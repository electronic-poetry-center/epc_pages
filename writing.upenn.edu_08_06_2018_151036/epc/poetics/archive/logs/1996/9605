see, here's where all this starts to get very, very tricky.  is "writing
through the body" ala cixous the same as "to write my body"?  seems to me
that there is a very subtle and very important difference that i can't
quite figure (hence my original question) between writing through the body
and writing the body.

i'm not sure that there is any particular music(/s) at stake here, but i
think we have to accept the fact that the music will be lost on some
people, which is why i think some folks like the music in creely (it had a
beat & i could dance to it) and some just don't see it.
 
the blues is a form(/s) that comes naturally to me, but try playing john
lee hooker at a bunch of kids from sri lanka that've never heard anything
close before.  (they wrinkled their noses considerable, were much less
polite to a late howlin wolf recording).  conversely, some of the
traditional music they played at me was a bunch of incoherent noise.  to
me.

I'd like to focus this a bit more. Almost all poetry is musical, so
that's not a good word, i think for the distinction that was wanted.
 
As far as the musical resemblences go, Taggart uses sound like Phillip
Glass while Creeley uses sound like Pierre Boulez. I'll keep all four of
them, thank you.   :)
 
I have no idea what "writing through the body" means. I'm inclined to
the talking head approach myself, projecting ideas in one respect, and
sculpting sound and diction in another.

I haven't read Cixious but I'd like to take a brief gestural crack at the
notion of "writing the body" from the philosophical context, the
discipline which I have a hunch Cixious is most likely referring to.
 
So just a guess, but I think Cixious is trying to consummate the critique
set in motion by Nietzsche.  Arguing against the will-less, body-less
tradtion of metaphysics, Nietzsche calls for an embodied, explicitly
will-full theory, one in which the seer is seen.  While the "will"
rhetoric has been dropped historically (partly due to Heidegger's
assessment that will is too metaphysical), the "body" notion was picked
up next, most significantly, by Merleau-Ponty (in part to flesh out
Heidegger's rather disembodied notion of Being).  So by mid-50's writing
the body would have meant something like Niet.'s "dwelling resolutely in the
fullness of being" which was in full existential crisis and committment
(so it's "writing the crisis"--strange revisionism on my part).
 
So since I haven't read any Cixious I have a glaring hole here, but, for
a contemporary take on bodily writing, I'd suggest Peter Sloterdijk's
example of the Greek anti-philosopher Diogenes.  The crux of Sloterdijk's
argument is that one can write the body without remaining
subject-centered.  That is, one can embody anti-subjectivity and take
physical pleasure in dissidence.  Diogenes writes with his cheeks (i.e.
he's "cheeky").  So writing the body can or could be a way of writing
through or against the subject.  (I remember last time the issue came up
Cixious was hinted at having the bias of feminist essentialism,perhaps true,
but perhaps she's calling for a tradition of embodied feminism, or as
French Fourierist Claire De Mar wrote in 1830's, a "rehabiliation of the
flesh".)
 
But that's just a blind shot since I haven't read Cixious nor am I a
philosopher.

Joshua

Must come in with those who rate the musicality of Creeley: the
compositional element, to me, is evident. Shaped sound. And yes, when he
reads it (or when it's read), it becomes a physical thing. "Reading in
silence is the source of half the misconceptions that have caused the
public to distrust poetry" - Bunting.
 
I first heard the name Martha Stewart on this list, and had no idea who
she was (tho I got the general idea) - now, I learn she's being hyped in
the UK, so pretty soon we'll all know the correct way to stuff an
aubergine, sorry, eggplant. In this context I've enjoyed parts of the
my-place-is-better-than-your-place thread: regional bickering certainly
beats cultural uniformity. But did you notice how all the UK voices went
quiet during the regional exchanges? I mean, we Northerners would never
say anything critical about life in the South, or vice versa...

Subject:      writing through Creeley's body
 
Two points, first: Creeley's musicality is obvious but tempered both by
speech (hence not reaching its 'upper limit music'-- this is not a bad
thing) and by attention to visual design of words on the page (which may
have musical effects in reading but is not the same as music at least in
my head).  The poetry-as-music metaphor has its limitations.
 
Second, on "writing through the body" -- are people here reading that as
always good?  Its attractiveness makes me suspicious.  Seems to me that
this idea (which I guess some here are reading as deriving from Cixous and
others) is complicated b/c of the confounding ideological status of the
body in American poetics at least since Olson and in some ways before.
Quote-mainstream-unquote poetics has sometimes found solace in a
somatically articulated poetics for its own relentless individualism.
Which leads me to ask what an embodied poetics might mean to do.  For my
own part, I'd like the theoretical base to be broadened a bit, to include
not only Cixous but also Foucault and Elaine Scarry, for both of whom the
body is socially produced and in no way a ground or origin.

Subject:      all this OPEN LETTER BUSINESS
 
Thanks to Bob Holman, Al Nielsen and others for their responses to my
letter--your points are well taken. I just had several matters I wanted
to clarify:
 
To Al: the issue, I guess, when one is talking about "community" is
probably less what sort of poetry one writes as it is often LITERALLY a
matter of where one hangs out--there are variances of poetic practice
within every community, but people choose to be active in certain social
areas rather than others. In that sense, my division between a
"performance/slam" crowd and an "avant garde" group sometimes is less a
matter of actual poetic differences than it is of social grouping. So I
don't really see that there was some attempt in my letter to narrowly
label what any particular poetry was doing, other than to talk about the
environments where they tend to gather as poets.
 
Bob, on one other point you made, at least three of the poets I mentioned
in my open letter are either tangentially or not associated with the
"avant garde" reading series at Ruthless Grip--in that sense, I
definitely WAS mentioning poets who are not particularly a part of my own
scene. I think the point you made about mentioning people from various
groups was important--but I wanted you to understand that I had already
done so in my previous letter.
 
Thanks for your good work on the program, and for responding to my concerns.

Subject:      one last bit of OPEN LETTER
 
I just left this last point out: Bob, I do see the point of sending
letters to the Washington Post, and I have actually done so about six
months ago on a really annoying article by Jonathan Yardley. I then also
sent a letter to the Washington City Paper on an article they wrote about
some novelist (I forget his name) who was attacking all poetry as "easy",
except for the recent work of Frederick Turner.
 
This is less to toot my own horn (a preposterous idea anyway) than to ask
you this: do you think that a letter sent to the Post about a three
paragraph letter that's a response to an article would actually get
published in the Post? My own assumption in this case was that it
wouldn't--hence my choice of sending you a letter this way. But if you
think it would, I'll certainly adjust my choice of location next time. It
just seemed to me that my concerns were too tangential to the original
debate to find their way into the Post.
 
I'd be interested to know what anybody thinks.

Not to argue that poetry and its debates should be further marginalized

Washington CITY PAPER could tear itself away from following Marion Barry
long enough to provide a showcase for the perf-po crowd, or the language
crowd, or the inter-crowd debates...

An embodied poetics would start by acknowledging that both poets & readers
are responding to effects & powers originating in language & nowhere else;
that these effects can be symbolized by analogy to the body or the reactions
poetry creates, but that if we are talking poetics perhaps we should
focus on specifically poetic effects.  It seems to me that evaluating
mainstream or other poetries in terms of what camp of critical sociology
they are perceived to fall into is putting the cart before the horse.
This may sound like blindered vision or neanderthal politics, but I for
one am sceptical of the critical presumption that always subsumes poetry
to some master discourse. This holds true even if your definition of
language includes silence, deed, nonverbal communication, gesture.

Wow.  As good a definition of writing-through-the-body as I've seen on
this list -- didn't somebody ask for one?  Should we start here, or
somewhere else?
 
I didn't mean to open the poet-vs.-theorist debate again, being both
myself.  Nor am I interested in subsuming poetry to anything (which to me
is as ridiculous as subsuming other things to poetry).  Shouldn't have
used the term "base," I suppose.  But I question whether anybody is
capable of fencing off "specifically poetic" from other effects.  (Your
own rather territorial phrasing, Henry, makes me think otherwise).  After
all, this discussion, if I remember, started off with somebody asking
whether writing-through-the-body required writing in the first or second
person.
 
Cheers,
David

I think I understand the distinctions you're drawing here, but it's hard
for me to imagine hearing Creeley's rhythms in relation to Boulez.  He
(Creeley) is just too American (in terms of rhythm & vocabulary) to seem as
European as Boulez.  Perhaps Elliott Carter (though he seems a lot more
interested in John Ashbery's work) would be more appropriate, or Milton
Babbitt.
 
I'm not complaining about Boulez' work as such, though there are other
composers I'm far more interested in (more than Carter or Babbitt, too, for
that matter).  If I were to make this kind of comparison, I'd probably
compare Creeley to one of the more idiosyncratic jazz players, say, Herbie
Nichols or Sonny Clark, in the fifties, or Steve Lacy today (if you want to
call that jazz).
 
But that's if I were to make this kind of comparison.

place from May 7 to 11 right where you are. The program is too thick to
type up, feels like a mini-MLA, but you should be able to get one right
there & I doubt that it's booked up or out. (for more information you
could call Campus Information [703 993-2090] or the Conference
Coordinator, John Foster at 703 993-2774 or email him: jfoster@gmu.edu.
 
Note, however, one of the panels, meeting on Thursday 9-12 a.m. in the
Movie Theatre (inneresting place!) on the Ground Floor, & moderated by
yours truly: THE ECHO OF THE ORIGINAL: TRANSLATION AS ARENA FOR THE DRAMA
OF CULTURE with Charles Bernstein, Ann Leatherwood, Suzanne Jill Levine,
Howard Norman & Andrew Schelling.
 
Also, for those in DC area, the previous evening, Wednesday at 8 pm,
Bernstein & Joris will be reading at Rod Smith's bookshop.

     If you are interested in defining writing through the body in the
     manner that Charles Alexander suggests, one that is multi-valent, I
     would suggest _Just Whistle_ by C.D. Wright. If you find language to
     be an artifice, as Henry Gould suggests, or at least artificial enough
     to deem an acknowledgement necessary then I'd start out with Toril
     Moi, preferably Sexual Textual Politics as a primer for some of the
     universal definitions inherent in the word body's semiotic screen.
 
     Be Well.

Subject:      Re: all this OPEN LETTER BUSINESS
 
    Mr. Wallace raises a good point about social scene vs. aesthetic "bent"--
    I think the former causes a lot of walls that are often attributed to
    the latter (more than the other way around, it seems).
    For instance, Jeff McDaniel. When I became aware of Jeff, it was through
    meeting him in a bookstore and a shared enthusiasm about people like BILL
    KNOT (hardly a slam poet, though he has tangential social connections with
    the NY SCHOOL--zavatsky, etc.) and even more MFA types like James Tate.
    Such affinities are evident in his book. And since I've never seen him
    perform, I can't say much about his SLAM side. But, I'm told he does that
    way (Bob Holman---I still haven't got to a friend's to watch USOP on TV.
    so I don't know if McDaniel is there "represented". It will be soon).
    Anyway, so I consider him a crossover, or a straddler in that sense.
    So, I don't know if people actually choose "scenes" or if scenes choose
    people......more later, chris

From Laura at GHawkins@halcyon.com.
 
Mark,
 
I can't believe what happened at Port Arthur, send deep condolensces-- I
had tea at that little cafe a couple of years ago (w/ TT.O, Lauren
Williams, Eric Beach as tour guides during the Salamanca fest.), walked
around the prison, was mortified by the kitschy little sailboat in the
museum-- "Port Arthur, place of misery."  I remember Hobart and Tasmania on
the whole as a safe place to travel , the last place on earth where
hitchhiking is fun not terrible.  So I'm sad about the shooting.
 
 
They're calling this the first massacre to happen there.  But it isn't at
all, as any Koori or half-decent historian can tell us.
 
This stuff happens here more often than not (I walk into Mac Donalds
expecting to get shot, actually); I hope it doesn't become common to
Tassie.
Regards,
Laura
 
P.S. Got 24 Hours as well as Southerly.  Both are great!
Chris Mann's coming to Seattle May 21, will perform "I don't hate America,
I regret it" at Speakeasy (I expect that's the
piece he'll do).

I'm not surprised at all about Tassie. I taught there, married a woman
from there, fled from there. I found more hatred there than just about
anywhere I've been - hatred even in the wake of the genocide of the
aboriginals - hated against gays that was close to unbelievable - hatred
against punks, against the new romantics, against anyone different -
hatred against Americans. They liked poofter-bashing as relaxation,
drinking themselves into oblivion, and the Queen. I have no fond memories
from the colonizing colony; I know too many people who were knived.

I opened the bait can, though.  Effects are effects, but theory
is something else.  Theory is reasoned discourse.  Poetry reaches
for something further (not all poetry, but poetry in essence).
Silence measures human discourse, not the other way around.
Word is primordial, sometimes appears as poetry, sometimes as
"poetry". Truth-manifestation not subject to argument (though
the sceptic is allowed to scratch where it itches). This shows
the real value of reasoned discourse.  When words reach the

Subject:      should be on back of xxxx can
 
Did anybody see this. A reuter piece from london in the NZ Herald or local raag.
Abridged by me.
 
Title "POETS TOO CRAZY TO GET SO BLUE'
 
POets are crazier than authors or playwrights, but less likely to becamo
depressed or alcoholics, a British psychiatrist reported yesterday.
It could be because of the way their imaginations work, Dr Felix Post...said.
Dr POst examined 100 famous MALE brit & US writers and poets by looking at
their biographies. Many good bio's provide enough detail to do an accurate
psych. analysis - "They've got to be really good biographies" Post sd.
His previous study found writers more likely to have mental or emotional
probs. than other people like scientists or POLITICIANS.
BUT POETS did not follow the trend "the poets were less unstable and had
fewer depressions than others"
He said poets had more mood swings and manic depressions requiring
hospitalisation.
But they were less likely than writers... to die young or become promiscuous.
Only 31% of the poets were alcoholics compared to 54% of playwrights.
...writing of any sort is linked to poor mental health... psychosis or
depression evident in 80% of poets 80.5% novelists & 87.5% playwrights.
HALF THE POETS FAILED TO EVER ACHEIVE "COMPLETE SEXUAL UNION", while 42% of
playwrights known for promiscuity...
Dr Post sd it could be down to personality differences or the way writers or
poets work.
"I speculate that it is the imagination of novelists and playwrights, who
are far more concerned with intimate human fate - they've got to identify
and empathise with they're characters", DR POSt said "They have greater
stress in their writing."
AS FOR THE POETS "they don't deal with human fate. They JUST DESCRIBE THEIR
REligious feelings or their love."
DR POst said his study did not include women writers as women tend to have
different patterns of mental illness from men and his study period STARTING
IN 1840, HAD TOO FEW WOMEN WRITERS. (would there have been more had it
started earlier)
 
END.
 
i wonder there will soon be a POet box to tick on medical insurance forms.
 
Just though you might be amused / or something.

Milton A.Cohen has a book out called _Poet and Painter:  The Aesthetics of
E.E. Cummings' Early Work_, that explores Cummings' lifelong fascination
with intertwining the two (he did both quite well).

Of course Tasmania is a conservative state with a background similiar to
many other colonised areas (I mean the rest of Australia has a similiar
(hidden) history of open warfare against Aborignal people. But then I
recall a long running debate on this list about the certain mid western US
states which sound like they contain many of the same contradictions which
abound in Tasmania. Tasmania does have the most repressive anti gay laws in
Australia but they also have a strong and growing gay lobby group which
have openning challenged the laws. They have perhaps the strongest
conservation movement in the country and the Greens currently hold the
balance of power in State Parliment. There is also a thriving arts
community centred around Hobart which puts many larger Australian centres
to shame.
 
I wonder if the hatred you speak about is really more real than the hatred
that exists just below the surface in major centres (such as Sydney and New
York??).......Its a difficult question trying to come to terms with a
culture which results in such a tradegy as the Port Arthur shooting - at
the same time we have to question a media which allows such an event to
overshadow all the other ongoing tradegies around the world which result in
many more deaths than an isolated shooting...........
 
Anyway as you can tell I am still feeling numb.. the local media has been
full of the shooting for days. The gun control debate has resurfaced and
the gun lobby is running scared (at the same time there has been a rush to
buy semi automatic rifles in case there is a ban)................

Comments: To: kellogg@ACPUB.DUKE.EDU
 
David,
      yes. Speech is a mouth/ I hate speech. mmmmmmm.....
      Projective Verse, as with projective painting, as with projective
jazz, bebop, was/is to be produced/received 'through the body.' And is
by those means and to that extent writing intent on refusing the
individualism you refer to, and  Joshua Schuster's subject center. At
least that's what I've always thought, but I do constantly encounter
'misreadings' which state the opposite.    Henry's 'clarification' makes
for a difference; for argument's sake there would be WRITING through the
body, or READING through the body. (I have to say,though, the whole
expression has worn out its welcome with me,'writing through the body'
sounds like some awful morphing activity, like what happened to smurfs
what got left on the electric fire.)
     As to Creeley 'n jazz; he has himself over the years spoken, in
letters to Olson, in several interviews, at length and more to the point
with characteristic particularity about the relation of behop esp. to
his own writing. I recall discussions of the' body language' of the
musicians, close readings of Parker, of Monk and 4 beats, of the records
to which specific chapters of The Island were written to, and a  long
section of the recent Sagetreib interview....

An interesting place to go w/ the Creeley & music discussion is the album HOME
an ECM album recorded in the early 80's. Steve Swallow (an electric bassist then

them to music. At at St. Amark's talk at that period, Creeley praised the
collaboration & noted that Swallow respected his line breaks and stanzas -- rare
when compsoers tackle poetry. There is also a long piece where Lacy set A
Creeley text to music(on hat Hut).Creeley's early poems provide a fascinating
take on a poet's responce to the burgeoning bop scene going round him (see his
letters to Olson at the time), this was a period of intense listening for
Creeley... as far as classical music connection, I often think of a link between
Cage's pre-aleatoric piano pieces (late 30's -early '40's) and Creeley's poetry.
Where they at Black Mountain at the same time???

Alan,
 
Any American going abroad who does not have a knife held to the throat at
some point simply because they are American misses out on one of most
eye-opening experiences travel offers-- in Tasmania one bloke shouted he
was going to "kill an American (me) for Peace."  I talked him out of it,
bought him a beer-- he'd been sent to Vietnam, I found out in our
conversation.  An Australian in Vietnam.  Of course they hate Americans.
 
An "ocker" can hold a candle to our own brand of bigot, yes, however the
American left and artists have a long way to go to even touch the coattails
of their Australian counterparts-- TT.O., thalia, Chris Mann, ACR, Jas
Duke, Lauren Williams, Eric Beach, Carmel Bird (to name a very very small
few!) and, in the music scene Penelope Swales (Alanis Morissette, eat yr
heart out).  On Tasmania alone, that little heart-shaped detail at the
bottom of our maps, the number of active youth per capita far supercedes
that of the same in the USA.  Living directly under the hole in the ozone
has its pressures.
 
So, Alan, maybe the wallaby rissoles didn't appeal, but I think America can
learn a lot from the Tasmanian, and the Australian, greens, feminists,
writers, artists, poets, and, in simple terms "LEFT."
 
I shouldn't be surprised that weird people with guns open fire anyplace
these days, yes, but the shock's always there.
 
Regards,
Laura

        I was in Tasmania last month and visited Port Arthur, a
stunningly beautiful place with an awful history.  I met many kind,
generous, and rigorous folks, along with one rather nasty cab driver
(though not as nasty as the NYC scam artists I once fell for).
 
        On a literary note, I highly recommend contemporary Australian
poetry.  I was on a panel at the Salamanca Writers Festival with John
Kinsella, Philip Mead, Hazel Smith, and Joanne Burns, all of whom are
excellent writers (and performers).  In Sydney: Pam Brown, Denis
Gallagher, John Tranter, Kate Lilley.  There are lots and lots of
others.  The main problem is that hardly any Australian poetry is
published in the USA.  This is a real shame, especially since the people I
met
were all very knowledgeable about American poetry, and Frank O'Hara is
something of a cult figure there.

No wonder people hate speech, since speech has no taste, no sense, just
lingers dusty and dead in the casualty of vocality.  But is speech
impossible to swallow?
 
I've been chewing on this idea of writing the body (which now, as Wynstan
notes, is sounding rather hollow) so I'll just throw up and out some
additional comments.  But first, to save my theoretical butt I'll conjure
up some poetheory w/ Barthes: "One might call "poetic" (without value
judgment) any discourse in which the word leads the idea."
 
First it seems the body can be taken (abducted) as both singular and
plural.  And if plural, there is a whole panoply of bodies, social,
political, perversive.  Writing the body does quiver between the personal
and impersonal.
 
Again, I see writing the body as a possible way of embodying
anti-subjectivity, an assertion of one's congealing physical presence
without necessarily collaborating in self-service.  So I find writing the
body a way to undermine writing the biography (writing the morgue).
 
Also re: projective verse and Olson, I just wanted to toss out a mere
idea without any extended evidence: I think there are striking
similarities between Olson's notion of proprioception and Heidegger's
disclosing and dwelling Being.  But I have no warrant for that arrest.
 
(Also unrelated, I just remembered
McCaffery has a great extended passage in _Panopticon_ on the ecstatic
polysemic possibilities of writing the body/text, but haven't my copy w/ me.)

Joshua

Susan, did you stay at the writer's cottage up above the wharfs?
 
I read at the Salamanca Festival (fringe) in 91 so it's great to hear it
mentioned.  I agree that the whole of Australian writing is ignored by the
States' distributors; Carmel Bird's name appeared on the back pages of Best
Short Stories of 91 but it's impossible to find her work in print over here
(few years back I did find "Woodpecker Point" but nothing since).  Check
out Mark Robert's work on the Aus. Writers on Line (AWOL) webpage and
electronic bookshop.  http://www.ozemail.com.au/~awol/bookshop1.html .
You'll find your mates there.
 
This may be the only way.

Thanks for the plug (AWOL). In fact if anyone is hunting down an Australian
poet let AWOL know (awol@ozemail.com.au) even if they don't appear on the
bookshop page we might be able to track them down.

ok. so long as you see the point i was making, which is that creeley's music is of a
different esthetic from taggart's, as boulez or carter is from glass. Both are very
musical to my ear. i don't see the need to restrict parallel's by nationality. and
also, to my ear, the long melodic lines of jazz are a lot different from what i hear
coming off creeley's page, but i don't know the specific people you mentioned. carter's
lines are longer than creeley's, too. olson's more like carter ... this is going
nowhere ... ack!
 
this is an artificial distinction anyway. each is deliciously unique.

Yogi,
 
What little Australian-New Zealand writing that has gotten through to my
benighted suburb of poetry got through in the pages of the magazine
Scripsi. John Tranter crossed over briefly in the late 80s early 90s, some
sad amazing poems in the Paris Review I think. Michael Heyward, too. These
two though it seems to me are the closest to the New York School of the
Australian-NZ scene, n'escafe? A. Curnow's selected pops up from time to

Kevin,
 
There's lots of work done on this kind of writing, including several books
on Williams.  A book that's part anthology and part critical study is
Jacqueline Vaught Brogan, *Part of the Climate: American Cubist Poetry* (U
of California P, 1991). Of course, that's limited to American poetry, as
the title says.  There's also Wendy Steiner's *The Colors of Rhetoric*; I
forget the publication information, but I remember it as strong if overly
jargon-ridden.  The first other anthologies to look at are Rothenberg's,
from *Technicians of the Sacred* to the present *Poems for the Millenium*
(with Pierre Joris), which in my view provides the broadest anthology
context ever put together for the intersection of poetry and other art,
including painting.
 
Cheers,
David

It's those misreadings which I was trying to raise, misreadings which make
the language of writing thru the body available for such a wide range of
writing practices that (tho I am attracted greatly to the idea and the
rhetoric) I find it hard to understand it as meaningful.  Maybe I read in
Jed Rasula's book that William STAFFORD, of all people, thought of
"Projective Verse" as obvious.  If *that* can happen, then the idea of
writing through the body needs to be seen in terms of its flexibility and
its broad attractions, and questioned on that same ground.
 
A personal note: several years ago (1991) I published a piece in Sagetrieb
on Olson & the body.  It retrospect it doesn't seem very strong for a
bunch of reasons, some of which I've alluded to here.  So I'm basically
torn on the whole damned issue.
 
Cheers,
David

Since this conversation intersects with the one on visual poetry, I would
suggest that people with web access look at the marvelous Light & Dust site.
Its table of contents is at http://www.thing.net./~grist/l&d/lighthom.htm
 
Included there are visual poems by Paul Dutton (this one also a sound, in
printed form), Karl Kempton, Kajina Kyuyo, Philadelpho Menezes, Clemente
Padin, Carl Lynden Peters, Yamanaka Ryojiro, and others. Also criticism
present here, including Menezes's introduction & conclusion to Poetics and
Visuality; and Karl Young's Introduction to Karl Kempton's visual poems
which make up the book Rune: A Survey.

it's Gia Vlaencia, the daughter of the mad Spanish anthropologist sage

not sure if this is of help, but Dick Higgins, former fluxus activist,
publisher (something else press), poet and scholar is THE authority on
pattern poems, or concrete poetry; he did a study of George Herbert's

Subject:      word leading the idea
 
Joshua referred to Barthes' "One might call "poetic" (without value
judgment) any discourse in which the word leads the idea."
 
I like this idea, but wonder whether it's the word _leading_ the idea, or the
words conducting a discourse/dance that is separate from the idea. Could we say
that the 'poetic' is the dance of the signifiers, while the 'narrative' is the
dance of the signifieds? Though of course my use of the word 'separate' is too
reductive: there can (should?) be play or counterpoint (my metaphors now not so
much mixed as pureed) between the word-dance & the idea-dance.
 
& we read the 'poetic' as well as the 'narrative' (form never _less_ than an
extension of content?), though possibly in very different modes (musical/
analytical). & I wonder where the word might lead the idea, if we follow it
right down the garden path ... no ideas but in words?
 
 
Yours &c,
 
Tom Beard.

I tried to post an answer to your query about transgender criticism on
Stein once before and for some reason my post never appeared.  I hope
this works.  There are a couple of earlier accounts that you might
consult, if nothing else just to see how much more thinking still needs
to be done on this subject.  A couple of not-so-recent essays by
Catherine Stimpson are "Getrice/Altrude:  Stein, Toklas, and the Paradox
of the Happy Marriage" and another for which I am missing the title, but
I know the phrase "Lesbian Lie" or "Lies" is in there somewhere.  Also,
you might look at "A Signature of Lesbian Autobiography" by Leigh
Gilmore, also not-so-recent.

Subject:      writing threw the body
 
In following the thread, "through", I found Joshua Schuster's history of the
take(s) on the body real good but more what we should read and not perhaps
what we might do, because poetics means that the body is also on the take.
Hence the addition by D. Kellog of Elaine Scarry and Foucault to which I
would add Anne Hollander's "Seeing through clothes".  the "through" here
being that the depiction of bodies was/is in-formed by the current cut and
paste idea of clothes, and implies media and transmission, and so too
"through" the body.
H.Gould added:
<<An embodied poetics would start by acknowledging that both poets & readers
are responding to effects & powers originating in language & nowhere else;
that these effects can be symbolized by analogy to the body or the reactions
poetry creates, but that if we are talking poetics perhaps we should
focus on specifically poetic effects.>>
I would suggest that the opposite is more productive: that language,
discourses, formal systems and logics arose from the body finding/making
(pro-finding, profound-ing) a relation to its own thinking. This is a
question for Poetics: How do I work this thing.  It is a question  of
engagement and AEffection. The runnings back and forth (of discourse(s),
show an ORIENTATION, each discourse is an orientation of the body towards
its "expressions" (in the medical sense). Writing through the body
foregrounds the orientation that is aeffected and in-formed by the bodily.
Thinking produces experience, different discourses produce likewise
different aeffectations, the body produce experience that the brain thinks
about. The body also thinks for itself.  The INTERESTING THING is that there
is a willful confusion of these, they approximate and overlap strongly and
because they do, they create the possibilities of other, 2nd, 3rd, and even
centered person(s). Giving voice (an interesting bodily problem considering
all the work that actors and singers do just on disposition, the fact that
over 200 muscles connect into the throat and controls the "lips of the
voice" means that the way the muscles are connected hold or flex, lengthen,
harden, walk sit, etc. effect the finding of the physical instrument of the
voice.) and then giving voice to a fictive, imagined, projected, physical,
internally isolated, prosthetic or socially constructed body, is the search
and research of that which shows up only as the poetic effects. It is true
this is all we see, but we read also through our sense of poetics, not just
through our sense of text.
POETICS IS NOT ABOUT POETRY, andit is this relation of body to its thoughts
that needs a Poetics. Discourse follows by "Writing through the body"or not.
Foregrounding (the body) does not have to be a prioritizing, it can, and in
this case does, imply loss or negligence as a source (real or other-wise)
w/o making it foremost. Our dispositions have grown acustomed and our taste
adjusted to theoretical, literary & scientific voices (re: D.Byrd post on
"taste for theory" some time ago) more than, for example, an all-flesh
(pancreatic) one. But,this is life in the eyes ears nose mouth and the
legacy of sensations produced by reflective values.

From babble and play to poetry: some philosophical reflections
on writing through the vocal cords:
 
"From the standpoint of articulation, phonic freeplay strips
the infant of the manifold benefits of political conversation.
In being not yet human, the infant is nonhuman.  For the play
that (as yet) avoids the work of commanding the organs of speech
is the action of a creature imprisoned by its vital functions.
Infancy, for Hobbes, is retribution and imprisonment, a
repetition of the fall at Babylon.  In that condition, being and
action, lacking rigor and retentiveness, are reduced to play...
As play, babble is a pleasure onto itself.  The infant babbles
for no reason other than the fact that free sound production is
pleasing...the organism as vocal instrument plays and is played
upon pleasurably ...This is the instrument before tuning ...
Sound is process rather than production.  (pp. 76 - 77)
     "Figures and metaphors....serve to remove the ambiguous
sting of the poem hat cuts through our ordinary preoccupations
to the intense terror of the primordial question.  not knowing
who we are nor why we exist, we raise voice in the poem in the
hope of eliciting a response....The poems voice, voice's voice,
destroys the illusions by which shame and self-deception deaden
thought, feeling, and sensate life.(pp. 112 - 113)"

This entire post was very interesting; body-centered anti-theory theory.
The relation to performance (I'm thinking of Pindar & choruses & dramatic
poetry) might prove useful sometime.  I think the point I was trying to
make is that poetry is a form of communication, i.e. a language; that
keeping this in mind might help interpreters & readers in navigating
various claims of "writing through the body" - between what is simply
playing out of metaphors & what is gesture & body-language etc. - and
might forestall simplistic value-judgements about repression/expression
etc.  Whether coming from the groin or the groan or the grin I would
want to withhold calling it "poetry" until I was able to grasp to
some extent what is the poetic-communicative message/massage gestalt
or whatever. Poetics IS about poetry, that by gum I'll stand-by. - HG

Still catching up on old threads.
  Yes, it's Ann Kong's pig farm not ant farm--her answering machine OGM even
throws in an "Oink, Oink": sorry for the typo.   A year or so ago, Steve
Dickison of Small Press Distribution told me of his epiphanous feeling when
he connected the poems and contributor's note he'd just read in the
Premonitions galleys with the bleach bottle pigs surrounding him and the busy
cook or manager who was ordering people around.  When Chris Daniels suggested
that the connection with poetry was perhaps "the sweet human ability to love
such a thing as a bleach bottle pig --- but i am speaking entirely of myself"
something connected for me.  Recently I was obsessed with buying all
different sorts of stuffed toy rabbits (as well as books, calendars about
rabbits, etc.--but no chocolate bunnies) for a rabbit-adoring friend.  It
helped, of course, that it was right before Easter, when thousands of rabbits
come out of their warehouse hutches to perch on retail shelves.  This led me
to think more generally of toys and dolls again.  Maybe one connection is
that poems are like "dolls" or miniature replicas of language (and therefore
inherently "unheimlich"/uncanny?) and here of course one means much more than
a "faithful" reproduction of it, but a prototype, put out in simulated
conditons (its relation to "the world", breath, etc.)--I recall also the
quotation that Pierre Joris uses in his posts to this list--poetry as the
promise of a language, although I wonder if Pierre could spare the time to
fill us in a little more on the type of promise being intimated here.  I'm
sure it's related to why I titled my anthology "Premonitions."
 
   Finally, if Chris Daniels, Emily Lloyd, Maria D., Ron Silliman, and
"mikl-em" don't mind, I would like to copy the Ann Kong/Pig Farm thread and
send it as a greeting to Ann?  Do any of you object?  Back-channel me at

>walter, I was about an hour ahead of your pointing towards ann kong...just
got my copy of *Premonitions*, and yes, I enjoyed her work very much.  (tho
curious: who do you have in mind when you say "better than most of the more
well-known US poets of Lesbos? not at all disagreeing, just wondering who
these are for you). seems as if asian voices have been particularly
silenced/absent/whatever from lesbian poetry (good to see inverse not true
here)<
Emily--Sorry for the late reply on this.   At that instant I was thinking of
a few active white poets born after 1950 or so who have received some
prestigious mainstream prizes.  Although the fact Kong's published so little
makes comparisons unfair, I just find the poignant/acerbic,
nostalgic/mystical, dark/ardent fresh nostalgia of her poems more vivid and
well sung.  But, of course, there is as much diversity among "poets of
Lesbos" as there is among any other grouping and once one considers more
poets, it becomes less fruitful to say one is better than the other because
what they are doing is so different, sometimes contrary.
  And where does the queerness reside, emerge?  For there is also the
question of the difference between a queer poem and a poem seen queerly--how
the latter becomes a "critically" queer poem (brought to a "crisis")?  (And
there are also, of course, queer poems seen straight.)  I'm thinking on the
analogy of how queer film criticism un-represses Hollywood texts and the
Eliot-Pound analysis in Wayne Koestenbaum's  _Double Talk, The Erotics of
Male Literary Collaboration_ (Routledge 1989).  There are also a range of
texts in between, say, erotic queer poems and homophobic poems seen queerly:
a work like Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's DICTEE, for instance--and here I'm just
following up on a suggestion thrown at me one afternoon by the young
filmmaker and critic Quentin Lee (USC Film School) one day as he ran down a
hall to the next panel.  DICTEE!, he said, if that's not a queer text, I
don't know what is!  Its epigraph is stated as being from Sappho and each of
its nine chapters is devoted simultaneously to one of the muses and another
more "historical" female figure of adoration (e.g. Joan of Arc, the Korean
patriot martyr Yu Guan Soon); aside from passages of ecstatic appeals to or
invocations of Christ, heterosexual relations are almost completely neglected
or only ironically referred to (there is a criticism of conventional
matrimony).  On the other hand, sexual attraction or acts are never a
narrative element in the book, the Sappho quotation is faked, and certainly
none of the growing literature on DICTEE has thought to view it as a Lesbian
or even erotic text.  Maybe it's just a matter of time.

Brogan's book starts around 1910 and ends with the early 1940s.  I'm not
nearly expert enough to judge its accuracy.  One of the interesting things
about its arrangement is that it organizes poems according to their
original place of publication (magazine), so that Williams, for example,
appears in sections devoted to "Others," "Broom,"  "Secession," "The
Exile," "Hound & Horn," "Blues," and "New Directions in Poetry and Prose
1936."
 
Brogan's definition of cubist poetry is pretty loose, so Stevens seems
more prominent in this regard than he might be under a more narrow
classificaiton.  Other prominent figures in the book are Loy, Stein,
cummings, Zukofsky (including "Poem beginning 'The'" (!!)), Winters,
Rexroth.  Some reviews and editorials from the period are also included.
 
Cheers,
David

re: Emily Lloyd's inquiry about >kitty tsui, who's not in
*Premonitions* but is highly anthologized & regarded in the queergirl
community.<
 
A good observation.  One of the functions of _Premonitions_ was to question
the repeated anthologization of certain Asian American poets, according to
the criteria stated in its Afterword.  You will note that the book does not
include a good number of poets that have become the standard "Asian American"
inclusions in mainstream and/or multiculturalist anthologies, ranging from
the Norton's to  jazz poetry collections, if they did not send work that was
not already well-circulated or not significantly different from their
previously celebrated writing.  Another frequently included queer poet who
does not appear in Premonitions is Nellie Wong, much of whose work I love.
 It was time to give anthology space to willyce kim (the first openly Asian
American lesbian writer to publish whole volumes of poetry, she's also
published two very episodic novels, and is stacks supervisor at the UC
Berkeley library), Thelma Seto, Ann Kong, and work like the video "Red
Lolita" (which its artist, Gloria Park says is not queer, but I feel
nonetheless wonderfully evokes queer issues--do you agree?).  It's good to
hear that Kitty is highly regarded in queergirl circles; I hope this will be
true of a wider range of poets in the near future and that it will encourage
them to publish more.  But then this is beginning to sound so patronizing I
start to wonder why

     I would suggest going to the source: Mallarme's A throw of the dice
     will never abolish chance. And then on to Selected Essays, Letters,
     and Prose which is on Johns Hopkins (1956?). Whatever is to remain
     sacred must be shrouded in mystery.
 
     If the interest is in WCW specifically, try out _Cubism, Steglitz, and
     WCW_  (Dykstra was the author I believe).
     If your interest is in the formations of concrete poetry in the US,
     check out Kenneth Patchen's Journal of Albion Moonlight, Sleepers
     Awake, or the painting books especially the fairly recent color one
     _What shall we do without us?_ After these I would check out an
     anthology of concrete poetry that Richard Kostelanetz put together in
     1972, there's a book on Illinois UP (or the Ann Arbor Writer's on
     Writing Series book) that will give you the name of which anthology
     deals with the subject
     As far as criticism the best book I've read on the subject was a
     recent one (1994) which traced the work of the painter, Francis Bacon,
     with semiotic and linguistic theory. The book is wild, giving an
     involved assessment of possible narratologies that are availiable to
     painters. Here I am again sans library. It should be easy to find,
     with the exception of David Sylvester's books there are only 2 or 3
     others written that aren't purely art books.

Subject:      Writing Threw the Brain
 
The recent discussion on writing through the body reminded me of a long quote
from Julian Jaynes' "The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the of the
Bicameral Mind" I used in a piece I wrote about a year ago.  I used it to
emphasize how imagination and experience are often juxtaposed in descriptions of
form, but I think it's also a good example, in the extreme, of the tendency to
invoke biological determinism once the body is established as a locus or origin
of a given process or action, a condition which is probably a result, not a
cause, of what Jondi Keane called "the legacy of sensations produced by
reflective values."
 
"Poetry begins as the divine speech of the bicameral mind.  Then as the
bicameral mind breaks down, there remain prophets.  Some become
institutionalized as oracles making decisions for the future.  While others
become specialized into poets, relating from the gods statements about the past.
Then, as the bicameral mind shrinks back from its impulsiveness, and as perhaps
a certain reticence falls upon the right hemisphere, poets who are to obtain
this same state must learn to do it.  As this becomes more difficult, the state
becomes a fury, and then ecstatic possessions, just as happened in the oracles.
And then indeed toward the end of the first millennium B. C., just as the
oracles began to become prosaic and their statements versified consciously, so
poetry also.  Its givenness by the unison Muses has vanished.  And conscious men
now wrote and crossed out and careted and rewrote their compositions in
laborious mimesis of the older divine utterances" (Jaynes 374-375).
 
"Bicameral men did not imagine; they experienced.  The beautiful Muses with
their unison "lilly-like" voice, dancing out of the thick mists of evening,
thumping on soft and vigorous feet about the lonely enraptured shepherd, these
arrogances of delicacy were the hallucinatory sources of memory in the late
bicameral men, men who did not live in a frame of past happenings, who did not
have 'lifetimes' in our sense, and who could not reminisce because they were not
fully conscious" (Jaynes 371).

If the body writes, then if we define the body as some kind of separate
locus-organism, we simply create an old Descartian grid with new vocabulary.
What's the body? The body is part of a cosmos-body-thingum. But I will
admit - breathing sometimes helps writing.

Nagy's book Poetry as Performance is again relevant here, where he
describes the Alexandrian codification & centralization of both the
Homeric poems and the Septuagint (a movement begun supposedly in both
cases by one person! Now what-th-body was his name...some Greek...)
into texts - the "descent" from script to scripture...

Subject:      As Williams is to painting/photography
 
It seems to me that with all the parallels we drew between poets and
music, noone compared WCW to a musical type. Perhaps he, and Creeley,
are better compared to painters and photographers than to musicians. Not
that this is the only way to see them, but maybe it's a more appropriate
pair-'o-dig-'em.

painting followed by a preference for the rather lighter materials required
for poetry construction...perhaps the book is still in print.   mrh

I suspect that the book on Francis Bacon, title of which Baratier was trying
to come up with, was "Francis Bacon & the Loss of Self," by Ernst van Alphen,
smart young Nederlandish literary scholar; UK edition, Reaktion Books, 1992,
don't know about the US edition.  Good as it is, I'm not sure it's all that
relevant to the current thread: has more to do with narrative than with the
visual in poetry.

Subject:      Re: Writing Threw the Brain
 
wrt this question of the body, and ward tietz's intriguing response to
jondi keane's intriguing elaboration:  i too have found mind vs. body
controversies to be reflected in the mind/brain couple, esp. given that
many cogsci researchers see the 90s as the "decade of the brain"... seems
to me one might look at related articulations to ascertain what they yield
in this context... chief among which, way back at the beginning of the 90s,
are mark turner's _reading minds:  the study of english in the age of
cognitive science_ (princeton up, 1991) and what i would pose almost as a
retort to turner, francisco varela/evan thompson/eleanor rosch's _the
embodied mind_ (mit p, 1991)... i far prefer the varela et. al. text to the
turner treatment, albeit it too is not w/o its liabilities... note that
three of turner's chapters are entitled "the poetry of connections" (!)...
his is an attempt to reproduce the logic of cognitive science at the level
of language practice, incl. metaphor (through "cognitive rhetoric")...
extremely deterministic, yes, even an implied *genetic* gradient mebbe, yet
a measure of the sorts of reductions one might expect when looking to
science alone to furnish answers to questions that invoke
socially-constitutive practices...
 
i might in this context also mention richard powers' superb novel _the gold
bug variations_... i know of no book that goes as far in exploring
language/dna intricacies...
 
anyway, it's likely that any simple theoretical or scientific access to the
body will result in a reification... on the other hand, i can't quite
imagine how we're to understand the body as a language-organism without
recourse both to poetic and to (properly conceived)
scientific/technological thinking (such as, for example, maturana and
varela's "autopoiesis," which resonates well with olson's
"proprioception")... that is, my own predilection is for a more complex
understanding of language as it relates to the organism, and without (for
example) eliminating that social gradient... but that's just me...

Subject:      Cite Lines: Duncan/Olson
 
Here are two questions:
 
--> Does anyone have a *clue* where this quote from Robert Duncan might have
come from? It's a passage I'm very fond of. (My thought is it's from a
periodical but I can't seem to find it in that _Sulfur_ 35 with the special
Duncan stuff. So then I'm thinking - what other periodical might it be - if
it is in a periodical??)
 
"When poets were really jugglers, they got everything in the air and
bouncing around. In that period they wanted that out of poetry, they wanted
an amazing assortment of things."
 
--> "Form is never more than an extension of content". Of course Olson
refers to Creeley saying this in his "Projective Verse" essay. BUT - is this
a quote that exists anywhere? I've looked through the correspondence and I
do see some wording similar to this but I don't find this EXACT quote. (ie,
what Olson cites of Creeley in Creeley's own words) Did I miss this? Is it
common knowledge that Olson is rephrasing Creeley and I am simply unaware of
it???
 
You may of course, if you prefer - respond to me directly and not to the
list: lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu
 
Thanks!

WHAT YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND IS POETRY
IS CONNECTED TO THE BODY AGAIN
 
 
 
Jean allowed the body to drop
The beautiful face bluing so perfect
A fly buzzed by - but no one would believe it
She raced frantically to the offices of the National Enquirer
A reporter wrote up the story - it made the cover
Now she could get the attention of the radical newsweekly
That only told the truth
She just casually flipped it down on the desk
"Hey," an editor reading upside-down said,
"What if this story is true? It would certainly change
Our story - maybe we should look into this.
Hey! Stop those presses!"
 
Jean walked away. Horns were blaring,
It was a brilliant dusty sunset and the sirens were distorting.
She didn't hear em.
She was remembering her lover's face,
What they'd said about how you never know
If someone else's orgasm is better than yours
But that shoudn't stop you
From coming together
Even if it's not exactly
At the same time.

In Creeley's letter to O -- Monday / june 5 / 1950 (anniversary next
month!) -- "Anyhow, form has now become so useless a term/ that I blush to
use it.  I wd imply a little of Stevens' use (the things created in a
poem and existing there . . .) & too, go over into: the possible casts or
methods for a way into/ a 'subject': to make it clear: that form is never
more than an extension of content.  An enacted or possible 'stasis' for
thought.  Means to."
 
You'll find it in _The Complete Correspondence_ Vol. I -- in the Black
Sparrow edition (1980) where i found it, on p. 79.
 
& just for fun: "Stevens' use" refers back to an earlier letter (April
28/50) in which Creeley: "Thinking of Stevens, who slipped into PR, with
this: 'Poetic form in its proper sense is a question of what appears
within the poem itself. . .  By appearance within the poem itself one
means the things created and existing there. . .'  Basic."  -- A note
gives the Stevens quote from: a symposium on "The State of American
Writing, 1948," _Partisan Review_, 15 (Aug. 1948), 885.
 
I'd be obliged to anyone who can point me to something that investigates
this Creeley/Stevens connection re form/content -- or more generally on
Stevens' influence on C (and/or O).

Channel-Surfing the Apocalypse
(a day in the life of the fin-de-millennium mind)
by Susan Smith Nash
 
 
/Fiction/ Women's Studies/Cultural Studies
 
Channel-Surfing the Apocalypse is a collection of outrageously funny,
poignant and insightful no-holds-barred fictions from a writer who
characterizes them as,"stories about and from women driven mad by
dysfunctional relationships." And yet, the stories are more than installations
 in the current soap-opera of
gender wars. They peel the armor off of the souls of men and women facing
the millennium and attendant apocalyptic madness. Like all fiction written
during times of universal insanity, these stories are not mad diaries.
These "furious fictions" are intensely sane and personal, and they leave
the reader with a sense of restored perspective and good humor. They appeal to
 readers who
are interested in gender issues, women's studies, experimental fiction and
cultural criticism.  Selections from the book have been awarded a Gertrude Stein
Award for Innovative Writing. A critically-commended video based on a chapter
from thebook, which features the author and her voice , is also available.
 
"Susan Smith Nash's book Channel-Surfing the Apocalypse is very
interesting. It is certainly a new approach to an area of writing. . .can I call
 it
fiction(?). You cannot read this book without paying attention. . .it demands
attention...demands a double-take. Susan Smith Nash deserves such
attention. She has created an up-to-the-minute post-AIDS statement."
                                             --William S. Burroughs
 
 
"Insistently parochial, the voice in this book is Oklahoma unalloyed. The
apocalypse arrived early here, on television, and this fertile, lyrical,
creepy, ovidian book is its detonating antiphon. Remarkable."--Diane
Middlebrook
 
"Susan Smith Nash is a reporter commissioned by the muses, a kind of
higher intensity poet-version of Christiane Amanpour, reporting live from all
the intimate and mysterious combat zone that fill our world with
terror."--Robert Kelly
 
"The works of Susan smith Nash are fireworks, with much more than flash.
They are bold, funny, and brilliant, illuminating corners of the literary
landscape that have been dark for a long time." --Beth Joselow

Hi, re - CCCP 6, in Peter's wake, not a great deal to add. I was present
for all of it but the session on magazine editing during which I drove to
Norwich to pick up a poem that David Marriott had requested (first request
I've ever done) and also listen in on some electronic treatments of weaving
machines for a forthcoming installation by Sianed Jones called 'Carthen'.
SO my editing session was perhaps more lively and enjoyable than the report
backs I got from those who stayed on in the hall.
 
However, most of the readings were pretty packed. Of those that Peter
didn't make or mention. Simon Perrill described other unnamed poets as
producing work 'paling into significance'. He read strongly as did Mas Abe
who I enjoyed most when he read in Japanese and Adrian Harding whose work I
didn't known and will certainly try to follow, there being something coming
and going there in a ruminative everyday consciousness gardening that I
want to read more closely.
 
Lisa Robertson read very confidently from 'Debbie', measured and arrowing
thickets of irony / Les Murray was unprepossessing and jovial (he had a
pretty good bat poem which went off into giggling bat language) and there
seemed to be cattle all over his writing which has left a humane trace
without setting this particular bush on fire. Ian Patterson gave us the
best Duino Elegy translation I've heard to date (I've tried to encourage
him to do the whole series and get them published, terrific work).
 
As usual in England the gremlin was a lack of places to go eating late at
night (meaning any time after 11!), so post-reading get downs tend to
degenerate into scurries round emptying streets for fast food or even worse
after last orders and the bars tip out.
 
Sunday began in the afternoon (Brian Catling, Caroline Bergvall and myself
had all protested at being expected to perform in the morning). I read
'Skin upon sKin' which will be out on CD in about 6 weeks (I know the dates
keep fading, but it's really on the way  -  backed with a version of the
recently published 'stranger'), Caroline read two fine recentish pieces
'The Hungry Form' and 'Don't Push It' whilst Brian read from 'Cyclops'
material alongside rough edits of videos from various version of that. What
can I say  -  I though we were all terrific. It's worth noting here that
many of the poets at this year's conference read from long work. In mine
and Caroline and Brian's cases the writing is versioned in various ways so
as to become 'pieces' of multi-faceted performance writing through which
aspects of peritext are frequently exploded, exploited and re-situated into
version upon version.
 
Harry Gilonis performed a generous and breath-stretching tribute to Sorley
Maclean using pibroche (basically bagpipe form) musical constraints
effectively (I'm looking forward to the simultaneous English-Gaelic version
Harry if you're here). Rod Dickinson is a poet well worth checking out for
those who don't already know his work. Brilliant sonic elision's using
Gaelic to punch exquisite interferent holes into the scope of his writing.
The glosses also being cogent.
 
Finally we had a strange (for me) mixture of Kelvin Corcoran (who's just
not a confident presenter of his own work  - you know, oh-oh, I really
think that there shouldn't be any expectation on poets to have to read or
to be able to read. I know it's a way of getting around and so on (and some
awkwardnesses can be utterly compelling, but . . . any thoughts anyone?),
Alan Halsey who chose, a misjudgement in my opinion, to read Robin Hood
stories. The grouping was lifted by Pascal Monnier who sounded intriguingly
elliptoid and discursive, through my so-so French (so I'm probably
completely wrong  -  those might just be the features of my processing) and
I could have listened for longer than she was given.
 
But a good conference all in all.
 
love and love

Hi Mark, well mm yes. I was never in it but Kris was based in Britain where
the magazine first emerged before he split for Australia in the mid 1970s.
Other s here might be able to tell you more. I think its follow up magazine
was named 'the merry creek or nero' (?) of which I've got a copy somewhere,
but don't expect me to put a quick hand onto it. Kris was editing here at
the same time as the extraordinary Fluxshoe series / Paul Buck's excellent
'Curtains' / Allen Fisher's 'Spanner' (still in progress and about to go
net versions) / Pierre Joris' 'Sixpack' / Elaine Randall's 'Amazing Grace'.
 Hey're all well worth checking out. STill exceptionally vibrant work  -
in my humble estimation. Is Kris still active?

perhaps peotics has been taken up into poetry the way testicles are taken up
into the martial artist.  It is an activity which requires much learning and
dicipline but ultimately is a defensive posture based on a peculiar idea of
conservation, and from where not much productive can be done.
 
 
Thanks to Ward for the bicameral quote because we always need more ways to
think about the configurations of experience and imagination with structure,
but again I feel this book is a story, or description of how Discourse
interprets and sets up a model for understanding, and then tells it to
itself.  Lyotard's "The Differend" is useful here in remembering that "A
Wrong results from the fact that the rules of the genre of discourse by
which one judges are not those of the judged genre or genres of discourse"
and states the problem as "the absence of a universal genre of discourse to
regulate...,  to find, if not what can legimate judgement, the "good"
linkage, then at least how to save the honor of thinking".  He is using the
legal language (the Wrong) which is a bit blown up but the point that the
terms of regimes of thought developed in discours of language with mind
brain or body are different and suffer from transportation/translation.
 
Texts which tell most in these matters I think are those which do not
necessarily speak of this issue, but issue from the places we have been
discussing.  the extreme examples are perhaps best:
Writing from the brain, from an organ which organizes, interprets,
reticularly activtes, but also produes sounds, light and images inside
itself,observed and then set down in writing,  would be Pantanjali.
 
Writing from the body, even from impossible places that require bodily
knowledge would be perhaps Franz Kamin's "Srcibble Death".
 
And Writing from a moment of crystalline indecision constructed from the
infintie possibilities of both would be the romantic moment, perhaps most
easily, Coleridge.

I take it this is a "slight".  I'm not sure where it's issuing FROM, but I
see what it's writing TO: the solar plexus.  Nevertheless, I don't think
Jondi at least in this post has addressed my previous remark: that the
idea that writing issues "from" some particular psycho-organic place
- whatever the new thrills of intellectual exploration it may seem to
provide - is already structured on some kind of unstated grid which, like
Descartes, divides body from mind.  My point was that poetry takes as its
domain the "body" of the universe, and poetics is the study of what poetry
makes of it.  Poetry might include toe-talk and martial arts, but toe-
talkology will not replace poetics in that field.  The "talk" of the body
might be included in all the repressed or missed sensations which poetry
tries to bring to light, but once body starts talking in language it's
already entered the sphere of poetics. - Henry Gould

dear billiam:
 
nice to see you on the list!  thanks for tracing down the form/content
quote.  wrt stevens' influence on creeley, see the spring '93 special
issue of _the wallace stevens journal_, which contains an interesting
short piece by creeley called "in respect of wallace stevens" (it begins:
"i recall being very intent upon stevens in college days") as well as
responses to stevens by the likes of kathleen fraser, bob perelman,
charles bernstein, and many others.
 
not sure what olson thought of wally, though i'd be curious to find
out.

        I hear you say: "All that is not *fact*; it is poetry."
        Nonsense!  Bad poetry is false, I grant, but nothing is truer
        than true poetry.  And let me tell the scientific men that
        the artists are much finer and more accurate observers than

Another anthology of interest for anyone pursuing questions of page design: L.

of the century, as you'd expect from the title, non-English language with
facing translations.
 
Bill Marsh: on Stevens and Creeley--Albert Gelpi edited an essay collection
some years ago, *Wallace Stevens: The Poetics of Modernism* (Cambridge, 1985),
in which Michael Davidson and I both have essays that touch on the
Stevens-Creeley connection in passing without pursuing in depth. Still, you
might find the general context of the essays relevant to your questions.
Michael's piece is on Stevens and contemporary poetics, mine is on
intersections between the allegedly opposed (or so they tended to be seen
then) Stevens and Objectivist lines, via a discussion of WS and Zukofsky
(something on which our listmate, Mark Scroggins, has done more recent and
fine work).

     Ernst Van Alphen, thats it, thanks.
     From my understanding, this thread was not only asking about cubism,
     concrete poetry and the like, but also about transferrence between the
     visual experience and its subsequent translation onto the page. This
     residue of activity apparent in the finished product is freshly
     captured within the Alphen book. This text also seques into the "body"
     thread, for Bacon believed the human body was in a sense a filter,
     apart from its other attributes, abbreviating experience into
     intensity.

New from Avec Books
_Channel-Surfing the Apocalypse_
(a day in the life of the fin-de-millennium mind)
by Susan Smith Nash
 
 
/Fiction/ Women's Studies/Cultural Studies
 
_Channel-Surfing the Apocalypse_ is a collection of outrageously funny,
poignant and insightful no-holds-barred fictions from a writer who
characterizes them as,"stories about and from women driven mad by
dysfunctional relationships." And yet, the stories are more than
installations in the current soap-opera of gender wars. They peel
the armor off of the souls of men and women facing the millennium
and attendant apocalyptic madness. Like all fiction written
during times of universal insanity, these stories are not mad diaries.
These "furious fictions" are intensely sane and personal, and they leave
the reader with a sense of restored perspective and good humor. They appeal
to readers who are interested in gender issues, women's studies,
experimental fiction and cultural criticism.  Selections from the book
have been awarded a Gertrude Stein Award for Innovative Writing. A
critically-commended video based on a chapter from the book, which
features the author and her voice , is also available.
 
"Susan Smith Nash's book Channel-Surfing the Apocalypse is very
interesting. It is certainly a new approach to an area of writing. . .
can I call it fiction(?). You cannot read this book without paying
attention. . .it demands attention...demands a double-take. Susan
Smith Nash deserves such attention. She has created an up-to-the-minute
post-AIDS statement."
                                             --William S. Burroughs
 
 
"Insistently parochial, the voice in this book is Oklahoma unalloyed. The
apocalypse arrived early here, on television, and thi fertile, lyrical,
creepy, ovidian book is its detonating antiphon. Remarkable."
                                             --Diane Middlebrook
 
"Susan Smith Nash is a reporter commissioned by the muses, a kind of
higher intensity poet-version of Christiane Amanpour, reporting live from all
the intimate and mysterious combat zone that fill our world with
terror."                                     --Robert Kelly
 
"The works of Susan smith Nash are fireworks, with much more than flash.
They are bold, funny, and brilliant, illuminating corners of the literary
landscape that have been dark for a long time."
                                             --Beth Joselow

Last week while at the Beckett conference I couldnt do number two. I sat
there and sat there, saying "I can't go. I'll go." Only when I got home did
I go out to compost the garden , squatted there for a while, and moved
around, managing to spell out three longish words. Is that called writing
through the body?

Though I missed his reading, I can confirm cris's impression that
Adrian Harding is someone to look out for. I picked up some of his
work at the event, and (assuming it's the same person) I have been
reading a fascinating essay by him on  "Melancholy and Technology", a
welcome break from too much cyberspace euphoria. As for cris's
comments on confidence and performance, there does too often seem to
be a general space of sag from which poets offer themselves. The
performable aspect of any poem ought to make more of a difference to
that predicament than it does. There may be more UK sag than US.

Subject:      USOP
 
Aldon, thanks for USOP commentary few days back.  More expansive  is what you
seek, and I m certainly with you there, whether in the Olsonian or simply in
more varied poetics. Mandate for USOP was a geographic, cultural AND
aesthetic landscape exploration, not only for the series but each half-hour
segment, and in that order. The  themes  of the shows also dictated,
considerably, the pool of poems. Much of the more expansive poetry is not
 about  anything.  The final show ( The Word) allowed for some, with Carla H,
Eigner, and Creeley. Tried hard for a Susan Howe piece... among others.
Maureen Owen was to be in a sixth show, cut for funds (she s in the Abrams
book.)
 
Carter, far from being elder statesman of poetry, is in the series, to me, an
Everypoet. Hey, if Jimmy can do it etc. I do like his poem, one of several in
his _Always a Reckoning_ with an ironic fillip that pushes off his
sentimentality.
 
As for Barbara Kruger ( always nice to give Barbara Kruger even more credits
than she already has ), her propaganda verbiage was art analogue for director
Mark Pellington -- his videoizaton of her pieces, did it make them more/less
 poems ?, is a question. As for implication that this should have been more
 alternative  -- poetry itself is so alternative, marginalized, that we
needed all the name recognition we could find to get whatever attention we
did get. As I ve mentioned, PBS itself refused to broadcast nationally,
shying away from content, and only half the stations nationwide have aired
the series so far. Kruger (and Jenny Holzer, from show 5 again), in a poetry
show, are they now poets? where does TV end and art/design/poem begin? Or is
video simply a means of transmission of the poem? It gave a luster, too, and
they gave spirited collaborative energy, not to be discounted. Our original
idea of having various directors, allowing the curent vidPo makers to
participate was nixed by ITVS, our funder: they felt strongly that it would
take a single director to pull the porject together.
 
The McCann/Harris reference ( Try to make it Real/Compared to what ) is most
applicable -- it was the theme song for the WNYC-TV series  poetry Spots  I
produced for six seasons.
 
I m with you for more expansive future editions. Write/call your PBS stations
and ask for them to show/repeat USOP. Or just bug em for more po. Current
plans at washington Square Films are to produce single poem videos with
director/poet collaborating, then form shows later. The floor is open for
backchannel nominations.
 
FYI:
Josh Blum, the other producer of USOP, and I will be on the Hot Seat at Steve
Cannon s Tribes Gallery, 285 E. 3rd (C-D) in NYC on Sun, May 19, 5-7. A
benefit for Steve s gathering of the Tribes mag, we ll show various segments
and get assassinated by the audience. As Ashbery says,  Purists will object.

   Bob H.---I did see the first three USOP shows. I tended to like the second
   and third ones better than the first. Perhaps this is because I became
   used to the format by the second show, but also that there was more of
   the urban poetry of protest in the second and third segments and seemed
   to be less of the country stuff (Okay, I must acknowledge my subjective
   biases here). I kept thinking "wow, what is going on in the minds of the
   country folk when they hear these city folk" because the "value systems"
   are so different, but then I shouldn't be a city snob (especially considering
   I haven't lived in a city now for 4 years). Anyway, no point repeating
   the critiques of lack of variety others have made. I did watch it with
   two ex-students of mine and they dug it (though not as much as POETRY IN MOTION ) I wish there would have been more of LORD BUCKLEY. My students really
   liked Matt Cook. Leonard Cohen was a surprise, as was Thylias Moss (i
   would have expected less of a slammy type voice from her). John Wright's
   Bob_Newhart deadpan delivery was interesting. The money channel graphics
    were interesting. "tumbling like love through a rich man's fingers"
    "i'm stubborn as the garbage bags time cannot decay"....
    PINA's poem which said the opposite in english of what it said in
    spanish too.  Jim Northrop's thing about the shrink commiting suicide...
    even Dennis Cooper---"SO BORED THEY BEG TO BE BEATEN" and the poem
    about the IT'S SO HOT TODAY, and the two poems about wanting to wake
    up at what tom waits would call "the crack of noon"....I didn't much
     care for the poet who wrote about stealing her sister's fattening food
     though..... Looking forward to parts 4 and 5. Chris S.

That is amazing but not surprising, eh? Only time I met Bill Manhire was
when my friend Tony Bellette took me to meet him for lunch somewhere
upstairs in Wellington. Bill wasnt singing. He wasnt talking, either. It
was explained to me that he often sits silently. I like his poetry fairly
well, though, and was glad to meet him. At the time I was trying to get
over hearing an hour of Sam Hunt performing his verses.

Another reply to John Knapp.  May I point out that the word "constructivist"
is, I think, being used in two ways?  John is using it to summarize the
position often heard in litry circles these days, that we are "constructed"
by our culture.  Leo Goldberger is pointing to its psychological usage,
which he explains.  --Best, Norm
----------------------------Original message----------------------------
But are there, indeed, folks out there who assert or believe that the
constructivist perspective is sufficient onto itself?
 
There is, after all, the realm of "facticity" (including the biological
as well as the geographical) which, at least, must
serve as a starting point for any interpretive "construction".
 
At issue is meaning making: what we as cultural creatures "make" out of
a given set of facts, within a given set of contexts-- be the facts
"temperament", "height", or an earthquaque.
 
 
This discussion reminds me a bit of the old debate in academic psychology
between the traditional "pure perception" theorists vs. the "new look"
writers on perception. The latter researchers had discovered that needs
and motives can influence even the most elementary aspects of perception,
including size judgment, thus casting some doubt on the "veridical"
"autochtonous" factors of the pure perceptionist. For example a hungry
subject was more inclined to overestimate the size of a dime than a sated
subject. Of courses the kicker in all of this was that the variation
around the actual (factual) size as measured by a standardized ruler was
quite limnited. There was a range of invariance, in other words, within
which subjective, interpretive factors held sway (not large enough to
really create problems with the notion of "reality contact".

Aldon Nielsen asked re: Sappho quotation at beginning of Theresa Hak Kyung
Cha's DICTEE:

>_Dictee_;  Nothing in this book should be taken at "face" value
 
ALDON, read what I said in the very next sentence of my message!! that "On
the other hand ... the Sappho quotation is faked".  Back in 1991, I spent
days trying to track down a Sappho fragment that might even begin to resemble
the "quotation" and couldn't find anything. Maybe someone out there with good
classical training will have better luck...please inform us when you do. The
lines in the DICTEE epigraph are:
"May I write words more naked than flesh,
stronger than bone, more resilient than
sinew, sensitive than nerve."
 
NOTE: Prof. Shelley Sunn Wong in her essay on DICTEE thanks a Cornell U.
sophomore for informing her that the Sappho epigraph is apocryphal.  That
student had been in the Asian American literature course I taught as a
visiting lecturer at Cornell the year before, didn't know Sappho from Harpo,
and got the information from one of my lectures.  Maybe it was just a
statement made to Shelley with no intention of brown-nosing appropriation,
but MAYBE it is related to the fact that when I returned to campus the next
year for a visit she didn't return my greeting when I saw her by coincidence
as she passed me on a stairway.  "Oh," I added earnestly and in haste (there
was quite a crowd of students going by), "I began to write a letter back [to
the friendly letter she'd sent me during summer vacation], but I never got
around to finishing and sending it off!" "Yeah, SURE!" she crackled and just
went down to the next floor.  Jeez, I really had meant to finish it...

The PHIL-LIT/_Philosophy and Literature_ Bad Writing Contest:
Results for round two.
 
The entries for the second run of the Bad Writing Contest have now
been tabulated, and we are pleased to announce winners.  But first a
few tedious words.  There is no question that we have better--if that's
how to put it--entries than the last time we ran the contest.  Some of
the entries are stunning, and we think almost all of them deserve a
prize of some sort.
 
This is not to say that much of the writing we would consider "bad" is
necessarily incompetent.  Graduate students and young scholars
please note: many of the writers represented have worked years to
attain their styles and they have been rewarded with publication in
books and journal articles.  In fact, if they weren't published, we
wouldn't have them for our contest.  That these passages constitute
bad writing is merely our opinion; it is arguable that for anyone
wanting to pursue an academic career should assiduously imitate
such styles as are represented here.  These are you role models.
 
First prize goes to David Spurrett of the University of Natal in South
Africa.  He found this marvelous sentence--yes, it's but one
sentence--from Roy Bhaskar's _Plato etc: The Problems of Philosophy
and Their Resolution_ (Verso, 1994): "Indeed dialectical critical
realism may be seen under the aspect of Foucauldian strategic
reversal--of the unholy trinity of Parmenidean/Platonic/Aristotelean
provenance; of the Cartesian-Lockean-Humean-Kantian paradigm,
of foundationalisms (in practice, fideistic foundationalisms) and
irrationalisms (in practice, capricious exercises of the will-to-power
or some other ideologically and/or psycho-somatically buried source)
new and old  alike; of the primordial failing of western philosophy,
ontological monovalence, and its close ally, the epistemic fallacy with
its ontic dual; of the analytic problematic laid down by Plato, which
Hegel served only to replicate in his actualist monovalent analytic
reinstatement in transfigurative reconciling dialectical connection,
while in his hubristic claims for absolute idealism he inaugurated the
Comtean, Kierkegaardian and Nietzschean eclipses of reason,
replicating the fundaments of positivism through its transmutation
route to the superidealism of a Baudrillard."  It's a splendid bit of
prose and I'm certain many of us will now attempt to read it aloud
without taking a breath.  The jacket blurb, incidentally, informs us
that this is the author's "most accessible book to date."
 
Second Prize is won by Jennifer Harris of the University of Toronto.
She found a grand sentence in an essay by Stephen T. Tyman called
"Ricoeur and the Problem of Evil," in _The Philosophy of Paul
Ricoeur_, edited, it says, by Lewis Edwin Hahn (Open Court, 1995):
"With the last gasp of Romanticism, the quelling of its florid uprising
against the vapid formalism of one strain of the Enlightenment, the
dimming of its yearning for the imagined grandeur of the archaic,
and the dashing of its too sanguine hopes for a revitalized, fulfilled
humanity, the horror of its more lasting, more Gothic legacy has
settled in, distributed and diffused enough, to be sure, that
lugubriousness is recognizable only as languor, or as a certain
sardonic laconicism disguising itself in a new sanctification of the
destructive instincts, a new genius for displacing cultural reifications
in the interminable shell game of the analysis of the human psyche,
where nothing remains sacred."  Speaking of shell games, see if you
can figure out the subject of that sentence.
 
Third prize was such a problem that we decided to award more than
one.  Exactly what the prizes will be is uncertain (the first three prizes
were to be books), but something nice will be found.  (Perhaps: third
prize, an old copy of _Glyph_; fourth prize two old copies of
_Glyph_.)
 
Jack Kolb of UCLA found this sentence in Paul Fry's _A Defense of
Poetry_ (Stanford University Press, 1995).  Together with the
previous winners, it proves that 1995 was to bad prose what 1685 was
to good music.  Fry writes, "It is the moment of non-construction,
disclosing the absentation of actuality from the concept in part
through its invitation to emphasize, in reading, the
helplessness--rather than the will to power--of its fall into
conceptuality."  Incidentally, Kolb is reviewing Fry's book for
_Philosophy and Literature_, and believe it or not he generally
respects it.
 
Arthur J. Weitzman of Northeastern University has noted for us two
helpful sentences from _The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory
and Criticism_, edited by Michael Groden and Martin Kreiswirth
(JHUP, 1994).  It is from Donald E. Pease's entry on Harold Bloom:
"Previous exercises in influence study depended upon a topographical
model of reallocatable poetic images, distributed more or less equally
within 'canonical' poems, each part of which expressively totalized
the entelechy of the entire tradition.  But Bloom now understood this
cognitive map of interchangeable organic wholes to be criticism's
repression of poetry's will to overcome time's anteriority."  What can
we add to that?
 
William Dolphin of San Francisco State University located for us this
elegant sentence in John Guillory's _Cultural Capital: The Problem of
Literary Canon Formation_ (University of Chicago Press, 1993): "A
politics presuming the ontological indifference of all minority social
identities as defining oppressed or dominated groups, a politics in
which differences are sublimated in the constitution of a minority
identity (the identity politics which is increasingly being questioned
within feminism itself) can recover the differences between social
identities only on the basis of common and therefore commensurable
experiences of marginalization, which experiences in turn yield a
political practice that consists largely of _affirming_ the identities
specific to those experiences."
 
And speaking of marginalization, where, you may ask, are women in
this?  Aren't we being exclusionary?  Indeed, it's frankly unfair that
men should have all the fun, but the gallant Canadian David Savory
found this lucid sentence in the essay "Tonya's Bad Boot," in _Women
on Ice_, edited by Cynthia Baughman: "This melodrama parsed the
transgressive hybridity of un-narrativized representative bodies back
into recognizable heterovisual codes."
 
Thanks to these and all the other entrants.  If you didn't this time, the
next round of the Bad Writing Contest, prizes to be announced, is
now open with a deadline of September 30, 1996.  So you've plenty of
time to find examples from the turgid new world of academic prose.
Details of the new contest will appear on PHIL-LIT.  Winners of this
contest, watch for your prizes in the mail.
 
Thanks to all.

Subject:      Re: creeley quote
 
I wonder if anything has been done relating philosopher CS Peirce &
poetry.  There's the semiotics, but I don't think Peirce himself wrote
much about aesthetics per se. I think his trichotomy theory - "First,
Second & Thirdness" - was meant in part to be an advance and revision
on the "form/matter" distinctions of scholasticism, of which these
mantras in US poetics about form/content are like an echo.  It would
be interesting to see an application of the trichotomy (feeling,
actuality and law is a rough reduction) to poetry.  Also, maybe a
dose of Peirce's medieval/scientific realism (very roughly, "universals
and general ideas are REAL and affect life from the FUTURE although
they don't have ACTUALITY yet they can be experimentally TESTED and
be PREDICTIVE") might throw a wrench in the pervasive (what he
might call) "nominalism" of the age (i.e. reality is a phantom of
human naming-systems predicated on the non-identity of the self
and technologies of power & desire).  A consequence of Peirce's
scientific approach is that what-we-don't-know and what-we-don't-
name is nevertheless REAL - there is a real un-named out-there
which corresponds, in a way, to silence.  Silence frames things
and makes it possible to talk about actualities (i.e. for example
poems as entities, gestalts, something to be considered in-itself).
Sounds kinda new critical doesn't it?  Better put on my boxer
shorts & get ready for body language... - Henry Gould

A poem is never more than the gap between its form and its content.

hi walter, couldn't help but be amused by your anecdote abt seeing a
sophomore thanked for your idea in a colleague's paper.  as a prof i've often
observed, and had the experience myself as a student back when, that students
don't realize that what they're learning is someone's intellectual property
that's being shared. they think they're learning facts that are common
knowledge once they've learned them.  i've had students who've complained of
not learning anything in my class quote my lectures word for word in their
own papers, unattributed of course, because they don't remember/realize that
these were my ideas and sentences --to them, these insights are part of their
intellectual environment and free for the taking and reproducing.  it's
curious.  sometimes, also, i want students to credit each other in their
papers, when they use th einsights from someone else's class presentation,
for example, only to be faced with their objection that this "was not (that
other student's) idea; this is something that emerged in class discussion"
and hence common property.  in general, that's just  the way it is, i guess.
 in college i used to think that the relationship between language and desire
was my pet thing; i was piqued to find out kristeva had written a whole book
about it!  of course, i was imbibing the critical concerns of my era, my
teachers, etc, who were reading kristeva!  interesting, isnt it, the concept
of intellectual property and proper credit.  interesting and a bit
embarrassing, to be forced to be so proprietary about thoughts, which we also
know are shared and communally constructed/generated.

Subject:      Mandatory anouncement
 
As required by the welcome message of this here e-mail discussion list &
general custom, I must let you know that the book and CD-ROM version of
Microsoft's Internet Directory 96 is now out.
 
I worked on about 5% of it ( a little less than 200 reviews out of about
4,000).  Some of these are obvious (most of the music section), some are
not (consumer information & agriculture/gardening).  All the reviews (not
just mine) reflect problems of writing too quickly & corporate copy
editing, so don't go looking for too much intentional poetry here.  Still,
in the cursory glance I've given it (I haven't received my copy yet, 'cause
the Mac CD-ROM version isn't ready yet) it seems as if it's at least as
good as most of the other print directories I've seen.  I mean, the URLs
seem to have been proofread & some of them are interesting.
 
There'll be a web site with updates & new listings.  When stuff gets up
there (& the search engine works) I'll post the URL.
 
For the updates I'm doing a wider range of topics, most arts, though NOT
literature, so if you have web sites they'd like to suggest I'd love to see
them.  I can't guarantee (despite the obvious idiosyncracies of the music
section, a special case that I won't go into here) that they'll get into
the next book, but I'd love any suggestions you have on visual and/or
performing arts websites, e-mail lists, newsgroups, etc.  Back channel is
probably best for these suggestions.
 
Unlike most such messages to the list, I offer no cheap deals on the book.
I'm not sure I'd even recommend it to most of you.  It is part of the
Microsoft Bookshelf 96-97 package, though, so if you or your
office/institution buy that, you'll have it anyway.  Hoo-hah.

Oh, yeah.  As I said, I didn't write the literary sections of the Microsoft
Internet guide.
 
So don't blame me for the reviews of EPC or POETICS-LIST in the Microsoft
book, which includes and then tells how to sign up to receive Rif/t as if
this'll get you onto POETICS.  (Hasn't this happened before a few times?)
 
I'll send a message to the editor (& the reviewer) that the list is closed
& shouldn't be reviewed anyway & that what is in the book is incorrect.
 
Though, judging from what just came over the net from Mr Sherwood re:
E-POETRY-L, maybe I shouldn't bother.
 
Besides, anyone digging around the POETICS-L archive at EPC (besides seeing
all of our deathless prose, stupid jokes, & rare poetry) could find out how
to subscribe easily enough.

maria, I was interested in your observation that students tend to
consider what they are taught as common property, generally accepted
facts, rather than an individual professor's intellectual property. when
I was a student I very definitely thought that what my professors were
telling me was their own opinion, not necessarily fact and certainly not
what another professor of the same subject would tell me.  In fact, I
remember the moment (in a graduate seminar, so it took quite a while for
me to reach this point) when I realized that what they guy was saying was
probably not just his opinion, but the way it really was, or rather the
way that anyone who knew anything about the subject agreed that it was.
 
whether this attitude was personal (those who know me personally can say)
or more characteristic of the early 70s, I know I was very resistant to
the idea that my teachers, simply by virtue of being teachers, had any
privileged access to truth.  if I was impressed by them, as individuals,
I tended to take what they said more seriously.  this attitude probably
limited somewhat the benefit I could have derived from my extensive
education, and is no doubt one reason I eventually did leave academics.
however, since I did later later come to think of it as an adolescent
attitude, I am surprised to hear that it is not close to universal among
college students.

I wanted also to elaborate on the *New* EPC home page. As presently
constituted, it contains five images, three large and two small. The three
large images, if clicked, lead to "Hotlist" (recently added and recommended
slots in the EPC), "Feature" (a direct connection to a truly hot new EPC
resource), the EPC banner (leads to our full home page), a tiny box which
reads "Net" (leads to a recommended outside link - at present to the
remarkable Net space of the Swedish performance poetry group, Skin to Skin
"...Skin to Skin work with the new underground expressions which are growing
stronger throughout Europe - a mixture of tribal rites, science fiction,
performance and 'no borders' multimedia...raw, simple and uncensored...
...this is good: tight, concentrated, merciless shock at a hard pulsing

performances/interviews housed at the EPC. "Feature" and "Net" will be
changed often, offering you some quality stuff.

Subject:      Re: beckett
 
>   Dear George Bowering---
>    tell me more about BECKETT, please! (cs)
 
The festival was hosted by the University of Victoria Theatre Dept., which
is one of the best theatre departments in the country, so the papers that
were delivered were all about the plays, often about the production of
them. There was one paper on _Malloy_, but I missed it because i was at
another session of three papers on Billie Whitelaw, and I love Billie
Whitelaw. I cant remember any of the papers I was thrilled by. Apparently
the Fred Neumann address given the night before the festival got really
going was really good. In fact, there was an earthquake (5.3 on the
Richter, epicentre in Sedro Wooley, Wash.) in the middle of it. Contorski's
keynote address (one hr.) was friendly and engaging and scholarly, and he
had a Sam Beckett haircut and trousers too short, a weird homage. There
were a lot of Beckett scholars there from Florida, others from the
souteast, as well as places like Kansas and Montreal and South Dakota.
 
But the productions (good lord, so many of them) were a lot more
interesting. There were a few clunkers, but mostly pretty good stuff, and
sometimes 2 productions of the same play. I was disappointed that no one
did _Ohio Impromptu_. There was a company that offered it, but they didnt
make the final cut as far as the selection people went. So.
 
Every morning there was a room in which the radio plays were broadcast, and
a room in which the videos were shown. After waiting all these years I
finally saw "Film" and it is still wonderful. It provided one of the
instances in which you notice emblems passing from item to item. For
instance, Buster Keaton's handkerchief under his trademark porkpie hat
shoes up again on Willie in _Happy Days_ as handkerchief under straw
boater. The first plays on stage (there were two theatres, the regular
stage and the proscenium stage) were done by the Goetheanum-Buhne Players
of Switzerland, the people from the Rudolf Steiner institute. They did _Not
I_ in German, which is interesting, as Mouth sounds more forceful, less
frantic in that language. Their "Footfalls" looked beautiful, the woman in
real Beckett rags with her one arm out in front of her, palm up. Their
"Catastrophe" was excellent, buit it is not a hard play to do, except for
the victim's posture. They did "Play" and did it well, though as you can
imagine, the speed kept you from picking up the fast talk with a slight
German accent. The person doing the light was actually almost a character.
You could see her operating.
 
That night the troupe from SUNY New Paltz did "Quad I and II", really fast,
with beautiful shiny cloaks and cowls, in red and white and blue and gold,
except at the end, when they were all white. Fast and with good music. I
loved it, having sat back in the last row. Then in the proscenium theatre
the Pantechnicon Theatre from Pomona did "Footfalls". This was pretty bad,
with a too-young woman doing it, her steps noty always 9 paces, etc. And
she was wearing her wedding ring! Then their guy did "Piece of Monologue"
pretty well. Then their older woman did "Not I"--her speech was perfectly
clear and theatrically adept, but she chose to do it slowly, which might be
pleasant but isnt Beckett.
 
Next afternoon. Fred Neumann did his adaptation of "Worstward Ho." He is in
a grave with a skeleton and all; now Beckett gave him this, and no one else
has the nerve to do it. It was terrific. for me the highlight of the
festival, though I was knocked out by the new Palts "Quad." Then pone had
to make a choice between "Catastrophe" done by the University of british
Columbia players plus "Krapp's Last Tape" done by University of
Victoria---or Happy Days done by Colorado State Univ. I went to the latter
because I hadnt seen it for so long. It was pretty good, cant remember the
actors' names. Then an hour later I saw "Krapp's Last Tape" played by a
woman who represented Dickinson College and the Jean Cocteau Rep. from NY.
She is the daughter of the guy who did it an hour earlier. She played it as
a man, whole script, etc., but the voice on tape was a woman's. Interesting
genderbending. Sam wouldnt have approved. Semiotically puzzling, but let us
say, effective. I wasnt pissed off purist Beckettian. I dug it. And now my
body and brain were calling out for endless beckett. So two hours for
dinner, and then we saw university of Victoria do "Act Without Words II"
pretty well, and then the Pantechnicon people again. Now thwir guy does a
stage adaptation of "Company," an 80-minute monolgue (some on tape), and it
was a bravura perfgormance, very touching. Then the woman did "Rockabye",
and that was pretty good too. This company works with a modular adjustable
set that they bring on a truck on tour, all hinges and stuff. It works.
 
Next day, Sunday. The famous Neptune Theatre from Halifax, and their young
comedy troupe called Jest in Time, do a set on the reg. stage. They are, I
think, all gay, three women and one man. They do "Play" creditably, nice
and fast. Makeup isnt as interesting as the Swiss one. They do "Come and
Go." They do "Rough for Theatre I" cross-dressed, and funny. They do
"Quad", a short pre-German one, in brown and with thinner music and with
three short people and one tall; it just didnt look or sound anywhere as
good as the SUNY one. They do a well-timed "What Where" and I at last
understand the mathematics and geometrics, having only "read" it. They they
do "Nacht und Traume," which I have never seen, and it is a hurt, so
beautiful; so close to Beckettian sentimentality, so well lit, a real
theatre moment. Words fail me.
 
I head for the bathroom. I cant go on. I went on.
 
To the other theatre, where the festival was ended with a production of
"Breath", also done by the Jean Cocteau Rep. People fell out. Folks
applauded a stage with no one on it.
 
On the way home to Vancouver I contemplated jumping off the ferry. But I
fell asleep, right beside the kids' play room.
 
You should have been there. You wdnt haVE HAD TO        GET by with my
subjective words.
 
Federman shd have been there.

Well, the papers on Whitelaw were pretty well noncritical, ranging from
gossipy to comparative.
 
But you are in luck. In 1995 her autobiography was published. It is called
_Billie Whitelaw" Who He?_
 
She shows up in movies from time to time, usually things that are deemed
not international enough to be seen over here. But there is a kind of
filmography in the autobiography.
 
I'll give you the addresses of the three people who did papers:
 
Dr. Stephen Dilks, University of North Dakota (I think). He is an Englishman.
 
Dr. Malcolm Page, English Dept., Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C.,
V5A 1S6, Canada. (He writes a lot about modern English drama, but not very
critically)
 
Dr. Eric Prince. He is a director but I dont know his Univ. affiliation. He
was listed as from Scarborough, England.

I know (from lurking) that people on the list are generally (understandably)
hesitant to play the "define a movement" game, but I heard someone recently
define language poetry as "that school of poetics which most consciously and
critically engages language as ideology."  While this struck me as somewhat
reductive, I had a hard time formulating a response to highlight the
short-comings of the definition, and thought I might throw it out here for

A few thoughts in response to Maria's comments about students' expectations:
 
Many students and professionals pursuing professional growth seems wrapped
and rapt by the information-as-commodity syndrome.  This pattern seems to
provide its own natural tiers of progression, and to offer a sense that one
is "getting somewhere" and, in addition, "gaining something."
 
Regardless of the truth of this pantomime, I look upon it both gently and
wryly, I guess.  Sometimes it's frustrating to see rat-in-maze behaviors
when this behavior  seems in conflict with engagement.
 
The way that I've bridged these two is by creating VERY structured exercises
that provide for the drawing out of analytical and/or integrative thought.
While group process used to be mysterious to me, it's now second nature.
And I love it.  But STRUCTURE has been the point of rescue on all of this.
 
Sometimes I have difficulty believing the fervor with which I see people
taking notes when I offer some linear list.  It's like a feeding frenzy.
But my sympathies remain in place, as I know how they participants have been
programmed.

We've had declarations that poetics is not primarily concerned with poetry,
and now we have a practice in poetry defined as a school of poetics. This is
what troubles me about this definition, even though I am not one to divorce
poetry from poetics, nor am I one to inextricably link the two. But in
specifically describing a poetry practice as a school which critically
engages language as ideology, this definition seems to make secondary
elements which I find most attractive about language poetry, which is the
foregrounding of poetry as language at play. Any definition of language
poetry which can succeed in including the playful use (& I would argue that
play is absolutely useful; I would also argue that it is ideological, but
not that ideology is the primary intent) of language in Gertrude Stein,
bpNichol, and Charles Bernstein, would gain my confidence. While one can
choose to look at all three of these in terms of critically & consciously
engaging language as ideology, I don't think this is by any means the only
lens one needs to illuminate primary aspects of the work. And I choose these
three writers only because of their diversity and their rather obvious joy
in creating language works.

as "The Chinchulines" and formally known as "Youth Group" with
ties to the PRI, and indigenous from the Ejido San Jeronimo.
 
This paramilitary group assaulted about 300 indigenous men
and women last night, as they made their way home after a
communal assembly in San Jeronimo where the paramilitary group
lost communal elections.
 
This paramilitary group took over the municipality of Chilon
(a few miles from Bachajon) about 14 days ago and has kept the
civilians and human rights workers under constant verbal abuse
and threats of violence.
 
Neither the State nor Federal authorities have intervened in
stopping the violent actions of this paramilitary group.
 
At the present time, we have the confirmation of at least
one person dead and many injured. Heavily armed men have been
seen traveling by pick up truck from Chilon to Bachajon.
 
There is an unconfirmed report that the Church in Bachajon
belonging to the Jesuit Mission has been set on fire, we are
presently trying to confirm this but are unable to reach anyone
to do so.
 
This is but one more sign of the decomposition of the system
and the growing activity of the paramilitary groups in Chiapas.
If this local conflict does not have a quick political solution
it can place the Peace Dialogue in jeopardy.
 
This would mean a new threat of a violent confrontation at a
larger scale.
 
On the other hand, the Mexican Press reports today that a
vehicle belonging to MIlitary Intelligence and the Public
Security, has been following Bishop Ruiz all week very closely
and remains outside his residence.
 
We ask ourselves what are really the intentions of the
Mexican government?
 
We encourage you to send faxes to President Zedillo asking
him to intervene BRINGING ABOUT A POLITICAL SOLUTION THAT FAVORS
THE CONTINUITY OF THE PEACE TALKS.

This would correspond (since no one else is taking me up on this thread)
with CS Peirce's category of "firstness", to which he attached aesthetics
(the "admirable in itself") in general - feeling, quality, randomness,
the unrelated pure exploding variety of nature. - H. Gould

Does anyone know of a Rumanian/American writer by the name
of Peter Neagoe? I read a short story by him, published
in _transition_ magazine and believe he published several books
of short stories, poetry, prose, and translations.
 
I would like to find out if there are any books in print by
him, about him, or about the Surrealist activities in which
(I believe) he was involved.
 
Anyone know any answers? Just respond to the list or e-mail

The poem is about, Aldon, but the poetry is not, is what I think I mean. And
that is the Olson expansive. As to expanding to further, as in exploding

    to be about or not to be about
    -------
    I don't think Bob was saying that
    poems that aren't ABOUT something don't have any meaning....
    but what he meant by ABOUT was a very particular kind of "aboutness"
    ______
    It can't be "about" things like "consciousness" or "words"
    as much as rootedness, in place or ethnic identity, and there
    must be some kind of thematic consistency, PIN DOWNable....
    easily.......
    ______
    though pop songs are sometimes more of a challenge
    than wild "out there" "free improv....."

When did the term "L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E" poet vs. "language" poet drop out of
use? with the demise of the original L=, or just because people got tired
of typing equals signs, or what? Institutional laziness on the part of
academicians who couldn't be bothered to distinguish between the
different varieties of querzblatz poetics?

Subject:      72 Hours
 
Just spent about 72 hours (not continuously!) in the darkest forests of
HTML. I continue to be amazed at what an extraordinarily intricate world
this is *at a technical* or writing level. (That is, like grammar, how
commands and operations mean different things at different times; how some
operations are misleading and so to be clear you must use a circumlocution -
or less-than-direct path between the trees.) This is a writing space where
the most minute movements are possible. Painfully incremental adjustments of
latitude and longitude; increments of relative positioning of both "inline"
and "floating" images; adjustments to physicality of the presentation
*itself* (do you want to specify the PROJECTED dimensions of the graphic?
what is its relation to the real dimensions of the graphic? do you wish to
adjust its number of colors, its resolution, its pixelation?) Is there a
difference in anyone's eye between the thousands of web pages that are
springing up (CNN, Ford, ATT True Savings - the announcement of this last
site really got me. As if those phone calls offering you deals on your long
distance service weren't already enough!) and a web-writing that is
different not from the obvious point of view of content but of *writing*? In
a piece of writing we also read the grammar (or misread it). Do we tend to
_read_ less when we're online? Perhaps it also took a while for people to
begin "reading" TV?

In-Reply-To:  <01I4JHXLN9TU8WWP5T@cnsvax.albany.edu>
 
About about: I quote William James, from "The Principles of Psychology,"
commenting on the substantive bias of language: "All dumb or anonymous
psychic states have, owing to this error [of supposing that where there is
no name no entity can exist], been cooly suppressed; or, if recognized at
all, have been named after the substantive perception they led to, as
thoughts 'about' this object or 'about' that, the monotonous word *about*
engulfing all their delicate idiosyncrasies in its monotonous sound.  Thus
the greater and greater accentuation and isolation of the substantive
parts have continually gone on."
 
In other words, language begins to get interesting when you go around
about, as Frost might have put it.  (Oh, that sounds like a challenge!)
 
Best,

html stands for HyperText Markup Language or something very much like that.
it's one of the types of computer code that is used to make web pages.
You can do all sorts of nifty things with it if you know what you're doing,
or even if you don't.  it's a pretty rudimentary system.  if you've got a
terminal around with netscape or mosaic, you can look at
 
http://www.cnw.com/~drclue/Formula_One.cgi/HTML/HTML.html
 
which is dr. clue's infobahn html guide and has much more info than i do.
if you don't have a graphical web browser like netscape around you may have
a text only browser like lynx available, but with lynx you can't see all
the cheesy graphics dr. clue put on his page.  maybe someone else knows the
url of a text-based info site?
 
hope this helps!

This is Kevin Killian.  I will never forget Billie Whitelaw in "Night
Watch," the US-financed thriller made in London around 1975? or so? where
she is the other woman Lawrence Harvey loves and so they both try to drive
Elizabeth Taylor crazy, and Taylor wears the most insane nightdress you've
ever seen . . . Billie Whitelaw must have seen that dress and then buried
herself up to the neck in sand in shock.
 
As for "Jane Eyre," any film that has Whitelaw, Plowright, Maria Schneider
(!!!!), Elle Macpherson (????), and GERALDINE CHAPLIN all in it will be
playing for years at our local camp theaters here in San Francisco, perhaps
in a triple bill with "Showgirls" and "Valley of the Dolls."

HyperText Mark-up Language
 
It's the coding required for the world wide web. A strange way to tell
things browsers like NetScape how to display language and images. And it's
the biggest such code going, although there are other possibilities, like
JAVA, which works in a rather different manner. But if one wants to do work
on the web, HTML is a part of the poetics.

Kevin, you're kidding! Maria Schneider is in another movie already? Oh,
lord! I have been hearing so much about "Jane Eyre." Thank goodness.
Because Whiyelaw has been in so many low budget unseen movies in recent
years.
 
Hey, how would that movie play on Turk Street if it had Nastasia Kinsky in it?

Gwyn: typing laziness on my part when it comes to e-mail
 
BUT, I can report at least one experience of being blasted heavily by an
anonymous reader for a journal who thought it outrageous that I should
use such a term as "L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E," which, despite its appearance in
books, articles etc., my anonymous ref. assured me NOBODY used anymore --
 
go figger!
 
--------------
about about: the responses to my last on this topic leave me if anything
further beclouded -- sounds as ig the objection isn't actually that some
poems "aren't about anything," but rather a strong reaction against what
they are in fact about?
 
remember that great sixties cliche, "we're about the business of . . ."?
 
Like Paul Blackburn, I remain as ever yours, in, on, or about the

My essay for the 50s conference at Orono was briefly orphaned by the
disappearance of the papers to either side of it, but Burt and Company
have now happily relocated me on panel 3B, at 3:30 on the first day of
the conference.  If you're interested in innovative poetics and
African-American writing, note that the panel now addresses Stephen
Jonas, Melvin Tolson and Russell Atkins.   (Though this means I will have
to miss other interesting panels, but maybe the Mina Loy panelists, for
example, will let me read copies?)

The poet Larry Levis has died. A heart attack. He was 49 and teaching in
Virginia. Born and raised near Fresno, CA. Student and long time friend of
Phil Levine. The books I have of his are The Afterlife, Wrecking Crew and
Winter Stars.  I have another one of his books, On Out by Lew Welch.  It is
inscribed:
 
 
For Larry --
get out of town
                           Lew
                                 7/10/68
 
 
I remember kicking field goals with him and his son through the goal posts of
almond trees at his mother's selma ranch. The mountain bluebirds down from
the sierra winter lighting on the short grafted trees. Playing pool at a
mexican bar in perfectly normal crossroads. A lowrider pulling up next to him
and saying: You and me man, we just can't get low enough. On his harley in
suit and his lovely bride in white on the back.  His gentle and sexy deep
voice.  He could never get a group of lions at the zoo to roar but would
instead have them swooning.  I'm going over to my mom's to get some
lampshades for Louise.
 
What follows is Rhododendrons by Larry Levis.
 
Rhododendrons
 
WINTER has moved off
somewhere, writing its journals
in ice.
 
But I am still afraid to move,
afraid to speak,
as if I lived in a house
wallpapered with the cries of birds
I cannot identify.
 
Beneath the trees
a young couple sits talking
about the afterlife,
where no one, I think, is
whittling toys for the stillborn,
I laugh,
 
but don't know.
Maybe the whole world is absent minded
or floating. Maybe the new lovers undress
without wondering how
the snow grows over the Andes,
or how a horse cannot remember those
frozen in the sleigh behind it,
but keeps running until the lines tangle,
while the dead sit coolly beneath their pet stars.
 
As I write this,
some blown rhododendrons are nodding
in the first breezes. I want
to resemble them, and remember nothing,
the way a photograph of an excavation
cannot remember the sun.
 
The wind rises or stops
and it means nothing.
 
I want to be circular;
a pond or a column of smoke
revolving, slowly, its aches.
 
I want to turn back and go up
to myself at age 20,
and press five dollars into his hand
so he can sleep.
While he stands trembling on a street in Fresno,
suddenly one among many in a crowd
that strolls down Fulton Street,
among the stores that are closing,
and is never heard of again.

So far as I know, nobody associated with the poetry itself ever used
the equal signs in a self-identifying fashion. Some others (critics,
reviewers and revilers) did so in order to associate the social
phenomenon with one of its later manifestations. I've always read the
equal signs as a special code on the part of an author as their way of
signalling "I don't get it"

Thanks for the pr for Small Press Traffic, Ron.  I thought the whole panel
was wonderfully provoking, the issues of racism and its relationship to
outsiderness and the yearning to be inside.
 
Your reading for us (here in San Francisco) at Four Walls was great too.  I
guess absence does make the heart grow fonder.

p.s.  For those of you who were not at the Stephen Jonas panel/event with

great bargain for you.   Jeff Conant & Woof Press took the occasion to
produce a limited edition broadside/lithograph-each one unique, hand
colored-of a "new" S. Jonas poem, made available to us by the executors of
the Jonas estate, Raffael de Gruttola and Gerrit Lansing.  Only $15.00 +

from Laura Hope-Gill c/o GHawkins@halcyon.com
 
In kind response to Bill Luoma's picture of Levis amid the almond tree
goalposts and outside the lion's cage, I want to offer more pictures of
him, from just January-- such a surprising short time until this.
 
I had the great however brief pleasure of knowing Larry Levis as
student/acquaintance at Warren Wilson College MFA Prog. last winter, my
first and his many-eth, and I am sad. remembering him clearly there in the
snowed-in campus, smoking a Marlboro,  drinking beer, the music from the
"Sweatheart Ball" coming out into the night, looking over the snow-buried
gardens and mountains saying "you expect Jack Nicholson to come around in
the SnowCat any second don't you?"
 
Larry Levis wore v-necked sweaters w/o turtleneck or undershirt under a
thin overcoat in 0 degree wind, broke mid-lecture into full-text "Life
Stories", danced madly in large steps and wide spins, quoted Talking Heads
in the same sentence as Ezra Pound and made it work.
 
He was calm, understated, dry, realistic, (when can we say "brilliant.")
When Tony Hoagland asked, after the reading and outside smoking, "How's
your class on "Thought and Feeling" coming along?" Levis responded, leaning
on the iced rail, exhaling thickly "I ditched the thought portion and my
life's been easier since."
 
I called a friend who was corresponding with him this semester and was as
of yesterday without "teacher," and we agreed: there's just a certain breed
of human we can't stand to lose.
 
A former student and friend of the poet sent us this excerpt from
"Adolescence" in Winter Stars:
 
>      -He had been drinking steadily all week,
>       And was dealing cards
>       When the muscle of his own heart
>       Kicked him back into his chair so hard its wood snapped.
>       He must have thought there was something
>       Suddenly very young inside his body,
>       If he had time to think . . .
 
I hear the heart attack was so massive he probably didn't know, and I hope.
 
There are others out there who are much sadder than I am I'm sure, with
deeper memories which pain more deeply,  and I wish you well with your
memories of "the Levis of the Levis of the Levis. ("Self Portrait with
Radio"), who did not "think that anything could choose me/ To be a Larry
Levis before there even was/ a Larry Levis. ("Family Romance")"
 
"When he died it was like a whole library had burned down." -Laurie Anderson
 
I am glad I saved the cap off the bottle of champagne shared between Levis
and a few students including myself at the final dinner, not knowing why I
was tucking it safely into my pocket as I believed myself "over" the
tchotchke phase (perhaps it's the swooning of lions, Bill), on which I read
today the word pressed into the metal: BRUT and think no,  not at all.
 
With warmest regards,

Ron,
 
I have used the equals to indicate the 'zine. What do these poets have
in common beyond the 'zine, anyway? Sure, there seems to be a common
reading list... one that was written about extensively in the 'zine! And
there are common publishers. I don't think of language poetry as a
school of poets so much as a group of readers who share their points of
view in similar forums. And, if it is a school, there are a lot of fish
swimming the other way! The 'zine was the hippest thing when it was
going. I might say you all had a common essay style, but that's about as
far as I would go.
 
I used to sneak reading time in L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E when I was supposed to
be shipping books. You were all very helpful to me because you let me
know that someone out there liked the same stuff. The universities sure
weren't foisting LZ or Gertrude.

as critic / reviler I never used "L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E School" or movement,
but was found on occasion using "L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E" to refer to writers who
in fact appeared in the pages of said mag., and to continue to
distinguish that from the journal _Language_, already on the scene before
Bernstein and Andrews got their stapler going --
 
But, Chris, I wasn't trying so much to coin a new movement as to make use
of that which has now been left behind, and is therefore there for the
taking?  If we are to write of "language writers," I think, particularly
since I work, when I work, at the same institution as Alan Soldofsky, one
of the ur-revilers who first loosed the unequal version of the misnomer
upon the world, that I should inherit those now unused symbols of
identity;  I'm such an egalitarian -- though I may not be equal to the
task --
 
As Dodie & Kevin mentioned -- Those Jonas broadsides are BEAUTIFUL --
Jeff Conant's work is a prize -- each sheet is different from the others
-- GET ONE OF THESE! -- better than yr average broadside == dare I say,

Dear Friends,
 
Thanks for the orders for RIBOT and FROM THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE CENTURY. We still have copies of all of
these, and can fill further orders at the same prices
($4.00 for the RIBOTS) and ($5.00 for the anthology) if
you missed out on this good sale. We'll plan sales of
other slightly damaged S&M titles from time to time.
 
I'm writng at this moment, however, to announce a new
magazine of the internet: WHERE LITERATURE LIVES. The
first issue, #1, is now up at the Sun & Moon web-site
(http://www.sunmoon.com). This will be a monthly mag-
azine with selections from forthcoming Sun & Moon titles,

do in EL-E-PHANT) and other literary information.
 
The first issue, designed by the remarkable Kenny
Goldsmith, contains fiction by Spanish writer Norberto
Luis Romero, a selection from the new novel NOD, by Fanny

just goes to show how such comparisons are misleading. And yes, I found
the interview where Creeley and Ginsburg are talking about music.
Creeley said that he was writing while listening to jazz.

I thought this might be useful to at least a few on the Poetics List. I
haven't checked it out enough to know if such special collections as
SUNY/Buffalo's Poetry Room, or UC-San Diego's Archive for New Poetry, or SF
State's American Poetry Archive, are included. One would hope so, as well as
other treasures perhaps. Some of the sites which concern book arts and
alternative book forms may be of interest to those interested in
textual/visual concerns.

Subject: formal continuum/conspicuous repetition
 
Dear Mark Wallace,
 
        My email access is restored and I can finally think about the
compelling issues raised by our recent discussions about innovative form.
It seems to me that the distinction between "innovative" and
'noninnovative" forms, implicitly raised by your comment that I had
overlooked certain forms in my AWP piece, may be an unnecessary
distinction.  Perhaps, as Michael Boughn has suggested,  the distinction
between formal and nonformal poems is, in the final analysis, also an
unnecessary distinction, and poems are all formal but lie along a continuum
between regular and irregular form.  In the AWP piece, as in the Formal
Feeling Comes anthology, I tried to define the characteristics that bring a
poem closer to the regularly formal end of the continuum, namely a
structure formed by conspicuous repetition of any language element.
        The question is, is there anything in that definition to rule out
innovative poetry.  After considering the texts you mentioned in your
fascinating bibliography, I still don't think there is any opposition
between my definition of form and innovative language use.   There may be
temperamental disinclination among many "innovative" poets to use regularly
repeating forms,  which may be why I had such a hell of a time finding
regularly formal innovative poets for the anthology.  But they do exist, as
you so rightly point out; Henry Gould,  Jackson MacLow,  Juliana Spahr,
etc., are certainly writing regularly formal poems.
        The two points I would make are these:   First, I have yet to see
(though I would LOVE to see) a regular form that is truly, in and of
itself,  an Innovative  Form--in other words, a form, according to the
structured by conspicuous repetition definition, that is truly NEW in a
significant way.  Jackson MacLow, of whom I am now a staunch fan, and who I
am extremely grateful to you for making me read again, does wonderfully
innovative things IN form,  but the forms themselves are familiar forms; he
uses a kind of pantoum in "HappyNew Year 1964," "syllabics in "Odes for
Iris,"  concrete or shaped poems, a sonnet once in a while, and most of the
time, even in incarnations as fresh as "Molly Go" and certainly in poems
like the Light poems, a form as old as the hills, very flexible and often
overlooked as a form, but a familiar regular form nonetheless: the chant.
        Is it possible that regular forms are like the letters of the
alphabet--you can do things with them that are new, but they themselves are
basically simple tools, hard to improve on, Dr. Seuss's On Beyond Zebra
notwithstanding?  If this is true, getting that fact out into the open
would certainly simplify the field of poetics at the formal end of the
continuum.   I am, of course, keeping here to the definition of formal
poetry as structured by the conspicous repetition of any language element,
a definition that is practical and of necessity somewhat reductionistic.
The fact that irregular form, organic form, and larger formal/thematic
structures also operate in much contemporary poetry at the "irregular" end
of spectrum shouldn't interfere with the usefulness of a firm definition of
what is formal at the "regular" end.
        The other point concerns what Michael Boughn calls  'deformations,"
poems that change/deform received forms.  After much thought on this
matter, it seems to me that, while all deformations of a traditional form
can certainly be usefully thought of as akin to each other, some
deformations remain at the formal end of the continuum while others do not.
To take the sonnet as an example,  the deformations I included in A Formal
Feeling Comes are still regularly formal--some rhymed nonmetrical sonnets,
some unrhymed metrical sonnets, some metrically variable but still metrical
sonnets, some 16 or 18 line sonnets or 12 line sonnets that kept the rhyme
and meter.  All these deformations are still formal, because they are
structured by the conspicuous repetition of language elements.  Bernadette
Mayer's deformations of the sonnet, while it is interesting to consider
them in the context of the more formal deformations--which is why I
mentioned them in the introduction to A Formal Feeling Comes-- are on the
other hand not regularly formal, in my opinion, since the only elements of
the sonnet they keep are the name and the length and they are otherwise
irregular in structure (length, by itself, seems a quality of extension or
size, not of structure or shape, or else any nineteen-line poem would be a
villanelle).
        At this point, my preference in editing the upcoming book would be
to include "innovative" poems, poems with nonreferential or nonsequential
language, among the more mainstream poems, as much as the editors of the
individual sections (the section for each form will be edited by a
different poet) would like/will permit.   Unless any innovative regular
forms turn up that really WON'T fit under the existing rubrics of chant,
concrete poem, syllabic poem, etc.,  it seems an inappropriate
ghettoization to isolate innovative poems in a separate section based on
their language when their forms would include them in already existing
sections.
        Any poets who do have innovative regularly formal poems, by
themselves or others,  that they'd like to have considered (keeping in mind
that this anthology will consist largely of pre-20th century poems, so
space is very limited for contemporary work) should contact me or Kathrine
Varnes, my coeditor (kvarnes@udel.edu), and we will forward the work to the
appropriate section-editor; also anyone who has a strong proclivity for a
certain form and might want to edit a section on it, please contact us and
we'll see if the form is still available.
        Many thanks, Mark, for forwarding this message to the poetics list.

 I still remember the profile of Franz "Bugsy" Kafka  2b, known for his
problems w the management, and the opening logo of the baseball diamond
pasted-in between the two legs of a Blakean compass.  Who wrote that book?  I
lost my copy long ago.
 
My baseball memory begins with the Baltimore Orioles of 1964, Brooks
Robinson's MVP year, and the arrival of Frank Robinson in 1966, how he played
w an intensity, pride, AND self-abnegation that I had never seen before
(willingness to hit a ground ball to the right side to move a runner up
despite leading the league in home runs, slamming the only homer completely
out of Memorial Stadium off El Tiante after being decked twice by pitches
aimed at his head, etc.).  Many years later, when Frank Robby was part of the
visiting Orioles' office staff, I waited outside in the rain at Yankee
Stadium after a game hoping to get his autograph.  When he opened the door to
see how hard it was raining, I pleaded: "Frank!  I've been a fan of yours for
20 years--you gotta sign my glove!" He looked down at me and said with a
smile, "No I don't," and shut the door.  Elrod Hendricks, bullpen coach at
the time, and also a player on the 60's Orioles, was a lot kinder.  I guess
I'm just telling this pointless story to see if there are any other Orioles
fans lurking on the elist...

yeah, but.  information isn't *always* a commodity, is it?  sometimes the
stuff's just got no "market value" and is nothing but some used up brain
cells.  seems like a lot of my classmates have the idea that we show up to
our very first college class and some old bearded man in a tweed jacket
(leather arm patches optional) hands them a big plastic bag which we are
supposed to spend the next four (or five or six) years filling.  then the
idea is (supposedly) that we take our bags o' facts to our first job and
wow em.   (!)
i dunno, maybe if someone had created a really good sorting system for
their bag it might be impressive.  mine's worn a hole through the bottom
already and i can never find anything but poetry anthologies and pop-tart
wrappers except the one time i found my marbles.
 
anyway, i'd hope that more people start to figure out that a bag o' tricks
(so to speak) might be handier in "the real world".

   Dear Mark Wallace---
    Thanks for forwading Annie Finch's remarks on poetry.
    I am going to have to print the message out before I can respond more
    fully, and hopefully then, some of the distinctions she makes between
    formally innovative poems, etc, will become clearer.
    But, valuing a stance of "naivete" as I do, I'm curious as to some of
    the applications of these distinctions. In considering form as a criteria
    for anthologies (ostensibly in disregard of other aesthetic/tonal/
    emotional/ concerns), do these other (ostensibly non-formal) considerations
    slip in through the backdoor as it were?
    For instance, there seemed to be an implicit (latent--though I may be
    simply reading this into Ms. Finch's remarks) PREFERENCE for the "regular"
    forms of MacLow over the "irregularities" of Mayer. Does this mean that
    Ms. Finch would be more apt to include Maclow in her forthcoming
    anthology than Mayer (let's get down to the realpolitik of it!)?
    I am also wondering if my recent series CUSPS (Aerial/Edge, 1995--
    I think Rod still has copies) would be considered as "innovative
    regular formal" or "innovative irregular formal" (or neither)....
    Chris

This is an interesting question.  My first reaction would be that every
form had to be a new form at some point in history, so the advent of
really new forms would have to be a probability.  On the other hand,
perhaps forms like the sonnet or the villanelle should be considered
"finishings" rather than something really new.  If one tries to view
the whole span of poetry history, the sense is that distinct forms
emerged out of an archaic ritual matrix in which specific song-
forms filled particular communal roles, so that more recent, "literary"
forms might be "finished" conversions on an older "alphabet", rather
than really new.
 
What then is this "finish" - and is there a potential for "really new"
forms in contemporary writing on a par with the sonnet (i.e. not
really REALLY new, but new conversions of an older alphabet)?  Perhaps
the common element in finish is a kind of complexity - an added layer
of self-consciousness or reflexivity or awareness which renovates
a slumbering form - or a slumbering social reality which instigates
a form.  Here again, though I hate to sound axe-grinding repetitive,
poets might find some useful tools in the study of formal logic.
CS Peirce's logic/semiotic is all about how new knowledge is worked
out by way of an acute awareness of the linguistic workings of thought
itself - his "logic of relatives" (warning: I'm a novice here & am probably
misrepresenting this) seems to be about discovering new meaning
in the structural overlay of term/hypothesis/proposition/argument -
i.e. hypothesis is built in to the structure of EVERY verbal statement.
So that in this day & age "really new" forms might grow out of
a logical systematic built into poems - that poets might discover
these forms by grounding verbal "hypotheses"(i.e. the "content")
in the concrete "evidence" or "argument" of the form.  (Here "form"
and "content" would be reversible - and Peirce's category of
"thirdness" or meaning/law would play the role of structure or
completion - the "formal feeling").  This is probably already
being done by several poets.  And these new new formalists are
probably breaking hearts just like the old ones. - Henry Gould

First of all,
Bernadette Mayer does not preserve the codified length of a sonnet
(14 lines) consistently throughout her book
_The Sonnets_. Some go 16.
 
Second of all,
To call all repetition of a given word chant is to collapse
In a heap the distinctions between jazz and plainsong,
Light poems and sleeping with women.
 
Third of all,
I'm hearing all these echoes of the
Alfred Corn discussion is anyone else. A sonnet
Is not sitting down and writing some metronomically correct thing.
 
And neither am I.
There's usually a turn in a sonnet but all I hear is one side of the argument.

Subject:      formal/continuum addendum
 
Another thought on Annie Finch's post : seems like the "search for new forms"
would want to take chaos theory into account.  Here's CS Peirce in 1884,
a century before chaos theory arrived:
 
  "You have all heard of the dissipation of energy.  It is found that in all
transformations of energy a part is converted into heat and heat is always
tending to equalize its temperature.  The consequence is that the energy of
the universe is tending by virtue of its necessary laws toward a death of the
universe in which there shall be no force but heat and the temperature
everywhere the same.
   We may say that we know enough of the forces at work in the universe
to know that there is none which can counteract this tendency away from
every definite end but death.
   But although no force can counteract this tendency, chance may and will
have the opposite influence.  Force is in the long run dissipative; chance
is in the long run concentrative.  The dissipation of energy by the
regular law of nature is by those very laws accompanied by circumstances
more and more favorable to its reconcentration by chance.  There must
therefore be a point at which the two tendencies are balanced and that
is no doubt the actual condition of the whole universe at the present
time."
 
Rigid formal structures in poetry might be considered analogues of entropy
as Peirce describes it above; I have certainly found in my own writing
that forms increase the opportunities for chance combinations.  Perhaps
the "finished", literary forms such as the sonnet are, again, chance
recombinations expressing social entropy of some kind.  The difficulty
is finding a real home in forms, rather than a sense of school project
or alienated rhetorical hat-trick.  Maybe form is like the rundown tenement
occupied by squatter architect-gardeners, where entropy becomes
possibility.  Or, in Mandelstam's words, "classicism is revolution",
and "tall grass is growing in the streets of St. Petersburg". - Henry Gould

What's not "at stake" is the "temperamental disinclination among many
'innovative' poets to use regularly repeating forms" but rather what "counts"
as "linguistic elements"--e.g., the sentence (the period), the phrase, the
phoneme, a "regular" propensity for the ampersand, his relentless ability to
work the word "blue" into every line, your sudden happenstance decision to
print every poem in the last half of the book in the shape of a hippogriff?
Form of the utterance, form of the text?  Form of the noise, form of the

fractious fomenting re form?

By this definition, would Daphne Marlatt's use of space/silence as a part
of the alphabet of her poetic form be a regular repeating form...or is it
no form at all?

Subject:      formal continuum
 
     Dear Annie Finch,
 
        It seems apparent from having viewed this discussion about the AWP
     piece for the last few months that your idea of the "regular formal"
     includes a specific metric rhythm and that this rhythm is observed
     only in terms of the line it occurs within. These limitations directly
     result in your observation of not having seen "a truly innovative
     form" with your search. Had I the same constraints would have surmised
     the same conclusion.
        When the formalized criteria is widened in dimensions to include a
     work that is written in series, the first thing one notices from the
     "irregular" form (as you termed it) is what elements work toward
     regularizing the rest of the piece. Within a masterwork, one finds that
     the defining elements of regularities rest within the axiom and create
     a core for a piece of work to be understood. When repetition occurs in
     large series of pieces, it is no longer the structure of the language
     element which one concerns themselves with but rather what center does
     this series revolve around and refine through its innaccuracies and
     reververations to the evolving form.
        I would like to take the epistolary form as an example. Rather than
     fitting your definition of a strict metrical form, these types of
     pieces rely upon the tone of the lyric as a methodology to establish
     what contitutes the form. The material often focuses on what cannot be
     said to another in person because of the inaccuracies within the
     referent of the body, and some closing of the past through the event of
     the letter. That Heloise could not reach her emotions for Abelard until
     the bodies were no longer a signifier-chain which diffused or confused
     meaning. That syntactical logic for Cicero only had a direct
     correlation to the page and could not be constructed otherwise. That
     Paul could not tell the Corinthians what to do in person. When reading
     any of these in series one relies upon the understanding of tone and
     timber, coveyed by the syllables and syntax more than the metrical
     structure of the piece. While mono-syllabics may induce a palipitation
     for revolution in a letter from Neruda or a staccato of laughter from
     Pope, it is discerning the tone of the speaker which is the form. These
     ideas themselves have went through further transliterations as one
     could experience through the recent work of Alice Notley's Descent of
     Alette where the tone of the voice itself is nearly impossible to
     discern, thereby adding to the epic and epistilary form through a new
     conveyance of voice.
        I think your decision to avoid the "informal poetries" severely
     limits your capacity for exhumation of past forms and for present
     discoveries and do hope that some of the words on this list will be
     conducive for challenging your opion as expressed in the AWP article.
 
 
     Be Well

Subject:      SPT's annual soiree
 
Hi, this is Dodie Bellamy.  The board of Small Press Traffic asked me to
post the following:
 
U.S. Poet Laureate to be honored by San Francisco's Small Press Traffic
 
Robert Hass, Poet Laureate of the United States, will be among the guests
honored at Small Press Traffic's annual Soir=E9e benefit on June 2, 1996. Th=
e
fundraising event celebrates SPT's recent move of its Literary Arts Center
to New College of California at 777 Valencia in San Francisco.
 
A number of the Bay Area's important literary figures will be in
attendance, including Francisco X. Alarc=F3n (Lenguas Sueltas Poemas),
Barbara Guest (Fair Realism), Thom Gunn (The Man with Night Sweats), Ginu
Kamani (Junglee Girl) and Janice Mirikitani (Shedding Silence). In
addition, there will be an auction of signed manuscript pages by the above
mentioned writers as well as signed works of William S. Burroughs, Ted
Berrigan, Dorothy Allison, Richard North Patterson and others. Food and
beverages will be provided, plus music by Megan Bierman on the tenor
saxophone.
 
The Sunday event will be held from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. at the San Francisco
home of Edith Jenkins. Parking will be available. A tax-deductible donation
of $40-$60 is requested. Call (415) 437-3454 for more information and
reservations.
 
Small Press Traffic was founded in 1974 by a group of writers and
individuals who saw the need for an outlet for new and experimental writers
and small press publications. From being primarily a bookstore, Small Press
Traffic has evolved into a presenting organization sponsoring writing
workshops and readings throughout the year, with special attention to
emerging writers. Small Press Traffic's new home at New College will also
allow the organization to establish a writing/publishing resource library
open to the public.

Keith,
     Thank you, and about time.
     If the question of where our poetics might go from here--which is
surely a preoccupation of Mark's, but also a question vital to  life of
my interest in the list--is put in the terms of where once it was the
only answer usefully elicited is an insistence on where, at least, it

It would seem, unfortunately, that Milosz et al do not understand
the medium. People who would have never cracked a book of poetry are
now reading it on the internet. A traditionally printed magazine of
poetry may be able to reach only a few hundred people -- but a
webzine of the same can reach thousands. Granted, much of the poetry
out there on the internet is BAD... but this wasn't the question. As
for "serious" poetry -- who makes the determination?
 
If I recall correctly, Czeslaw Milosz is featured on a web site...
 
As for the "low popular appeal of poetry"... "To a poor reader,"
Laurence Perrine wrote in _Literature: Structure, Sound, and Sense_,
"poetry will often seem dull and boring, a fancy way of writing
something that could be said more simply. So might a colorblind man
deny that there is such a thing as color." I'd have to say it is not
a matter of "popular appeal," but rather the state of literacy in
this nation. If the average person shuns reading a newspaper, can
you expect him/her to read poetry?

Just to contribute to this discussion a bit: I think the analogy to the
alphabet *complicates* rather than simplfies formal discussions.  I have
two questions:
 
1) would a poem count for you as regular form if it used "conspicuous
repetition"  at the alphabetic level?  (Say a poem is lineated around the
principle of "three f's per line."  Is the letter an "element of
language" like the phoneme?
 
2) are new letters really that unlikely?  A friend of mine is carving
lithograph blocks into an alphabet for printing his poems.  He's adding a
few new letters for good measure (pardon the pun).
 
Cheers,
David

Subject:      continuum (ht_lit & poetics coincide in xanadu)
 
The copyrighted alphabet
although apparently a foolish issue
becomes serious
when transclusion
or the enforcement of copyright on the internet
is discussed.
Transclusion is a form of 'sideways publishing'
in which documents are maintained permanently
in a sort of electronic alexandria
or 'xanadu' as its inventor Ted Nelson calls it.
Once published
a bit of text
may be read by anyone
for a copyright fee
measured in nanodollars.
Everyone may read all documents
and there is no trace, no record
of the payment
and so no record of who has read what.
A document
such as 'The Waste Land'
that incorporates other texts
may do so
by linking to those other texts.
The copyright on samples
is maintained
in this system, the trademark of which is
'eternal-flaming-x'.
The fear
(if I understand this system
and there is a strong chance I do not)
was that someone
would (as domain speculators had,
buying up licenses to obviously profitable
names like bigmac or usa)
copyright the alphabet,
collecting microscopic royalties
on every text published
in perpetuity.
Bob Holman's alphabet presumes
a world in which the 'r'
has been claimed. The plural of being?
or the brand of Bob's ranch.
We all have letters we forego.
This letter goes out three days too soon.

But why are some forms "traditional"?  Is it worth making a distinction
(I'm not saying a value judgement) between forms that are old - have been
around - and 20th century forms in the "tradition of invention"?  Does
it have something to do with "occasion" - that forms like the sonnet
began as chance developments out of various entropies of cultural
demand  - or occasions?  The occasion of 20th century forms is often
simply the occasion of their making - or the occasion of freedom from
occasions (demands).  Is there a difference between the multitude of
whimsical wheeled contraptions and the major occasions for travel
(car, bike, stroller)?  In looking for new forms (if this is not a
dead goose chase) as opposed to forms of "the new" should we open
our eyes to what "occasion" might mean today in a social/cultural
sense (it might be very different from past meanings). - Henry Gould

     Of course, it might be worth remembering that the title is lifted
    from the first line of a Dickinson poem...
    AFTER GREAT PAIN, a formal FINCH comes....
    Is the Dickinson poem itself a "traditional" form?
    After all, it is one of those Dickinson poems that does not really
    fit the "amazing grace"/"heartbreak hotel"/"yellow ribbon of texas"/
            "gates of eden" pattern--
    and so I am also interested in the co-optation of Dickinson as a formalist
    (which i distrust at least as much as the co-optation of Dickinson by the
     Grenier types---you know "the message is the handwriting"....)

Then we have to also remember that after great hors d'oeuvres an informal
Stroffolino comes... but some poets are themselves the occasion for poetry,
and form follows incarnation as swallow follows finch.  - Henry Gould

According to my aviary sources, Dickinson's "finch" in fact turned out to
be a relatively exotic sparrow (or do I have that backwards?) -- &
somewhere I read that all of her poems can be recited in the meter & tune
of "Train in Vain" (or maybe "El Paso" but only with Weir! singing).

I am surprised at the interest in "counting" as form. Form is plainly
what anyone is or is not in, when they write--- on a good day, so to speak ---
 when things go right --- as with any other sport. Counting is no
more a measure of success in writing than checking out the golden
mean and other similar proportional divisions in a painting is a
meausre of anything except the goofiness of the measurer.

Hey Tony,
 
Re:form (again).  Who's talking about counting?  I said I was curious about
what counts (i. e. what so-called "linguistic elements" "matter") when one
talks about "form" (from outside the process, as a critic, someone chomping on
Plato's dream-bit, etc.) Quotes around "counting" just pun-fun.
 
But I'm curious--given your definition of form as something you're in or not
(and you're always in fine form, Tony)--when would you know or say or guess
someone or something is "in form"? Let's say--since we're almost talking about
it--something a number of people have agreed to call a poem?
 
As for what's at stake (not your question) more questions from me: Is there
really anyone out there who would not like to see a proliferation of forms?
Why would one want to limit or legislate forms?  And someone once wrote that
"Inflexible standardization is the arteriosclerosis of language."  Who would
argue with that in this for(u)m?  But that's not what Annie Finch is arguing
anyway (is it Annie?). I take it that she's saying something closer to what
Nathaniel Tarn once wrote (in "The Issue of 'New Forms'"):  "There are a
limited number of topics around which our critical arguments revolve over and
over again--as if they were stuck in some monstrous groove.  One of them is
the question of new forms--as if we were never to realize that, in essence,
these forms were extraordinarily limited. . ." [He then goes on to talk of
"content.'  No doubt many would take issue with Tarn's essay.]  Anyway, that's
what I took to be "at stake" in Annie Finch's remarks (I may be wrong.) To
respond more directly to Maria D, I'd guess that what's most often "at stake"
in these debates about "form" is "the politics of poetic form"--which is of
course a very big topic I ain't agonna get into here.
 
Or, thinking of George B and Sam B, one might just ask how does one go on?  Or
perhaps it's just how or why I go on right now when the Bulls and Knicks have
already tipped off?

in form? in the work worth publishing (from the writer's point of
view): off form, when the work won't go right. I'm not interested in
conventional structures -- that's the term -- so much as genres of
discourse, occasions and audiences. "Form" is in my mind more a word
for pre-given structures, hence the tendency for formalists to want
to count things in them, to make sure that they are all there and in
the right order. Isn't the problem of pre-given forms to do with the
way that any precipitation of sense is apt to overflow or negate such
things of necessity. I'm hooked on the "never more than" of the
Creeley sentence...never mjore than an exdtension of content, in the
sense of wanting to say something  that takes form as it goes. Form,
then, is a process of forming, a verb rather than a noun -- hence my
sense of form as being in or on form as one writes. But this is
familiar to many on this list I'm sure as Olsonian or Creelesque.
Isn't the fifties poetics of Olson set up much in opposition to a
fomalism  a correctness of conventional verse patterns or
structures?  Tell me if I'm way off track..

mayhaps gwyn would like to explain quertzblatz some more, i think she
coined it, or at least introduced it to the list, and i think jordan uses
it more than anyone else, so one might hope he know's what he's saying :-).
 
one of the things i like about the word is that it doesn't feel like it's
really defined yet.  i take it's meaning to be something just a little left
of 'experimental', less stale.  and like i've said before, it's got a q in
it, can't beat a good word with a q in it.  extra points in scrabble.

My dictionary, Eryque, supplies only one t for querzblatz. It cites Gwyn
McVay. As I've said before, though, I don't really know the meanings of
these words that I seem to need to keep saying. All I can tell from the
contexts in which I've used this word is that it seems to be connected to
the procedures of vast avant-gardes without having noisome parameanings.
 
Correction: this seems to be somebody else's dictionary.
 
On a different topic: can somebody tell me what the point of all this
poetry writing is? I remember hearing something about 'the love of the
good' and I wonder if anybody else heard this thing more clearly, and could
run an ideology check on it for me.
 
 
Thanks!
Jordan
 
PS Chris S uses querzblatz more often than I do.

Amen!  This posting coincides with a very interesting meeting which I
attended recently where I witnessed those who believed in the viability
of the Internet as a research tool, a method of preserving and disseminating
information trying to coerce/convince/assuage the hesitations of others to
make a concerted step to move forward and embrace the Internet in a
Library/Research atmosphere (and I will add some of the fears
were justifiable and raised good questions which will need good solutions)
I had myself shunned computers a la Kurt Vonnegut - and saw DHLawrence's
wisdom when he wrote in Studies in Classic American Literature "the machine
is the greater neuter...in the end it emasculates us all" -- But there is
undeniably an impact being made through the progressive spirit of those
who embrace the Internet as a tool to explore/instruct/ and enhance the
acquisition of knowledge and I whole-heartedly embrace these positive
aspects: the Internet has so many advantages for poets -
1)one is not subject to a publisher- one is free to explore/experiment
2) even if the poetry is not refined/honed, the poet will be exposed to
more poetry through his/her interest in the subject by doing a simple Net
search - thus almost self-teaching, or at least refining taste by being
introduced to new styles and perhaps a different approach.
3) Poetry may be in popular decline now - but the younger generation which is
being  raised in this paradgim will appreciate creativity & the freedom
of the Net and perhaps poetry will see a resurgence and
4) small press publishers indie book sellers will benefit in the long run
because people will develop a taste for certain authors and may seek out to own
a copy.
5)New marriages of poetry and art and sound will occur, and the public
will be exposed to them rather than waiting for PBS to produce a series ;
6.) the hypertextual poem has been born opeing up new routes of reading,
different levels of meaning - for example Ken Sherwood and Alexis Kirke
and others are experimenting with hypertextual poems (take a look at the author
section of the EPC) --
7)In addition to that Loss Glazier has crafted a
unique Poetry resource for poets/researchers etc -- the exposure poets
receive (free to both poet and audience -- plus the audience is global)
is remarkable and cannot be duplicated in print.
 
Nobel Prize winners may question its viability, but we should not allow
that to shadow any of the progress being made -- There will always be a
struggle between those whose arms are folded and those who run to embrace.
(Personally I still prefer to read a book - but the value found on a
computer screen connected to the world is all too seductive.)

Comments: cc: finchar@muohio.edu
 
Re "what's at stake" in the formal question. I tend to think Hejinian's "The
Rejection of Closure" a place to start. Rasula's _Wax Museum_ pretty good for
recent history, though I think Berrigan, Mayer, etc. deserve more than
footnote. Cage's _Silence_ also something to be known. I tend to think that
the terms open & closed, tho often used cavalierly w/ regard to form, do, in
the end, have descriptive meaning. Personally, I prefer the open.
 
Gwyn mentioned Notley-- heard her read at St. Mark's last week, from _Alette_
and other stuff. Very engaging.
Must say I was disappointed in her essay in _Disembodied Poetics_ -- equating
"literary theory" with "hipness."
& this-- ". . . poetry has become more & more intellectual & specialized, has
become words." This is essentially an attack upon & dismissal of most of what
I consider the most interesting work done since the early seventies from a
poet I consider extremely complex and interesting. Her argument is
essentially for a return to the allegorical as a source. Which I don't
dismiss--
it can work, obvious. Read Blake. Joris & Rothenberg's choice of Blake to
open their anthology is relevant here I think. It's a matter of the pressure
of attention brought to the process of composition-- Blake's powerfully
allegorical but madly satisfyingly OPEN as well, I believe. A pretty hip lit
theorist in his way.
 
Two arguments for open form:
 
"Truth is a contrivance based on opinion which is always learned."  --Kathy
Acker
&
"Both belief and denial throw existence into question."
  --Carla Harryman
 
Thing is, it's open, form, whether you think it is or not. So, work that
knows that, starts with that, I think, has a leg up. O'Hara, talking relative
to the Beat interest in jazz as source for the work sd he preferred
painting-- "painting is static and therefore tragic." But I think an
interesting counter to that comes from Picasso (tho Duchamp sd similar)--
that "A painting goes on changing according to whoever is looking at it."
That's the open, or part of it, I'm intending here. Duchamp said: "A work of
art is always completed by the observer."

this may come from sheer blissful ignorance but im having trouble
distinguishing form from technique in this discussion, especially
in light of tony greens comments.  one can have fine technique and
not be "in form". can one follow a form (?closed) with no technique?
are  form and technique identical, similar, or mutually exclusive?

Clive Matson makes essentially the same point in _exquiste corse_ #57
"The sterile reading of Duncan's poetry by many of his peers displays the
limits of literary culture.  People may be so deadened that they cannot
feel."
     Is closed form a barrier against feeling?  Is open form a way of
avoiding feeling?  While this may seem oblique to the topic at hand,
Ithink it's quite relevant and significant, as Rod goes on to note
(from my reading of his post):

John Cage is inevitably mentioned. He once said to me that after
he had heard any piece of his more than once, it began to sound
melodic! Eric Mottram's response when I told him this was that
the human brain is inherently incapable of producing something
which is formless. Which is why Cage didn't like improvisation;
he said it was too predictable.

This is what I was getting at when I mentioned form as increasing
possibilities for chance developments.  Hey I got an idea - closed
wear red shirts, open wear blue. then we'll know what's at stake
and who's the good guys.  Did anybody read what I wrote about
form-occasions, or a trichotomy beyond the form/content binary
politico-emotiono-football game, or form as entropy (rather than
"funeral")?  Do we have to trumpet the same old camps?  Anybody home?

   Timothy Leary, who has terminal cancer, is going to kill himself
   "live" on the Internet. How do we feel about it here at Exquisite
   Corpse? First, we are going to declare him the first Exquisite Corpse
   of the Millenium. Secondly, we commend him for inventing the new art
   of Public Self-Snuff, a performance art long anticipated. Thirdly, we
   look forward to the Internet Public Self-Snuff of thousands of lesser
   luminaries, to be followed surely by mass suicides. The Avantgarde, as
   we know, always ends up at Wal-Mart sooner or later. Fourthly, we
   congratulate ourselves on having been the first to propose the idea of
   the Net as an Afterlife. Now, we will not only have cemeteries in
   cyber-space but actual "live" suicides. We also proposed that the Net
   Afterlife is nature's way of thinning the affluent (who don't die fast
   enough) with the help of their own toys. (The poor will always die
   like they have, from poverty, diseases and anonymity). Fifthly, we
   salute Tim for taking the spotlight off Kevorkian who now becomes just
   an old-fashioned audience/assistant: Tim turns all of us into
   Kevorkians, who can voyeurize and abet. Sixthly, we remeber reading
   Leary's Psychedelic Prayers in a heightened state and finding them
   pretty humorous.We will certainly miss his Irish charm and verve.
   Surely he will make a splendid saint in the Great Bardo. Go, Tim.

Tom Beard,
 
"Querzblatz" (although "quertz-" is an acceptable variant spelling) has
absolutely no meaning nor etymology whatsoever. I made it up. It is
supposed to accomodate the poetries and poetics that words like
"experimental," "avant-garde," "language," "innovative" (although that
last may come closest) don't cover; I was tired of not having a word. It
has Q and Z in it because those are the letters not on the telephone
dial, and they sound cool.

Subject:      a formal flinch
 
     I brought up "Descent of Alette" in conjunction with the form of the
     epistle as a way to open the subject inherent within the tenor of
     voice as a new form fostered by repetition. Not only does Alette's
     form bring forth a sense of breath simialr to the WCW foot, but also
     challenges and agrees with Wah's insistence of the oversized sentence
     fitting the capacity of new form through Notley's use of
     capitilization without punctuation. It seems that Annie's definition
     of form does not allow for discovery through anti-polarity of
     exposition, even when repetition is present. What I mean is if you
     have a poem without an "I" it's one of the features that demarcates
     its composition. That one can define through a process of exposure, of
     what is not held within the definition.
 
     Rod: If I remember correctly only a few sections of "Descent" are in
     the _Scarlet Cabinet_ not all.

and what can we do against it.
Write poems for your friends to help keep them alive
while you try to watch out where you're going
reading the poems your friends write for you.
Dharmok and Jilad at Tenagra.

I know the _Descent of Alette_ in _The Scarlet Cabinet_
begins & ends the same way the Pngn edition does. I'll check pg count when I

There's an aspect of Nelson's scheme (as he describes it in his
wonderful book, Literary Machines) that is of great importance but
doesn't get pushed enough these days, and which works against this
phenomenon.  Copyright owners today get control over who can use
intellectual property, and the right to demand money for any use at
rates that they set themselves in any way they please.  In the Xanadu
system, when you publish something, you have no control over its use,
and although you get paid for any use you can't set the rates.  Such a
system would fix the major problem for anyone trying to publish
something electronically today that draws on existing materials: the
problem of getting permissions from a raft of copyright owners, and
possibly having to pay absurdly high rates.  The technical problems
with electronic publishing are trivial by comparison.  In the Xanadu
system you wouldn't ask for permission, and you'd know right away what
you'd be charged; someone like Bill Gates might buy up rights to all
the querzblatz poetry in the Xanadu system, but it wouldn't affect its
availability or the cost of reading it.
 
The copyrighted alphabet is still a real issue that users of any
Xanadu system would have to work out: Nelson gives an example of a new
text within the system that would consist of an old one with the
modification of a single word, so the idea that you could routinely
claim rights to quite small bits of text does seem essential to the
system.  I also don't see anything in Literary Machines about the term
of ownership---it does appear to be perpetual, which is a problem.
(The book doesn't ever suggest that you could sell or transfer the
rights to your texts in any way, and the system it describes is based
on private contracts rather than copyright, but some way of
transferring rights is probably inevitable.)  Not that things appear
to be heading in a xanalogical direction, in any case...

What? I was just writing an essay explaining that it was an

type. You have no right to say it is meaningless; it no longer
belongs to you. As soon as a sound is uttered or an arrangement
of letters is placed upon a page and others assign it a sense,
it goes straight into God's Dictionary. Is "chortle" nonsense
just because Lewis Caroll so intended? If you want to invent a
meaningless word, best keep it to yourself.

ah, I think this is what I mean when I ask what's at stake--yes, of course
I'm aware of the politics of open form & all that...& I assume HG is
tongue-in-cheek here but he doesn't seem that far off...when I ask "what's
at stake" what I mean is what HG gets at: why is the form issue such a
threat that we end up debating closed v. open (& I'd go further--open lyric
narrative v. open querzblatz) so much?  And when Annie Finch says "what
you're doing is not what I'd consider the creation of new forms"...what does
the response to her show?  In rejecting old capital F forms on political
grounds, what I'm wondering is, why the apparent drive to gain acceptance in
the same quarters those capital Fs haunt?  To say, ok, my work is as valid &
vigorously crafted as so-&-so's villanelle, so recognize that, Annie, let me
in...but if we reject those old forms (& the criteria for judging &
inhabiting them) why do we want to find a similar criteria for ourselves or
Annie to judge open work...are those Forms forever yardsticks...what's at
stake, I guess, if Annie isn't convinced? & why do we care about convincing
her? & why is 37 lines in each of 37 stanzas or something similar, why is
that the extension of content?  Why is that not as "oppressive" a floor plan
as abbaabbaetcetc? Specifications like that, so wondrously hailed &
oft-commented, are not what makes _My Life_ brilliant or interesting to
me...& is form still "open" when those #s come into play? & is the drive to
be "open" & "poised against" Form,etc. compatible with sequences--even when
random?  How open is open? how pure is politics? then how righteous? emily

Just a note about _The Descent of Alette_: There's a review of _The
Scarlet Cabinet_ (and much about _Alette_) in the first issue of WITZ
(1.1), available for download at the EPC.  The review is by Ed Foster
(hi, Ed).  You will have to bring up the complete issue (it's not
hypertext), but anyone interested in the book might want to take a look
at what Ed has to say.  (Hint: if you want to get through all the other
articles and go directly to the review, search on the word Alette.)

I'm going to muddy up the poetics waters with commerce once more, but I
haven't noticed too many complaints from other presses doing so, so here
goes. Please DO NOT send any orders to this poetics list, rather send them
directly to me via email at chax@mtn.org, or via postal service to Chax
Press, P.O. Box 19178, Minneapolis, MN  55419-0178. And you can call at
612-721-6063.
 
These three offers, or combinations of them, are good only for orders placed
by June 10, 1996.=20
 
I.
Chax printed a small pamphlet just in time for the recent Robert Duncan
conference in Buffalo, and after selling those at the conference and to
press standing orders, we have just a few left, for $10 each plus $3
shipping & handling.
 
The pamphlet contains excerpts from three of Duncan's copy book entries. It
also contains a sentence from the copy books leading in:
 
"Mine are songs for people who cannot sing to sing."
 
and another sentence leading out of the book:
 
"The language revising its own architectures is the cloud palace and drift
of your desire."
 
 
The other excerpts are somewhat longer, and one is a poem. The entire
pamphlet is 12 pages, these pages being a combination of Gutenberg, Biblio,
and Moriki papers, hand sewn into handmade paper wrappers. All type in the
pamphlet is handset and printed letterpress in 2 colors.
 
2.
Chax has a limited number of copies of the first book produced by the press
in Tucson, Arizona, in 1984, which still carries a Black Mesa Press imprint,
Black Mesa being the press begun by Charles Alexander in 1981 in Madison,
Wisconsin. I think we had an NEA grant which included this book, so had to
use the Black Mesa imprint, even though everything else became Chax Press
upon the move to Tucson in 1984.
 
This book is hand printed on Rives lightweight paper in two colors, and
consists of twenty of Mac Low's French Sonnets. The type is Garamond from
the Golgonooza Letter Foundry, and the design is very classical. The three
signatures of the book are sewn and bound in cloth over boards. The binding
was designed by Katherine Kuehn, who currently operates the Salient Seedling
Press in Albuquerque, and was executed by Katherine and by Mary Laird, who
currently operates the Quelquefois Press in Berkeley. This book has been
selling for $65, but is currently offered to Poetics List members for $20.
 
3. Finally, Poetics List members may choose from the following list any 3
books for $5 each, a savings of up to $10 per book. a $3 shipping/handling
charge will be added for orders of 3 books; however, no shipping charge will
be added for orders totaling $20 or more, including any combination of
orders from the following list, of the Mac Low book, and of the Duncan=
 pamphlet.

have to be yes or no? Think'st thou that I'll endanger my soul _gratis_? Is
this an easy attainment? What is so important? Nietzsche? And for that reason
did the robe really cease to signify anything relative to the truth of zen?
And who's the good guys? Do you have a conscious, underlying reason that you
write? Is it only to make up a world?

Subject:      Re: quertzblatz
 
my objection to the term "quert(z)blatz" is precisely that it sounds too
germanic for my taste, being more of a romance-lingo-orientated chick myself,
and a german philologist is about the last type of guy i'd want to be
emulating.  sorry gwyn, i love the idea of a neologism to describe what,
after all, wants to neologize the language, but the Q-word isn't one that'll
creep  into my vocab anytime soon.  i like "experimental" cuz of all the nice
vowels in it.

Wait. Isnt that a kind of oxymoron? Or does it mean that the decline of
poetry is popular with people? But then that would mean that people cared
about what happens with poetry....

Since neologisms tend to congeal--to become stained by the

IIII. An exact copy of Kandinsky's *Staccato Abstract* was tattooed all

XV.  I can't read the letterhead on account of those roosters and their
querzblatz neo-Italian madrigals.
 
VV. It is no longer querzblatz to read the ingredients aloud while pouring
the [table of] contents on yourself.

Yes, and the little toy ships are much further away than they used to
be, according to Yeats, and people are now smaller and more misshapen,
and trees bear less fruit, as of 443 b.c., according to Thucydides.
 
Yes, I've heard rumors that poetry is no longer read,
just as I've heard that poetry is permanent--that,
long after the Earth is a cold black planet orbiting a
dead star, Keats will still be "immortal."
 
On the other hand, I have neighbors who read Barret Watten.

It was first used, I believe, by Joseph Conrad, the Polis novelist. You'll
see it during the explosion scene at the end of _Heart of Darkness_.

    I send this poem to explain a situation full of pain, confusion, and anger.
 
 
who killed mcduffie
(a definitive question)
 
his brain was bashed
cranium crashed
skull fractures/broken
all the way around
but they said those who beat him
didnt kill him
so who killed mcduffie?
maybe it was the ame ones
who didnt kill
clifford glover/randy heath/jay parker
claude reese/randy evans/luis baez
arturo reyes/bonita carter/ eula love elizabeth magnum/arthur miller &
countless others
when they musta tripped or
their fingers slipped
maybe it was the same ones
who didnt kill
jose torres/zayd shakur/fred & carl
hampton/jonathan & george/joe dell
twyman myers/spurgeon winters &
a few thousand others
perhaps it was those who didnt kill
lumumba/che/amilcar/biko/fanon
mondlane/marighella/cordero &
quite a few thousand more
do you suppose it may have been those
who didnt kill
the indians & mexicans
who didnt steal the land &
claim that they discovered it
who didnt steal afrikan peoples
halfway across the planet
who didnt loot our customs/cultures
religions/languages/labor/& land
who didnt bomb the japanese/
vietnamese/& boriqua too
do you think it might have been those
who didnt kill at attica/watts/dc/
detroit/newark/el barrios
at jackson state, at southern u
at the algiers motel
who didnt shoot mark essex for
16 hours after he was dead
ask them and thy'll tell you
what they didnt do
but they cant tell you
who killed mcduffie
maybe it was one of those
seizures unexplainable where he
beat himself to death
it wouldnt be unusual
our history is full of cases where we
attack nightsticks & flashlights with our heads
choke billyclubs with our throats till we die
jump in front of bullets with our backs
throw ourselves into rivers with
our hands and feet bound
and hang ourselves on trees/in prison cells
by magic
so it shouldnt be a mystery that
nobody killed mcduffie
he just died the way many of us do
of a disease nobody makes a claim to
the police say they didnt do it
the mayor says he didnt do it
the judges say they didnt do it
the gov't says it didnt do it
nixon says he didnt do it
the fbi/cia/military establishment
says they didnt do it
xerox/exxon/itt say they didnt do it
the klan & nazis say they didnt do it
(say they were busy in greensboro & wrightsville)
i know i didnt do it
that dont leave nobody but you
& if you say you didnt do it
we're back to where we started
looking for nodody
who killed mcduffie
you remember nobody dont you
like with de facto segrgation
where they said the schools were segregated
but nobody did it on purpose
loke when they said there's been
job discrimination for years
but nobody did it intentially
but nobody we're looking for
 
the one with the motive to kill mcduffie
& you see, we must find this nobody
who slew mcduffie
because the next person nobody will beat,
stomp,hang or shoot to death
wont be mcduffie
it'll be you or someone close to you
so for your own safety
you should know the pedigree of
who killed mcduffie
you should know the reason of
who killed mcduffie
and you should remember all those forgotten
who died of the disease nobody makes a claim to
so we wont be asking who killed you

There is poetry on many of my non poetry my mailing lists. And my husbands. They include wargaming, housewife, health, womens, sex, and a joke list.
 
People often quote poetry in their sigs. In the body of their mail they send topical poems they find or write, quote poetry urls, make references to poets or particular poems. Poetry is as about as unpopular as chocolate. People may say they don't dig poetry but that doesnt stop them it using it, writing it, quoting it and pointing to it.
 
I wonder is e-mail seeing a change in written correspondence which has darned gone and produced a new loquat age for poetry?
 
There is poetry right through the nonsense/humour page set as well.
 
I have just founded a poetry webring thanks to Sage Weil. If anyone is interested in becoming part of this interesting navigational setting let me know. The webrings themselves are already poetry:)
 
Amazing numbers of homepages sidle of to a poetry page at some point!

A lot of good questions here... off the top of my head, two reasons why
I have been interested sometimes in "formalities" - first, they CAN provide
resistance while writing, that brings out new things.  Second, it's a
way of communicating & challenging & absorbing what's been done before.
It's not really an ideological issue for me, it's a matter of writing.
Others have made an ideological issue out of it.  To them I would say:
yes, Olson & WCW & Pound & Whitman & others did a world-changing tremendous
thing in poetry (but not exactly a new thing in world poetry).  & yes they
are as much if not more background in my particular writing than most
more traditionally formalist poets.  But ultimately I would say:
Celan's free verse is as closed as an axe falling.  Mandelstam's tight
quatrains are as open as a hobo's daydream.  Open is closed; closed
is open.  Deal with it.  - Henry Gould

The "young guy in LA who was found assassinated" was Michael
Taylor. He had been a KPFA volunteer and was attempting to start
a micro radio station. He had indeed been working on behalf of
Mumia Abu Jamal, but even informed radical journalists in the area
believe that the killing was done by three men who knew him well
and was for "financial gain" rather than from political motives -
one of them was later caught driving his car. Conspiracy theorists
will have to go very far out into left field on this one.

This may be one of the reasons Milosz et al fear the Web -- the
medium is very democratic, even anarchistic, & anybody can publish
anything -- yes, even garbage -- which has a tendency to blend
everything together... I suspect Milosz et al like a tightly
controlled situation -- i.e., a small number of literary (paper
media) publishers with access to bookstores -- because in such a
situation they are prominently featured.

In order to do this with traditional media, you would have to spend
hundreds, even thousands of dollars on expensive books -- plus wait
weeks, months for the books to be shipped. Finding an obscure
author in the nooks & crannies alone would take an immense amount
of work. All of this -- with a robust search engine -- takes only a
few minutes on the Web...

More than a few publishers have samplers & catalogues on the web.
These include SUN & MOON PRESS (http://www.sunmoon.com/), BLACK
SPARROW (http://www.blacksparrow.com/bsg5.html), and AVEC SAMPLER
(http://www.crl.com/~creiner/syntax/sampler.html). Others are
coming online all the time...

I take it you are referring here to the PBS series THE UNITED
STATES OF POETRY. A good series -- even if it spends too much time
on the old standards: Allen Ginsberg, Amiri Baraka, Lawrence
Ferlinghetti, Jack Kerouac, Derek Walcott, Rita Dove, Joseph
Brodsky, Czeslaw Milosz -- even Lou Reed and former prez Jimmy
Carter. Nothing against any of these poets -- just that there are
hundreds of others who need the exposure (does Jimmy Carter *need*
exposure?)...

Yes, I prefer a book also... tho if you find a poem on the Web, you
can always send it to yr printer & take it with you on the bus or

Subject:      Re: a foraml Finch comes
 
Since no one seems interested in speaking up on behalf of Annie Finch,
allow me--
 
I have just gone through her book, _The Ghost of a Meter_, and her
main point, as well as many of her readings, are worth checking out.
She's not another Timothy Steele, as some people on the list seem to have
assumed. She wants to establish an understanding of metrics as a
code--it's a Sausurrian reading of how regular metrical forms signify,
or can be made to signify, by certain writers in certain conditions.
So her sense of "form" seems to have to do with how traditional forms
are made to signify as codes. It's a theoretically naive sense of
what constitutes form from the perspective of modern mathematics and
physics and their application to poetics, as a number of people have
pointed out, but it's not, I think, based on the kind of political
position that's been attributed to her.
 
Her reading of Dickinson is actually rather similar to Susan Howe's
reading, except that whereas Howe stresses the painterly aspects of
Dickinson's prosodic ruptures as signifying her resistance to
patriarchy, Finch stresses Dickinson's uses and oppositions of
metrical forms. She examines the ways Dickinson modulates between,
say, a tetrameter line and a pentameter line in the same poem, and
argues that such shifts mean something--usually having to do with
resistance to a patriarchal poetic tradition. In so far as she's
dealing with metrics as a meaningful rather than a decorative aspect
of the poem, her fundamental position is not that different from many
people on this list, although I'm sure there are major differences
over how that process is understood to take place.
 
For the record, she misquoted me in her post to Mark--I did not
say that forms exist on a continuum from regular to irregular. I was
speaking of metrics, and arguing that metrical patterns exist on such
a continuum, my main point being that the notion of non-metrical
poetry promoted most recently by Steele and Co. is nonsense, that all
poetry is metrical, i.e. measured, although we can speak meaningfully
of regular metrics and irregular metrics (what Williams called the
variable foot).

Dear PROSODY Readers,
 
As John Milton wrote in _Areopagitica_, "a good Booke is the
pretious life-blood of a master spirit, imbalm'd and treasur'd
up on purpose to a life beyond life."
 
THE MILTON TRANSCRIPTION PROJECT is dedicated to assuring that
all of Milton's poetry and prose will be available for public
access on the Internet.  Although most of Milton's poetry will
soon become available at the Oxford Text Archive and at the
University of Richmond server, most of the English and Latin
prose--along with a great deal of fascinating Miltoniana--
remains to be transcribed.  We invite you to join us in
providing accurate scholarly transcriptions of these texts.
 
THE MILTON TRANSCRIPTION PROJECT (MTP), currently supported by
Milton-L, _Milton Quarterly_, the Computer Writing and Research
Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin, _EMLS_, and the
University of Richmond's web-server, is the joint creation of
volunteers from 24 colleges and universities in three countries.
 
Volunteers may transcribe as much or as little as they wish;
each transcription will be proofread, formatted, checked, and
refereed.  We shall acknowledge any significant contribution,
and all accepted transcriptions will be credited by name.
 
In order to volunteer, to view test sites, or to receive other
information, please contact either Professor Hugh Wilson (MTP,
Editor; dithw@ttacs.ttu.edu) or Professor A.E.B. Coldiron,
(MTP, Internet Liaison; aec2b@virginia.edu).
 
The only requirements are diligence, concern for accuracy, and
the ability to type with one or more fingers.  Volunteer: earn
the intangible reward of "those whose publisht labours advance
the good of mankind" (_Areopagitica_, 1644).

Subject:      Re: Formal Continuum
 
Tom Bell raises a good question about the distinction between form and
technique.  My sense is that it's something we don't talk about enough.  Here's
what John Dewey said in "Art as Experience,"
 
"Technique is neither identical with form nor yet wholly independent of it.  It
is, properly, the skill with which the elements constituting form are managed.
Otherwise it is show-off or a virtuosity separated from expression.
 
Significant advances in technique occur, therefore, in connection with efforts
to solve problems that are not technical but that grow out of the need for new
modes of experience...."
 
As for the formal continuum debate, I don't find the idea of a continuum useful
except to the extent that it allows me to say that I think its premise is
completely wrong, which I guess makes it an idea that's wrong in all the right
ways.
 
To define poetic form from within the confines of poetry exclusively, by means
of a continuum, it seems to me, does not define form very well at all.  It's an
approach that defines by force, by fixing the institutional endpoints of praxis
as functional and universal, and then organizes the refusal to recognize
anything beyond them as normal and self-regulating, as a simple matter of
category and history.  A validation of what is found in between these agreed
"points" might resemble diversity, but it's a diversity that's preordained, not
one that is simultaneous with formal possibility.
 
The use of the term "form" without any discussion of material or other technical
factors, seems to me to be too "formal." It leaves too many aspects of
production and reception unspecified and leaves form only fit for describing
ideology.  As politics is elevated above all other concerns poetry can only
respond in kind, that is become internally politicized itself.  Once diverted by
politics it becomes incapable of responding to form in a more general way, or to
expressive opportunities outside of its historical or technical domain.
 
Arguing about who or what marks the endpoint of praxis, for me, marks little
difference.  It's still the discipline or category instituting itself.
 
I think "scene," by the way, tries to do the same thing as continuum, only on a
smaller scale.

Subject:      Re: formal continuum
 
Ward Teitz's remarks are helpful in generalizing the issues of form
rather than re-hashing politicized debates.  It raises a question
though: just how DO you focus on the place where technique & form
interact?  At one extreme you have a blindered form/content open/
closed debate, on the other a kind of wide-open quest for poetry
as a multi-art phenomenon under the influence of all kinds of
lenses, ideological, material, art-historical, etc.  Themes.
 
I know this is kind of a useless rhetorical question.  At the back
of my mind (to the left) is the idea that poetry is paradoxical
in that a great deal is going on in an extremely concentrated
reality under a rather simple unprepossessing surface.  Perhaps
the ultimate "form" poetry takes is the riddle.  And the claims &
debates that rage & ramble are carried on by people (us) who
often never enter that hidden reality, or get to the poem.
Does the concept rule the form - or is the concept multi-form,
depending on what lense we bring to the "artefact"?
(Is the concept Peirce's "thirdness"...) Or is this all

   Mike Boughn, I agree with Maria. I was not trying to demonize finch
   as to assert my lack of interest in systematic studies of form (which
   I know, you're interested in too). Maybe this will change on my part--
   but the questions of the MEANING that get attached to forms interests
   me too. What does Maria mean by this meaning, meaning as value?
   Since I read both "traditional" and "non-traditional" (i'm not defining
   that now) verse (in terms of "form"), I guess I'm curious what form
   attracts me and why. But I guess I feel that "meaning" tends to get
   pushed aside, in such discussions. As if the meaning of the form matters
   more than the meaning on a more content level. If I see the MEANING
   of say a Berrigan poem as similar to the meaning of a Shakespeare sonnet
   (and i don't mean a SINGULAR meaning, but a kind of meaning-complex),
   am I being a bad boy who has not eaten enough of my post-modern peas
   and recognized how IMPORTANT the formal differences are in the fashion-
   show of life? cs

Dear Rod,

Re:  Replies to the post on the formal continuum:
 
A dozen replies are waiting on the server in my office an hour from home and
I
can't acess fthem until next week.  But I have seen a couple fo the
latest--and
the subject haeadings--so I have some idea, i think, fo what the resposne has
been.  And I just wanted to throw into the mix the thought that my idea of
formalism--my love for sensual repetition in poetry, and my interest in
celebratingcc
elerating it in books like the anthology in question--has nothign to do with
political conservatism (I saw timothy Steele's name mentioned in this
context).
 First, ther eis no connection between formal proclivities nad political
ones,
or else fascist Pound  and antisemite Eliot would have written sonnets while
radical Millay would have written the Cantos. Check out Adrienne Rich's essay
 
Format and Form in her new book of essays for more on this common
misperception. Also, my own interst in form is based if anything on a sense
of
he democratic potential of oral poetries, and appreciation for the
universal/communal roots of the art in tribal poetics.  I am not personally a
conservative in the least.  ANd of course, I am personally tired of having it
assumed that because I love formal poetry I am some kind of reactionary in my
personal life. My main point though is that I wish we could begin to discuss
some kind of common overall map of how poetics works, without panic based on
political factions/fractions.
My own poetry started out in freee verse, and when  noticed the coded
meanings
in my occasional unintentional metrical riffs, I wanted to mistress meter and
find out how to control it better. That led to learning to wrtie in form,
enjoyhing it,a nd to the idea of the metrical codes explained in THE GHOST OF
METER.  Ghost of Meter in turn led me to realize that as a fefminist I wanted
to write in other meters, and I am now writing in metetrs that have not been
seriously explored before, to wit in dactyls.  These are regular meters, with
a
regular rhythm. But they are plenty challenging to me as I learn how to vary
them and make them live.  THey defamiliarize language and rid me of the need
to
put an ego-subject in the middle of the poem. i enjoy them.
But his is not for politically reactionary nrreasons; if i waqnt to go back,
it
is about 10,00 years back, not back to the ighteenth century as some

Discussions of form are *usually* too unspecified. Why is that?
 
In classical (and quertzblatz) music composition, discussions of
form are almost always on the level of formal construction.
The absence of terms, I think, is what makes formal discussions
in music so like a classical argument in which the terms are unknown.
I'd like to see more of that in discussions of the poetry of our peers--
especially in discussions of so-called experimental poetry.
 
The ideological aspect of form seems to me to be form's least
interesting aspect. Certainly, attempts to right ideological flaws
by means of formal innovation have created important approaches
to form and technique--for example, Cage's chance operations, which
were often created in an attempt to avoid intrusions of "the ego."
But in arbitrary cases, there is also the danger of losing the
initial impulse that leads to the occurrence of the poem. In the service
of some self-conscious attempt to posit opposing or utopian takes on
politics, many poets seem obsessed with writing prosodic PC models--
colloquial models to make the poem more "real," appropriations of street
art to somehow avoid the artificiality of language (an impossibility).
People often argue against formal Eurocentrism--as if Afrocentric forms
were a priori better (or worse). I would argue that the *properties* of
a poem--its idiomatic (not ideological) event, is resonance--are what
make the poem work. Sometimes, the wish to avoid the obvious is the
only doctrine, the only belief system, that a writer needs.

Among other things, metrics are certainly a kind of code. The mere fact
that a work might involve metrical patterns that might play against the
content (line breaks, metrics that foreground the weaknesses and disloca-
tions of syntax) suggests that there is a kind of pun, a duality, involved
in metrical considerations. The most obvious examples might well be
medieval--metaphysical shape poetry; medieval music by Machaut, which
was sometimes written "in the shape of" the architecture of the
cathedral in which it was to be performed; *musica ficta*--musical notes
in a code that usurped the notes as written; *augenmusic*
(music for the eye, ie, notation that drew pictures on the page);
the parody mass, which sometimes encoded popular songs in an almost
unrecognizable cantus firmus. I might argue that all sonically-based
technique can be considered as a kind of code.
 
The tricky part comes when one attempts to affix meanings to the
*terms* of the code. I might argue that meter is a kind of non-functional,
non-representational cryptography. The sound of language might have
*originated* through a misguided attempt to represent, but ontomatopoeia
retains an endearing artificiality. When sound-patterns repeat, the
meaning often grows progressively more opaque. Laugherino, laugherino...
 
In Julius Caesar, Shakespeare employs a rhetorical device that
seems relevant: He uses the phrase "honorable men" repeatedly until
the term begines to mean its opposite, and an angry crowd goes away in
search of the "honorable" men they later kill. Could this be an example
of how rhythm can be used to provide a counterpoint to poetic meaning?

The resistance of ED's modulation/vacillation between meters *does*
mean something. But I fail to see how any patriarchy is involved.
Mallarme and Hopkins were resisting conventional metrics as well.
There is no secret, pervasive conspiracy of straight white males
formed to keep poetry metrical, just as jews are not responsible
for the economic state of the world.
 
BTW: I do not accept the idea that the Canon is such a "conspiracy"
of straight white males.

So poetry would seem to be to me--though I am speaking from the perspective
of a musician as well as a writer. No matter what style or period, poetry--
indeed, all writing, including prose--seems to scan as rhythmically as sheet
music: everything still breaks down to two's and three's. Is this some sort
of literal-minded failing on my part as a reader? Possibly--but I'm inclined
to think otherwise. To me, it seems a failing on the reader's part *not*
to hear music when s/he reads--unless there has been a conscious rejection
of sound in poetry on reader and writer's part. (The idea is interesting,
though, and has already lead to some fascinating work.)

If my "profs" (whoever these nebulous strangers
might be) either "think" they're speaking from a platform
of objectivity or are "fooling themselves," then it
follows that my profs must either:
 
1. merely imagine they are speaking from a platform of objectivity
   (in which case, they would seem to be incorrect according to the
   terms of your question), or
 
2. are certain they speak from a platform of objectivity
  (in which case, they would seem to be correct according
   to the terms of your question).
 
An interesting idea, but a strange one...

You would have to ask the writer. Otherwise, how could you
presume to know what s/he means merely by listening to the tone?

Re John Cage and chance operation:
 
In 1982 in London there was a major 70th birthday festival given
for Cage. It included two whole afternoons in which his music was
performed without formal breaks, consecutively and simultaneously.
Many of the same musicians took part. The structures of both were
determined by chance operations governed by the I Ching. The first
event was planned by one of the organizers, the second by Cage
himself.
 
The first afternoon was dreary beyond description. 4'33" seemed
like 4hrs33'. The second afternoon went by in a flash. Everyone was
constantly laughing and applauding. Never had four hours gone so

just a quick semantic point:
 
 - "formal" means *starting* with a predetermined form, in my book
 - not all shapes are forms, that would extend the definition of the word
beyond all use
 - many modernists sought "new forms" rather than an end to form (Spring
and All)
 - "open form" is a form because it can be seen as a reflection of one of
the current models of the universe
 - there is often more structure in an "open form" piece that in any formal
poem I have ever seen

Actually I meant "code" in a more strictly structuralist sense. This
is what she says: ". . . the metrical-code theory concentrates on the
information value of specific occurences of metrical patterns within a
poem. The word _code_ implies that meter in a metrically organic poem
can function like a language, carrying different information at
different points within a poem. . . . metrical associations create
their own layer of literary meaning as they develop throughout a poem."
 
Metrical "meaning", according to this theory, is generated through
difference within a structure--an obvious reference to Saussure. As I
said, it's an interesting way of looking at what certain poets have
done in certain circumstances, a different way of reading the
meaningfulness of meter.
 
As for E. Dickinson and patriarchy, read Finch's argument. I never
meant to become an apologist for her. I just wanted to correct what in
my sleep-deprived state (damn those 2 a.m. feedings!) seemed to me a
somewhat knee-jerk response by _some_ people to her brand of
formalism. If my tone seemed shrill, I apologize.
 
But here's one for you.  What's the difference between "rules" and
"conventions"? I just read an essay by Peter Burger in his collection
called _The Decline of Modernism" (I don't have it here--it's 3 floors
down--and can't remember the name of the essay and have Amelia
sleeping finally in one arm as I type this and am not going to go down
to the kitchen for it and risk waking her up--just to reintroduce the
"body" here) in which he argues that one of the
differnces, or points of modulation in the development of modernism
(the transition from the 18th to the 19th century, from the
Enlightenment to Romanticism) was the shift in poetic composition from
rules to conventions and the different way that positioned the writer
socially and as an "artist".

M. Boughn's & A. Finch's recent posts maybe answered my question of
yesterday re: W. Teitz's message: how to focus more precisely on where
form & technique conjoin.  The focus on metrics & measure might lead
into the internal structure, where all the effects take place.
It's not that ideology & background are not important - it's that
they excuse a superficial reading or a non-reading.  Meter is famously
hard to read & hard to agree on - thus the dearth of comments on it
here & elsewhere, I suppose - but to listen to it (along with all the
other halting stuttering slowdown effects of poetry) might lead to the

A group of Nobel Prize winning poets has declared that
cyberspace
no place for serious verse, according to Reuters.  Asked
if
the
use of the Internet was one way to reverse the low popular
appeal
of poetry, the group said no.  Poets Derek Walcott, Octovio
paz,
and Czeslaw Milosz were undaunted about the current dearth
of
readers.  Walcott stated that "I'd rather have just one
person
who reads and feels my work deeply than hundreds of
thousands
who
read it but don't really care about it."  Milosz allowed
that
mputers were useful incomposition, but was skeptical
that lovers
 serious poetry would look for it on the Internet.
yeah well, "seriouous" somea this Csezlaw
cereal poetry on the cornflakes box made me what I am today
"I read you, chaise-lounge, but i don't really care about you..."
What I care about is demonstrating outside my window this morning
enty thousand lilac blossoms excercizing their rites
exotica of the navel tickle the holy grails
for smart bombs.  Don't believe a word of it
sparse gleanings from the ivoried groves of academ
and don't forget those of us who have a visceral reaction to
triumph of the human spirit stuff such as milosz and walcott churn
out--our viscerae get bored.

If there is blinding meaning

What is the issue is a little power,
A very little power,
To resist almost successfully
Our disappearance. Imagine

Gab -- the story is still up in air, mysterious, etc -- young guy in
question is former street person who'd gotten involved in broadcast
journalism thru the Pacifica station here & its programs -- yes, he'd
been coveing AMJ story, along with many others -- small story in LA
Times, and some coverage in LA Sentinel (Local black paper) but true
motive for murder of this young man still not known -- I'd suggest a
phone call to KPFK or to Pacifica near you as possible place to begin if
you're looking for info about this tragic murder --

Or renga viewer, or whatever.
 
Uhhm, I know that summer's coming up, the season for mailbox filling
"renga", but, erm, wasn't there a decision by consensus of the list to
circulate these collectively created poems privately during the composition
period & post some of the completed pieces to the entire list.
 
Rather than, say, take over everyone's mailboxes with screen after screen
of growing columns of left hand carets.
 
At issue here is not the quality of the work, but the quantity of the process.
 
Those who are new to the list since last fall may find this attitude
unnecessarily harsh.  If so, I suggest that you search the Poetics-List
archives <http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive/> for the word
"renga" to get a fuller sense of the previous instance of this kind of
thing & the discussion about it.

From Cage. It was late 80s I believe. Messiaen improvised on a cathedral
organ in France. I don't think John changed his mind abt jazz improvisation,
but w/ the number pieces he admits (or at least he saw it this way) or gives
permission for improvisation in a way he hadn't
previously. He may talk abt this in an interview somewhere as well. I'll see
if I can find a cite for you, if you have Retallack's _MUSICAGE_ it might be
in there.

Cage certainly allowed for improvisation within the established
parameters of the Four Songs he wrote for Electric Phoenix (SATB
quartet plus electronics). He attended our first rehearsal at my
studio in London and gave his approval to our rather free-wheeling
approach; his only caveat was that the singers shouldn't listen to
each other. His droll recognition of the groups' character was
contained in his final note of instruction: "A virtuosic performance
is invited." He got it!

Subject:      musica ficta
 
Thought you might find this of interest.
 
My response to Jordan's thoughtful note on musica ficta, in which
he mentioned that his Grove Dictionary defined musica ficta as
the use of 'wrong notes' or unacceptable intervals--noncanonical
intervals forbidden by the Church:
 
As someone who was actually taught musicology by nuns (simper), I must
explain that both the _Grove Dictionary of Music_ (not as reliable as
Apel's _The Harvard Dictionary of Music_ and Grout's _A Concise History
of Western Music_, both of which are entirely by scholars with intensive
musical backgrounds) and my own description of Musica Ficta are correct.
 
Certainly, forbidden intervals--"wrong-notes" as a technique applies more
to Prokofiev than to medieval music--were encoded in musica ficta. But
these were not necessarily incorrect, nor was this the only kind of
musical information encoded in musica ficta. For example, certain
cadences that were commonly understood to contain accidentals (such
as the Landini Cadence, named after a composer who used it frequently)
would not be notated as such, since musicians were presumed to know
the proper voicing to sing or to play. This kind of Cabalistic encoding
of presumed knowledge also reminds me of the figured bass in baroque music,
and which all composition and theory students are required to learn.
In this light, _Gradus ad Parnassum_ can be seen as a kind of magical
treatise. Finally, the omissions and reinterpretaions in jazz notation,
such as the substitution of swing time for normal eighth notes, and the
reification of diminished and half-diminished symbols in jazz chord
notation--to say nothing of the voicings and soloing techniques one is
presumed to know before even opening a fake book--contain a hidden
system of knowledge and notation. In music, one frequently does a double-
take when looking at a composition, looking for what is hidden in the
purely abstract sense. So too, I think, do formal considerations in
poetry--especially my favorite poetry--hinge on such dualities of
referents and abstract codes:--and I mean *coding* literally--not in
the linguistic sense of a set of conventions for converting one signal-
ling system into another. To avoid confusion, maybe it is time for
another neologism--*musicacrypta*, perhaps.
 
> --all that best,
 
Errata: Rereading my post, I see that I grouped the metaphysicals in
with medieval work.  Obviously, the metaphysical poets, who occasionally
wrote pattern-poetry, such as George Herbert (1593-1633), are from
the seventeenth century rather than the medieval period. I was thinking
of the fourteenth century "Musical Heart"--a musical composition written
in the shape of a heart--and forgot my chronological head. Play it,
Thelonius...

No, no, Alan, Polis is what it says on the side of a cop car in Germany. I
knew a cop who was writing a novel in one, on duty. Called the _Art of
Dorkness_, all about people being hounded for committing the German crime
of Qwertz-Blasm.

Subject:      Re: musica ficta
Comments: To: Carnography <scrypt@INTERPORT.NET>
 
Rob Hardin's concise and thoroughly reliable summary of musica
ficta (corresponding to my own memories of Edward Lowinsky's
lectures at UC Berkeley), clicks on a hypertext connection with
John Eliot Gardiner's recent publicizing of research which reveals
that a number of Beethoven's most familiar symphonic themes were
taken from French revolutionary composers. While the press
sniggered about plaigarism, Gardiner's own excellent program on
the South Bank Show (London Weekend TV) made it clear that this
was a "Masonic handshake" to the cognoscienti in which his
sympathies were communicated under the very noses of the censors.
 
Such considerations are central to all discussions of form. Forms
can be mysteries which are intended to be revealed to some but
concealed from others, often as a defense against oppressive regimes.
They presuppose an interlocking sequence of learned traditions which
extend further back in time than mere nostalgia for the day before
yesterday. At the simplest level, they impel us to stand up (or sit
down!) for the National Anthem; at their most complex they beckon us
to life-long journeys through the Cantos or the Maximus Poems.
 
In America, such cultural continuity has been undermined by two
factors (among others): relative freedom of speech such that, except
among compulsive conspirators, it is unnecessary to speak in code; and
the advertising-impelled convention that no communication should
require even a moment's reflection in order to understand it.

Words are like buffalo.
They will not be hurried, but instead
Lumber along at their own pace,
Tepid beasts at best.
 
They loom darkly and smell of mud and blackwater and stay
Hidden behind rheumy eyes.
They wallow in filth, blocking progress, and
None can guess their intent.
 
They will go where they will.
They crop from the gardens of all the world, and make them
Fertile with their leavings.
 
They level the earth.
They surge and cannot be dammed from
Where their need is sweetest.
Shrouding horizons in vagueness,
They grow plump and vast and portentous.
 
They are perfect keepers of secrets.
 
You cannot force them home; they must
Roam the parched fields where they belong to nobody.
Come sundown, they will amble back through the mist
To nuzzle you urgently in your dung-caked hut
And shape your dreams.

Mike,
 
Could you talk more about Burger's sense of "rules & conventios"? Does he
mean rules re something one either obey or break & conventions are what one
"plays" with? Or what?
 
<<What's the difference between "rules" and
"conventions"? I just read an essay by Peter Burger in his collection
called _The Decline of Modernism"  ... in which he argues that one of the
differnces, or points of modulation in the development of modernism
(the transition from the 18th to the 19th century, from the
Enlightenment to Romanticism) was the shift in poetic composition from
rules to conventions and the different way that positioned the writer
socially and as an "artist".>>

Subject:      Will Alexander's work
 
I've been reading Will Alexander's Asia & Haiti with great pleasure,
and have a couple of questions.
 
The first has to do with a primary device of his, which for want of a
better phrase I want to call "controlled overwriting." His work (and
not just this book, but everything I've ever seen by him) is with dense
contradictory phrases on the order of
 
"in this primeval penumbra
in this heightened verdigris scarlet
in this incisive analogical omniscience"
 
In this almost logorheaic excess (a pleonast's plenitude), particularly
given the long and open nature of the texts, I at moments sense a kind
of deja vu echo of Frank Stanford's old "the battlefield where the moon
says i love you" (Lost Roads/Mill Mountain, 1977), an American
surrealist classic that is ultimately a very raw text by a very young
writer. But Alexander is neither raw nor young and it's apparent he
revises (at least one of the footnotes for page 12, for example, seems
to refer to an earlier stage of the text).
 
If most of us tried this kind of cumulative effect even in a first
creative writing course (and maybe especially there), we'd get shot
down pretty fast. So I want to know what it is about Alexander's use of
it that makes it so effective, even riveting.
 
My second question is for someone like Walter Lew, say, who might find
the adoption of the collective "we" and dense use of stereotypes. I
know that I cringe at the undifferentiated use of a term like Marxists,
as in
 
"these drab & scaly Marxists"
or, later
"here was Marx
here was the State"
which profoundly fails to grasp the anti-statist impulse that runs
throughout Marx's own work (tho not that of Lenin and his followers,
say)
 
So how does this level of generalization play out racially, esp. when
the author is an African American who is obviously brilliant and knows
what he's doing?
 
Just asking....

can't believe in some of the very rapid mechanical sounding playing

articulatory freedoms of various kinds. Dinah Washington shd have

never, the notation always underdetermines the performances,
always, and the (somewhat) mechanical-sounding rhythms one
might find in Toscanini or Hogwood are as much a product of
interpretation as the highly articulated performances of Fischer
or Leonhardt. (and they are not so mechanical either,
especially Toscanini's. on the inadequacy of the "literalist"
interpretation of Toscanini's performances, and the role of
literalism in p-r puffery, see Horowitz _Understanding
Toscanini_)
 
the best recent writings on performance practice, to my taste,
are those of Richard Taruskin, gathered in a recent collection
from California. among other things RT argues, convincingly I
think, that the rigid "text-oriented" style of performance is a
manifestation of early-20th-c modernist taste.

I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but I do agree.
In classical music performance, interpretation is far less
strict than people imagine. Learning a piece of music and
then hearing it played by someone else is rather like burning
some beloved poem into the memory, only to discover that the
the very rhythms and sonic properties you'd presumed were
intrinsic to everyone's interpretation--most of all the
author's--might prove the overlay of your very own ear.

I'm not convinced *yet*, but I'd like to be persuaded.
Do you have the title and publisher of the book? If so,
tell us. Perhaps we can discuss it.
 
However: being "text-oriented" is hardly a side-effect of
modernism. If so, what was Thomas Campion? (And yes, I do see that
you've qualified "text-oriented" with quotes and the adjective
"rigid.")
 
And for the record: In important ways, musica ficta was as
score-specific as Beethoven. Dynamic and phrase markings didn't
exist yet, but rhythms and notes were written as they are today.
 
All the best,
 
Rob Hardin

Subject:      Re: Will Alexander's work
 
   I am very glad that Ron has brought up Will Alexander for consideration
   here. Though I haven't read ASIA AND HAITI in over a year (I remember
   finding ASIA more engaging than HAITI; and I also tend to prefer other
   shorter work of Will's better--such as "Being As Neutrality And Drift"
   but I digress),and I'm having a hard time finding my notes on it....
   Actually, a question for RON--What PAGE is the line about the PENUMBRA
   from---because context may matter in terms of the question you ask about
   whether he contradicts himself, and on what level, etc. For, my memory
   of ASIA (which I think that passage is from) was that despite the "us"
   vs. "them" frame device, these contradictions are really complications
   that deal as much with the "internal" enemy. But, again, I want to see
   the context of the lines you quoted.
   Perhaps this goes towards answering the MARXIST question.
   I think that regardless of Alexander's general views of Marxism, the
   historical specificity of the poem allows him to get away with such
   generalizations because it is being spoken by, and/or through (the
   p.o.v. goes back and forth between Alexander and the monks), these
   beings persecuted by MAOISTS who did invoke MARX.
   For instance, if I were to write a poem attacking CHRISTIAN HYPOCRISY
   that wouldn't necessarily be attacking christ (say Sinead O'Connor
   pope picture incident).
   For me the problem is not so much Alexander's reduction of Marx as it
   is the Maoist's misapplication of same Marx....

Ron?   Are those by any chance rhetorical questions? because, don't they

wrong?  You, of course, don't expect an answer from me, do you? because,
what could I possibly say about such intentionally contradictory lines

BUT -- (I don't have answers bevause I haven;t thought even about the
questions yet, this being one problem, for me, of such e-mail, that I
write a response before I've thought carefully about what's been said!) --
 
There IS, I think, a very interesting recption question here, as
Alexander was indeed dinged, blasted, rejected, etc. for years, during
which time _Hambone_ was one of the very few places he could get
published -- & now seemingly suddenly folks are calling himn up for
manuscripts & rushing to his defense in the _American Book Review_  --
claiming his work for their own very contradictory purposes (are
Weinberger and Noto reading the same Will Alexander -- and how about the
way they read him at the _Apex of the M_, which certainly ain't the way
he's read over at _Sulfur_, undsoweiter,,, and none of these folk seem to
have read that earlier book from Jazz press,, but I DO think it's a
reception question 'cause as you so rightly point out, the writing itself
has not changed that much, just the reading of it $($*$
 
so, what ARE the right answers to those questions anyway --

tho to be just one shade more srious about Ron's questions --
 
I think any useful answers to the latter will have to account for the
fact that hte line about "Marxists" is spolen by a "collective voice of
rebellious monks" from a "focal point of anti-Chinese feeling" -- That
is, we can still talk about what Alexander is up to in these lines, but
we have to begin by looking at the rhetorical context OF the lines, their
status as lines spoken by fictive characters --

Yes, Bob, saw that review--was amazed at his cogent words on many of the
pieces, esp. Sparrow's wonderful vivid piece and old god-daddy Ginsberg,
and his ability to make subtle distinctions between artists like Leonard
Cohen and Lou Reed. Of course you could debate until eternity what it
*means* to be "more a poet than a musician" or vice versa--how he
characterized Cohen and Reed, respectively--but it's nice to see that
level of skilled attention being paid to perf-po in the Times.

_Text and Act_ from Oxford U P (not California, which has

can commend this as a brilliant book without endorsing

Hmm? I thought the point about ficta was that some of the notes
are *not* written the same way: to us it looks like one pitch,
but the intended sound is a half step away from what we might
think.

A fake book is a compilation of lead sheets for popular or standard songs
that band members at casuals (gigs like weddings at which the band members
may not have ever played together before, let alone rehearsed a particular
repertoire) or at bars where you never know what song someone will request.
It's "fake" because it provides enough information to fake your way
through the tune without rehearsal or prior knowledge of the tune.
 
There's been a subsequent publication, called the real book, that is used
in the same way, but instead of being photocopied (technically illegally)
is an actual offset published book for which the composer royalties have
been paid.
 
Many players still use fake books, though, cause the real book, because it
has paid royalties, has only a limited selection & isn't as comprehensive,
or idiosyncratic, as the usual fake book.

From my earliest memories of playing with the conveniently-named
Thara Memory to my last jazz performance with members of the Cecil
Taylor Ensemble (or whatever they were called), I noticed that
musicians' references to fake books were always made in the context
of "faking it"--ie, of playing the head, improvising over the changes,
playing the head again and then going to the tag. Obviously, certain
tunes in fake books are through-composed (no repeating sections, no
improv in the stricter sense). But fake books are usually comprised
of melodies and chord symbols rather than complete arrangements--hence
the term.
 
The most famous fake book is the one that issues from The Berkeley
School of Music, which is called The Real Book. In it, one finds
more elaborate arrangements than is usually the case. But if there
weren't room in the Real Book for "faking it"--a witty, self-
deprecating term for the ability to extemporize if ever I heard one--
then we probably wouldn't think of it as jazz.
 
Can you think of anything approximating a fake book in poetry?
If so, tell us. This is pertinent to the subject of poetic notation.

Yes, you are correct in stating that in musica ficta, certain
notes are not played as written. But the written notes still suggest
exact raised and lowered pitches, hence the music is still score-
specific. If medieval musicians had been allowed allowed to *improvise
on the idea* of raising and lowering notes, we might find less score-
specific processes in effect.
 
However, there *is* real improvisation in the baroque period,
both in practice (we read about the public riffing of Bach and
others) and in notated form (realizations of the figured bass).
 
Still: there was a kind of conceptual improvisation in late
medieval music that fascinates me: the mensuration canons
of Ockeghem, for example, and his mass that was written to be
performed in any key.
 
What might the parallel be in writing? A play that could either
be performed as a tragedy or a farce? A multicultural discovering-my-
identity poem that could be read from the point of a person from
any race, gender, religious or sexual orientation? A descriptive poem
in which all nouns and verbs can be transposed?

Cause (even in performance poetry situations) people rarely ask an artist
to do a poem that isn't their own, the issue is pretty different.
 
In the few cases when someone does interpret the work of another, there's
less leeway than is usually the case for a musician.  I mean, if someone
asked for, say, Frank O'Hara's "In Memory of My Feelings" they probably
wouldn't be satisfied with something that had the broad formal outline
correct, but which had some different words.  Even when the words are all
correct, there's often a sense that a performance that strays from that of
the original poet's is not "right."
 
The only example that I can think of in poetry like a fake book are the
various dictionaries of poetic forms that describe how many lines of how
many syllables stressed in what ways etc. make up a pantoum or an
alexandrine or a whatever.
 
But these aren't guides for recreating a specific work, rather for creating
something in a more general form.

An intriguing paradox indeed, and not only to us. Notated chance
operations hinge on the paradox mentioned here.

I don't think I've ever peformed in public without finding
at least one problem in the score. Aren't textual inaccuracies
part of *being* a performer--indeterminacy in everyday life?

Meaning that the book *itself* was fake! Touche--nice insight.

Amusingly, I do remember conversations in which Berkeley graduates
(not neophytes) attributed biblical authority to the Real Book.
To impose pedantry on aural tradition *in the middle of a gig*
has always struck me as a rather impractical activity.
 
Such second-hand arrogance is one of the reasons I stopped playing
jazz in public. Since I grew up playing and composing classical music,
I reasoned, let those who truly grew up with the jazz tradition get
props for doing it. Hence, people should go to Matthew Shipp to hear
jazz piano and not to me. As unpopular as this sounds, I improvise
from harmonic/contrapuntal traditions that are primarily European
and non-Afrocentric (though of course the lines are blurred) in
origin. To do otherwise strikes me as dishonest. I'm not
interested in becoming the Vanilla Ice (rather than the
3rd Bass) of swing.
 
But back to _The Real Book_:
 
Interestingly, I don't recall the level of error found by Mr. Morse.
Pieces by Towner, Methaney, Steve Swallow (and so on) were often
transcribed by the composers themselves. But perhaps many of the
mistakes of which he speaks had been ironed out by the early eighties,
when I came in contact with the book. I never bought it, though,
because I was preoccupied with studies at New England C to think
about BSM.
 
Incidentally: Anyone who's read my interview in the cyberpunk
issue of Keyboard (May '89) will probably deduce that--merely
in terms of knowledge and experience--I'm not a "neophyte."
Still, the use of such labels is yet another aspect of the
academicized jazz community that disturbs me. I rather
enjoy the presence of neophytes in any artistic community.
For me, the problem is not the neophyte. It is the instant
expert.
 
In the words of Montaigne, "What do I know?"
 
------------------------
 
I've typed and deleted this question a few times in my last five
posts, but now I think it's time to leave it stet.: Is all this
music-specific talk germaine to the Poetics discussion group?
I worry about dragging other poets off-topic. I'd feel better
about this if we could bring our ideas on music notation back
to the topic of *poetic* notation.
 
But I do find it helpful to interpret poetry as written music
and instrumental music in prosodic terms. Here is another paradox:
Although it is useful to frame studies of the arts in interdisciplinary
contexts, the benefits of such studies can prove idiomatic to either art.

I was speaking not only of a collection of poems to be read aloud
(any anthology could be a fake book in this context), but also
a collection of poems on which to *improvise*. I think it would
be fun to do such a collection, don't you? Professor Larry McCaffery
of SDSU is already working on a few "cover album" (ie, pastiche)
anthologies inspired by Hal Wilner. I would enjoy asking poets
from all traditions and disciplines to write texts with im/explicit
openings for improvisation.

Not necessarily. Not always. Some people are far better at composing
than performing. Shouldn't these people be read aloud by others?
Aside from being an excellent  poet, Bruce Andrews is also an
exceptionally good and versatile performer. It might be revelatory
and amusing to hear him recite other people's work, don't you think?

As someone trained in lit but working in music I've been
fascinated by the direction which this thread has taken. Are we
again entering an age in which the poetry/music distinction is
as impossible as with the English madrigalists whom Pound so
revered? After working for years with Bob Cobbing and Clive
Fencott in an improvised sound poetry/electronics ensemble
called Oral Complex, I now find myself improvisingly similarly
with John Kenney, a great trombonist with whom the interactivity
is totally analogous.

A quasi analog to musical fake books is perhaps the old english manuscripts
that showed the full elaboration of a stanza pattern including the refrain
and any other repeating features, and then showed the other unique lines
of successive stanzas--all done to save parchment that was precious.
So how would this be fake? I don't know. Of course, thinking of
parchment, one can't help but recall the whole delicious issue of
the palimpsest--but now, we are perhaps straying beyond prosody and into
purely textual/linguistic and/or philosophical matters.

    Dear Herb Levy--
    That you mentioned O'Hara's "In Memory..." as an example for the
    "interpretation" question (music/poetry analogy) pricked up my ears.
    I'm genuinely curious about how you perceive the parameters of
    "interpretation" for surely they are wider than (was it?) Rob Hardin's
    more strict analogy (where say one poet with a distinctive reading style
    --say Andrews--"interprets" O'Hara, but of course then the locus of
    comparison would be not O'Hara's writing but O'hara's performance of the
    same poem--Are their tapes of him reading it?). It seems to me that
    you're more onto the idea of reading as a collaborative act, of
    writing-while-reading as an interpretation, and I think of Pound's
    "diluters" but also Bloom's idea that the only "strong" criticism or
    interpretation of a poem must itself be another poet (and of course
    trying to claim that his form of criticism may BE a poem). Thus, there
    is no end to interpretation. And thus, there is no "original" poem
    per se (or the dreaded "lost original" as Shapiro interprets it--or
    Sappho). And the two senses of interpretation interact in complex
    ways. From one perspective, poems (ALL POEMS) can not help but be
    interpretations, yet in being interpretations of interpretations (i.e.
    conventions), self consciously, as O'Hara's poem-suite is, they attempt
    to cancel out the hyperontological, mere similacrum, to bring one to
    the illusion of "the thing itself." (Now, I'm thinking of Benjamin's
    "task of the translator" here--translator as poet-interpreter).
    Anyway, is there a way to tie any of this into Rod Smith's recent
    "IN MEMORY OF MY THEORIES" (or as a friend called it "In MEMORY OF MY
    O BOOK)?
    For instance, the marker is there (just as in Ray Ragosta's William
    James title), and could send a scholarly interpreter/explicator towards
    looking for similarities between the two books, as if there was some
    REASON, beside a spur-of the moment flash, or a flash that occured
    repeatedly more than once, that Smith called his book such. Though part
    of me (or one of my selves, as O'Hara would have it) wants to say,
    "No, Chris, it is absolutely a wild goose chase to see Smith's book
    as an interpretation of O'Hara" (or to take Perelman's O'hara meets
    Barthes in heaven as anything but a high joke to get the goat of
    academic drudges---for as Shapiro writes, "a title is not a can opener"),
    another one of my selves feels that even stale conventions such as a
    comparison/contrast mode can be a starting point for new possibilities.
    (though not "new" vs. "old" in possibility....)

Chris--
Re 'theories'--
What if Rod's borrowing of O'Hara's title is meant to compare O'Hara's
times with these times?
Think of how the word 'feelings' sounded to you before you knew the O'Hara poem.
I wasn't alive when the poem was written, so I don't know how the
pre-Feliciano environment heard it, but I suspect 'feelings' was a word of
dangerous purple.
Now. Rod's book (Rod--you want to jump in here?) is titled after a poem,
yes? The poem in which Al Gore is conflated with both Paul Simons? And a
cheerleader coaxes us to spell out "VLUH!"? I think Rod's goofing on the
word 'theories' to make it possible to take that word seriously again.
Cough. Really. Or hear it, anyway, as the abused center of our times (inner
city of meaning?). It's risky for the reasons you cite and joke about. That
kind of risk is interesting, tho, right?

That was only one of my points, and certainly not one of my own analogies.
I was arguing in favor of (as opposed to Herb's argument against) others
besides the poet interpreting the poet's work. The subject was more his
than mine. If you presumed that guest recitations were the point of my
reply, then I hope you'll reexamine what I wrote.
 
I choose to be open to the idea of interpretation in the context
of the work of other poets. If you dislike anyone's interpretation,
or *version* (which can mean any number of compositional/performance
techniques) of a particular work, you can always go back to the
original poem and poet. And it is unfair to compare all interpretative
work suggested by me--aleatoric, satirical, even ultra-rationalist--
with pedestrian interpretation; with a CD of Kevin Costner
reading e. e. cummings.

I like Harold Bloom's idea of poetic misreading. But why should I take
his word for it and denounce the reader's interpretation as mere
undigested influence? I can't presume to know the level of every
reader's interpretation.
 
(Besides, who said we weren't talking primarily about other poets?)
 
And why shouldn't a poet or reader approach influence and interpretation
from any angle that works for him/her on a practical level?

This is a useful idea, certainly. But it would seem to me to be one long
footnoted paraphrase of Foucault's essay, "what is an author?" (1969),
which is a useful work, but--again--doesn't contain the only useful
ideas for a practicing poet. At this point, decon is still important,
but it is also familiar news (or seems so to me).
 
All best always,

Charles:
 
The essay is called "Literary Institution and Modernization" and it's
conncerned to track changes in the the relation of literature to its
producers and consumers (and to the social generally) during the
transition to modernism. Burger proposes that the production of
literature is governed by rules during (and preceding) neo-classicism
when the institution of literature is part of a stable social order
within which artists peacefully exist.
 
Within the Enlightenment, the _doctrine classique_ is replaced by the
aesthetics of autonomy. "The bourgeois subject, claiming personal
autonomy, and being itself a result of modernization, opposes society
as an alien object. The critique which has been concerned with
traditional residues, such as dogmatic systems of belief, can now turn
against modernization itself." Simultaneously, rules give way to
conventions as the mode of organizing literary production. Rules are
either on or off, whereas conventions evolve and change and become deformed.
 
So I'm wondering how to characterize our situation now? Are we still,
as poets, in a conventional mode? Is this giving way to something new,
like, say, procedures? Can we even know that?
 
Maybe this is boring to people on the list, but it seemed relevant to
the discussion that Annie Finch gave rise to.

Amusingly, I do remember conversations in which Berkeley graduates
(not neophytes) attributed biblical authority to the Real Book.
To impose pedantry on aural tradition *in the middle of a gig*
has always struck me as a rather impractical activity.
 
Such second-hand arrogance is one of the reasons I stopped playing
jazz in public. Since I grew up playing and composing classical music,
I reasoned, let those who truly grew up with the jazz tradition get
props for doing it. Hence, people should go to Matthew Shipp to hear
jazz piano and not to me. As unpopular as this sounds, I improvise
from harmonic/contrapuntal traditions that are primarily European
and non-Afrocentric (though of course the lines are blurred) in
origin. To do otherwise strikes me as dishonest. I'm not
interested in becoming the Vanilla Ice (rather than the
3rd Bass) of swing.
 
But back to _The Real Book_:
 
Interestingly, I don't recall the level of error found by Mr. Morse.
Pieces by Towner, Methaney, Steve Swallow (and so on) were often
transcribed by the composers themselves. But perhaps many of the
mistakes of which he speaks had been ironed out by the early eighties,
when I came in contact with the book. I never bought it, though,
because I was preoccupied with studies at New England C to think
about BSM.
 
Incidentally: Anyone who's read my interview in the cyberpunk
issue of Keyboard (May '89) will probably deduce that--merely
in terms of knowledge and experience--I'm not a "neophyte."
Still, the use of such labels is yet another aspect of the
academicized jazz community that disturbs me. I rather
enjoy the presence of neophytes in any artistic community.
For me, the problem is not the neophyte. It is the instant
expert.
 
In the words of Montaigne, "What do I know?"
 
------------------------
 
I've typed and deleted this question a few times in my last five
posts, but now I think it's time to leave it stet.: Is all this
music-specific talk germaine to the Poetics discussion group?
I worry about dragging other poets off-topic. I'd feel better
about this if we could bring our ideas on music notation back
to the topic of *poetic* notation.
 
But I do find it helpful to interpret poetry as written music
and instrumental music in prosodic terms. Here is another paradox:
Although it is useful to frame studies of the arts in interdisciplinary
contexts, the benefits of such studies can prove idiomatic to either art.

The reply is incredible if I read it correctly. Social Text would allow a
sopomoric article that might be a parody to be printed because it was
written by a scientist. We have a new brand of essentialism here.
Meanwhile the journal is compromised doubly, not only by the article, but
by the dissembling reply by Ross.

David Baratier,
On the face of it, your quote from previous post seems a fairly straight-
forward replay of Jakobson-type Russian formalist lit crit.  I fail
to see the motive for your spleen.  Was the theory claiming to be new-fangled?
Did Blake or some other poet put a patent on metrical effects & how to
read them?  Sounds like Finch et al. are simply emphasizing an awareness
of what metrical rhythms might be doing (as opposed, maybe sometimes,
to the "rhythm" of rhetorical effects).  Of course poets who try to
take this turf from the critics are in danger of quick petrification
and de-humidification.  That's why we have critics. - Henry Gould

Dear Dave,
 
Is it the word 'saussure' to which you object? The other part of the quote
looks pretty intelligent from here, unless of course you don't think poems
set up separate structures, or you don't think meaning operates in
differences. Mainly it's monotony I object to, as opposed to repetition,
which is the basis of music, no? Monotony then would mean repetition
without surprise.
 
Come to Teachers College tomorrow morning for a poetry reading and computer
writing demonstration by 6th graders from the Ralph Bunche School. The
reading is at 10 a.m. at Room 157 in Thorndike Hall, 525 W 120th St, New
York.
 
Btw, Rob, is it the Foucaldian paraphrase that turns you off? Wasn't
Foucault paraphrasing Nietzsche's first 'untimely meditation'? To ask along
with Rod Smith, doesn't Chris remind you of Nietzsche, but with more
energy? Energy kicks.

There's a long op-ed piece in today's NY Times defending Social Text(by Stanley
Fish). Seems to me both sides are talking past each other to side issues;
what the imbroglio reveals are unarticulated philosophical assumptions
on both sides.  Ross et al. claim that "of course there's a real world
out there but it's all relative to social constructions of its meaning";
Sokal et al. claim that "the real world reflects a truth that we must
constantly adjust our lenses to grasp".  That's the nub of the difference,
and it gets to the deep issues that Peirce explores in his lifelong
contrasting of realism (or ideal-realism) and nominalism.  He would
I believe come down on the side of Sokal; truth is not relative to
our names for it (nominalism) - our naming is relative to the truth,
and requires empirical testing (realism).  This is an utter
simplification (Hank's demonio reductium!!) but it's the core issue.
All the biz about Sokal or Ross's good faith or credentials are
the side issues.  It's a real dispute about the limits of both
science and its sociology. - Henry Gould

Can we be filled on where Ross's reply appears? Has it been, or will it
be, published somewhere? Or was it meant to be distributed electronically?
 
And did anyone note with interest (as did I) Ross's statement that SOCIAL
TEXT is an "unrefereed" journal?? I realize it may not have a formal
referee process, and that most of its contributions are solicited -- but
this claim has never, so far as I know, appeared inside the journal
itself, let alone near its prominently-featured list of the prominent
members of its "Editorial Collective"?? I wonder how many persons have
sent contributions to ST believing otherwise? What exactly does ST do
with unsoliicted manuscripts, in that case? I'm baffled.
 
Although I'm ambivalent about Stanley Fish, there's a provocative reply
to all of this by him on the OpEd page of today's NY Times.
 
Which does not mention what for me is the oddest irony: the fact that
Sokol's prank is described in the NY Times headline breaking the story
as a "deconstruction" of cultural studies -- thus for the first time
using the term to mean perhaps the exact opposite of Derrida's uses of
it...

 Say, what was the position of Dr Johnson or Piranesi

like alan, i have doubts about ross's caricature of the editorial decision
at _social text_ to accept sokol's piece... i think mebbe ross oughtta just
cop to it, and admit that sokol's prank got past the editorial board...
like david, i find it somewhat disturbing too that ross should now publicly
make the claim for "unrefereed" status, and i'm not a big stanley fish fan,
either---at least, not of late (though i'm gonna try to find that op-ed
piece)... and like henry, i feel that both sides are in fact talking past
the other...
 
nevertheless, i find mself on the ross side of things in terms of
challenging sokol's "leftist" motives, and in terms of what sort of work i
find valuable, even as, again, i do think that sokol managed to put one
over on _social text_, all naysaying to the contrary...
 
the society for literature and science (sls), of which i've been a member
for some eight years, has in the past couple of years addressed (in its
annual conference, and its general discussion) the more conservative
attacks on cultural studies work (in fact there is a somewhat dormant
e-list, litsci-l (now out of ucla), of which i was once listowner, which
one would think would be noisy as hell in light of these recent events)...
i for one have found certain claims coming out of cultural studies,
relative to science in general, problematic... b/c i don't believe that all
empirical inquiry, for example, is intrinsically "positivistic"... and yet
i do believe, with ross, that the sites are contested, as well they should
be, that they should in fact be even more contested... that is, to put
ross's way of putting it in the affirmative, non-experts *should* have
something to say about scientific methodology and epistemology---provided,
that is, they go about their own business as expert-ly as possible... i
mean, i'm not wedded to the idea that a cultural studies type interrogating
a scientific-technological reality becomes, in such methodological terms, a
non-expert... but i'll let the latter terminological slippage slide for the
moment...
 
b/c for me the real matter of the moment here has to do with david's
question about whether ross's reply was meant for electronic
distribution... why is it that this controversy, at least as it's coming
down the pike, is taking place over there, in print?... at least among the
contenders, i mean---ross, fish, sokol, etc?... why the hell don't we have
an electronic forum where sokol, ross, fish and anybody else who's
interested can converge to chew over these... discrepancies?... litsci-l
could be used for same, for example... or even this forum, poetics, which
to its credit is motivated enough to introduce and discuss this issue
almost out-of-context (---thanx steve!)... but i mean, why aren't alla
these well-known folks busy discussing and dialoguing online?---or if they
are (my apologies), where is this happening?...
 
it seems to me that venues like the ny times are not open to everyone
(anymore than are the pages of _social text_) and that in the interest of
things democratic it would help immensely if such conversations weren't
restricted to print, which seems to me to act as a silent mechanism for
silencing those w/o name-status from actively contributing, hence for
constructing a certain sort of "public" space... and i regard this not as a
consequence of conspiracies, but of institutional orthodoxies... which is
to say that, though too many folks still don't have access to emedia, there
are many more who *can* voice their opines in these spaces than are likely
to see their names in the ny times... and i mean, like, the folks who're
doing all the talking surely have email accounts...
 
a lot of the hogwash that's likely to emerge from this controversy could
probably be addressed and dispensed with in just a few email exchanges...
which, of course, is hardly to argue for progress, but which is to make a
claim for process, due and otherwise...

Despite Rob Hardin's reading of what I wrote (taking note of the state of
things is not the same as approving of them), I'm very much in favor of
people performing poetry by others.
 
It is usually extremely interesting to hear a piece of music performed by
the composer (whether you're talking about Stravinsky conducting his own
works, or Pauline Oliveros performing hers), but radically different
performances by other performers can illuminate musical works in a way that
has rarely been considered in the world of literature (cf John Coltrane's
many versions of My Favorite Things, Glenn Gould's Mozart sonatas, etc.).
 
In literature, the author's own version is often taken as the ONLY way to
sound a work out loud.  Texts aren't usually treated as scores for
performance by others, or they are treated more strictly than is often the
case with musical scores.  As long as this is true, any kind of tradition
of performative interpretation will be rare in poetry.
 
If authors wish to give up their authority (as unacknowledged, & often
unacknowledgeable, authors of traditional works in oral cultures have at
least in a de facto way), then maybe there can be a kind of poetry fake
book, in the sense of a way to get a quick overview of how to perform a
work that you literally may never have known of before.
 
Until the cultural context of literature changes that radically, I think we
can only be concerned about which books are not fake poetry books.
 
Which I think we'd all agree is a very different issue, though I doubt we'd
all agree on which books were which.
 
 
Oh, and as an aside to Chris Stroffolino -  I only chose the O'Hara poem
because when I turned to look at the bookshelf next to me the first thing I
saw was the MOMA memorial book of the same title with various artists
illuminating various O'Hara poems.
 
I wasn't thinking (& am not now) in terms of Harold Bloom or any use of the
term interpretation in the sense of criticism, but rather (as described by
several folks in the context of the fake book thread) performance as
interpretation.  As perhaps a lounge poet (sic) might say "here's one of my
own personal favorites, I hope it's one of yours: my interpretation of
"Maximus to Himself." Is the band ready? Ah, one, ah two, one two three
four. I've had to learn ... "

Gee, I really liked Andrew Ross's account of the editorial
decision. It sounded completely plausible to me. Maybe that's
because my own editing experiences have to do with music
publications, and in those settings things are constantly being
published because of something about the identity of the
author. "Yes it's not very good, but it's interesting that a
*composer* is trying to write about it" or "that this
particular composer said that" etc. The statement that they
finally printed it because they thought it was interesting
documentation of a scientist trying to think through some
theoretical things sounds like unvarnished truth to me.
 
If they say they are "unrefereed" doesn't that just mean the
editorial collective makes all the decisions without turning to
other readers for evaulations? Why the fuss?

What a coincidence!  I read Sokal's article in _Lingua Franca_ just last
night, while eating a burrito in one of San Francisco's many

I read Joe's reply and agree with much of it. I've also been writing a
bit about this on the Derrida list and just want to say, briefly, what I
said there - that I don't believe cultural studies/decon folks know very
much about science, and I understand why scientists (including a number
I've known) get angry at them. If you haven't studied mathematica, and,
say a course on fundamental particle physics, including the mathematics,
experimental apparati and methodologies, all you're doing is attempting
to colonize a field you know nothing about, period. In any other cultural
area this would be called imperialism, particularly as we look more and
more towards 'native' voices for ethnography. But science seems a free-
for-all, as if there is a totality called "science" embracing everything
from particle physics to geology, geography, etc. Not only is this in-
correct, but it's also highly prejudicial.
 
Too many cultural theorists are too busy theorizing to actually sit down
and, say, take that course, or work through the books themselves.

I, too, would be interested to know where Ross' reply was printed. I
understand that he will publish a reply to Sokal in the next issue of
_Lingua Franca_.
 
As for the account of how ST  decided to publish the article: yes,
perhaps, as somebody suggested, "unrefereed" just means the editorial
collective decided. I still find that disturbing in the case of an issue
on science if there are no scientists on the editorial board (I'm not sure
whether they are). If one publishes an article from a field that one
doesn't have expertise in, I do think there is an obligation to run it by
somebody from the field to see if it makes sense in its own discipline.
Fish's op-ed piece misses the mark in this respect, I believe: sure, trust
is part of the scholarly/scientific enterprise, but so is fact-checking
and editing.
 
I also found Ross' patronizing attitude toward scientists very disturbing.
So he accepts a piece that he himself thinks is inferior because those
poor physicists don't know how to do better and should be encouraged in
their modest efforts to understand literary and cultural theory? I can't
help but find that attitude condescending.

In-Reply-To:  <960521155615_306350275@emout19.mail.aol.com>
 
My 50p on the fake science issue:
 
If Fish's description in today's NYT of what science studies people, a.k.a.
sociologists of science, do is accurate, than Sokal got it wrong,
perceived a threat to science where there was none, and created a
damaging controversy that will only give the "wrong people" ammunition.
 
But in defense, not of Sokal's actions but of his reactions to the books he
read: it's easy to imagine Sokal reading some badly-written or
poorly-thought-out science studies pieces, and coming to the false
conclusion that science studies people thought phlogiston was just as
real as oxygen.  And it would be bad for (e.g.) the global climate if
everyone started to believe in phlogiston.  Again, if Fish is right,
science studies can't possibly pose such a risk; but Sokal probably
hadn't been reading Fish.
 
To generalize:
        The badly-written pieces in any subfield, especially a subfield
that challenges the basic assumptions of the wider culture, do serious
damage to that field's attempt to get itself taken seriously outside the
subdisciplines in which it's already established.  Bad American
deconstructionists encouraged people to laugh, unfairly, at something called
"deconstruction," and every dull or badly-informed piece of academic
writing about popular culture encourages people who don't "do" contemporary
popular culture to believe that it's not worth studying, or even to feel
threatened by the "growing" study of it.  Careful editing is always a
good; in a controversial subfield it ought to be a tactical necessity.
 
An example in a quite
different subfield (and one that's unlikely to offend anyone reading this
list) is Reynolds and Press' _The Sex Revolts_, a poorly-written, sloppy
book applying queer theory to underground rock, and one that's probably
done some damage to whatever receptive audience there might have been for
a good one down the road.
 
Re Andrew Ross' defense: it makes sense to me that _Social Text_
 would want to publish in an issue devoted to Science Wars the
"take" on these issues of somebody trained in physics, especially if they
didn't have any other essays reflecting a physics background, and if Sokal
essay was more interesting than whatever else _Social Text_
happened to have in the "science" file of their bottom drawer.
 
What struck me as slightly wacky in Ross' piece  was the hint of an assumption
that the cultural authority of scientists, because it had often been used to
promote sexism and other bad things, therefore _ought_ to be undermined.
It's easy to imagine practicing scientists-- especially in some fields
with immediate political implications, say climatology-- considering it a
matter of some moral urgency that their profession GAIN cultural authority.
If Miami's going to be underwater unless we listen more to climatologists
(and I'm not saying it is) then climatologists have a good and ethical
reason to want to protect certain aspects of their privileged positions.
 
 
Finally:
 
Those who, like me, don't know much about science studies but find it
interesting anywaymight want to look at last week's (not this week's)
TLS, which had a full-page review of a science studies book out of
Edinburgh. There's some blather about the information age in the front,
but you can ignore it.

1. Two persons have now suggested that "unrefereed" means "without external
reviewers." They may very well be right; I've never heard the term
"unrefereed" before. What I've heard is the term "refereed," as in "you
should fill your cv with publications of essays in refereed journals."
"Refereed" in this case meaning "peer reviewed." Implying that
"unrefereed" means "not peer reviewed." In any meaningful sense of the
term "refereed," review of unsolicited manuscripts by ST's Editorial
Collective would seem to qualify as "refereed."
 
I don't know why I should care so much about this, except that I guess
that Ross's use of the "u" term struck me as a kind of after-the-fact
denial of responsibility. It sounds like he's saying that ST isn't a
standard academic journal -- which I very much hope it is, for it until
now has done little to explain how it differs from one.
 
2. The science question, I just can't go on about this, but I disagree
witha  great deal of what's been said. Science is *always* a cultural
practice, always embedded, standards of objectivity themselves embedded.
Ross and Fish give up too much ground in their defense. The crucial place
to read about this is less sociology of science, in my opinion, and more
feminist critiques of science. The notion that culturla theorists don't
"know science" is itself deeply problematic: what is "science"? What is
it that an astronomer knows about science that is shared with a molecular
biologist? One thesis of cultural theory re: science, as I've said,
considers it as cultural practice, integrated into every aspect of our
culture (he says, typing on his computer): what puts a "scientist" into a
privileged position regarding cultural practices and their theoritization
and keeps a cultural theorist away from said privilege? It would be one
thing if Ross was trying to tell somebody how to extract DNA from human
tissue; but to suggest that the biologist is in a beetter position to
"theorize" that pracitce begs the question.
 
Furthermore, practicing scientists themselves differ just as much as
non-scientists in their views -- consider, for example, S.J. Gould, E. F.
Keller, & R. Lewontin, all of whom are or were hard-core scientists, all
of whom (Keller & Lewontin more than Gould) accept the "cultural
practice" view of science.
 
And experience (and th pages of Scientific American) show that a lot of
philosopphers are really bad theorists, thinkers, writesr, about much but
their own specific efforts or experiments.
 
3. The relation of all this to poetics is...

They both know what it's like to 'do' science - to have to test one's
hypotheses against observation. This is something that cultural theorists (and
other theorists, eg theoretical physicists) do not have to do. Being a
practising scientist is a quick way to lose the illusion that science is about
discovering universal truths - it is about formulating useful, falsifiable
hypotheses that are tentatively accepted until something better comes along.
 
They should also both know some physics - new theories of electromagnetism,
for example, would affect both spectroscopy and the formation of protein
molecules. This is where science gains usefulness over pure empiricism - all
its fields are connected, and developments in one area may produce new ideas in
another discipline. Reductionism may have a bad name in some circles, but it's
an extremely useful tool.
 
It's sad to see so much anti-science feeling still among people in the arts and
humanities. I'd hoped that Snow's 'two cultures' had gone further towards
talking to one another. Part of it, I think, comes from a simplistic view of
'Western Thought', and of science's place within it. It's true that much of
today's research is tied up with military-industrial power structures, and that
some have misused science to promote racism and patriarchy. On the other hand,
many see the mind/body duality as part of western thought, but science, and
philosophes such as Diderot, have done more to undermine this duality than any
amount of deconstruction.
 
Perhaps it's a question of territory, and the tendency to see everything in
terms of one's discipline. A cultural theorist tends to see everything in terms
of culture, in the same way that a physicist might reduce everything to
physics, or an economist reduce everything to money. I'd like to think that
writing poetry is a useful way to understand what our senses tell us, and so is
science.

I'm enjoying this thread.  I remember that as an undergraduate, I found
myself writing more/being more "creative" when I was taking what are thought
of as "left brain" courses:  Intro to Logic, Astonomy, Biology, Technical
writing, etc.  I never exactly tried to express why that was, except that I
found the *ways* of thinking and perceiving through a different "discipline"
stimulating -- the new  vocabulary, a new system of thinking, a whole new set
of metaphor and description.
 
I married a soil scientist who also happens to write pretty decent poems.  We
had many discussions about how the scientific method is indeed creative, and
how frustrating he found the bias in liberal arts against science.   Of
course, the complementary bias in the sciences exists as well, which he found
much more frustrating.
 
Just my $.02.  Thanks Tom.

Subject:      Will Alexander's work
 
 about Will Alexander's work--
 
 
 Ron,
 
 Eric Dolphy used to talk about trying to hit three or four notes at the
 same time, & there are other *out* musicians who have said
 (theorized & practiced) the same, so I'd begin by connecting it with
 something like that.  Will has an incredible record (LP) collection.
 
 Perpetual fire in language with meaning (everything in there has
 meaning/means something:  I remember Will saying how he got the
 biggest dictionary he could, read it all, spending a lot of time writing
 down every interesting word he found in it -- filling many
 notebooks, which he uses for content) --  he's a self-proclaimed jock & a
 surrealist artist (painter as well as writer):  going at it on all levels --
 sometimes I think of his writing as something like a museum of
 Bosch paintings -- each piece having everything it has in it in it &
 everything else too -- symbolism, meaning, spirit, contraries,
 whatever you see or experience in it.  othertimes it is something else.
 surrealism with meaning??  i don't know about that, but the
 combination of books he celebrates as sensual in "The Myrmidons of
 Oblivion" are by Cesaire, Turgenyev, and Rene Leys, if that says
 anything.  Anyway It seems as though all the various things in the
 _in this_ places are there in Asia, so dark and psychedelic.
 
 "logorheaic excess (a pleonast's plenitude)..." is one thing, & one way
 to read it.  It could also be something like someone who's totally
 smashed on language & the oppression of people, especially non-
 white cultures, for a few centuries. Will's work seems like all those
 things (a wild and relentless unpublicized history). Of course this
 would be shot down in a workshop! How many students (or teachers)
 want to (have the time to?) to deal with a poem such as Asia.  The
 "voices" in the poem are the spirits of murdered Tibetan monks who
 have come back to perform "astral warfare" on the Chinese.  It's
 much more gruesome than "Helter Skelter", & a challenging read.
 The "we" is artifice, for sure, but I'm willing to allow Will to imagine
 the voices of slaughtered monks (who probably didn't think the
 marxists were scaly, but who knows what they were thinking as
 they were feeling the bullets approaching their skin?)   Also, "here
 was Marx, here was the state" to me implies that the two are
 seperate, not together, in the "voices" mind, for what it's worth
 
 The footnote on page twelve is refering to a quote from one of the
 books Will makes multiple references in the poem, listed on p. 138.
 the quotes in the poem & notes are from these books, not an earlier
 draft of the poem.

Like Ursula Heise, I find Andrew Ross's condescending tone to scientists
extremely irritating.  As someone married to a scientist (an M.D.) who
writes countless articles, I think it should make clear that the purpose
of, say, articles in CIRCULATION is to describe new and better ways of
treating heart disease, in my husband's case of prolonging the lives of
those with congenital heart disease--people who used to die at age 16 or
so and with scientific advances, now live to middle age and beyond.  The
purpose of articles about such disease is to inform other members of the
profession as to specific treatments, advances, problems, etc.  It's not
to be clever or to find essentialist truth, etc etc.
 
So when Stanley Fish says on today's Op Ed page that--gotcha!--because the
poor deluded scientist didn't even realize that the issue was the social
construction of science not scientific truth, he is entirely missing the
point which was that a non-sociologist of science could produce a spoof
which was ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION in what is supposedly a classy journal
which turns down many articles and essays.  On what basis was it
accepted??  All of Ross's excuses and Fish's disclaimers won't convince me
until they manage to get an article into CIRCULATION or any comparable
journal.
 
The real issue here is :  what is the purpose of professional publication?
Is it to chat with other like minded humanists about what we think science
is?  Or is to advance knowledge in some way?
 
No wonder the public thinks we're a bunch of decadent creeps!

I had the same feeling. Mathematics, in particular, I found a highly creative
activity, requiring intuitive leaps as well as rigorous logic. Some of group
theory and what mathematicians call 'foundations' (the intersection of logic,
set theory and number theory) is especially beautiful.
 
People often talk about the connections between mathematics & music, but the
only connection that I found useful at the time was in understanding acoustics
and digital sampling. I'll mathematical composition to Xenakis.

Yes, and I was as guilty as any. I've no problems now about being a scientist
who writes poetry, but my scientific background leads me to bristle at some
extremes of post-structuralist theory - for example, the refusal of many
cultural theorists to even _consider_ the possibility of biological influences
upon human behaviour.
 
I've rarely tried to involve science in my poetry, and tend to cringe at most
attempts to write poems about chaos theory. My career in meteorology has
affected my writing - but on the other hand, show me a poet who has never
mentioned rain, wind, sunshine or clouds! I find that, contrary to some claims,
the more I know about a phenomenon such as thunderstorms, the _more_ they fill
me with wonder and awe.
 
On rare occasions I've written from a persona that uses scientific metaphors:
 
 
 
       _The Physicist Drinks to Forget_
 
 
 
        no use in
        crying

        that turns around us

        around me, turns
        me around
 
                        --
 
        what's the use of
        laws, the attractions
        of gravity, electricity?
                   all it takes
        is three bodies (sun,
        earth, that damned cold
        moon)
             and we're lost
 
        and I'm caught
                       lying
        like a star fallen
 
        till the dew
        falls, twinkles

        clear as gin
 
 
 
       _The mathematician defines her space_

        with new axioms, construct
        a metric, a way to measure
        space, the distances
        between us.
 
 
 
It amuses me now to recall how many of my colleagues really talked like this,
using mathematical jargon to describe their personal lives.
 
There's been some transfer the other way too. Some aspects of theory, in
particular hypertext theory, have informed my current work: writing/designing
computer-aided learning packages for meteorologists. I've gone away from the
standard heirarchical presentation of knowledge (headings, subheadings, sub-
subheadings &c) in favour of a dense web of hyperlinked nodes. This, I think,
is much closer to the way that the atmosphere actually works.
 
 
        Cheers &c,
 
        Tom Beard.

Fake books, fake science...it's all intriguing.
 
But I was especially amused at the raised eyebrows over the idea of
Social Text (a mag which I've always presumed to imply the term social
as in "social mixer" or, better, "social climber"), that form of
postmodernism that knows how to dress, should be "unrefereed."
 
So I thought I would throw my perception that the "referee" process is
one of the great hoaxes of academic life. It generally neuters the
journal that uses it (why there has never been a really good college
literary magazine) and, in critical areas, often tends to permit a lot
of ax grinding go on behind the curtains. I've seen good articles
rejected because a referee did not want X or Y (including some Xs and
Ys on this list) to make a credible argument from an established
position that might later compromise his or her forthcoming article(s),
or to pay off a grudge on some tenure or step increase decision.
 
It's no accident that all of the decent magazines over the past 80
years have been the work of single, strong-willed individuals, even
ones with whom one might not agree. Editorial committees by their
nature seek compromise -- at the Socialist Review, where we had two
collectives (one of which, in Boston, tended to "referee" articles and
one of which, in the Bay Area, did not), we lost several great articles
because they were simply too provocative -- including a great Samuel R.
Delaney response to Donna Harraway that is still unpublished. That we
managed to print "Manifesto for Cyborgs" (by an editorial majority of
5-4 in which the deciding vote declared that SR ought to publish
"anything I can't understand") or Avital Ronell's manifesto for nuclear
criticism always amazed me. Leslie Scalapino's response to my own intro
to a collection of poetry (which gave rise to the much fuller dialog
that later appeared in Poetics Journal) certainly could not make it
through the process -- I was the lone vote in favor of publishing it.
 
So let me add one additional category to this discourse:
refereeing = fake editing

Subject:      Re: fake science
 
Hope you'll all forgive me for harping on my hobbyhorse again, but I'm
reading Peirce (that shd be clear by now) & can't get over how relevant
it is to the Sokal flap.  He sets up a philosophical position that not
only grounds the realist/nominalist distinction (as I related to the
dispute in earlier post) - he also debunks the arrogance of science
(in scientism & positivism) which dominated the "philosophy of science"
at the end of the 19th century.  He was able to do this because he
was one of those rare birds, a real philosopher coming out of a background
in experimental science.  His explorations in logic led to an architecture
of meaning which describes nature's operations as "like a language";
which suggests a cosmic sentience or universal Mind not on theological
claims (transcendentalism) but on observation of the workings of logic
itself - a creative tripartite structure in which the "chance" subject
is linked to a general "predicate" which has meaning in the context
of the whole as "coming from the future" (a consensus of truth).
 
Wish I could be more precise - I know how foggy this all sounds - but
what I'm driving at is that Peirce revaluates some of these
issues - the social construction of science, the relation of reality
to our descriptions of it, and the relations between creative thinking
in general both to chance and what can be termed "the true".  And he does this
in ways that can't be pigeon-holed as conservative, idealistic, positivistic,
etc.  He took care not to be pigeonholed by those who claimed him
as their guide - Wm James & the pragmatists.  It almost goes without
saying that he was ostracized, attacked & ignored by the academic
establishment of the time & died in poverty.  There is the possibility
of a philosophy of science which recognizes the "fallibilism" (Peirce's
term) of socially and politically-textured knowledge without
falling into either camp of "nominalist" relativism or its obverse
twin, positivist empiricism.  - Henry Gould

I second the motion. The erasure of personality has been one of the
ungreatest inventions of our time.  Have had this same perception about
committee (job) interviews, by the way (of less direct interest to this
list).  Have always felt I could hire more effectively with the benefit of
clear, direct thinking on the part of one individual, rather than trying not
to offend or threaten certain components of the sprawling decisionmaking
vehicle..
 
Committees and referee groups are inherently intuition bashers when it comes
to decisionmaking of this sort.  Groups are better for idea development and
other things.

I think Ron's account in fact highlights my own unease with Ross's claim.
SOCIAL TEXT's editorial process makes it not very different from most
other journals. Ross strikes me as dissembling when he uses the term
"unrefereed" to imply that ST is somehow less at fault for what happened.
The truth is that he and the Editorial Collective screwed up big time --
screwed up in a way that reflects badly on a cause that I for one think
is important -- and Ross should have apologized for it. By throwing all
the blame (instead of the, say, 50% he deserves) on Sokol, Ross makes
himself and the "cause" look even worse.
 
Did I mention that the rest of the essays in the "Science Wars" issue in
fact raise all the points we've been discussing here, often with a great
deal of sophistication? Funny how, even in my own mind, the 15 or 16
articles in the issue that aren't by Sokol have just vanished from
discussion.
 
And the truth is? I think Ross et al are too cock-sure to believe they
could be fooled -- and thus were fooled. And surely this does show that
some more caution and care and attention are needed, at least in halls
like those of SOCIAL (-climbing, thanks Ron) TEXT.

Some further thoughts on Ross's apologia for the Social Text fiasco:
 
The crux of what I consider plain bad faith is Ross's sentence, "Sokal's
article would have been considered sophomoric and outdated . . . had it
come from a humanist or social scientist."  But coming from a "scientist"
it was deemed acceptable so that Social Text readers could see how
"scientists" regard things.
 
How essentialist can you get?  The very people who castigate those who say
"Women think X but men think Y," or "Heterosexuals do X but gays do Y" are
now assuming that there's an entity called "scientist" that "represents" a
fixed point of view.  Instead of judging the essay according to its
argument, its originality, its interest, and so on, the editorical
"collective" (read, board) thought they'd publish the article so
that their readers might be exposed to that specimen known as scientist.
It's a pretty frightening mode of thought...
 
Secondly, as to refereed journals.  If indeed it is true that all ST
essays are commissioned, what sort of "social text" is this?  Where is the
openness to other points of view?  For whom is the journal produced?  The
silly designation "editorial collective" can't mask the authoritarianism
and, yes, political correctness involved in such hokey operations.

     The word "Saussure" instigated the note. While I no longer have the

     substitution and that I was focused on why "metrical meaning" was such
     an "obvious reference to Saussure" as compared to Blake,
     Wollstencraft, Pope, and anon previous practitioners. It wasn't the

Subject:      fake science...
 
i'm really enjoying this thread... again, i wanna reiterate that, as i see
it, ross shoulda simply admitted that he and the rest of his editorial
board were bamboozled by sokol... i like to attribute good intention where
i'm able, so i prefer to read ross's lapse---his convoluted justification
(this my opine even after reading marjorie's, david's and ron's glosses on
"unreferreed" etc.)---as owing to ross's commitment to cultural studies-ish
agenda...
 
at the same time (as a former practicing engineer, just to authorize my own
experience a tad), i feel the need to aver that there is damned good work
being done from a cultural studies angle that addresses scientific and
technological practice (both contemporary as well as historically
remote)... sure, there are debates over same (witness, for example, helen
longino's response to donna haraway's notion of "core narratives" from
within a phil. of sci. perspective)... and, with alan and tom and ursula k.
and ___, i share the view, which again has been debated for years now
within sls, that the cultural/literary side of things should know its
science ... much as i expect scientists to know their cultural studies...
 
but this again is where the problem lies:  science as an arbiter of truth
has a much more programmatic influence in our society (not to mention
funding) than the humanities... this may not be what scientists or
engineers intend (and for the moment, again, i'll refrain from
distinguishing between scientists on the one hand and technological
professionals on the other)... but it's painfully evident on my tech.
campus who gets to say what, and how, and how much government
monies---taxpayer dollars---support this power differential... which
suggests that there are some institutional realities that need to be
understood aright if one is to go about understanding how science and
technology operate in practice...
 
it's not that american culture, for example, is 'un' or 'non-literary' as a
direct result of scientific hegemony, or that scientists are operating,
say, in a literary void, are  uninfluenced by aesthetics etc... what's at
stake here are the various ways that our institutions act to discourage
scientific practitioners, as well as much of the public, from understanding
just how intimately science and technology are bound up with social and
cultural developments... and perhaps there would be some benefit to
understanding, as well, the degree to which the humanities (broadly
speaking) has often resisted the legislated primacy of more functional
(even vocational) studies by sticking its collective heads in the sand...
 
so those who choose to explore the interconnections among (?) these domains
are bound to find themselves in mixed company, so to speak... it's fraught
terrain, punctuated by territorial struggles and anxieties... and practical
jokes (like sokol's) aside, there's a certain need, as i see it, to try to
speak in ways that promote dialogue, not division...

Just to clarify, the reference to Saussure was in regards to Annie Finch's
basic structuralist thesis in _The Ghost of Meter_. It wasn't a
"substitution", it was an attempt to indicate her debt to a line of
thought that originates in Saussure's structuralist linguistics,
especially her notion that metrical meaning arises (again, in some
cases) out of differences within a structure, rather than as an
identity of some particular rhythm and some particular transcendent meaning.

Steven,
I'm sure there's somebody better qualified on this list, but I'll
do what I can re: Peirce & "nominalism/realism".  Peirce went deeper
into the study of logic & came up with more new insights on it
than anyone in his time.  He had a huge ambition to build an
"architectonic" philosophy on the level of Aristotle or Kant.
His studies in logic led him to the disputes of high scholasticism
over the status of "universals".  Are "universals" (general
concepts, like "humanity") real - do they have a real existence
beyond our verbal conceptualizations?  Or is the universe made
up of pure particularities?  Realists claimed that our general
concepts corresponded to some real general order to reality
outside the mind; nominalists called general concepts artificial
"names" by which we order reality.  These debates were taken
to depths of great subtlety and nuance; as one commentator on
Peirce put it, Duns Scotus (realist) and Occam (nominalist)
were divided by the width of a hair.
    Peirce felt these issues pervaded world-views into our own
time; as I tried to summarize in earlier post, to a nominalist
truth is relative to human language about it; to a realist our
language is relative to the truth and must always be adjusted
by experiment & experience.  Peirces own "pragmaticist" way
began as kind of a middle road between the two: his scientific
training gave him a deep respect for "brute fact" and chance
which counterbalanced any truth-claims that weren't backed up
both by the logic of experiment and by human consensus; while
his belief in a reality which corresponded to our abstract
conceptions kept him out of both the British empiricist stream
of skepticism (Hume et al.) and the scientific positivism
which took its place.  One of the fascinating things about
Peirce is this combination of scientific humility & discipline
with philosophical originality: his pragmatic-ideal-realism
grew more subtle as he explored the logic of nature as a
semiotic system.  His final formulations of a definition of
"truth" are careful in the extreme & map out the distinctions
of which the debates about the social constructions (or
constrictions) of knowledge, the limits of science, and the
limits of Mind and causation are all taken into account.
Peirce was recognized as a prescient thinker who foresaw
developments in quantum theory & relativity; some commentators
have noted close affinities between his work & that of
physicist David Bohm 100 yrs later.  In Peirce, the
postmodern "social embeddedness" of science is further
de-centered by an extremely stringent conception of what
real knowledge consists of : it is predicated on meanings
("thirdness") operating on present understanding FROM THE
FUTURE.   There was no question for him, however, of which
side he lands on in the realist/nominalist debate : the order
(which includes chaos) of which we are a part exists outside
of our present formulations of its meaning.  For someone
who believed in real general truths, pragmaticism was a
way of escaping the pitfalls of both an unscientific idealism
(Emerson) and a pseudo-scientific positivism.  And it was
all built on what he perceived as the creative logic of
hypothesis.
 
The best intro to his bizarre career is by Joseph Brent -
"Charles Sanders Peirce: a life" (Indiana UP, 1993)
- Henry Gould
 
p.s. someone was talking on this thread about scientists-as-poets:
Brent mentions that Peirce revered Poe; he discovers a lot of
affinities between Peirce himself and Baudelaire, of all people.

FYI -- for those who were inquiring about the death of Michael Taylor --
According to an article in yesterday's _LA Times_, both police and
Taylor's friends believe that the people who killed Taylor were
attempting to steal an expensive piece of radio equipment he had acquired
while preparing to start up a microbroadcasting station.  Police suspect
there may have been more people involved in the murder than the three
suspects who have been arrested.

FYI2 -- same _LA Times_ finally ran an article on the death, in Japan, of
Johnny "Guitar" Watson -- took 'em long enough -- maybe they were shamed
into by the obit. in New York -- Watson was a central figure in LA music
for decades.  In contrast, the same paper had a next day article on the
death of an actor from the cast of _General Hospital_ --

Subject:      summa more peirce
 
One more blip on why I think Sokal et al & Ross talking past each other
& why philosopher on level of Bohm or Peirce is useful.  Philosophy
began with poetry & became a way of talking about cosmos in _everyday
terms_ - common knowledge.  This is important to remember.  Science
falls prey to positivism: i.e., "we don't need philosophy - we've got
power".  Leads to science jargon & techno-elite.  If people think
Social Text is jargon, try reading any advanced math book.  If Sokal
bases his judgement on the experimental method alone, he is certainly
open to the postmodern critique & rightly so.  Yet, on the other hand,
I can hear Peirce looking at the whole gamut of postmodernism, post-
structuralism, etc. etc. and saying: these are the nominalists of our
day.  To them, since the real is purely relative, a blank, we will
"theorize" to our heart's content, without the messy trouble of
evidence, proofs, logic, argument, etc... we'll go on sophistry alone.
Note that this strain loves to wrap itself in the mantle of "poetry" -
and with friends like this the scar's the delimit.
 
What's missing here is a philosophy which can make sense of knowing
and un-knowing, conscious & unconscious, slips and trips, mine &
Thou(ght). Poets make nature second nature. - Henry Gould

This is a product endorsement.  The Mac Low, Duncan and Waldrop books are

Well, i dint *think* i was, but now that you mention it i've been getting
more and more fascinated by how much of what we want to call "thinking"
(w/ rationalist connotations) is actually unconscious (and this sort of
loosely ties in to Henry's latest stuff on Peirce, or at least one small
bit of it).  So who knows--maybe i somehow *meant* to fake it all along?
And, of course, i can't leave this question without the obligatory nod
toward our medium here, and how it blurs both author-ization and
intentionality.  One tries, sort of, to construct stable entities out of
all these floating names and addresses (the personalized "sig" as an
attempt to stabilize the flux, carve out a little real estate w/ your
name out front?), but it's so hard to remember "who" said what...

deportation and certain execution in Turkey as a result of his effective
human rights advocacy and his radical use of electronic media.
 
burn administrators and other IWW internet workers are extremely concerned
about this situation, but our ability to formulate a response strategy is

  PRESS RELEASE #8
 
  APRIL 16, 1996 - FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
     TURKISH GOVERNMENT CONVINCES U.S. TO ARREST KURDISH ACTIVIST IN D.C.
 
 
 
   In a bold move, trying to discredit the peaceful efforts of the
   American Kurdish Information Network (AKIN), the government of Turkey
   persuaded the U.S. State Department to seek the arrest of Kani Xulam,
   that group's respected spokesman in Washington, D.C.
 
   Xulam has been advising members of Congress and the Administration of
   the atrocities perpetrated by Turkish armed forces in their
   destruction ofover 3,000 Kurdish villages, the murder of tens of
   thousands of civilians, and the forced relocation of millions. Turkey
   relies on U.S. military aidto enforce its denial of fundamental human
   rights to some 20 million Kurds.
 
   Xulam comes from Turkish occupied Kurdistan, where he - as all other
   Kurds - was forbidden to use his native Kurdish language. Now, on the
   pretext of "passport fraud", the State Department initiated legal
   proceedings which resulted in Xulam's arrest last week and his
   appearance on Monday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.
 
   In an affidavit to the court, the State Department claimed that it had
   been informed by the government of Turkey that Xulam "may be a member"
   of a terrorist organization. Based on that allegation by a foreign
   power that seeks to silence Xulam, the federal magistrate detained
   him. Apparently, the government is afraid Xulam may flee the country
   and they want him held so that he can be deported.
 
   Some twenty local human rights activists appeared to speak for Xulam's
   character and long time commitment to seek peaceful solutions to the
   present conflict between the Turkish armed forces and the Kurdish
   people. Among them were Kathryn Cameron Porter, President of Human
   Rights Alliance and wife of Rep. John Porter (R, IL.), Maryam Elahi of
   Amnesty International, and Sister Patricia Krommer of the Human Rights
   Foundation.
 
   Although the AKIN offices in Washington, D.C. were searched and its
   papers rummaged, it is still operating and will continue to campaign
   for the rights of Kurds everywhere.
 
   Ralph D. Fertig, Secretary of the Board of Directors of AKIN and a
   former federal administrative judge for the E.E.O.C. in Los Angeles,
   commented: "It is clear that these proceedings against Xulam are
   testimony to his effectiveness in alerting American public officials
   to the use of U.S. tax dollars to support and equip the Turkish
   government in its violation of basic human rights of the Kurds. Xulam
   is a dedicated pacifist, and his efforts have been used in the best
   American tradition of peacefully petitioning the U.S. government.
   Neither he nor his cause shall be silenced."
 
   Respectfully,J. Azboy
   Director

You've got me pretty damn interested in Peirce here.  He's actually someone
i've meant to check out for a long time (in the mental cardfile somewhere
near Muriel Rukeyser's bio of the similarly crucial-but-neglected
physicist Willard Gibbs).  Anyway, there's no question these are still
live issues.  To shift the terms a bit, i sometimes feel *everything* is
about the dialectic of "the ideal" and "concrete."  On the latter side,
here's something from the neuroscientist (and lucid explicator) Francisco
Varela.  He starts off by talking about the old-dominant top-down idealist
approach to knowledge, then goes on to say:
 
There are strong indications that among the loose federation of sciences
dealing with knowledge and cognition--the cognitive sciences--there is a
slowly growing conviction that the picture is upside down, that a radical
paradigmatic or epistemic shift is is rapidly developing.  At the very
center of htis emerging view is the belief that the proper units of
knowledge are primarily *concrete*, embodied, incorporated, lived.  This
unique, concrete knowledge, its historicity and context, is not "noise"
that occludes the brighter pattern to be captured in its true essence,
an abstraction, nor is it a step toward something else: it is how we arrive
and where we stay."
 
And another sample:
 
"There is considerable support for the view that brains are not logical
machines, but highly cooperative, nonhomogeneous and distributed networks.
The entire system resembles a *patchwork* of subnetworks assembled by
a complicated history of tinkering, rather than an optimized system
resulting from some clean unified design."
 
(from "The Reenchantment of the Concrete," in *Zone 6*)

Yes, _Marine Snow_ came out in 1995, from ECW Press, and it's quite
marvelous. ECW, I believe, is trying to gain distribution by SPD, but may
not have such distribution yet. The address of ECW is 2120 Queen Street
East, Toronto, Ontario M4E 1E2, Canada. The price is not printed on the
book, so I can't tell you what it costs, Canadian or American.
 
Chax will be bringing out Karen Mac Cormack's  _The Tongue Moves Talk_ in
the fall of 1996. I'm sure I'll make some kind of announcement on the
Poetics List, although keep in touch, please. We should be moved before that
book comes out, so it's possible I won't have email or Poetics List
connection for a while in late summer/early fall.

Re Karen Mac Cormack: yes, she has published a new book since "Quirks &
Quillets," namely "Marine Snow," from ECW Press (1995). Also not to be
forgotten are the books preceding Q&Q: "Quill Driver" (Nightwood Editions
1989) & "Straw Cupid" (Nightwood 1987). All of it, I think, lovely,
lovely books - she keeps amazing & delighting me. -- Pierre

I agree that anonymous submissions (as in PMLA) are obnoxious but Ron, I
wonder if you really mean what you're saying.  I serve on a lot of
editorial boards and, for instance, on CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE I think the
process is extremely fair.  All "refereed" means is that particular
members of the board are sent an article to evaluate and their reports
then go to the editors in chief.  But I take it that Social Text doesn't
even bother with that-- they just commission articles.  Which means no one
outside the little clique gets in.  Do you really think that's optimal?
 
I think the best and liveliest journals are more open than that.

Just quick to note that I think Andrew Ross is WAY ok. He's the real thing--

I think he has a great deal to say that should be listened to (paricualarly

The Sokal brooha is a media non-issue as most media issues are, the facile
foolishness & complete lack of contextual acumen evinced by the "reporters"
is deeply offensive-- whatever mistakes an academic might make at least most
don't make the mistake of believing the New York Times (only slightly
overstated rhetoric). It's also troubling the degree to which the media
control the terms of conversation even here on our little corner of the

Can someone forward me Ross's response (or the whole of yesterday's
listserv if that's easier)? I want to forward it to Howie Winant,
sociologist at Temple, old *Socialist Review* friend of Ron's.
 
There are, Howie tells me, already jokes circulating around this issue.
I.e.: when the editors realized they'd been had, they opened the twelfth
story window, jumped out, and fell up.
 
The whole issue is fascinating & goes back a long way: Pythagoras,
Lucretius, etc. But more 'recently', Wordsworth in one of the original
avantgarde manifestos, "Preface to the Lyrical Ballads," makes a big deal
about poetry as the more capacious and mobile form for scientific truths.
A grandiose defensive hope that poetry will subsume science.
 
I agree with Marjorie about Ross's condescension & essentializing, which
seems pretty clearly to come from defensiveness. Why not just say, "You
got us?" and go on to the bigger issue, the huge chasms between the spheres
of discourse? If the rhetorical sour notes in Ross's piece are overlooked,
he does say some interesting things that point toward that problem, at
least as I remember the piece. But the sour notes are sour, and the
projection of sophomoric theorizing onto Sokal clearly bounces back onto
*Social Text*: wasn't S's article saying that gravity was a construct?
 
Like I say, if anyone on the list could forward it to me, I'd appreciate it
(perelman@english.upenn.edu)
 
b)
 
And speaking of attempts to unite spheres of discourse: I just got an
advance copy of *The Marginalization of Poetry: Language Writing and
Literary History*; they tell me it will be out in about a week. Cloth or
paper (nice cover). Contains:
 
1) "The Marginalization of Poetry"--(revised) genre-cross-dressing poem
 
2) "Language Writing and Literary History"--group formation;  collaboration;
individual readings
 
3) "Here and Now on Paper: The Avant-Garde Particulars of Robert
Grenier"--*This* 1; I HATE SPEECH; the oxymoron of avantgarde narrative;
*Pieces*/*Sentences*; *Transpiring etc*
 
4) "Parataxis and Narrative: The New Sentence in Theory and Practice"--new
sentence, Jameson's take, narrative issues, collage, Berrigan; Silliman /
Hejinian; new sentence 'novels'
 
5) "Write the Power: Orthography and Community"--Bernstein; genre-wars;
error & textuality; Brathwaite's nation-language
 
6) "Building a More Powerful Vocabulary: Bruce Andrews and the World
(Trade Center)"--Andrews & and the attempt to shatter (literary) capital;
identity poetics; Angelou's "Pulse of Morning"/"Pumice of Morons"
(Coolidge & Fagin's OULIPO parody)
 
7) "This Page is My Page, This Page is Your Page: Gender and
Mapping"--American male-gaze landscape poem, Frost, Stafford, &
derivatives (Sharp-Implement School, in Rae Armantrout's phrase); the
political maps of Ginsberg ("Wichita Vortex Sutra") & Ashbery ("Daffy Duck
in Hollywood"); Watten's *Progress* as anti-map; women's non-nominalist
maps: Dahlen *A Reading*, Susan Howe "Thorow", Armantrout *Necromance*,
Harryman, *In the Mode Of*
 
8) "An Alphabet of Literary History"--signifying poems of & on literary

i'm intrigued about this particular question of refereed vs. unrefereed...
seems to me that, though no review is entirely 'blind,' a publishing
enterprise can effect a significant over-the-transom result if it at least
attempts some anonymity... i mean, i can't see as how partiality is
necessarily wrong, but i also can't see as how impartiality (to whatever
extent this is possible) can't be of some use either... depends on the
editor(s), no?...
 
now as to how one goes about making such matters public, or what it
means---ethically, say---to violate stated editorial policies---well, these
seem to me to be somewhat different, if related, issues...

I have been following this thread with terrific interest.  As a poet and
critic who is currently teaching science writing and has served as the
managing editor for a major scientific journal (the Journal of
Neuroscience), I must agree with Marjorie: There's no substitute for a
good peer referee process.
 
What can the humanities learn from the peer review proces in science?  In
my experience, the following:
 
For almost all scientific journals at least two written peer reviews are
ALWAYS given.  These reviews are generally timely (written within a
month), extensive, and helpful.  The typical form of such reviews is
tripartite:
 
        1) A summary of the submitted piece, showing that the reviewer
        knows what she's talking about;
 
        2) A section of major critiques and suggestions; and
 
        3) A list of minor critiques (reference errors, typos, etc.)
 
In the journal I worked for, readers were also asked to rate work on its
quality and importance.  (These numbered ratings were not given to the
authors).
 
This kind of peer reviewing is quite standard in scientific journals:  if
the review process isn't followed properly, nobody is well served and the
history is lost.
 
My experience with humanities journals is much more mixed.  Some essays
have been very thoroughly reviewed, which I appreciate.  Some reviews have
been cursory at best.  I have had one essay accepted by a "peer-reviewed"
journal over email, with no suggestions for revision at all.  I wrote back
to the editor saying, didn't somebody have some constructive suggestion?
He said no, they just thought it should be published as is.  I would like
to think this reflected the quality of my argument, but I honestly believe
it was more indicative of a shoddy review process.
 
I must also point out that while the best science journals typically tell
authors the disposition of a manuscript WITHIN A MONTH (at J. Neurosci.
there were the following possibilities: reject, reject w/ encouragement
to resubmit, revise and re-review, revise without re-review, and accept (a
virtual impossibility on the first go-round)), even the best humanities
journals (excluding house-journals like PMLA -- a different topic) may
wait THREE OR FOUR MONTHS before the author hears a peep.
 
Sorry, I'm griping.  But I do think that Sokal -- though he's acted
despicably and doesn't understand the cultural study of science -- puts
his finger on a real problem in the humanities review process.
 
One thing the humanities could do is follow science's lead and make peer
reviewing one of those things you count for tenure.
 
Cheers,
David

              May 1996 10:34:53 -0400)
 
I wonder how well the peer-review process as it works in science
applies to humanities scholarship.  We don't have quite the same level
of shared assumptions about what any particular field is, what
important work is, and how it ought to be expressed.  Any well-known
scholarly journal in our field has ideas about what they want to
publish that go well beyond straightforward questions of field,
quality, and importance; or perhaps it's better to say that quality
and importance are defined in very different ways by different
journals.
 
When I think of peer-review horror stories I've heard that related to
the humanities, they generally have to do with work being dismissed,
directly and without supporting argument, as not being serious
humanities scholarship.  And, in the case of any particular journal,
it's certainly easy to think of many approaches, subjects, or writers
that just wouldn't be acceptable.  (The other main focus of these
horror stories is long delays, and generally the slothful rudeness
that is so common in the academic humanities, as David Kellogg rightly
points out.)  Horror stories that have come to me about peer review in
the sciences have turned on deliberate obstruction with commercial
motivation, and involve cases that ended in lawsuits.  (Scientific
fields may be more objective, but there are also large amounts of
money at stake in some of them.)
 
We also read humanities journals, we don't just refer to them.  We
don't have any journals like the Physical Review, which runs to a yard
or so of shelf space for one year; nobody reads it, you just glance at
the subset of articles covering your own little field.  Andrew Ross's
account of deliberations at Social Text points out one thing that's
true about many humanities journals: you don't just take the top
twenty best articles each year, you select articles in part because
they fit together.
 
In the Social Text case, you can certainly question the stated
justification for the editors' publication of an article they thought
was weak---I also find it condescending; but you can't plausibly claim
that these people don't know cultural studies and couldn't judge that
aspect of the article.  (Everyone talks in the popular press about how
the article was obvious nonsense, but most people outside the world of
literary studies would have the same reaction to any article that has
ever appeared in Social Text.)  What opens them to ridicule is
publishing something that claims some kind of scientific support or
connection for these postmodern themes, when the science in the
article was (we're told) bogus.  An outside reviewer from the world of
physics could have given them some idea of whether the physics made
any sense or not, and generally if you're going to publish
interdicsiplinary work you really ought to seek advice on fields you
don't know anything about.

IMHO, Beradino was a great star and a figure of major cultural importance.
Everyone knew he was in failing health and I'm sure the LA Times had a
correspondent with very close connections to Cedar-Sinai where the stars
die.  He had to leave "General Hospital" in 1993 after thirty years,
because he was sick.  Soap opera fans and baseball fans all over the world
are sad that he has died.  Give him the dignity of his name now that he is
dead.  But Aldon, I understand why the disparity between the reportage of
the two entertainers outrages you.  Yet soap opera stars receive less
respect even than the great guitar players of our day.  Why is that?   I
think because their work is perceived as somehow effeminate, decadent, off
the beat.  Ephemeral.  Unrelated to life.

I count three or four months as a good response. I can't even count the
number of times I've waited six, 8, 12, 18 months, & then had the most
bizarre reactions from the journals -- all the way from "we're accepting
it and by the way we need the proofs by tomorrow why won't you call us
back right away," this more than 2 years after initial submission -- to
one-line rejection sentences. One of the least professional parts of
"professional" life I've encountered. My favorite thing is the number of
times journals lose essays mailed to them -- I count on no better than a
75% chance of a journal actually receiving a piece (& have had them
"lost" or "never received" at least six times, including SOCIAL TEXT
itself!) -- never had a credit card payment lost in the mail yet though!
 
And then we could talk about edited volumes (too bad Maria's offline).

Come to think of it, David K's suggestion that peer reviewing count
toward tenure (but aren't there "peers" who aren't tenure-track
professors??) is interesting. But also disturbing. As Steve Fuller hinted
in his letter to the Times today, there is a relatively astounding lack
of professional standards throughout the humanities. I mean, it'd be nice
to *reward* profs for being reviewers; but it'd be even nicer if they
*already* reviewed in a timely and thoughtful way, considering that it's
a relatively clear part of their professional duties (that is, if they've
accepted the role as reviewer on a journal in the first place).
 
Whoops! I'm gripin' too.

Here, here, Kevin!
 
I have an old black and white photo of my mom with John Beradino walking a
picket line together (i think in front of ABC-TV, Los Angeles).  I always
thought he was cool just because of walking the lines in support of what must
have been an electrical workers strike (as my dad was vp of the IBEW in
Hollywood at that time (late 1960's)).
 
thanks Kevin, i didn't know that that was who Aldon was referring to.

Subject:      Re: Re Refereed Journals
 
I'm sorry, but this is one of those times upon which I have to disagree
with Marjorie. Maybe it is because I am more interested in writing than in
scholarly criticism, but my experience with literary / critical journals
over too many decades to be cheerful about, is that the more interesting
writing has come from journals that are cranky, perhaps, run by devotees
rather than committees, have an exe to grind, and last a lot shorter time
that PMLA. I dont think that Pound's essays, or Williams's, or Stein's,
would ever have passed a group of referees. Yet essays full of
brain-numbing jargon do so every quarter. When referees read refereed
articles (and yes, I have been a referee), they tend to favour something no
more interesting than their own articles.

Subject:      Ref them journals
 
Marjorie,
 
I haven't been as articulate as I would like to have been. I don't
think that the issue with journals is or should be one of fairness, but
rather one overall of providing the greatest value to the reader -- and
that I would argue can only come from a journal that presents a
distinct point of view. It almost doesn't matter whether it comes from
a clique (as in Social Text, SAQ, or the journal Bill Luoma likes to
call Reputations) or a single person (Clayton Eshelman, say, or even
Bly in The Fifties and Sixties, or Corman in Origin, or Bernstein &
Andrews in L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E or or or...). And, having worked on
Socialist Review, it's not that I'm setting myself off as any better
than anyone whose worked in a collective editorial process, regardless
of the method. But publications like Contemporary Literature are
ultimately lowest-common-denominator ventures. It's built into their
structure.
 
I never will buy a magazine because it has just one article that I'm
interested in -- and almost by definition, publications like CL never
will have two, so I end up never reading them. Give me Mirage
#4/Period(ical) any day of the week. I always know that Kevin and Dodie
will give me several things worth reading--and often from people whose
names I don't know or recognize (yet). In the long term, that's where
the value is -- and it's the likes of Kevin and Dodie who should be
getting the insitutional subsidies to make their work easier.
 
But, as a few folks have noted, there is more than a mere discursive
difference between cultural publications and ones in the "hard"
sciences. I wouldn't want Andrew Ross operating on my heart!!
 
All best,
 
Ron
 
P.S., hey, I like the Orioles, though I think it's time that Cal Jr.
think about switching to third or even (a la Ernie Banks) to first. And
(to complete the threading of current topics) Johnny Berardino, as he
was called when he played in the majors, used to be with the Orioles'
predecessor St. Louis Browns. He was their starter from '39 to '42 and
then again after he returned from the war in '46. His best year was
probably 1940, when he hit 16 home runs and drove in 85 RBI. He was a
shortstop in some years, second baseman in others and, after '46, was
pretty much a utility player. Batted and threw right handed. Lifetime
BA. of .249. I saw one obit that referred to him as "leading the
Cleveland Indians to their one World Series victory but he only played
66 games in 1948, batting just .190. Typical "good hands" infielder,
sort of what you look for in a surgeon, no?

Subject:      refereed, non-refereed?
 
Of course, there's no such thing as a non-refereed journal, there are
simply different types and degrees of refereeing. At the very least,
SOMEONE had to agree to accept a given piece, even if they didn't read it.
 
But I don't think the issue is whether one imaginative editor can accept
more risky work than a committee, or that a committee allows for more
thorough reading of a text. Instead, I think the issue has to do with the
POLITICS of contemporary humanities publishing. I think Ron Silliman is
right about the value of imaginative editors, given our current
environment, at least to the extent that many of
the most insightful essays on contemporary poetics will not appear inside
a normative academic publishing environment. Why? Charles Bernstein's
recent essay "Tone Lock" has the answers to that question, and I hope
that he'll forward that essay to the list, or tell people where it's
otherwise available.
 
        The essential point of Charles' essay, which he can make more
eloquently than I can, is that contemporary "refereed" journals allow,
with very few exceptions, for only one kind of critical TONE--that of the
dispassionate, objective, scientific "observer"--and this is usually true
no matter how much the critic in question would critique any of the above
terms. That is, it's not simply that contemporary referreed journals
publish "experts," but that there is a language that expertise must speak
in order to be considered expertise. As long as that is true, the
most interesting articles will be published by journals who can exist
outside the "refereed" environment, that is, outside an environment that  is
not value-free  and chooses the most interesting articles, but rather is an
environment that determines in advance that one tone, and one tone only,
is proper for the expert.
 
        Of course, there are exceptions which make the issue more
complicated. Boundary 2 used to publish a variety of interestingly
"alternative" format essays until its original editor, the vastly
underrated William Spanos, passed it along to the slick and professional
emptiness of Paul Bove. Before that, all sorts of things used to happen
in Boundary 2. And another area of exceptions is that people like Charles
Bernstein, who have acquired enough "cultural capital" that they HAVE to
be listened to by people who would prefer to ignore them, often do get to
publish alternative format essays in "refereed" (read: TONE LOCKED)
journals. But from my own firsthand experience, Charles' work is often
not taken seriously as criticism precisely because people look at the
alternative format of his work and so "oh, he's just a poet"--i.e. he
succeeds in writing against the grain at the cost of being considered an
"expert" at all in many normative academic environments.
 
        For my own money, the most interesting poetics essays in recent
years have all been published in journals that exist outside the refereed
environment--Chain, Talisman, Witz, Poetic Briefs, Lower Limit Speech,
Aerial, Taproot, many
others. Essays in those journals are often looser and sloppier, I'll
admit, than those essays in the standard refereed journals. But in
challenging the normative criteria of tone-locked academic journals, they
do provide an environment in which criticism can remain engaged on the
level of TONE, as well as being not totally chained to the variety of
limitations that such tone-lock creates for critical thinking. Of course,
there's no doubt that excellent articles on poetics do appear in academic
journals, but they nonetheless always seem pretty coercively standardized.
 
        At Poetic Briefs, and with Leave Books, having a group editorial
staff never harmed our ability to publish even the most extreme critical
texts--we weren't beholden for our money to the current standardized
practices of academic criticism.
 
        The Leave Books publication A POETICS OF CRITICISM, still
available I believe from SPD, features a variety of critical essays (of
varying degrees of success, I'll grant) that do not have the standard
form of critical essays and nonetheless are being put forward as
criticism. There is almost not a single essay in that collection that
could have been published in a refereed journal, which is proof, I
think, that more needs to be done to challenge the control that tone lock
has over what supposedly constitutes successful critical thinking.
 
        So what's at stake here is not whether one person is better than
a committee, but rather the politics of critical practice--that is, the
problem of who controls the resources and puts forth the standards for
what counts as "acceptable" critical practice.

I think it's true that journals like Contemporary Literature don't have a
distinct point of view--agreeing with Ron Silliman here--but I don't think it's
at all true that a lowest common denominator is "built into" their structure.
If we consider refereed journals not one at a time but within something like
the profession of literary or cultural studies as a whole, it's rather
hierarchy or structured conformity that is the end result.  Such and so--say
our own Alan Golding--will typically be sent articles on contemporary American
poetry by the editors of CL, and they will largely defer to his review.  Now
Alan's own articles--for CL but especially for another journal with a little
more so-called prestige (say Critical Inquiry)--will be refereed by somebody
else who's been around a little longer, who's a little higher in the academic
pecking order.  Say our own Marjorie Perloff for instance.  (Not that Critical
Inquiry cares much for contemporary poetry anymore, or that Marjorie actually
reads for them.)  By the time you get to Harvard UP there's relatively few
people being asked to referee manuscripts.  These are the people who've been
around longest, have the biggest reputations etc.  At the top of the heap
there's--oh I don't know, say Harold Bloom or Helen Vendler--sitting behind
the screen like the Wizard of Oz.  Now this pyramid figure I'm sketching is
overly simplistic--there are actually many pyramids and more freedom of
circulation and movement within them than such a caricature suggests.  And
what some might call conformity here (the results of the profession's referee-
structure) others would call standards.  Distinct or idiosyncratic points of
view do tend to have their edge removed by such a power-structure but not
because a lowest common denominator rules but rather a particular set of
(more or less questionable) standards, methodologies, and interests.  Such
power structures seek to perpetuate themselves, though they also require
contestation and change.  It used to be one of the functions of
non-professional journals like Sulfur to whack away at these orthodoxies
but given the hyper-specialization of the humanities and arts today I'm not
sure that that's happening very much, or rather that anyone not already
predisposed to read Sulfur (or other similarly-edited journals) is paying
much attention.  On the other hand we do have people like Marjorie--who must be
asked to review a thousand manuscripts a year--moving between zones in a useful
way.  Sorry--all this could be clearer. I'm sympathetic to Ron's point, but
I can't accept this "lowest common denominator" formulation.  And in
comparing L=A=N=G=U=A=G-E and Contemporary Literature we're also comparing
apples and kiwi. Both of 'em necessary in a healthy diet.

I normally would agree with Rid that Andrew does good work, etc. -- BUT,
if what he says in the first two paragraphs of his response is an
accurate reflection of the real discussion among the editorial board of
his journal, then the journal should damn well go out of business -- How
can anyone justify publishing an article that they believe is inadequate
(meanwhile, I prseume, rejecting any number of quite interesting and
well-constructed unsolicited essays [try "presume"] from non-physicists)
is beyond me --
 
On the other hand, I cannot understand why blind editorial review should
be considered obnoxious -- If it were not for blind review (the VERY FEW
places where the blindness is real, and not an editorial fig leaf) those
of us who do not happen to have gone to graduate school with the editors
would be out in the cold forever --
 
Take a gander, by the way, at the list of people who got tenure track

A Few Banalities and Animadversions from Hawaii
 
Some of you may have read the essay by Bruce Robbins in a recent *Social
Text* (45, Winter 1995) called "Some Versions of U.S, Internationalism" in
which Bruce Robbins (Andrew Ross's co-editor at the ST "Editorial
Collective") tried to map out the cultural-politica differences of
globalization/localization tactics ("adversarial internationalism") of
four differently situated U.S. cultural studies journals-- Diaspora,
boundary 2, Social Text, and Public Culture in that order-- and re-ground
these tactics in the US geopolity/state/civil society domains of
discourse-production.
 
Such a push to draw a 'cognitive map'for the emerging collective vision of
each journal was helpful and cautionary, especially for one such as myself
who has attempted since 1989 as 'advisory editor' to push b2 into
"Asia/Pacific" reaches and to pressure the local resistance/local poetics in
any globalization visions of capitalist restructuration.
 
  While I found Bruce's overall vision of 'transnational capital' rather
appallingly user-friendly and overforgiving, and his reading of the
quasi-Marxist globalism of b2 off the mark re what he took to be its
Euroamerican rationalism cum 'romanticization of the local' as site of
contemporary resistance (thus getting the global/local dialectics of b2
wrong on both counts), I was startled at how he explained and justified
(trumping b2 as it were) the cultural politics and commodity-culture
rooted populism of Social Text (in its contemporary moment), with one ear
tuned to the streets and the other to the capitalist poetics of the
corporate board room as he said.
 
Robbins explained the political edge of the "culturalism" of Social Text
in the following terms (p.102):  "as one instance of what has been called
culturalism, it tries to colonize and assimilatate authoritative
discourses that claim not to be culture by identifying them as cultural
constructs and revealing the social interests hidden behind them, as the
titular notion of the social-as-text suggests."  As an embrace of 'popular
culture,' furthermore, ST turns against entrenched hierarchies,
escpecially of expertise-guarding elites.  I have no problem with the
latter tactic, but I am startled by the 'colonizing' reach of this ST
'culturalism' into and across all domains of knowledge and into the very
subatomic reaches of understanding and the real as such.  Do we want such
an over-extended "culturalism"?  What kinds of practics and values and
discourses will such a vision generate: an "antifoundationalism" towards
what (neopragmatic/liberal US ends)?
 
Shaking the foundations of professional expertise at and around ST, Sokol
is now accused of having written a sophomoric 'fraud' and having violated
the very professional ethics and professional decorums that sustain such
expertise knowledge communities (Stanley Fish,predictably, in his Oped
take-out so-called Sokol piece); but what the NYU professor of physics has
actually written is not so much 'fraud' as a parodic miming of the pomo
cult codes (some of his footnotes are pretty hilarious) and a sending up
of an over-extended 'culturalism' colonizing domains of
reality/history/material production and reproduction where it may just
fall apart or become wishy-washy and inadequate.
 
That ST editors ex post facto can now claim (via AR on WWW) that they knew
all along it was a 'sophomoric' piece of cultural studies by a naive
scientist; that ST is never 'refereed' (what is the in-house critical
collective but a set of primary discrimination makers of the in/out,
enacting [sure, informally] the rules for what passes as any "Social Text"
text); and that the Sokol essay was going to be dropped from the expanded
book edition at Duke UP (this would be an unusual post facto decision to
make, as Duke UP usally runs all the essays and whatever else the editors
choose to add from its journals "special issues," within space limits of
course), sounds like more critical two-step shuffle to me: why not admit
to having been deceived and worked from the insights and struggles of that
moment?  Sure, it's a postmodern black hole now:  That a pro-Sandinista
physicist can be embraced as an ally by Rush Limbaugh on right-wing talk
radio and be stimulated by the "Higher Superstion" faction of
anti-pc-construction science to write such a piece just plays into the
spectacle of media reductions-- some at b2 have suggested this will only
drive up the subscription lists of ST and generate more cultural capital
and "science war" discourse for the players (if they don't fall or leap
from NYU windows and fall upward, "deconstructing postmodern gravity,
slyly") and the press.
 
Despite this Ross/Sokol fiasco, ST remains an inventive and important
cultural studies journal; it has provided timely critiques of
'postcolonial discourse' machine and affiliated itself with domains of
popular culture and transnational critique we need to know of in NYC to
Seoul.  Ross, eg, has done astonishing work on the cooptation of local
Pacific culture in Hawaii by the Polynesian Cultural Center (Mormon
"culturalism") and the political ambiguities of Hawaiian sovereignty
struggle in "Chicago Gangster Theory of Life:  Nature's Debt to Society."
But Sokol has, I think, caught Ross and the ST "Star Wars" discourse
apparatus in an over-extension of their 'culturalism,' miming the codes in
devious simulacrous ways that reflect and refract where the journal is
philosophically at.  As somebody has said, under such pressure, the
"subject position" is oozing into "position(s)."
 
boundary 2 is no set of holy rollers, to be sure, and the "critical
collective," post-Spanos, practices its own methods of inclusion/exclusion
and discursive maneuverings on US academic turf:  I will say that, since
the editorship of Paul Bove, each submission is screened initially by him,
sent out to another reader on the critical collective, and, if the
interest is there given two or three reader's hard-hitting reports to
suggest ways to revise and strengthen. Hard stories on
rejections/omissions/sins of commission may abound still. But "special
issue" prjects (such as forthcoming one to be edited by Charles Bernstein,
like one in the past and another by Arif Dirlik on "Postmodernity in
China") enact ways to cut across in-house boundaries and knowledge domains
of areas/disciplines/ professional expertise.
 
The b2 editorial collective is not perfect, to be sure, but it remains
"Gramscian" at core in the ongoing and multi-sited attempt to forge a
counter-hegemony to the injustices and imperfections of capitalism in its
colonizing transnational/local reach.
 
The St fiasco should give us pause on how such journals procede and what,
in truth and trope, they finally stand for inside/against US "collective"
struggle.

Many departments DO, in fact, "count" work as a journal ref., but rather
modestly, under the heading of professional service -- I'm not sure I'd
want to see it go much farther than that -- do we really want tenure
committeess passing judgement on the quality of the work we do passing
judgement?
 
Bigger problem to me is how these groups of refs. are constituted in the
first place -- Too often winds up, yet again, being a list of the
editors' friends rather than any kind of systematic attempt to convene
scholars who are doing important work in whatever field -- This is
particularly a problem if the work you do opens up new areas (new only to
critics, I hasten to add) -- for example -- when I write about avant
garde black poets -- my work is typically sent to some freind of an
editor who is "in" African-American literature, but who hasn't read three
poems in the last year -- OR to some "specialist" in poetry, who hasn't
read any poetry by black writers (perhaps excepting Brathwaite &
Brooks?!?)  post WWII --
 
It's NOT that there are too few scholars working with this poetry; it IS
that too few editors can trouble themselves to find out who they are --
 
AND, as radically democratic as I tend to be, I've found the words
"editorial collective" to mean, generally, abandon any hope of democratic
openness ye who submit here --

I do agree with Ron, of course, that literary journals are much better,
livelier, etc. if they have a point of view.  But journals like Sulfur,
Language, Poetics Journal, Talisman, etc etc. aren't sponsored by
university presses, don't pretend to be run by an "editorial collective"
and all that.  When a journal is a kind of house organ at a particular
university (e.g., Critical Inquiry, New Literary History, Diacritics),
with a board made up of people both within and without said university,
then there's some responsibility to reach out and include unknowns who
might just submit a brilliant article.
What I objected to was Ross's saying that all the articles in sT are
invited, commissioned.  That seems to me not Kosher.  And when he went on
to say that, hey, Alan Sokal was someone "we didn't even know," as if,
well, then he must be some suspicious type, I do cringe.
 
Incidentally, at U-Wash, where I just spent a delightful two days at a
Comp Lit colloquium, a grad student finally gave me the Sokal article and
I think it's even more amazing than I would have believed.  Fabulously
done and utterly devastating.  He is constantly praising Ross and
Aronowitz and subtly working in their statements into his physics rap.  It
is truly in line with Swift etc.--a brilliant piece of work.  Read it!

Dear Poetics List-ers:
 
A question came up on a book arts list, wondering about small presses &
private presses & related activity in Ireland. If anyone here knows of such
activity and where to find it, please post information to me (chax@mtn.org)
so I can forward it to that list and help some travelers. This would include
small literary & non-literary presses, particularly (but not limited to) any

thanks for reproducing the Sokal letter -- this makes one thing stand out
clearly --
 
Ross says that the ST editors tried to get some changes made in the
article, and that the author refused to make such changes --
 
Sokal says that he asked for editorial advice, but that all he received
was an acceptance letter --
 
One need not adhere to a correspondence theory of truth to recognize that
at least one of these letters is wildly misleading --
 
this much is serious indeed and ought to be aired in public

David Wilk, after Truck and after his stint as head of Literature at the
NEA, in about 1982 or 83 founded Inland Books in East Haven, Connecticut. I
heard that Inland within the last year has been through one or another stage
of bankruptcy proceedings and has been to some degree reconstituted as
Inbooks (perhaps spelled InBooks?). As Inland, and continuing as InBooks,
they distribute some small press literary books. I didn't have good luck
with them for Chax books, and discontinued sending them books several years
ago. When I began making books, however, David Wilk was immensely helpful to
me, and I wish him very well. I have two addresses, but remember, both of
them are some years old, and you might want to find some directory which is
more current. But here they are:
 
P.O. Box 120261
East Haven, CT  06512
(203) 467-4257
 
and/or
 
140 Commerce Street
East Haven, CT  06512
 
 
As far as any Truck archive goes, I'd certainly suggest asking David Wilk.
As a journal, I'm not certain when Truck published its last issue. As a
distributor (Truck Distribution), when David Wilk went to the NEA in the
late 1970's he sold Truck Distribution (reportedly for a cup of coffee, but
perhaps that's apocryphal) to Jim Sitter, who re-named it as Bookslinger.
When the ten or so best-selling, largest producing presses pulled out of the
non-profit Bookslinger in the late 1980's (my chronology is by memory here)
to go with the for-profit Consortium Book Sales & Distribution, which was
begun by someone leaving Bookslinger & attracting those presses away,
Bookslinger hung on with difficulty only due to the hard-working and
much-caring hands of Rod and Hanje Richards, but finally went under in 1993.
With the increasing professionalization of distribution for a dozen or so of
the biggest small presses in the country, and the nearly simultaneous demise
of Bookslinger and Segue Distribution, most small press distribution was
left to SPD. And while I like SPD, in general small press distribution was
in much better shape 10 or 15 years ago than it is now, except for the very
largest of the small presses. There are many reasons for this, including the
demise of indepent booksellers, the rise of chain book superstores, the
difficulties of funding for distribution, general trends in the economy, and
more.
 
But this is more than you asked for. Good luck tracking down David Wilk.

Subject:      :re: spanos/post-spanos b2
 
Dear Mark Wallace, I am taking the liberty to write to you out of the
(internet) blue after I saw your comment on the Buffalo "poetics" list re
the way *boundary 2* journal, in past ten years post-Spanos, has moved
away from experimentation of form/tone/genre/language game in the
editorial shift from Spanos to Bove as main editor.  You do have a
clear-hitting case, and perhaps with C Bernstein editing a special issue
of b2 in the near future with an array of interviews and poetic/poem
materials, there can be a chance of reclaiming some of this language area.
But more more should be done on many fronts re the ongoing reinvention of
scholarly/theory/poetics form of discourse in USA outlets. The journal is
much too Northeastern/Atlanticist in its problematics as well
 
When I coedited a special issue of b2 on"Asia/Pacific as Space of Cultural
Production," I used some pidgin and indigneous language poems and some
Pacific cultural works in nonstandard genres (fiction/"Our Sea of Islands"
theory by Hauofa) not only because it reflected key cultural work out in
postmodern Pacific but because (invoking the Spanos precedent), we could
reclaim and reimagine some of those language territories and moves.  The
"slick and professional emptiness of Paul Bove" that you indict may be a
function of how the collective is constituted now and what it sees as
professional and cultural work.  The collective has its own tensions and
devisions re what constitutes "an international journal of postmodern
culture" and literary-critical work.
 
There seems to be almost little to no interest in poetry there anymore,
but there is a really interesting packet of materials in next b2 on the Ho
Chi Mih "Prison Diary" poems, showing how cannily critical of Vietnames
transnationalization he was, and using translation forms (by Steve
Bradbury) that expose the ideology of form ("American free verse") of
prior translations (done, for the most part, not from the Chinese but the
French).
 
A lot of the stuff is impossibly repetitive, stale, miming the careerist
codes, so I do appreciate your scathing critique re the "tone locked"
academic form of the essay even b2 has become reified into.  Need to push
on that in ways that Bernstein's "A Poetics" inventively,
heteroglossically, and courageously opens up even in a deadwood press like
Harvard UP american poetics.  Take care, Rob Wilson

1. About the Poetics List
 
Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is
to keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests, and
also to keep the scale of the list small and the volume manageable.
Word-of-mouth (and its electronic equivalents) seems to be working fine.
 
The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein: contact me for further
information. As of May, Joel Kuszai is working with me to administer the
list.  For subscription information contact us at POETICS@UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU
____________________________________________________________________
 
2. Subscriptions
 
The list has open subscriptions.  You can subscribe (sub) or
unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line message, with no subject
line, to:
 
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu
 
the one-line message should say:
 
unsub poetics
 
{or}
 
sub poetics Jill Jillway
 
(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your
name to unsub)
 
We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity.
 
*
If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
 
Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use Eudora
(an e-mail program that is available free at sharewar sites): from the Tools
menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending Mail": you can
substitute your old address here and send the unsub message.
 
The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.  If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increase from
your system administrator. (You may wish to argue that this subscription is
part of your scholarly communication!) You may also wish to consider
obtaining a commercial account.
 
 
____________________________________________________________________
 
3. Who's Subscribed
 
To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail message
blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:
 
  review poetics
 
You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics
subscribers.  This list is alphabetized by server not name.
____________________________________________________________________
 
4. Digest Option
 
The Poetics List can send a large number of individual messages to
your account to each day!  If you would prefer to receive ONE message
each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for that
day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line message (no subject
line) to
                                listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu
 
set poetics digest
 
NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply
to this message!!
 
You can switch back to individual messages by sending this messagage:
 
set poetics mail
____________________________________________________________________
 
5. When you'll be away
 
Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be away
for any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and you may
lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can temporarily
turn off your Poetics subscription by sending a message:
 
You can temporarily turn off your mail by sending a message:
 
set poetics nomail
 
& turn it on again with: set poetics mail
 
When you return you can check or download missed postings from the Poetics
archive. (See 7 below.)

6. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?
 
our URL is
 
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc
 
The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to
serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in
formally innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The Center
provides access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources in the new
poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS
List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts, and direct
connections to numerous related electronic
RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about contemporary print
little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. And we
have an extensive collection of soundfiles of poets' reading their work, as
well as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview series.
 
The EPC is directed by Loss Pequen~o Glazier.
____________________________________________________________________
 
7. Poetics Archives via EPC
 
Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and
year or search them for specific information. Your interface will
allow you to print or download any of these files.
 
Or set your browser to go directly to:

8. Publishers & Editors Read This!
 
PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is open
and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed publications
as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate! Send a
list of your press/publications to
lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press Listing in the subject
line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word processing
program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail message to the address above
to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk. Though files marked
up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your
word processor ill save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is also highly
desirable
 
Send us extended information on new publications (including any back cover copy
and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists (including excerpts
from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to include full information for
ordering--including prices and addresses and phone numbers both of the press
and any distributors.
 
Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check the
EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.  If you have
a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any Poetics posts.
 
Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a
noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your publication
and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting publications.

Today's _L.A. Times_ wieghs in on the _Social Text_ scandal, managing to
codescend to all parties at once -- Identifying Stanley Fish as "the
publisher" of the journal (apparently because the _N.Y. Times_ identified
him as the exec. dir. of Duke U P). Having insulted everybody, they agree
with Fish: "The field of cultural studies may be sluggish in making
progress, it may need to bone up on Strunk & White's "Elements of Style"
and it may have wasted too much energy on such pursuits as studying the
genesis of Tupperware.  But given the cultural misunderstandings that
continue to surround us at home and abroad, surely we can see the
importance of its mission as defined by Fish:"
 
There you have it -- cultural studies as diversity management!
 
And one can't help but wonder what Strunk and White would have to say
about that image of "the field of cultural studies" boning up on their
manual -- just how does a field bone up?
 
To round things out, this editorial is followed by another that
concludes: "No one is suggesting that universities make their best
reseachers teach intorductory chemistry or physics."  Of course, if that
did happen, perhaps a few more professors in our field would realize that
Pi is not a variable.

The Poem of Weeping Ghosts
 
I wept because I had no shoes until I dreamed a man who had a tree.
A rolling tree groped its way past stubbed branches yearning in the night.
A stitch in branches sutured the soul to its repeated self.
Give them their tired wounds yearning for repetition saving nine.
I can be led to runes; I can scoop them up.
Runes heal all wounds of selves repeated branches scraping sky.
Skies repeat skies as definitions of neurosis you can't tell to stop.
The world's neurotic with you; the world's psychotic alone.
Beneath the sun, the silent world is all there is.
Within the silent world a tree falls silently weeping.
Time makes the hearts of trees fall groping.
The weeds are always groping on the other side of the fence.
There, silently weeping, I sit shoeless on the wrong side of the tracks.
There, by Albion, silently being born.

this is Rid speaking:
 
My main point, & this is where the defense of Ross comes in-- The "point" of
Ross's last book can be summed up thusly-- that corporate culture operates
out of the assumption that there isn't enough to go around. It seems more
than reasonable to question this assumption. As long as "the game wins" most
of us won't. This is what you won't find much, or any discussion of at NYT &
co. So given the relative power of Social Text vs the times it's important, I
think, to ask why _this_ issue for the Times & not another.
 
The discussion on this list so far wld not be that different had the Sokal
story been on the cover of AWP.

Comments: To: chax@MTN.ORG
 
dear charles alexander:
 
an introduction to what's happening in ireland can be found in the march
issue of American Bookseller, the publication of the american
booksellers association; i'm sure they would fax you the article if you
called them at 800-637-0037
 
or ask for Dan Cullen, the managing editor there, who fancies himself an
Irishman.
 
i do a lot of reading in irish poetry; it's a fabulour pasttime for many
reasons, but one of which is that the  place of  poetry in ireland is
almost a metaphor for expression in a cultural/historical context: it is a
neat metaphor, by which i mean ireland can be grasped, the tradition is
small, workable; and continues with a certain focus (there are only 3
million people in ireland); it has an original bardic history (poetry in irish
bing perhaps the oldes vernacular spoken art in europe) and has its
language of the victor, english, making language a particulary bloody site
of cultural conflict. and ireland, being the wessternmost outpust of
eurpoean civilication is still (relatively) unchanged racially and culturally
(though my no means unchanged).
 
one way i keep in touch with books irish is through a website from
kennys bookshop in galway; they will send you monthly postings of
new books and you can order from them.

If the weeping ghosts poem is a sonnet, then what does sonnet mean?
Apparently a poem in 14 lines and/or a poem that its author chooses to call a
sonnet.
IS it good and useful for poetics as a field to ahve its terminology become SO
open in meaning that a term like sonnet ceases to carry much information?
 
By the way, after much thought, and largely in response to the passioante and
fascinating debate we inspired on this list, Kathrine (coeditor) and I have
decided we want to open the forms anthology to any experimental forms,not just
chants and others that repeat the typical language elements, but any, ANY, so Iv   so i
reiterate the earlier request for people to edit sections (CONSISTING of a
brief intro describing how the form works and several pages (5-6?) of represe
ntative examples of the form).  PLEASE, contact me to propose such sections on
any form you desire to work with.  IN response to the previous request, I got three
sestinas(!) and nothing else--but we would really like someone(s) to edit
sections on forms we haven't thought of before, even forms that may not be
formal by the "conspicuous repetition" definition.  So please come
forward--I'll send you detailed guidelines when I hear from you.

Yes, it is.  If the term sonnet tells you too much about what to expect in
the poem, the poem itself becomes superfluous.  Why read another bloody
sonnet if it's just going to do exactly the same as all the other sonnets?
The word sonnet is always going to carry some information, why not play with
that, stretch the boundaries of possibility?
 
I'm not at all anti-form, but when I work in one, I want the form and myself
to TRANSform each other.
 
Alan, "Weeping Ghosts" is a beautiful poem.  Thank you for posting it.

Right.  The type of journal makes all the difference.  The inside cover of
Social Text has all the apparatus of a peer-reviewed journal (submit
essays in triplicate to such-and-such address in this form), and there's
in fact nothing to indicate otherwise.  (Nor to indicate that you're
probably wasting your time, since everything's solicited anyway).
 
Seriously now: all of us can tell the difference between Talisman and
Contemporary Literature, and the fact that Talisman happens to be livelier
doesn't meant that CL should stop being peer-reviewed.  With regard to
Social Text, Ross's claim that the journal isn't peer reviewed is an
obvious attempt to escape responsibilty for publishing an article that
nobody on the board (or collective) cared to engage seriously.

Lately there's been a lot of emails on the Sokal debate.  Unfortunately, it
seems I've picked up the threads halfway through, so I'm not even sure what
the story is, although it sounds mighty interesting.  Can someone please give
me a brief summary so that I can follow this apparently juicy subject?

Caroline,
 
I just picked up a copy of _Marine Snow_ at Talking Leaves bookstore in
Buffalo for $12.00 (US). You can order by mail from Talking Leaves. I've
misplaced the store's address but maybe somebody in Buffalo can provide it.
Of course, it was probably the store's only copy, so you might be better off
going directly to the press as Charles suggested.
 
My copy of MacCormack's _Quill Driver_ (Nightwood Editions, probably
available from SPD) has neither a publication date nor a copyright date in
it. I think it came out between _Straw Cupid_ and _Quirks & Quillets_, but
it might be more recent. If you don't already have them, I highly recommend
them also.
 
I just got back from a camping trip or I would have responded sooner.
 
Best,
Jonathan Brannen

As someone recently excused from a jury panel--having admitted writing
poetry, and surviving the discussion of poetry pursuant to that
admission--I would ask counsel to supply the hidden parameters in her
definition of 'sonnet' to be acknowledged by the clerk--and registered as
evidence--for it is this counsel's position that the poem in question,
'poem of weeping ghosts in sonnet form', may or may not be a sonnet, but
may never be 'apparently' anything until all parties have produced
evidence.

Since when do sonnets have to be 14 lines long? I've seen lots of them that
are 11 or 12.

AVEC SALE
 
 
A special sale for subscribers to the Poetics List and internet
users: for $14 you will receive: AVEC #4, which contains part two of
a translation section of contemporary poetry and prose from France
(most of the work is still unpublished in book form and unavailable
elsewhere). It also includes work by Michael Palmer, Lyn Hejinian,
Clark Coolidge, Laura Moriarty, Leslie Scalapino, an image and text
piece by Johanna Drucker, art by Susan Bee, and cover art by New York
School painter Norman Bluhm.
 
Also: Avec #8. With this issue the journal began featuring longer
sections of work per contributor, some of whom are: Elizabeth Willis,
Sianne Ngai, Chris Stroffolino, Agnes Rouzier, Friederika Mayrocker,
Kieth & Rosemary Waldrop, and the award-winning photo-text collboration
by Norma Cole and Ben E. Watkins.
 
And finally: A Cast of Tens by David Bromige. The 29th book by the 1988
winner of the Western States Book Award.
 
     "Bromige is a master at probing the irreducibilities of symbolic
     logic, and his playful yet outrageous equivalencies explode the
     neat, cut-and-dried tautologies of Wittgenstein: "The old man is
     112 pages long / and so is the sea / They are deeply symbolic
     (psychotic)." Bromige's structures are sinuous and mathematic,
     and they evoke the tonal colors of Schoenberg, Satie, or Cage,
     successfully evading what Bromige has characterized as iambic
     pentameter's "echoic invasions."--Taproot Reviews
 
     "Bromige combines the erudite with the dryly humorous."--The Independent

Annie:
 
1. Just as a metrical pattern can be played against until the pattern
becomes almost unrecognizable except in terms of perpetual modulation,
so the *idea* of a particular form can supplant its normal technical
demands of the poem--especially after hundreds of years, when said
form might well be presumed to be sufficiently in place.
 
2. Sometimes the word *haiku* is employed to merely to suggest a succinct
poem, often comprised of a single sentence, which makes use of, or
parodies, (as in senryu, really a variation, if I recall correctly, of
the tanka) stylized concrete observation.
 
3. Just so, a sonnet can be seen purely in terms of its formal argument,
compression, contour, diction, or play on any of these. Likewise, I
would argue that any poem devoted to the exploration of *any* aspect of
sonnet form may legitimately be called a sonnet in some sense.
 
4. Still, none of this is particularly useful to know if you are
trying to master Shakepearean, Petrarchan, Miltonian, Keatsean (or
Etceterean) sonnet form. I myself like to write what I call
*parallel sonnets* (I can't be the only one who's done this),
in which the the metric is syllabic/accentual (rather than the other
way around) and the simple rhyme scheme is as follows:
 
a. abcd abcd efg efg.
 
b. Here is an example, which I present here to show my technical
interest in the sonnet form, a form for which I feel no particular
reverence:
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
         _Parallel Sonnet_
 
 
Her tazed remains electrify the lake,
your Gamma rays deface our clientele.
I've eyed the sore through diadems of plasma
like silver bottles made of Plutarch's nerves.
 
A whiff of midden hypnotized the hick:
his face expanded like a parasol.
The mandibles of corpses belch miasmas,
tinting the wind in which a cinder swerves.
 
Go home, erased equestrian, tapeless worm.
You tongue the twelve-inch someone wants to type.
To err is Hume, the shell-game is the switch--
 
or else the verb assasssinates its form.
The glove reverts to thumb, the trill to strip
of chins in pails, that itch to drop in pitch.
 
 
                     (orig. published in Cups Magazine, 1989)
 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Hope this helps.
 
All the best,
 
Rob Hardin
 
 
PS: I've done a ridiculous number of experiments in Greek meter,
acrostics using medieval classical/contrapuntal techniques and
irregular stanzaic patterns, neo-Campionesque quantitative verse,
my own versions of Augenmusik, etc. I'd regard all of these as
hopelessly anal if I didn't weren't addicted to the medieval
period and its cerebral, almost arbitrary approach to
questions of musical form. Thus, I'd love to submit work
to your forthcoming anthology of form(al) poetry.

sonnet form may legitimately be called a sonnet in some sense.
 
4. Still, none of this is particularly useful to know if you are
trying to master Shakepearean, Petrarchan, Miltonian, Keatsean (or
Etceterean) sonnet form. I myself like to write what I call
*parallel sonnets* (I can't be the only one who's done this),
in which the the metric is syllabic/accentual (rather than the other
way around) and the simple rhyme scheme is as follows:
 
a. abcd abcd efg efg.
 
b. Here is an example, which I present here to show my technical
interest in the sonnet form, a form for which I feel no particular
reverence:
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
         _Parallel Sonnet_
 
 
Her tazed remains electrify the lake,
your Gamma rays deface our clientele.
I've eyed the sore through diadems of plasma
like silver bottles made of Plutarch's nerves.
 
A whiff of midden hypnotized the hick:
his face expanded like a parasol.
The mandibles of corpses belch miasmas,
tinting the wind in which a cinder swerves.
 
Go home, erased equestrian, tapeless worm.
You tongue the twelve-inch someone wants to type.
To err is Hume, the shell-game is the switch--
 
or else the verb assasssinates its form.
The glove reverts to thumb, the trill to strip
of chins in pails, that itch to drop in pitch.
 
 
                     (orig. published in Cups Magazine, 1989)

Hope this helps.
 
All the best,
 
Rob Hardin
 
 
PS: I've done a ridiculous number of experiments in Greek meter,
acrostics using medieval classical/contrapuntal techniques and
irregular stanzaic patterns, neo-Campionesque quantitative verse,
my own versions of Augenmusik, etc. I'd regard all of these as
hopelessly anal if I weren't addicted to the medieval period and
its cerebral, almost arbitrary approach to questions of musical
form. Thus, I'd love to submit work to your forthcoming anthology
of form(al) poetry.

This is certainly a critic's understanding of form and
not a poet's. Even Pound was perversely fascinated with
the technicalities of form--let alone those who dogmatically
assert that a poet must be "free" of "external" formal constraints.
Such a preoccupation is to formalism what Satanism is to
Christianity--belief by the back door.
 
(Will I get the neither/nor lecture again for using parallelism here?)
 
To understand from within *and* from without--surely
this must be the best of both worlds.

Subject:      ebr special issue: visual narratives
 
        Call for Papers
 
ebr, the electronic book review <http://www.altx.com/ebr/>, is now
soliciting essays, visual projects and reviews for its upcoming issue on the
interaction of narrative and image in print and electronic media.  We're
open to essays in combination with online visual projects that deal with any
aspect of narrative (narrative theory, cultural criticism, politics, etc.).
We are especially interested in works that perform the ideas they articulate
and would most like to see submissions that could do so on-line. Specifics
and possible starting points are given below.  Please address all
correspondence to both guest-editors, Steve Tomasula (Tomasula.3@nd.edu) and
Anne Burdick (ABINCITE@aol.com).  Deadline for finished work: November 1, 1996.
 
Part I, Ars Fabula (Narrative and Image)
In this section of the issue, we hope to showcase essays in which the visual
component of a narrative is germane to its interpretation.  The emphasis
should be on narrative; that is, we are not interested in the artist's book
that is concerned with purely formal or material considerations:  the book
itself as art object.  However, we are very interested in the artist's book
that integrates materials and formal concerns in a narrative, especially as
these may influence interpretation or structure specific, alternate
"readings."  The works under investigation can take a variety of forms, but
some examples might be: works that use the grid of the page/screen and
typography (in the tradition of Raymond Federman's _Double or Nothing_, Ron
Sukenick's _Out_, Derrida's _Glas_ or "The Double Session"); works that
integrate images as part of the narration, such as William Gass's _Willie
Master's Lonesome Wife_, Rem Koolhaas's _S, M, L, XL_, the Mexican
photo-novella, or graphic novels such as Art Spiegelman's _Maus_; works that
use images as glosses upon the text or conversely books that actually  tell
their stories through images' indirect commentary, e.g. Simon Schama's _Dead
Certainties_, Carole Maso's _The Art Lover_, Julian Barnes's _History of the
World in 10-1/2 Chapters_; signal works in the history of text/image
collaboration, by Fluxus, for example, or the Futurists (Russian and Italian).
 
Essays should deal with some aspect of the interaction of word and image,
i.e., not simply the interaction of two kinds of expression, but of two
different modes of narration, two languages that are absorbed into a third:
the metalanguage of the image/text.  How is such work different from other
types of narrative?  What are its aesthetics?  On what terms is it to be
discussed, interpreted, critiqued?  What are its ramifications?  For
example, if an analysis of point-of-view can reveal modernist epistemology,
what do image-driven text narrations reveal about contemporary culture?  Do
our values, narative theory, aesthetics, language, ideology inhere in Howard
Stern's _Miss America?_
 
Part II, Ars Electronica (Narrative and Electronic Media)
In this section we would like to examine text- and image-driven narration in
the environment made possible by new technologies.  The above criteria apply
to submissions for this category.  However, here we are particularly
interested in stories that can only be told, and essays whose arguments can
only be made, through electronic media.  Thus, if the work under discussion
could have been done in an older medium, it probably isn't right for this
section.
 
More appropriate are issues of literary narration that might have been
sublimated before, or might have been more applicable to the theater, opera,
or film. Again, what do narrative elements such as character or plot or
organization mean in works of multimedia?  What are the poetics of
hypertext?  What is its rhetoric?  What are we to make of the "found art"
aesthetic that has entered into fiction?  Of issues like indeterminacy and
intertextuality?  motion, space, time, interactivity?  What, if anything, is
narration that incorporates contemporary technology working against? Should
we reread Wayne Booth?  J. Hillis Miller?  If  book technology placed
constraints on narrative, what are the constraints of html or the CD-ROM?
Of the computer monitor?  How do these constraints manifest themselves in
electronic narrative, and what difference does it make?
How does all this affect our relationship with the material form.
 
Essays submitted to ebr should take up some aspect of "reading," but reading
in a narrative that is also able to incorporate sound, images, video,
hotlinks, interactivity.  Emphasis should be on aesthetics or narratology or
cultural context: the ramifications of a medium that forces us to rethink
poetics.  Of course, essays that contextualize or historicize media-driven
narratives are also welcome.
 
 
III  reVIEWS
As always, ebr is interested in reviews of art works, graphic novels, hyper
novels, performances, recent conferences, or stories that relate to the
above two themes.
 
 
        Who We Are
 
ebr is an electronic book review, an online forum allowing critical writers
to present their work on the Internet.  We are committed to reviewing
(literally, seeing again) every aspect of book culture--fiction, poetry,
criticism, and the arts--in the context of emerging media.  At the same
time, ebr is a review of electronic books, promoting translations and
transformations from print to screen, and covering literary work that can
only be read in electronic formats.  To facilitate print/screen
collaborations, and as a service to writers whose primary domain is print,
ebr plans on sharing reviews with various print journals.  Our first two
issues have appeared as focuses of _The American Book Review_, and
particular essays are scheduled to appear in various academic and mainstream
journals (including _Harper's Magazine_).  We'd be interested in hearing
from editors who would like to discuss arrangements for sharing reviews in
the future.
 
 
        Guidelines
 
For future issues, we are soliciting critical writing not only on, but in
hypertext.  We are interested especially in exploring narratives whose logic
is as much visual as verbal, and we prefer thoughtful overviews, polemics,
and review essays to evaluations of single works.  Authors are encouraged to
mark up their essaysin html and, if possible, to put them up at their own
web sites for us to download.  Otherwise, you should send us hard copy and a
disk (preferably formatted for IBM machines).  If you use a Mac, please
format the disk for pc use, and save an additional version as a text file.
 
Essays should follow the general format of the essays and reviews that have
appeared in ebrs 1 & 2.  While we have no proscriptions against specialized
language or scholarly rigor, we request that endnotes be kept to a minimum
(or that they should be worked unobtrusively into the design of the
screen-page).  Since we are not a peer review journal, we discourage reviews
that simply verify an author's or the reviewer's credentials.  We prefer not
to assign novels to novelists, books of poetry to poets, or academic  books
to professor-critics.  Interdisciplinary work is encouraged when attention
is paid to the methods, values, and professional protocols of each of the
fields under discussion.  References to web sites or online books should be
accompanied by the appropriate URLs.

Subject:      russ/american poetry conf report
 
Still coming down from as the russkies call it the "yekstasy" of the
great Russ-American Poetry Conference in Hoboken.  What to say, it
was magnifique, magnotic, hypnetic, and kenotic.  Even though they
smoke like blowfish, walk out of readings (zey do zis in Russia too),
drink like like glug glug, they are for real.  Dragomoshenko a great
clown, a great performance poet.  Elena Shvarts in a class by herself
- americans have yet to dive into this cosmos of a 4-ft tall
Petersburg wonder.  Seems appropriate that this get together happens
under friendly auspices of many american "EXERPERMENTIL" AND
"LINGEWOGE" type poets since pure products of america go crazy and
lignuohodge poetry is pure american crazy-talk (another great
gift to me was to hear some of them read out loud, Bruce Andrews,
Jackson Mac Low, Rod Smith, Leslie Scalp-yr-hindo, many another)...
but ironically these russkies are still very representative of their
own traditions - branching out from them toward us - and that
style is so DIFFERENT from us - as Shvarts told me (she likes to
be provocative) Americans spend a long time getting to what they
want to say & putting all the prep-work into the poem, whereas the
russkies put a kind of finality into their compact poems - one
aspect of this is that often it's all memorized (MORE  than often) -
rhymed, metered, recited - extreme example the incredible Ivan
Zhdanov - "force of nature" from the Altai region - very offhand,
subdued recital of very densely-packed imagery & concept.  Making
no value-judgements here.  The high-energy Americans I heard were
a revelation.  But, well, we come from where we come from, and
I just happen to be a russian poet.
More later maybe - what a storm of interesting purple - endless
gratitude to Ed Foster & gang (if there was a gang) - Gyenri Gyould

Subject:      Re: russ/american poetry conf
 
I only made it to the Friday night readings but agree with Henry that it was a
worthwhile trip. I don't understand Russian so the Russians who read were
interesting mostly for sound and inflection and the reactions of people in the
room who understood them.  (There were some translations: Leslie Scalapino read
in English a portion of Dragomonshenko's poems.)
 
Nathaniel Tarn, Jackson Mac Low, Leslie Scalapino and Simon Pettit all gave
excellent readings.  Can anyone tell me the name of the second Russian reader--
the man who read over a cassette tape of spoken words while drumming into the
microphone? I believe he introduced it as a kind of folk song tradition. I
wanted to understand the language so much!
 
The behavior of the Russians during the reading was of interest to all I was
with.  It seems that whenever a Russian read, all (not all, but most of) the
Russians left the room to chat.  And when anyone else read the Russians stayed
in the room and chatted without a hint of self-consciousness.  How do you
translate "when in Hoboken, do as the Hobokians" and why didn't they?
 
Henry wrote: "Dragomoshenko a great clown, a great performance poet."
Sometimes, as in this case, I'm not sure what distinguishes the two.  He did,
even if most didn't understand the language he read in, consistently attract
the attention of everyone in the room, even when he was reading.  Can anyone
explain why he entered the room and shouted "yes" and then walked to the
blackboard and wrote "no?"
 
Well, thanks for the account, Henry. It's always useful to get another
perspective of what one saw and heard.

Subject:      Re: Sokal in SoCal II
 
a few more thoughts re the sokal brouhaha, esp. after reading rob wilson's
and others' thoughtful posts:
 
-- there is a journal---as i recall the title, _the journal of
irreproducible results_---that provides a forum for mock-scientific studies
of mock phenomena, playing specifically off of *scientific* jargon and
methodology, and playing specifically to scientists and the
scientifically-inclined... i mention this by way of indicating that sokal's
parody has precedent within scientific discourse communities... of course
this sidesteps the tricky issue of accepting a submission on the basis of
formal criteria alone (please permit me this form/content dualism for a
moment)... but if what sokal did is, as ross calls it, a "boy stunt," it is
also connected with the general ethos of scientific discourse, if only on
this latter's (lunatic?) fringes... an ethos emerging from a long history
of proving, disproving, and, on occasion, offering up false proofs as a
challenge, or for a few laughs---whatever the residual positivism or, as
some would have it, male-adolescent leanings (haven't many of you seen
proofs that 1 does not = 1?)... in any case, i think we oughtta be asking
ourselves whether, when discourses collide, there isn't bound to be some
friction owing to the assumptions each party makes about the nature of
discourse...
 
-- i'm certain there are unreconstructed marxists out there (and mebbe even
a few reconstructed ones) already itching to refer to this hoax as ample
evidence that ludic postmodernism (you've heard this term, yes?) is
consuming itself... that _social text_ is not materialist enough, is not
grounded enough in economic realities, hence is susceptible to the general
foolishness of various postmodernisms (btw, i have serious  doubts that
sokal is familiar with this latter position)... though i'd prefer to read
the ny times publicity itself less as evidence of nasty corporate
constituencies (which are surely at work) than as the public alignment of
right-conservative discourse with american anti-intellectualism in
general... which latter, for me anyway, will not be sufficiently
explained/analyzed through elaboration of needs-based symbolic practices
(i.e., there are always enough words to go around---which i take to mean
there are always more than enough intentions to go around)... but my point
here is that sokal's stunt is likely to draw even more attention to what
constitutes politics per se in leftist discourse, from within related
communities... which may or may not be a bad thing...
 
-- BUT, despite what i've just noted, and contra the good intentions
hereabouts re revising our review practices to make them somehow more
scrupulous, the worst thing that can happen now is for publishers to get
fascist about things (sorry!), for critical journals to be more on their
guard, to demand even more "tone lock" (thanx for introducing charles'
term, mark)... in fact the failure of _social text_ to read sokal's parody
*as* parody may point to the general success of academic discourse in
creating formal/conventional codes that pass, in and of themselves, for
critical insight/knowledge... and this is as true of the left as of the
right, though the right's tightassedness about idiosyncracy in general will
tend to eliminate just about anything out of the orthodox (in more orthodox
venues, that is)...
 
-- the problem in these terms becomes one of finding ways to be even MORE
open, while not being exactly susceptible to bullshit... were the _social
text_ editors more familiar with or open to alternative discourses,
alternative ways of conducting critical/theoretical practice, alternative
readings of critical vs. 'creative' discourse, perhaps they would have
eliminated sokal's parody b/c it was a *parodic* failure, b/c it failed to
open up any new critical (or even scientific) territory as parody (or isn't
this a possibility?)...
 
-- or perhaps not... perhaps (i haven't read it) sokal's article should be
looked at again for what it *does* tell us about its ostensible topic,
mebbe in spite of itself... surely its publication-in-context speaks,
however, to the discursive habits of _social text_ and of the left, as well
as to scientific ethos, "boy stunts," ETC.... but it may well be that
sokal's piece works in ways that neither sokal nor the _social text_
editorial board really understands... or is willing to... just as neither
party seems willing to entertain a more loosely-defined notion of what
constitutes scholarship (ok---in the humanities)...
 
-- the general public response on both sides, as i've heard it, amounts to
both sides laying claim to higher social ground predicated on a similar,
narrowly-defined understanding of what constitutes (good) scholarship
(which latter is itself being understood, convolutedly, in terms of
intention)... here's the options, as presented by each position:  (1) if
sokal sez it's parody, it's mere parody... and b/c they published his
parody, _social text_ and journals of its ilk regularly publish false and
misleading information ...  (2) whether or not sokal sez it's parody, its a
"curio, or symptomatic document" (ross) at best, poor scholarship at
worst... and b/c he submitted a parody under the guise of scholarship,
scientists (like sokal) are hostile to the notion of cultural critique...
 
-- there must be more than two options, two positions (and both positions
as articulated would seem to argue against what is viewed by opposing
parties as a form of intellectual corruption)... it seems to me we oughtta
be looking at more than two ways of looking at sokal's parody, not so much
in formal terms, but in terms of the sorts of formal (-institutional)
constraints implied by its (almost) ipso facto rejection as "good"
scholarship---by both parties (albeit one (apparently) a bit belatedly,
post-publication)...
 
-- so it seems to me, in all, that neither party is being sufficiently
literary... and i say this with [ahem] no due respect for realpolitik...
 
(THIS IS NOT A PARODY, i am a human being...)

Dear Joe Amato, Your analysis of the ST/NYT/Sokal/Ross/Fish event pushes
the oppositions and debates to a trenchant level of anti-intentional
lucidity that may prove helpful:  I admire your support and application of
"the literary" as something that canny and innovative-- to miss this power

quess you made me feel a bit like an "unreconstructed Marxist" (okay by me
at times) barking at the "ludic postmodernity" of discursive flimflam game
and careerist miming (here the lapsed Catholic Marxism of Wilson and Bove
and Pease et al kicks in, seeing "sins" and "crimes" of
omission/commission, deformations of the American subject-ego by
professional self-serving capital).
 
To amp up the moral dimension as such, "Sin" can be a matter of living
with and covertly endorsing the deformations and injustices of capital
because the "symbolic engineers" (Ross to Sokal, no outside to this,
humanities to social science in elite forms) keep winning at this two-tier
language game too (b2 is not outside this at all: Duke UP packing more
"fetish quality per pound" in their books/journals as the NY Times put it
last year in their annual size up the MLA horseshit piece).
 
I am not surethere is anywhere to go with your oppositions though, except
in the same (overdetermined, institutionally constrained) directions?
"Sokal in Socal" gives you some estrangement distance on the event, but
that LA Times editorial was not so helpful in its sermon as your
discriminating "literary" critique.  Regards, Rob Wilson

the poet at the russian/american conference who read/sang over the tape of

in english versions, but there will be a volume of his selected works in
translation published by talisman this fall. he has a quite substantial
reputation in russia, and some of his songs have infiltrated that world
so well that they are sung without the singer's necessarily knowing who

Hi steve!
I'm all for stretching sonnets, but if things are stretched too much they
sometimes start to show holes.  My feeling is that that is starting to happen
with the sonnet. And if it starts falling apart, there will be nothing to
stretch anymore.

Esteemed Jd, right honorable courtiers,
 
It would be tempting to --it is tempting to --paraphrase Housman and say that i
can no more define a sonnet than a terrier can define a r at, but I know one
when I see it.
But that would be simplistic and begging your honorable question. wq. I guess I
would, honestly, define a sonnet as a poem in 14 lines of ip with a
such-and-such rhyme scheme  or any variations of it.  Obviously the variations
are theoretically infinite and shade off into other kinds of poems taht are
not sonnets; I had a very hard time editing a "A FORMAL FEELING COMES for this
reason, but I did feel that there was a difference between the poems that were
actually doignn something, some variation, WITHIN the sonnet form, and those
that were USING the sonnet form for its poignant cultural connotations.
I used the "structured by conspicuous repetition" definition as a way of trying
to codify that difference at the time; now I am becoming more interested in the
philospohical/aesthetic/perhaps even ethical dimensions of the distinction.
 
"Poem of Weeping Ghosts in Sonnet Form" is a marvellous poem that gets a lot of
its marvels from the evocation of the sonnet in the title. Without the title,
as in virtually all of Mayer's SONNETS, the only aspect of the poem evocative
of the sonnet form is the number of lines.
I think the "Poem of Weeping Ghosts" is a poem ABOUT the sonnet, but not a
sonnet.
My definition of the sonnet is a poem that honestly takes on the technical challenges and
lenges and  limitations of the form as it has evolved over the
centuries--always in flux, certainly.
The poststructuralist use of the form seems to me to make a real technical leap into
into a sort of metapoetic use fo the form, in fact a sort of colonization of
it from the outside.  To me such poems are not sonnets, however deeply and
provocatively they engage with the idea fo the sonnet.

I wouldn't worry about it, Annie: everyone in England thought the sonnet
form was exhausted in 1595, and it's still with us 401 years later!

dear rob, how to say this as uncontortedly as possible?... i'm always
feeling as though i can't drop my (theoretical) guard when it comes to
talking theory & (academic and other) institutional realities & such
like... not helped at all by the recognition that even if communication
itself were 100% communicable, this is no guarantee that we'd be any closer
to social justice in any practical sense...
 
anyway:  there's no place to go that's not institutional, no, but that
doesn't exactly or entirely speak to why one writes, or how one writes (as
you know)... i mean, i might be hallucinating at the moment, just imagining
that you're following me hereabouts...  or i may very well be forgoing
dinner to post you, though admittedly it's doubtful that i'm going w/o food
for the night due to lack of pocket money (i would venture that most on
poetics are with me here)... nor does the institutional per se speak to the
contribution one may be making to one's fictional or actual community (term
used advisedly) of readers, if one is or believes oneself to be so endowed
...
 
which i say by way of saying that there's no one way, no one method, no one
aesthetic that works (or that pleases, or that feeds), even if there may
well be causes or platforms or positions or programs that are more
acceptable given corresponding local and global circumstances... and that,
whether utopian or materialist or happy-go-lucky or ?, it may do and do
well to consider alterations in our way of speaking talking exchanging
(letters or pixels), to consider writing against as well as with whatever
grain (incl. the critical), even if doing so does little in in/direct
correlative terms to relieve, for example, human suffering in general... am
i preaching to the choir here?... so then, i preach to the choir...
 
in the critical context, writing and reading with a more literary sense of
the possibilities attendant to same may contribute to (if not result in) a
better social transaction, even a better professional context, provided one
is willing to write and read thus with the understanding that "better"
means tentative, means local, means circumstantial, is a function of how
meaning is made of whatever by whomever; and, yes, may contribute to (if
not result in) worse too, worse so delimited... emphasis on *may*, due
allowance made for systemic-discursive (incl. capitalist and professional)
evils... and due allowance made for (to trope) the paradox of those
artistic practices that speak against any such progress-ive discourse, that
hazard appearing out of step completely with the whole critical shebang
(mself, i'll bump heads with such writers/artists on occasion, but this is
no necessary indication of the quality or usefulness of their writings)...
 
which i guess is just another way of saying that risks must be taken... and
that some we needs to continue to seek and construct ways of developing and
maintaining new and various fora that are conducive to taking risks... that
the literary---and here my particular plug for diverse poetics, along with
diverse publics---that the literary, as a contested site of alphabetic
culture that often operates on and at the margins of experience (and all
that this means under, to steal from your post, current sociocultural
deformations of the subject), may represent not simply a set of
institutional/cultural values of one sort or the other, but ways of
confronting these values with an eye (ok---i) toward understanding the
(often painful) necessity of revaluation...
 
i mean, for those so inclined...

If a thing has holes in it, I think we should know about it.  What's called
"anomaly" in science is called "rebellion" in poetry-- either way
revolutions do happen.
 
The English dumped the Italian sonnet once they realized it's easier to
rhyme in Italian.  American rhymes even less.
 
Besides, once a form's been done, why do it again for anything other than
practice, to prove you can do it?

Dear Rob,
 
I am glad to see your lucid and graceful explanation of how the contours,
argument, diction, compression, and other less quantifiable aspects of the
sonnet form can be "legitimately" engaged (the judicial subtext continues) as a
means of extending the sonnet tradition.
The argument is persuasive and of course intriguing, tempting in its
simplicity: there is no difference, ultimately, in all the different things
that "sonnent" means to us; all can be engaged in, with,  equally, and the form
will still be living.
But I have trouble fuzzing the perhaps-too-obvioius distinction between the
form as commonly understood and its less tangible attributes.  A poem is an
embodied thing, to me, embodied in its actual words, rhythms, stanzas, rhymes,
phrases.  It has a spirit too, but to engage with the spirit seems to me a
definitely different thing than to engage with th e body, just as to engage
with the spirit or idea of a dead or absent person is different than engaging
with the actual living body and presence of the person.
 
I am intaerested in your work on forms and will phone tomorrow probably. Is
there a form you would like to edit a section on, since this is a composite
anthology of different sections on forms?

Dear Steve,
 
Your feeling that the sonnet will still be around no matter how we treat it
reminds me of how people used to feel about the ocean, the ozone, ad the
old-growth forests.  A form is a living thing in my book and needs sustainable
care.

dear Annie Finch --
 
I was startled & delighted to see this coming at the end of one of your
notes & similar but more condensed constructions at the end of others.
Is there a method here too that turns the ordinary into the extraordinary --
something that the machine (in its own way) is trying to tell us?  It is,
anyway, a remarkable statement on sonnets, something that wraps it all up.

"Represent" not simply a set of institutional/cultural values of one sort or
the other, but ways of confronting these values with an eye (ok---i) toward
understanding the (often painful) necessity of revaluation. A contribution
one may be making to one's fictional or actual community (term
used advisedly) of readers, if one is or believes oneself to be so
endowed (academic and other) institutional realities & such like, is
not helped at all by the recognition that even if communication
itself were 100% communicable, this is no guarantee that we'd be any
closer to social justice in any practical sense.
 
Anyway: there's no place to go that's not institutional, no, but that
doesn't exactly or entirely speak to why one writes, or how one writes
(as you know)... i mean, i might be hallucinating at the moment, just
imagining that you're following me hereabouts...  or i might very well be
forgoing dinner to post you, though admittedly it's doubtful that i'm
going w/o food for the night due to lack of pocket. Dear--how to say
this as uncontortedly as possible?--i'm always feeling as though i can't
drop my (theoretical) guard when it comes to talking theory & money (i
would venture that most are with me here)... nor does the institutional
per se speak to the critical context, writing and reading with a more
literary sense of the possibilities attendant to same, per se,
that may contribute to (if not result in) a better social transaction--
 
...
 
--which i say by way of saying that there's no one way, no one method, no one
aesthetic, that works (or that pleases, or that feeds), even if there may
well be causes or platforms or positions or programs that are more
acceptable given corresponding local and global circumstances,
whether utopian or materialist of whatever by whomever; and, yes, may
contribute to (if not result in) worse too--worse so delimited--emphasis on
*may*, due allowance made, for systemic-discursive or happy-go-lucky or ?
 
It may do and do well to consider alterations in our way of speaking
talking exchanging (letters or pixels), to consider writing against as well
as with whatever grain (incl. the critical), even if doing so does little
in in/direct
correlative terms to relieve, for example, human suffering in general...
am i preaching to the choir here?... so then, i preach to the choir...
 
In the even-better professional context--provided one is willing to write
and read that--the literary, as a contested site of alphabetic culture that
often operates on and at the margins of experience (and all that this means
under, to steal from your post, current sociocultural deformations of the
subject), may thus, with the understanding that "better" means tentative,
means local, means circumstantial, is a function of how meaning is made
(incl. capitalist and professional) evils. Due allowance made, i guess this
is just another way of saying that risks must be taken.
 
Us needs to continue to seek and construct ways of developing and
maintaining new and various fora that are conducive to taking risks that
the literary---and here's my particular plug for diverse poetics, along
with diverse publics---for (to trope) the paradox of those artistic
practices that speak against any such progressive discourse, that hazard
appearing out of step completely with the whole critical shebang (mself,
i'll bump heads with such writers/artists
on occasion, but this is no necessary indication of the quality or usefulness
of their writings)...
 
i mean, for those so inclined...

This is good work, Annie, but this is not what I said. There *are*
distinct differences between standard and non-standard sonnets.
But there are subtler classifications to be noted beyond those two.
Some modern sonnets are really "sonnets" (though pomo has rendered
the quotes unnecessary). Much of what is called experimental in the
stricter sense is as patterned and marmoreal as any neoclassical
Dryden. And much of what was written in the transitional stages
of history remains radically experimental to this day.

In a Shakespearean sonnet, syntax, diction and compression
are demonstrably "tangible." A seventeenth-century sonnet can be
analyzed in purely rhetorical terms. Such aspects of the sonnet
might not be *as* commonly understood as its rime-scheme and meter.
But that doesn't mean they are too obscure to be understood.

Would you say that Kandinsky killed, or failed to maintain, the spirit
of representional painting simply because he chose another visual language?
And what about Picasso, who systematically distorted the representational?
Sonata-allegro form crystalized in the work of Haydn, Mozart and early
Beethoven. But what about Beethoven's late sonatas, which were to sonata-
allegro form what post-war Nagasaki is to the original city? Should
Beethoven's late sonatas have been called something else?
 
What about the obsessive mosaic sonatas of Robert Schumann?
And what about the Silent Sonata of John Cage?
Should these have been called something else
because the old forms didn't apply?
 
Isn't the best way to revitalize an old form to write in it
yourself? Why proscribe newer prosodic definitions--why delimit
the do's and better-not's--of *sonnet* for other poets with other
approaches?
 
A free-verse poet might not want to call a poem by another name
than *sonnet*, just as an abstract painter might choose to refer
to a ring of concentric circles and a splotch of paint as _Still Life
#17_. I might debate whether or not the connection, the allusion,
works in each individual case. But that doesn't mean formally allusive
poems are *interchangeable* with Miltonic sonnets. What it means
is this: in modern poetic practice, *sonnet* does not merely refer
to standard rhyme-schemes and forms. If you don't believe me, I
suggest you consult _The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and
Poetics_.
 
(Literal-minded approaches to form? Somewhere, there is a performance
poet who has replaced the sonnet's rhyme-scheme and meter with non-
sequitur facial expressions. Someone else has written sonnet-generating
software. Someone else has built a two-room house in the shape of a
Petrarchan sonnet. After all, the word *stanza* is Italian for *room*.)
 
I appreciate and respect your arguments in favor of preserving the
conventional sonnet. However, I choose to argue in favor of
preserving the *study of prosody itself* rather than some stage of
development within the life of a particular form. I thought
Rothenberg's joke was pretty astute: The train of type at the end
of your post--of leftover cut-and-paste fragments--provided a newer
kind of prosody and another variant of critical perception. Such
accidents are not interchangeable with the sensibility you're
attempting to sharpen. But they are worth looking at. Many
might prove to be important--as have the sequences of freer
sonneteers like Ted Berrigan.

Your analogy that poets who experiment with traditional forms like the sonnet
are simliar to some people's reckless attitude towards the environment is in
poor taste and flat-out wrong. One is NOT like the other no matter how closely
you associate the two.  Actually, the statement is more telling about your own
uptight attitude where poetry is concerned; a denial of change, innovation and
real creativity. (You did not address the point that Steve made.)
 
A poetic form may be a "living thing" but it is not eligible for the endangered
species list. If you are looking to give something "sustainable care" then look
into the global danger surrounding frogs and other amphibians. When these die
out they are gone forever.  When YOUR definition of a sonnet dies out, someone
elses' may still be flourishing.

I'm writing to ask for help:
 
I am slated to teach an interdisciplinary course called "The Twentieth
Century World"; the course is global in scope, and must contain three
areas of intense investigation, three modules.  The "modules" i have
in mind are: Japan, 1912-1917; England 1939-1945; and, Sub-Saharan
Africa from about 1985 or so to the present.
I need to start the course with an overview so that each of the modules
makes sense in context. The readings for the modules are to be primary materials.
I'm wondering if anyone knows of a good, globally oriented, short book or
long essay on the 20th Century I could use for the overview.
Other suggestions, particularly though not limited to the following would
also be welcome: a novel written by someone English during WW II or at least
by someone English about WW II; a contemporary novel written by a Sub-
Saharan African. I've got Japan pretty much covered but would love to have
suggestions there too.  The primary readings are not to be limited to
"high" literature such as fiction. Government documents or whatever from
the relevant period, for instance, are quite acceptable.
 
Any suggestions, then?
 
Gratefully,

I have to go with Daniel Bouchard on this one.  Annie, you get upset when
people equate your literary politics with your social ones, so why resort to
a cheap shot like that?
 
All form is impermanent.  Sorry, but everything changes, and especially
forms made of language, which is perpetually re-created by millions of
people speaking who have different ideas about what's what.
 
A poem-as-living-thing analogy I could buy, but form doesn't exist by
itself, it's always the "form that a poem takes."  If the poem wants to
change its form, that's evolution at work.  If a child is born with 12 toes
instead of ten, we don't say it no longer fits the definition of _Homo
sapiens_ (at least, I hope no one would say so.)
 
To me, form is a means to an end, the end being to create a work that can
engage the psyche at a deep level and make some contribution to its
liberation.  A poem whose only end is to fit someone's definition of a form
is just showing off.  (If I were feeling really pissy, I could draw an
analogy between people who overvalue form and people who have lots of
plastic surgery, but that would put us back into the inappropriate simile trap.)

Juliana--
It's called "walking on colors"-- have students walk a city block or a
country mile paying attention as much as possible to one color of their
choosing, & then write about it. Burroghs talks about this somewhere-- one
thing it can lead to is
a realization that "collage" is the norm, a shared characteristic, a color,
is nevertheless diffuse, inconstant, piecemeal. It's also just an attention

Does anyone have any ones related to the theme/idea of place in particular

Rod Smith gave me a good one from  Burroughs (?) about having people
go out and write down everything they see in a particular color. The

If anyone has any and they back channel them to me, I can post to list

I need ideas and exercises and syllabi. Same thing, if you have, send to me

Subject: Creeley's Place
 
Prompted by recent discussion, I've been happily re-reading Creeley and some
of the critical responses to his work.  One striking fact is that his work
has been respectfully attended to by a wide variety of other poets proceeding
from very different aesthetic stances--everyone from Robert Bly to Thom Gunn,
Donald Hall to Ron Silliman.  To be sure, Creeley's aversion to the heroic
(noted by Silliman, among others), as well as his notably skeptical
intelligence, seem to have helped provoke some penetrating critiques even
from admirers.
 
I find RC's work highly uneven.  Many poems are little biting gems (such as
the renowned "I Know A Man"), while others strike me as mere finger
exercises, opaque or trivial notations.  An instance of opacity, which opens
the poem "To And":
 
     To and
     back and forth
     direction
     is a third
 
     or simple fourth
     of the intention
     like it
     goes and goes.
 
And here's a poem I would call trivial, "A Piece" in its entirety:
 
     One and
     one, two,
     three.
 
Furthermore, critics have well noted Creeley's tendency to dispense with many
traditional elements of poetic appeal, such as figuration, imagery,
narrative, concrete diction, and sensuous richness as found in Roethke or
Thomas (RC's sound-craft is subtle and elusive on its own terms).  Although
his work is intensely intimate, he forgoes confessional revelation almost
entirely.  All these are omissions worth noting with skeptical regard, to my
mind.
 
But so what?  The compensating virtues are certainly abundant, and equally
worth examination.  One possible way into such a discussion is this.  Lately
I have been pondering RC's affinity with a range of writers beyond the usual
Black Mountain suspects.  For if as some have argued his work is central to
our time, don't we need to look at how he stacks up against poets outside the
Pound/Olson/Williams current?  Such judgments as I have just leveled above
(that many poems are trivial or opaque, e.g.) do presume an intention
evidently not acknowledged by RC, for whom the poem seems not so much an
artifact as the product of an exploratory process.  The poem's aim is
improvisation, not just its means.
 
Putting it in these terms, then, makes me want to connect Creeley's work to
that of A.R. Ammons, Adrienne Rich, and William Stafford--all of whom,
despite obvious differences, appear to share commitment to an improvisatory
poetics.  (I see other affinities with poets as distinct as William Bronk and
W. S. Graham.)  Ammons and Stafford, in particular, have seemed to many
readers to commit too many trivial or opaque notations, insufficiently
winnowing wheat from chaff.  Formally and thematically, all these poets seem
to make a central concern the limitations of language to capture or express
what we most want it to; and all are very skeptical of heroic rhetoric.
 
Maybe there is a great divide here, between poets of this stripe and others,
such as Lowell, for whom writing a "great" poem is always the object, even in
his most improvisatory mode.  Creeley, Rich, et al. don't seem to think that
great poems *can* be written, and appear unsure that one should try:  they
seem to suggest that there are more interesting fish to fry, both emotionally
and intellectually.  Or at least that notions of greatness need to be
examined afresh.
 
Well, these thoughts are all too rough, and I certainly haven't said much
about what I admire in Creeley.  But perhaps my notions here may provide some
handhold for others to grab and continue the discussion?

Cheap shot or no, the analogy doesn't work because forests are gone, sonnets
are not.  Shakespeare's on the net and no one's bombed all the libraries
yet.  No matter how the form is played with, strictly formal sonnets do &
will survive, as mummies do.  So the question seems to be not whether formal
sonnets will survive but whether they'll continue to be written.  Hacker,
Campo, etc., suggest that they will.  I am not especially convinced that it
deeply matters if they are not.  We've got a lot in & on the books.
 
Actually--Annie--I think that one way sonnets *can* survive (as a present or
future, not a past thing) is through our engagement & play with them, as in
the "Ghost" (sorry, don't have the rest of the title with me) poem.  Using
the word "sonnet" in the title, and then not writing a formal sonnet, may be
a "mockery" of/rebellion against/bending & breaking of the form--but at the
same time, making reference to a "sonnet" at all in the title attests to the
"importance" or "continual life" of the form, even if that importance is
nothing more than that the idea "sonnet" was present when the piece was
composed--that a formal sonnet, perhaps, haunts the poem (or the poet).  The
sonnet, too, as Ghost.  "Sonnet" is not yet hackneyed.  Here it continues to
in/form the poet, poem & audience.  What more could an ole' form ask?

Subject:      sonnet quiddity
 
Rob Hardin certainly wrote:
 
  A seventeenth-century sonnet can be
  analyzed in purely rhetorical terms. Such aspects of the sonnet
  might not be *as* commonly understood as its rime-scheme and meter.
  But that doesn't mean they are too obscure to be understood.
 
Lawrence J. Zillman's piece on the sonnet in the Pinkerton directory of
poetry suggests that the 'form' of the petrarcan sonnet causes a 'two-part
division of thought' to be 'invited'. Zillman elsewhere notes that Wyatt
took an immediate liking to the closing couplet, that Petrarch's
'artificiality of treatment' stemming from 'Platonic love themes' were
exported throughout Europe along with the metrical pattern and rhyme
scheme, and that in this century the sonnet has seen the gradual phasing
out of 'metronomic' iambs and exact rhymes even as the form has been
present in poems having 'almost any subject and mood.'
 
Btw, Charles, is the title 'Tone Lock' a reference to the rapper Tone-Loc?
 
By all of which I mean to suggest, Rob, that opening the encyclopedia is as
exasperating as one imagines.
 
What is at stake, Maria, I think, is the claim to centrality--not, as some
might have it, centrality of group formation based on the relative merits
of poets or poems--but of the sensibility (the sense it makes) implied by
what one assumes when writing. What is writing about. Some categories of
sensibility--idea, form, words. 'Or words.' If you control the central
sensibility, then people come to your readings, read your poems, talk about
them, etc.
 
Which they do (or do not) anyway.
 
It's not simply, Rod, that poets are deluded into thinking there's a
restricted economy. It's more like: poets are intolerant. Poetry has so
much to do with articulating what one is about--subtler more urgent
etc.--that to have to acknowledge work that contradicts one's own--it's a
kind of cognitive dissonance that hits most of the poets I know where they
fight or fly. Quine suggests a logic that can incorporate contradictions,
and he I think cites Whitman. What kind of a poet was Whitman, anyway? What
was central for Whitman, I mean. Joe Ross's 'fuzzy logic' series I've
gushed about here, too. Bob Holman's cafe gig was described by the new
yorker how? Taste brooks no contradictions, though. Apparent conflicts,
like loving both gourmet food and jello, aren't contradictions--travelling
in tastes you see everything--
 
or, Jordan, if you make a pact with yourself to ignore your basic need to
be rude to people who are making mistakes--then it may be possible for you,
individually, to read poetry (spring in) and participate in (this world of)
poetry politics (poor mutts) happily. This will to be civil may make you
crazy, but it will spare you much embarrassment when your turn comes to be
exposed for the fool you certainly are.

In-Reply-To:  <v01520d02add3c1f2a6e6@[166.84.199.56]>
 
After a desultory time as an English major, I date the beginning of
my positive experiences with poetry to the early 60's when I was
able to read Russian.  I found the early work of Yevtushenko and
Vosnesensky. This led in many directions, but I think the fascination
was related to a comment made on this list a few days ago about the
Russian poetry festival.  I deleted this (and would appreciate a copy
sent) but the general idea was that the difference between American
and Russian poetry was that American poetry was a carefully constructed
experience (whether formal or experimental) while Russian poetry began
with the experience.
 
This is consistent with my experience even if I or the poster of the
comment might not be using words that adequately describe the
difference.  I feel there is a difference and that the difference is
related to the current form discussion.  If anyone understands what
I am talking about I would appreciate hearing from them either here
or offlist.

Subject:      New Books fer Poetics
 
It was suggested to me that I periodically select 5 or 10 new books from
Bridge Street Books to offer to the list. Hopefully this will be of use for
browsers as well as shoppers, simply as a bit of "what's new." Ordering info
follows the list of books. This first list is almost entirely poetry. In the
future I will include critical books, fiction, etc. We're expecting Bob
Perelman's _Language Writing & Literary History_ soon.
 
1. _Bleeding Optimist_, Mary Burger, Xurban, $7.00. Some of you may know the
excellent magazine _Proliferation_ Burger was (is?) an editor for. "Accidents
happen here."
 
2. _Stone Marmalade_, a play by Kevin Killian & Leslie Scalapino, Singing
Horse, $9.50. "This play is our concerted attempt to demolish society."
--L.S.
 
3. _Frame Structures: Early Poems 1974-1979_, Susan Howe, New Directions,
$12.95. Reprints 4 early books
with a lengthy recent essay.
 
4. _Symmetry_, Laura Moriarty, Avec, $9.95.
"The one clear night which encompasses the subject forgets everything."
 
5. _Channel-Surfing the Apocalypse_, Susan Smith Nash, Avec, $11.95. Prose &
some drawings. Hey, a blurb by Burroghs (not quite as rare as Pynchon, but
close).
Titles include: "Knowledge is Lonely and Filled with Sticky Sap" & "My
Bulimic Jesus."
 
6. _Natural Facts_, Melanie Neilson, Potes & Poets, $11.00. Cover is a
daguerreotype, 1840s, "Still Life with Pumpkin, Shakespeare, and Sweet
Potato." Lauterbach mentions Ives in her blurb, seems right to me. "Will
Congress / Canary the canon?"
 
7. _Clean and Well Lit: Sel Poems 1987-1995_, Tom Raworth, Roof, $10.95.
Tom's tops.
 
8. _The Front Matter, Dead Souls_, Leslie Scalapino, Wesleyan, $10.95. "I'm a
scout on the quiet road into it."
 
9. _In Memory of My Theories_, Rod Smith, O Books, $9.
"No analysand can indent this largesse." Highly recommended.
 
10. just ask, we may have it.
 
We also have a limited number of signed copies of Bernstein & Joris books
from their recent significant & enlightened performance on our premises.
Charles' _Dark City_ ($11.95), _Rough Trades_ ($10.95), _The Sophist_
($11.95), _Islets/Irritations_ ($9.95), & A Poetics ($14.95). Pierre's
_Breccia: Sel Poems: '72-'86_ ($14.95), _Turbulence_ ($8), _The Irritation
Ditch_ ($4.50), & _Winnetou Old_ ($5). Also his translation of Celan's

Isn't it true that in certain periods in English lit. history, adding an
extra syllable to the line was making a statement - a flourish, something
scandalous, outrageous, flagrant.  But the english language has an extraordinar
y springiness to it, and in America it sprang all out of meter.  Here, now,
the anomalous thing is to rein in the springiness with meter.

Depends on your definition of rhyme.  Off-rhyme, conceptual rhyme, inside-
out rhyme - the english vowels are FULL of rhyme.

This attitude, paradoxically, takes form too seriously.  It's poets & poetry
from long time ago that still haunt us today (I mean literally haunt us).
I wrote a poem about Hart Crane the 3rd section of which is a sonnet
because I wanted to draw close to Crane's own memorial sonnets (to Dickinson
& Melville).  The sonnet is not a form but just a way to direct the song.

Subject:      russ/am po form
 
Tom Bell made a comment about differing Russian & American approaches to
poetic form.  Was it my post you were referring to?  I didn't exactly
say that Americans build an experience in the poem, while Russians
respond to prior experience, though that's close.  I was reflecting
both on my own take of the readings I heard at the conference and on
a remark made to me my Russian poet Elena Shvarts, to the effect that
Americans take their time through the poem getting to what they want
to say/discover, while the russians impose a kind of finality on the
poem through tight forms.  This was most evident in Ivan Zhdanov's
reading, who reads short intense almost riddle-like lyrics in a kind
of flat, resigned way - the manner playing off the intense emotional
effect.  On the other hand, a poet like Shvarts is very expansive
- but within the metrical CHANTING speech of russian poetry and
a kind of folklore-witchcraft approach to classic modes & forms
(clearly I think in the line of both Akhmatova & Tsvetaeva).
 
The end result of both approaches for me was that the american langpos
like Bruce Andrews get to a kind of dionysian explosive effect
through crazy free rant - whereas for the russians the dionysian
is definitely there but it takes on a kind of tragic finality.
Shvarts also mentioned to me how different russian poetry audiences
are - a lot of emotionality, weeping, etc. - Henry Gould

That's certainly to his credit, isn't it--
that he turned his back on the nastier
ramifications of self-promotion? I just saw
Matthew in the street, en route to his night at
Biblio's, and I must say, the man has integrity
written on his forehead.
 
Not coincidentally, when I looked *closely* at
the writing on Matt's forehead, I noticed a
certain adherence to *Shakepearean sonnet form*:
 
Integrity, integrity inte-
Grity; integrity integrity,
Integrity: integrity inte-
Grity integrity--integrity
Integrity--integrity (Inte-
Grity!) integrity integrity
Integrity integrity inte-
Grity integrity integrity.
 
Integrity integrity inte-
Grity integrity integrity?
Integrity integrity,inte-
Grity, integrity *integrity*?
 
Integrity, integrity inte;
Grity integrity, integrity.
 
(I wonder...do you think...and I mean
this, as it were, in the specu/la/tive
sense...that we might have belabored this
subject? Or is my sentiment too reminiscent
of Henry David Thoreau?)
 
Obviously, Matt is alluding to the
early magic realism of Virginia Woolf,
who said, simply, "Style is rhythm."
Or perhaps he is merely repeating the
words "mug" and "shoe" in an utterly
random sequence.
 
Nothing is more formidable than a degree in composition
(except, perhaps, a degree in zither repair).
 
Looking forward to your thoughts on the relationship between
Tourette's Syndrome and agogic accents in the couplets
of Snodgrass. Until then, I offer you an extended vacation
from my thoughts on any subject.
 
All the best,

Thst's what I mean by "survive"--continue to be written (and not only be
written--be written by engaged, original poets).  "Mummy" forms thataren't
being written haven't survived as living forms,  only as artifacts.
 
As you point out, Hacker, Campo etc. can do it, as can some of the women in
A Formal Feeling Comes, because their self-consciously marginalized
position as gays or women builds an ironic distance into the form.
 
 I am not especially convinced that it
>deeply matters if they are not.  We've got a lot in & on the books.
 
You're not convinced, but it clearly matters to some poets such as
Hacker/Campo, who get a lot of power from the form.  Personally,  I am not
all that interested in writing sonnets either right now (big surprise to
the list, huh?), but I like having many different kinds of forms around.

I agree completely.  I have no desire to prescribe, ossify, define, or
limit anyone's play with, the form or any form.  But I like being able to
speak acccurately about poetic phenomena,  and I find the technical terms
in their original meanings extremely useful.  Can't people play with the
form,  altering it more or less as they desire, without taking the
terminology along with them?  Couldn't someone say, my poem is a take on
the sonnet, rather than, my poem is a sonnet, if in fact it is not a sonnet
as much as another poem is?  It's common sense, isn't it--most educated
people would know what you meant if you said that one poem was actually a
sonnet and another was a poem that, while not really technically a sonnet,
alludes to a sonnet through such and such characteristics.
        My main interest is to increase the number and accuracy of the
terms available to us as people who want to discuss poetics.  I understand
the danger of limiting in some regressive and stifling way the play with a
form by saying that such-and-such is not a sonnet and such-and-such is.
But on the other hand, if the sonnet is so dead and pointless, then why all
the fuss about keeping its name? Why not let the poor ole dead pointless
form keep its own name so that those who choose to mess about in its
remains, for whatever perverse reasons of their own, can at least know
clearly what they are messing about in?
        Perhaps one reason this idea is so threatening to some on the list
is that the technical and critical awareness/terminology to discuss other
forms, newer forms,  is just being developed; we are just barely able to
discuss the poetics/prosody of free verse with any accuracy,  thanks to
work like Hartmann's, Boughn's, and Holder's (and perhaps my own Ghost of
Meter).  Maybe as we begin to develop resources to discuss the newer
prosodies, it will become clear that there is plenty of room for many kinds
of forms and we don't have to be fighting so hard over the stupid ole
sonnet.
 
Thanks, Emily, for your response.

     Well here I am launch'd on my 73d year--We had our birth
anniversary spree last evn'g--ab't 40 people, choice friends
mostly--12 or so women--Tennyson sent a short and sweet
letter over his own sign manual--y'r cable was rec'd & read,
lots of bits of speeches, with gems in them--we had a capital
good supper (dinner) chicken soup, salmon, roast lamb &c:
&c: &c: I had been under a horrible spel f'm 5 to 6, but warry
got me dress'd & down (like carrying down a great log)--&
trabel had all ready for me a big goblet of first-rate iced
shampagne--I suppose I swigg'd it off at once--I certainly
welcom'd them all forthwith, & at once felt if I was to go down
I would not fail without a desperate struggle--must have taken
near two bottles champagne the evn'g--so I added ("I felt to")
a few words of honor & reverence for our Emerson, Bryant,
Longfellow dead--and then for Whittier and Tennyson "the
boss of us all" living (specifying all)--not four minutes
altogether--then held out with them FOR THREE
HOURS--talking lots, lots impromptu--Dr. B[ucke] is
here--Horace T is married--fine sunny noon--

Annie Finch writes, in the current discussion of sonnet form:
 
"But I like being able to
speak acccurately about poetic phenomena,  and I find the technical terms
in their original meanings extremely useful."
 
I know this is being awfully picky of me, but isn't this sense of "original"
highly problematic? Who wrote the very first sonnet? Who first used the term
sonnet? Is either of these uses the controlling definition of the form (for
"speaking accurately" or any other purposes) Annie or anyone wants?

AD HOC SING-SONG SEA SONNET
 
I heard a tugboat huffing through the fog
while standing on a pier in gloom and guano.
I heard it straining like a hunting dog
leashed against drowning.  Far below
gray breakers, the bored sea-god, a snoring
mythological typhoon, dreamed
he floated too - sirens surrounding
his dais, sun feathering the sea-calm...
 
I thought - despite these dreary docks
and screaming gulls, that dumb sea-god and I
are one.  I dreamed his squid-like, salty locks;
he dreamed his air-filled, regal buoyancy;
and neither, throned in dry sandcastles, knows
where that turbulent, stubborn tugboat goes.

ABOUT THE BOOK (taken from its back cover):
 
Literary individualism first manifests in the twelfth century in
word puzzles and overt self-naming as well as in discussions
about the nature of writing and the role of the poet in the
world. Guillem IX, Marcabru, Dante, Chaucer, and Langland,
were poets and intellectuals. This engaging study traces their
claims of authorship, not to a need for what modernity views
as self-promotion, but rather to their interests in contemporary
philosophical debates. Yet in their creations of both history and
fiction, these poets anticipated modern narrative and its literary
persona.
 
"Kimmelman's work on the poetics of authorship is
enlightened, cogent, often exciting--a significant contribution to
our understanding of the medieval text as mediator between the
collective and the individual.  Kimmelman is nuanced,
insightful, and always aware of the resonances that involve not
only the medieval but the modern: in sum, he has given us an
alert, sensitive guidebook to the post-Classical career of ars
poetica."
- Allen Mandelbaum, Kenan Professor of Humanities, Wake
Forest University
 
"The task that Kimmelman has set himself, to locate in some of
our medieval predecessors the earliest pulse beats of what we
understand--almost take for granted--as the poetic persona,
demands a rich and deep reading not only of writers like
Guillem IX, Marcabru, Dante, Chaucer, and Langland, but
also of the shifting intellectual currents that enabled each of
them to hold up a mirror to reality that also reflected an image
of his individual self.  That he rises so well as critic, scholar,
and teacher to this challenge, results in an extraordinary
opportunity of recognition for his readers; there are moments
when Kimmelman's discussions actuate encounters of singular
connection with these historic points of poetic self-
consciousness and vitality."

i, fr one, have not misunderstood this discussion to be about prescribing what
one may or ought do; some of the arguementativeness here seems not to be about
what is *allowed*, as it does about what is *useful*... praps some have felt
that a focus on more traditional forms implies that such forms are worth
considering, to the exclusion of work that is bends or breaks those forms?
 
>...Can't people play with the
>form,  altering it more or less as they desire, without taking the
>terminology along with them?
 
my underlying assumption is that form is a social construct, rather than
an objectivly quantifiable, absolute?  (praps this puts us on different
planets, not talking th same language...)  but from that standpoint, it
makes perfect sense for a poet to "take the terminolgy" and use it as a
source of cultural meaning/context for work that, in strict prosidic
analysis, doesnt have the physical features of the traditional form.
 
i used to do a soundpoem performance called "sonnets", no words allowed
but w/ traditional rhythmic & "rhyme" schemes made using vocal & non-vocal
improvised sound events...
 
 
it's interesting to me, that this discussion has pretty consistently
refered to sonnet as typical ov formal poetry...  wd offer as contra-
example modern haiku--the old 5/7/5 stanza forms and content restrictions
have, in many contemporary "schools", largely been dispensed with.  but
distinctions are still made & hotly debated about what is or is not a
"true" haiku--"formal" distinctions being made on the basis of "content"...
dunno how that connects, if at all,w/ yr emphasis in repetition ov elements--
tho it seems that content is the repeated element? in linked forms, where
each verse is to echo/refer to th previous verse, but not to the verse
before that?

Subject:      non such sonnata forms continuum
 
     As a part of a marginalized group in the US, namely,
     a survivor of the generation which directly experienced
     the 80's crack epidemic and as a member who actually
     parlays any attention to words at all,  I quite often use
     the sonnet as a formulaic methodology of appropriating
     control for myself, as well as large words. The use of
     the sonnet as a historically masculinist propaganist tool
     for reifying the social stature and division between
     upper crust masters and indentured (poet) servants
     is aptly suitable for the modern-day low-caste survivalist
     whose sensibilities are continually extricated with
     a suburbanite martyrdom founded on television coverage
     of areas which are so ugly with possession they could not
     possibly possess a sense of community.

    Dear Annie Finch--
     I have a question in all seriousness that I would be really interested
     in your answer to. I am currently looking at alot of sonnets by poets
     who later on in their careers went on to be known for, and celebrated
     more, for their "experimental" vers libra. For instance, the early
     sonnets of Frank O'Hara, Jack Spicer, Laura Riding. Coming from the
     perspective I do, I tend to want to vindicate these early experiments
     in form (just as I am interested in Mondrian's "flowers" (etc) and
     Franz Kline's early railroad landscapes)--as important. Yet, would
     you be interested in me posting one or two of these. Because it's one
     thing for a critic like Marjorie Perloff to criticize, say, O'Hara's
     early sonnets in terms of his later work. But I am curious what
     you would say about them. I ask this in all humility. Thanks, Chris
     Stroffolino

I think I have examined this, Annie, and I also think by and large you CAN
predict what one more chant or open-form poem will be about.  If form is
adhered to too strictly it becomes a parody of itself.  This is what
insisting too authoritatively on "precise definition" produces, and it's the
danger of what you seem to be advocating.

Again, most of the time, yes, it would, except, as you say below, when it
"engages more or less dynamically and creatively with its form, whatever the
form is."  What do "dynamic" and "creative" mean?  They have to do with
energy, force, movement into the new.  How can that take place without the
TRANSformation I mentioned a couple of days ago?  If energy is trapped
within a closed room, the room blows up.

Exactly.  And I say, overterminologization does violence to the phenomenon
being engaged with.

Perhaps what you're looking for is a generally "accepted" definition, rather
than an original one. And the discussion on this list generally argues
against any such definition being too static & unchanging. Most of your
comments seem to me to argue that the tradition of the sonnet gets
considerable respect (and not undue respect) in any forthcoming definition.
It's been interesting to me that this is a live and, seemingly, rather
urgent question to people. Frankly, it hasn't been one to me. I may write a
sonnet once in a blue moon, when what I want to say seems to want to occupy
that form -- i.e. I can't remember in the last twenty or so years ever
trying from a beginning point of composition to write a sonnet, but have
found myself, in the midst of the poem, coming to that form or some
emendation/challenge of that form. But as far as arguing for the validity of
the form, or for any definition of it at all, it's just not an issue for me.
So I view this discussion with some interest & curiosity. If this turns into
a conversation about how poems find their form, be that sonnet or whatever,
I would probably be a more avid reader of the posts in this thread.
 
Good luck in your anthology. I hope you have lots of takers to edit sections
on forms, including evolving forms, experimental forms, etc.

Ah, there's a difference betweeen our poetics, I guess. In my experience,
or in my practice, the form becomes discernible when the poem is spoken,
except for, say, concrete poetry.

Dear Charles,
 
        Thanks for your thoughts for the anthology.  I hope there will be
takers, and this si the time to take, so please let me know, anyone who wants
to do a section on a form (still some nonexperimetnal ones left too--anyuone
for the ballad stanza? Charles Bernstein--didn't you say you were interested in
cowboy poetry--or perhaps anapests, since you're the only other person I know
besides myself who seems to appreciate Swinburne?) and any experimental form,
repetitive or nonrepetitive.( Women, by the way, would be especially welcome at this point.
this point--
Could one possibly imagine why?)oaically
        I completely share your goal, Charles, of bringing the deiscussion to
the point of how poems choose thier forms, sonnet or whatever they may be, and
I think the best demonstration of the sonnet's deadness, or poetry's freedom
from it, would be if your attitude of what's all the fuss about were to become
common.
        I have no idea why it's such a big deal. My hands were slapped during
my apprenticeship if I ever tried to write in form, or to write out of the
"Sentimetnal" tradition Pound quashed, so probably it's no surprise that I'm
interestd in these things now. But why is it so threatening in the arena of
this list?
        con ? Actually, I don't
care why--
 
Though I would like to make th epoint that if as Mike B. suggested to me
backchanneling, this is threattening because of a superficial similarity to neocon attacks , and . I have been surprised by the t k,saeiqkamths for the an.e
con attacks on progressive thinking about literature, that is all the more
reason to absorb carefully the germ of truth in each attitude towards poetics
in order to build a stronger and more wellrounded/balanced/impervious/flexible
body of thought about poetics.

Dear Steve,
So you cede the point taht one can predict what an open-form poem or chant will
be about, or a projective verse poem, as much as one can predict what a sonnet
will be about.
Then how can you read at all, if you find such that such predictability
precludes reading?
Do you honestly think that every "experimental" poem is in a completely new
form?  You seem to be painting yourself into a corner.

Couple decades ago I was listening to Kenner, cant remember whether it was
in the Japanese restaurant or at the lecture, when he posited that the
sonnet was accidentally created when some Italian poet, writing eight-line
stanzas, quit after doing 6 in his second stanza. Someone else found this
and mistook it for a new form, and did another, etc.
 
Kenner compared this with the post-renaissance European sculptors who found
Greek or Roman busts that were just torsi, the heads and limbs broken off,
so that they started doing it too, not breaking off liombs, but making
sculptures of torsi, and so we got that form.
