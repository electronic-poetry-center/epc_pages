_Goddesses We Ain't_ was originally a small anthology of writing by the
Tenderloin Women Writers Workshop to which my old and dear friend Mary
TallMountain belonged.  The Workshop was a miraculous thing in itself,
composed of any and all women who wanted to belong, including drug
addicts, prostitutes and older women who were in the Tenderloin because
they couldn't afford to live anywhere else.  A woman called Carol
Heller at UCB did a great dissertation on it as a grassroots educational
community.  It's great to hear they're putting out volumes!  I'm
wondering if Goddesses We Ain't Press is the one being funded by a legacy
that Mary TM left to help the homeless and creative.  I'll have to get a
copy!  Good to hear!  Gabrielle

Here's what I found out about the Henri Chopin CD:
 
It's called Les 9 Saintes-Phonies & it's released by Staalplaat in
conjunction with Korm Plastics.  I have the following addresses for
Staalplaat:
 
postbus 11453
1001 GL Amsterdam
The Netherlands
 
&
 
P O Box 83296
Oregon  97283
USA
 
 
Yes I realize that that doesn't include a city in Oregon, that's all I have.
 
The disc includes seven pieces from 1956 through the mid 1980s, with two
collaborations - one with Sten hanson & one with Larry Wendt.
 
I haven't heard the CD, but it should be available through any store that
carries "ambient/industrial" music, which is what Staalplaat mostly deals
in.  I can provide the address, phone, or e-mail for Wall of Sound in
Seattle, where I saw the disc, if anyone wants it.

Good to hear about Simon Pettet's Selected Poems, and forthcoming reading.
I read with him in Biblio's nearly a year ago - he does indeed often read
each poem twice, since most of them are very short. It's useful for slow
learners like myself, like the action replays in sports coverage. "Too
much of a good thing can be wonderful"...
 
I guess he'd change that habit, if he ever moved into long-distance work.

As the space poetry thread picks up, the new Collected Poems of Edwin
Morgan thumps (608pp) onto my desk: lots of space poems of one kind or
another, including THE FIRST MEN ON MERCURY, from over twenty years ago:
 
- We come in peace from the third planet.
Would you take us to your leader?
 
- Bawr stretter! Bawr. Bawr. Stretterhawl?
 
- This is a little plasic model
of the solar system, with working parts.
You are here and we are there and we
are now here with you, is this clear?
 
- Gawl horrop. Bawr. Abawrhannahanna!
 
- Where we come from is blue and white
with brown, you see we call the brown
here 'land', the blue is 'sea', and the white
is 'clouds' over land and sea, we live
on the surface of the brown land,
all round is sea and clouds. We are 'men'.
Men come -
 
- Glawp men! Gawrbenner menko. Menhawl?
 
- Men come in peace from the third planet
which we call 'earth'. We are earthmen.
Take us earthmen to your leader.
 
- Thmen? Thmen? Bawr. Bawrhossop.
Yuleeda tan hanna. Harrabost yuleeda.
 
- I am the yuleeda. You see my hands,
we carry no benner, we come in peace.
The spaceways are all stretterhawn.
 
- Glawn peacemen all horrobhanna tantko!
Tan come at'mstrossop. Glawp yuleeda!
 
- Atoms are peacegawl in our harraban.
Menhat worrabost from tan hannahanna.
 
- You men we know bawrhossoptant. Bawr.
We know yuleeda. Go strawg backspetter quick.
 
- We cantantabawr, tantingko backspetter now!
 
- Banghapper now! Yes, third planet back.
Yuleeda will go back blue, white, brown
nowhanna! There is no more talk.
 
- Gawl han fasthapper?
 
- No. You must go back to your planet.
Go back in peace, take what you have gained
but quickly.
 
- Stretterworra gawl, gawl...
 
- Of course, but nothing is ever the same,
now is it? You'll remember Mercury.

along the same conceptual coordinates as physicists who were at that time
busy articulating the 'conservation of energy'... never been successful in
drawing correspondences out to the satisfaction of the cultural studies

i haven't done enough with specifically economic factors (which related

i'm really plying correspondences per se, and not all that focused on the
discursive machinery of the times... which is why i was hoping to use
reynolds' new work, if only by counterexample...
 
anyway, thanx again...

It's just a phase, Ed, not necessarily a problem.  The ones who pursue
language because they're called to it will grow out of this "problem."

Ed,
 
These students are lucky to get the chance to work with you.  I have never
taught children myself, but I did work for a year in the office of
California Poets in the Schools (CPITS) where I spent lots of time xeroxing
children's poetry, plus I word-processed one year's children's poetry
anthology.  The work by these Californian children, on the whole, I found
to be horrid--geared mostly, as far as I could tell, toward eliciting from
adults an "isn't that cute response."  Occasionally an "isn't that moving
response."  There was one memorable exception, this 9 year old girl who
sounded incredibly like late John Wieners.  However, when publications from
New York's Teacher's and Writers (or whatever it's called) came through the
office, I was surprised at how much more innovative the New York children's
poems were.  To me this must be related to differences in teaching
philosophies of the two organizations.  I remember working the registration
desk at a CPITS conference while a teachers' writing workshop was going on
around me.  The point of this workshop was to examine ways the teachers
could open up their own poetry.  The exercise I remember them doing was to
write a poem that didn't have the word "I" in it.  This clearly was a new
idea to some of them.  (But look who's talking here--I use the word "I"
obsessively in my own writing, but I think it's a different sort of "I".)
 
It seemed to me that 5th graders wrote the best poems.  Earlier than that
the teachers seemed to be doing much of the writing.  Later than that the
students seemed to have learned what the teachers were trying to teach them
about writing.  The 5th graders seemed to reside in that glorious window of
creativity where they could do it on their own but didn't quite grasp what
they were "supposed" to be doing.
 
Once I had to xerox a batch of children's poems from Oakland.  Glancing
vacantly at the poems, I came across a list poem by a gradeschool girl in
which the assignment must have been to list all the things she didn't like.
It was a bana,l totally predictable list =8A I don't like it when the kids
yell at me, I don't like spinach, I don't like rain and on and on--then in
the middle of this she wrote "I don't like it when he raped me"-- and then
on with more vapidity, I don't like gym class, I don't like mustard, I
don't like it when people frown.  I just stood there and went, "Whoa!"  I
guess everything is equal in sentimental poetry.

Subject:      bk review wanted
 
I will send a review copy of a book I co-edited and published in late
1994 to anyone on this list who can meet certain criteria.  The book
is called A GLASS OF GREEN TEA - WITH HONIG (Prov.: AlephoeBooks, 1994)
distributed by Fordham Univ Press.  It's a 415pp festschrift in honor
of poet/translator Edwin Honig, with essays, memoirs, interviews,
poems, letters, artwork, & a fairly complete bibliography of Honig's
work.  Contributors include ML Rosenthal, Richard Wilbur, Michael
Harper, Rosmarie & Keith Waldrop, Yehuda Amichai, Ben Belitt, Edw.
Hoagland, Robert Bly, David Ignatow, Albert Cook, & about 65 others.
 
Here's the criteria:
- Some knowledge & interest in Honig's work; &/or in F. Pessoa & Hispanic
& Portuguese lit (Honig has translated Pessoa, Calderon, Lorca, & others).
- Ability to write a review & land publication.
 
I can afford to send out 5-10 such copies.
The book kind of fell through the cracks - maybe because it's a festschrift,
unknown press, Honig is fairly unknown quantity, maybe reasons I don't
know.  But in my humble biased opinion it deserves a review - only one
it's had so far is in college newspaper in Toronto (not to knock them,
but it didn't reach very far).  I know this is endemic to publishing
& probably everybody on this list could ask the same about a book -
I hope no one will be offended by this request.
 
If you can fill these criteria, please write & describe to:
Henry_Gould@brown.edu   Thanks - HG
 
p.s. I welcome other comments.  Am new to this list & if this is
bad list ethics or etiquette let me know (please email direct to my address.)

____________________________________________________________________
 
1. About the Poetics List
 
Please note that this is a private list and information about the list
should not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is
to keep the list to those with specific rather than general interests, and
also to keep the scale of the list small and the volume managable.
Word-of-mouth (and its electronic equivalents) seems to be working fine:
please feel free to invite people you know to sign-up. It is easier for me
if they sign-up by themselves AND send me (bernstei@ubvms) a note telling
me how they heard about the list.  I will send them *this* document in
reply.  Please contact Charles Bernstein (the listowner) if you have any
questions about this policy.
 
____________________________________________________________________
 
2. Subscriptions
 
The list has open subscriptions.  You can subscribe (sub) or
unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line message, with no subject
line, to:
 
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu
 
the one-line message should say:
 
unsub poetics
 
{or}
 
sub poetics Jill Jillway
 
(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your
name to unsub)
 
I will be sent a notice of all subscription activity.
 
____________________________________________________________________
 
3. Who's Subscribed/Getting Addresses
 
To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail message
blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:
 
  review poetics
 
This will give you current and accurate e-mail addresses for all
subscribers.  As a result, it is never necessary to post an address
inquiry for a subscriber to the whole Poetics list.
____________________________________________________________________
 
4. Digest Option
 
The Poetics List can send a large number of individual messages to
your account each day! If you would prefer to receive ONE message
each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for that
day, you can use the digest option:
 
Send this one-line message (no subject line) to
                                listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu
 
set poetics digest
 
NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply
to this message!!
 
You can switch back to individual messages by sending this messagage:
 
set poetics mail
____________________________________________________________________
 
5. When you'll be away
 
You can temporarily turn off your mail by sending a message:
 
set poetics nomail
 
& turn it on again with: set poetics mail
____________________________________________________________________
 
6. Archives of the Poetics List
 
 
There are two ways to get archives.  The easiest way is to use the
archives of the list at the Electronic Poetry Center (EPC), for which
see section 11 below. The other is described in Appendix II.
 
____________________________________________________________________
 
7. To Subscribe to RIF/T
 
To subscribe to RIF/T, the e-poetry magazine at UB's Poetics Program:
 
Send an e-mail message to listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu.  Leave
the "Subject" line of the e-mail message blank.  In the body of
your e-mail message type:
 
subscribe e-poetry John Milton
 
replacing your real name for "John Milton"
 
You will receive a confirmation of your subscription soon thereafter.
 
Note: RIF/T is also available via the Electronic Poetry
Center. Increasingly it is a richer experience to read RIF/T online
because, at the EPC, it features hypertextual links, weaving related
and disparate texts, hypertextual chapbooks, and graphical (and sound)
files that cannot be mailed in ascii form. Mailing of ascii versions
is continued through subscription; it is a good way to stay in touch
since subscribers receive Tables of Contents and other RIF/T
information, as well as some texts. Suscribers to RIF/T also receive
the occasionally-issued _EPC.News_, the Electronic Poetry Center
newsletter.
 
____________________________________________________________________
 
8. Interfaces, HTML, URL (EPC Preface)
 
Before describing the resources of the EPC and how to gain access to
it, it is useful to understand a few Internet concepts.
 
8.1 Interface
 
The Web can be access through an ascii or a graphical interface. An
ascii interface provides access through _screens_ of information with
links to other areas appearing as highlighted text; Mosaic is a
graphical interface basically superimposed on the Web structure that
offers images, sound, video, and allows you to use your mouse as a
navigational tool. The EPC is accessible through any of these
interfaces. It is presently evolving strongly towards exclusive
Web/Mosaic access.
 
Even as activities converge, it is also the time of divergent
interfaces. I am often surprised by the number of our contributors and
participants who do not even have gopher access.  Most people, we
figure, have some sort of Web access.
 
8.2 HTML
 
The standard for Web/Mosaic documents is the markup protocol called
html. These are imbedded codes that you will see once in a while when
you download an html document.  These codes give instructions to the
software about highlighting, fonts, and screen layout, as well as
providing for the _hot links_ that make possible Web/Mosaic
navigation.
 
8.3 URL
 
A URL, a "uniform resource locator," is to the Internet what a social
security number is to a person. In a web/mosaic interace, the "go to
URL" option will specify a specific and unique Internet address for
you to go to.
____________________________________________________________________
 
9. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?
 
The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is
to serve as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of
activity in formally innovative writing in the United States and the
world.  The Center provides access to numerous electronic resources in
the new poetries including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals,
the POETICS List archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic
texts, and direct connections to numerous related electronic
RESOURCES. For texts housed at the Electronic Poetry Center, texts are
"definitive" texts inasmuch as, prior to posting, they have been
approved by their producers. JOURNALS distributed by the EPC include:
 
   DIU / Albany
   EPC.News / Buffalo
   Experioddi(cyber)cist / Florence, AL
   Inter\face / Albany, NY
   Passages: A Technopoetics Journal / Albany, NY
   Poemata - Canadian Poetry Assoc. / London, Ontario (Info)/
   RIF/T: Electronic Space for New Poetry, Prose, & Poetics / Buffalo
   Segue Foundation/Roof Book News / New York
   TREE: TapRoot Electronic Edition / Lakewood, Ohio
   We Magazine / Santa Cruz
   Witz / Studio City, CA
 
The Center also provides information about contemporary print little
magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics. The Poetry
& Poetics DOCUMENT Archive provides access to a number of documents of
use to poets, teachers, and researchers. Here you will find essay
material and recent obituaries. The EPC also presently offers GALLERY,
SOUND, EXHIBITS, and an ANNOUNCEMENTS area.
 
The Electronic Poetry Center is administered by Loss Glazier and
Kenneth Sherwood in collaboration with Charles Bernstein. If you have
comments or suggestions about sites to be added to the Center, do not
hesitate to contact Loss Pequen~o Glazier, lolpoet@ acsu.buffalo.edu
or Kenneth Sherwood, e-poetry@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu
____________________________________________________________________
 
10. How to reach the EPC
 
Via the World-Wide Web, the Center can be reached at
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc (no spaces in the address)
 
Check with your system administrator if you have problems with access.
Also ask about setting a "bookmark" through your system for quick and
easy access to the Center when you invoke your interface.
____________________________________________________________________
 
11. Poetics Archives via EPC
 
Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and
year or search them for specific information. Your interface will
allow you to print or download any of these files.
 
____________________________________________________________________
 
12. Publishers & Editors Read This!
 
PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information
is open and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed
publications as easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to
participate! Send a list of your press/publications to
lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press Listing in the
subject line. You may also send materials on disk. Though files marked
up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable.
 
Send us extended information on new publications (including any back cover copy
and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists (including excerpts
from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to include full information for
ordering--including prices and addresses and phone numbers both of the press
and any distributors.
 
Initially, you might want to send short anouncements of new publications
**directly to the Poetics list** as subscribers do not always (or ever)
check the EPC; in your message please include full information for
ordering.  If you have a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention
that in any Poetics posts.

Jordan & others
 
Australian Writing On Line will start making Australian small presses and
journals available by mail and 'net' order shortly and I will send details
to POETICS. We will be new to this form of commerce (at the moment we are
distributing small presses to bookshops and selling directly at readings
and conferences) so I would be interested to hear of what short of
experience people have had buying books over the net.
 
We will have a WWW page with a catalogue and a order form ( we will also
email catalogues out). People could print out the form add their credit
card details and fax or mail (snail) back to us. We want to avoid
collecting cc details over the net.
 
By the way AWOL will have a new email address within the next few days but
people can still contact me at the Sydney Uni address.

For music there's the Compact Disc Connection -- pretty
good selection and very good prices. I access them via
telnet (199.35.15.2). There's another place that specializes
in European imports, but the prices are generally out of
my range. I beleive they're at 199.35.15.100...
 
I'd also love to find a good bookstore out here...

I've ordered CDs from Tower, but they've been very slow -- I'm still
waiting on stuff I'd ordered six weeks ago.
 
I've been ordering books via email-order through Rod Smith at Bridge
Books (aerialedge@aol.com), who, I believe, is on this list; It's
been the only wayfor me to get ahold of, for example, "In the American
Tree" and "Musicage" in the blighted wilds of Dallas.

        Sandra Gilbert has "challenged" me to demonstrate the extent to

most academic poets) participates in a poetics of the quotidian.
 
Any suggestions?

Best all around bookstore on the net is Moe's Online. Unlike the
original in Berkeley, it doesn't smell like Moe's old cigars. But
they've put up all of their catalogs and it's a broad selection. (This
is the place where Andrew Schelling worked as the poetry buyer for many
years before heading off to Naropa.) I don't know the URL, but you
could find it through Yahoo or Lycos or Alta Vista (Digital's new
64-bit web searcher) without too much difficulty.
 
I have ordered and received product from Moe's this way and it works
just fine.
 
All best,
Ron Silliman

my partner kris does a lot of these things, has _much_ better luck
beginning with the aural rather than th written...  starting out
w/ performing work (including sound poetry), then to having them
chant along with...  a favorite fr the laer is the bp nichol:
"what is the sound of a poem inside your Body Body Body Body...",
quite impressive w/ a chorus of 30 kids, improvising new bodyparts
fr the poem to be in.  final product is usually a tape on th
little 4-track, dub in mulitple voices or sound effects...
 
come to think of it, this might be a good strategy fr other age-groups...

    Dear David Carl--
    As for the "hardcore" lang. po's, it seems Silliman's recent work
   (like TONER, etc) actually has a kind of WCW feel for the quotidian.
   Of course, you should ask Gilbert in what sense she means quotidian.
   Form? Diction? Scenes? Portraits? I think Rae Armantrout and Fanny Howe
   manage it too. I'm sure there's more, but these are the first ones
   that come to mind (AND THIS IS NOT A VALUE JUDGMENT OVER WHICH L POETS
   ARE BETTER BY THE WAY)---best, cs

David Carl,
 
Challenge Sandra Gilbert to read.  I'd suggest almost anything by Ron
Silliman, Lyn Hejinian, Kit Robinson for starters.  If she's still
looking for the quotidian, keep reading:  Norman Fischer, my own
work, Larry Eigner, Charles Bernstein, etc.  Of course, she may be
asking for a particular version of the quotidian, perhaps a
reverential stare at an accepted sanctioned piece of the quotidian?
The issue may be one not so much of the quotidian itself, but the
contexts and rhetorics of its presentation in poems.....

If you consider Hejinian a "language poet," which is utterly debatable
but which an academician like Gilbert might well do, you could point to
her poem 2 from the Redo sequence:
 
Nostalgia is the elixir drained
from guilt--I've been writing
--with fingers of my non-writing hand
I patted the dashboard. "Hi car."
It responds, "Hello, Mommy."
 
The city is uncarlike. She who had lived
all her life in the city and absorbed
all its laws in her blood--madness, really
--she waited for the light
to change and stepped into the traffic
on red....
 
 
 
and so on.

Re Gilbert and the quotidian:
 
Hank's right that it depends on what questions/frames Gilbert wants to ponder
for the quotidian.  So why don't you (David Carl) encourage her to sign on and
ask for herself?
 
Charles B. has posted his syllabus for a seminar on the ordinary at the EPC,
and that might be relevant.  Rumor has it too that Marjorie Perloff has a
book-manuscript perhaps relevant too.  Is that right Marjorie?
 
I'd vote for Bernadette Mayer's Midwinter Day, Bernstein's "Emotions of Normal
People" (moving the q to discourse etc.), Scalapino's Way, and (with Chris)
Ron Silliman's Toner, with its hilarious first line ("Meet my personality")
playing on the title.  RS's Jones too.  All those people probably count as
langpo for Gilbert.  Eigner is probably closer to what she's looking for in
"quotidian."  But it's hard to guess, so as i say why not ask her to sign on
and ask?  And then maybe someday they'll be a new Norton which does a little
more than gesture at recent "experimental" writing by adding Michael Palmer
and Kamau Brathwaite (as does the new edition of the Norton Anthology of Poetry
edited by Ferguson, Salter, and Stallworthy).

poet and gets put on the spot, asked where he's "been published."  In Avec,
Conjunctions and Lingo.  "Are you part of a community of poets?"  "We
Language poets like to get together at a nice little saloon called
Gilhoolie's."  "How would you define Language poetry?" "Exactly what it
sounds like," Dart said, "Language, as much of it as possible."
 
If any of you knows Peter Straub's address please send it to me

        The Armantrout suggestion seems really promising, zeroing in on the
way she torques the little set phrases people use to talk to themselves.
 
        Two other possibilities:  1) Leslie Scalapino not only shows a
language-y way of working with the quotidian but also demonstrates something
of the breadth of what can be called langpo.  2) I would mention Robert
Creeley's enthusiastic endorsement of langpo.  I'm sure he'll testify to its
quotidian pedigree--he's said many times that what is called language poetry
is right in line with his own work's trajectory.
 
        It's also true that, faced with such a demand, one should always
wonder out loud what the heck "quotidian" is supposed to mean in our
media-soaked culture.  Is a "poetics of the quotidian" supposed to limit
itself to everyday phrases or to do something with them? --or to them?
Are we dealing with an "isn't it politically oppressive to use hard
vocabulary words" objection here?

just to take your point, dodie, about children writing poetry to satisfy/
impress (or whatever) adults--i do agree very much with that. there is
a cultivated cuteness in much of it that i've seen. and it's quite personal,
if only in that the writer is fishing for compliments (and, of course, has
been encouraged to do that). and once that problem is set, it's almost
impossible to root it out. i mainly deal with college and university
students, and generally they will argue that poetry is personal statement.
so what to do but (1) give them a poem by bruce andrews to think about or
(2) have them read foucault or some other theorist who deals with the
historical invention of the self. but none of that really works, tho
students may then write quite intricate papers about bruce andrews and
foucault or some such matter in order to satisfy/impress (or whatever)
the self who gives them their grades. i don't know what the answer is,
tho i suspect it begins with any argument about teaching poetry. the
only way to do it may be allen ginsberg's: everybody reading shelley
in unison, very loudly.

Subject:      challenges
 
Sandra Gilbert's "challenge" sounds pretty mild & really "within the fold".
If you want to read a real heavy challenge, see Mutlu Konuk Blasing's
new book, Politics of Form in Postmodern Poetry (Cambridge).  It's
brilliant in the tendentious blunt-instrument way of criticism (in
which taxonomies often end up being unfair to individual poets).
 
Blasing argues that Language poetry is "late modernism"; that it
repeats the assumption that radical politics = political realism =
avant-garde technique, based on the Pound/Olson schema that
rhetoric (Pound's Victorianism, Olson's "magazine poetry") can
be opposed by anti-rhetorical technique which unveils Nature/
the Real/the True (name your ideal).  This "progressive", heroic
anti-rhetorical technique IS the rhetoric of the avant-garde, but
the fact of rhetorical motivation is suppressed.
 
Blasing claims that "true" postmodernism (as opposed to say "magazine"
postmodernism as defined by the Norton anthology), as represented
by her examples Ashbery, E. Bishop, Frank O'Hara, Merrill, shows
a clean break with these Poundian modernist assumptions.  Her
postmodernists foreground their own rhetorical moves, and claim
no political or metaphysical efficacy for their art (here she
critiques the New Formalists on the same grounds); these poets
also reject a "progressive" reading of literary history, in which
"old" forms or techniques are inherently anachronistic and
reactionary.  Her description of the aesthetics of poetry - as
a kind of surplus of meaning, reads however like a good description
of language poetry.  Also I think she reads Olson kind of
tendentiously (sticking to his manifestos rather than his
poetry as a whole).  Nevertheless, this is a very powerful
and perspicacious marshalling of arguments - I predict it will lead
to some re-thinking about 21st century poetry.

I have heard good things (as I said re: some records, a few days ago),
about the CD web site at http://www.cdnow.com -- which seems to have
about every CD in print, import and domestic, at reasonable prices.
 
For books, a similar service exists at http://www.amazon.com, which also
seems to have about every book in print (not too many from exquisitely
small presses however), as well as a pretty good list of volumes
forthcoming, and some pretty neat profiling/emailing service features.
Haven't tried that one either.

It was a great and unanticipated relief for me to find Silliman's poetry
written on a bus about riding a bus. Hannah Weiner is the only "mystical"
poet I know of whose spirit voices tell her to sit up straight, stop being
such a loser, etc.
 
In fact, if we define "language poetry" as the poets I found starting with
_In the American Tree_, I'd say that the first big rush for me was
precisely that all the writers, no matter what their differences, had found
ways to avoid that horrible "I am a sensitive artist looking for sensitive
situations" tone we're all so familiar with from mainstream poetries, thus
allowing a little real life to creep back in. Or rather a wide range of
real lives.

Folks,
 
A genuinely interesting and engaging radio program
is coming to the otherwise mediocre world of American
public broadcasting.
 
The program "LINEbreak" begins national distribution
in April and features in-depth conversation and extended
performance by some of the most interesting writers at
work today.  LINEbreak guests include:
 
Barbara Guest           Fiona Templeton
Cecilia Vicuna          Peter Straub
Jackson Mac Low         Robert Creeley
Madeline Gins           Ted Pearson
Hannah Weiner           Karen MacCormack
Steve McCaffery         Carla Harryman
Ben Yarmolinsky         Bruce Andrews
Paul Auster             Ben Friedlander
Jena Osman              Dennis Tedlock
Ray Federman            Ken Sherwood
Loss Glazier            (and others)
 
LINEbreak is a weekly half-hour typically featuring
one artist per program in conversation and performance
with interviewer and co-producer Charles Bernstein.
 
LINEbreak is unlike *anything* else on the radio.  It
offers a broad space for artists to perform and a forum
for detailed discussion in an otherwise under-utilized
medium.  It is good radio.
 
Please call or write the Program Director at your
public radio station and tell her or him:
 
* You want to hear more arts programming like LINEbreak
  when it airs in April.
 
* LINEbreak would be a valuable service to their
  arts/university/college audience (their most faithful
  constituency).
 
* It's completely free!
 
* To look for our ad in _Current_ and can contact me
  for more information:

What about James Schuyler's works, particularly FREELY ESPOUSING, and

quotidian.

   I'm not sure why people have the idea LangPo doesn't deal with the
"quotidian."
It seems to me that it admits a wider range of daily experience than the
"normal" (whatever that is) lyric poem.  Remember Silliman's anthology, In
The American Tree, was subtitled Language/ Realism/Poetry.  That word
"realism" can mean (among other things) something similar to this
"quotidian."

Have been reading a lot of Borges lately, namely, THE BOOK OF SAND. Now,
I've been trying to figure out what his work means to me and what it
might mean to others? That is, should I classify it as philosophically
introspective, or just sci-fi? Or perhaps just purely representative of
Poe-esque, or O. Henry-esque tales, or
all of the above? I imagine that one of his main influences was Poe, was
it not? I don't really know what to do with his work. It seems like so
many things at once, I don't know how to entangle it all to find out what
it's trying to do. Is it just trying to imitate the gruesome and the
fantastic, or does it want to make some Orwellian type statement, or
perhaps some existential statement. Borges, himself said he wrote to pass
the time, but of course modern criticism does not rely on, or trust the
writer's motives as trustworthy devices for interpreting. Any help would
be apprecitated. NICOLE HOELLE

Just to jump in quickly on this as it is the sort of thing that I find
particulary disheartening: Bernadette Mayer was included in such 70s and
early 80s assemblings of poetry and poetics as L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, In The
American Tree, This, etc.; her work has always been very important to me
(I've written about it and often teach it) and I know that is true for
many others who also published in these places.  At the same time,
Bernadette has publically expressed reservations about the approach to
poetry and poetics often associated with these contexts. If this makes it
difficult to "label" her, that's all for the good.  But I do take
exception to this (gossip assumed as fact no sooner than it's uttered):

Chris--
 
I wouldn't call Mayer a language poet either--the point was that Gilbert
(probably) would, which (if I'm right) says something.
 
Haven't heard any stories of "exclusion"--she's in Ron S's anthology.  BM does
say a thing or two about language poetry/poets in that _lingo_ interview.
I'll dig it out and quote if i must but would rather not.

And for that matter why not "neurochromantic," since (a) it's in the
ballbark neologically and (b) it sounds quite possibly even more cool
and, more than that, offers up a slew of what I guess we should call
"interpretations" or perhaps glosses and finally (c) a few people will
simply have no fuckin idea what it could be referring to and a dash of
elitism, while hardly useful and by no means productive, is still bound
to make language use more interesting--or make the debate about it so.
 
With neurochromantic fondness, then,

I went to a little talk the other day at which Marjorie chatted about
some of this stuff, with reference to what I think must be the intro. of
the MS in question, which makes the book look worth reading--it's about
Wittgenstein and stuff, subTI "...the Strangeness of the Ordinary", but
of course she'll tell more and better.
Anyway I'm wondering (and she probably goes into this, or could) whether
perhaps the term "poetics of the quotidian" could be narrowed to
_language_ of the quotidian, and whether that might generate some better
discussion; when we ask ?'s w/such enormous terms as "poetics" we know
we're heade to murky territory in the first place, and in the second
place we're really not saying much anyway.  Enough about themes, etc.!
What's distinct, not about some Mode of L poetry, but about its uses and
abuses of its own materiality?
 
Hoipe this has been suitably time-consuming for all,  Ryan

Well, it seems like a lot of people who get ideas like this have been
reading too much theory and not enough of the poetry.  I'd even go out on a
limb and say that if one were to approach the poetry without reading
anything specifically identifiable as "criticism" (though of course these
categories come increasingly to collapse), and then ask oneself this
question about the quotidian, one might just come to the conclusion that a
goodly portion of LangPo is dedicated to taking elements of experience not
traditionally thought of as "quotidian" and making them PART of the everyday
by relentlessly calling our attention to them.  Which is not to conjecture
whether this endeavor succeeds or fails--that's up to the individual reader
and hir experience coming onto the field.
 
And that's my gross generalization for the day. Submitted for responses from
the fiberoptic floor. :-)

   Dear Charles--
   Thanks for the clarification. I should not have made so hasty generalization
   (though it WAS in the form of a question; and there ARE different levels
    of exclusion--but I guess there's no point getting into that)....
   But the main point I was trying to make in this discussion was a trend
   *I* consider disheartening---that is the co-optation of PRE-LANGUAGE
   poets under that banner, and I am NOT blaming any single person Charles
   for this--but am trying to cut a bandwagon off at the pass before people
   like Gilbert start seeing O'Hara, Spicer, Ashbery, Schuyler, etc. AS
   LANGUAGE poets....as if any of this MATTERS. love and love, chris stroffolino

A question for Henry Gould about Mutlu Blasing's book.  I think an early
version of one of these chapters appeared some years ago in _American Literary
History_, an essay on Merrill which used Michael Palmer as a strawman.
What I found interesting about that essay was the degree to which its arguments
depended not upon a reading of Palmer's poetry but rather on a parsing of some
remarks made in an interview (which I happen to have conducted).  So my
question:  to what extent does Blasing actually attempt to READ the poetry
she is calling "late modernism" and to what extent do her claims depend upon
prose written by language poets?  (Some of this prose announces itself as
"misleading").  The question emerges(in part) after your account of her reading
of Olson.
 
Just curious.  Since books are expensive, I want to know if I should hurry out
and spend the money to see what the 21st century will look like.  I'm also
wondering if she's tried to name the inheritors of the "real" after-modernism
(avoiding that p-word), those carrying on for Bishop and Merrill?
 
Lots of questions, but those are the first two.  I was also fascinated by
the argument as it appeared in ALH (had a title like James Merrill , Postmod-
ernist, or some such) and remember thinking that, well, if the term's that
important to her, she can have it).  But I AM interested in hearing more of
the book.  Why this need to name THE postmodern, to wrestle it away from
so-called imposters?  Why this need to name THE future?  How does she avoid
becoming tangled in the very tactics she attributes to so-called "late-modern"
Olson/lp/etc.?

Certain classes have internalised the printed word.  Written language no
longer has to echo the spoken.  The spelling of the English language shows this.
 
Does anyone know examples of poetry which is fine to the eyes but is not for

This must be possible without resorting to any visual effects beyond the
ordinary typeface, with ordinary spacing.

Blasing's book is a challenge but believe she tips her hand in her choice of
subjects. O'Hara, Bishop, Ashbery, & Merrill. Par for the quotidian, ey? Hank
Lazer's recent reading of Charles B. relative to Ashbery in APR seems strong
response to Blasing's frame. Also Rasula's _American Poetry Wax Museum_ seems
truly useful historicizing relative to Blasing. In this context open as
opposed to closed form takes on wider connotation, i.e. institutional
connotation. There's no questioning the rhetorical complexity of the poets
Blasing is pushing but the same complexity is to be found in Brathwaite, or
Berrigan, or Hejinian, Spicer!, or, or, or, when it is read for. At the (big)
risk of oversimplifying, it reminds me of a criticism leveled at Derrida--
deconstruction of the Western Canon, yes, but that's still placing attention
on the Western Canon. Or, more concisely, deconstruction as nostalgia for the
canon. So, in many ways Blasing is right (pun intended), but in the ways that
matter to me as a writer, reader, & publisher, way wrong.
 
Another note, on Rasula's book, which I second many in *highly* recommending.
I was struck by the absence of the New York School as a force. Black Mountain
gets 8 citings, l.p. 12 (or more), S.F. Renaissance gets 2, "New York School"
as a phrase appears only once. Ashbery & O'Hara get discussed here
& there, though in the counting citations game Clayton Eshleman receives as
many as O'Hara (seven). Mayer gets two cites, Notley one, Berrigan one.
Duncan, cujillion. All of which to say a chapter's missing from the book
which would read the Padgett/Shapiro anthology, maybe the World anthology,
possibly talk about the Hoover's genesis in _Oink_, etc. And address the
question whether there is was will be an "Age of Ashbery." Though his poem in
_Can You Hear, Bird_, "Today's Academicians" answers that better'n inybotty.

The relationship between Langpo and Bernadette Mayer's work is, as
Charles B and Chris S both note, very much there.  As I dredge into my
memory of what happened, at least as perceived in NYC when
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E first appeared, langpo appeared as a reaction or response
to the vulgar zen/"no-nothing bohemianism" of second/third/4th gen ny
school then predominant downtown.  Bernadette was/had been a visible
exception to an apparent anti-intellectualism.  But her writing was also
very much a part of and accessible within that other tradition, which
could be part of why she might want to draw distinctions between her work
and langpo. Alice Notley might be another example.
 
But why should Sandra Gilbert distinguish between Bruce Andrews and John
Ashbery (esp. THE TENNIS COURT OATH).  Isn't the writing equally
programmatic (or not)?  Or, between Bob Grenier and Larry Fagin?  I don't
think of langpo as a movement like surrealism where individuals are
constantly being thrown out and readmitted after self-criticism.  Its
more a way of categorizing or approaching a range of writing that loosely
shares some general principles/points of view.
 
Tho I admit my standing for adjudicating these questions might be less
than authoritative.

Subject:      Re: challenges: Keith Tuma
 
Keith:  thanks to your response to my Blasing blitz.  It's very late at night
but I'll mumble a few things, save your post, & maybe say something more
sensible another time.
 
First off: Politics of Postmodernism, by M.K.Blasing, Cambridge UP, is $56.
The only reason I have access to it is that I work in a college library.
So if you're thinking of buying it, well, that's the price.  Maybe check the
library first (or ask them to order).
 
Does the author actually read Olson, Language poets?  The "close readings"
are only of the 4 authors I mentioned (Ashbery, O'Hara, Bishop, Merrill).
As a critic, she's taking the long historical view; but part of her argument
is that American poetry, from at least Whitman, has ALWAYS conflated
technique with politics.  And when "Poundian" modernists combine this
with the rhetorical equation "anti-rhetoric = truth/nature/reality"
they are assuming certain things about poetry which "her" postmodernists
cannot assume without question.  She quotes Merrill from an interview
saying that the poets he admires "write like angels; Pound tries to write
like a god."  I.e., Pound believes his writing purifies rhetoric out and
transcribes the real; the postmodernists, on the other hand, are skeptics
writing with an awareness of the inherent persuasion - that every speech
act is both indeterminate and politically implicated - in poetry.
Rhetoric is both unavoidable, and is a link with the communal means
of making poetry which have always been available.
 
I'm sorry to just rehash what I wrote before; haven't quite addressed
what you raised.  My "book review" was a precis, not an endorsement;
I think this whole hashing out of historico-critical judgement is
integral & necessary - it's how succeeding generations encounter what's
been done - but it's the poets, not the critics, who provide the
real synthesis/appreciation of what's been done.  Critical generalizations
are always subject to refinement & debunking.  For example, Blasing
has no room to address the mediating role of "painterliness" - ut
pictura, and all that - insinuating between so-called New York poets
and language poets.  Abstract expressionism is extremely CONCRETE -
it's just the paint on paper, the way Zukofsky is just the words -
and this has affected the artistic goals of "experimental poets" in
ways which have little to do with Blasing's characterization of
"heroic modernism".
 
In spite of this, I think Blasing has clarified a lot of the political
issues in US poetry, raised some good questions, maybe enabled the
junking of a lot of attitudes that have been around too long.  I
think the ponts people have raised about the refreshing "unpoetic"
feel of language poetry, its new tone, are very true.  I also think
a lot of it is just as self-indulgent and arbitrary as the most
"subjective free verse" of the 70s was.  I shouldn't even say
anything cause I've read so little of it.  I find most of it too
vague, undirected, hard to read.  It's all mannerism, all surface,
no meaning, no pith.  Sorry.  Go read a poem.
 
Ultimately - now that I'm really blathering - I think Blasing and LP
represent 2 poles of postmodernism, and I don't really buy into either.
It's all based on deconstruction, which I don't accept either, though
its refinements are fascinating.  Why don't I accept it?  Basically,
because i think that synthesis, unity, and identity are just as
integral to reality - and just as remote from human comprehension -
as are deconstruction's difference, division and undecideability.

"Higgins, 59, revealed last week that his health has deteriorated to the

The operation would be performed at UCLA Medical Center.  Higgins and his
wife, Gina, are planning to raise the money needed for the procedure and
post-op care."
 
In addition to Higgins's remarkable work as a musician, he launched the
World Stage performance space and record label based in Leimert Park.
Last year his wife opened the California Coffee House in Culver City.
Neither of these will produce enough income for the operation.

More seriously, though -- and even though I think you could quote
almost any passage from the work of a dozen or so folks and demonstrate
that point (Watten's Progress, any of my writing, My Life by Hejinian,
anything by Bruce Andrews, anything by Hannah Weiner, anything by
Charles Bernstein, etc.) -- I'm not sure that a "poetics of the
quotidian" is a value as such. Rather, the question might be better
posed of what do people do with daily life in their poetry? What does
their work expose, treat, extend?

Chris,
 
You are hallucinating. Never in my life have I ever heard anybody who
has been described as a language poet "exclude" Bernadette. Please look
on page 410 of In the American Tree (and for the next 14 pages) and her
theoretical writing in the "Second Front" section of the anthology (p.
557), which comes immediately before my own. And I think that the
experience of _Tree_ is typical.
 
While Bernadette has always been closely personally and aesthetically
to the NY School, so have Greenwald and Coolidge. And similarly,
Grenier and Bromige come straight out of the Black Mountain aesthetic.
But so what?
 
What is this distinction that needs to be maintained? By whom?

I haven't read the book but I'm not sure that I don't agree with
Blasing that langpo carries forward many of the fundamental impulses
that underly modernism. In the same general sense that Habermas talks
of "modernity" as an incomplete project (tho "completeness," Habermas'
term, seems peculiarly teleological a category).
 
Much of what makes the postmodern discourse so incoherent is that it
presumes (as apparently does Blasing's book, at least from Henry's
posted synopsis) a stable definition of modernism that one might be
"post"...and no such definition exists or (I would argue) is even
possible.
 
In literature, the dominant discourse around that term extends out of
the new critics' appropriation of Clement Greenberg and is full of
misreadings, a justification of an aesthetic that would take us from
Joyce to Robert Lowell.
 
That list of pomo writers (Blasing's category) is equally silly. I've
seen several attempts by people to invoke premodernists and/or
antimodernists as a form of pomo (I've heard some of gnu formalists use
it thusly).
 
What argle-bargle this all is.

Dear Chris,
 
Greenberg's contribution to a PARTISAN REVIEW symposium on the
State of American Writing, 1948, might interest you, not only
for the distance CG takes from the "new" criticism, which "has
illuminated much but...also darkened much, shutting out both
light and air" and in which stirs "the breath of provincial-
ism, not to say academicism" (256), but also for his interesting
characterization of the avant-garde project.  His contribution
begins:
 
"It seems to me that the most pervasive event in American letters
over the last ten years is the stablization of the avant-garde,
accompanied by its growing acceptance by offical and commercial
culture.  It has modified that culture to a limited extent and
has in return been granted a recognition and place that do not
dissatisfy it.  The avant-garde has been professionalized, so
to speak, organized into a field for careers; it is no longer
the adventure beyond ratified norms, the refusal in the name of
truth and excellence to abide by the categories of worldly success
and failure.  The avant-garde writer _gets ahead_ now, and inside
established channels: he obtains university or publishing or
magazine jobs, finds it relatively easy to be published himself,
is asked to lecture, participate in round tables, etc., writes
introductions to the classics, and can even win the status of a
public figure.
        There is nothing inherently wrong with this (after all,
who is best fitted to write introductions to the classics? and
why shouldn't serious writers be rewarded with material security?),
but so far this accomodation has produced liabilities that
outweight the assets."

In-Reply-To:  <199602030507.AAA27796@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu>
 
Ryan Johnson and Keith Tuma referred to my work on the quotidian--in my
new book (out in a few months) called WITTGENSTEIN'S LADDER: POETIC
LANGUAGE AND THE STRANGENESS OF THE ORDINARY--I take up precisely this
question.  I would argue, contra Gilbert etc. that "language poetry" is
one of the sites where the ordinary (I don't like the word quotidian much
because it's not quotidian enough and makes me think of Wallace Stevens's
"The Malady of the Quotidian"), is most sharply foregrounded.  Robert
Creeley, as I argue in the book, does extraordinary things with the most
ordinary and everyday of words and phrases and so do Rosmarie Waldrop,
Ron Silliman, Rae Armantrout, Charles Bernstein, etc etc.
 
One of the most important distinctions, I think, is between those poets
who really try to understand ordinary language as it's actually used by
all of us, and neo-confessionals like Gilbert is that if you look at,
say, a Philip Levine poem closely--one of those poems that purports to be
"real honest," "man-to-man," "no punches pulled," you'll see that the
language in fact is not the least bit "ordinary"--that is, people don't
say the things he has them saying--but is a kind of simulated candor that
I find terribly irritating.
 
I'm at this moment teaching for the first time in years Frank O'Hara and
what makes him so delightful and amazing (and so unlike a Levine) is that
he's willing really to say in a poem what he might say in actual
conversation even as he steps back and laughs at himself.  His work is
much closer to language poetry than had been thought: witness Ben
Friedlander's recent PhD dissertation for Buffalo, "jetting I commit the
immortal spark," 69 parts of an essay on Frank O'Hara (a set of poetic
meditations).  I think a key question in this debate is to look at actual
lines of poetry and ask yourself the Wittgensteinian question, "Under
what circumstances and in what context, would someone actually say
this?"  Try it out on the typical Norton anthol. poem and you'll see how
fakey it really is, how much self-censorship goes on.
 
And speaking of Norton, I just got the ad for the new 4th edition of the
Norton Anthology of Poetry and was dismayed.  It is even worse than the
3d.  Now that Norton has done its "bit" but publishing Hoover's PoMo
anthology, they evidently think they can go back to business as usual.
This new Norton is enough to make anyone want to forget all about poetry,
at least postWorld War II American poetry.  Lots of Anthony Hecht and Amy
Clampitt.....

Just to let you know a new set of links has been added to the Electronic
Poetry Center. It's called:
 
EPC Connects: Literary Archives
 
This links to some pretty incredible lists of manuscript and other material
by poets that many here would find interesting. These are finding aids but
they read better than most books in your average bookstore!
 
Right now I've linked to:
 
--SUNY Buffalo Poetry Collection
--UCSD Literary Archives
--University of Connecticut--Storrs
 
So do have a look! Also, if you know of other similar collections with
similarly extensive online guides, let me know via a personal e-mail message.
 
My congratulations to the folks at these institutions who have made these
collection descriptions available!

In the last few days I've received several messages
that abbreviated Postmodern "pomo" or "PoMo."  In
respect to the California Native Americans whose
heritage is Pomo, I'm wondering if we could find a
substitute abbreviation.
 
For some fine work by writers of Pomo heritage, see
any of Greg Sarris's recent books and Kathleen Rose
Smith's work in _The Sound of Rattles and Clappers:

(Arizona, 1994).

well i s'pose this is ancillary to henry's initial post re blasing's book,
which just in terms of the poets she's lumping together seems to me driven
by the same old same old sorts of literary theoretical issues... anyway, as
to the postmodern, and at the risk of appearing pedantic as hell, check out
the 'definition' offered in the johns hopkins guide to literary theory...
really, no bullshit here---it's really a nice summary of how the term has
been used, what it currently signifies...
 
anyway, it seems clear to me from henry's summary that, whatever its value
(and to risk responding hastily given that i haven't read it), blasing's
book is operating along tried & (un)true institutional coordinates... that
is, we take such & such poets, we 'read' them against various claims to
political efficacy (some made by the poets themselves, some not), and we
determine which poets have played the fool to historical realities
(modernist, pomo, etc.), which rhetorics, not to say poetics, are the more
successful in surfacing aesthetic-political tensions and 'deploying'
rhetorical antidotes of one sort or another, as identified by the poetry
critic as most pressing (pressing wrt their day? to today?)... which
amounts to a way of measuring and judging aesthetic practice in terms of a
presumed political imperative to which we have unmediated access thanks to
one of various critical methodologies...
 
this is just too easy, finally... i hate to play the gadfly, but i'm forced
to ask whether in fact blasing is willing to apply such
rhetorical-aesthetic-political analysis to her own effort, her own text?...
where is the corresponding critique of critical practice that has 'given
us' such poets in such terms in the first place, that has so placed poets
at the hands of critical practice, critical judgment?...
 
it could be argued that what we need are different ways of reading various
poetries---historically, politically, aesthetically, etc... that at least
some of these ways of reading would entail different ways of writing and
rewriting critical practice, of situating critical practice... and that no
way of reading is immune from its own institutional
moorings/maneuverings---which, irony of ironies, i take (at this point,
anyway) to be blasing's point wrt any but her OWN practice...
 
mebbe i should go out and read the damned thing, but even thinking about it
makes me cranky... or is it the minus 6 deg. high here in the windy

I suppose it's debatable whether these are "not for the ears" but they do have

eyes" but the visual specificity or "fineness" they provoke, because of their
insistence on formula, can also collapse into the opposite impression.

Do you mean "not fine for the ears" or "not for the ears at all"?  If the
latter, I don't go along with your premise.  The ear is always just as
involved in language as the eye is.  Only the proportions shift--i.e., some
poems appeal more to the "outer" eye and the "inner" ear, some to the
"mind's" eye and the "real" ear.  But a glance through Kostelanetz'
anthology _Text-Sound Texts_ will show that a sound poem (one that
ostensibly exists only as sound) can indeed be effectively presented as--a
visual or concrete poem (one that ostensibly only exists as visual sign).
These are just two poles of the same magnet.  Without *both* poles, you'd
have no magnet and *no* poles.
 
E.E. Cummings' grasshopper poem has been cited as being a poem that cannot
be spoken, but in my experience reading it, the ear does struggle to
pronounce the words with their jumbled-up letters.
 
Written language may no longer have to echo the spoken, but that doesn't
mean there's no connection at all between them.
 
Of course, some poems seem to present themselves more engagingly in media in
which sound is foregrounded, while others seem to do so in media which
foreground sight.  But I wonder if this phenomenon isn't terribly subjective
and individual.
 
Can anyone think onf any other examples we could talk about?

Greenberg is a writer whose work needs always to be contextualized,
since its stance shifted steadily throughout his career. When he wrote
"Art and Kitsch" in 1939, the essay that did more than any other to
popularize a conception of aesthetic modernism (tho it never uses that
term), it was part of a consciously Trotskyist intervention: in
recognizing the Nazi's sentimentalization of aesthetics, he saw its
spread throughout western culture--which today we might recognize
really as the spread of a popular culture driven by capital--as a sign
of protofascism everywhere. (This theme is repeated, this time as
farce, regularly by the critics of the New Criterion, who instead see
pop culture as evidence of the mongrelization of west civ by all of us
unwashed types who got through college on foodstamps.) Part of what
made Greenberg's coining of that term so successful was its adoption by
the New Critical professors.
 
Although he never became the full-bore neocon that many 1930s trots did
by the 1950s and 60s, Greenberg did move steadily to the right. His
essays typically appeared in Partisan Review, although they also
appeared in other publications that made the same rightward shift over
time, such as Commentary. Partisan is a particularly interesting case
in that it was not an academic journal in the same sense as Kenyon,
Southern or Sewanee reviews. Remember that the New Critics grew out of
the agrarian movement of the Fugitives, and had already settled into a
politically conservative mode. Alan Golding details (as have many other
commentators) the long march to the right of PR as well as noting its
impact culturally: it had 6,000 readers in 1946, 10,000 in 1950. Even
in its earliest days, PR championed the high art of Eliot (which is to
say, a particular high art) and, to quote Golding verbatim, "Beyond
Berryman..., poets who can fairly be associated with _Partisan_ in the
years 1946-55 Shapiro, Wilbur, Bishop, Roethke, Snodgrass, and
Hoffman--none of whom would be out of place in the more overly New
Critical Journals." These are precisely the "professional"
avant-gardists that Greenberg seems to be referring to in the 1948
quote Steve Evans posted earlier. [I can't praise Golding's book too
highly on this subject, by the way--the chapter on the NC is by far the
best short history of the institutional politics of New Criticism we
have ever had.]
 
Consider Greenberg's essays in _Art and Culture_. His key selection of
pieces, it begins with "Art and Kitsch" and ends with four essays on
writing, two of them concerning the poets Eliot and Brecht. The piece
on Eliot was originally written in 1950, relatively late (and at a
point when the NC seizure of English Departments was nearly at its
height). In the piece on Eliot, ostensibly a review of the Selected
Essays, Greenberg contrasts Eliot and Pound as critics in these terms:
 
    but if Eliot alone fulfilled himself as a critic, it was
    because his sense of relevance was infinitely more constant,
    more "scientific."
 
Similarly, a page later, Helen Gardner's book on Eliot is described
thusly:
 
    Miss Gardner reads closely and well, and with one
    notable exception, extracts no more from what she
    reads than she can vouch for in her _experience_
    of what she reads.
 
Such passages are little anthologies of NC buzzwords. That Greenberg
(who here is attacking the slackness of the Four Quartests, one point
on which he and I do agree) is not simply couching a provocative
argument in a honey-coated language for a particular audience (sort of
a Charles Bernstein avant la lettre) can be deduced from this passage
on the very next page.
 
    Perhaps the deepest source of Eliot's recent failures was
    already to be detected in his earlier, and earliest,
    successes. His montage sequences, with their abrupt shifts
    of focus, are important gains for the art of verse [Greenberg
    here obviously does not know, as we now do, that these were
    Pound's contribution], but they also compensate for an
    inability to advance an action or a feeling through what
    I would call incremental transitions. This is not an
    inability peculiar to Eliot among the leaders of modernism
    in his generation. Yeats does not suffer from it, but writers
    like Pound, Wyndham Lewis and William Carlos Williams do--
    and do so almost pathologically. Whether in verse or prose,
    Pound proceeds--if he proceeds at all--by fits and starts;
    the increasing reliance of his verse on present-participular
    constructions betrays what is really a kind of inertia of
    imagination; his best original poetry, like his best criticism,
    has never been sustained enough to amount to more than passages.
    Nor can Williams, who seems equally incapable of traveling with
    consecutiveness in a fixed direction, claim more than a few
    completely fulfilled poems.
 
It goes on like this for a few more pages. This is shrill stuff. Right
up there with anything that was ever done to the langpo writers.
Greenberg's essay closes with a classically New Critical flourish:
 
    The so-called obscurity of modernist literature has, of course,
    a lot to do with the new stress on exegisis.... (S)uccessful
    art can be depended upon to explain itself....
 
He ends by wishing that Eliot the poet listened more to Eliot the
critic. In all, a totally political piece of writing: attempting first
to separate out Eliot from imprisoned fascist Pound and the
marginalized Williams, then to separate out Eliot the critic from Eliot
the poet (while still trying to maintain credibility by admitting that
the Four Quartets are basically snoozers.)
 
(The Brecht piece, published in 1944, is also worth reading, since
Brecht after all totally violates the terms set forward in "Art and
Kitsch" and Greenberg likes Brecht, or at least the pre-Communist
Party Brecht. He explains this by identifying BB as a parodist, which
means that his use of low culture is a means of turning fascism against
itself. You gotta love the circularity.)
 
In his essays "'American-Type' Painting," the 1955 classic that
declares abstract expressionism triumphant over all other forms of
painting, and painting triumphant over all other forms of modernist
art, Greenberg follows yet another standard New Critical move in his
discussion of Whitman, used here to put Clyfford Still in his place:
 
    Still's uncompromising art has its own kind of affinity
    with popular or bad taste. It is the first body of
    painting I know that asks to be called Whitmanesque in
    the worst as well as the best sense, indulging as it does
    in loose and sweeping gestures, and defying certain
    conventions (like light and dark) in the same _gauche_
    way that Whitman defied meter. And just as Whitman's
    verse assimilated to itself quantities of stale journalistic
    and oratorical prose, Still's painting....
 
Elsewhere in the book, Greenberg uses terms like "monotonous" and
"antiaesthetic" to describe the work of Pound, Stein and Joyce. In
short, Greenberg used the NCs just as they used him and if the
political gap between them in the late 1930s was great, by 1950 it was
hardly noticeable. That Williams bashing above, by the way, does not
even warrant a mention of WCW in the book's index.
 
Today, almost half a century later, Greenberg seems to be an instance
of the same sort of schizophrenia we see in a mag like The Nation
(another of his main venues), the closest thing we have to an official
paper of record for the American left with openly reactionary literary
aesthetics.
 
Rather than responding as some of the marxian critics have by reading
Greenberg as a mechanism in "how NYC stole modern art," it would be far
more interesting to ask ourselves what abstract expressionism would be
if it had not had his contextualizing framework from day one. I suspect
that it would look very different.
 
By the way, Chris, I do hope that your spelling of the verb in "I break
for hallucinations" was intentional.
 
All best,

People shouldn't be dissuaded from reading the Blasing bk on the basis of the 4
 poets she covers.  Some people seem to have some kind of ESP: simply list some
 names and they will get the gist of the book right away and come up with a
much longer list of writers who should have been included.  I've probably
misread & misrepresented the thing anyway.  Her 4 poets are not a "canon";
her bk is not a "magisterial" historical survey; she has a very specific
argument to make, and it's not a simple anti-langpo diatribe, she critiques
"New Formalism" on the same lines.  Suffer with me while I try to restate
what I see as this argument very briefly: Pound, and Olson after him in
particular, have had a very strong influence on post-WWII American poetry;
it's an approach to making poetry which carries certain assumptions about
art which havebecome rote - blinders - for succeeding generations of poets.
Some poets, on the other hand, resist, qualify, or ironize these assumptions,
and these poets (using 4 as examples, not exemplars or icons) can properly
be called postmoderns.  What are these assumptions?  That technical
innovation is inherently politically progressive/correct (i.e. free verse
is liberating - an early example); that there are techniques which
blow away the conventional mists of rhetoric & reveal truth (i.e.
the Chinese ideogram, or Olson's "process").
Blasing's postmodernists resist the simple identification of style &
politics, technique and artistic progress; and she cites specific
statements made by each of them, in essays or interviews, which support
the idea that there was some conscious differentiation going on (citing
them along with interpreting specific poems).
Ron Silliman, if I understood his response to this correctly, acknowledged
that the Language poets, among others, do carry on the Pound/Olson
"modernizing project" to some degree; and then he made a specifically
political analysis of this, linking Blasing's kind of argument (divide
and conquer?) with reactionary attacks in the 50s (C. Greenberg).  This
I suppose implies Blasing is one of the "bad guys"; but she's writing
literary history: in which context, it's ultimately irrelevant whether
Poundian modernism's aesthetic choices are good are bad.  The question is,
were there some poets who went in a different direction, and questioned
these assumptions?  If so, shouldn't THEY be called the POSTmoderns,
and not those "avant-garders" who carry on MODernism?
 
It's easy to make fun of these kinds of "academic" issues; it's easy
also for poets to rail against the power of critics, and raise the
banners of the poor uncanonized multitudes out there.  But maybe more
talented poets might get read and heard if they themselves didn't
rehash and repeat the hackneyed & half-baked critical jargons that
pass for "movements", "techniques", etc.   - Henry Gould

Don't you hear *anything* in your head when you look at it on the page,
Peter?  The consonant cluster "st" evokes a sound, doesn't it?  Likewise
with the "r".  The fact that there's an asterisk rather than the expected
vowel doesn't change the fact that it's pronounceable (ancient Hebrew has no
vowels either), although it does problematize it. There may not be an exact
equivalent in sound to what Nichol's trying to get at on the page, but I can
think of at least 6 ways of reading this aloud off the top of my head, and
were I to perform this poem I might do all 6 of them in sequence to try to
compensate for the lack of a single sonic equivalent.  Whether I'd succeed
in that gets back to the matters of taste I was talking about, but it
doesn't change my mind re:  locking language up into any single sense-organ.
I don't think it happens that way.

If one wanted to reduce all of modernism to these two assumptions, and claim
that the "properly postmodern" would only need to question them, sure.
However, I find this reduction highly suspect.  I think there's more to
modernism than this, and I think there's more to postmodernism than simply
resisting the assumptions of modernism described here.  Sorry, but I'm not
buying.

Interestingly I hear many more than six possibilities. I can help but "see"
sometimes with computer glasses (I am after all reading this on a screen)

Does this mean that "*" would stand for the entire language (& beyond), thus
comprising the most economically compressed poem possible? Wow.
 
This also brings to mind Bill Manhire's "Asterisk Machine", and the fact that
many poems use an asterisk to denote breaks between stanzas/sections. Of
course, its use for footnotes makes it an all-purpose signifier, a hypertext
link, click here*. Not to mention the way in which it can bowdlerize words like
"f*ck".
 
I once wrote a found poem that consisted of lines about rain, including Eliot's
"a damp gust bringing rain" & Larkin's "an arror-shower somewhere becoming
rain" (I was interested in the way that the use of words like "rain" as
signifiers for emotional states could be constructed, not just socially, but by
very personal experiences). I used an asterisk between the two sections of the
poem, and soon after writing it I remembered a line from Wellington poet Geoff
Cochrane: "asterisks of rain are falling on the many old tin roofs"
(approximate quote). To me this seemed to complete the poem, but of course
no-one got the allusion.
 
This is also an example of the computer output modifying a poem. On my
terminal, the asterisk is five-pointed: in other fonts, it has six points.
Would bpNichol's "st*r" be read differently in each case? With a five-pointer
perhaps echoing a pentacle, and the six-pointer the Star of David? Of course, a
seven-pointer would have to be Australian.

Joe, I'm not sure I can answer your question - are you looking for where
Blasing fits in on the poetry map (like in the chart that was in the NY
Times magazine section a few months ago)?  She's not so easily placeable
up/down right/left.  The book cites a full array of poets, critics &
culture theorists.  You're trying to get at her intellectual genealogy?
This is her second book, her first was a medieval-like typology of
19th-20th cent. american poetry via an analysis of each poet's
dominant rhetorical strategy ("American Poetry: the Rhetoric of its
Forms", Yale UP, 1987).  I found it fascinating & incredibly, boldly
reductive.  But here's a long quote from pp. 18-19 of the new book, which
I think shows the essence of her critical approach:
 
   "I would like to reapproach the political issue via De Man's idea of
the "aporia" between the materiality of language and its meaning.  De Man
traces an irreducible divide between grammar and meaning, betyween tropes as su
ch and their meanings, between words or sentences and the statements they make,
 between letter and the words they spell, down to the distinction between a let
ter as material, blank mark and the letter as sign, a mark recognizable as a fu
nction in a sign system.  This gap in language - this permanent "errancy of lan
guage which never reaches the mark" - what Walter Benjamin calls history," De M
an writes.  History in this sense may be understood as the political linkage be
tween structure and meaning, between an "inhuman"materiality of events and the
"human" history of "meaningful" events.  Thus, in de Man's words, "the nonmessi
anic, nonsacred, that is the POLITICAL aspect of history is the result of the P
OETICAL structure of language." [caps for italics]
    "If we appropriate this scheme for poetry, the divide between form and cont
ent becomes the condition for the functioning of poetic language.  The prevaili
ng dogma that the specialness of poetic language lies in the inseparability of
its form and content then appears to be a historically specific ideology,
a particular convention of getting from the conventionality of the signifier to
 intentional meanings.  This is the generic convention of Romantic and modern o
rganicist models of peotic language, and it has shaped readings of all kinds of
 poetry, at the expense of repressing historical differences.
    "Only by insisting on the separateness of form and content can we make hist
orical distinctions between varieties of poetry.  That is, if we locate the gap
 between form and meaning inside poetic structure, we can address the rhetorica
l - that is political and historical - bridgings of this aporia.  Rhetoric, the
 motivated troping of the literal material into the figurative superstructure,
leaves this negotiation between form and meaning open to viewe - to FURTHER neg
otiation.  Any scheme that would repress this intentional negotiation and argue
 the inseparability of a poem,'s material base and its meaningful superstructur
e would be a species of aestheitc ideology.
    "Rhetoric as a political, persuasive figuration of the material code into m
eaning bears witness that meanings are not inherent int he material.  If poetry
 has a generic and general political function, it may be to show us HOW it cons
tructs itsel;f as a discourse that in turn constructs a meaningful world, natur
e, and self.  Thus poetry always has a sociopolitical valence, because it foreg
rounds the distance between its structure - the generic, linguistic, and repres
entational codes that govern its substitutions - and its meaning.  Poetry is no
 more reducible to any given set of formal practices than to meanings; it names
 the distance between the two.  It is the text of the historically and metaphys
ically unstable rhetoric that persuades the trope, letter, or form to mean.  An
y naturalization of the code as inherently meaningful fits the material fact in
to an already meaningful whole of some purposive, progressive history.
   "From this perspective, any claims for the inherent value of any given form
must be veiwed with suspicion.  ...If both open and closed forms are netural co
nventions, poetry's underlining its constructedness - the implicit, generic
persuasions of its forms and conventions, including the criteria that distingui
sh poetiuc discourse from others at a given instance and mark it AS a separate
discourse - may well constitute its usefulness.  That is, the more nonutilitari
an and special poetic language sounds, the more it represents itself as convent
ion-bound and emphasizes its own figuration, the more it fulfills its unique an
d generic, inherently critical function."
 
End of quote.  One can see clearly how distanced this is from Pound's ideogram
claims, Olsons form = content manifestos, the New Formalists organic claims for
 the pentameter, etc.  To me it reads very Dantesque & medieval: the convention
ality of letters is the source of rhetorical freedom & the visionary, political
formulations of poetic allegory.  Ironically considering Blasing's diatribe aga
inst language poetry, it reads almost as a language poetry manifesto, shorn of
its "historically specific" political provocations (& muddles).  This is why I
in part I find this rather exciting & "21st century" - it offers a critical gro
und for a kind of fusion or rapprochment between some very archaic & ancient co
ncepts of form, genre, & motivation in poetry, with some very current, and on t
he surface very different-sounding, poets.

cerebral palsy at birth, non-ambulatory, lived in Massachusetts until
1978, then Berkeley. First book published by Robert Creeley in 1953,
over the past 35 years, Larry authored more than 40 books--some
recent ones:  _Areas/Lights/Heights: Writings 1954-1989_ (Roof,
1989); _Windows Walls Yards Ways_ (Black Sparrow, 1994).  Work
appeared in _Origin_, _The Black Mountain Review_, _L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E_,
and in Donald Allen's _The New American Poetry_.  Important to many
poets, among them Denise Levertov and Robert Duncan, and a good many

Subject:      Re: challenges: re: Joe's post(long)
 
thanx much henry, very helpful in understanding blasing's orientation... i
can't say (again, from the excerpt) that blasing's approach at all appeals
to me... in fact it seems to me to seriously distort things by suggesting
that poetic discourse finds its value in the isolation of form from
content, in relying on a structural gap between meaning-as-convention/trope
and meaning-as-material given... when in fact i'd argue that poetry is
valuable precisely b/c it resists/explores this sort of separation---both
form and content of form *matter*, however much one may collapse into the
other in context... true, the assumption that materiality is ipso facto a
way of transcending 'mere' rhetoric might be a problem... but clearly for
olson, for example, and whatever misgivings i may have regarding his larger
poetic project, this 'fact' is not assumed---he is continually invested in
showing how and why materiality is a human issue... which for him opens to
the question of language practices that do not posit a passive, disengaged
mind...
 
anyway, that form and signification are intimately bound up with each other
(and in clearly ideological ways)  seems *not*, in fact, to have caught on
in, say, most late 20th. century scientific-technical discourse (not
explicitly, anyway)... which would imply that privileging a poetry that
operates on such a (presumed) gap may in fact unwittingly lend political
legitimacy to more restrictive and orthodox military-industrial-corporate
rhetorics (!---i'm not joking)... that is, to argue that language practices
are more properly/constructively political the more they revel in their own
rhetorical-content limitations or biases (and the more they play down their
material manifestations) may result, oddly enough, in a poetic platform
that plays to the dominant discourses, b/c in these latter attention is
generally paid only to surface rhetoric, convention, language as a
functional-representational medium, "applied" ex post facto to knowledge
production---language practice, that is, as inherently disengaged from
political practice not b/c of its rhetorical reflexiveness but b/c of its
ideological neutrality... i mean, reflexiveness to the nth. degree can
result in a perceived absence of political value, however much one regards
this as a useful "politics"...
 
the best way i know to highlight the inadequacy of such reductive 'logic'
(and btw, i do so every semester i teach 'tech. writing') is to stress the
material forms of signification, to ask repeatedly why and how form itself
has been rendered neutral in this culture through the continued
proliferation of forms upon forms upon forms... to see such container
metaphors as metaphors, to make their transparency apparent, is pretty easy
once one takes a look at various 20th. century poetries... from another
pov, to believe that political liberation is attainable through sheer
alteration of form is equally wrong-headed ... in either case i'd want to
ask whose interests are being served?...
 
it's not a far cry from a politics predicated on rhetorical innovation
alone to a politics predicated on a neutral rhetoric to a politics
predicated on a formal-material given... i mean to say that, for me, a
desirable politics in fact requires something more than any of these
orientations... but it seems to me that what's missing are some material
links, and i don't just mean language... i mean thinking through the
materiality of bodies, etc...
 
anyway, i'll chew this over some more... i'd love to hear what others think
about all this...

Henry Gould,
Apologies if my comments were overly abrasive however my comments on the
Blasing book were not based on ESP-- I have read a fair amount of the book. I
am not contesting her thesis regarding form, though that might be done, I
think for the large part she is correct that form is not inherently
political, or inherently anything else. Mark Wallace in _Witz_ articulates a
similar position in his call for "a free multiplicity of form." & the Rasula
book is excellent re the recent history of this debate. My concern is most
strongly signified by the 4 poets the book examines, & echoes Joe A. --
"whose interests are being served?..." The inclusion of a less pedigreed poet
or two would mean something, instead we're given the rhetorical construction
of a center. I don't think it's unreasonable to point to questions of
canonicity & institutional power here.
This also seems to me to relate to Charles B.'s distinction between "radical
modernism" (most of Stein, Williams of _Imagiations_, Khlebnikov, etc.) and
conservative modernism (Williams of "Red Wheelbarrow," Stevens, etc.). I.e.
I'm not sure the rhetorical complexity Blasing argues for, and calls
"postmodern," is to be found only in the post-WWII Ivy League.
--Rod
PS-- not sure CB used the term "conservative modernism," can't find the cite.

Subject:      Greenberg/Cage/Eigner
 
Dear Rod and,
 
The names Greenberg tacks to the end of the paragraph I cited
on the avant-garde are Henry Miller and John Crowe Ransom.  CG
writes: "[I]t is a fact that there has been a certain regiment-
ation of the avant-garde, a standardization of its attitudes, which--
whether the attitude be Henry Miller's or John Crowe Ransom's--
threatens to impose a new academicism on us" (255).  Giving that
choice of examples some point might have been the fact that Ransom was
also a contributor to the PARTISAN REVIEW forum (as were John Berryman,
R.P. Blackmur, Robert Gorham Davis, Leslie Fiedler, Wallace Stevens,
Lionel Trilling, and H. L. Mencken).
 
Incidentally, James E. B. Breslin points out that when Wallace Stevens
"characterized the age as one no longer conducive to poetic
experimentation" in the same PR forum, Ransom "happily concurred" (FROM
MODERN TO CONTEMPORARY [1984] 11)--just as, to blur threads a moment, I
feel quite sure Mutlu Blasing would concur today.
 
That Greenberg's piece as a whole is light on proper names, with their
inevitable and cumbersome specificities, is probably a strategic decision.
It is also the case that by the mid-40s, CG had shifted out of his earlier
practice of writing almost as often about literature as about the visual
arts.  The first volume of the COLLECTED ESSAYS AND CRITICISM opens with a
piece on Brecht; has a piece called "Renaissance of the Little Mag"
(discussing ACCENT, DIOGENES, EXPERIMENTAL REVIEW, VICE VERSA, and VIEW);
includes reviews of books by John Wheelwright, Marianne Moore, Jarrell,
Blackmur, Spender, and others;
shows CG panning Laughlin's 1941 NEW DIRECTIONS IN PROSE AND POETRY;
has a "discussion" of "Mr. Eliot and Notions of Culture"; und so weiter.
 
By contrast, the second volume swerves out of the museums and galleries
only seldomly--he castigates the Bollingen Committee for the award
to Pound, he calls Valery incapable of thinking, he writes appreciatively
of recent books by Ernst Cassirer and Bernard Berenson, but the emphasis
has definitely shifted paintward.
 
Another paragraph from the "State of American Writing, 1948" piece
grabbed my attention by seeming in such open contrast to Spicer's
premise in 1949 OCCIDENT forum, with those plaintive questions
"Why is nobody here? Who is listening to us" (rpt. in ONE NIGHT STAND
90-92).  CG, obviously responding to a leading question about the status of
poetry's audience, writes:
 
"It would appear true that the poetry of the past has a diminish-
ing audience; Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth do not see to be read
by anywhere near as large a proportion of the cultivated public
as they used to be.  But the popularity of contemporary poetry
increases steadily and increases phenomenally, and the successful
poet still dominates the literary and academic scene, even if he
is not read by as many people as the novelist is.  It strikes me
as risky to say that poetry has had 'an ever diminishing audience'
in recent years" (256).
 
I post all this despite Ron's more ranging and eloquent summary
of Greenberg both in his recent posts and in the POETICS JOURNAL
article on "Postmodernism"--from which I learned a lot about the
aftermath of Greenberg's legacy in the 70s, as manifested in the
struggles to define the editorial project of ARTFORUM at mid-decade--
only because I have been dipping into the COLLECTED ESSAYS AND
CRITICISM for the first time and welcome some chance to discuss
them.  What I've liked best is reading Greenberg more or less
simultaneously with the wonderful M U S I C A G E, which I just
finished last night.  There is a wonderful interference that comes
of addressing oneself to Greenberg by way of Cage, and Cage by
way of Greenberg, rather like what seeing the ROLYWHOLYOVER circus
sweep into the museums must have been like (I missed it).
 
A last note, in another mood.  Just a few days ago, I finished
Ernst Pawel's last work, a biography of Heine's last years in
Paris (the years of the "mattress-grave") called THE POET DYING.
Last night, I was devastated upon reading Joan Retallack's quiet
note about Cage's death just days after her final interview with
him.  And now Hank Lazer tells us of Larry Eigner's being gone.
When I open Eigner's SELECTED, it is to a broadside he
published the year I was born (1965):

in general, i might agree with that statement.  sometimes the push to use

"pomo" or even "postmodern" on a frequent basis?
 
there's a difference between trying to change the thoughts of millions of
people spread out over generations (i.e. telling people that they shouldn't
use any of the various derogitory racial terms, which are not merely
apolitical symbols, but representations of prejudiced thought), and it's
quite another to tell (mostly) academics that an abrieviation they've
chosen (which indicates little more than they really think olson coined a
'really long word') was already taken.

there's a passage in Whitman's notebooks, somewhere, to the effect that:
 
the second time the angels appeared in a vision to Swedenborg, they gave him

the first time, though, he was at a dinner party, and all they said was:

sorry to quote at such length but
(and) it's pretty late at night even in Tucson so I'll be less circumspect
than I prolly should be BUT:
 
this is pretty bizarre.  De Man all over the place insists on sticking a
giganto wedge between (say)(cf. that Dial-a-Critic special issue edited by
Warminski) what Wordsworth said he was doing and what the errancy & etc of
the language shows him to have done.  And versus Derrida, say, he sure  as
hell isn't all that interested in the former, and hardly (unlike Derrida)
even in the tension between the former and the latter: Wordsworth gets read
in terms of what the rhetoric (un)DOES and not at all in terms of the  hand
in the britches pocket that so bugged Keats.  So that (I haven't read the
book either & I'm a academic AND it's my field sorry sorry but) at least as
summarized, it's way bizarre for Blasing to claim to be coming out of de Man
when she asserts that Pound's "belief" (?) in the Chinese  written character
exhibits a faith and fixity unlike what de Man teaches us to value.  If de
Man and his ephebes can so successfully recycle the same cento of Wordsworth
passages (pieties) to exhibit the necessary instabilty of x y and z (and
they DO do it powerfully) it wouldn't be hard at all to play at being a de
Manian showing such instability (in spades squared) for the Cantos (cf. some
of Marjorie's "middle period" [?] work).
 
which is basically to second Steve Carl's recent post: at least as
paraphrased, the argument re the "moderns" is both molto predictable and a
gigantesque straw-person construction (cf. thirdbaseperson) that hides
virtually all of what's exciting about reading, say, Ole Ez (folding his
blankets).  I'd assume that (forgetting Whitman for the moment) Ez is MISTER
logo-poeia in a way that enabled big chunks of not only Charles and Ron but
gasp "even" Ashbery (though Eliot plays perhaps a bigger role in JA's
fugitive sense of idiom).
 
(btw "materiality" and "meaning" seems like an odd flattening out of the
more familiar de Manian performative/constative song and dance)

Subject:      Larry Eigner
 
When the University Art Museum celebrated Larry Eigner's work by
posting "Again Dawn" in humongous letters on the outside of the museum
and held the big reading with and for Larry, Kit Robinson and I did a
session with an earnest interviewer on the university radio station.
The interviewer wanted to make of the occasion an uplifting "my left
foot" kind of tale, amazed that someone so afflicted with cerebral
palsey could write poetry at all. But that of course was NOT the story.
The story might have been this: that one of the great poets of the 20th
century -- no further qualification needed -- happened to have had
cerebral palsey.
 
One value of that exhibition at UCB was that those of us who were there
had the opportunity to tell Larry just how much he meant to us all.
 
Like so many other readers, I had fallen entirely in love with Larry's
poetry long before I had any understanding of how challenged he was by
his own body. Even though David Gitin and others had tried to convey
this to me years before and I had all the evidence of his letters
beginning around 1969, back when I first wrote for some work for
Tottel's, when Larry first moved to Berkeley in 1978 my immediate
instinct was to call him on the phone! Over the years, as Larry's
speech improved markedly by his exposure to so many different people in
Berkeley (very different I gather from the isolation within his parents
house in Swampscott for 51 years), and as I also learned to listen, I
could and did have real conversations over the phone with him. And of
course in person. It was great good luck that Larry's brother had
settled in Berkeley.
 
Sun & Moon has a new book of Larry's forthcoming and there no doubt
must be hundreds, perhaps thousands, of poems yet to be collected.
Hopefully somebody (UC Press comes to mind as the logical place) will
put together a collected, edited by Grenier. In addition to Eigner's
own 40+ small press books, I would call people's attention to "Missing
'X'" by Barrett Watten (in _Total Syntax_) as a superb discussion of
the dynamics of Larry's work.

Subject:      challenges re: Amato, Smith, Nathanson
 
Tenney - I wrote in my first post on the Blasing book that this kind of
heavy duty critical summation of periods & styles is a blunt instrument
generically unfair about individual poets.  But how can you say, without
looking at the book, that it leaves out everything interesting about
poetry, Pound & others'?  I mean, on one level that's criticism's
eternal problem, & on that level I agree with you.  But on what I see
as Blasing's pivotal point - that a powerful stream of 20th century
avant-garde American poetry privileges ONE approach to rhetoric
(organicism: form = content), and that a lot of criticism has followed
their lead & missed something fundamental - on this point I find
her pretty persuasive.
 
Joe - what you write about form & content implicating each other is
exactly what Blasing gets into (& didn't come through in that long
quote).  Particularly in her chapter on Ashbery she writes about
the "containment" or commodification or mystification of politics
and "extra-textual" reality.  & I agree with both you & Rod Smith
about the political dangers of a kind of Olympian rhetorical nest
for poetry.  What Blasing emphasizes is that poetry has a political
role, a central role in culture, because in it rhetoric "shows its hand",
unveils its roots & mystifications.  Poetry that denies its link to
larger cultural discourses, that denies being tainted with rhetoric
and political persuasion, is just one more path to the ivory tower.
Rod, I agree with you that it would be more convincing
if these critics covered "uncanonical" renegade poets. It's
a cliche to say that such critics are rare.  You have to be pickled
before dissection.  - Henry Gould

There *is* a movement to foster gender-neutral pronouns, for the reasons you
cite as well as others.  Transgender activists and artists are using "ze" in
place of she, he, or s/he and "hir" instead of his or hers.  Forthcoming
from High Risk is a novel by lesbian transsexual performance artist Kate
Bornstein that makes use of these terms, and they've also appeared in a
number of queer zines/newspapers.  The new words appeal to me not only in
that one might use them when referring to "many people in the third person
singular," but when referring to one person whose gender is
ambiguous/flexible/intentionally indeterminate/etc.   The problem?  "Ze"
looks weird.  On the other hand, so did/does "Ms."

Perhaps I'm being naive, but isn't EP's famous translation of the
Chinese character for "sincerity"  (which also seems to found his
poetics) based on an acknowledgement of precisely that "gap" involved
in standing beside something, and so having to acknowledge your
(yikes!) freedom (quaint word, I know, but I can't do better) in
relation to it?

Subject:      form and politics
 
As regards the recent comments about the relation between form and
politics and Blasing's book, I think the problem there might usefully be
thought of in two ways: the difference between what's inherent in form
per se, and the way that poetic form has been politicized in this
century. To deny that there's a political element to form, as Blasing
does, and then to try to reinscribe the major traditional formalists of
this century is a pretty nasty trick, and shows how thoroughly she's NOT
interested in opening up formal possibilities--if she really believed in
attempting to undermine some poetic dichotomies that do need
examining--"radical" vs. "conservative," "experimental" vs.
"traditional"--she would not end up by speaking mainly about the writers
most vaunted by a conservative literary establishment. Her literary
politics are conservative, plain and simple, and in that context, her
argument that "form is not political" is simply part of what that
conservative literary establishment has been saying for awhile--"we're not
conservative or political, simply better." And that's utter bullshit.
 
I appreciate Rod's mention of my essay coming out in Witz (it hasn't
actually appeared yet, but Rod's already seen it), and I think he's right
also to point people in the direction of Rasula's book, which really
manages to contextualize the issue of poetic form and politics much more
accurately than is usually the case even among "avant garde" writers. But
my sense that a multiplicity of formal possibilities might also (and
probably do by definition) include reconfigurations of possibilities
sometimes disavowed by avant garde writers (lyric, narrativity) is by no
means an attempt to say that poetic form does not have political
implications. Nor is it an attempt to "return" to a more conservative
poetics, as some people have tried to tell me. Form has all sorts of
political implications in an
environment in which formal choices now come to seem almost by definition
to put one in a political camp--you write rhymed verse and you're a
"conservative," you use parataxis and you're a "radical." Far from
attempting to deny that distinction, I think it needs to be pushed
further so that it can collapse. Can formal "experimentation" also
include distortions of sonnet, of rhyme--I think a number of writers are
proving that it can. Can parataxis become a codified way of indicating to
others that you are practicing the proper avant garde traditions? I think
that's also true. IN such a situation, "radical" and "conservative"
stances begin to get more mixed up.But of course those questions themselves
could also be turned around in countless directions.
 
         The question of opening up possibilities of form implies, I think,
that 'avant garde' writers need to resist too settled
distinctions about form, because such settling could have the result in
turning avant garde writers merely into defenders of their own set of
poetic forms, rather than leading them to seek new possibilities for
formal "mutation."
 
        Blasing wants to say 'form is not political' so that everybody
will go back again to reading Robert Lowell (or whoever) at the expense
of all sorts of other writers. Now Lowell may be more interesting than
avant garde writers sometimes give him credit for, but he's by no means
so interesting that he should be read at the expense of many far more
interesting poets of this century (and everybody out there knows who they
are...). To say that "radical" vs. "conservative" are rather weak
metaphors for some of the complexity of poetic forms (which they are) is not
the same as
denying that there is a politically and aesthetically conservative
literary establishment that wants to deny people access to inventive
modes of writing. Blasing's book is a disinformation campaign
masquerading as a real engagment with questions of poetic form.

  Dear tenney--
   I like your pointing out of a methodological contradiction in Blasing's
   rather selective appropriation of De Man (Pound vs. Wordsworth).
   What always bugged me about De Man though was that he REDUCES even what
   Wordsworth SAYS he's doing so he can claim all this "unintentional
   excess"--and yes of course it's unintentional. But more like Kant's
   purposeful purposelessness. (i.e. as Shelley says "poets are...the
   words they understand not").
   Also, I'm glad you qualified POUND as MISTER LOGOPEIA---
   For Marisa Januzzi (and others?) suggest that LOY was MS. (sorry emily)
   LOGOPEIA---and pound may have even stole it. chris s.

Simon S
 
weren't you in New York (or were you in DC or were you in China) when
langpo became the de facto fourth gen NY School? if so, would you really
subscribe to the myth that the NYS scene at that point was a gang of
no-nothing zen hooligans? I don't really think (even at their earliest,
most Padgett/Berrigan-doped) Steve Levine and Gary Lenhart count as
anti-intellectuals (no matter what Gary may have written to you in a
rejection slip, Chris). I would guess that the influence of Ted was the
touchstone for inclusion in the "gang", though, and that that influence was
restrictive to the point of intolerance (probably.. I was about six at the
time). This may or may not account for the "reverse discrimination" you
(and everybody else in the world) get from a CERTAIN UNNAMED LANGUAGE POET
IN NEW YORK, Chris. Or maybe he's just like that. But I find the idea of
"sensibility" as developed by Levine, Lenhart, Greg Masters, Eileen Myles,
Rochelle Kraut and Elinor Nauen, Maggie Dubris, Barb Barg, Bob Rosenthal
not exactly "anti-intellectual" (if not influenced by Derrida, De Man,
Deleuze, Zizek etc. either). More like an earnest (over-earnest?) extension
of Ted/Alice's project of poet as 24 hr, well, poet.

It will be available in the August - December season.
 
Also, you should be on the lookout for our wonderful new web-site, which
will be up tomorrow. I'll be posting an address today or tomorrow. It will
be a wonderful in-depth site, with all Sun & Moon listings (eventually),
information on the authors, ordering form, and dozens of links.

Subject:      trail blasing re: Mark Wallace
 
Mark : one question: have you read the Blasing book?  She never, ever,
says "form is not political".  She never mentions Robert Lowell.
Her argument is that all writing is rhetorically based; that all
rhetoric is persuasion and thus political.  She writes about
the 4 poets mentioned because they work in both open & traditional
forms.  To claim that Blasing makes value judgements based on
cultural snobbery would have to be backed up by some specifics.
To make these assumptions based only on the knowledge that she
wrote about a certain 4 poets is jumping the cwitical gun.
    Lemme try to clarify.  She wrote that form has been politicized
in the US for a long time.  One way form has been politicized is
by reifying certain rhetorical choices as being "natural", "organic",
thus closer to the truth - and claiming that they are thus non-rhetorical;
this kind of poetry doesn't NEED to persuade because it mirrors
nature.  Her counter-current, her postmodernists, move in a
different direction - emphasizing the un-natural, political nature
of forms; showing their rhetorical hand & the political choices
that this involves. - Henry Gould

Or,
and isn't that the best way to begin a post,
isn't the problem of _readability_ with st*r
that we know right away what we're reading?
that there's no delay of assembly, no language
acquisition involved? I don't mean that
everything should be written in another language
but don't these puzzleworks get more (games?
mazes?) through when there's some question
of readability? "Y**r D**k" by Padgett or
"Prom in Toledo Night" by Ann Lauterbach
are two examples of nearly readable works
that develop and sustain.. what.. something

of the subject brought forward as representative of the group and (2)
seems to assume that representative would in fact feel *hurt* by a usage

Subject:      Larry Eiger (1927-1996) [long post]
 
I can't collect my thoughts any further, dwelling on the meanings
of Larry Eigner's life, except to remember the time spent with
him in conversation, or say the time Bob Grenier, Brian McInerney
and I took him to the Museum of Natural History on his one trip
to New York.  As we came into the room with some of the largest
dinosaurs, Larry pointed straight ahead and said "that's
interesting".  He wasn't pointing to a dinosaur skeleton, though,
but to an old sign posted on the back wall; it _was_ interesting,
in a style long banished (in exhibition halls now replaced).  I
think of that remark of Larry's as displaying how much he lived
out his version of a democracy of particulars, as against the
craving for highlights, for the heightened, that is as much a
literacy aesthetic as a consumer imperative.  For Eigner, this
didn't mean a flattening of affect; on the contrary it meant a
luminosity of every detail: the perceptual vividness that his
work so uncannily concatenates.  This acknowledgement of the
daily, a series of remarks on the otherwise unremarkable, a sort
of poetic alchemy that is not dissimilar to one strain of Jewish
mysticism (a strain in which the mysticism dissolves into an
active apprehension of the real), is an abiding model of and for
a poetry where things as they are let to stand for themselves.
 
This poet of the ordinary lived an extraordinary life, as if the
physical challenges he faced since birth were spun by poetic
license into mental acrobatics.  Larry Eigner is hero of our
times.  His will to think was unsuppressible.  It was no ordinary
privilege to have known him.  I can't think of anyone I admired
more.
 
 
*******************
I wrote this for an Eigner celebration at UC-Berkeley's
University Art Museum in June 1993:
 
 
AGAIN EIGNER
 
There is no writing I know as vivid as Larry Eigner's.  He's
invented, for poetry, something equivalent to three-dimensional
photography: his works present a series of perceptions etched
deep into the mind, where the mind is charted on a page and the
page becomes a model of the thinking field.  Perception and
thought (words and things) are completely intertwined in Eigner's
work, which brings to a visionary crescendo the exploration of
the ordinary -- the transient flickerings of the everyday that
otherwise pass more unnoticed than regarded, more dismissed than
revered.  In Eigner's poems, one "fragment" is rivetted to the
next, so that one becomes, in reading this work, likewise riveted
by the uncanny democracy of details, where attention is focussed
unhesitatingly on each particular with equal weight, equal
exhilaration.  This is a poetics of "noticing things," where, as
Eigner writes, "nothing is too dull" with "material (things,
words) more and more dense around you."  But equally, Eigner's is
a poetics of coincidence, where "serendipity" (contingency) takes
its rightful place as animating spirit, displacing the
anthropocentric sentimentality of much of the verse of our time.
 
 
 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
 
In 1988, Leslie Scalapino's O Books republished Eigner's
"Anything on Its Side" in O One/An Anthology, for which I wrote
this verse commentary:
 
 
"THE ONLY WORLD WE'VE GOT"
 
 
_Anything on Its Side_ is placed, like
 
a volume in a tank of water, with utter
 
gravity against the next moment that occurs
 
in what is called time but for Eigner is always
 
spaced, for example on a page.  What
 
would it be to be grounded, to know
 
the ground under you by the weight
 
it pushes back with?  "Every atom of me
 
 . . . across distances."  No awful trembling
 
unto undecidability, everything founded in
 
its site, cleaves to what there is, to
 
what is there.  "_To be_ is involved
 
such words that hold / times in the mind":
 
a way, still, that a poem can enact its
 
own presence, with full measure of the
 
necessary determination to move from
 
anything to that which juts against it,
 
a conviction that life is made of (of)
 
just such leaps, the contingency of an eye
 
(aye, I) 'gainst a field of "r/oars" ("_suddenly_
 
a day").  Something like deep
 
focus, as if the poems had become
 
an organ, the sky bellows.  Step by
 
step, slowly turning.  Yet there is no
 
opening onto image here, no mime of
 
a rehearsal of a scene. Eigner's depth-of-
 
field _charges_ each page to _hold_ its own,
 
"to have things whole".  "to see / dark
 
the / invisible".  Perception all right,
 
but not sun-drenched barns: "fishmongers",
 
"pigment", "air".  If there's
 
narrative, it's narrative unhinged
 
of causal nexus, logical spools.  Each
 
line rivets its moment & moves on, like
 
angels on the head of a quill pin, nor
 
looks ahead nor back, but "bangs" indissoluble
 
at precise splice ("each fief") that
 
bodies the moment from one to next.  "to
 
negotiate the ocean drop by drop
 
if there were time".  In adjacency
 
is act-uality: "you thought it was
 
as it is".  Nuggets of sound carving
 
space.  "Motion" "motor" "process"
 
"winds" "bells" "floating" "echoing"
 
"coursing" "falling" "roaming" "wading"
 
"spilling" "flying" "dazzling" "burning"
 
"unflagging" "blows" "stirs" "curves"
 
"spirals" "stagger" "dives" "slips"
 
"slicks" "shakes" "hums" "simmers"
 
"twist" "float" "flap" "dangle" "glitter"
 
"subside": "_imagine_ the extent" (a
 
geometry of ties that blind in music,
 
"the great sea orchestrated with men"--
 
"what's unseen" "what sound for our
 
ears").  What is "_displaced_" at each
 
juncture is the plenitude of eyes seeing
 
beyond sight, the replenishment of
 
occlusion's hold, storehouse of an
 
interior horizon s(t)olid as emplacement.
 
"What you / see you / settle / on"--
 
settlement, homestead in the moment's
 
whole, "such words that hold" nor need
 
an other embrace.  "your eyes open" "we
 
_see_ something to _say_ or / listen to".
 
Imagine the extent.

One of the rituals of Jewish funerals is to rip a piece of clothing as an

ripped piece of cloth to your jacket so as to avoid actual damage to your
actual expensive tie.)

Subject:      Re: warning: i break for hallucinations
 
    Dear Ron--
     it is very kind of you to hope that I "brake" rather than "break"
     against the force of the "bad-cop", so thanks....
     thanks also for the greenberg piece (interesting to see the differences
     between what Steve Evans quotes and what you do---Steve seems to make
     him a more sympathetic radical than you).
     As for your overall assessment of CG's influence, I pretty much agree.
     In fact, a more than a little HOMOPHOBIA may be detected in his writings
     On Still---(link with "whitman" "indulging" in "loose" "gestures" etc).
     Are THE FOUR QUARTERTS really SNOOZERS? and SLACK though????????
     Is Bishop really a NEw Criterian type?
     At one point you suggest "a political gap between [CG and the NC's]
     in the 1930s" that closed by the 1950s, because CG moved to the right.
     Yet (in Rasula's book---I have not read Golding, but this is only because
     I was given Rasula's---"college on foodstamps," etc---not a judgment!)
     Rasula shows that the NC's themselves appealed to MARXIST rhetoric
     quite a bit in the 30's (in fact, it's QUITE interesting to see this)
     so i don't know quite what you mean about this GAP.
     If it's a gap, it may be the gap between RHETORIC and PRACTICE, all along.
     And yes, I too wonder
        "WHAT ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM WOULD BE IF IT HAD NOT HAD ITS CONTEXTU-
         ALIZING FRAMEWORK (from CG) FROM DAY ONE"---
    And this is why I brought it up. I think we can turn CG's statements
    about Eliot around pretty easily, and fault greenberg's writing for not
    living up to the art of DeKooning, Still, etc.
    Actually, O'Hara did do this in his art crit methinks.....

Jordan,
 
He probably just gave up before the pyrotechnical Paccino.
 
I think the only interesting thing about _Heat_ was how horrible all the
stars looked, but how gorgeously photographed their backdrops were.  Ugly
human beings in a designer world.

i could live with ze. but reading your and other comments sparked in memory
banks a simpler idea--'e' (which could or could not be capitalized). this
puts 3rd person on equal footing with 1st (and 2nd person just being a more
complex spelling of another vowel, we have some consistency among the
pronouns)) with
'es' as the possessive form.

Tom,
Often, interestingly, "" (or its variant '') stands for language that does
not act.* All words outside the "'s are action words. File "this", search
"that", compress "this", say "this". (Or as computer folks like to say: type
"foo".) However the recipients of those actions are the inert words. For
computers it would search "dog" or say "hello". To this code, the shagginess
of the former or the warmth of the latter are of no concern.
So that you have the curious situation that yes, "*" would stand for the
entire language, but it is a language that is simply irrelevant to the
"task" at hand.

*The one case you picked out, "*," is the only case where it is simply *
(where we can enjoy its number of points)...

Re homophobia among the New Critics: Golding cites an incident in his
footnotes in which John Crow Ransom pulled Robert Duncan's African
Elegy from the galleys of the Kenyon Review after learning of the
publication of The Homosexual in Society. Alan does a good job of
noting how various folks (Creeley, etc.) felt about those journals and
that scene. (And if I recall rightly, Tom Clark also comments on
Olson's attempts to appear in such magazines as well. "Projective
Verse" appeared in Poetry NY, a curious venue to say the least.)

Jordan,
 
yes I was in New York when I was talking about.  I think there's a little
muddle about generations, I probably overcounted (isn't Edwin Denby the
first generation all by himself of the NY school?).  the names you note
are certainly not know-nothing vulgar zennists.  I was referring more to
a generalized concept of Bernadette's own cohort.  as far as I can tell,
Bob Rosenthal and Charles Bernstein are contemporaries, ditto for the
other names you list and other language poets.  they are a different
reaction at the same general moment to a situation in downtown lit.
 
actually you might have titled your post "monday night origin" since it
was the monday night reading series (then curated or whatever the verb
is) by Ed Friedman which was catalytic.  but also important were two
writing workshops at the poetry project, one led by bernadette (before I
got there) and another led by alice notley, which was I think fall 1976.
 
also, I wouldn't say that Ted B or Alice represented any sort of vulgar
zen anti-intellectualism.  but their return to new york is already after
langpo seemed to get going.  (disclaimer: west coast language writers are
a literary history I don't know at all).
 
one thing which  did distinguish the language poets from Steve Levine, Gary
Lenhart, etc etc, it seems to me, was the language side's interest in and
willingness to theorize and explicate what they were doing.  one reason
that I can't think of a label to link together the writers "of
sensibility" that you listed is that none of them write a lot of
criticism.  of course, another is that they are unfortunately less widely
known.  (I guess there are some exceptions.)  if these posts stirs up
some interest in their works then my premature foray into writing my
memoirs here has not been pointless.
 
finally, as maestro holman notes, everybody was just there, coats on the
same beds at the same parties.

Simon, Bob,
Thanks. "The double beds piled with coats" as Steve Malmude wrote.
Anyway, I do point people towards Gary Lenhart's prose, which seems to me
the best critical writing from the standpoint of _sensibility_ out there
right now. His essays on Kenneth Koch, Anne Porter, Ted Berrigan and most
recently Anselm Hollo are worth looking at for their "ornery piety". But I
also liked Murat Nemet-Nejat's fine rabblerousing essay on Jabes in
Exquisite Corpse a couple years ago.

I like this mixing up of pronouns; in fact I think we should mix them up
more.  Eventually a few will be sifted out and used more commonly, and
in the meantime, figuring out the words will make people think.
I vote for "ze" myself.  "e" sounds too much like he, especially as h's are
dropped in many dialects.  Hearing "e" I think of my friend from Fall
River who pronounced "human" "yooman".

One of the great surprises to me upon moving to the Bay area in '87 was
hearing the conversations between Eigner and poet friends around town.  I
was never able to undersatnd Larry Eigner's speech, but poets who had
gotten to know him carried on deeply interesting conversations with him,
which I followed as best I could as if listening to one side of a phone
conversation.
 
Which is by way of lead up to mention that at the conclusion of that
tremendous tribute reading fro Eigner at Berkeley, Eigner gave an
extended reading himself.  Hearing his reading of the work gave me a new
sense of his use of line break and space --  not sure I can explain it,
but I think I had been reading over the line breaks too quickly before --
 
By the way -- anyone seen Andrea Wyat, who edited the old selected
Eigner, in recent years -- Last saw her in D.C. in about '83 -- haven't
heard of her since --

ryan, what would it take to establish "the epistemological stability of the
authenticity
of the subject brought forward as representative of the group"?... in this
case, in pragmatic terms, this *could* result in deciding not to alter
one's vocabulary unless the 'entire' pomo nation/people comes forward
requesting same... and surely 'entire' is problematic here too... ergo, i
defer to the many past controversies over such issues rather than seek out
such "authenticity"... we can all think of a number of monikers and the
like that have come under scrutiny and have been rejected/discontinued b/c
they (may have) furthered damaging stereotypes... why isn't such past
knowledge sufficient to altering present behavior?... or am i to assume
that this sort of public strategy wrt language practice merely contributes
to oppression?... this latter, btw, resonates well with the retro\backlash
territory settled in the past six-seven years by conservatives who decry us
'liberal pedagogues' for advocating 'political correctness' (which latter
term, for this reason, you'll rarely hear me even use)... for me the issue
here is pretty straightforward:  i've been using a term, as have some
others, for some time now that may, may contribute inadvertently to a
cultural oversight...
 
as to whether a "representative would in fact feel *hurt* by a usage that
pretty obviously has no referential relationship, injurious or otherwise,
to an ethnological moniker s/he may in fact wish to interrogate in the
first place":  i'm not certain that this is a fair assertion, given that
it's highly unlikely a "representative" CAN "in fact feel *hurt*" in the
absence of any injurious "referential relationship"!... the question is
whether in fact there might BE such a relationship... now:  are you seeking
some phenomenological *proof* that folks can be "hurt" through mindless
acts of linguistic appropriation?... i for one take this latter on faith
these days, hence i have no desire to 'prove' same... at the same time, as
you suggest, using pomo for postmodern is clearly not quite the same as
using a racial moniker with ill intent, to designate inferiority etc... yet
i'd have to say, again, that i see no harm at all in trying to find another
word, given that there's a clear overlap here in usage that may, may result
in some residual *hurt*, given what we (imnsho, should already) know...
 
the cultural-linguistic reality many of us would seem to be inhabiting --
and critical spheres are no exception -- permits for all sorts of
neologisms and buzz words, not least b/c of that corporate cutting &
pasting of the public sphere that seems fully intent on splintering and
recombining parts of speech and offering the result back to us as a
subsidiary linguistic enterprise... for that matter, i'm all for poets,
scholars, etc., working with the stuff of language as they see fit, but i
would hope to find here a somewhat different sensibility and orientation,
one more conditioned by sensitivities toward history, social context, and
affect...  it's obvious that we're likely to wrench apart (and wrench
together) cultural heritages in some strange and unintended ways whatever
we do, simply b/c words carry that sort of historical baggage... but i ask
again:  if we are confronted with reasonable evidence that a term of recent
origin has in fact inadvertently, and homophonically, stumbled across the
living heritage of a marginalized group, what is the harm in trying to
attend to this by altering our usage?...

How is "pomo" linguistic appropriation? Who feels the need to protect a
defenseless people? Should we not use "roam" because of Rome, "grease"
because of Greece, "turkey" because of Turkey, etc.? Should we finally
purify our language - the nazis would have liked that, no? We can cleanse
it of any homonyms.
 
"Pomo" has been used for postmodernism. It is also the name of a nation
of Native Americans. So what? It's clear that the meanings are entirely
different and certainly there is no intended or unintended slur one way
or the other.
 
What I resent is this notion of purity that underlies the discussion.

(I want to make it clear that "defenseless people" is sarcastic here. Be-
cause I think there is a level of paternalism in the whole discussion. If
there were Pomo involved in this who felt it was a slur, it would be
entirely different. And even then, it would be necessary to ascertain
exactly where the slur lies.)

these pronouns might engender some dialogue:
wha? and huh? (choose your affiliation)
 
as in the famous hymnher:
YAHWEH WHO?
 
Wha? took off whe? pith helmet,
huh? took off heh? suspenders,
said wha? to huh?
Cocoa, nut?
Said huh? wha you say?
Oh nuttin, hih? say wha?

alan, purity?... who's talking purity?... you're quite correct in pointing
out that there are other similar homonyms, such as grease/greece... i mean,
yeah, language works this way... i thought i indicated that i understood
this much... who doesn't?... and who doesn't hope for a more hybrid
reality?...
 
but this opens to a sort of critique of what it is constitutes hybridity in
more political terms...
 
my point was that we *might consider* that the word *might* have a
derogatory effect on an indigenous group, period.
 
i'm assuming, of course, that we all, all of us understand the degree to
which native americans have suffered... that i seem to have ended up
speaking *for* same doesn't make me feel all that comfortable... there's
surely a presumption here on my part...  but it's a presumption born of
privilege---so my aim is to throw some doubt in the direction of those like
mself who operate from this place of privilege often w/o a whole lot of
critical intervention...

There's a sculpture garden in St. Paul with poetry engraved on walkways and
on sculpture, poems by poets from various local cultures. There's a bridge
by Siah Armijani a few years old (I'm not exactly sure just how old) in
Minneapolis from the Walker Art Center Sculpture Garden to Loring Park which
includes a text by John Ashbery. There's language all over art a la Jenny
Holzer, Barbara Kruger, and many more, some of these works being sculpture,
some prints, more rarely (but sometimes) paintings. The book arts has an
entire area of activity that is properly perceived as language sculpture or
sculpture with language.

Rachel Blau DuPlessis' 'Draft 22' in the latest Hambone (#12)
takes impulse from the Philadelphia Wireman's sculptures, "found
abandoned on a side street in Philadelphia on a trash night in
1982." The cover bears a photo of one such sculpture, and photos
of three follow DuPlessis' draft...

not that I see any reason to abandon the term Pomo despite its semantic
overlap, but Alan Sondheim's counterexample of the word "turkey" reminds
me that, in Japanese, "Turkish" (Turuko) used to be the word for massage
parlor (in the 42nd St sense) but, after complaints from the Turkish
government, there was a universal name change and now such establishments
are known in Japanese as "Soapland" (sopurando).

This reminded me of a commercial they were running a couple of years ago for
some stupid piece of shit or other which featured two things that ostensibly
"didn't go well together":  poetry and power tools.  There was a guy
shouting his "poim" while drills, electric saws, etc. wailed away behind
him.  I thought they worked rather nicely together, actually.  It obviously
made a more effective impression in my mind than did the product;  I can't
even remember what it was anymore.

Thanks Chris St*rffolino:
Wld love to lay claim to the logopoeia/Loy claim; in fact it was Carolyn
Burke who made the argument and she's RIGHT ("Getting Spliced," AMERICAN
QUARTERLY, that's all I can supply... is the person who was looking for
CB still looking? pls backchannel).
 
It doesn't take such an extra-ordinary critic to restore names to
lit history.  I say matches to all the strawmen of modernism. Lit history...
 
Look forward to the, um, use of Greenberg in David Lehman's forthcoming
opus on the NY School.
 
bye for now-- Marisa

Subject:      Re: Pomo
 
why not ask a Pomo Indian how e feels about the word being used to abbreviate
postmodern?  there's a lot of defensive wheelspinning and theoretical
bristling at the suggestion that we be mindful of multiple meanings, some of
which are the only fragments of tragic history remaining to us.  If there
were a similar word "Juden" being used in Germany to designate some
theoretical humanistic position or aesthetic, you better believe i'd be
beside myself with rage, and no fancy self-protective intellectualizing by
the sons and daughters of the victors would convince me not to be.  why is it
so hard to see mark's and joe's point?

>>anybody know of any ties between poetry and sculpture lately?
 
Jordan, At the Scottsdale Center for the Arts Poetry Series, now in its
ninth season, we regularly schedule (usually 3x/season) programs in which we
commission poets and writers to create original texts in response to
sculptural or other visual work.  Central Park (in Issue 15, I believe)
printed a piece called "6 X 6" that was a collaborative performance poem
Beverly Carver and I wrote for one of those performances.

Well, I was surprised and dismayed upon moving down here to Texas,
that there *are* still people who use "jew" as a verb.
 
But I'm not sure that the "Pomo" situation is a parallel -- do any of
the list members in English feel that way about the term "english"
wrt tennis ball spin?

I browsed around your website just now, and am EXTREMELY interested in
purchasing Lyn Hejinian's book, "Writing is an Aid to Memory." HOwever,
the ordering service at your website was inacessible, at least from my
terminal. Could you please let me know what I need to do to purchase it.
Could I have it mailed to me, and pay for it by check or credit card? I
wish I could order it from a bookstore, but I attend school in a small
California town, and the one bookstore in town is ostensibly unable to
order from Sun & Moon. (I checked on ordering Sun & Moon book once
before) Please get back to me when you can, and thank you for releasing
info. on your website.

Re your:  "Hearing his reading of the work gave me a new sense of his
use of line break and space --  not sure I can explain it, but I think
I had been reading over the line breaks too quickly before"
 
It takes some remembering, but I think it's probably easy to see those
clusters of words about the page in such a way as to interpret them as
airy, even wispy, and I think that's an error a lot of people do make
in reading Eigner. The minute one realizes how fully he utilized his
limited physical vocabularly in order simply to put word to page, the
whole weight of movement shifts, and those poems never have that
"light" feeling again. I cannot fathom exactly how strangers will read
that work a century from now, but I assume it will be rather different.

It is very nice to hear about Sun & Moon's website, and I want to announce
that a Chax Press website has been open for a few weeks now, although I
consider it still very much in progress. It includes information on both the
trade literary books and handmade editions from Chax, and has at present
just a few links to other sites for poetry and book arts. It has an
announcement of new books, a list of all books, a review essay reprinted
from TapRoot Reviews, and a bit more. Within a few days it will have images
of a few of the handmade, limited edition books from Chax, and an essay on
the book arts. And of course it will be continually developing. More
informational than sales-oriented, and there is at this time no on-line
ordering service. The URL for the site is
 
http://www.bookarts.org/chax/
 
 
Also, books announced a couple of months ago here as forthcoming are now
available:
 
Mary Margaret Sloan, The Said Lands, Islands, and Premises   $11
 
Myung Mi Kim, The Bounty   $12

The ground between traveling and home
not a walk across fields

Jordan et al--
 
Glad you asked--a friend of mine, Joan Levinson, has a show running now
(through Feb 10, alas--Sat.) at the Nicholas Davies & Co. gallery, 23
Commerce St (b/t 7th Ave S and Bedford).  She makes sculpture with found
objects, w/ accompanying text.  Texts are gnomic and delightful-- a
poetic prose coming, in some ways, from Stein.  I hope you get a chance
to stop in--let me know if you do.

Dear Ron and others,
 
I never had the privilege of meeting Eigner or hearing him read. I want to
thank you all for posting your remembrances.  This is a moment when the
POETICS list becomes a real community.
 
I'm wondering: Could we generate a bibliography of video and audio
recordings of Eigner, and where they're available, that might be housed at
the EPC?  If it's true that Eigner will be features on USOP, great; but
there must be other recordings at SFSU and elsewhere, no?
 
Speaking for myself, as one who came "from" MFA-establishment poetics
and who is slowly learning the fullness of what's available, I would find
such a list of enormous personal value.
 
Cheers,
David

About the website: the order form does come up, but it's a bit confusing;
I've suggested
that the entire order form appear at the front of the "call-up" by name or
some such method.
We're still ironing out the site.

A couple of things come to mind--Ian Hamilton Finlay's Stonypath garden
in Scotland (Finlay fought the scottish gov. for a tax exemption for one
of the poem-sculptures on his land, which he argued was a religious edifice
and hence exempt from taxes--he lost.  Michael Archer writes about it in
_Artforum_ 30, Nov 91).
 
The city of Toronto dedicated the back alley behind Coach House Press to
bpNichol after his death.  There is a Nichol poem literally embedded in
the concrete floor of bpNichol Lane---"a line / alone / a lane . . . "
 
Last year Artspeak gallery in Vancouver presented a show on the book as
object.  I showed a hardcover book that was bolted closed with a found poem
laminated on to the cover:  "to write a book and revoke it is
something else than not writing it at all . . . to write a book that
does not claim importance for anybody is something else than leaving
it unwritten."

DAILY / MEANS: A SELECTION OF POEMS (or: SELECTED POEMS.  27 poems are
included, and the recording data (circumstances) read as follows: Recorded

There are several figures in the artworld who come to mind here as well -
Lawrence Weiner and Jenny Holzer - her Lustmord two years ago in Soho was
nothing short of amazing, as was her use of Times Square movie marquees.
Both took my breath away. I think she has the most astute approach to
virtual language and its material productions of anyone I can think of.
 
(One might also add the works of people like On Kawara and Arakawa here,
as well as some of the object-like qualities of Dieter Rot's books and
other productions.)

David -
 
Yes there is a tape of Larry Eigner reading at the Poetry Center at SFSU -
It is from November 29, 1984 and is the reading Larry did for co-winning
the Poetry Center Book Award in 1983 for Water/Places/A Time. He read with
Tina Darragh.
 
I also want to mention that the initial version of the web site for the
Poetry Center and American Poetry Archives is up at
www.sfsu.edu/~newlit/welcome.htm.It has our current reading schedule plus
some basic information about the Archives.

OBITUARY --  Lawrence Joel Eigner
Stephen Schwartz
 
A funeral will be held tomorrow for Lawrence Joel (Larry) Eigner, a
leading American modernist poet, who died of pneumonia Saturday at Alta
Bates Hospital in Berkeley. He was 68.
 
Mr. Eigner was born in Swampscott, Mass., and suffered a birth injury
that left him non-ambulatory with cerebral palsy throughout his life.
He was educated at home and took correspondence courses with the
University of Chicago.
 
In 1949, Mr. Eigner first heard the poet and editor Cid Corman reading
William Butler Yeats on the radio and began a correspondence with him
that brought Mr. Eigner's work to the attention of the poetry scene of
the time. ``The ice broke considerably,'' Mr. Eigner noted modestly.
 
Mr. Eigner became associated with the ``Black Mountain poets,'' a group
that included the late Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, Robert Creeley,
and Denise Levertov. These writers published in Black Mountain Review,
printed at Black Mountain College, a small experimental institution in
North Carolina, and in Corman's magazine, Origin.
 
``From the Sustaining Air,'' Mr. Eigner's first mature book of poems,
was issued by Creeley's Divers Press in 1953. The author was praised by
the poet William Carlos Williams for his ``perfect ear,'' and as a
``new and outstanding writer.'' Williams commented of that book, ``It's
strange how old fashioned he makes much of the work of the past
appear.''
 
Mr. Eigner's work was included in the landmark anthology, ``The New
American Poetry,'' published in 1960 by Donald M. Allen. Mr. Eigner
went on to publish numerous other books, including ``Selected Poems,''
in 1972, edited by Samuel Charters and Andrea Wyatt, and ``Areas Lights
Heights, Selected Writings 1954-1989,'' edited by Benjamin Friedlander
and printed in 1989.
 
In 1983 the San Francisco State University Poetry Prize was awarded to
Mr. Eigner for ``Waters/Places/A Time,'' edited by Robert Grenier.
 
A 1986 anthology of language poetry, ``In the American Tree,'' edited
by Ronald Silliman, was dedicated to Mr. Eigner.
 
He was the subject of a 1973 film with Allen Ginsberg, ``Getting It
Together.''
 
Mr. Eigner is survived by his brothers Richard, of Berkeley, and
Joseph, of St. Louis.
 
A funeral will be held at 2 p.m. tomorrow at Rolling Hills Memorial
Park (Tel Shalom section) near the Interstate 80 intersection with
Hilltop Drive in Richmond.
 
Memorial contributions are requested for KPFA-FM, 1929 Martin Luther
King Jr. Way, Berkeley 94704.

I seem to remember the Berkeley organizers videotaping the Eigner tribute
readings (but maybe I just remember seeing Kush there) -- perhaps someone
from among the readers will recall, since they all were busied with the
signing of varied forms prior to the affair.  I made a good audio tape of
the readings for the radio program I operated in those days, but of
course the tape is in San Jose and I am in L.A. -- Once I retireve the
tape (perhaps late Spring), I'd be hap[py to put a copy on deposit at the
Buffalo collection.  Since I had permission for the radio taping, I think
it's O.K. to deposit the tape as a record of that event, though
circulation beyond that would require further permissions from the U.C.
Berkeley organizers.  Point is, that marathon session of tribute readings
followed by Eigner himself was preserved.

thank you so much, jack, for pointing out in a very immediate and timely way
that Pomos are not to be facilely compared to the Greeks, Romans, Turks or
English, who were imperialists and colonizers.  With all due respect to
language-supremacists, let's get real for a minute, and not indulge our
philosophies glibly at the expense of impoverished "children under two,"
whether or not they have, in our grandiose opinions, "subject positions."

Subject: larry eigner
 
Dear Charles,
 
Thank you for your touching, eloquent remarks about Larry.  As you suggested,
I'll email my press release and also fax it to you.
 
I've been so busy, partly with trying to spread the news about Larry and
partly with other things (had to record radio interviews with Adrienne Rich
and Jerry Rothenberg), that I've been barely able to put my thoughts
together.  Larry had been in the hospital for a week before his death,
comatose.  This morning, quite early, both Michael McClure and my son Sean
phoned me to tell me they'd heard of Larry's death and funeral arrangements
on NPR.  That was exactly the kind of thing Larry would do--phone me at an
hour when no one else would phone me to tell about something he'd heard on
the radio.  He's been my friend for ten years--I'd see him once a week and
hear from him on the phone quite often.  Our birthdays were two days
apart--we had a joint party once.  He wrote a preface to my first book,
LETTERS/LIGHTS--WORDS FOR ADELLE, the only preface he wrote to anyone's book.
(Except for the few remarks he made at the beginning of Ron Silliman's CROW.
I had asked Larry for a blurb.  He responded with a preface.)  My current
book, EXILES, was at his bedside during the last conscious week of his life.
His voice on a message machine was something to hear.  He once left a
message on Michael McClure's machine.  Michael couldn't make heads nor tails
of it, but I was able to catch what Larry was saying.   Larry was not easy to
be friends with.  The pattern tended to be for people to visit him for a
while, make some effort to understand his speech, and then to drift away.  I
was able to stay friends partly because I didn't live with him and partly
because I understood his speech as well as anyone.  This was more something I
willed than something I learned.  I was running a poetry series in Berkeley
and I admired Larry's work and wanted him to read in the series.  Barry
Watten gave me Larry's phone number, not his address, only his phone number.
 I've never known whether this was some sort of joke on Barry's part, since
he certainly had his address as well as his phone number.  I phoned and Larry
answered, saying something like "UNGHHHHH."  I had known that Larry was
disabled but hadn't realized until that moment that the disability extended
to his speech.  I simply decided I would understand Larry.  There is no other
way to put it.  By the time the conversation was over, Larry had given me his
address and directions to his house, and we had agreed on a date when he was
to read.  Kathleen Frumkin told me later that she had been listening on an
extension phone and had been ready to help me out if I needed it.  She never
said anything because I seemed to be managing.  You write, "His will to think
was unsuppressible."  Yes, but so was his will to speak--to speak in any
manner he could.  You've been with Larry and know how he would talk all the
time.   "To break out with a man's cry," if I'm quoting correctly.  His
writing, with all its silences, necessarily partook of that urge towards
talk.  People complained of it--Bob and others accused him of "monologuing."
Yet there it was, at his very center, controlled in certain ways but in
others not.   Hard to think of him silent.
 
Here is the piece I wrote at the request of the Eigner family:
 
LARRY EIGNER: 1927-1996
 
     Distinguished American poet and writer Lawrence Joel (Larry) Eigner died
Saturday February 3rd of pneumonia at Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley.
Eigner was 68 and is survived by two brothers, Richard, who lives in
Berkeley, and Joseph, who lives in Saint Louis, Missouri.
 
     Born August 7, 1927, in Swampscott, Massachusetts, on the North Shore of
Boston, Eigner got cerebral palsy as a result of a birth injury.  Though he
remained "non-ambulatory" throughout his life, he recalled that his mother,
Bessie Eigner, encouraged him to develop a "work ethic," and his schooling
was conducted at home through Swampscott High School.  Later, seven
correspondence courses from the University of Chicago gave him "a toe-hold of
application and hope."  Curiosity, he claimed, was always an important
factor, "my eyes still big for my head, most things...always tantalizing
beyond or almost beyond sight and hearing, out of reach."
 
     In 1949 Eigner "bumped into [poet] Cid Corman reading Yeats, on the
radio" and wrote a letter disagreeing with Corman's non-declamatory way of
reciting.  "This began a correspondence in which I got introduced to things,
and the ice broke considerably."  Donald Allen's landmark 1960 anthology, THE
NEW AMERICAN POETRY, includes Eigner's exquisite, often enigmatic verse in
the section devoted to "The Black Mountain Poets," a group of writers
publishing in THE BLACK MOUNTAIN REVIEW, an experimental magazine printed by
Black Mountain College in North Carolina.  Many of these poets had also
appeared in Corman's magazine, ORIGIN.  Among the poets associated with this
group were Charles Olson, Robert Duncan, Denise Levertov, and Robert Creeley,
whose Divers Press published Eigner's first mature book, FROM  THE SUSTAINING
AIR, in 1953.  After reading that book, William Carlos Williams remarked on
Eigner's "perfect ear" and added, "It's strange how oldfashioned he makes
much of the work of the past appear.  But it is always so with every new and
outstanding writer."
 
     Eigner's many books, all of them published through small presses,
include: ON MY EYES (1960, edited by Denise Levertov); ANOTHER TIME IN
FRAGMENTS (1967); SELECTED POEMS (1972, edited by Samuel Charters and Andrea
Wyatt); THINGS STIRRING TOGETHER OR FAR AWAY (1974); COUNTRY / HARBOR / QUIET
/ ACT / AROUND (1978, selected prose edited by Barrett Watten), and WATERS /
PLACES / A TIME (edited by Robert Grenier, the book was co-winner of the San
Francisco State Poetry Award in 1983).  AREAS LIGHTS HEIGHTS, SELECTED
WRITINGS 1954-1989, edited by Benjamin Friedlander, appeared from Roof Books
in 1989.  Eigner's current book of poetry, again edited by Grenier, WINDOWS
WALLS YARD WAYS, appeared in 1994 from Black Sparrow Press, publisher of many
of his titles.  Another volume of poetry edited by Grenier, READINESS /
ENOUGH / DEPENDS / ON, is forthcoming from Sun & Moon Press.  In 1967 Toad
Press published a second, expanded edition of FROM THE SUSTAINING AIR, and
in 1988 The Coincidence Press reprinted the original edition.  Ron Silliman's
1986 anthology of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry, IN THE AMERICAN TREE, was dedicated
to Larry Eigner.  A short "Autobiography" is forthcoming from Gale Research,
Inc. in Detroit.  In Eigner's poems, themes of ecology and explorations of
his Jewish heritage exist side by side with the most advanced experimental
techniques and deep, deceptively simple, sensuous evocations of the world
around him.  "Parodying Socrates a little," he wrote, "you might say I know
enough to feel naive."
 
     In August, 1978, a few months after his father's death, Eigner relocated
to Berkeley, CA, where his brother Richard was residing and where he lived
till his death.  Many young poets visited him there, and he carried on an
active correspondence with poets throughout the world.  The door to his home
was frequently unlocked.  As a regular at Jack Foley's Larry Blake's reading
series in Berkeley, Eigner became a familiar figure to the Bay Area poetry
scene.  Despite the difficulty many people had in understanding his speech,
he gave many readings of his poetry, often in the company of Foley.
 
     Eigner was also something of a media figure.  In 1973, Leonard Henny and
Jan Boon made GETTING IT TOGETHER, a documentary film about Eigner with
poetry readings by Allen Ginsberg.  In August, 1994, Foley broadcast an
hour-long interview with Eigner on KPFA radio.  THE UNITED STATES OF POETRY,
 a forthcoming series made for public television by Bob Holman, has a segment
featuring Eigner.  In the summer of 1993, at the suggestion of Berkeley poet
Lyn Hejinian, the UC Berkeley University Art Museum paid tribute to Eigner
with a special MATRIX exhibition.  His poem, "again dawn," from ANOTHER TIME
IN FRAGMENTS, was inscribed on the building's facade.  A special poetry
reading at which Eigner appeared was held to commemorate the event.  Eigner's
last public appearance was at a tribute to Gertrude Stein which Hejinian
presented at New College of California in November, 1995.
 
     Eigner's innovative poetry was widely admired by poets of very different
persuasions.  The poets to whom he returned again and again were Hart Crane,
William Carlos Williams, and Charles Olson.  Denise Levertov wrote, "More
than almost any poet I can think of, he demands a suppleness, an imaginative
agility, a willingness and ability to leap with him from image to image...."
 Robert Duncan asserted that Eigner had produced "a new development of
Williams's line: his phrasings are not broken off in an abrupt juncture but
hover, having a margin of their own--stanzaic phrasings--suspended in their

birth to the last ten elegies, in the Duino series, after a 10 year spell
of (Duino) muselessness.

Pat and the list - sorry for the lack of info - presumptuous to think that
everyone knows - Canessa Park Reading and Talk Series is a reading series in
San Francisco mostly devoted to "experimental" poetry. The location is 708
Montgomery St. in an art gallery/architectural firm. The usual pattern is
Sunday afternoon at 3:00, but the second reading of March is on a Saturday,
because of a conflict with another reading. My husband (Jordon Zorker) and I
have curated the series for a couple of years, sometimes with the help of
other poets/writers. We serve tea and cookies and the admission price just
went up to $5.OO. Usually two readers perform for about half an hour each. I
have heard some of the best poetry and writing in the country in the years
that the series has been around (more than 10, but not sure how long really.)
Laura Moriarity and Spencer Selby did the series before me and Jordon. Now
you have more information than you probably ever wanted!

(especially to Joe Amato, but all else, too)
 
Pretty sure I'll sound like a real dickwad for saying some of the stuff I
want to on this continually intriguing subject, especially after Jack's
very pertinent 'real world' update and its enormous popularity.
 
But anyway.
 
It occurs to me that Wittgenstein may be pertinent to this whole
discussion of the 'pomo/Pomo' issue ( and I credit Marjorie for
indirectly illuminating my ideas here). Witt. has the basic idea that the
operations of language can be seen as relatively concrete--or perhaps I
should say discrete--when examined in the particular contexts or, shall we
say, communities in which the occur.  While some thinking floating around
now seems typically to relate this idea to literary language and poetics
(or in any case that seems to be Marjorie's interest), it occurred to me
while all this was being dicussed that Witt's. ideas may have some
relevance to 'the social' or 'material culture' or what have you.  In
*this* particular language community, the term pomo was evidently at some
point instantiated as a useful and shall we say fully referential term
among its users (though the stability of the referent itself is obviously
in dispute and should be).  In a newspaper article or more explicitly
social/public community of language, the term Pomo clearly does mean
something else, enjoys some pretty solid referentiality, etc.--it
'means.' So what I'm thinking is that if a member of the P{omo social
group happened upon this language community s/he (or ze, or e, etc.)
would probably catch on pretty quick, to the extent that s/he would
understand that a different 'language game,' to use Witt's own term, was
operating--though I wouldn't necessarily argue that s/he still wouldn't
be affected by this alternative usage, I do think it likely s/he would
understand it as a *different* one.  And all this may point to a way that
in some way marxism and critical perspectives like it (institution-study,
structure-study) may not be the only avenues of discussion.
        And of course I'm only refering to academic or more likely pseudo-
academic modes of thinking, but they're the ones I'm stuck in at the moment.
        I should emphasize that the things I'm saying aren't really meant
to comment on the very real and pressing problems of the Pomo group, only
that there are a lot of different ways for discussion to continue.
        And with all those disclaimers, I probably still sound like an
insensitive jerk, but I'll let that risk stand for now.
 
Thanks, Ryan

this kind of comment tends to get me to thinking:  it's very reductive and
very incorrect.  To state the obvious, the majority of English, Greeks and
Turks were not imperialists or colonizers, they were normal people, and quite
a few of them oppressed, below the poverty line, disenfranchised, etc. and
yet still English, Greek or Turkish.  Do you see what I'm saying?  All too
quickly we blame an entire people or race or gender for something done by a
minority within the group.  This seems so obvious to me that I have an eerie
feeling I'm missing the entire point, you know?

Dear Eryque,
 
I guess I was just looking for any excuse to spread that info. accross
the e-waves, or any place for that matter, particularly Rilke bit, as I
have been re-reading Rilke's elegies lately, and also I have this Book of
Days for the Literary Year and turning to it this week I discovered that
tomorrow's the day was the day, is the day, will be the day for the final
break-out of the Duino flood. AH!

While I see Maria's (and others) point, I also see Ryan's.  But what really
frustrates me about this discussion is that it's couched entirely in
impractical space.  Bringing out, it seems, the pompous intellectual in all
of us.  Who among ye has contacted Jim Brown (thanks to Jack for the
address) and offered tangible support (powdered milk, pampers,
what-have-you) to the Pomos?  A people in lack of these is is probably not
in the luxurious frame of mind necessary to sitting around arguing/caring
that their phonemes refer to something else in a different context.  While
examining (and perhaps even changing) our use of language is important, it
doesn't absolve us of deeper obligations.  Put your money where there mouths

Subject:      pomo/Pomo etc...
 
ryan, i think i understand your use of wittgenstein, and find value in
considering his remarks re language games... though i have to say that
wittgenstein's stance in _phil invest_ is pretty fuzzy in many ways (i see
the latter text primarily as a heuristic)... still it's possible that a
pomo native would enter this list and not know what in hell we're talking
about... sometimes *i* don't know what in hell we're talking about... and
of the 375 subscribers here, it's a fair wager that a number never heard
pomo used with *either* denotation...
 
and may i remind folks that there may be something like 1000 pomo natives
(from what i've been able to ascertain), and that there may be something
like a few thousand, if that many, folks on this planet who regularly use
pomo as an abbrev. postmodern... so that the various poets and scholars and
publishers on this list *could* make a very real difference, usage-wise...
 
(if i may) the problem is not philosophical... or, i'm choosing not to
theorize it according to the dictates/nuances of that discipline, or of
wittgenstein for that matter... there are times i long for a spiritual
response to matters material, and vice versa... here it seems to me that
what some of us have been asking for is some recognition of the possible
material as well as spiritual damage in coining new terms, uhm,
helter-skelter... that is, that we try to be as generous as possible in
working out our semantic/pragmatic fields, the field of possibilities that
we refer to as "discourse"...
 
i mean, for me, generosity is a privilege, presumes certain
responsibilities (recall that elite/elitist thread)... means we have to
listen, closely... so, and not to sound in the least oracular about it, how
to listen?...
 
also, and i s'pose this is in response to james perez's post, it's one
thing to observe that there are "normal" greek, american, or turkish folks
and quite another to suggest that the greek, american, or turkish
governments have acted or continue to act in imperialist ways... one of the
more obvious abuses of national 'sovereignity' of which i'm aware is the
current greek-turkish dispute, underwrit as i see it by turkey's continued
genocide of the kurds... it seems to me that turkey has been consistently
in the wrong here, both wrt to the greeks, the kurds, and the cypriots...
and consistently backed by *US* here in the u.s. (formally now) b/c of
turkey's proximity to the middle east (incl. of course iraq)... and i see
no harm in calling everybody's attention to turkish/u.s. hegemonies in this
regard... though of course this ain't what i normally do here on poetics,
so apologies for this wee bit of politicking...
 
best,

Roof published Eigner's essays, edited by Ben Friedlander, in 1989. I

and sell it for $10 including postage from:
Segue Foundation

I was always amazed at how a person with such vitality of mind could
tolerate such a physical situation. Larry must have had unimaginable
control of himself to withstand the intensity of his thoughts. Eigner's
writing invokes an inner life without trivializing it, a life of
the mind without relying on it, and continuing optimism in the face of
human fragility. He ended "Responsibility is to keep the ability to
respond" with a poem about his uncle:
 
                        the typewriter

The discussion on LANGUAGE poets and the quotidian began when someone on the
list reported having been challenged to show that LANGUAGE writers have
addressed the quotidian.  While I am not hostile to LANGUAGE poetry, and count
some poets associated with it among my personal favorites, I do have a similar
question.  I wonder about erotics.  Assuming Leslie Scalapino is not
considered a LANGUAGE poet -- and I don't see her as so in any narrow sense --
have any so-called LANGUAGE poets worked with the erotic?  Do the suppositions
of most LANGUAGE poetry, summarized by Douglas Messerli in his introduction to
LANGUAGE POETRIES (New Directions),  make eroticism a difficult area of life
to address?  Does the seeming lack of eroticism point to a limitation in the
LANGUAGE project?
 
I'm asking these questions in a friendly spirit simply because I am curious.
 
Best,

Of course there are such folks.  & I can't say I agree with their idea of
"help" or activism, but I'm not sure that what they're doing isn't more
useful---in the short term---than merely examining the language.  The fact
that "pomo" also denotes postmodernism won't mean much if Pomos aren't
around to know it.  Having long been involved in both academics & activism,
I've become increasingly bothered by my observation that they rarely seem to
meet at a point conducive to practical action...so the Pomo discussion, esp.
considering how heated it was getting, triggered an ancient angst.  Just a
little wary of impotent paternalism...clean hands at the keyboard &
elsewhere.  The folks you envision would seem to be the lesser of 2 evils.
To me. Where priorities & immediacies are concerned.

Well, "Language Poets" sometimes seem easiest to define as those sprigs who
shot from Getrude Stein rather than T. S. Eliot or Ezra Pound. Now who's
the most erotic of those three grannies?
 
Carla Harryman & Lyn Hejinian's ongoing collaboration is the stuff of
laughing orgasms. Ron Silliman's "Sunset Debris" is better than any of the
Super-8 Triple-X I've seen. Gracious heavens, I even find Susan Howe's work
erotic in a way (fingertips carefully positioning the physical to achieve
maximal emotional weight) -- but my libido is probably not yours.

Hello everyone
 
and sorry to go on a fishing expedition in the middle of such engrossing
threads
 
does anyone happen to know any background information/good stories about that
insanely great picture of William Carlos Williams on the cover of the New
Directions _Selected_? you know the one-- where he appears to be grinning
from the heart of a flowering tree, unselfconsciously.
 
i just got a very smart essay by an MA student on Williams and pastoral,
and it got me wondering if there's anything on record anywhere about it.
 
Thanks!  With Enryque I vote "front channel" on any stein stuff, too.

There's a book called *A Primer for the Gradual Understanding of Gertrude
Stein*, by, I'm pretty sure, Gertrude Stein, in which she talks some about
revision in *Tender Buttons*. ("PEELED PENCIL, CHOKE" was originally a much
longer piece, etc.)  I skimmed it a couple of years ago & am not sure if it
addresses your other questions, but it might be worth taking a look at.
"How long it took" can probably be found somewhere in *Autobio of Alice B T*.

Subject:      Re: e=r=o=t=i=c
 
I'm trying to apply for a minature undergrad. grant to research the
subject of eroticism.  Applying a small piece of a Bernarnd Tschumi
manifesto, claiming "Border crossing is erotic" (he's an architect who
has prosed that perhaps all architecture, rather than being about
functional standards, is about love and death), I was hoping to trace an
erotic "border crossing" thru a modernist-postmod lineage.  I'm tempted to
tease out a kind of progression from heroic-erotic to semiotic-erotic
(ugh, probably too "sexy" terms), which fundamentally avoids
commidification as pornography. As well, describe how
eroticism became an exemplary mode of individualistic radicalism
(transgression) distraught and disillusioned w/ party-line collective
radicalism which tends to shun the body.
 
I'm probably over-speculating and hedging gender-specific implications,
as well as some "sex-specific" opportunities once suggested by Lyn Hejinian.
Somewhere (anyone know where?)
I've heard Barrett Watten suggested language writing is an example of
"new eroticism" which I'd like to debrief.  I also think there is a
somewhat painful eroticism in Bruce Andrews' work.  Ultimately, I want to
claim that eroticism (or "new eroticism"--one not literal but still
predicated on border crossing) is a valid form of scholarship--alas,
another methodology!
 
If any one knows of good sources/theories/practices for this topic,
please post or let me know.  I'm approaching the prospects of obtaining
the grant rather grimly; the review board wants "original research" which
often means use test-tubes or public polls.
 
Any suggestions?  anways, carry on.

Just a quick response to Jeff Hansen's question about language writing
and erotics: I've just been reading Lyn Hejinian's and Carla Harryman's
collaborative work *The Wide Road* which would be a great place to
start.  It's published in excerpts in 0/4, Avec, and a few other
journals.  An introductory comment in the excerpt in 0/4 begins with
this statement: "Five years ago, in the course of a casual
conversation, we found ourselves agreeing that, because language is
active, anything in language could be erotically charged" And then
also, "In recent years, the generative possibilities of the erotic
imagination have been less often documented than the limitations of
the alterity involved."
 
*Wide Road* is quite playful and often hilarious, as well as, in my
opinion, incredibly interesting. It's written from the first person plural
point of view--the work explores subjectivity and shared imagination and
the erotic implications and freedoms that come with, in language, as
language.

I agree with this point and have already jotted the address/info. about
helping out, as soon as I scrape cash together; my point would simply
be--and this is to some extent implied by emily's--that both this
ostensibly encapsulated space of discourse and the real world of action

these being variously scripts, poems in play form, film

(contestant no. 2, unable to slam the buzzer: Who is Charles Bernstein?
versifying the beginning of one of his essays/seminars/conversations ...)
 
(contestant no. 3, way behind in points: Who is Carla Harryman? sputtering

This, I also suspect to be the case, and it is precisely part of the
point I was trying to make. I'd gathered that this whole issue began as a
tangent on the problems that derive from language games or spaces of
discourse getting blurred, and it seems to have become one in which
issues of language and issues of social responsibility are getting
blurred--not that they're ever all that distinct, just that two different
things have been talked about, to me, as more similar than they are. On
the other hand, they're not mutually exclusive subjects by any means, as
others have noted; likewise, discussing this/these topics in the manner
we have hardly precludes other modes of social activity, and can by no
means by reduced to inflated academic jargonizing, as others have not noted.

Okay, I'm *really* obviously just an insenstitive ass, I guess: the
difference you mention is one that doen't need to be made, because a
discrete difference in usage is already instantiated and understood.
Though I have to say the concept of a few thousand poets and poeticists
become some body of activists via email is without question intriguing.

And why are you making that choice? Aren't *all* problems philosophical?
Is what you're calling "philosophical" discussion necessarily
theoretical? I was actually convinced I'd stumbled upon something kind of
practical.

I wholeheartedly agree, but I do not think that generosity is one of the
foremst qualities of language, it's a human thing and making choices
doesn't necessarily mean controlling consequences, on either side of the
ball, don't you think. Makes me think of some tale I heard a few uears
agoabout computers being described (in terms of compatibility) in sexual
terms, the most common being androgenous> (Pardon the odd tangent.)

And how to speak; both activities seem to me to be largely determined by
systems or habits of both liberty (generosity?) and constraint
(selfishness?).
 
Sorry if some of this sounds kind of crabby, just that I'm tired and just
saw _Dead Man Walking_ tonight which is a pretty much okay movie, nothing
astounding really except Penn but worth seeing for his work and more, but
anyway the point at this point is that it's a helluva good movie for
making you morose, depressed, or however else the nausea of morailty,
personal and collective, may affect you.

Stacy Doris' _Kildare_ from Roof is pretty hot. Andy Levy's _Curve_,

second on Coolidge's _Mesh_. Mr Stroffolino & Lee Ann Brown. Bernadette!
Also, re Carla Hejinian & Lyn Harryman (they become interchangeable in this
piece) -- "The Wide Road" --  20 pages are to be found in _Aerial 5_, there's
also some in _Resurgent: New Writing by Women_ ed. Robinson & Norton (U.
Illonois Press), & some in George & Chris Tysh's magazine _Everyday Life_. Of
course we're considering sexuality as explicit subject matter, rather than as
a given, which seems to me most accurate.

Geez, Jeff,
 
I think there's lots of eroticism in most all of my langpo friends.
Carla Harryman and Lyn Hejinian's collaboration The Wide Road would be
an obvious place to start, but Bob Perelman's early 11 Romantic
Positions wouldn't be bad either (tho it's a more fugitive work). I've
been criticized for having _too much_ in my own writing. So your
question puzzles me.
 
As to Leslie being a langpo or no, this is precisely where labels prove
to be so foolish. At the time I was editing In the American Tree the
fact that she was not (then) publishing in the same venues and that her
work, to the degree that it shared similar concerns, struck me as an
intense, if friendly, critique (much the same way I read Ted Pearson or
Bev Dahlen or Jerry Estrin at the time, and really how I read many of
the New Coast writers today). But over time critique becomes a form of
involvement and boundaries blur considerably. That's why it makes more
sense to call it a moment rather than a movement. Leslie's a brilliant
writer, which is what matters.

Maria,
 
What an amazing coincidence that you mention Elizabeth Smart, as she is the
covergirl for this month's issue of Mirage #4/Period[ical], the zine that
Kevin and I edit here in San Francisco.
 
A few years ago I was star-struck by Smart's legend, having read the
passage in the Kenneth Rexroth biography by Linda Hamalian where Rexroth
discovers Smart picnicing lavishly in San Francisco's Union Square, only to
realize that she was homeless and pulling off a "Holly Golightly."  Also, I
was captivated by her romantic extravagance as delineated in the Smart
biography by Rosemary Sullivan, how she read one of George Barker's poems
in a bookstore and instantly fell head over heels in love with him--and
subsequently arranged for him and his wife to come to Canada so she could
begin her long-term, on and off, tormented affair with him.  (Djuna Barnes
was also in love with Barker--he must have been a really hot number--see
the Philip Herring life of Djuna Barnes).
 
Although little known in the US, she is a guilty pleasure in Canada.  When
I was still flushed with reading all about Smart, but still hadn't located
any of her writing, I happened to take a trip to Vancouver, where I was
yacking about her non-stop.  To my surprise, the women poets there did not
share my enthusiasm, saw Smart as a bit of an embarassment--someone their
mothers read.  One of them gave me a battered paperback copy of _By Grand
Central Station I Sat Down and Wept_ (1945).  (And I feel like the most
ungrateful person in the world, not being able to remember who gave me the
book--Lisa, Catriona, Deanna, I love you all.)
 
So, when I go home, I immediately crawled into bed with _Grand Central
Station_, expecting the read of my life.  But what a shock was in store for
me!  Excess and self-indulgence are things I've never turned up my nose at,
but in Smart's poetic novel, the mythologizing self is so large, not only
is there hardly any room for the reader to enter it, but there certainly
isn't any room for the plot.  It's like trying to fight your way through a
room crammed to capacity with helium balloons.  Smart's book is certainly
fascinating, but anybody who can get all the way through it should be given
a medal.
 
But I definitely am glad she's there for us.  I think it's totally
appropriate to include her in a list with Bataille.  We North American
folks need our own Laure.

This is Dodie Bellamy speaking (director of Small Press Traffic).
 
Now that most of the reviews for the March issue of the Small Press Traffic
newsletter are in, and we are about to go into full-speed production, it
seems time to begin gathering reviews for our May/June newsletter.  This
second newsletter will feature Hard Press, Kelsey St. Press, and O Books.
We are seeking brief (200-300 word) reviews of books published by these
presses.  Due to space limitations, we will only be able to review 6 to 8
books per press.   A list of books available to review follows.  Please
contact me if you are interested in reviewing any of these books (indicate
if you need a review copy and give me your mailing address).  Even if you
don't need a review copy, please give me your mailing address so that I can
send you copies of the newsletter.
 
Small Press Traffic, by the way, will be moving into New College of
California in March.  We will be located in their newest building at 741
Valencia Street, in San Francisco.  We'll have an office there--and space
for our new literary resource center.  We'll also have use of New College
facilities to hold events.  Soon, I'll post more details about this new
chapter in our history.  Right now the only text I have on our latest
reincarnation is written in grant-eze, and I'll spare you that.
 
Thanks for all the support the people on this list have given Small Press

hi dodie, i came to eliizabeth smart just the other way around; at eighteen
(1973), i pulled it off a bookshelf in Shakespeare & CO, in Paris, intrigued
by the title.  when i read it i couldn't believe anybody had my number so
intimately.  i was blown away (don't forget i wuz 18).  tho i wouldn;t use
the terms then, i'd say she came closest to "writing the body" of anyone i
hve read before or since, except maybe genet.  i knew nothing of her life
story, or of her.  for years, no one could tell me anything about her.  then
when she was rediscovered by Canadian fem lit crit folks and subseuqntly
Grand Central was reprinted, i learned of this autobiographical element.  i
still love her use of language.  i teach it every year or two, and students
either love or hate it, but nowadays they get all caught up in the
biographical aspect of it.  i had one smart u-grad write a paper entitled
"narrative grandiosity in Grand Central Station..." --the paper wasn't as
great as the title/

I took a class last year, entitled "The Erotics of Reading;" a very
ecclectic and unusual mix of works; Balzac's "Sarrasine", Pauline Reage's
"The Story of O," Oscar Wilde's "Salome," "The Ego and The Id" by Freud,
Jeannette Winterson's "Written on the body," Foucault's "History of
Sexuality," Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera," and
"The Pleasure of the Text," by Roland Barthes. Hence, we studied
eroticism from a theoretical, historical perspective, examining the ways
in which sexuality has been repressed, or in Foucault's proposal,
actually inverted and re-arranged in order to be incorporated into
discourse and also the ways erotica has been represented in literature.
We also examined the ways in which language acts as a catalyst for erotic
expression. The erotic, though a nebulous term, was, I thought,
epitomized in Wilde's work, as both form and content expressed the
erotic; the lusciousness of the language and the erotica of the content.
Other erotic literature that comes to mind: Whitman's "Song of Myself,"
Kate Chopin's "The Awakening," which were, by the way compared in an
essay by Harold Bloom, and to go way back: many of SAPPHO'S poems, and
one of my favorites THE SONG OF SONGS in the Old Testament, or The
Greatest of Songs, as the actual translation goes.

Maria,
 
I've been thinking a lot about this concept "writing the body."  What do
you mean when you use it in terms of Elizabeth Smart?
 
Also, do you know the origins of the concept "writing the body"--like who
originally coined the phrase?
 
Thanks.

Dear Ray, to me it's a toss-up, if "toss-up" can be applied to three
choices.  But T S Eliot is the Douglas Sirk of poetry.  See you!

This obituary appeared in THE NEW YORK TIMES this morning,
Sunday, February 11, 1996
 
 
LARRY EIGNER, 68, POET WHO SAW THE WORLD FROM HIS WEELCHAIR
 
By William Grimes
 
 
   Larry Eigner, whose spare, dense and impassioned poetry
carried on the tradition of William Carlos Williams, died
on Feb. 3, at Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley, Calif. He
was 68.
   The cause was complications from pneumonia, said Charles
Bernstein, a poet and professor of English at the State
University of New York at Buffalo.
   Mr. Eigner, who published under his nickname rather than
under his given name, Laurence, was born in Swampscott, Mass.,
near Boston. As a result of a birth injury, he developed
cerebral palsy, a condition that confined him to a wheelchair.
His disability had a profound influence on his poetry, which
often captured, in emotional bursts of language, fleeting
impressions received through the window of a house, an air-
plane or a car window.
    "It seems I feel the world as a neighborhood, or two
dozen miles of it, anyway," he once told an interviewer. "My
eyes are still big for my head; most things were always
beyond sight and hearing, out of reach."
    Mr. Eigner was educated at home and took correspondence
courses from the University of Chicago. In 1949, after hearing
the poet Cid Corman read Yeats on the radio, he started
writing to him. A correspondence developed, and Corman brought
Mr. Eigner's work to the attention of such poets as Robert
Duncan, Charles Olson, Denise Levertov and Robert Creeley, whose
work was published in Black Mountain Review and in Corman's mag-
azine, Origin.
    Mr. Eigner's first mature book of poetry, "From the Sustain-
ing Air," won the praise of Williams, but it was his inclusion
in the anthology "The New American Poetry" (1960) that carried
his name to a wider audience. His many works included "Another
Time in Fragments" (1967), "Things Stirring Together or Far
Away" (1974), "Waters/Places/A Time" (1981) and "Windows / Walls
Yard / Ways" (1964). His poetry and prose were collected in
"Selected Poems" (1972) and "Areas Lights Heights: Selected
Writings, 1954-1989" (1989).
    At the time of his death he had completed "readiness / enough /
depends / on," which Sun & Moon Press is to publish this summer.
    He is survived by two brothers, Richard, of Berkeley, and
Joseph, of St. Louis.
 
---------------------------------------------------
 
Finally, I'd thought I'd share one more poem. From a correspondence
with Larry in 1976, I found this poem in manuscript form:
 
 
                how much a squirrel is
                  in the road knocked dead
                 the same generations they
                    going around the wires
 
 
                               up the pole
                                        down the tree
 
 
                         not leaves
                                     call
                                           the
                                          patrol wagon
 
 
                                after how little blood
                                   from far away slow
 
 
                                  an action of your mind
                                     is to take your time
 
                                        when does the sun come out
                                         or it's dark   back in the woods
 
 
Larry wrote of his process accompanying this and other poems:
 
   "A reader of course can revise at will or imagine alternate versions,
how things might (or for all he now might have been) differently done.
It's a way into the piece on the page if he cant think of anything that
seems better or anyway as good and if he can the original writer might
agree, that it's better or as good. (Not the same of course
- when I have had two ways I've often solved the dilemma, avoided the
necessity of choice by coming up with a third (or 4th...?) thing
which seems preferable.) A couple of alterations editors (consciously
or unconsciously) or printers have made have seemed
at least as good, everything being al freco or ad-libbed, though many
more not so.
    "Ok I've thought for an audience during a reading to break in with some
questions say in the course of a piece, turning the poet's monologue into a
dialogue or conversation, it's saving things, the poem returning to its
communal source, intercourse (not to say language), sory of like DNA after
cell replication disbanded again from chromosomes and the genes spread out
in the nucleaus to modulate though maybe not regulate the cell."
 
 
"It's saving things, the poem returning to its communal source, intercourse...."
 
That's the heart of Larry Eigner's writing.

Looks like about ten books have accumulated on the nighttable -- so
here's the current reading list:
 
Robert Kelly, RED ACTIONS (Selected Poems 1960-1993) For anyone not
familiar with RK's work, this is one way in, though there is no way out
-- you'll have to go the other 50 books...
 
George Bataille, Michel Leiris, Marcel griaule, Carl Einstein, Robert
Desnos, etc. ENCYCLOPAEDIA ACEPHALICA (Atlas Archive Three: Documents of
the Avant-Garde) Another superb job by Alasteir Brotchie's Atlas press in
London. & now we need a reprint of ACEPHALE magazine itself.
 
Leonard Schwartz, etc., PRIMARY TROUBLE (Talisman House) Odd, if
engaging, assemblage. It doesn't as yet make a shape in my mind -- cld be
three hunter-gatherers bring back too eclectic an assortment of pray to
make for a coherent menu ( & for our special today we have buffalo
knuckle with toffu in an oyster-&-tamarind sauce) But I withhold
judgement until I have spent more time with the book.
 
Daniel Tiffany, RADIO CORPSE; Imagism and the cryptaesthetic of Ezra
Pound. (Harvard, 1995) The book's dedicated to norman O. Brown. Heavy
going, though if I get through the setup chapters (theorizing the notion
that images are not necessary visual) I'll most likely find sustenance in
the later parts, especially the RADIOACTIVITY chapter.
 
Salman Rushie, THE MOOR'S LAST SIGH -- yes, he can write & the book is a
treat!
 
Peter Osborne, THE POLITICS OF TIME: MODERNITY AND AVANT-GARDE (Verso
1995). That vexing old problem of calling a period in history "modern" --
what about time, history, etc. Lucid & well-written -- one of the more
pleasurable theory-reads of recent times.
 
ms. of first Cantos of Dante's INFERNO, translated by Armand Schwerner --
what an improvement! Pinsky, go home -- cld be that this will do to Dante
what Blackburn did to the Troubadours, i.e. make the poems readable again
as poems in american english.
 
Philippe Sollers, IMPROVISATIONS: an irritating intelligence gone to
seed, to waste. Interesting in post-hoc explanations of Tel Quel's coitus
interruptus with maoism.
 
Michael Joyce: OF TWO MINDS (Michigan UP) Excellent collection of essays
on hypertext, pedagogy & poetics -- the brightest thinking in an area
that has sofar not kept its promise.
 
Simon Pettet, SELECTED POEMS (Talisman House 1995) Wonderful. sweet,
sharp, witty, lyrical, a walk on the mild side...
 
TEACH YOURSELF WEB PUBLISHING IN A WEEK. Oh, well, it's been sitting
there for sedveral now, shld probably put it under the pillow & hope for
osmosis. Lemay is the clearest no-nonsense writer onm thes ematters, & if
I cld find the time & wld move the book to the desk & get that web-page
going.
 
Heiner Muller, ABC, (edizioni porce con le ali, 1996) translated by
Benjamin Friedlander. Thanks Ben, it's a beauty!
 
& then some mags (Private Arts 8/9; Park; Sulfur; West Coast Line; the
Po&sie issue on  Keats who turned 200 Oct 31, 1995; und so weiter und so
fort...

Subject:      Re: smart
 
hiya dodie, interesting, one of the last times i taught smart, in a course
called women and the literature of trauma (the course was itself a complete
trauma and i'll never do it again!), one woman loathed the book because she
thought it totally cerebral, disconnected...after class she burst into tears
and said it reminded her of her sister.  i asked if her sister was mentally
ill, and she said no, just disconnected.  funny, cuz for me, the book
captured perfectly my raging virginal hormones (at 18) that could only find
expression in intense fantasy, but that was more real to me than anything
going on with my actual friends, social life, etc.  I guess in the sense that
the body is an imagined landscape, smart fills it with myth and feeling.
i think "writing the body" comes from one of those early-ish french
feminists, cixous, kristeva, wittig or irigaray, but maybe not.
now please don't everyone jump down my throat for a) referring to the body as
an imagined landscape or b)listing all those french ladies in the same list
or c) referring to kristeva as a feminist.  it's too early in the morning.
thanks dodie, i love shooting the breeze w/ you about these matters.--xo,

Much of Steve McCaffery's poetry could be considered erotic (depending on
your definition of the word).  eg.  "Desire is not / a transitive verb." in
"Lyric's Larynx," or his writing through libidinal and general economies
eg.
"dasein not design, shhh as in soft through sound such as suck . . . " in
_The Black Debt_.

don't know about "Tender Buttons" specifically, but "Composition as
Explanation" (in the Selected Writings) and "How to Write" might be
helpful.  two books that have essays on Stein by other writers are
"Critical Essays on Gertrude Stein" edited by Michael J. Hoffman and
"Gertrude Stein Advanced: An Anthology of Criticism" edited by Richard
Kostelanetz.  "The Structure of Obscurity:  Gertrude Stein, Language, and
Cubism" by Randa Dubnick makes connections between Stein and painting.  I
haven't looked into any of these myself yet but will be doing some work
on Stein this summer and would be interested in talking with others about
her work.
 
hoping everything is swell,

Harryette Mullen
 
        KSW is honoured to host a reading by African-American poet and
critic Harryette Mullen, author of S*PeRM**K*T (Singing Horse Press), and
Trimmings (Tender Buttons) on Saturday, February 17th at 8:00 pm.
 
        "A form of address, as we are not just what we adorn,
        locates Harryette Mullen's ever more modulating etudes
         - a poetics of cultural markers, the rhythms that
         make us us, new beats in a promenade of innovating
        charms."
                                                        - Charles Bernstein
 
         Harryette Mullen's most recent work concerns the relationships between
poetry and identity, attempting to seek innovative language strategies to
help deal with what she calls 'competing literacies': the various
relationships of race to writing and its reception(s). Harryette Mullen has
taught at Cornell University and currently resides in Los Angeles,
California where she teaches African-American Literature  and Creative
Writing at UCLA.

Subject:      Amelia Rosselli
 
The poetry community has lost another major poet.
Amelia Rosselli, an Italian poet championed by
Pier Paolo Pasolini and many others, jumped to her
death from her apartment window in Rome on Saturday.
 
Daughter of a wartime hero and sister to the figure
portrayed in the movie, THE CONFORMIST, Amelia had had
mental health problems throughout her life, of which
she wrote intimately in her poetry.
 
Some of you will remember meeting her in New York
during THE DISAPPEARING PHEASANT festival at NYU
organized by Luigi Ballerini.
 
Below are a couple of her poems:
 
     The angels exit
     white and blue
     and I sit at the balcony
     black and white
 
     Crisis of bovarysm
     crisis of impoverishment!
     crisis of flowers
     crisis of workers
 
     Dialogue is done in four
     like a diagonal line
     I describe buses
     I start up again
     more prayers
     why are the trees blue?
 
     (Things themselves
     now my heart with light)
 
 
                 *
 
 
The spirit of the earth moves me
for a while; lying down or sitting I look
 
not at the watch; I touch it and
put it at the side of my head, that
neither dozing nor thinking
addressed its god as if
 
I were he in the clouds. Enfeebled
the walled-in infancy of these lines
are nothing but pictorial imagination
if in the wheatfield I remain
 
lying down long to think it over
 
 
                    -translated by Lucia Re and Paul Vangelisti
 
Sun & Moon Press will bepublishing Amelia's book,
WAR VARIATIONS, next month.

Dear Doug --
 
Saddenned to hear of Amelia Rosselli s death, whom I remember fondly
from the Italian poetry fest in NYC.  The enclosed, if it fills in something,
is from the commentary on her work in second volume of Millennium.  To
which we ll now (alas) be adding a death date & perhaps a sentence or
a line of termination.
 
I look forward to the book.
 
As ever,
 
JERRY

Amelia Rosselli
 
Science-fiction folly / valiant sicknesses / impediments to writing /
totality to be described // will to write / will to survive / will to
impede / tyranny  (A.R., Pheasant, p. 171)
 
Child of her time, she was seven years old when her anti-fascist father,
Carlo Rosselli, was assassinated by French gunmen outside Paris;
grew up with her English (Irish-Catholic) mother, first in England, then
New York; studied literature & music (a continuing concern) in Rome
& London; settled later in the Rosselli home in Florence. Onset of
mental illness came with her mother s death during her student days:
an openness to voices & destructive fears; later a struggle with the
institutions that confined her.  If this gives an edge to her work   as
to that of Hvlderlin, or Artaud, or Campana before her   her work
itself, like theirs, is testimony to the power of a profoundly
experimental poetics, here in its postmodern, Italian incarnation.
(Below, page 000.)  To see such work as merely madness is, of
course, to miss its genius; for what is most at stake here (so writes
Lucia Re)  is the conjunction of linguistic experimentation with a kind
of  staging  of the self, a staging which in turn involves the dimensions
of the  personal  and the  private  (a personal which, however, is no
longer personal and a private which is no longer private, once they
have become part of the mise-en-schne of the poetic text). ... The
obscurity of her language, the character of radical artifice that her
poems often assume, and the mystical dimension that emerges in them,
may [in fact] be seen as a political gesture of protest.   And Rosselli
on her own behalf:  Lo scritto che in me h folle risponde / a tutto
questo dolore con parole sempre / spero sempre vere [The writing
that in me is madness answers / all this pain with words I always /
yearn for always true].

Quite ahead of time, but just to mention possible DC reading. We're doing
something for Charles B. that Thurs. which I suppose cld be combined but
better wld be to do you each on different nights. Play up the anthology etc,
allow you both to read longer. . . all of which to say, do you have any idea

Enjoyed your post, few things on there I'd missed, particularly Radio Corpse,

I can't remember who originally posted the question about Stein's _Tender
Buttons_, but I hope the following will be helpful to whoever was
interested.  There have been several posts on this with useful reading
suggestions, so I won't reiterate those titles.  If you haven't already
looked at "Poetry and Grammar," in _Lectures In America_, that's the
essay where Stein talks at length about _TB_ and about the difference
between poetry and prose in general.  However, I took the original
question to be more of a textual studies question than a question about
Stein's theory of composition.  I have read a bunch of Stein stuff (I'm
writing my dissertation on her), but I can't recall seeing any but the
most cursory accounts of the composition process for _TB_.  In other
words, biographers and others have noted rough dates for when she would
have begun the poems, but I haven't seen anything about which sections
came first or how she determined order, grouping, etc.  I also have never
had the opportunity to look at the MS's at Yale, so I don't know what
exists of the poems in MS form, but certainly that might be a place to start.

Dodie, Maria, et al:
 
In "The Laugh of the Medusa" Helene Cixous writes, "woman must write
woman. And man, man. . . . By writing her self, woman will return to the
body . . . Women must write through their bodies, they must invent the
impregnable language that will wreck partitions, classes, and rhetorics,
regulations and codes, they must submerge, cut through, get beyond the
ultimate reserve-discourse, including the one that laughs at the very
idea of pronouncing the word `silence,' the one that, aiming for the
impossible, stops short before the word `impossible' and writes it as
`the end.'"

a very odd, i would think academic, response from pierre joris re: primary

but that can imply an agenda, a politics. as if that came first, which
an anthologist, certain of his/her priority, might mistakenly assume. the
anthology, if it is good, does not provide "coherence" but differences,
no?

In *"Favored Strangers": Gertrude Stein and Her Family* (Rutgers UP,
1995), Linda Wagner-Martin writes,
 
        Judging from the manuscript versions of the originals, the assembly
        of the parts into one long prose poem was itself whimsical.  In a
        letter to "my dear Miss Claire," Gertrude wrote in what sounded like
        the imperative case: "Tender Buttons, will be the title . . . and
        after it the three short titles, Food, Rooms, Objects."  Perhaps
        the arrangement did not matter: when *Tender Buttons* appeared, with
        no context, it was often treated like a joke.

Just curious, b/c I tried something like this teaching a section recently
and was wondering:
        Has anyone out there done any work with, or does anyone out there
know of someone else having done any work with, Charles Bernstein's ideas
in "Artifice of Absorption" concerning *prose*?  And here I'm interested
specifically in what will now be arbitrarily defined as "conventional"
prose, as opposed to experimental stuff. (The connection I made was in a
19th century context.) Or for that matter, does anyone have any input on
this off the top of his or her particular head? Well?
        Feel free to back-channel your response, if you wish, and I offer
this liberty with absolutely no idea what "back-channeling" is. (Tho I
suppose I could guess.)

Ryan, and all--
 
When I first read Bernstein's essay/poem, I though of Richard Lanham's
work--The Motives of Eloquence especially, but also a wonderful essay in
Literacy and the Survival of Humanism called "At and Through: The Opaque
Style and Its Uses."  I'm sure many will appreciate the irony of this
particular confluence, given Lanham's interest in something he'd be
willing to call the "suvival of humanism," but it is, at least, a
humanism with what I like to think a decidedly smiling face.  (Lanham's
"Aristotle and the Illusion of Purpose," in the same book, might also
help open up this somewhat surprising overlap--or maybe I'm mistaken to
assume it will appear so universally surprising?  I tried Lanham out on
one member of this list some time back and received only mixed results.
Anyway, he's one of the best readers of renaissance prose I know, so I
recommend him sans hesitation.)  Hoping this proves useful, and that its
usefulness only serves to improve (or something aptly Sidneyesque along
those lines),

Subject:      Poetry Sightings
 
There were a couple of readings in New York this past weekend. On Friday
night, Heather Ramsdell, Chris Stroffolino and Lisa Jarnot read poems at
the Ichor Gallery on W 26th St. The event was hosted by Sam Truitt. The man
(forgive me, I misplaced my notes) who introduced Heather Ramsdell asked us
to consider the event as a "poetry listening", and then Heather read parts
of her poem "Bridge Section" and closed with a work in a similar style that
incorporated lines from the book "Go Dog, Go". Rod Smith, speaking through
Joe Ross (as part of Joe's collaboratively-written introduction to Chris
Stroffolino), advised the listeners to sit back and enjoy what would
undoubtedly be the greatest poetry reading of all time. Chris read a number
of recent poems in a personal, personably animated manner. A highlight of
his performance was a gathering of sententia modelled in parallel to Frank
O'Hara's "Lines for the Fortune Cookies"--I have to agree with Chris, his
lines are better. After a significant intermission, Lisa Jarnot read what
Judith Goldman described in her introduction as "something about
California". It _was_ something. Lisa's poetry which has long incorporated
what Judith called "up-to-date techniques" rather excitingly evoked a scene
of piers and on-ramps, and a first-person narrator (who may or may not be a
frozen squid) "in love with the parking lot". The reading left everyone
feeling at once drained and refreshed, eager to play pool or ramble along
Seventh Avenue. I myself went to the 55 Bar on Waverly, discussing the
geography of Atlanta with Bill Luoma.
        Christmas lights hang from the sprinkler pipes and the window in
the front of the room remains partially open during the readings at Ichor.
Beer and soda are available for $1. The gallery asks people who attend the
readings to contribute $3. Many people who subscribe or who used to
subscribe to the POETICS list attended last Friday's reading. The next
reading at Ichor will feature Ed Foster, Erica Hunt, and Sean Killian.
        Saturday afternoon at the Ear Inn, down at the end of Spring
Street, Kevin Davies and Joe Ross read. There were some slight problems
with the sound equipment but audience members sitting at the bar seemed to
have no trouble hearing the work. Kevin read a piece compiled from
imitations of his work by several of his friends (including Rob Fitterman,
Judith Goldman, Douglas Rothschild, and others; again, I've misplaced my
notes), self-parody, and other sources. My favorite point was when he
looked up and said "O Canada!" At the end of his reading, Kevin was
presented with a "League Champions 1978" trophy by Bruce Andrews. Joe Ross
followed Kevin, reading work from a variety of projects, including several
pages from a new book published by Potes & Poets. I particularly enjoyed
the poems from his "Fuzzy Logic" series, and a set of poems written using
the words broadcast to him by his television during a Washington Redskins
game, _in the order in which they were broadcast_.
        Readings at the Ear Inn are on Saturdays at 2:30. Listeners are
requested to donate $3, I think.

Eh? How's that?
Which part doesn't matter, and why?
Or is that jokes don't matter,
Or work which is delivered
Off-handedly and which doesn't

Dear Megan (long time no see),
 
That Cixous is certainly watery, isn't she?  But what she's saying here has
a slightly different twist that what Maria wrote, "writing the body."
Cixous here is talking about writing through the body, an idea which been
around for ages--even Susan Griffin was into that in the 70s, though
without the intellectual cache of Cixous.  I'm reminded of seeing Jane
Gallop years ago give a hilarious talk at San Francisco State where she
noted how popular mauve was for the covers of feminist anthologies.  Gallop
said that mauve was Frenchified pink.  Cixous, too, I feel is Frenchified
pink.
 
But, what I'm caught up in is Maria's far more radical phrasing--writing
the body.  I actually have a lot to say about this, but I had three grants
due this week and my brains are fried.  I'm thinking of writing an essay.
 
My-lips-they-are-not-one,
Dodie

I'm not sure, as I haven't been around much as of late, if this strain
is strictly reserved for a feminist angle or application. However, I
would like to point out that I too find Maria's phrasing radically
different from Cix's, and, in some respects more interesting (maybe
because I have access to it then).  "Selected Organs", Nichol's
"autoBIOgraphy", is a fine example of the difference: writing the body
as writing, the body as narrative (life)line.  Re-membering (not
intending a phallic twist).  I think it opens the forum of discussion
to other politics than those Cix circumnavigates--I should say, other
politics that JUST those.  So if I might pose a question, any thoughts
on the relationship between body and memory and the writing of?
(I keep seeing a tattoo I know of for some reason)

Ryan,
a book dealing broadly w/ the issues you're raising-- from the point of view
of teaching composition-- is _Resisting Writings (and the Boundaries of
Composition_
by Derek Owens (SMU Press, '94). Deals with Charles B. a bit, tho not
"Artifice" particularly, but also Cage, Howe, DuPlessis, Olson, Smitherman,
Tedlock, Silliman, many others. The book begins with an epigraph from Charles
"Inflexible standardization is the arteriosclerosis of language." While being
"about" teaching it ain't no manual, very interesting book.

  It seems alot of american poet women really can't stand Cixous
  (warning: generalization--be glad to be proved wrong)....
  I too am curious about Maria's reformulation of "writing THE body"
  but I also think that Cixous is not just the watery bodily fluid writer
  of the EARLIER MEDUSA. I don't think it's there much in THREE STEPS
  ON THE LADDER OF WRITING and that she's being pigeonholed by her early
  work. I guess Rachel Blau Du Plessis (whose book by the way has that
  dreaded pink cover, perhaps, Dodie was referring to) and Susan Howe
  using Cixous as a straw woman doesn't help matters much amongst "poetics"
  people, and I DO find Clarice Lispector at least as poetic as H.D.

I didn't know this about Rachel and Susan . . . but, Chris, Kevin tells me
there's a movie starring Gina Lollobrigida and Sean Connery and Ralph
Richardson called _Woman of Straw_!   I wonder if either Rachel or Susan
saw it and it affected their stance on Cixous.  The film supposedly shows
the depravity of the "modern" "European" woman.

Ryan -- It strikes me that there's something like a family resemblance between
Bernstein on poetry in "Artifice of Absorption" & Barthes on 19th-cent. prose
in "S/Z" & "Pleasure of the Text" especially.  And I think I do mean family re-
semblance, in the sense that Bernstein is building on/reacting to Veronica For-

Tel Quel poetics), i.e., straight out of Barthes' intellectual milieu -- possi-

NIGERIA: PEN RAPID ACTION FOR DETAINED WRITERS AND JOURNALISTS
 
The Writers in Prison Committee (WiPC) of International PEN has
issued an appeal for writers and journalists detained in Nigeria in
the month that marks the first anniversary of the beginning of Ken
Saro-Wiwa's trial and the first anniversary of the detention of
writer Mohammed Sule. At least six writers and journalists are
currently held in Nigeria, including four journalists -- Christine
Anyanwu, Ben Charles Obi, Kunle Ajibade and George Mbah -- whose
life sentences were reduced to 15 years in October. Also in jail
are: Mohammed Sule, who was detained on 9 February 1995 and is
still being held without charge or trial, apparently in connection
with a film he was planning to make; and Nosa Igiebor, editor-in-
chief of "Tell", who was detained on 23 December 1995.

Today is the 20th anniversary of Sun & Moon Press.
The first issue of the magazine was published and
arrived at our offices on February 13th in 1976.
I thought I'd celebrate by listing some of our brand
new titles, all out just since the beginning of the year.
 
 
PAINTED TURTLE, by Clarence Major
Paperback, $11.95 (1-55713-085-X)
 
 
This simply told work, in which Clarence Major explores
the life of an unwed mother and her background on the Zuni
reservation, was published in a cloth edition by Sun & Moon
Press in 1988. Long out of print, the book, which THE NEW YORK
TIMES characterzied as being "a fresh tale of the spiritually
transforming power of love told without sanctimony or
sentimentality," is now republished into our Classics Series
in paperback.
 
 
ELEMENOPY, by Michael Coffey
Paperback, $10.95 (1-55713-240-2)
New American Poetry Series: 22
 
Poet Michael Coffey created ELEMENOPY as a book, rather
than as a collection of poems, in order to respresent a
procession of struggles and outcomes in his and the poems'
relationship to language. The first section, "Loving,"
contains playful poems that delight in the promise of poetic
form and lyric utterance. "Lichen," the second section, is
made up of two longer prose poems, each a kind of ill-fated
narrative event. In the third section, "Otherwards," Coffey
appropriates the words and techniques of other authors--
namely Gertrude Stein and Jackson Mac Low--to break through
to fresher possibilities for narrative. "Javajazyk," the
concluding section, invents a language in which to tell the
love story of Vasteny and Ombaly.
 
 
ANNIE SALEM, by Mac Wellman
Paperback, $12.95   (1-55713-207-0)
New American Fiction Series: 34
 
In this, his second novel, Mac Wellman continues his ex-
ploration-begun in his award-winning plays A MURDER OF
CROWS and THE HYACINTH MACAW--of a low-rent rural America,
festering in the backwater pollution from the urban en-
viornment. Wellman's astonishing Ohio-like world has been
tagged by some theatergoers and critics as "Macland," a
world peopled by cantankerous, wistful, confused, and
frightened people who have lost parts of their body, their
minds, and their souls to the perpetual machine of the
American dream.
 
FAIR REALISM, by Barbara Guest
Paperback, $10.95  (1-55713-245-5)
 
A reprinting, into the Sun & Moon Classics and into paper-
back, of Barbara Guest's award-winning collection
of poems.
 
 
WRITING IS AN AID TO MEMORY, by Lyn Hejinian
Paperback, $9.95  (1-55713-271-2)
 
Long out of print, WRITING IS AN AID TO MEMORY is one of
Hejinian's major early works. The book was first published
in 1987, and has since gained wide readership; but over the
last few years the book has gone out of print. This edition
reprints the book into the Sun & Moon Classics.

Have read much Cixous and don't submit to her theory as I find it rather
limiting, and think that it actually subscribes to the thing it is
opposing, oppression etc., as women's writing should after all be free of
confines and restrictions, right? It should transcend sexuality shouldn't
it? It should be free to do what it wants, even if that means jumping
into the noise and cacophony of  male language and making something of that.
I know whDat she's getting at, and LUCE IRIGARAY and ADRIENNE RICH
are both getting at a similar thing, but I nonetheless think it's a more
confining, rather than liberating position to adopt when discussing
women's creative process as it exists beneath the oppressive forces of a
patriarchal structure.

collaboration, a kind of "deformation professionelle" had me immediately
fascinated with the conceptof a book put together by a troika. & the focus
if theoretically stated in the intro isn't necessarily immediately visible
in the construction of the book using, as it does, alphabetical order as
ordering principle of the authors. Nothing wrong with that either -- the
alphabet is an honorable tradition. But I'll be able to give a better
account of the book once I've lived with it for awhile, for the book is
obviously big & rich enough to permit that. -- Pierre

I second that last observation--I love Lispector's writing.  I saw Cixous
speak at UC Irvine about 6 years ago and found her very engaging, playful
with language in a very conscious and opening way.  I haven't read the Du
Plessis or Howe books that make Cixous a "straw woman"--could someone pass
on a little more info on what the general objection seems to be?

One area to consider if you're going to talk about "writing the body"
in the context of poetry is the blurring distinction between poetry
and talk.  What is the physiology of talk - especially high-tech
written talk (i.e. what we're engaged in on this list) - or does
such a physiology even exist?  Whereas poetry in the past has had
a distinct physiology (rhythm, breath, singing, chanting, sound,
lyricism).  And has talk, discourse, poetics, textuality, etc.
replaced poetry?  And within this arena is the "concept" of
"writing the body" a kind of parody (as Mark Rothko defined
parody : "the ghost of an idea")?  In such an environment perhaps
the fine-art fine press poetry book - a concrete visual experience
supporting the spare lingo contained therein - maybe represents
a kind of fetishism of the ghost of poetry (as opposed to talk).
Remember the time before printing presses & typewriters & computers,
when writing was different from talking (& granted elitist & mandarin)?
Back then written poetry tried to capture the physicality of
oral poetry to some extent.  Those distinctions are blurred now
by talk, just as "mass reproduction" has changed visual art.
& I wonder what the meaning of "eros" really is in the universe
of techno-talk-babble.  An image of an image of an image. - Henry Gould

Since Sun & Moon Classics represent major texts of the 20th century and
before, we generally include in our Classics any book reprinted (since the pre-
sumes a certain wider audience) or a writer generally recognized as an
important
figure in the American and/or international literary scenes. Our Classics
writers have also generally established international reputations.Finally,
there is an aspeact of age connected with this; the  writers of the Classics
are generally (there are few exceptions) 50 or older. Finally, all translations
(sincewe have claimed they are internationally important enough to be
translated)
are included in the Classics series. Major, Guest, and Hejinian all fit these
patterns. Once a writers has been published in the Classics, all his or her
works are included in that series. The other series are about new and
developing
talent. No series is preferable; some writers would rather been seen as
developing than as "recognized" (i.e. somewhat established).

Cixous said at the Irvine lecture in '89 (or was it '88?) that Genet could
do it.  And Shakespeare, in the character of Cleopatra (she didn't mention
any of Shakey's other women).  I would tend to see gender in writing (who
knows, probably in life too, if we had the courage to live that way) as not
two opposed camps, but as a spectrum on/through/across which the writing can
move freely.  Which is to second Nicole's problem with Cixous, although of
course in certain ways Cixous does (or did--haven't read her more recently)
say the aim is a sort of bisexuality which doesn't sit in between the two
camps but embraces them both, and in so doing, does transcend sexuality.

again, tho, i'd insist that "design" or "focus" is precisely what the
poetry, not the editor, must provide. the value of a troika (particularly
when they themselves have such radically different poetics) is that it
can undermine assumptions about "design." i think that if an anthology
has a "coherent menu," the editor may think the poems are "objects,"
arranged.

cixous says that ecruitur feminine is "writing of a decipherable libidinal
feminity which can be read in writing produced by a male or a female"
(cixous in Moi, _sexual / textual politics_)
 
but ecriture feminine is not writing the body.  the body is for cixous
the locale of the soul; indeed the body is the soul.  so in order to
present states of the soul (a long time (ancient!) goal of poetics)
cixous wants writing to perform the behaviors of the body.
 
she writes:
"Soul!  What a beautiful word!  Like: god!  What a word!  We say: soul,
as if we knew what it is and where it is, in the vicinity of this unknown
one, I proceed exploring with the help of my myopia: I scrutinize 'the
movements of the soul,' from close up, I observe the passions at the
moment they manifest themselves, such as they express themselves,
translate themselves, first of all in out bodies.
Where does the tragedy first of all take place?  In the body, in the
stomach, in the legs, as we know since the Greek tragedies.  Aeschylus's
characters tell, first and foremost, a body state.  Myself--I realized
this afterwards--I began by carrying out a rehabilitation of these body
states since they are so eloquent, since they concretely speak the
troubles of our souls.  In this area, I work under the microscope, as a
spiritual atomist."    --preface to the H. Cixous Reader, Susan Sellars, ed.
 
as to american women poets not taking to cixous, this american woman poet
would have to absolutely disagree: cixous, and especially writing the
body, informs my poetry more than almost anything else.  one of my PhD
comp exams was about writing the body, cixous and my own works, even!  if
any one out there would like to see what i do w/ writing the body, i'd be
glad to post a poem.

Can anyone tell me anything about the availability of Johanna
Drucker's so-called "visual books" including (but not limited

_Otherspace_ (1992). I know these works were produced by a
private press with very limited print runs, so I assume they
will be expensive and hard to find . . .
 
Also, any recommendations for critical discussions or other

Shaunanne--please do post a poem.
 
Jouissance envy!?
 
Rimbaud & Sandy Stone can write feminine ecriture; Camille Paglia cannot.
After we get "ze" into general usage, perhaps we can strip "masculine" &
"feminine" of their oft-assumed male & female "counterparts."  I, too, find
the essentialism (Nicole sees in Cix & Rich & Irigaray) of some strains of
fem-intellectual thought annoying/oppressive.  Also the phrase "American
women poets"---whether we do or don't discard Cixous.  Oftentimes my more
"masculine" work has been misinterpreted by others to be far-out persona
stuff--whereas if I write about rape or some other "female" issue it's
automatically taken as confessional.  Usually just the opposite, of course.
 
I do, though, acknowledge the importance (continuing, I know, to many) of
the above-mentioned fem folks' work.

yes, i agree: i find ecriture feminine essentialist (and therefore
dangerous) as well: a libidinal economy is no less dualistic that a
phallogocentric one.
but i do find writing the body a truly remarkable project,in that i like
the idea of the soul being the body.  i can work with that--there is a
curious presence of absence if we make the body the soul--and i like that!
 
to that end, this poem:
 
 
VOCAL-EASE
 
your tongue at the back
of my neck
whispers
daisy no rosebud no
i mean yes
yes where your fingers
improvise petal
after petal
a spellbound orchid
my mouth
describes the gladioli bent
arc of your back where my
hands find the velvet fur of
stamen on my tongue
lilac lupin sticky stammering
crocus hallelujahs
echo in our eyes
as our bodies recite
the power and the glory
until amen
and sweat fuchsias clinging
to the white adobe of
this moment
 
we falter apart
 
for three days
you die inside me
 
kneeling palm denominating
mine own palm
my tongue
deliberates my once
honeysuckled lips cannot mouth
your name
 
and so i pray
 
 
 
best,
shaunanne

I don't actually remember the days before printing presses, as I have not
reached the young age of 550 or so. But I think writing and talking have
always had a generative relationship with one another, and certainly not all
writing was trying to capture the physicality of oral poetry. I think of
speech and writing as having a different kind of physicality in pre-modern
(and in some ways modern begins about the time of the development of the
printing press) Europe. I'm not certain how these distinctions apply to many
parts of the world. The meaning of eros is up for dispute at any time, but I
do think it still exists in the universe of "techno-talk-babble," probably
even has to move to include the techno, the talk, and the babble.
 
But whoever said the lingo in a poetry book (fine-art press or otherwise) is
necessarily spare. Do not spare the lingo . . .

Subject:      Sun & Moon brand equity
 
Douglas,
 
I appreciated your articulation of Classics. I've often wondered about
that as a series and of the whole question of brand equity in poetry
generally (the "classic" example being City Lights Pocket Poets Series
as distinct from regular City Lights books). It works when somebody
(me, say) likes a given series and is open to thumbing through and
maybe buying with less foreknowledge a new book in a given series just
because I've learned to trust the series. Nathaniel Tarn's great run at
Grossman/Cape would be an example: because I trusted Olson's Mayan
Letters, I was willing to buy books by Henri Lefebvre (still one of my
all time faves), Victor Segalen (French anticipation of Spicer?), and
Nazim Hikmet (a great poet, the Williams of the Middle East).
 
Is there any evidence that an S&M book sells better when it's a
"classic" than when it's not??
 
All best,
 
Ron Silliman

Re: "spare lingo", Charles, I referring to poetry tending toward "concrete",
emphasizing the visual effect on the page, beautifully designed & printed,
disrupting "normal" syntax - a kind of poetry in which the "visceral",
the "proprioceptive", has been transmogrified into pure visual & tactile
effect, and the pome is a kind of unreadable letter in a bottle, no
clue to performance etc.  It seems like one path that poetry in its
discontent has taken away from mass publishing & mainstream po-biz,
and in contact with the visual arts.
   This is pretty obvious & is not meant as a negative comment.  I would
imagine that where there is a convergence between art publishing &
poetry in performance you would find the most dynamic poetry scene.
And this would be the [theoretical] place where a genuine civic/creative
atmosphere (as opposed to an in-group typical American hobby
subculture) would be sparked.
   To those sophisticates who are thinking "where's he been all these

Joke.Witz.Wit.
Of course, Tender Buttons is a Joke, the very sort of joke that
the free Martiniquan tells the silly guy who, enslaved to his notion
of cosmopolitanism, has arrived home to bring messages and proofs of
attainment.In Fanon's tale, the returned exile, doesn't laugh.
Tender Buttons is one big guffaw at straight domesticity and
sophisticated femininity and perhaps lipstick lesbians.
Part of the wit--or the viciousness--is that all you "guys" not in

As has been noted "Proprioception" is an essay by Olson. But long before
Olson's take on it, the concept existed, not only in the dance world, but
in anatomy, psychology, occupational therapy and other related fields.
 
Proprioception describes your sense of the physicality of your body. Both
generally, as in knowing that you have feet at the ends of your legs when
you aren't looking at them, but also more specifically a sense of your
internal organs, their relative placement, workings, and interactions.

I believe that Simulant Portrait, Otherspace, and any other offset printed
books by Johanna are still available. You might try Printed Matter in New
York (sorry, I don't have the address at hand). Minnesota Center for Book
Arts (24 N. Third St.,  Minneapolis, MN  55419, 612-338-3634) has had them,
but I know they are re-defining their studio shop, so I'm not certain if
they still have them or not. I believe The Word Made Flesh and History of
The/My World, in the original editions, are entirely unavailable. I recently
showed my copy of the former to a class I'm teaching on 20th Century
typography. There's really nothing else quite like it. The latter has just
been reprinted in an offset-printed edition by Granary Books in New York,
which I believe is also on this book arts discussion list.
 
Johanna Drucker also has a recent novel out from Detour Press in St. Paul,
Minnesota, which is available from Small Press Distribution, 1814 San Pablo
Ave., Berkeley, Ca  94702. Come to think of it, her other offset-printed
books may be available from Small Press Distribution as well.
 
I have not seen critical discussion of her work, which is unfortunate. But
to inform her creative work I think it is important to read some of her own
critical work, including The Century of Artist's Books (Granary, 1995) and
The Visual Word.

But I think that for his "comprehensive" (and can anything be comprehensive
in Olson, maybe, with proprioception in mind, com-prehensile would be
better) take on it one should read the essay in conjunction with many of the
Maximus Poems, particularly from Maximus Poems IV, V, VI, and from The
Maximus Poems Volume Three.

from volume 3:
 
I believe in God
as fully physical

hanging on it

Olson's "proprio" is always turning eternal, historical, mythic

also from volume 3:
 
as against what we know went on, the dream: the dream being
self-action with Whitehead's important corollary: that no event

St. Petersburg, St. Paul, what's the difference? (I can ask this in
semi-innocence, not having been to Florida in my lifetime.) St. Paul is home
to the winter carnival, where winter queens are crowned, the devil is beaten
away by the icy forces of good; this year, with thirty-four-below-zero
temperatures and sixty-below wind chills that week, even parts of that
carnival were canceled. St. Paul is also home, of course, to Detour Press,
Exile, Minnesota Project for Contemporary Language Arts, and more.
 
Speaking of twin cities, if anyone's in the vicinity, there will be a 3-day
residency of visiting writers MEI-MEI BERSSENBRUGGE and MYUNG MI KIM,
co-sponsored by Univ. of Minnesota Creative Writing Program, Minnesota
Center for Book Arts (I was director when this ball got rolling and am glad
it was carried through), and Asian American Renaissance. I don't have all
the details in front of me, but I know there is --
 
a reading on March 8, Friday, at 7 pm
Minnesota Center for Book Arts in Minneapolis
24 North Third Street
 
a "fireside chat" with the poets on March 6, Wednesday, at 6:30 - 8:00 pm
Asian American Renaissance in St. Paul
 
The poets are also leading a workshop of creative writing students at
U-Minnesota, but I don't believe that's open to the public.
 
Chip Schilling, resident artist in bookmaking at Minnesota Center for Book
Arts, is making a chapbook containing works by both poets, a limited edition
handmade book which will be available for sale. Call Minnesota Center for
Book Arts for details.
 
If anyone is around and wants addresses/directions, or other specific
information, please call Ann Somers or Sarah Manwaring at Minnesota Center
for Book Arts, 612-338-3634.

Subject:      Sun & Moon brand equity
 
Ron,
 
That's a good question. No, I don't see true evidence that a book
selles better if it's a "classic." Of course, most of the "classics"
are aimed, in the long-run, at the classroom, and, accordingly, over
a period of time they sell better. However, we keep almost all of our
books in print, so there's been many a time when a New American Fiction
or New American Poetry title sold better than a Classics original.
For example, Wendy Walker's THE SECRET SERVICE was first published
in the Classics Series (we had reprinted her THE SEA-RABBIT into that
series earlier). But her books sold far fewer copies that a gay
novel like PLACE OF SHELTER by new-comer Nolan Dennett. But, of course,
sales also have to do with when books are pubilshed, how they look,
and the inexplicable aspect of the audience.
 
Thanks for your observations.
 
Douglas
 
============================
 
Douglas,
 
I appreciated your articulation of Classics. I've often wondered about
that as a series and of the whole question of brand equity in poetry
generally (the "classic" example being City Lights Pocket Poets Series
as distinct from regular City Lights books). It works when somebody
(me, say) likes a given series and is open to thumbing through and
maybe buying with less foreknowledge a new book in a given series just
because I've learned to trust the series. Nathaniel Tarn's great run at
Grossman/Cape would be an example: because I trusted Olson's Mayan
Letters, I was willing to buy books by Henri Lefebvre (still one of my
all time faves), Victor Segalen (French anticipation of Spicer?), and
Nazim Hikmet (a great poet, the Williams of the Middle East).
 
Is there any evidence that an S&M book sells better when it's a
"classic" than when it's not??
 
All best,
 
Ron Silliman

Matt,
 
Quite a lot of Drucker's work is available at Woodland Pattern, where she
currently has a show.  Their phone number is (414) 263-5001.  I'm pretty sure
they have copies of "Simulant Portrait", "The Word Made Flesh", "Just As",
and "Dark Decade" (her Detour novel), though I'm not sure they have
"Otherspace."
 
Her email address is or was recently johanna.drucker@yale.edu
 
Also, this past summer she contributed to a show of Visual Poetry that I
co-curated.  The catalog, which is still available, has a general overview
essay on Visual Poetry and some pieces from "The Word Made Flesh."  If you
want a copy let me know backchannel.

Seems to me that Stein was very PRO-"domesticity"/domiciles as long as she
wasn't the one having to make the mutton (or type the manuscript, etc.).  In
some sense I read Buttons as a *celebration* (as opposed to a mockery,
though one can certainly celebrate & mock simultaneously) of daily, domestic
life. Or an exploration of/meditation on it.  I agree that Stein's work is
often infused with wit----but not that the entire "point" was wit or "one
big guffaw."
 
Also--AliceBT was pretty lipsticky herself (I'm talking looks here; she
*was* quite the intellectual---don't know if by "lipstick lesbian" you're
connoting "incapable bimbo" or merely "femme").
 
Kathryne---could you write more about what led you to your above-quoted
assertion?  Back or front.

As a bookseller I can second Doug's observation that the  classics series
doesn't sell better than the NAP or NAF. Given the uniform size & "look" of
Sun & Moon the entire press has acheived "buyer recognition" -- I'd say I
really began to notice this around 2 years ago. It's as though a threshold
was reached in terms of number of titles (kind of a hundredth monkey theory).
Though I'd bet the Classics series sells better to libraries.

A spectacularly successful launch was held on Monday night (12 Feb) at the East
West Gallery, London, for OUT OF EVERYWHERE: linguistically innovative poetry by
women in North America & the UK. The gallery space was packed and people were
spilling out onto the pavement outside.
 
All eight UK based contributors to the anthology were there to read their work:
Caroline Bergvall, Paula Claire, Grace Lake, Wendy Mulford, Maggie O'Sullivan,
Carlyle Reedy, Denise Riley and Geraldine Monk. They were joined by two
transatlantic visitors, Fiona Templeton and Kathleen Fraser. Kathleen prefaced
her reading with a poem by Barbara Guest. Geraldine was almost inaudible through
laryngitis, but managed a raucous partial delivery. Paula handed out ginkgo tree
leaves. Everyone was in fine fettle.
 
The following evening Maggie and Geraldine gave a more extended reading in the
SubVoicive series at the Three Cups pub in Holborn. On March 1, they will also
be reading in Durham, together with Nicole Brossard and Daphne Marlatt, to
celebrate both the book and Basil Bunting's birthday. This is courtesy of Ric
Caddel and Diana Collecott.
 
Just for the record, the other US and Canadian contributors to OUT OF EVERYWHERE
are: Rae Armantrout, Nicole Brossard, Tina Darragh, Deanna Ferguson,  Barbara
Guest, Carla Harryman, Lyn Hejinian, Fanny Howe, Susan Howe, Karen MacCormack,
Bernadette Mayer, Melanie Neilson, Joan Retallack, Lisa Robertson, Leslie
Scalapino, Catriona Strang, Rosmarie Waldrop, Diane Ward, Hannah Weiner,
Marjorie Welish. The book is 256pp and retails for 9 pounds (around $15).
 
I am now submerged in jiffy bags as I try to fulfil orders. Contributors who
lurk here: your copy is on its way, but by surface mail to save cost, so it may
be a few weeks yet. Likewise, SPD and Marginal Distribution should be receiving
copies in the next few weeks.

yes, of course. genet is most often used as an example.  personally i don't
believe (i don't think) in "ecriture feminine," though it's a useful concept
to have around in the mix, if only to refute, refine, revise, oppose, etc,

Poetics List--
 
Just thought I'd draw yr eye to my call for papers in the present mla
newsletter--It's titled Poetry in the Curriculum (under special sessions,
which is alphabetized, and which also means, of course, it has to be
approved after I've formed the panel).  It comes from frustration, some
my own, some my friends and students, about the "place" of poetry in the
present English dept. curriculum--in the shadows, so much, of the
"sexier" (and more marketable?) genres & theories.  I'm hoping, of
course, to get some kind of discussion going, one that will
appeal not just to poetry nuts but to others more generally concerned
with pedagogical and curricular issues in departments of English, comp
lit, and lit studies-- a discussion that can affirm, in I hope of variety
of ways, the importance of poetry in the curriculum, and help define what
that importance might actually be.
 
The call goes (something) like this (I don't have my copy here):
 
Poetry in the curriculum: graduate programs, undergraduate programs,
poetry and theory, poetry and cultural studies, anthologies, new
poetries, traditions of poetry, introductory courses, innovative
courses.
 
I hope this is broad enough: I'm interested in all aspects of the place
of poetry in the curriculum.

Court Says Printing of "Course Packs" Does Not Violate Copyright Law
 
A federal appeals court Monday ruled that a copy-shop owner did not
violate
copyright laws when he copied materials for college courses without
getting
permission from the publishers or paying sufficient royalties.
 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that James M.
Smith,
owner of Michigan Document Services, was protected by the "fair use"
provisions of copyright law and had not infringed on the copyrights of
the
three publishers that sued him in 1992. The court overruled a district
judge's decision rendered in 1994.
 
Mr. Smith's five small copy shops serve the University of Michigan,
Eastern
Michigan University, and other institutions in the Ann Arbor, Mich.,
area.
The case involved the preparation of "course packs," materials copied
from
books and journals and packaged for particular courses.
 
He and others in the photocopy business have said that the current
process
for obtaining permission to reproduce copyrighted materials is
time-consuming, cumbersome, and expensive. They say that course packs,
which
are ubiquitous in higher education, allow professors to assign
important
reading in books and journals that would be too costly for students to
purchase individually.
 
Under the fair-use provisions of copyright law, reproducing copyrighted
material is acceptable for "teaching (including multiple copies for
classroom use)." The law outlines four factors to be considered in
determining whether fair use has been observed: the character of the
use,
including whether it is for a commercial or non-profit purpose; the
nature
of the copyrighted work; the length and importance of the portion used
in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and the effect of its use
on
the copyrighted work's potential market and value.
 
The appeals court said that even though Mr. Smith had profited from
making
the copies, he qualified for fair-use protection because the copies
were for
educational purposes. The court said Mr. Smith had not exploited
copyrighted
material because his fee was not based on the content of the books he
copied. He charged by the page, regardless of whether the content was
copyrighted.
 
"The business of producing and selling coursepacks is more properly
viewed
as the exploitation of professional copying technologies and the
inability
of academic parties to reproduce printed materials efficiently, not the
exploitation of copyrighted, creative materials," the appeals court
said.
"We hold that the Copyright Act does not prohibit professors and
students
who may make copies themselves from using the photoreproduction
services of
a third party in order to obtain those same copies at less cost."
 
The court also said that the copyrighted materials Mr. Smith had
reproduced
for the course packs were not "excerpted so substantially that the
coursepacks superseded the original works."
 
In determining the effect the copies had on the copyrighted works'
market
and value, the court said that the publishers had not proved that the
course
packs affected the current or potential market for the original works.
The
plaintiffs in the case were the Free Press, Princeton University Press,
and
St. Martin's Press.
 
In a dissenting opinion, Judge David A. Nelson said the publishers had
demonstrated the adverse effect that unauthorized copies such as Mr.
Smith's
had on the value of copyrighted works. He said that if other copy-shop
owners were to follow Mr. Smith's lead and stop paying permission fees,
"the
potential value of the copyrighted works of scholarship published by
the
plaintiffs would be diminished."

A friend in Houghton Mifflin's legal department tells me that Mr. Smith had
mailed a couple of checks for an amount that he estimated to be fair when his
case wasn't going so well.  I wonder if he'll want them back.

     I mean, WHO really gets money from writing poetry? (aside from

The physiology exists--but, as Brian Eno notes in the April '95 issue of
_Wired_, at present it's really limiting.  The way the human body interacts
with the computer is limited to eyes and fingers for the most part, and
there's a huge, mostly untapped potential to make using a computer more
physically liberating via integrating gestural communication,
voice-interaction, and so on.

I would say such things have *always* been replacing poetry, but to the
extent that they can't substitute for the essence of it, poetry continues to
break through what covers it.  One of my favorite parts of Deleuze and
Guattari's _What is Philosophy_ is the following:
 
"In a violently poetic text, Lawrence describes what produces poetry: people
are constantly putting up an umbrella that shelters them and on the
underside of which they draw a firmament and write their conventions and
opinions.  But poets, artists, make a slit in the umbrella, they tear open
the firmament itself, to let in a bit of free and windy chaos and to frame
in a sudden light a vision that appears throughthe rent--Wordsworth's spring
or Cezanne's apple, the silhouettes of Macbeth or Ahab.  Then come the crowd
of imitators who repair the umbrella with something vaguely resembling the
vision, and the crowd of commentators who patch over the rent with opinions:
communication.  Other artists are always needed to make other slits, to
carry out necessary and perhaps ever-greater destructions, thereby restoring
to their predecessors the incommunicable novelty that we could no longer
see.  This is to say that artists struggle less against chaos (that, in a
certain manner, all their wishes summon forth) than against the "cliches of
opinion."

Well, we've got a double-edged (s)word here, meaning-wise:  eros may
everywhere be subject to the reductive tendencies of local representations
(adult BBS's and so forth), but there's as it were another eros that can't
be pinned down by this process of representation that can at any moment slip
in and create the "shattering realization", so to speak, the sublime.

I agree with you, Chris.  & add that I was first introduced to Michael
Palmer & Hejinian in a "free" course packet o' xeroxes...and then
immediately went out and bought whatever I could find of them.  One can
think of these things as the best advertisements for seducing those of us
who don't have the money to walk into a bookstore & buy stuff sight unread
(you don't want reviewers & critics to be all we have to go on, do you?).
On the other hand, it's funny....all this talk in the past 20 years about
the writer disappearing from the text...maybe the writer's *compensation* is
the first to go...

Also, while it might be bad for some publishers, I think that it is
difficult to get information about books out to people who aren't already
tuned into small press/poetics channels. So if someone wanted to copy a few
to several pages out of a Chax book, I would see that as potentially a good
marketing tool to interest students in the entire book. If someone on the
other hand was copying a third of a book or so, then I wouldn't like it, but
it seems like that would probably be more protected.

Regarding "voicing" the computer, someone backchanneled a note to me
pointing out that contemporary composers have some interesting things to
say on all this under the subject "compositional linguistics" (he
mentioned Cage among others).
 
Enjoyed the Deleuze/Guattari quote, but I thought their emphasis on the
artist as inspired destructor of conventions sounds a little old hat
or over-emphasized in last 100 yrs.  I would like to hear more about
artist as absorber/responder/synthesizer; artist as gifted slowpoke
rather than swift avantgardian nemesis avatar blah blah... - Henry Gould

Well Chris, several poets actually do get money from
their poetry, in fact anthology rights the ONLY significant
money they will get, and it will increase as their
careers develop and they are included in more anthologies
and textbooks.
 
Several Sun & Moon authors did receive payment for
the Norton anthology and have received money for
inclusion in others.
 
Moreover, I find that many academics use the xerox to
give a small little "sample" of work, without any
context of the poets' larger body of writing, which I strong
question pedagogically.
 
I should also add that using an anthology or book in your
course helps to support the existence of presses like
Sun & Moon.
 
So I don't at all agree with your glib statements.

From the today's BOSTON GLOBE, J.W. Carney, the defense attorney for John Salvi:
 
"We represent the man who shot and killed Lee Ann Nichols and who shot and
killed Shannon Lowney. The question you have to focus on in this trial is not
what happened and not by whom did it happen, but why did it happen?"
 
While defending a sane man who killed two women in cold blood and wounded five
other people, Carney has the disadvantage of 1) not being able to speak in
clear sentences, and 2) not being able to discuss or read about the context of
the case on the internet because it contains the "A" word.
 
* The former sentence is mine, not the  GLOBE'S.

Subject:      Re: Copyright
 
Regarding the copyright issue, several posts have highlighted the silver
lining of the matter. However, there seem to be inconsistencies in the
sequence of judicial decisions relating to rights connected with written work.
 
I wonder whether citizens would be willing to have the same practices (as
those described by the quoted news story) applied to patents.  The cash of
the matter is factual, but the principles and practices being encouraged do
seem to take advantage of a group already disadvantaged economically
(writers).
 
Fortunately or unfortunately, I brush up against this issue from at least
two different sides:  as writer and as disseminator of information.  But as
Ferris Bueller would say, "That doesn't change the fact that I still don't
have a car." (The principle of the thing)

dear all,
 
  here is some information that I had been forwarded about the
abortion-com restrictions.  While certainly any move in the direction
that the bill intends toward is frightening, this info shows that
precedents, hopefully, will prevent the new legislation from actually
being enforced, [though e-mailling the whitehouse is probably still a

Here's what I've found out about the limitations on the dissemination of
abortion materials contained within the telecom reform bill:
 
(The amended text of the Telecom Bill follows below, along with U.S.C. 18,
Section 1462.)
 
Basically we're talking about a provision that extends a section of the US
Code (The Comstock Act) prohibiting certain kinds of "obscene" speech to
include "interactive computer services."
 
Schroeder's office (202-225-4431) faxed me their position... they say that
the changes "will criminalize a wide array of public health information
relating to abortion, including discussion of RU-486 on the Internet."
Perhaps, but...
 
Sam Stratman from Rep. Hyde's office (202-225-4561) insists subsection (c)
of Section 1462 has already been invalidated by the courts (although it
remains on the books), so the extension of 1462 to include "interactive
computer services" would have no bearing on abortion-related materials.
 
According to the Center for Reproductive Law & Policy (212-514-5534), the
last time ANY court has ruled on subsection (c) was in 1919... long before
Roe v. Wade.  They say the statute remains on the books, although it has
long gone unenforced.
 
Steven Lieberman from the NY State Bar clarified things even further.
Lieberman says that the prohibitions in subsection (c) against the
dissemination of information about abortion were invalidated by the Supreme
Court in Bigelow v. Virginia in 1975. (This was a case concerning the
availablity of out-of-state abortion materials in the state of Virginia.)
As for the prohibitions against any "drug, medicine, article, or thing
designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion"... these were
invalidated by Roe v. Wade.
 
So, as Lieberman summarized the situation, "A prosecution under subsection
(c) of Section 1462 would be doomed from the outset."  Nevertheless, from a
strictly formal standpoint, it appears that the prohibitions on abortion
information are indeed in place... even if they are toothless.

Sec. 507 of the Telecom Bill Ammends Section 1462 of title 18 of the U.S.
Code (Chapter 71), in ways which may make sending the following over the
Internet illegal:
 
 o any text, graphic, or sound that is lewd, lascivious, or filthy
 
 o any information telling about how to obtain or make abortions and
   drugs, or obtaining or making anything that is for indecent or immoral
   use
 
Here is Section 1462 as Ammended:
 
(Telecom bill chnages in "<" and ">"):
 
Section 1462. Importation or transportation of obscene matters
 
Whoever brings into the United States, or any place subject to the
jurisdiction thereof, or knowingly uses any express company or other common
carrier <or interactive computer service (as defined in section 230(e)(2) of
the Communications Act of 1934)>, for carriage in interstate or foreign
commerce -
 
        (a) any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy book, pamphlet, picture,
motion-picture film, paper, letter, writing, print, or other matter of
indecent character; or
        (b) any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy phonograph recording,
electrical transcription, or other article or thing capable of producing
sound; or
        (c) any drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or
intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use; or any
written or printed card, letter, circular, book, pamphlet, advertisement, or
notice of any kind giving information, directly or indirectly, where, how, or
of whom, or by what means any of such mentioned articles, matters, or things
may be obtained or made; or Whoever knowingly takes <or receives>, from such
express company or other common carrier <or interactive computer service (as
defined in section 230(e)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934)> any matter
or thing the carriage <or importation> of which is herein made unlawful -
 
       Shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five
years, or both, for the first such offense and shall be fined not more than
$10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both, for each such offense
thereafter.

Here is the text which addes the interactive computer service part
in the Telecom Bill:
 
SEC. 507. CLARIFICATION OF CURRENT LAWS REGARDING COMMUNICATION
OF OBSCENE MATERIALS THROUGH THE USE OF COMPUTERS.
     (a) Importation or Transportation.--Section 1462 of title 18, United
States Code, is amended--
 
          (1) in the first undesignated paragraph, by inserting ``or
interactive computer service (as defined in section 230(e)(2) of the
Communications Act of 1934)'' after ``carrier''; and
 
          (2)  in the second undesignated paragraph--
               (A) by inserting ``or receives,'' after ``takes'';
               (B) by inserting ``or interactive computer service (as defined
in section 230(e)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934)'' after ``common
carrier''; and
               (C) by inserting ``or importation'' after ``carriage''.

Telecommunications deregulation breaks down electronic walls
 
"At one point, the debate veered off on abortion.
 
Seeing a ''high-tech gag rule,'' Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., joined by Pat
Schroeder, D-Colo., and several other women lawmakers, asserted the
anti-pornography provisions would outlaw discussions about abortion over
the Internet, the global computer network.
 
Rep Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a leading abortion foe, assured members that
nothing in the bill suggested any restrictions on discussions about
abortion."
 
Well, Henry Hyde was right - nothing in the bill suggests restrictions on
abortion discussion - the restrictions are in Title 18 of the U.S. Code,
which now includes computer networks.

Yet you don't question anthologies?  I think the Norton Postmodern anthology
is *extremely* guilty of such sampling (and pretty crappy, as anths. go.
Why's it so much skinnier than all the other Nortons?).  It is the *nature*
of anthologies to do this.  One of the (few) problems I had with _Poems for
the Millenium_ was the reprint of only a few scant sections of Mina Loy's
"Love Songs"---which lose a lot yanked out of the piece as a whole.  It
seems to me that the reason professors Xerox is so they can give students a
LARGER sample than anthologies do.  Otherwise, they'd just make us buy an
anthology (certainly they don't go to the trouble of assembling packets to
save us money).

 to bind books, esp. small ones in wch ,amu poems &
small graphics are published these days. The most frequently used methods are
"saddle-stitching" or more properly "saddle-wiring" [staples down the center
of the book's middle gutter crease] & "perfect" binding [that most IMperfect
of bindings]. Stapels are unsightly, liable to rust, & apt to seize up & cut
unwary readers. They also come loose at times, leaving the leaves to their
own devices. Also when put in by "unprofessionals"--even gifted ones-- they
made end up on one side or the toehr of the gutter crease. [Books in an
otherwise excellent current series of chapbooks, beautifully designed & with
a fine group of texts, occasionally have this as their only defect.] Also
stapled books have no spines. So theyre no good to put on shelves unless you
have a very exact memory for such things.
 
Perfect" bindings *do* have spines & no ugly & dangerous staples, but they
fall apart sooner or later--usually sooner. I've been recently reading some
paperbacks in my library, most of which were produced less than 2 decades
ago--some longer ago, but not much. Some have their leaves patherically lying
together within their heavier-paper covers, which are now mere folders.
Others have all or most leaves still fastened to the spine, but as I read
them, mnay or all loosen & separate, no matter how carefully I handle the
books.
 
Some "quality paperbacks"--but by no means all--have signatures that are
side-sewn or side-wired before being glued to the backs. [I doubt that many
are "Smyth-sewn"--sewn down the middle of each signature--a method that
aloows the pages to lie flat.] Such bindings are more nearly permanent than
stapled or perfect bindings. However I know that such types of binding are
costly & raise books' prices unduly.
 
Aren't there *any* better ways to bind books?
 
A publisher of one of my smaller books, of which the other copies are
stapled, had a red thread or string sewn in the center gutter rather than
placing staples there. This *seems* better. However, I'm told that even this
is expensive abd that, unless the string or thread is acid-free or otherwise
made to last, the books fall apart more quickly tahn stapled ones do.
 
As for larger books, are there any inexpensive ways to make their bindings
more nearly permanent--I mean ways other than side-sewn or side-wired or
simple "perfect" [ugh!] bindings? I'd appreciate any information listees may
have on these matters.

Dear Emily Lloyd.
 
It may be that some professors have that desire--but then
why not let students read an entire book? or collection
of writers. Any smaller selection seems to me to help lead
students away from the idea of the book, and the book is
what I am passionately commited to.
 
Moreover, what you suggest has not been my experience, particulary
when professors have asked for permissions to xerox. It's usually
been one or two poems from Stein, or one or two poems from
Hejinian, etc that they've requested.
 
That also wasn't my experience when I was a professor. Most
others were teaching bits and pieces when they created their
own xerox textbooks.
 
I am, quite obviously, not speaking of texts that are
unavailable in book form.
 
I will make no commnets on any anthology. One can only say
that there are no perfect anthologies either, and that, yes,
some do not give students a large enough selection of poetry
to understand any given writer within the context of their
own work or others. That's something I attempted to avoid in
my own anthology.

 Douglas Messerli wrote some things, then Emily Lloyd wrote some things,
then the former wrote later.  Now I'm writing.
 
When looking upon anthologies as a representative work of a collection of
authors, they're pathetically inadequate.
 
However, as a student, anthologies are incredibly useful as representations
of different genre, and i use them as nodes with connections to specific
things that may interest me.  I wouldn't buy any "period" anthology because
i've heard of, say, Stein and that book happens to have three of her poems
in there.  I would , and have gotten books because they put three of
stein's poems (that i may or may not know) in relation to/contrast with
other authors.  And the next step, wait for summer break when I've got some
real free time to read and buy *gasp* whole books by those authors.

Jackson, thanks for the questions on book binding. I certainly don't have
all the answers, but I can make a few points.
 
For single signature pamphlets or chapbooks, I would always recommend sewing
with linen thread rather than staples. The linen thread is usually a natural
color much like the paper, and the process (most commonly three-hole sewing)
is easily learned and actually relatively quickly done. I know that I can
sew a couple of books a minute in this fashion, either pre-punching holes,
or, if there aren't too many sheets in the signature, just punching them
with the needle as I sew. In this way it's not too many hours before an
edition of 300, or even 500, is sewn. I would recommend it to all publishers
of such chapbooks, over stapling. And just do it yourself rather than pay to
have it done. I generally recommend the final knot of the sewing being on
the outside rather than the inside of the book. If anyone wants more
detailed instructions I can give them, or you can pick up various books on
bookbinding. One of the best is Keith Smith's Non-Adhesive Bindings.
 
As for perfect bindings, I agree they're not the best, but you say the books
you have which are coming apart (and I assume that you mean some of the
pages are coming out) are two decades old or less. I am told (but I haven't
tested this) that the techniques for perfect binding have improved even in
the last three years or so, so that the bindings now are much more
long-lasting and secure than they once were. However, there are probably
some printers still using the same equipment and procedures they were using
20 years ago, so, as in so many things, "know your printer and ask them
questions" is good advice.
 
A modified kind of perfect binding, in which notches are cut in the
signatures and glue is shot in, generally called "notch binding," has also
come into vogue. This is an improvement over perfect binding in terms of
strength of the binding and the way the book lays open (but not as flat as
smyth sewing). Some printers now offer "notch binding" and not perfect
binding at all. Thomson-Shore is one of the best of these for short run book
publishers, plus they are perhaps the best printer to work with. They also
offer a great newsletter with lots of info on such binding techniques,
developments in printing, electronic pre-press, etc. They also use only
soy-based inks, which doesn't necessarily mean anything for the reader or
publisher, but makes for a vastly improved working environment for the
workers at the press. Thomson-Shore tends to be a little more expensive than
McNaughton & Gunn or Cushing-Malloy, but some of you might find the service
and the results worth the difference. And sometimes they aren't more
expensive, so it's always good to send them specifications and get
estimates. They are in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and they have a world wide web
site, too, so if you have web access you can find them there.
 
I had a Chax book perfect bound for the first time last year and I was
disappointed in the results, as opposed to all other Chax trade paperbacks
which have been smyth-sewn (but not in terms of anything falling apart). In
this regard I find the expense of smyth sewing worth it. Different presses
charge more or less for this. In my most recent experience, an edition of
500 books produced by Cushing-Malloy in Ann Arbor cost only $75 more to have
smyth sewn than to have perfect bound. I think that is well worth the
difference. Smyth sewing does add a week or so to the production timeline,
as it's something many printers don't do in house.
 
I hope this information helps, and I hope others offer other ideas, as I'm
also always interested to learn about different possibilities from printers
and binders.
 
I'm also acting as an independent broker for one printer here in
Minneapolis, although not one which specializes in book work. But if anyone
has any 2-color to 4-color work and wants one of the best printers in the
midwest to do it, please get in touch with me. I've worked with them on some
very intricate projects, and some very simple projects, and have always been
extremely pleased with the results. Prices are competitive. Sorry for the
shameful commercialism here, although really not ashamed.

Mark -- I'm not certain I understand this. If the wrap around cover has a
single crease (not two creases with a flat "spine" in between) I would still
consider it without spine, by fault or default. So could you describe what
you have done more specifically, either on this list or directly to me at

Ryan, Daniel, & everyone
 
You think the censorship provisions in the Telecommunications bill are
bad enough? Here's what the far right says about it (they're taking the
proto out of protofascist...)
 
(By the way, the AFA does give its phone number at the end of this

TITLE      Computer pornography law not working, says afa

CITATION         PR Newswire, February 14, 1996, Wednesday
SECTION          Washington Dateline
LENGTH           351 words
ABSTRACT         American Family Association issued the following:
              "Less than one week after the Communications Decency Act
was signed into law by President Clinton, it is obvious that the law,
designed to curb computer pornography, is not working and never will
work," said Patrick Trueman, director of American Family Association
governmental affairs.  This fact was made clear by the action this
week of CompuServe, a major access provider to the Internet, to
restore access to pornographic Internet sites it had recently
blocked under pressure from German prosecutors.
            Access providers to the Internet have a financial incentive
to provide access to pornography and they will not block such sites
until they are under a legal obligation to do so, Trueman said.  The
Communications Decency Act included specific provisions protecting
access providers from criminal liability and until those provisions
are repealed, CDA will be nearly useless, he added.
              WASHINGTON, Feb. 14
              Trueman wrote to leaders of pro-family groups today
urging them to unite behind a tough anti-pornography measure like that
sponsored by Congressman Henry Hyde.  The Hyde measure, which would
have made anyone liable who knowingly and intentionally provides
pornography to children or obscene pornography to anyone, was defeated
in committee by supporters of CDA.  "The reality is CDA does not work
and it will never work.  For its enforcement it relies on a massive
number of prosecutions by the Justice Department of individuals who put
illegal pornography on the Internet while the major distributors and
money makers from the distribution of pornography -- the access
providers -- are given a free ride," Trueman said in his letter to
pro-family leaders.
             Trueman urged pro-family leaders to act now to change the
law.
           "There is no point in waiting months or years.  CompuServe
has made that clear in its recent actions which demonstrate that the
law has little, if any, deterrent effect," Trueman said in his letter.

"Poetic Artifice" is also worth noting again: this is V F-T's "Theory of
Twentieth-Century Poetry", published by Manchester Univ. Press, 1978. Her
"Collected Poems and Translations" (Allardyce Barnett 1990) also includes,
as has been noted, "Poetry Such As: An Introduction to the Poetry of Tel
Quel" with translations of Pleynet & Roche. All good things.

Subject:      ROOF voyeurism
 
I've been fascinated at James' little distribution project and the
responses that it has received, although I've been unable to
participate since I already own all those books. But it's a rare moment
really when we get to see different folks' street addresses (there are
some email domains that seem fascinatingly obscure on where in the
world they might be -- it took me forever to realize that Simon was in
Taiwan). It's also fun, frankly, to see who gets what. Does it mean
that they have all the other books on that list? (And, also, why did
James pick those books and not some others?) Remembering what happened
to those poor clueless lawyers in Arizona who advertised their wares on
several usenet groups and got flamed forever until their provider had
to shut down their email in self-defense, it's nice to see how
civilized people on this list really are. But of course we all know how
difficult it is to get small press materials and so are probably
predisposed to feel kindly toward any act of distribution. I know I am.
And having done it a little awkwardly has also made us all conscious
that this is one method that might work well for other publishers,
especially with backlist materials. Are Sun&Moon, Talisman, Chax et al
taking notes?
 
Having said that, let me note that if you don't own Kit Robinson's
_Balance Sheet_ already, you are missing one of the great treats of the
millenium. It's a terrific book (as is true, frankly, for all his
books). He has my vote for most underrated poet of my generation.

Subject:      anthologies
 
Anthologies seem to have a couple of uses.  One is to give a wide
stereoscopic view of a place or time.  The good ones would provide
detailed instructions on access to what's left out.  Technology
seems to open up the possibility of "live anthologies" with endless
branches and channels to obscure connections, changing the "canon"
question some.
 
Another use is how they participate in what Montale called the"second
life of art".  Old anthologies sort of seep into the ground & become
part of the landscape & then affect people in unexpected, "secondary"
ways (this is not exactly what Montale had in mind, but close).
I'm thinking of Pound finding or using an old anthology of English
poetry while in the prison camp in Italy (one of the few bks
available to him).  Or how one of those Untermeyer anthologies
of British poetry changed Brodsky's career.
 
The school use of anthologies is - oh, well, school... - Henry Gould

douglas--okay.  We've had different experiences, that's all.  Maybe my profs
are particularly conscientious (George Mason U. & Oberlin--you heard it here
first).  Maybe the profs who've requested xeroxes from Sun & Moon texts
weren't writers themselves.  Clearly (I think), writers are going to be
concerned with preserving the idea of the book--I believe mine have been.
 
I certainly do think that xeroxing can become an abused privilege---like
preying on texts (and writers, and anthologizers).  On the other hand, the
power of the anthologizer is something I don't mind calling into question.
Who goes in, and what of theirs goes in.  When only a few anthologies
dealing with a certain school or genre are available, the anthologizer has
immense responsibility & power.  Who decides what "postmodern poetry,"
"poetry of witness," "queer poetry" looks like?---especially since
anthologies are often used in undergrad situations where the folks reading
them aren't necessarily interested in poetry & will look no further than the
anthology.  At best, xeroxing & distributing your own packets is a stance
against canonization & systematic exclusion.
 
Hoping for the best,

The Poetics response in just one day has been fantastic. Many of you have
already ordered and as I sit typing here, poets are sending messages to
request books. I will give you a report in a couple of weeks so you can
all know what has been ordered.
 
And of course new special offers will be showing up from time to time.
 
Several questions have arisen which I did not deal with in the original
offer. Here are the answers:
 
1. Yes, please send all orders to: jsherry@panix.com
2. Overseas orders will be charged $6 / book.
3. Overseas orders may use INternational Money Order or check, BUT
4. All orders must be paid in US dollars ($US).
 
Obviously there may still be more issues outstanding; just let me know.
 
And keep those backchannel messages coming.

Subject:      roof books, copies, internet etc...
 
as to the book offer:  i replied, as james seemed to ask, to the
list---albeit with some hesitancy... but after i thought about it some, and
noted james' remark about whether the internet works or don't, it seemed
and still seems to me that (just this once) it'd be interesting to actually
see the level of response around here to a book sale... so i'm with ron's
"voyeurism" on this one, i find it fascinating to see this sorta thing
actually work (albeit i can understand why dodie finds this "rude")...
 
anyway, douglas m.:  when you write "why not let students read an entire
book?" (a sentiment with which i wholeheartedly concur) there is yet to be
asked the overarching question of student economies (as eryque indicates,
"in debt")... i mean, to pick at your rhetoric a bit, "let" is not quite
the appropriate operator... i simply can't ask my students to go out and
buy everything i think they should read... further, i'm hampered by a
terrible library situation (no english journals, just for starters)... and
the avg. family income of the students on my campus is around $40k...
 
so when i make copies for my students, i feel i'm doing them a favor... for
me the copy machine represents a breakthrough technology in productively
breaking the law... i most def. DON'T feel i'm decontextualizing the work,
in part b/c i try to account for this through discussion, selected
historical materials, etc... and my own books even... and yeah, anthologies
(such as yours, or paul hoover's norton---which latter i'm currently
trying) can help, albeit they're all to be regarded imnsho as partial
*selections*... in fact i've asked my students this semester to each go out
and buy one small press book of poetry (this in addition to the norton and
two other books)...
 
i like what---who was it? sheila?---said about this---that in effect
there's still the matter of how to make poetry pay... for the time being i
would argue that electronic technologies in general---copy machines, www,
etc.---may be used to build up a market demand for poetry... and that
mebbe, over time, poets might be able to expect some real income from their
pursuit... i'm suggesting that there's a market potential here, and the
question then would seem to turn to how to exploit same without Exploiting
same?...
 
but if poetry publishers like yourself are gonna rush to argue against such
"illegal" distribution activities (i'm being provocative, douglas) as
copying for educational purposes (and don't we all do this for *ourselves*
anyway?), why then methinks this will keep poetry in its current
market-place, with correspondingly little "value" in the public domain...
it may be too much to ask that poetry become some sort of national pastime,
but at the same time it could surely stand all the help it can get in terms
of public relations (i'm reminded, btw, of just how successful the new
critics were in such terms---which can *always* result in Bad Politics)...
we're just not going to avoid an economic discussion of poetry anymore than
we're going to avoid an economic discussion of the internet...
 
so perhaps what we need are new economies of scale, predicated on a merging
of gift/barter/sales economies... i mean, something like james sherry's
book offer, active trading of books on the parts of poets themselves, an
occasional giveaway, regular ole buy & sell, used stuff, etc... i mean, how
to do this and create---dare i say it?---a livelihood of sorts for those
who love to write, to live off of what they love... yeah, ok,
parasitically, if need be...

In-Reply-To:  <199602160109.UAA11644@emout05.mail.aol.com>
 
disappointed at comments made by Jackson Mac Low recently
and with an eye for the shameless promotion of Meow Press (now
that it's in vogue here on the list)--let me respond to the comments
about book binding and production. First of all, I am a publisher, book
artist, whathaveyou, who uses unsightly staples for a variety of reasons
and I take JML's words as a critique of works I sent him (which is
saything nothing of what he thought of the writing by Charles Bernsetin,
James Sherry, and other authors some of whom subscribe to this list):
 
> "saddle-stitching" or more properly "saddle-wiring" [staples down the center

My saddle stapler barely works! I have to give it a backrub just to keep
working smoothly! I've not yethad one rust, but it is a drag to buy a
book like that in a usedbook store. As far as letting the leaves "to
their own devices"--I'm reminded of Juliana Spahr's Leave Books--a model
for my own program--and the idea that the leaves might flutter away on
their own, well, what a beautiful image! I think of the scholars who'll
be confused by a book that was falling apart or made to dissolve in time...
 
The problem of teh "gutter crease" is one that I take quite seriously and
can only say that I know the difference but that a recent assistant to the
assembly of these books doesn't yet. My training of him has covered
"stapling" (and its icky uncle Folding) but this helper to the process
is an unprofessional in that it is important to him to get the books out
and he is coming at it from a perspective of an urgent necessity to make
these things available, not the fine craft of the book arts. I will bring
it up later when we have a meeting to discuss the direction of Meow Press.
 
On the other hand, what are we doing here? We are making books to hand
over to people in the community. Only recently have we contacted
libraries to see if they are interested (apparently they are not) and
obviously bookstores dont work. Not simply because of the spine-problem,
but because very few bookstores know how to develop a section such as it
requires to bring people in and get them interested. I worked for a while
at Borders store and am committed to community booksellers like Talking
Leaves in Buffalo. They display our books nicely there and seem to want
to have whatever we make. In August it will have been three years and
almost thirty books. If I wasn't in school or had lots of money or rich
friends (apparently none of my friends are rich!) then _time_ and _labor_
wouldn't be a factor. I agree that sewing chapbooks is better. But this
is an industrial society! I have partipated in capitalism by trying to
hurry up and staple books quickly so I can get back to my studies!
 
C'mon. I guess I have been hanging out with too many poets here in
Buffalo. I used to hang out with punk rockers and from them I learned a
kind of nihilism that's postive in that I'm not making books to last for
the archive, but for now and literally for tomorrow--not next year. Peter
Gizzi once complained that the carbon-transfer process common among lazer
printers, and photocopiers,etc., was too impermanent. The idea of the
words eventually falling off the pages was exciting to me when I started
Meow Press and only now do I have fantasies of making "real books" like
Roof and Chax,Sun&Moon etc. But it wouldn't be happening at all if I
couldn't staple them at home on a "stolen" saddle stapler. I receive
some support from Poetics Program at SUNY Buffalo--about enough to do one
good size book in paperback with single-color cover in an edition of 750
or 1000 (depending, yes, on where it is printed!). I wouldn'tknow which
book to pick! There are many projects I would like to support and doing
chapbooks in runs of 300 is one way that I can. So instead, this project
was designed to be close to the ground, publishing about 10 chapbooks a
year and adding now to that a new "ephemera series" of super-limited
edition chapbooks--of short length (10-20 pages)--which will enable us to
do another ten or so books a year. The ephemera books will not be listed
in the catalog and will be made available to friends of the press and as free
giveaways (in the original spirit of Meow Pres).
 
As far as Jackson's complaint that staples are dangerous and might cut
you--I can only hope that no one has ever been seriously injured reading
one of my books.

Three cheers for Joel Kuszai, Kuszai Press, and the book as impermanent
object. Actually, the works Joel produces will survive as texts one way or
another, and I think Meow books have a beauty and charm all their own. While
I practice and teach certain bookmaking methods, I applaud what all small
press publishers are doing. I often regret that Chax books are not as
immediate as Meow, Leave and others, in part because of the means of
production and in part because of the cost of production. And some of the
greatest treasures in my own library are stapled pamphlets, whether the
staples used are rust-proof, stainless ones or not. That they may not last
my lifetime is something I know going into it. That they are worthy and
exciting to boot is my great pleasure.

Subject:      Re: Douglas: (C) up for grabs
 
Emily,
 
Thanks for your intelligent response. Of course, as I mentioned yesterday,
I am not at all against xeroxing (I did the same as a university professor)
materials that are not readily available. That "extends" the literary
experience. And, believe me, I know all the difficulties of anthologies--
my introduction to FROM THE OTHER SIDE outlines some of those very issues.
 
But in all my 20 years of publishing Sun & Moon, not one professor (and
many have been authors themselves) has requested permission to reprint MORE
of, say, Djuna Barnes for instance. The requests have always been for
little sections and parts of things, which does lead me to believe that the
students are learning bits and pieces of literary texts as opposed to
experiencing complete works. That's what I meant by the pedagogical
problems I perceive. It's very much the kind of problem that has faced
Gertrude Stein all these years: parts of works or "collections" of her
work have appeared, but there has been no sense, until recently, of Stein
authoring books (THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF ALICE B. TOKLAS and THREE LIVES
being the obvious exceptions), and I think that is one of the major
reasons why Stein was not recognized as one of the central literary
figures of the century. It was certainly true for Barnes, who, until my
bibliography appeared, was perceived as a one-novel writer.
 
Finally I have no argument against professors or creative writing teachers
creating their own versions of literary experience and attempting to
establish their own canons. That can be healthy. What does disturb
me is that they don't pay the authors for doing that. Sun & Moon pays
royalties to its own authors for sale of their books and pays for the
rights to reprint other poets. So the authors are receiving something
for their writing. By xeroxing the author is completely left out of
the process -- and, in my experience, the books are often ignored in
the classroom (which is one the major sources of potential revenue for
the author and a press like Sun & Moon). It's certainly true that an
enlightened student or two may eventually go out and purchase the book,
but the other 10 or 20 students in that classroom, not so enlightened,
will have no idea of what the experience of the book is about.
 
I might add one final note: the books I bought for my courses (and in my
undergraduate days we were expected to read about 15-30 books in each
literature course) began a home library that has served me as a resource
ever since. Had my teachers xeroxed all my reading material, I believe
I'd not have the same relationship with literature itself. And certainly
I would not been encouraged to spend my last dime each month on books.
 
Well, I think I've had my say on this. I just thought it is important than
a publisher speak on this subject as well. While it's certainly true that
poets don't receive much money from their writing, anthology appearances
and book royalties do result in some payment. And even if this is
symbolic--and it's often more than that--it's crucial if we are to
recognize writng as a true occupation in our society.

tha's a tremendous idea joe, hope others might also.  do you give a
list to choose frm?  do they report back to you (or better, to the
class) on their individual selctions?  wd be interested fr a report
on what they choose...  & next time, you might consider adding one
small press magazine aswellas a book...
 
fr what it's worth, yr welcome to photocopy any single issue of
TRR in its entire for yr class; easier still, i'd donate copies
fr the price of postage (abt $5/20 copies) fr free distribute to
students...  which would go fr anyone else on th list, as long as
resources hold up (backchannel requests, please)...  get the words

I'm not sure how one can escape from an old hat if one is a slowpoke, but I
see your point.  This may be my own extrapolation, because D & G leave it
unspoken, but I don't see a necessary contradiction between these two views
of the artist.  It's just that absorbing/responding to/synthesizing
conventions and their contents becomes after a certain point a) boring and
b)useless, and one wants something else to work with.  The only place to go
for this is the chaos at the edges of thought, hence artist as destroyer
(or, perhaps more accurately, traveller out) of convention.  They're two
very different modes, but not mutually exclusive by any means, and in fact I
wonder how long the artist can *sustain* eir fruitful working relation to
the world if one or the other mode is neglected.

for relatively small editions, various forms of japanese bindings
might be a good alternative.  takes a bit longer than handstitching
a pamphlet bound book, but still feasable fr runs a couple hundred.
traditional japanese bindings don't have a spine like conventional
western books, but you can add an outside cover w/ titled spine
if you want.  kojiro ikegami's _Japanese Book-binding_ (weatherhill
1986) is one of the best introductions.

Poe/Eliot/Plath under the sign of metonymy : she finds in all three
an overwhelming alienation from lost past lived experience; a sense
of tradition as imposing, foreign burden; and a sense of language as
a suicidal or proto-suicidal dead end - the word as emblem, reductive
metonymy of experience.  Thus their ironic, sing-song formalism,
self-defeating.
    I  bring this up as example of approach in which the two poles
of art endeavor (synthesis/iconoclasm) which you mentioned are
both combined and incredibly conflicted.

I want to add a fourth & a fifth cheer for Joel Kuszai and a warning that if
we forget the value of impermanence and "poor art" etc. we will be sacrificing
one of the great weapons given us to thwart a marketplace mentality that
would finally deny us free means to what we have to say.  The tradition
represented here goes back to magnificent poor works of Russian Futurists
and others using cheap paper and rubber stamps and hand scrawls and carries
on thru American mimeo revolutions and Soviet typewritten samizdat work.
These works are beautiful for themselves and for the hope that they hold out
to all of us, that there are ways still to escape the money bind.  It is
embedded also, deeply embedded in the work & prophecy of Schwitters, say,
whom all of us love dearly.  I have thrilled to rich & lavish printings also,
but I'd swear too that the real work is elsewhere.

told them to hold off for a bit, till after we've had a chance to explore
some of the various poets in the norton, and others that i bring in on the
fly... i'm trying to get them each to flesh out their own
aesthetics/poetics predilections... i don't have any english majors at iit,
most of these folks are engineering/science majors who're bored with the
humdrum, passive/receiver sorts of instruction they're regularly exposed
to... i like the poetry mag. idea too... i do bring in journals i have
subscriptions to and have 'em browse through... and i copy class
participants on poetics posts as i can, esp. those that are descriptive in
nature or point to new web sites, such as the new sun & moon site (i've set
up a temporary elist for the class, and i require electronic journals once
a month based on net surfing/browsing---i provide an initial list of sites,
which includes epc)...
 
in all, i'm trying to get the class into the flow through sheer immersion,
and i try to provide some guidance as things get productively messy...  and
b/c there's no cost entailed in net surfing (at least, if folks use the iit
computers, which are finally getting up to speed wrt netscape etc.) it's
easiest to get the class interested in contemporary poetry/poetics through
the web, through the present-ness of online writings... i also try to

in all, the economics of publishing is very much a part of this "workshop,"
if indeed it IS a workshop in any traditional sense... i'm really stressing
reading and responding to reading every bit as much as 'creative
writing'... b/c to nurture doing one in the absence of the other (which is
what most of these folks HAVE been doing) seems to me to yield little other
than aesthetic posing... albeit i like to leave room for sheer inspiration,

In response to several backchannel requests: I can't take orders directly for
this anthology from outside the UK, unless you're able to pay in sterling.
Dollar cheques, for instance, cost me an arm & a leg to convert, and
international money orders would cost you an arm & a leg.
 
So the answer, folks in the USA and Canada, is to order from SPD or Marginal

Also: didn't I say? the book is published by Reality Street Editions, the press

This is Dodie Bellamy, who reads the list but is not signed up for it (KK
is), and from that borderline position I now speak.
 
I've talked to at least a half a dozen people who have quit the list (all
of whom are more "established" writers) not in disgust exactly but because
they found the level of discussion uninteresting and inane--I think the
Renga saga started frustrating many people.  The people I know who have
quit the list have lives which allow all the intellectualy stimulation they
could want.  Not everyone is in that situation, and a public forum like
this is vital to them--they're probably more willing to put up with any
flaws they might perceive in the proceedings.  I think any time you have a
public forum, things do tend to slip to the lowest common denominator.
(That's why I hate group process.  Whenever I've been asked to serve on the
board of an organization, for instance, I've said, "No, I hate group
process.")  Eryque Gleason recently sent me a portion of the online
discussion from his undergraduate workshop with Pierre Jorris at Albany,
and I found these undergraduates discussing what it means to write a
manifesto much more engaging than what I read on the poetics list.  But I
think that's because the Albany discussion is coming out of a defined
community with more of a shared project.
 
I don't think that intellectual stringency in and of itself is a
particularly positive experience.  Here in the Bay Area, in the 80s at
least, the intellectual standards became so high that many people felt the
humanity had dropped out of the scene.  Once readings became known as
"literary events," these "events" often had an aura of stress and
alienation rather than communication.  Things have soften greatly in San
Francisco, and maybe we've lower our standards, but it feels good to go to
"events" and feel some warmth.

     At the risk of still coming off GLIB (I resemble that!)
     let me just say that though it WAS a useful and valuable experience
     teaching from your anthology, I also realize that in the course of a
     semester undergraduate introduction to poetry course that ultimately
     less than 10% of the PAGE COUNT of the book was utilized in the class
     (and granted students may do "further reading" outside of the class;
      but many students simply sold the books used back to the bookstore)--
     The point I'm trying to make (and maybe this relates to JONATHON
     LEVIN's "poetry and the cirriculum" panel) is that when I teach the
     dense and complex work in avant-garde (and even in some mainstream)
     anthologies, I tend to want to focus on DEPTH rather than BREADTH....
     In other words, we spent two hours on ONE WIENERS poem in the anthology--
     at least 4 hours on ONE ASHBERY poem in the anthology....
     a whole week on Harryman; another whole week on spicer....
     etc. etc.----this may seem like piecemail reading according to your

"Against" what?  Photocopy places?  The only poems of mine ever printed were
printed at Kinko's.  I'm all for 'em.
 
However, if I signed a contract with a publisher and my income was dependent on
royalties that were largely derived from custom publishing and photocopy
reproductions of my work (I'm not thinking exclusively of poets here) then I
would be quite upset that someone sought to make money from my work without
sharing the profits with me.
 
If you photocopy poems for the classroom that were printed with a small press,
then maybe everyone could benefit.  Students read poems, press & poet(s) get
exposure, etc.  If you photocopy large portions of say, a chemistry text
written for classroom use and reduce a significant amount of sales from a
publisher, then you are taking bread from a writer's mouth, or more likely, an
extra condo on the beach from a professor's assets.
 
Either way, as someone pointed out earlier, "that doesn't change the fact that
I still don't have a car." (Bueller.)

Subject:      as one person who talks a lot
 
Thinking about Jeff Hansen's request for a bibliography of Ron Silliman's
work.. I mean for a discussion of eroticism and L poetry, it occurs to me
that the discussion of L poetry among L-influenced writers (and L-poets
themselves) usually centers (yes, centers) around perceived deficiencies in
the L-program. L-poets don't do the quotidian, L-poets aren't erotic,
L-poets don't have subject matter... You know the tone. And it's a fine
tone to take, I might add, except that it's rhapsodizing on the theme of
critique instead of analyzing what's there. That is, it's the strategy that
the L-poets are best prepared to repel. Or, as Ron Silliman once said,
"What is a positive definition." I'd like to see an assessment for 1996 of
what the proficiencies of L-poetry are, and what we can expect in the next
four years from L-poets and their happy progeny, the M-poets. This is not a
challenge, or a sneaky attempt to flush the L-poets out where we can see
them, just one person who types maybe too much trying to make it up to
people who listen.

I wasn't trying to dismiss the slowpokes.  I was responding to your use of
the phrase "old hat", which I take to mean "out of fashion" just as
"avant-garde" carries a meaning (sometimes the  only meaning intended) "soon
to be in fashion."  My point was, if we look at it from the standpoint of
fashion, the slowpokes are just as susceptible to becoming old hat.  Which
isn't really interesting.  Which is why I was glad you rephrased and said
"over-emphasized"--much more interesting.
 
Good examples of the conflict the position I was referring to can put one
in--Poe, Eliot, Plath.  I tend to agree.

Maybe it is time for poets to start some intelligent
transvaluations, and protect the already exiguous (or scantly
existent) readership we have from the profiteering of the
foreign exchanges.
 
Internet itself may soon be the answer, the currencyless
transaction of texts from land to land.
 
But in the meantime, we should steal a march on those
Maastricht lads and their ECUs and so forth, and establish,
herewith, a Universal Poetry Unit, good for any small press
book published in the world.  Or such books to be priced in
units of such a 'currency'

Dear Ron and all else:
        Yeah, the thing is snow balling in the way wrong/right direction,
though I just read today that, not only is the censorship idea flying
well w/ Compuserve, but a court in Philly has already dumped the
anti-pornography stuff as unconstitutional (or something to that effect;
our papers out here mostly suck and I was in a hurry, too).
        Anyway, what I did was email the pres. and my senators and all
the fairly local house rep's. and let them know they should back end the
whole idea of access-limitation if they're gonna do anything at all: it
wouldn't be hard, I imagine, for any server company to develop some
simple technology to allow INDIVICUAL USERS the ability to screen out
certain sites, etc. This would still allow people to choose for
themselves, though of course that's exactly what the AFA et al would like
to avoid, or, really, prevent.

Henry,
and this will be my last post today,
an M poet
(known before Maastricht as a G2, or Star Trek The Next Generation poet)
is a poet whose concerns are loosely affiliated with the critique of meaning
as a possibility for lyric poetry
and is called an M poet
to publicize the roughly square magazine Apex of the M
as L poets were called L poets
to publicize the magazine called L+A+N+G+U+A+G=E

yay ron!
 
I just got to Albany, and hear that one of the few bookstores for small
press stuff (who at least know how to find it if they don't carry it) is
succumbing to the Borders.  So I'm particularly grateful for the ease of
ordering from ROOF, especially at this incredible price!  If anyone else
wishes to support my small pocket book, i'll be sure to give what support
my pocket book (and bookshelf, which gets smaller everytime i move) can
handle.

I usually appreciate this approach to a poetry course (or any other for
that matter).  It seems the result of digging DEEP(ish) into a few poets
(or poems) in a semester is much greater retention, both of the work
studied but whatever associative works are brought up.  The engineering
students that I mentioned in my earlier post about a class w/ andy levy
(some of the very same people joe amato is teaching now) certainly remember
more about stein and w.c. williams (tender buttons and spring and all were
taught together back-to-back) and various others that were brought up than
they would've if the syllabus had called for a broad overview of the
period, picking one or two pieces by each.
 
 
since it's come up obliquely:  a while back someone (Loss?) mentioned that
some people left the list because of the deluge of renga posts.  Dodie
mentioned the online discussions we have in Pierre Joris' workshop.
 
As kind of an ice breaker, i started a renga thread, but I've started
calling it "rupert" rather than renga since it's a free-form collaborative
piece with no other rules.  i didn't want to contribute to western
bastardization of original forms any more than i had to.  anyone seen the
new indoor soccer league?  They've got a three point arc for chrissake!
 
It's too dark in Albany right now to actually be whited (whitten?) out.

      I think an Mpoet is somewhere between an Lpoet and an Npoet,
unless I miss my mark, which is dandy and fine, but the question is
after the Zpoets have their heyday will we finally recognize the
importance of the AApoets who have been so important all along?
 
 but, not seriously, I had the idea a while ago what with all the
problems of naming our movements [what with "new critics" and
"postmodern" susceptible to time factors] that literary movements
should be named like the National Weather service names Hurricanes,
alphabetically, one year Male, one year female--or maybe we could make
all the names androgynollogous, or maybe not.

Here's a short poem, for all you eye-blitzed people fed up with me.
The key to this poem is the letter ... S.
 
                      *
 
Time now for the trees to shroud the earth, time
when the wind dies down,
and over the still mirror
a faded voice is whispering.
 
Time again to climb into the old
music-box in the forest,
and wind the iron spring--
 
it is letter by letter,
line by line.

The Wobblies here may be getting involved in something called LETsystem,
which a sort of bartering system where you barter for points rather than
things or services, so that someone could owe a bunch of points and pay
them back, not to the person ze directly owed but maybe to some
completely different persons.  I will certainly suggest sapphos as the
currency.  Sounds great to me.  :-)  Gab.

Subject:      Re: Bloody Staples
 
The idea of books as permanent has something to do with our human sense
of time. I do have some volumes from the early 19th century that are in
reasonably decent shape, but overall books do age. I find that I
respond to each very differently according to how I feel about the
book.
 
The paper in my copy of _The Hotel Wently Poems_ is so acidic that I'm
surprised it doesn't combust spontaneously, though the staples that
bind it (pure rust after 38 years) seem to have done very little
damage. Gradually as those pages darken, the poems will disappear into
the darkening grain. Yet I find that Wieners' most satisfying book and
have long looked on that process as a living part of those poems.
 
On the other hand, I find it very depressing to realize that the glue
in my copy of _Roots and Branches_ is dissolving. I think I must have
had a sense of that book as permanent -- it is still probably my
favorite single book of all time -- and find its aging process more
alarming.
 
As for staples, I'd worry more about tetanus than bleeding to death.

   Eryque---thanks for your reply, and i don't disagree with you perse
   (and if i get to teach again some day I may even teach full books by
    single poets---and yes even SUN AND MOON poets perhaps dug not to be GLIB!)
    but the point I was trying to make is different, and I still think
    maligned. It's the point that one poem---even a short 12 line one--
    can be as useful of a "site" (sorry, too much academic theory in me head)
    for a classroom discussion, and may tell us more about both "poetry"
    and "language" and "the poet" and "the real world" than a huge
    voluminous book---sometimes less is more, macrocosm in the microcosm, etc-
    and sometimes more is less----
    and as Barthes wrote somewhere "rereading is something that goes against
    the ideological and commercial habits of our society" or something to
    that effect (i think in S/z; and maybe certain people would call Barthes
    glib too)..........best, cs.

Sorry to take so long to get back on this - lots to read!
 
The wrap around covers did have 2 creases and publication details were
printed on them. I produced a magazine called P76 (which is still sort of
going but not in the same format) which consisted of a hundred or so
(gestnered then later photocopied) A4 pages with plain board covers side
stapled. A silk screened wrap around cover complete with spine made the mag
stand out on bookshelf shelves. I must admit I got this idea from another
oz magazine called MAGIC SAM which came out in the late 70s and early 80s.
Other oz publishers also used wrap around covers more conventionally -
Rigmarole & Sea Crusie come to mind.

One certainly doesn't want the small presses to go out of bizness,
tho except in cases where the poets also run the presses, it's hard
to see them loosing out.  But there is a loss to all of us if the
texts aren't available in stores(or even in libraries / to photocopy),
as increasingly they aren't.
 
Setting aside the harm to presses, the custom made xerox pack, complete
with rusty staples seems to give the poems more context than the
anthology.  At least there is the implication of a larger world.
 
But who wrote of 'allowing' students to buy whole books, encouraging
one to spend the last dime each month at the bookstore.  Reminds me
of the psychoanalytic custom of requiring the patient to pay 'something'
as part of the therapy.

WHAT SOUND A WALL
 
For Larry Eigner
_________________________________________________________
 
walls, soundless, are stable, allow the application of pressure as swallows
reflect sound
 
where you think of what a wall is. How it reflects. How its position swounds
an acoustic
 
however auditory acrostic of stunned steps from the straits of its
audiational vista
 
bay is a bowl the geographic sun room's horticulture not hormuz how zounds leads
 
is the wall that stands outside which sends windows sounds "The Music, The
Rooms"
 
in "silence silence silence silence sound" where sound only capable amid the
profusion
 
of wounds. Silence marks the beat, its time, makes sounds possible within
the noise
 
of whitespace caterwauling when insisted marking to side is what words spark
remark
 
"on the walls" sustain. On both sides, whether the push outside punctuates birds
 
its conscious present of paper cosmos whether "times advance" ie tides,
ties, pools
 
or manmade poles, pinpoints, power ... "with desperate ease" sees color's
infrared
 
light also from a punctuation of circling, "the food, the power" inside its
simple strait
 
plunge which is the food and the powder, torpid "tropic" for fleck, as light
is a speck
 
or inspect how birds themselves circle before blunting, plunging, plageant
"pinpoint"
 
"how distance is to some birds" simply said how IS distance to some? Is any
distance
 
possible when circling--no distance--leads to food? The answer that such
distance is the
 
"pinpoint"--the sun point, the pole from perspective of bird's sky view,
"back up" its cries
 
"the meaning of change" is in a change of rooms. This is information itself,
which room
 
and which side is outside (or "so the words go up/ into thin air" how "the
parlor" pauses
 
"the speaking" only existing against the parlor and MADE POSSIBLE by a
physical pause
 
as this pause leads to "room". Room for pause and the pause which makes room
 
place once inside. There windowed against the spoken pause musical parlor
under skies
 
skies hold mutable pause midwing "birds pass the window" pause "the curves
together")
 
sound only plays against its instrument (forgotten) "on the screen" "the
clock shakes out"
 
as is player piano--a scroll of white of "silence silence silence silence
sound" where sound
 
only capable amid the profusion of wounds--the punctuations as punctures the
scroll
 
makes room for. The player piano is an instrument forgotten of silence which
produces
 
sound song written as if through a wall which pauses sense of sound. Elsewise
 
a vase for precarious things "a live broadcast" indeed when marks behind screen
 
which mars sounds themselves how ... circling ... how silence is to some birds.

"wampum gulls broke shells" determine rhythm insist sound defines--beyond walls
 
"directed" how to eyes, Africa, dogs, hair bleach, and scurvy roll off five
such beats
 
between pivots that pinpoint bikes sea sights voyage the studio that spins
dark strife
 
how did those gulls break shells? as "they might" dive "headlong into"
spells? how
 
is wampum also shells and broke also without wampum but moreso there are not
 
things here: the currency of the letter in stuttering conjunction of zounds
("wonder
 
and astonishment") and swounds (wound + swoons)--falling from the sky, mating--
 
in the hand but distant "how distance is to some birds" is "the dim
expanding miles"
 
see sea saw as white white white white light holds steady "they might drive
headlong"
 
as headlights hound the wall of sight:
 
                        a steady white light
 
                             they might drive headlong into
 
                                the mist like a magnet
 
                             blows     lost bearings

The magnet is a pivot and the pivot is the space on the wall its attractive
drawn
 
magnetism as physical as the pull between 'they might drive like a magnet' and
 
'the mist blows like a magnet'. The pull creates the space which is the
magnet that
 
"blows    lost bearings" next, of course rest. Sounds come from rests which next
 
"nest in fisherman's pocket"--nets contains the same letters as nest--as
nets which
 
sent tens the magnet of a pocket. An afterword note describes Pokagan the
note itself
 
as much SHAPE as lexical value. As words, trace of magnet drawn across
glass, scores
 
flight of pigeons across "nuggets of sound carving space" (cb) storm craving
place
 
how the birds sound there--in is in all cases sound there "commingling", mix of
 
> "geometry of ties that blind in music" (cb) "What sound for our ears"
 
sleigh of ear bells and thundering of encroaching charm. The birds as charm of
 
sound's astonished sense fluttering "all about me; gently" an onset as extinct
 
however never more vivid than in Pokagan's description--brought even more
 
to vivacity against a wall, with the screen and its "live performance" which
is less
 
                                pivot          spun
 
                              sERK Life
 
                        irises*
 
                        ----------------------------------------------
 
                        *headlights, sights, "a steady white light"
 
how you would "carefully concealed them under my blanket" why and what is the
 
blanket? Simply the silence that makes sound possible only as an outline in
its furls.
 
Words are present passing as they did "like a cloud through the branches of
the high
 
trees"--the driving "headlong into / the mist"--that is this blanketing
action where a
 
plane lengthens through fog / or cloud bends away / the curves together--the
largest
 
or smallest action may have immense MASS though it's not a mass dependent on
size or
 
bulk but a mass which takes its form from its immediate position in a
spectrum of activity
 
where pages ARE on the page, where places are, or objects are inside a plane
or outside.
 
Whether circling, plunging--but always dependent on its relation. Indeed,
where is the bird
 
when it is raining? Just as what is a sound without a wall, window, or
objects for its
 
reflection? Its sounding without mass but there..."a bird / depending on the
weather"

Hey Jordan Davis--I'd watch out, if I were you, of making the claim
(even ironically) that the
Apex of the M poets are the main next generation inheritors of language
writing--someone who's not paying attention might actually think such a
comment should be taken as true.
 
I think it's pretty clear that while language writing has certainly had a
broad influence on "avant garde" writers emerging in the aftermath of
their success, the Apex of the M crowd is only one of a multitude of
directions in which that influence has been taken. And, frankly, it seems
that the Apex context has been more influenced by a religious (and even
sometime directly transcendentalist) strain in innovative American poetry
that comes more from Duncan, the Waldrops, John Taggert, etc., than from
the rather completely non-transcendentalist implications of language
writing. Remember--the Apex manifestos pretty much reject the value of
language writing except as a series of theoretical insights that (Apex
claims) has not really produced much poetry of value.

Dear Kenneth Sherwood,
 
Don't know who you are, and feel I really needn't
repond, but your comments really do confuse me:
 
1. What does a poet running a press have to do with
"losing"--or winning, for that matter? And what does
that have to do with the issue of xeroxing books?
 
2. Our books (that is, Sun & Moon books--which you seem
be referring to) are available to most US and English
bookstores. They are readily available for use in
classrooms and we have excellent distribution. But are you
suggesting that smaller presses, who havent' been able
to obtain such good distribution, ought to be punished
by having their books xeroxed?
 
3. I said nothing about "allowing" a student anything.
I spoke from my own experience of wanting/desiring to purchase
books--even when I had little money. I saw that as positive
(for myself). Perhaps you don't. But I hardly understand your
analogy to a "psychoanalytic custom."  I don't see the connection.
And you suggesting that pscychologists shouldn't be paid?
 
Well I truly have had my say on this. I do feel poets ought to
receive money for their books, and I feel literary presses should be
supported by a community supposedly interested in poetry. Indee,
I feel we ARE supported by that community. And I appreciate it.
Obviously, not everyone will agree.

And now, Brownie McGhee has died -- another good friend to poets
everywhere -- appeared memorably in Langston Hughes's _Simply Heaven_
years ago -- KLON just ran a one hour tribute, and Taj Mahal, who
happened to be in for an interview, played some of the most moving guitar
I've ever heard from him, remembering McGhee.  Look up some of the old
photos of Brownie and Sonny playing around the Village during the Weavers
& Woody era --

Dear Douglass:
 
Poets AND psychoanalysts should both get paid.  Poets don't, generally
speaking.  They don't benefit substantially from royalties.
What they gain from a press is the distribution of their work, and
access to the work of others important to them.  Has *any*
poet worth her or his salt *ever* made enough money from it to live?
What if we discount court patronage and university tenure?  I suspect
even the Sun&Moon stars make more for one poetry reading than a year
of royalties.
 
My post, you will note was not meant as personal attack,
nor was it an attack on the activites of Sun & Moon.  It was neither
meant to intimate that 'poets running presses' get rich skimming
off the top, nor that they don't pay their poets all due royalites.
I'm sure you or Charles Alexander or James Sherry can verify this.
 
But it was meant to suggest that poetry represents a special case,
economically and otherwise, in relation to the general question of
copyright.  Poets as a rule don't live off royalties, simply put.
 
What poets do is spend money on books.  (Please James, I'm good
for the 30 buck, send me _Islets/Irritations_.)  And since I'm
revealing private details, well . . . I was forced to build a
new bookshelf this past summer.  So I too am concerned with the
support of the literary.
 
So for the poets at least, the whole thing seems a losing proposition,
economically, which is perhaps why I'm interested in electronic publishing--
one way of avoiding 'some' of the problems associated with the poetry
market.  Rif/t and the EPC don't pay royalties, but we don't have to
charge readers either.
 
I do see it as a loss when poetry texts aren't available. (Anyone
have a copy of Mina Loy's _Last Lunar_ they'd give up?  Anyone know
how to secure the rights of some long-dead poet, say Else Von Freytag
Lorignhoven, to republish?  Gee, I thought copyright was supposed to
help us.)
 
Given the value of small press activites, I still don't want to
FETISHIZE the PURCHASING of books.  That, perhaps, is what
I should have said initially--I'm feeling more cogent today.
And that is perhaps why I thought of the psychoanalytic principle
that a patient must pay something, no matter how poor they are or
how little they can afford, in exchange for their therapy.  This
'payment' is part of the treatment, even when the sum might
be insignificant to the psychoanalyst.
 
My relationship to poetry feels secure, even without such a ritual
binding. Douglass, I have the advantage in this exchange of having
met you, having heard you read, and owning some 15 or 20 books
published/edited by you here on the shelf. I'm sure not paying
your light bill, but I do what I can.
 
Best,
 
Ken Sherwood

Both sides of the Douglas/Kenneth discussion are well worth pondering,
but this quote of Kenneth's is what provokes me today:
 
>I do see it as a loss when poetry texts aren't available. (Anyone
>have a copy of Mina Loy's _Last Lunar_ they'd give up?  Anyone know
>how to secure the rights of some long-dead poet, say Else Von Freytag

The idiocy that made Faber (I think it was Faber) demand a ridiculous
some of money for the work of David Jones effectively kept his work out
of Poems for the Millenium. It seems to me that there are dozens of
poets who have been similarly badly served, not by copyright, but
rather by copyright holders who had some particular agenda of their own
they wanted to see made manifest. Think of Kerouac, say.
 
Charles Bernstein has, in an exemplary fashion, discussed the royalty
system at Sun&Moon and its impact economically (a given book will earn
the author in the high three figures). Others, like Roof, use the 10%
of copies methodology--which has always seemed to me perfectly good and
maybe even preferable to a royalty payment.
 
So, royalties will not make you rich unless you are Allen Ginsberg (who
has certainly made over $1 million on that alone) or Robert Bly. But
the real money in poetry is almost always indirect -- honoraria for
readings, grants, teaching jobs for which you could not otherwise have
competed, the sale of archives, etc. I've done well enough to have
_averaged_ over $3,000 a year in poetry income over 30+ years. Yet in
1995, my total royalty income was $6.47 (thank you American Poetry
Archives). Like a few other poets (Michael Palmer and Kathleen Fraser
come to mind), I've actually bought a house with "poetry money." But I
certainly wouldn't try to live on it.
 
So I find my interests on both sides of this discussion. As a writer, I
have an interest in getting paid for my work. As a writer, I have an
interest in my work being disseminated as broadly as possible. By any
means necessary, as the Black Panthers would have put it.
 
During my years at Socialist Review, I got to watch a lot of requests
from professors for permission to reprint various works in photocopied
course packs. It seems to be pretty much a routine practice in certain
fields, like sociology, poli sci or history. Yet as the holder of my
own copyright on every one of my books, I'm very rarely asked this same
question for poetry. Personally, I don't believe that people only use
entire books of mine when they want to teach my work in a class.
 
What I do think is that lit courses (and, more exactly, the people who
teach them) tend to have an idea about is an appropriate level of
spending to require of a student that is much lower than would apply in
a course in, say, economics. Partly it's because as students we all got
used to the idea that books of literature are inexpensive mass market
or trade paperbacks, rather than expensive textbooks. On a per-class
basis, a degree in English tends to be pretty inexpensive from the
perspective of texts. In many other fields the average would be on the
high side of $50. And for a graduate course, considerably higher.
 
I think the solution to this is balance. As a writer, as a publisher,
as a teacher, to seek a fair balance between getting the work out and
paying for the right to copy a text. As Jones and Kerouac have taught
us (the hard way), writers should be explicit in their instructions to
literary executors that they want the work to be available, and to
strive to see that that happens. Teachers ought to feel free to use
course packs -- there are lots of good reasons to do so -- but they
ought to clear permission in advance and to pay a nominal per copy fee
to do so. That's never too much to ask.

Thanks, Ron, for a clear and intelligent comment on the
copyright/permission/royalty issue. I'd also say that for some (one here)
who have benefited from poetry money via archive sales, such money mostly
goes into publishing more poetry, therefore, in the economy of such
activities, rather tends to dwindle away. Of course it's somewhat easier to
buy a house in places I've lived (southern Arizona, Minneapolis) than in
Berkeley.
 
But when you say that Allen Ginsberg is one who's earned more than $1
million in royalties, I think that $1 million over Allen's 40 years comes
out to $25,000/year -- not bad at all in the late 1950's, but not so great
in the 1990's. I know, it hasn't been that much every year with consistency,
but just wanted to say that however it's come, I hope Ginsberg's earned a
lot more than $1 million. And I hope you earn more than $6.47 in 1996.

sorry..... but... Farrar Straus (unbelievably!) is coming out with the
new Loy Selected (produced by the executor) and the Loy bio by Carolyn
Burke this June.  Has that been said here?  Advance orders will help a
situation which to put it politely has Mr. Jonathan Galassi sweating in

Baroness Elsa's autobiography-- the one which opens with her trying to
strangle her father-- NEEDS to be made available in the states.
There's a Canadian edition floating around, I think the editor was
Spettigue or something like that, but I don't know the copyright status.
Has anyone here tried to pitch a reprint?  I mean, some one should go for it;
publishers seem kind of receptive to the female modern thing at this
moment, and there's a lot of cultural work to be done.  Regardless of the
executors. (someone should propose an MLA panel on the legal and economic
constructions of literary reputation)(and then only really angry
academics will show and no one will speak candidly)

Well, it's true that the *students* often don't think they should be
paying much for texts in a lit class... but I just did half my book
orders and it's almost impossible NOT to ask them to spend $50, if you
assign say ten whole books and want responsible editions for students to
read (&not wear).  Cheap editions tend to be unselfconscious about their
contents.  Plus the IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST (from signet) rubs off on
any reader tired enough to fall asleep on it.
 
The Sun&Moon reprint of TENDER BUTTONS, on the other hand, is 100&
sleepsafe and really useful for its preservation of the typographical
design of the original.  (Thanks!)
 
Reprinting is a form of translation and I still haven't gotten used to the
Penguin Ted Berrigan.... what would be the copyright status on
DiPrima's REVOLUTIONARY LETTERS, first edition of which is dedicated to
Bob Dylan, and says "this is a free book... power to the people's mimeo
machine"? Did city lights then buy or acquire the rights? And will no one
reprint it with the original cover design??

Questions for Mark or other interested parties:
 
If M poets are not "the main next generation inheritors of language
writing," then who is?  And if the language poets have not produced much
poetic writing of value, who has (aside from Taggart, Waldrop and Duncan)?
And can we really describe poets like Lyn Hejinian as "completely
non-transcendental"?  Who are we including under the rubric of "language"
poetry anyway?  Where do poets like Leslie Scalapino, Kathleen Fraser,
and John Yau fit in?  How about Michael Palmer?  Is he an L-poet or a
proto-M poet?

Marisa, you managed to get TEN WHOLE books for $50 for yr students?  You do
mean real books, right?  Not pamplets from the tobacco industry or
instructions for the 1040?  I just had to spend $60 for five books, plus
$25 or so for a sizable compilation of essays for one class.  The five were
thin paperback novels, all less than 150 pages, relatively good quality for
small(ish) press stuff.  But the least expensive was still seven bucks.
The last time i saw a price on _Zen & the Art..._, it was $9.95 for a
paperback on cheap paper, which i left on the bus one day.  I managed to
find a copy in a used book store for $3.  It turns out that it was printed
two months after i was born, with an original cover price of $2.25!!

this seems to assume a linear progression, like a torch being passed
frm olympian to olympian?   which i think is not very accurate, useful,
nor desirable way to view th recent history ov poetic practice...

Subject:      Charles Alexander, John Milton, & 24 Hours of Democracy
 
Following my post earlier concerning the 24 Hours of Democracy project
Charles Alexander suggested I look up a work by John Milton concerning
censorship of the press.  While I was not able to find the exact text he
referred to I did remember the 'AREOPAGITICA' and pulled out my copy.
After rereading it I searched the net, found it through a university, and
webbified the whole thing.  On Thursday it will be posted to the project
 
You can now find it at http://www.chronotope.com/24/milton.html
(a brownie to anyone who can tell me what chronotope means and where it
comes from)
 
Charles has begun work on a short introductory preface to Milton's work
putting it in the context of this whole CDA situation.  I want to thank him
publicly for his generosity and interest.
 
I would like to stress once again that anyone on this list who can
contribute would be most welcome to participate.  I can host anyone's essay
who does not have a permanent location where they can post it.
 
I would especially like to invite the propriator's of the various small
presses on this list to contribute as this CDA has the potential to dampen
or extinguish any hopes of moving texts through this medium.  Unless of
course they fit the definition of 'clean' as hoisted upon us by the
Congress.  I know that this medium is a good place where small presses can
compete equally with the big houses and I hope that members of this list
see this as an opportunity to be heard in a forum where they are usually
not present.
 
I also would like to extend an invitation to any small presses out there
looking for a web space in which to present their books:  I offered Douglas
Messerli space on the very day he opened Sun & Moon on the web and will
extend the same offer to anyone else who is interested.  Douglas called my
offer generous and kind and I think you'll also find it so if you are
interested.  (Sorry Douglas, I have been way to busy to return to your site
- I am trying to wire an elementary school in my neighborhood for NetDay96
and I have been working 12 hour days for over a week now on this 24 Hours
project - I'll be back though.)  If anyone is interested in either of these
offers please contact me at filkins@chronotope.com for additional
information.
 
Thanks for your time.

Subject:      Venice: Poetry and Performance Art Workshop
 
I wrote a note a few weeks ago regarding an international  poetry and
performance art workshop/institute sponsored by Zenobio Institute of Venice,
Italy and Segue Foundation in New York.  The following announcement offers
more particulars.  Those of you who have indicated your interest in the event
by responding by e-mail (Ericalin @ aol.com) will be getting apps by snail.
 For those reading about this for the first time please drop me a line.
 
SITE SPECIFIC
May 4 1996 through June 1, 1996
 
Literature and Performance Art In a Waterbound City
at Zenobio Institute -- Laboratory for the New Urban Landscape  in Venice,
Italy
 
Site Specific:  "meditations and investigations between artist and physical
space"
 
Site Specific is a month-long workshop in literature and theater using the
environs of Venice, Italy as the basis for literary investigation and
artistic production.  The goal of the workshop is to stretch the boundaries
of the written and spoken text by incorporating the "sites/cites/sights" of
the city's many architectural settings as dynamic elements in literary and
performance art.
 
Workshop participants will become intimate with a Venice seen through the
lens of architecture, urban history, philsophy and aesthetics.  Exploration
of the city's poetic possibilities will go beyond its monumentality to an
investigation of its symbolic, morphological amd utopian gestures with the
assistance of an international faculty and Venetian based critics and
writers.
 
Faculty includes:  Fiona Templeton, artist in residence;  Charles Bernstein,
Lee Ann Brown, Erica Hunt, Julie Patton, Tom Raworth, Schuldt and Lucio
Pozzi.
 
Site Specific will take place as part of the 1996 Zenobio Institute Spring
program, based in the baroque palace of Ca' Zenobio.  Located in a quiet
sestriere of  Venice, the palace and its gardens are a registered national
monument. The complex includes studio space and grand public rooms that can
accommodate lectures, seminars and exhibitions.  Zenobio Institute is an
interdisciplinary center for inquiry, dialog and experiment into urban
contexts.
 
The cost of the four week workshop is $2,300, includes tuition for workshops,
the performance art intensive (with Templeton) and supervision of independent
projects.  The fee also covers residential acocommodations in two and three
bedroom apartment (two persons to a room) containing kitchens, baths and
living rooms.  Single rooms can be arranged for an extra charge.  Please
indicate your preference with your application.
The fees do not cover air travel, meals or field trips.
 
Advanced students and practitioners are invited to apply by e-mail or letter
or fax to the address appearing below.  Please include a sample of your work,
no longer than 20 pages, or in the case of video, 30 minutes long.
 Submissions should be accompanied by a stamped, self-addressed return
envelope.
 
Applications will be processed as we receive them. The earlier you send your
application the sooner we can reserve a space for you in the workshop.
 Applications should be accompanied by a deposit of $100 payable to the Segue
Foundation/Zenobio, refundable only if the entire program is cancelled.
 
The final deadline for full payment is March 30, 1996.
 
Please direct applications to
Erica Hunt/Julie Patton
c/o Segue Foundation
303 East 8th Street
New York, N.Y.  10009
212/674-0199
FAX 212/353-2089
e-mail:  ericalin @ aol.com
 
NB:  This is a fledgling enterprise, which once launched will create some
precedent for  entropic entrepreneurism abroad...ahem... I mean future
writing institutes at Zenobio, a kind of think tank for urban centered art.
 Though this particular workshop is an experiment in a time of grant famine,
 we'll try to make subsidies/scholarships available as soon as we have a
sense of the enrollment.

much apparent mystification from some profs and many copy shops about
this course packet stuff -- while the "fair use" doctrine remains a legal
quagmire, it has always been clear previously that hte production of
anthologies for course use without permission to reprint insides was
illegal -- on the other hand, fair use permitted all along that if I saw,
say, one of Ron's poems in the morning news that perfectly made a point I
wanted to discuss in class that day I was free, once only, to copy such
for class use -- grey area was always just how much of a poem can I copy
for repeated use before permission is required --
 
 as someone who once actually received a check for $7.00 as a result of
an honest prof at USC using my stuff in a reader, I can attest to the
fact that such arrangements can, as my boy said, be very easily done --
and there's plenty of room in the law for that spontaneous bop
educational prosody use in class --
 
meanwhile, I have promised myself to order at least one small press title
for each class I teach, no matter how much grief I get about it from the
university book store

  Dear Christopher Beach---
    interesting points about where these lines blur and/or mesh, or simply
    cease to exist....
    When you ask about poets like Heijinian and the accuracy of calling
    them "non-transcendental", I am reminded of the way Jerome McGann
    tries to dance the question--referring to Heijinian and other L poets
    (even perhaps Kathy Acker!) as examples of what he calls
    "a nonmystical and nonromantic theory of poetry-as-inspiration."
    in BLACK RIDERS. I wonder what the writers in question would say about
    that......chris s.

Yes, Ron, it was Faber who reputedly asked for a ludicrous sum to reproduce
David Jones' work in Poems for the Millennium, and thereby effectively kept him
out of the anthology. It didn't surprise me to hear that, as Faber is notorious
for its greed in such matters. It's one thing to demand that poets be fairly
recompensed for their work, but this has to be a balanced against other factors:
being included in an anthology enhances a poet's reputation, leads readers to
seek out the original books, etc.
 
I have known poets themselves cut off their noses to spite their faces. When the
late Eric Mottram and I were involved in editing The New British Poetry a few
years ago, one (living) poet who shall be nameless demanded a sum far in excess
of what was on offer from Paladin/HarperCollins, and refused to allow his work
to appear unless we conceded. There was no way we could squeeze any extra money
out of the publisher, so he had to be dropped. At the eleventh hour he relented
and asked to be included anyway, but by that time we had replaced him.
 
Publishing anthologies is an incredibly expensive business, as I now know to my
cost. The 30 contributors to Out of Everywhere will hardly be able to do the
week's shopping on what they got from us (Reality Street Editions), and the
amount of space allocated to each is less than I would wish, yet the book's
production has broken the bank for us. Hopefully, sales income should now start
materialising, but of course it will all be ploughed back into producing new
books. As for the poets themselves, I hope the selection will serve as a shop
window for their own books -- this is not the least function of anthologies.

Thanks to one and all for the recent comments on book orders for
classes.  Special thanks to Joe Amato, whose descriptions of using
the internet and e-sites for his class have re-directed my thinking
about a contemporary (post-1945...) American poetry course I'll be
teaching in the fall.  Last time I taught the course, we used two
"opposed" anthologies--Poulin and Messerli.  Very little overlap.
(Cf. "teach the conflicts...")  And we used several individual books
(yes, including small press work).  The students (graduate students,
some in an MFA program, some in MA/PhD programs) had to
construct their own anthology as a final project--also, address issues
such as for whom the anthology was being constructed, its imagined
uses, costs of publishing the anthology,  etc.  This next go around, I'm
leaning toward using nothing but individual books of poetry with a
heavy emphasis on small presses.  Joe's remarks show me how exciting
an electronic component can and will be.  For example, students here
tend to be utterly unaware of electronic magazines, including the
work of Jake Berry (who is nearby).  The Electronic Poetry Center
will be a crucial browsing site for the class.  Thanks again to Joe
and others for you unwitting assistance.

Here two items from Pen's IPEX news letter, of interest to this list:
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN: PROTESTS MARK SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF FATWA AGAINST RUSHDIE
 
PEN American Center marked the seventh anniversary of the issuing
of a fatwa, or death edict, against "Satanic Verses" author
Salman Rushdie "and all those (including U.S. citizens)
associated with the publication of his book, `The Satanic
Verses'" by sending a letter to United States President Bill
Clinton. The 14 February letter asked Clinton to renew efforts to
bring pressure to bear on Iran to retract this threat, and read
in part, "As you know, the EU [European Union] Troika has been
working on the issue through a Critical Dialogue with Iran.
However, this initiative has yet to yield concrete results.
Despite some conciliatory words from lower-ranking Iranian
officials last year, the Iranian government has persisted in its
refusal to gainsay the fatwa. When asked to provide a written
undertaking to refrain from all acts of international terrorism,
it demurred. Indeed, Javad Kajouyen Fini, the new Iranian Charge
d'Affaires to Norway (a country where Rushdie's publisher
narrowly avoided a 1993 assassination attempt) has recently
stated that the fatwa remains in effect."
 
"While we deeply appreciate your past support for Mr. Rushdie,"
the letter continues, "we now ask that fresh mechanisms for
exerting influence over Iran on this issue be explored. We note
that Iran is in a period of political transition, with both
parliamentary and presidential elections due to take place this
year. Opportunities for reiterating the U.S. position on this
issue will no doubt present themselves and we trust the U.S. will
use every occasion, whether in private or in public, to endeavour
to persuade Iran that it must publicly renounce its policy of
pursuing its ends through threats and terrorist actions before it
can be seen as a responsible member of the community of nations."
 
According to ARTICLE 19 (A19), the Iranian government, in issuing
the fatwa, "sought to suppress a book and to silence its author.
These intentions have been thwarted by the collective efforts of
many thousands of individuals and organizations which include
writers, booksellers, the International Rushdie Defence Committee
and its network of national committees, and not least by the
author himself. `The Satanic Verses' has not been suppressed and,
as the publication of a new novel clearly demonstrates, the
author has not been silenced." "This is not a story of fear and
failure", claims Salman Rushdie, "but of successful resistance."
 
NORTH AMERICA
 
UNITED STATES: HRW JOINS LAWSUIT AFTER TELCOM BILL SIGNED
 
Shortly after President Clinton signed into law a new
telecommunications bill on 8 February, the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU), acting on behalf of 20 individuals and
organizations, including Human Rights Watch (HRW), filed papers
in federal District Court in Philadelphia. On 9 February, HRW
released a statement explaining that they joined the lawsuit
because they have "opposed this legislation since its inception
-- not only as a violation of the First Amendment, which is
asserted in our lawsuit, but as a violation of international
legal safeguards, such as the guarantee in the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of the right "to seek,
receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless
of frontiers ... through any media."
 
The statement adds that "(HRW) joined this litigation not only
because we oppose the Communications Decency Act in principle,
but because, like the other plaintiffs, we are concerned that it
could have a direct and damaging impact on our work to expose the
most serious violations of human rights, such as sexual abuse and
sexual torture." Adding that, "If, each time we publish our
reports or refer students to them, we must now assess the
potential risk of criminal prosecution, the only people who will
benefit are those who commit the terrible human rights abuses we
expose. The people who will suffer are the victims of human
rights abuse, who rely on our capacity to mobilize public outrage
for their prevention and remedy."
 
An affidavit filed in support of ACLU by Dinah PoKempner, Acting
General Counsel for HRW, says in part: "I am concerned that the
words `patently offensive' or `indecent' as used in the statute
lack a definite scope and are inherently subjective. I believe
that graphic descriptions of sexual and violent abuse in HRW
reports, as well as explicit online discussions of sex and
violence among investigators, office staff, volunteers, and
witnesses through e-mail or on listservs or newsgroups may be
considered `patently offensive' or `indecent'. Were HRW to
eliminate such references in our on-line communications, it would
severely compromise our ability to expose human rights abuses
around the world. If our staff and volunteers had to self-censor
their on-line communications, I am concerned that the
reliability, quality, and impact of discussions, reports, and
eyewitness accounts would be greatly reduced."
 
The ACLU suit argues that provisions of the Communications
Decency Act of the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996 are
unconstitutional because they will criminalize expression that is
protected by the First Amendment. "Nothing less than the future
of free expression is at stake here," said Ira Glasser, ACLU
Executive Director. "By passing this legislation, Congress has
misunderstood a promising new medium and has, once again, turned
its back on the First Amendment."

Dear Christopher Beach:
 
        Thanks for your useful comments--my first response would be that
the notion that there must be one "main inheritor" group of a poetic
tradition or set of practices simply won't really hold water--the
influence of language writing, say, has permeated a number of contexts in
a number of ways. I think the Apex of the M magazine has perhaps revealed
the most directly Oedipal relation to language writing--personally they
know each other well, the Apex poets are younger, and I think they've
tried too hard to "reject the parents" in a way that doesn't really
work--a return to the notion of poetry as unproblematically
(although complexly) accessing the
"spiritual" doesn't really wash for me. (Apex's position is more complex
than this, but they've written their own manifestos and I dont need to
rewrite them). I respect Apex for putting their finger on a key problem,
and being brave enough to speak up, but I think their answers miss the boat.
 
I, personally, don't share their argument that language writing has been
of theoretical significance but has not produced any poetry of value. I
think such a position is rather painfully mistaken, and has been one of
the reasons that they've received as much flak as they have. But assuming
that language poetry has had not only a significant influence, but a
hugely overwhelming one for poets of my own context (a context I'll leave
loosely defined, because it is), the question becomes how to respond to
that influence without taking any of the two more typical 20th century
paths--i.e., complete acceptance or complete rejection. One answer for me
has been to extend some of the theoretical implications of language
writing into poetic arenas where it had not been extended before--I'm
interested in rewritings of lyric poetry, say, or various postlanguage
New York School conjunctions. And there are a huge variety of others
being worked out by other people like Juliana Spahr, Steve Evans, Charles
Borkhuis and many many more. Response for my own project has
been complex--one language writer who I greatly respect has called this
project "conservative," but when I ask him who constitutes
"non-conservative," it turns out to be only those poets whose writing he
believes looks most like his own, i.e. the only non-conservative writers
are language writers and those who he believes imitate them, narrowly
defined. Some writers of my own generation
think I cow-tow too much to language writing--that is, that I don't
reject them enough. Such responses are not really a problem for me--for
me, they simply show how complex (and emotional) the issue of influence is,
although I have to admit that sometimes I wish that a lot of people
didn't feel so defensive about being influenced, or for that matter about
being an influence.
 
        As to who's a language writer or not, that argument seems a
little done-to-death to me at this point--clearly there's no
cut-and-dried litmus test, but various degrees of interaction. I've not
yet thought of Lyn Heijinian as transcendental (make a case, I'll listen)
but I certainly know that Lew Daly, for instance, has made a case for Susan
Howe as such. I don't think he's right about that, really, although
there is more evidence of it in her work than is sometimes recognized.

The term was coined by M. M. Bakhtin, also spelt Baxtin, to refer to the
way matters of time and space interrelate in novelistic representations--
their "intrinsic connectedness."  The concept functions to produce
"formally constitutive categor[ies] of literature," meaning that he uses
it to generate categories of novels in a manner that points up formal
structures but doesn't get too airily abstract or ahistorical about it.
It can be a way, for example, of summing up and explaining formal
differences between _Joseph Andrews_, a "road novel," and _The Castle of
Otranto_, etc.
 
See Bakhtin's _The Dialogic Imagination_, U Texas P 1981.

On the place & influence of language poetry there's an interesting if maybe
tangential essay by Mikhail Epstein in "Third Wave", the anthology of
contemporary russian poetry (I think edited in part by Lyn Hejinian?).
Epstein compares what he sees as 3 main trends in late 20th cent
russian poetry with three streams from the early part of the century
- Futurism, Symbolism & Acmeism & finds some parallels.  & there do seem
to be some similarities between the "word as such" in Russian futurism
(esp. Khlebnikov) & language poetry.  Also, he gets into this issue
of the "transcendental" since one contemporary Russian strain seems
to emphasize a kind of multilayered, symbolist & in some cases
"spiritual" perception.  He locates a middle stream, between
the two others [i.e. a kind of dada satirical futurism on the one hand
and a transcendentalism on the other] - which he relates to Acmeism -
which foregrounds the rhetorical/logical choices of the poet.  [I've
probably muddled this some - don't have the book in front of me.]

PREMONITIONS: The Kaya Anthology of New Asian North American Poetry
 
edited by Walter K. Lew
 
 
The most comprehensive anthology of Asian North American poetry to date,
Premonitions gathers work ranging from cyberpunk meditations and Buddhist
odes to L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E-influenced and neo-Orientalist writingQand
juxtaposes them in ways that both echo and subvert categories of theme,
poetics, and identity. Video and multimedia texts, pidgin poetry, queer
writing, and Canadian open-field compositions further broaden the scope
of this ground-breaking collection. The 73 contributors include veteran
authors like Jessica Hagedorn, Lawson Fusao Inada, Trinh T. Minh-ha, Fred
Wah, Kimiko Hahn, Arthur Sze, and John Yau, as well as such "premonitory"
new poets as R. Zamora Linmark, Barry Masuda, Evelyn Lau, Amitava Kumar,
and an emerging generation of Vietnamese and Korean American poets. Also
featured are previously unpublished poems by the late Frances Chung, Roy
Kiyooka, and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha.
 
SOME PRAISE FOR PREMONITIONS:
"An exquisite artifact of activist experimentalism, theoretically smart
and so beautiful it hurts, Premonitions promises to be a landmark in
American letters for many years to come."
--Maria Damon, University of Minnesota
 
"When you turn this smokin' tome aloose, you may not be able to get the
poetic license plate number, but you will definitely know it was felony
hit-and-run."
--Wanda Coleman, Author of Hand Dance
 
"An impressive collection distinguished by its variety and sweep. By turns
entertaining, exciting, troubling, it is always provocative. A  major
contribution."
--David Palumbo-liu, Stanford University
 
"Up to recently, Asian American literary anthologies have served to canonize
authors, works, tastes, and ideas. Premonitions is different. From
conception to layout, it explodes impulses to map centers and margins of
Asian American poetry. Premonitions gives us a brilliant variety of
poetry and poets who together show, we are all this and more."
--Stephen Sumida, University of Michigan, Author of And the View from the
Shore: Literary Traditions of Hawaii
 
"Demonstrating the infinite range of possibilities overlooked by the too
easily applied label of 'multicultural'...this collection steeps the
reader in alternative histories and approaches to language and tells
stories seldom--if ever--heard. Recommended for most poetry collections."
--Library Journal

Chris S.--I like McGann's formulation, as a starting point anyway.  I'd
be interested in knowing what Hejinian and other "Language-oriented" poets
think about the role of "inspiration" in their work (this might be a way
of finding common ground between practices of L-poets and M-poets).  I
think there are still ways of thinking about inspiration in various ways
that are non-romantic (at least in the strictest sense), ie. Spicer's
lowghost or Antin's improvisational "talks."  I think Olson and Duncan
are of great importance to L-poetry, and both are very much poets of
"inspiration" (and, certainly in Duncan's case, mystical).  I find that
strain in the interstices of a lot of Language writing as well.

Dear Mark:
 
Thanks for the very interesting reply to my query.  As one who has
thought quite long and hard about questions of poetic influence (altho
not a poet myself), I appreciate your own thinking about these issues.
As to the question of defining who's a language poet and who's not, I ask
it only in the context of getting straight the M-poets' (to me) overly
systematic rejection of Language, without a clear definition of exactly what that
means.  (Or, even more vaguely, the rejection of the "contemporary
avant-garde," a term that covers a lot of ground).
 
I'm not sure if I can mount a good defense of Hejinian as a
"transcendental" poet, but I am about to teach her in my seminar,
so I should have a better idea after that.  I think Daly is right about
Howe as well.  "Transcendental" does not have to mean unrigorous or
ideologically naive.  I mean transcendental in the sense of making space
for the irrational, for the "poetic," whatever that is.  I'm not sure if
it is exactly "religious," but "meditational," perhaps?

   Dear Chris Beach--
        So I'm looking around at language--I mean the "social landscape"
        of language. It's kinda soggy today (late feb. "thaw"). But there's
        all this detritus jutting its head out from melting piles of snow.
        There's the word "inspiration" and there's the word "romantic."
        Funny how people who like the word "ideology" are willing to at
        least be seen hanging around the word "inspiration" why the word
        "romantic" sits there as if it is "Hitler" or "A" or "The" back in
        the days before zukofsky and stein....
        Actually, I won't say "Hitler".
        I could say "Buchanan"---
        Another thing is---why is the word transcendence and romantic worse
        than the word OEDIPAL? Talk about mystification. Two Apex editors
        are women. Oedipal women. Freud as allegedly "secular scientist."
        Yeah, right. Romantic bias all along, underneath "it all" but
        embarrassed by it.
        It isn't that ROMANTIC is "better", but it is interesting to see
        what words we scapegoat. pomophobically yours, chris s

Also for friends & neighbors in San Diego, Pierre reads this afternoon at
CRCA (Matthews 408) @ UCSD, 4:30 P.m. to be followed by a party at JR's
place.  And on Sunday 3:00 p.m. at the Dr. Seuss Room (named for the favorite
San Diego poet) of the Giesel Library (named for the same favorite poet),
there will be a celebration & performance for MILLENNIUM, with the editors
and Rae Armantrout, Michael Davidson, George Lewis (on trombone), Tom
Raworth, and Quincy Troupe.  (Refreshments follow.)
 
Anyway ...

Chris:
The Bloomian pall hangs heavily on us all.  It's difficult to
separate claims of influence motivated by historical/political
context from formal influences supported or betrayed in the work.
 
>"Transcendental" does not have to mean unrigorous or ideologically

While its easy enough to see M-transcendence or Emersonian transcendence
as ideologies in themselves, both seem to want to claim some kind of
escape from the ideological condition of writing.
 
So "M" manifests "One of our primary concerns is to find a way in which
langauge must ultimately yield tothe dangerous life-force in memory
and hope", posing a space for the irrational/ecstatic that is "beyond."
 
Does the work of Howe, to get particular, orient itself towards this
"beyond" or does it aim to make a space within itself for the
irrational/ecstatic voice?
 
And if we take LANG Po as any sort of historical moment--1970s
experimental american--then it makes little sense to exclude poets
like Howe or Hejinian (or as earlier Bernadette Mayer).   I think
it's only when one's using L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E as a bumper to push
off/away from that the narrow caricature becomes useful.

As Mr Stroffolino has used the term "pompophobically" I'd like to assert that

Also, Christopher Beach wrote re Lyn H.: "I mean transcendental in the sense
of making space for the irrational, for the "poetic," whatever that is.  I'm
not sure ifit is exactly "religious," but "meditational," perhaps?"
Can certainly see the meditational in Lyn, & lines of hers like "This
irritation changes life into a sequence of time lapses" or "Solicitude had
for several days now developed a theory, a / polemic / I have not isolated
the active element of my medium -- my / medium is mediation / Aesthetic
impression swimming clockwise / the eyes and cheeks of hate / An angel's
violent ways"
(from _Oxata pg 51) -- Now, there's an angel in there, but it's violent in a
situation where "mediation" is the "medium" -- I would say, off-the-cuffily
(beat that one c.s.) -- that there seems to be an interest, at times, in a
_language of transcendence_ in Lyn's work but no real belief (or at least a
very strong distrust) in it as an experience outside of language. Kind of
like
Heidegger's "throwness" but the language-ball getting caught by Wittgenstein.
Hank, is L.H. still down there, maybe she'd like to chime in on this. . .

Subject:      re : beyond L or M
 
On ideology & "the beyond" in writing, shucks, can I recommend another
book, gang?  Don't shoot me.  It's "Dividing Muse", by Sanford Budick.
It's about Milton.  Milt, remember, was attacked by Eliot & others before
him in a characterization that made him sound almost like a Language
poet:  his imagery was nonvisual, self-negating, returning into itself
in pure rhetorical verbiage.
    Budick describes a theological tradition dating back to Philo,
carried on through Bonaventure in the Middle Ages, and brought to the
fore during 1600s Puritanism & Ramistic logic, a tradition he finds
in Milton.  Philo opposed Heraclitus' pure binary cosmos - yin/yang
in constant opposition, with a Biblical cosmology.  Philo is so close
to Heraclitus because he also characterizes the created world as
consisting of defined binary opposites; but the universal opposites
are both created and RECONCILED by a third element - the dividing
Logos, the sharp sword which maintains all things in opposition
and unites them.  ("Divide" can mean both split & share).
    The logos, of course proceeds from the transcendent ground
which precedes the created cosmos.  What Philo objected to in
Heraclitus was not simply the unending violence of his cosmos
but its totalizing power (there is no "beyond" the lock of
nature).  In Philo, to repeat, language descends from a "divine"
Word which maintains the binary opposites in their integrity
while holding them together - a different architectonics.
 
     What does this have to do with what we're discussing?
Ideology might be characterized as the conscious historical
expression of dialectical opposites.  Budick suggests a Milton
& a literary tradition which does not deny dialectics yet
maintains a transcendent ground for a poetic "word".  The
influence of Heraclitus seems pretty visible in modern &
postmodern philosophy.  But if deconstruction, for example,
posits an unbridgeable gap between sign and referent,
Philo counters with a cosmology acknowledging the same
binary divide.  Ergo, writing DOES reflect reality, i.e.
deconstruction contradicts itself. IF the philosophical
ground of language poetry rests in the acceptance of the
deconstructive "gap" (and I'm not saying it does - I don't
know!) - then Budick has sketched out a tradition of poetics
which might relate to M & beyond.  - Henry Gould

Jackson Mac Low (hello Jackson) once told me that it was
really stretching things to call him a Language Poet
since his publishing and performing activities preceded
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E magazine by a few decades. I think
what Messrs Wallace Stroffolino and Beach are talking
about--torch-passing--has more to do with that great
subject of literature, hubris, than with how writing
has changed in the last five years. And Mark, I know
you know I was kidding. The subject of the study of
the recent present should not be the mediation
of power from one group to another but how to remain
alert, how to recognize what's going on in time.

"Diaries Used to Predict Disease...
 
In a study based on the diaries of young women about to join an
order of nuns, researchers reported that the women's writing
styles when they were in their twenties predicted with uncanny
accuracy which of them would be severely demented with
Alzheimer's disease six decades later.
 
The nuns whose sentences were gramatically complex and packed
with ideas when they were in their twenties remained sharp of
mind when they were in their eighties.  In contrast, almost
all those whose sentences were simple and comparatively devoid
of complex grammatical constructions were demented six decades
later."

Dear Henry,
          When I read Joe's post--which I've since deleted apparently--I
thought he was asking a somewhat different question. Or, rather,
assuming that Blasing's position/critical practice implied a poetics.
Doesn't it?
          Like the rest I ain't read the book either, so your quotation
opened a small window. I have to say it looks a pretty ugly  out there.
Writers like that neither know what they are saying nor care much. They
write as if poets were stupid--certainly not as bright as they are. They
are so sure of the  intelligence they imagine belongs to the
institutional  discourse they use, of that is its 'naturalness', that
they are perhaps unlikely to write otherwise.
          'The prevailing DOGMA that the specialness of poetic language
lies in the inseparability of its form and content then appears to be an
historically specific IDEOLOGY, a particular CONVENTION of getting from
the CONVENTIONALITY of the signifier to intentional meanings.' Wha..?
DOGMA=IDEOLOGY=CONVENTION????? I should read this book?

In-Reply-To:  <v02130503ad505b6a6774@[128.97.154.217]>
 
Yes, *Areopagitica* is a good place to begin reading Milton for his views
on censorship; but--perhaps you're already aware of this--DON'T FORGET to
read his later prose tracts as well: (see especially *Eikonoklastes* and
*The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates*).  During the Commonwealth's brief
moment in British history, Milton held the official position of
Secretary of Foreign Tongues (i.e. the State Censor) and also defended
Charles's execution.
 
So, what's the moral of (t)his story?
 
A: Freedom (of expression) within limits?
B: Conditions of the publishable and of the sayable?
C: The return of the repressed?
 
As Susan Howe suggests in her marvelous book, *a bibliography of the king's
book; or, eikon basilike*, (and as I will here assert), a consideration of
such an ethical question might first begin with the given-ness of the
texts themselves:
 
"to the reader           the work"
 
In other words, one ought to begin by looking at the sheer differences, the
discontinuities between texts, and, in turn, at the specific social and
personal predicaments which such differences bespeak.
 
On Bakhtin's "chronotope", see also *The Culture of Literacy* by Wlad
Godzich.  Godzich has some very useful and provocative thoughts (in the
last two chapters) about reading Bakhtin's formulation of the
"chronotope" in relation to his own notion of "discursive creativity."

Jordan,
      I'm working on poetry and wall climbing in New Zealand. This is
not a thing you have in the us of A, i beleive, but in this sports mad
country of mine wall climbing has developed a considerable following.
Since it began to be televised there's been talk of professionalising it
like rigby and league.  Poet wall climbers (and their'drivers'--they're
the people who assist the climbers in their endeavours) are a standard
feature of readings in Auckland now. Maybe there's a place for them on
the bill of some of your 'slams' that I hear about. Incidentally, do
your slams include bungy jumpers?

impressed with his taste in poetry though he makes quite a play with it
in an art world which usually doesn't know the difference. Am I being

Just finished an excellent and energizing book of poetry, Species of
Abandoned Light, by Jake Berry (Pantagraph Press). Berry combines several
streams of language/consciousness, to tap into the archetypal time-flow of
language-energy.
 
I think perhaps Berry and some other poets like Ivan Arguelles and Sheila
Murphy are an interweaving of LANGUAGE and Black Mountain poetry
(particularly that of Duncan). Don't know if there's a term for what these
folks et al are doing.
 
Appreciate any reactions, suggestions of other related writers. Some of the
people involved with Cyanosis (a magazine that's only had two issues a
couple years apart, but is quite powerful in various ways.), for example, or
with Talisman magazine.

"Alzheimer's is a thinking disease," said David Snowden, associate
professor of preventative medicine at the University of Kentucky.  "It
seems plausible that if you can develop your thinking ability, you might
be protected against the thinking diseases later on."
 
"The way you use words reflects a fundamental way you do your thinking,"
he said.  "Language may be a marker of general mental ability."
 
In what is being called "the nun study," 93 nuns now in their 80s had
their current mental abilities judged against a biographical essay they
wrote as initiates (around age 22).  Ninety percent of those now
suffering from Alzheimer's wrote their essays in a comparatively simple
style.  Those whose writing style showed complexity, on the other hand,
tended not to contract the disease.  The New York Times article of
yesterday suggested that the degeneration we call Alzheimer's may begin
early in life; it may also be diagnosed with a writing sample.
 
Complexity of style is therefore a sign of mental health.  By this logic,
language poets are more mentally healthy than some other poets.

No, Wystan -- can't say I'm an Armijani fan. He does seem to be something of
a local hero around here, what with the walker art center in his corner. I
understand they are mounting some kind of major exhibition of his work
(can't show the bridges, but other works & sketches, I suppose, and prints)
in a year or so. And now he's doing a bridge for the Olympics in Atlanta.
 
And for a lot of sculptural book arts works, language is a gesture, or a
rather simple one-line insight, more than a "reading room." On the other
hand, I am still committed to the space of the book, taken conventionally or
experimentally (inventing possible forms for books), as "reading room." But
in the case of the latter kinds of books, the room must be read as much as
the text.

My wife read it aloud over breakfast. Basically, if you're a nun,
there's a predictable correlation between the richness of your
linguistic usage and your ability to stave off Alzheimer's. Richness is
defined as "ideas per sentence," with a bias toward maximum density of
ideas.
 
But as I pointed out to her, this does not explain Oppen in the
slightest.

Just as an aside, the study referenced doesn't ring true intuitively as so
many such studies seem to do. That feeling of "ahh...I suspected as much"
just didn't happen here. Those having Alz. I've known most closely were
gifted with language, demonstrated complexity in their writing (to the best
of what I've known).  Therefore, the study perplexes me.

In some ways, Spicer seems the reluctant inheritor of Keats' "negative
capability" with an attitude. Where the "penetralium of the mystery"
is simply what Robin Blaser, in that beautiful essay on Olson's
violets, calls "the depth of the world". But with Spicer always
grotesquely and painfully funny. God as a big white baseball.

 "This includes a new crop of thinkers, the college
 folks who think of themselves as Theorists. In this
 connection the anonymous pamphlets coming out of
 somewhere (Buffalo?) purporting to be by Edgar
 Poe -- so far I've seen contemporized versions of the
 "Letter to B--" and a review of Lew Daly's _Swal-
 lowing the Scroll_" -- are tremendous good fun, simply
 from the abutting of that lovely snarling prose against
 Our Moderns, as if it really were Poe's brand-new
 fresh response. Even if they weren't well-done it
 would be funny. But they are well done, and as such
 are the liveliest possible reminders of what recent
 US writing lacks, an astringently stylish style.  My
 heart warmed to the two I've seen, I am _refreshed_ by
 them, because only our best writing survives being
 embedded as quotes in a Poe-ish matrix, and from
 the joy at seeing that Poe's approach, his manner of
 proceeding, is utterly modern -- if anything gains
 from being applied to current material. The effect is
 less pastiche than vindication."

Wystan,
You said you looked through the Blasing window briefly & it looked
cold outside.  Well, where I come from when it gets cold we put on our
coats & go ice fishing.  I don't defend Blasing's particular brand of
academic turgidity, but in her case I think there's some substance
to it.  I don't think poets are required to master or even read such
huffaguff; but if they're going to see critical superiority complexes
everywhere & separate poets from critics, they might as well hang
up their skates.  Isn't that something the Langposse has taught us?

UCLA Library does not yet have the Blasing book, nor is it in any store
here -- but I'm gonna get that sucker & read it somehow!!!
 
this makes Blasing's book, at the moment, a transcendent problem for me.
 
curious about the uses of that word "transcendent" here -- it should not
really be synonymous with "poetic" or with "inspiration" -- & I suspect
folk want to make it so out of a generally positive feeling about those
htree words in tandem --
 
or three words, for that matter
 
maybe in the sense that the poetic often exceeds the "usual limits," but
so do most drivers on the freeway, and I don't think that's what's meant
by the usage here of late --
 
what us inspired, poetical materialist types object to is claims to
transcendence from other poets who tell us that they are in contact with
something "beyond material existence or apart from the universe" or
"something beyond the limits of experience and knowledge" -- that is, few
poets on the list mean by "transcendence" the logical sense of  being an
a priori condition;   and I get myself in an uproar when confronted with
claims that the "poetic" or "inspiration" are something unknowable or
apart from experience, especially since this can usually be translated as
"I have access to this inaccessible realm and you don't" --

Alan, good point, chain letters can get users punished, but this wasn't
exactly a chain letter, more of a mass mailing--which i've never known to
get anyone in trouble, as long as they choose a fairly responsible
distribution, and the content was pretty clean.  A distribution like the
one in question is no different than anything else we post to the list.
 
I appreciate people passing this information along.  This is the most,

ultimately it'll be helpful.

Aldon, maybe you can get the Blasing book through interlibrary loan.
The only other thing I can suggest is headin up to City Lights

of action would be well worth the bus fare.
 
Your comments on the symboliste aspirations behind "transcendence"

Ron--I'm not sure exactly what "Calvinistic atheism" would be, but I do
think that Spicer was working both within and against a transcendental
tradition, both back thru poets like Lorca and Rilke, and in dialogue
with Duncan and Blaser.  The meditative in Spicer would have to do with
the poetic process itself, the process of "dictation"--having the
furniture in the room and waiting for the signal from outside (from Mars or
wherever) to come in and write the poem.

Subject:      & Hobbes
 
Ron Silliman asked:
 
"How would you describe a poet like Spicer, who certainly has room for the
irrational, but who comes fairly close to a space I would describe as
Calvinistic athieism. Not exactly transcendental, not exactly meditative."
 
I think the issue in Spicer has two parts, both having to do with the
"afflatus": The first is the relation of the afflator and afflatum to what
was a perceived social miasm. That is, the reduction of social scale to that
of The Place was one reaction to the perception of The King of May as an
aspect of the Big Lie. If the Fix was on, then "running up the back of the
old flash" involved not just the age or physical condition of the old flash
but possibly and more pointedly his relation to the bosses. That is, the
afflatus itself becomes devalued in the comparison.
 
The second is, of course, the SOURCE, hence the stated parallel with the
meditative, in that, the answers (ie, God =) come from all over (a big white
baseball; the ocean does not mean to be listened to; no big lightless
automobile for him--if he is hit, let them show it; sea birds shit on it;
etc.). That is, the devaluation of afflatus leads to a social insecurity of
space propagating itself in an order of vehicular love objects, a
dysfunctionalized intensity organizing context as what NEEDS disjunction in
order to be available, the sometimes bad irregular precipice eros can trace
outside us.
 
What's puzzling to me is that Calvinist remainder, the by-product. If the
investigation of source pushes him to a singleness of purpose if not of
response, it's still curious that, as Blaser said of him, he never could
forgive the occasion of his own birth. So that version of Orpheus as against
the Sophie Tucker version Duncan said he was after. Which is a curious
dualism for such an antidualist to get stuck with. Eventually sending up that
CHEAP SLEEP OVER THERE flare.

Subject:      David Jones & Faber
 
Regarding David Jones, Faber and Faber, Poems for the Millennium
 
There are ways to deal with Faber's permissions demands, but one must be
tenacious.  Back about twenty-five years ago when I edited 23 Modern
British Poets I simply paid what they asked.  This meant that two Faber
poets got about half the permissions budget between them. However, when I
was working on David Jones: Man and Poet and Selected Works of David Jones
(National Poetry Foundation & University of Wales Press) I found that I
could negotiate reductions through people like John Bodley, Rosemary Goad,
and even Mavis Pindard, the permissions manager.  One must keep at it.  In
1992, for example, Bodley wrote that he would "recommend the rights dept to
charge reduced rates, since this is in a good cause." I wonder how hard the
permissions people at California worked on the problem.  David Jones is
such a wonderful poet that it's sad to find him missing from yet another
context--Poems for the Millennium--that would find him new readers and put
his work in the hands of possibly sympathetic readers. His work desperately
needs a nudge at the moment.  He appears in very few anthologies and, when
he does appear, selections are usually inadequate. He is, of course,
difficult to antholigize (but then so are about half of the poets in Poems
for the Millennium).  At any rate, I have found in the past that it is
possible to negotiate with Faber.  It's not pleasant, but it's possible.
It takes a lot of time.  The time is well spent, however, if in the end it
produces the poems.

   Aldon raises a good critique of "transcendental"
   But I'm not so sure that this question of a discourse of the transcendental
   need in every case mean "I have access to this inaccessible realm and you
   don't" in a kind of snooty way. Perhaps it is a much of a "nominalist"
   issue as much as a "realist" one. In the sense that this "you" that
   the "I" of certain poems may claim its "superior" can be read as something
   "inside" that speaker as much as outside. To me, poems that may appeal
   to the "transcendental" are in some ways not so different from a more
   "radical skepticism" and both modes can be aligned in critiquing the
   unreflective language of "nature" as a given.

Comments: To: Capl-L <CAP-L@vm1.spcs.umn.edu>
 
I'll be part of a panel on electronic publishing at the AWP Convention
in Atlanta this April; I'll be doing a presentation on using the internet
to keep books in print, to distribute them despite the economic pressures
that are driving small & university presses out of bookstores, etc.
(Given all the scares about internet as the death of the book, it seems
important to turn attention to the alternate economy the net can sustain.)
I've run across a few instances of small presses and bookstores marketing
their stock on mailing lists and on the web; I'd like to know more and to
make these resources more widely available, and this convention seems
like a good start.  If you know of major distributors on-line--especially
those dealing with small press books--or poetry bookstores, presses, samisdat
networks with websites or email addresses, please send them to me, and I'll
see that they're distributed as widely as I can manage.  I'll get them
out at AWP, and I'll post them on the CAPA site as well.
 
Many thanks,
Wendy

Subject:      PBS, NPR
 
In light of recent attention given to poetry in public media (the Holman
series and LINEbreak come to mind) as well as for obvious other reasons,
the following seems well worth our signatures...
 
 
PBS, NPR (National Public Radio), and the arts are facing major cutbacks
 in funding.  In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce spending
 costs and streamline their services, the government officials believe that
 
 the funding currently going to these programs is too large a portion of
 funding for something which is seen as "unworthwhile".
 
 Currently, taxes from the general public for PBS equal $1.12 per person
 per year, and the National Endowment for the Arts equals $.64 a year in
 total. A January 1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of
 Americans wish to keep funding for PBS, third only to national defense
 and law enforcement as the most valuable programs for federal funding.
 
 Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations committees each have
 13 subcommittees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies.
 Each subcommittee passes its own appropriation bill. The goal each year
 is to have each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year, which is
 October 1.  In the instance of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
the
 bill determines the funding for the next three years. When this issue
 comes up in 1996, the funding will be determined for fiscal years
 1996-1998.
 
 The only way that our representatives can be aware of the base of
 support for PBS and funding for these types of programs is by making
 our voices heard. Please add your name to this list if you believe in what
 
 we stand for, and then forward the list to anyone else you think might
 want to sign it.  This list will be forwarded to the President of the
 United States, the Vice President of the United States, and
 Representative Newt Gingrich, who is the instigator of the action to cut
 funding to these worthwhile programs.
 If you happen to be the 50th, 100th, 150th, etc. signer of this petition,
 please forward a copy to wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu. If that
 address is inoperative, please use kubi7975@blue.univnorthco.edu.
 This way we can keep track of the lists and organize them. Forward this
 to everyone you know, and help us to keep these programs alive.
 
 Thank you.

Regarding transcendence, WCW has it straightforwardly as "something
they believed was above their heads." Which I think translates in
Cavell into "the human restlessness in the ordinary which leads to a
beyond or before." Still, having got here, who's going to claim to
know where here is?

I can't let the transcendentalism dialogue slip away--this being
something I think about, well, almost all the time.  Here's Emerson, in
his great essay on Shakespeare: "A poet is no rattlebrain, saying what
comes uppermost, and, because he says every thing, saying, at last,
something good.  There is nothing whimsical and fantastic in his
production, but sweet and sad earnest, freighted with the weightiest
convictions, and pointed with the most determined aim which any man or
class knows of in his times."  The essay does everything it possibly can
to demystify Shakespeare's genius, to make it a matter of his sheer
unoriginality: "Great genial power, one would almost say, consists in not
being original at all; in being altogether receptive; in letting the
world do all, and suffering the spirit of the hour to pass unobstructed
through the mind."   Or, elsewhere in the essay: "Thus, all originality
is relative.  Every thinker is retrospective."   The essay is full of
such gems--and it's not at all an "exceptional" essay in the
canon.  Emerson's Transcendentalism--and its the transcendentalism that
haunts many an American writer, including those like Melville and James
and Pound who thought they knew better--is always aware of, say, the
worldedness of what Emerson called (after a "Mrs. B") "the little
beyond."  I go on at infinite length about this elswhere--suffice to say
(in brief) that I think of pragmatism as a project of making explicit
this worlded (Rorty likes to say contingent) transcendentalism.
 
From just a very little beyond--

2. Predictably, we're commissioning an inscription for Bunting (again, for
the Gardens). To be cut in Cumbrian green slate by the David Kindersley
workshop, it'll say, you guessed it, "Words! Pens are too light. Take a
chisel to write". It's a text which DK had on his wall before we asked
him. The various authorities were concerned that it might be seen as an
incitement to vandals. This is a very small town...

What to say further about David Jones, Faber & Faber, and all of that?  Or
how much time would be needed to break them down -- this in the context of
an 800-page book & a permissions budget small enough to make a grown man
cry?  Be that as it may, a tremendous amount of time was spent -- with letters,
faxes, phone calls -- from ourselves & our publishers -- budged them hardly
at all.  On the other hand, notoriously hard presses (Gallimard, Suhrkamp
as examples) came into reasonalbe territory after a couple of exchanges.  So
what to do -- except, as we did, to keep him present through our commentary
and wait for possibly another day.

Johnathan,
 
        To briefly draw from the astro-physicist's 'world-view' that I remain
smitten with;  *ELSEWHERE*  constitutes ONE-HALF of _each and every_
Universe (the future being one quarter, the past being the other quarter,
and the present being the linguistically undefinable origin of each
space-time)!
 
But,
        bringing Emerson's 'Transcendence' and his (accurate?) one-big-eye
caricature, into this thread, makes my knee jerk back to Poetics Journal
#9 where the good Mr. Silliman 'made it so clear' in a letter to Leslie
Scalapino:
 
        "...the linked concepts of objectivity, truth, and transcendence
(all moments in the same discourse), far from being an option or feasible
goal for any or all people, has been rather a strategy for (and by) a
specific cluster, one subset of the grouping WMH [white male het.].  The
point was never objectivity, but rather identity - what subjective state
could imagine a condition through which all other peoples disappear?"
 
        Don't know if these gel together or are in line with the thread...
but: in addressing what exactly we speak of when invoking / defining
'transcendence', I cannot abide overlooking privilege / pass-ability.
 
        Happy Friday,
        Jack

what us inspired, poetical materialist types object to is claims to
transcendence from other poets who tell us that they are in contact with
something "beyond material existence or apart from the universe" or
"something beyond the limits of experience and knowledge" -- that is, few
poets on the list mean by "transcendence" the logical sense of  being an a
priori condition;   and I get myself in an uproar when confronted with claims
that the "poetic" or "inspiration" are something unknowable or apart from
experience, especially since this can usually be translated as "I have access
to this inaccessible realm and you don't" --"
 
Although Messieurs Stroffolino and Levin may already have sufficiently
demurred....
 
An example, and again to return to Spicer. When the dock extends into the
bay, the larger ocean beyond it, the seabirds on it, together with THEIR
possibilities for extension, there are two alternatives. There is
Diebenkorn's, and although I have always enjoyed his work, I have likewise
always been frustrated by it, its studio-bound quality, the constant frame of
the studio in the foreground. The dock is there "as if"; the ocean is there
"as if"; only the studio finally IS. And all within the "guise" of
materiality.
 
The other alternative is, of course, Spicer, but also, according to very
different language models, say, Alan Davies, Lyn Hejinian, Ron Silliman. I am
continually being startled by the writing hand as it enters and exits the
writing frame in THE CELL. Something like the opposite of being uncomfortable
with the material in writing. The suggestion always seems to be (for me: I'm
sure there are countless others) that it's there (here, in the reading) that
that particular material fact ends and some other one(s) begin(s). I get this
same sense, for example, in the abutments Ron whirls into action in DEMO, not
wildly catastrophic, but frequently, much like Spicer's understatement,
requiring real lexical shifts to account for the overload. Within the model
of language being operated, then, we are going somewhere else (not here).
Granted that that isn't a strict sense of "transcendental," but then I think
you'd agree that Emerson's not particularly Kantian. (Though her continual
"bracketing" might qualify Lyn as Husserlian?) The fact is, all of the above
has always made the term "realism" problematic for me, Jonathan's
qualification of pragmatism as worlded/contingent transcendentalism
notwithstanding. Ron?

any recognition of transcendence linked to ritual or repitition misses.
the emersonian argument rests in the recognition that one never really

What about a poetics that attempts to ground its political desire in
precisely those macro-senses? I think we can safely say it won't be the New
Deal. Nonetheless, to "write a republic in gloom," however much cast in
desire, doesn't seem like a minor undertaking.

Subject:      Poetic Jumps
 
For a CD-Rom of our work, The Mechanism of Meaning, the deadline for which
has just about arrived, we are urgently or semi-urgently seeking as many
quintessential  and beyond quintessential poetic jumps (not all poetic jumps
need be poetic) as possible even as we keep these to a minimum--the question
for today then is, what in all justice ought not to be missing from this
list:
 
                        Mind: evaporated birds
                                                -Iluard
 
                        What is Mind?
                        A pine tree, a breeze, a voice
                        In a forgotten painting
                                                - Ikkyu
 
                        Every act is a virgin, even repeated.
                                                -Char
 
                        This virgin, this vivid, this fine today
                        Will it strike us with a blow of its drunken wing
                                                -Mallarmi
 
                        We have two eyes but not yet the ten thousands eyes we
                                          require
                                                -Nietzsche (citation not exact yet)
 
[For those who are unfamiliar with our project (The Mechanism of Meaning,
Abbeville Press, 1988 third edition, out-of-print; to be re-issued soon??),
here are patches of exegesis in regard to two of the sixteen subdivisions
under which the related texts (poetic jumps that fit the concise into the
mould of the succinct may, for present purposes, run up to a couple of
paragraphs in length) will fall.]

Subject:      Article on Lacan & Contemporary Poetry
 
Per the POETICS guidelines for announcing new work, I want to mention
my article
 
"'Desire Pronounced and / Punctuated': Lacan and the Fate of the Poetic
Subject,"
 
which has just come out in AMERICAN IMAGO 52.4 (1995): 405-437.
 
The quote in the title comes from Bob Perelman's "Pastoral," but the paper
itself isn't really LP-centered.  It's about the word "desire" in
contemporary poetry, with attention to Lacan, Robert Hass, & Jorie Graham.
The theoretical issues engaged -- which include the idea of authorship,
the relation of critical theory to contemporary poetry, and the role of
the critic in the reproduction of poetic value -- should be of interest to
many on this list.
 
I'm already sending offprints to some -- CB, Marjorie, Ron, Alan Golding,
Hank Lazer, Maria Damon -- but I'm happy to send additional copies to
anybody.  So backchannel with snail-mail if you think you'd be interested.
 
Cheers,

Subject:      New Work
 
Swallowing my nerves and breathing deeply:
I've put what should be my next chapbook
(assuming I ever get to putting it on paper)
"tsiuf (the act of floating above)"
up on the Web as an Adobe Acrobat file:
http://www.realtime.net/~tsiuf/pdf1-24.pdf
 
It's the first 24 sections (one page each) of what will grow to be a
very long work (I hope).
 
I'd appreciate any feedback, of course...
 
A description from the preface:
 
tsiuf  (the act of floating above) is
 . a mechanized inverse kabbalistic jabberwocky
 . an attempt to wrest meaning from the jaws of chance
 . a hubristic ad-hoc American Jewish I Ching.
 
My goal in writing it: to create a large work in small sections, each part of
which surprises me with unexpected demands.
      The core of the work is a
text, apparently in Hebrew, generated by random processes in a
computer program. The program created a list of ten thousand Hebrew
letters, spaces, and line endings, organized into lines of one to five
"words", each of which is from two to five letters long. The result
was 668 lines of text.
      I examine the words in each line of text as if
it were the statement of an oracle. A few real Hebrew words appear;
for the others, I assume that the creator of the words created them by
combining existing Hebrew words and search the dictionaries for what
those words might have been.
     Once I have translated the Hebrew line, I
then use the translation as the source for a column-long text in
English. (Some Hebrew words appear in the English text, positioned so
that the reader who does not read Hebrew is not missing important
information.)

Emerson's "transcendence" has to do with the mechanics of a self that
is always already other or further. Sometimes called the figure of
outward. As if what you see as containing you comes from somewhere
other than you think.

Hi, don't know if you remember me, my name is Kim Tedrow.
 
I was a student in your "Language Poets" class several years ago (actually
never did finish that damn paper).
 
Nice to see you via this medium.  I'm on the East Coast now, DC area.  Drop
me a line if you're reading around  here - I'll come!!
 
I'm living with my daughter in Maryland, still writing, finally seeing some
publication success (had a poem appear recently in *Cyphers*, Dublin Ireland,
and am appearing in a couple of Web publications).  I moderated the AOL
poetry workshop for a year, but burned out on horrible poetry and people
begging me to critique it for them.  :)
 
Nice to "see you" on the net -  are you still at the University of Minnesota?
 
Regards,
Kim

Peter, I'm curious:  who do you think of as a barred-S poet?  The first one
who came to my mind was Celan, then (in a slight shift of medium) the
English folksinger Nick Drake.  Anyone else?
 
The Rajan quote is really beautiful, btw.

Subject:      Trans Sending
 
Quoth the Price club:
what us inspired, poetical materialist types object to is claims to
transcendence from other poets who tell us that they are in contact
with something "beyond material existence or apart from the universe"
or "something beyond the limits of experience and knowledge" -- that
is, few poets on the list mean by "transcendence" the logical sense of
being an a priori condition;   and I get myself in an uproar when
confronted with claims that the "poetic" or "inspiration" are something
unknowable or apart from experience, especially since this can usually
be translated as "I have access to this inaccessible realm and you
don't" --"
---------------------------------------------------------
 
In the 1950s, what you find by way of transcendentalism is the claim
that in the poem the daily, the local, the particular is connected to
universal (but otherwise not especially visible) stuff. Both Olson and
Duncan make this claim, for example. Ditto Snyder and McClure in
somewhat different fashion(s). Which is why Spicer's god (the baseball
is, after all, not truly BIG but very small and very fast when you're
standing in the box, baby) comes over as such a relief. Or simply
Creeley's manifest common sense.
 
What I read that 50s transcendentalism as is a form of anxiety over the
professional status of poetic knowledge in a world where folks were
rapidly staking claims. Consider, for example, Zukofsky's writing about
a "scientific" definition of poetry. The New Critics were, after all,
poets and very conservative ones, both racist and homophobic in fairly
specific demonstrable ways. Their claim to knowledge was to how to
read, closely, mimicing scientific methodology in their "objective"
examination of a text.
 
Olson, who certainly saw the implications of such intellectual
franchising in his political work in the 1940s, seems to have wavered
at times over his claim, between the historicism of his fishing
archives on the one hand and the "curriculum of the soul" on the other.
For all of it, his best poems are "about" nothing in particular, they
just are.
 
The interesting case, it seems to me, would be Whalen, who seems
genuinely and profoundly spiritual without using it to make claims for
authority in his work. It's simply a fact of the writing, take it or
leave it. (I find it most evident in his use of the noun.) This is a
strategy that has been taken as well by many later writers, Norman
Fischer, Fanny Howe, Steve Benson, Alan Davies, Kit Robinson all being
fine examples.
 
I find it interesting (appalling) that the Apexers have tended to focus
not on a poetic tradition that is imbued with the spiritual, but rather
on one that uses it as a claim (Authorization in the most literal
sense) for the value of the work as such. I think it's that claim to
special knowledge that they're really interested in (worried about).
 
My sense is that Pound was the one really who proposed (at least for
the 'Murkans) that a poet's legitimacy in the modern world depended
upon some status of knowledge. It's the basis for so much hoohah in his
poems, not to mention the crank economics (which seems to have returned
of late in the happy face of Steve Forbes). But what if the value of a
poem has nothing to do with its function as a source for information
("the news") beyond itself? What about all this writing?

Truth in Nashville would seem to be whoever is playing the breakfast
shift at Tootsie's, if I have that name right (the only low-end bar w/
24 hour live music I've ever seen), or whatever bargains are hiding in
the back of that great guitar shop down the street. What the truth is
NOT is that big Caddy that belonged to Elvis at the Country Music Hall
of Fame. (For pure ostenation, I prefer the airplane, the Lisa Marie,
set down there in the parking lot across the street from Graceland,
just waiting for your tour--but that's Memphis, a very different town.)
 
Hatch Show Print, the poster maker for the Grand Ol' Opry and before
that for minstrel shows throughout the south, is also pretty terrific,
tho I believe they've moved around the corner to facilitate more
faceless development, no?

Subject:      Re: Trans Sending
 
I've had this bone to pick for a while now. I think particularly since
Schwartz's transcendent lyric essay in Talisman which coupled logical
transcendence with transcendentalism....
 
This need among transcendentalists to "climb over" history seems a sign of
the exasperated Mind.  Mind exasperated that body won't move - I'm trying
to think of that Lowell George (Little Feat) phrase, but for some reason I
draw a blank...  With the exasperated mind, the _public_ gives way to
-privatization-, to a publicity of  ekstatic spaces. What a hell it must be
to be stranded there, in an elsewhere without recourse, without the
constant shock of labor that forces one back into the real _world_"
 
What I liked about the later Poetics Journals is that they explored this
place without giving in to a monopolar view - particularly "Elsewhere" (I
would give the number of the issue, but my books are packed away as I am
living in a temporary space here in Providence) performed as a bridge to a
condition of reading and writing that is social, political, historical and
"The Person" insisted that the personal co-exist with its context - that in
fact is the person, the site of the private and public.
 
As a matter of poetics, there is a connection between the ekstatic and the
lyric that is almost insufferable. That the lyric claims a space of
recuperation, of loss which in turn idealizes its object, thereby posessing
it, is foolery. It seems to be this same kind of foolery with which
transcendentalists "recuperate," i.e., lose history. What's interesting
though is that when you place this critique upon a very lyric and very
private poet like Niedecker the work comes out of hiding. Not to say that
this critique can _transform_ all lyric poetry. Niedecker just has a
particular "there is work to do" ethic about her work. The material of her
poetry, its construct, along with its work-ethic allows for its critical
transformation. The work goes to work...
 
To this, again, Mr. Silliman:

Ron,
    yes, Grand Old Opry continues to expand and its parking lot
will soon take over the city.  The truth I was referring to was
religious Truth, however.  I am one of the authors of _How to
Mutate and Take over the World_ and the response here should be
interesting.

    Hey Patrick--
     I think the line is
     "You know that you're over the hill
      When your mind makes a promise that your body can't fill"--
     But I don't know if everything called transcendentalism
     (though you may be right about Schwartz--who seems a vulgar transcendent-
       alist to me) need be seen as an attempt to "climb over" history.
       Emerson's notion of history still is quite attractive to me
       (moreso than Pound's "special view"). Like Stein's continuous present.
       A radical questioning of what's CALLED history---about how linear
       notions of history tend to reduce times into period and are often
       a projection of "the present" which of course can not be defined
       as such. The appeal to history and the appeal to "god" or what
       O'Hara called "elaborately sounded structures" may be all of a
       similar piece. Chris S.

I suppose one could define a barred S(ubject) poet in numerous ways.  I
was thinking about writers who blur speech/writing boundaries through
pun, homophonic translation, paragram etc.  In the case of homophonic
translation, for example, the aural phonemes suggest the presence of a
body--a speaking subject with ears and mouth--but the graphic notation is
detached from the speaking subject.  So in a trans such as Zukofsky's "A"
15 (the opening passage of the book of Job) what we read is what we hear,
but what we hear is also not necessarily what we read.  The resulting
negotiation of speech/writing calls into question the notion that the "I"
(unbarred subject) is the originater of its own meaning;  meaning is
similtaneously somatic and textual, hence the self as unified I/body/author
fades but does not disappear, does not die (a la Barthes)...it becomes the
barred S.  This is not to say that the body is not already textual, but
to problematize the relationship between body as text and writing--a kind
of intersemiotic translation between somatic and textual sign systems.
 
If anyone is interested, the next issue of _West Coast Line_ (29/3, to be
distributed within the next month) is publishing an article that I wrote
on bpNichol's translation poetics in relation to the barred S.

Just to take your remark out of context, Patrick, but isn't that an idea
about one kind of lyric? A kind of ex post facto, nostalgic lyric that has
its place in the hillsides of one's early twenties, mid-forties, late
sixties, etc? And Sappho, doesn't she write loss at the moment of loss (Hi
Loss!), to preserve that most ambivalent moment accurately? Wouldn't she
say that love is the cite of that meeting between having and lacking? No?
 
Nostalgic for nostalgia,

Patrick writes : "that the lyric claims a space of recuperation, of loss which
in turn idealizes its object, thereby possessing it, is foolery.  It seems
to be this same kind of foolery with which transcendentalists "recuperate..."
 
This impulse to make an icon or idol of the "love-object" seems as you
say pervasive.  But what would you say about epic, say Dante & Homer,
in which the theme of individual love is not rejected (Beatrice &
Helen/Penelope respectively) - but is reconceived, redefined,
"contextualized".  Yet the theme itself remains at the core of the
poetic effort.
 
The creative struggle between the genres becomes a site for new poetry.
With reference to Ron's comments about 50s transcendence, I would say
the Olson type impulse toward the cosmic is less due to anxiety over
the definition of poetic knowledge than a "push" toward fulfilling
epic demands.  As I see it, the (dubious) argument that the New Critics
were all arch-reactionaries is not really relevant.  Ron's statement
that the best Olson poems are not "about" anything beyond their own making
is classic New Critical theory.  The dilemma for poets in the 50s was not
New Critical pseudo-scientific objectivity but New Critical academic
a-historicism.  The beautiful discoveries of inner architecture people
like Cleanth Brooks discover in Keats & Donne are necessary but not
sufficient means to writing poetry either in the 50s or now.
 
If L poets claim that "instrumental" language supports the power
structure and that therefore "deconstructive" non-referential
language is the essence of liberating poetics, then the M poet
claim that knowledge about the world is necessary & has consequences
seems an inevitable & healthy reaction.  I will leave it to
the s-slash poets to trace the ephemeral ghoul in the hgould,
i.e. the gold gleam in the glum gloom-gum.  - H.Gould

Subject:      dead horses
 
Chris B., Chris S., Jordan, Al, Ron and others:
 
At the risk of beating a dead horse, I do want to say that Chris S'
mention of Emerson is definitely key to the sort-of-discussion of
emerging poetics we've been having in the last week or so. My use of
"transcendentalist" in referring to the Apex poets was definitely meant
as such, and not as "transcendent' more broadly. The status of the
contact between human and transcendent spirit in Emerson's work is
definitely complex--I'm thinking of Duncan's comment about "taking
Emerson dark"--Emerson seems to have that contact sometimes, and at
others fail to have it (Emerson knew all about moodiness, certainly). The
question of the "religion" in Emerson is very complex--he left the
church, of course, and all that stuff about a "transparent eyeball" would
have driven post-Puritan New England wacky. I'm not an expert here, but if I
recall correctly it was definitely NOT New England mainstream
protestant doctrine at the time to suggest that human beings had any sort
of ecstatic oneness with a "spiritual" universe broadly defined--I would
welcome more precise information on this subject.
 
So, in taking a stance of a sort of rebel spiritualism that rejects
the overwhelming influence of mediation (of language, or a church, etc),
the Apex folks are really calling (if indirectly, perhaps) on the same
kind of Emersonian revolution. But I still don't think they're doing it
as sophisticatedly as they need to. And despite Chris S. desire to disagree
here,
I'm going to reassert that my Oedipal metaphor is of significance in
describing the situation. One can't
understand Apex without understanding the hot bed environment of the
UBuffalo Poetics Program--the intensity of a Charles Bernstein or Susan
Howe or Robert Creeley or Dennis Tedlock or Ray Federman seminar, the
amazing poets showing up from all over the world at all times, the
incredible presence of the poetry Rare Books Library with (through its
director Bob Bertholf) its complex interest in the spiritual strains of
American innovative verse perhaps as exemplified by Duncan (although for
me, Ron S. is right--I like Spicer better). The POWER of
language poetry is perhaps more concentrated there at UB than anywhere in
the country, and one can't help but feel it, and perhaps even feel
overwhelmed by it. So what are you going to do if you're a young poet
there? BE a language poet? Be a "second-generation" language poet? Be
something else entirely? I've tended to read Apex's comments on
language writing as "methinks they doth protest too much"--the desire to
deny the influence of language writing in the Apex manifestos tends to
reveal it at every turn. Still, I think they deserve credit for taking on
some significant issues. Who knows if they even still believe some of the
things they said in the first manifesto?
 
        But I have to put my two-cents in (and Jordan Davis: yes you
knew I knew you were kidding!) because I feel like there have been a
whole other range of responses to the particular dilemma of language
poetry's influence, but they don't get any attention. I've been
attempting to deconstruct the image of
"torch-passing" that was recently suggested--that stuff burns, and my
high school experience of pyromaniacs is that sooner or later they always
light THEMSELVES on fire. But I've been on this list about 18 months, and
I've not seen one mention of Charles Borkhuis' excellent article in
ONTHEBUS which discusses possible relations between surrealism and
language writing. I've not seen anyone engage with the incredible
criticism Steve Evans has written on post-language writing in the Oblek
anthology, and Taproot and elsewhere--for me, Evans work has been
the ground from which I began thinking about these issues. I remember one
small discussion of
Juliana Spahr's and Jena Osman's innovative editorial stance in Chain.
Granted, there's no particular reason that people should discuss those
writers anymore than any other interesting writers.
But how many times has Apex been the subject of discussion on this
poetics list? How many times have they
even suddenly provided a name by which a whole generation of poets might
be known? What's that about? Do they really offer the most
significant post-language theories? Does their sensationalism simply make
for more enjoyable e-talk? Do they provide a convenient way to avoid
thinking about the complexities of influence?
 
Rod Smith has warned me not to turn into a "one-issue candidate" on this
problem, and I'm meaning to take his advice any day now. Really I am. But
Rod's In Memory of My Theories marks him as an excellent O-poet, and I'm
hoping that the title of his book does not eventually seem too prophetic.

jonathan levin's comments lead in many good directions. in fact, emerson
was/is deeply misread, largely because of smiley poets/philosophers/
theologians who made him genteel and a gentleman. he is neither. he is
absolutely the core in a range from nietzsche to stein; either would
be "unthinkable" without him. read "experience" careful and you'll
know why duncan thought of himself as absolutely emersonian. transcendence
in emerson is not the mystery behind the veil or the smile in mrs eddy,
but, strictly, recognition of how the mind works when freed of logical
constraint. one great dilemma is olson's anti-emerson stance (excepting
that curious beloit admission), for fenollosa did not see the east
truly but rather a confirmation of emerson's east. one of the odder
points in literary history is that fact that whitman and pound actually
travelled the same road. -ed

ASSIMILATION PUTS TRIBAL CULTURES AT LOSS FOR WORDS
 
Native languages continue to drift toward extinction
 
By Paul Salopek
Tribune Staff Writer
 
        A language vanished on Jan. 15 in Massachusetts when a 76-year old
singer and storyteller named Red Thunder Cloud died.  He was the last known
fluent speaker of Catawba, a Sioux-related language.
        A year ago, it was Northern Pomo that linguists pronounced dead
along with its last native speaker, an octogenarian woman from California.
Eyak, locked inside the head of only one elderly Alaska native, could be
next.  So could Cahto.  Or Coast Miwok.  Or, for that matter, any of the
Amazonian tongues that are thought to be disappearing at the rate of one a
year.
        The world's small, tribal languages---each one representing
millenniums worth of accumulated knowledge and culture---are drifting into
extinction at an unprecedented rate, experts say.
        In the United States---where linguistic experts estimate that 155
of the surviving 175 Native American languages are falling permanently
silent---language death is already well-advanced.
 
 
the article continues on to detail what is being done about the
situation---govt. monies, etc...
 
anyway, yet another recent twist on the pomo... controversy...

This statement is so full of charicature that to respond to it is extremely
difficult without being seen to have bought into its terms. The range of
positions that have been represented in L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, Poetics Journal,
Temblor, etc. can in no way be so simply characterized. & the idea that these
poets disavow the consequence of knowledge is absurd. Also, of the many
ideologies they engage, deconstruction is not one you will find heavily
recurrent. _Apex of the M_ has published three issues, the first one included
a preface which consisted of a "radically transparent" (to use their term)
oedipal attack followed by a bunch of poems, some of which were good. The
second & third issues seem pretty much to have followed the template of the
first with the preferatory attacks becoming less agressive. The "if/then"
construction of the above statement does not follow from even a quick reading
of the texts refered to.

The interesting case, it seems to me, would be Whalen, who seems

strategy that has been taken as well by many later writers, Norman
Fischer, Fanny Howe, Steve Benson, Alan Davies, Kit Robinson all being
fine examples.

Ron, could you talk more about how you see Whalen using the noun?  I think
Snyder may sometimes approach this when he's not caught up in making a
"point," something he'd characterize as "spiritual materialism."  What about
the noun in Oppen?    Another poet I'd look at here is Sobin who so often
brings across a sense of the numinous through his nouns, despite his
assertions that his work has been a sruggle to get away from their static
quality.
 
I'd also be inclined to add Larry Eigner to your list above...

    My statement was reductive, granted.  But I don't think it can be
denied that among the wide range of poetries & theoretical positions
proposed by the langposse, among them has been a specifically political
argument that by emphasizing the materiality, the graininess, of language
itself, Language Poetry resists unthinking conventional processing
of the socio-political status quo (as represented by the New Formerlists
demand for reader-friendly transparency).
    And I think it's ironic that these M poets counter the L position
now, almost a generation later, on political grounds.
    In both cases an appeal is made to a certain approach to style,
rhetoric and content as representing political progress and a healthy
poetics thereby.
    I would argue that all poetry is rhetorically based, that emphasizing
materiality is only another kind of rhetorical maneuver - and that,
paradoxically, rhetoric and technique are only the BEGINNING of poetry.
A good example of how political lenses have been misapplied from
generation unto generation was the article on Willa Cather which
appeared in NYker about six weeks ago (unfortunately I fergit the
author). - Henry Gould

Please add the store I manage, Bridge Street Books, 2814 Pennsylvania Ave NW,
Washington, DC 20007, ph 202 965 5200, to your list of small press oriented
bookstores. We're not on the web yet but that's a possibility.
Bridge Street is a humanities bookstore unusually well stocked in poetry,
cultural theory, philosophy, etc. Mail order has become an increasingly large
percentage of our business, which is a great help as we're facing the
challenge of a new Barnes & Noble superstore 2 blocks away. The store also
hosts readings-- Joan Retallack, Rosmarie Waldrop, Charles Bernstein, Barrett
Watten, Tom Raworth, Stacy Doris, & many others have or will be reading. I
edit & publish _Aerial_ & Edge Books which are supported, in part, by the
store. e-mail add for orders/inquiries is aerialedge@aol.com.

(Given all the scares about internet as the death of the book, it seems

I've run across a few instances of small presses and bookstores marketing
their stock on mailing lists and on the web; I'd like to know more and to
make these resources more widely available, and this convention seems
like a good start.  If you know of major distributors on-line--especially
those dealing with small press books--or poetry bookstores, presses, samisdat

see that they're distributed as widely as I can manage.  I'll get them

Swallowing my nerves and breathing deeply:
I've put what should be my next chapbook
(assuming I ever get to putting it on paper)
"tsiuf (the act of floating above)"
up on the Web as an Adobe Acrobat file:
http://www.realtime.net/~jzitt/tsiuf/pdf1-24.pdf
 
It's the first 24 sections (one page each) of what will grow to be a
very long work (I hope).
 
I'd appreciate any feedback, of course...
 
A description from the preface:
 
tsiuf  (the act of floating above) is
 . a mechanized inverse kabbalistic jabberwocky
 . an attempt to wrest meaning from the jaws of chance
 . a hubristic ad-hoc American Jewish I Ching.
 
My goal in writing it: to create a large work in small sections, each part of
which surprises me with unexpected demands.
      The core of the work is a
text, apparently in Hebrew, generated by random processes in a
computer program. The program created a list of ten thousand Hebrew
letters, spaces, and line endings, organized into lines of one to five
"words", each of which is from two to five letters long. The result
was 668 lines of text.
      I examine the words in each line of text as if
it were the statement of an oracle. A few real Hebrew words appear;
for the others, I assume that the creator of the words created them by
combining existing Hebrew words and search the dictionaries for what
those words might have been.
     Once I have translated the Hebrew line, I
then use the translation as the source for a column-long text in
English. (Some Hebrew words appear in the English text, positioned so
that the reader who does not read Hebrew is not missing important
information.)

Subject:      dead horses, live theories
 
Mark,
 
Would that every post to this list had the passion and white-hot
intensity of thought of yours so often have. However, this aside,
 
"But I've been on this list about 18 months, and I've not seen one
mention of Charles Borkhuis' excellent article in ONTHEBUS which
discusses possible relations between surrealism and language writing.
I've not seen anyone engage with the incredible criticism Steve Evans
has written on post-language writing in the Oblek anthology...
But how many times has Apex been the subject of discussion on this
poetics list? How many times have they even suddenly provided a name by
which a whole generation of poets might be known? What's that about? Do
they really offer the most significant post-language theories? Does
their sensationalism simply make for more enjoyable e-talk? Do they
provide a convenient way to avoid thinking about the complexities of
influence?"
 
brings up a couple of thoughts. The first being that I recall
specifically discussing Steve Evans wonderful work from The New Coast
(I agree with you about its importance) here and elsewhere. The second
being that I don't think people (me, anyway) generalize from the
Apexers to "a whole generation" (not in your dreams, Lew), but that
what they have done/are doing is nonetheless important simply for
having a coherent shape to it, whatever the internal contradictions and
problematics (I'll return to this below). Third, I've never even seen
ONTHEBUS (nor, for that matter, do I recall seeing it even mentioned
previously here or elsewhere -- is it a magazine, a book or what?), so
I suspect that the lack of discussion re Borkhuis' article may follow
not from lack of interest but distribution.
 
Leading, instanter, to further thoughts:
Certainly there's a powerful and problematic betwixt Lpoetry and
surrealism (most carefully sketched out by B Watten in Total Syntax),
both in terms of the work and as a model of social formation. Poets who
took surrealism as a direct influence: Watten certainly, Davies
certainly, Estrin certainly -- tho I think Jerry at first saw
surrealism as a method of critiquing the program of the lpoets avant la
lettre -- many others (Grenier might not acknowledge it, but it's
clearest in the "scribble" texts how much of the back brain work is
exactly what he's after)
 
Our friends the M poets, even by virtue of being wrong, have done more
(and better) at providing a consistent shape to their argument than
anyone else in what Steve Evans (I think it was he) christened "G2"
[which, by the by, is where his work was discussed, if you're checking
the EPC archives] and there's an enormous power to that.
 
One of the interesting strains I've picked up from several "G2" or
"later in the alphabet" poets has been a sense, especially re lpoetry
and the Apexers, that to have a shape (it does not have to be so
extensive as to qualify as a program) is to make a case for power as
such and that power per se is not attractive and that they'd rather
not. From my perspective, this echoes a lot of what I heard in
nonprofit and other voluntary association groups in the early 1970s, in
particular (remember affinity groups), all those folks still scarred
then by the bad taste of internicine warfare within SDS and the
atrocious sexual politics of the 60s antiwar movement. But as Foucault
et al could have told them (could tell us now), power doesn't go away,
it just reconstitutes itself Elsewhere (very much in the sense of that
word as used as a theme for an issue of Poetics Journal). The Apexers
are the only group who have, as a group, addressed power directly in
their critical writings. More power to them.

Charles Smith,
 
 
"Ron, could you talk more about how you see Whalen using the noun?  I
think Snyder may sometimes approach this when he's not caught up in
making a "point," something he'd characterize as "spiritual
materialism."  What about the noun in Oppen?    Another poet I'd look
at here is Sobin who so often brings across a sense of the numinous
through his nouns, despite his assertions that his work has been a
sruggle to get away from their static quality.
 
I'd also be inclined to add Larry Eigner to your list above..." (your
ellipsis)
 
---
 
I'd thought of Larry as I wrote my original comments, actually. And
Oppen I can see, though I'd never characterize him as a spiritual poet.
However, I do seem to be allergic to Sobin, who strikes me as precious
and pompous and tries for musicality with a very tin ear.
 
Turning to Whalen (a chance to see if, having moved this past week, my
books are in enough order yet to find something), I get lost, as always
I do, in On Bear's Head. A lot of his work doesn't translate easily to
email (or even HTML), but here's an example of what I was getting at:
 
MYSTERIES OF 1961
 
Lazy tongs
Jacobs ladder
magnetized flywheel
gyroscope
folding mesh ring basket
 
    *
 
Mr KNIBX, a sinister
 
    *
 
"_A_ is for jelly,
 _B_ is for Jell-O"
 
    *
 
"You are the how
 they call panic"
 
-------------------------------
 
This is a text just crying for New Critical exposition, no? Tho, as
somebody noted awhile back, it's got that "not about anything, it just
is" quality all over.  Actually, I read it as a list, moving outward
from tiny phrases to the last two sections which I think function as
equivalents to those early short lines with greater weight. There is,
in Whalen's work, an absolute opacity to the nominal that is both
insisted on (KNIBX) and permitted, rather than imposed (contrast here
with the heroic backlighting of a Sobin or, in some places, Snyder)
 
The poem shifts between emotional states (as do so many of Whalen's,
and so often in just this direction) from "lazy" to "panic." The next
to last section is an index of the slightest shifts (from jelly to
Jell-O in antialphabetical order) as ontologically absolute. What
exactly IS that object that appears to be described in the first stanza
and why is Mr KNIBX sinister? What I note, thinking of Whalen as a
spiritual poet, is how integral the word "lazy" is to "tongs" and how
"how" as a noun has the same character (no going after the precious,
but picking up an accent that is noted but not named).

re Ron's remarks on Whalen's work being both spiritual and nominal,
perhaps the relationship comes from the nature of zen spirituality, which
proceeds from attention to surroundings, which for anyone includes
language as part of surroundings.  tracking surroundings.  quiet sitting
and other zen exercises.  this is in all of whalen's poetry, I think,
though my own experiences argue to me that his time in japan, where
language was a dominant part of his environment, would have heightened
it.  but zen would be spiritual, not transcendent, to make an odious
distinction.

"Mysteries of 1961" - a New Critical Roach
 
    Mr. Whalen's short lyric, "Mysteries of 1961", creates dramatic
tension by means of a delicate balancing of preschool perceptions
(ironically "in quotation marks") with a melange of adult concerns
specific to the early 60s (i.e. lazy tongs, a combination machine shop
kitchenware utensil; Jacobs Ladder, a reference of course to Sunday
school games prevalent at that time; and m. flywheel, gyroscope
and folding mesh ring basket, all three of these last uniting
high technology with low comedy (kitchenware, pet store, toy).
The poem pivots on an ironic coincidentia oppositorum, that is,
Mr KNIBX, an unknown sinister mad scientist who sounds about as sinister
as a cartoon character on a cereal box.  The final couplet,
"You are the how/they call panic" unites a child's ungrammatical
mis-statement with an allusion to Pan, panic, and (inevitable
for that time) the ATOMIC BOMB.  These unmysterious "mysteries"
of passing childhood & passing history become unaccountably
and truly MYSTERIOUS when set within the urn-like frame of
the poetic conundrum.  Huh. Yeah well.

Comments: cc: RoseRead@aol.com
 
I'm gonna jump in here with a comment on the Philip Whalen poem Ron Silliman
posted, "Mysteries of 1961".
How does a poem like this work or fail to work?  I have to assume these
fragments carry associations for Whalen that they do not carry for us, and
that they all have something to do with 1961.  If that's not true, then the
poem is a trick, and it's easy enough to make a fool of even the best reader.
So you set out to write a poem composed of references the reader will not get
--- why?  It can work, if the reader can get some sense of the tone, and
maybe some sense not of the individual bits but how they come together for
the poet.  It is poetry by example.  This all adds up to something for Philip
Whalen, or fails to in a way he finds just as interesting.  If he can convey
_that_ then the reader can get something without knowing what it's really all
about; you get an example, what it's like to have things like this in your
head, trying to make sense of them, trying not to, trying to remember 1961 or
trying to forget it.  Whatever.
So there _is_ a sort of failure of reference in a poem like this and it's
deliberate.  The reasons for not evoking a similar state of mind with
references the reader can understand?  Who knows --- maybe Whalen just felt
compelled to deal with material that is absolutely personal and didn't like
explaining it all --- or maybe he didn't want to explain it because he wants
to have a little privacy.  And yet he wrote it, so he must hope his state of
mind comes through anyway, and must hope that's enough to make a poem.
 
Ron Silliman sez there is an "absolute opacity of the nominal" here.
 "Absolute" Ron?  You seem to speak English, seem to be able to figure out
which are the nouns and which the adjectives (are we less avante garde when
it comes to the parts of speech) --- even find some of the latter essential
to the former, as you say "lazy" is to "tongs".  Oh but you don't mean
essential semantically, no, because then "tongs" wouldn't be absolutely
opaque, I guess, and maybe the poem would be about something.  Maybe the
adjectives, verbs, etc. are doing all the work, and only the nouns fail to
refer.  That _would_ be interesting.
Btw, can't wait to tell my niece that sometimes the difference between jelly
and Jell-O is "ontologically absolute".  Anyone making a sandwich would have
to agree.
Alright, not taking any more time on this, just wanted some kind of dissent
on the record.  Full-dress mock battles to come.

It's true that power is reconstitutive, or constitutive, or constructive, as
well as oppressive but I think what power there is to be gotten vis a vis
poetry these days is in question. The unironic grab for power re _Apex_ has
gotten them some attention but has it gotten them respect? Not in the fairly
large circle I travel in, which include a lot of folks who don't particularly
consider themselves friends of the American Tree, as well as many who do.
 
If we're talking abt audience here, we've done fairly well in DC. We now have
three reading series in different locations with an average attendance of 25
to 50 people, not tons, but 5 years ago Tom Raworth read for 7 people
(tremendous reading too), & from what I can see NYC isn't much different
these days, maybe slightly larger numbers. There's also a certain amount of
truck with the other poetry communities in town, i.e. a number of us have
read in places 5 years ago we wouldn't have, the communities were much more
seperate.
 
If we're talking about grants, that seems to be disappearing. I received a
$5,000 grant from DC last year which was reduced to $1,000 due to the budget
crisis. They've now cut the grants program back & are going to be giving out
fewer grants in the amount of $2,000. 15 years ago four DC American Tree gen
writers received NEA's in the same year for, I believe $10,000,
might have been more, which wld of course be equivalent to receiveing $20,000
now. & we know what's happening with the NEA.
 
The universities ain't doin' the support thing either. I know of one Buffalo
graduate which has a full-time job in poetry. Everybody else is scrambling
for adjunct jobs at $2,000 a class (or less) which helps but. Many are simply
opting out of the university.
 
So, we do the poetry because we enjoy it & the people involved in it-- the
work is supported at that level, but the idea that anything "material" is to
be gotten from it is even farther off than it was just 10 or 15 years ago.
I'm not claiming that there's no money in poetry, or that things were so
great in the seventies or eighties, but there was a much greater possibility
of having your work supported by some type of institution-- Jerome Sala once
sd to me "The idea that there's no money in poetry is just as wrong as the
idea that there's a lot of money in poetry."
 
There also seems to me a class question here. A number of G1 folks went to
Harvard or Yale. I know of one promising younger writer there now, she'll
probably get a job. Not necessarily a good job. Things can't be reduced to
that, but neither can one pretend it doesn't matter. There's also a parallel
here between first & second gen NY school-- Ashbery & O'Hara went to Harvard,
Berrigan, Mayer, Padgett, etc didn't.
 
What this means is folks in our gen ARE exceedingly cynical abt power. & most
of them see where it is-- it's in those "Dazzling Corporate Profits" of
NYTimes & Wall Street Journal headlines, not in the personnages of the poets
10 to 30 years older than us-- everyone I know is having a hard time getting
by because decisions were made at the top levels of govt & business 20 years
ago that the population was costing too much. So to see someone expending
energy attacking a poet because they got a job, well, save it for the gym,
kid (if you can afford one, that is).
 
The recent Andrew Ross book _The Chicago Gangster Theory of Life_ outlines
the ideology of this lunacy better than any one piece I've seen (though
Chomsky is best for the details)-- we seem to have decided, or corporate
propoganda decided for us, somewhere along the line, that there's not enough
to go around. This doesn't seem an accurate assumption to make. The resources
are there for people to live quite well, & not just Americans, if the
assumption was that people mattered more than money.

Subject:      Re: dead horses, live theories
 
Since Rod Smith has connected writing life with general US economic situation,
I'd like to ask a general question along these lines.  Tonight I'm supposed
to meet with a group of writers who want to do something, be more
politically active.  It's our first meeting.  My question: what would
be the most useful & effective way for writers/artists AS ARTISTS to
speak up about the situation as Rod outlined it (which outline I'm
in agreement with, except in my view "institutional support" for poets
has caused at least as much harm as good).
 
I say what would be most effective for people AS ARTISTS because I think
I already know the answer as far as people AS CITIZENS - there's a world
of mutual aid disaster relief community service out there to be done.
 
AS ARTISTS my recurrent thought over the past too many years has been
to come up with some kind of extended manifesto/paper, along the lines
of the Catholic Bishops statement on the economy which was done about
10 years ago & which is still relevant.  The good Bishops centered on
3 basic concepts as I understand it : the rights of poor people;
the common good as a criterion of social justice; and the rights of
people as workers.  The Bishops document would be as good an antidote
to phony Buchananisms and divisive hate-mongering as any I know of.
 
But my 2nd recurrent thought whenever this feeble urge comes over me
is a sense of futility.  All politics is local, organizational, and
founded in PR; we could spend 6 months coming up with a document nobody
would read anyway.
 
Any thoughts on this?  What about using an internetwork like this to
develop a collective document?  [I hear the shivers & shakes out there.]
I'm sure this particular list is the wrong venue.  I know about the
writers network that focused on defeating the NEA attacks in Congress,
that's probably more relevant to such a project.
 
I realize this is not poetics; please respond directly to me unless
you feel it really must be said to poetics list.  I'm at Henry_Gould@
brown.edu.  And any objections to discussing this on poetics will
meet with my full assent.
 
In my view artists have no special cachet when it comes to political
& social values; nor are they required in their art to deal with
politics at all.  But they COULD speak about the relationship between
art; the good life; and social justice.  And as we all know these
three interrelated issues took Marx a long way...
 
What should I bring to this meeting tonight? - Henry Gould

Re Patrick Foley on Whalen. Figuring out the poet's feelings
associations is a strategy that the poem resists. Something to be
learned from that is that the poem doesn't fail, but the strategy
does. Put it another way, it was never meant to sit 'that' exam.

A very interesting exchance between Ron and Rod.  I'm not sure about the
"class" difference between G1 and G2, though.  Did all that many G1 folks
really go to Harvard and Yale?  In any case, I'm not sure it makes that
much difference any more (at least in terms of getting a job in poetry)
whether one went to Harvard and Yale or, say, Buffalo.  (It clearly made
a much bigger difference in the 1950s or 60s).  Anyway, the relationship
of class and education is tricky--what was Olson's "class"?
(Although he was a Wesleyan and Harvard student).  For that matter, what
was Berryman's class (certainly not the same as Lowell's, but they ended
up in much the same place, institutionally).

Subject:      Re: dead horses, live theories
 
    Rod Smith raises some extremely provocative questions about class.
    The analogy between the 50's (Ashes, O'H) and the 60's (Mayer, Berrigan)
    and the g1 vs. g2. is perhaps a good starting place, but it's severely
    complex. On of the complicating factors, for me, has been that while
    the first generation NYSCHOOL did not claim to be as POLITICALLY RADICAL
    (at least not programmatically, but more incidentally, or as Ashes said
     "we merely refuse the government it's right to exist), the first wave
    L poets did claim to be so---despite (or perhaps BECAUSE?) the class
    similarities (I know this is a generalization, but I'm trying to extend
    on Rod's point--and there is at least SOME truth to it that might be
    usefully explored).
    This is where it seems history becomes a question (around $$$$$$$ rather
    than around Foucaultian power which EVERYBODY HAS NO MATTER WHAT, yippee!)
    And why I don't think the analogy holds. For, unlike today, the generation
    of Mayer, etc. (mid to late 60's) saw a general loosening up of culture.
    Many really thought the system (which now goes under the more benign name
    of "the world market") was gonna fail. More affordable colleges opened
    up to classes, races and genders that had previously been excluded.
    The Allen anthology was being reprinted over and over. Being from the
    lower classes, and flaunting bohemian lifestyles, was NOT considered
    a handicap. With the oil crisis, the bicentenial clampdown, the erection
    of RAYGON, things clamped down severely. And things have been in general
    TRYING to return to the pre 60's elitism and pieties and increasing
    "incentives" for being uptight, and a growing underclass that includes
    many college educated people. An example re college: My late mother
    (b. 1942) wanted to go to college severely, and was not able to (due
    to class, but also to some extent gender). Because she worked her ass
    off, I was able in the early 80's to do so. In the five years I was in
    college, the tuition (i.e. price) MORE THAN DOUBLED. Had I been 10 years
    younger, it's probable that I would not have been able to go to college.
    I base this on the FACT that many of the current generation of college
    kids are having to drop out (and not like GINSBERG AND KEROAUC to go
    "on the road" out of CHOICE)--because of cut backs to publically funded
    schools. So, how does this SAME OLD STORY relate to the "battle over
    power in the poetic superstructure"?????n On one level, it may account
    for the tone of desperation, of divisiness, the directionlessness even
    of younger poets. Sure, poets have been desperate, self-pitying and
    divisive way before. John Berryman almost tried to commit suicide in
    his mid 20's (during World War II) because Harvard wouldn't rehire him.
    Today, one could cynically let out a communal cry: "OH, POOR JOHN!"
    Yet, at least in the 60's---despite many of the poetry wars going on,
    there seemed to be at least some shared feeling towards a common
    EXTRA-LITERARY enemy; and also a sense that we hurt ourselves more to
    be sequestered in out little boxes, in the suburbs, what have you....
    What I would like to see more from my generation (given the systemic
    limitations) is at least an attempt to reach out more rather than mimic
    the tone of divisiness. For instance, re the whole M question. Yes,
    their polemics have been divisive in a way. But what is the point in
    meeting this divisiness with STILL MORE DIVISIVENESS??????????????
    This is a sinking to the level that is hard to avoid, but I would
    like to try, and would like to be CHECKED by others, or CALLED by others
    when I lapse into it. I'LL CHECK YOU IF YOU CHECK ME. I mean, aesthetic
    differences NEED NOT always be POLITICAL differences. The problem with
    the POLITICAL PROGRAM that seems to follow from an assumption that
    DISJUNCTIVE POETIC FORMS is in itself POLITICAL is perhaps partly to
    blame for the "reaction" of the M poets. I DO NOT see a NECESSARY
    connection between the aesthetics propounded by the M (or by the Ed
    Foster group for that matter) and a political conservatisim or yeegahds
    "the christian right". If the question really is politics, isn't it
    possible that (andit seems even MORE OF A NECESSITY TODAY than it was
    when the first gen. L poets were publishing their first books; the
    economic/cultural bankruptcy provides a climate even more threatening
    to poetry and to POETS now than then----the divisiveness of the L
    POETS in the 70's and 80's is a luxury we CAN NO LONGER AFFORD as,
    to their credit, I think Charles and others have recognized recently).
    I do not consider myself an M POET, but at the same time I DO respect
    them, ROD, and not just because they published me. In the 50's the
    coalition that Donald Allen managed to put together did manage to
    in some ways, at least temporarily, break the hegemony of the
    mainstream pieties. Why isn't that possible today????????????

that is, Rod's list of political sources is great, but charged with pathos..

Found this sentence in John Tytell, _Ezra Pound: The Solitary Volcano_
(New York: Doubleday, 1987), p. 299, and wonder if anyone knows more about
it or has a comment:
 
        Another young poet, Robert Duncan, wrote sustaining certain
        of Pound's more rabid views, commenting that `minorities of
        any kind are symptoms like boils, cancers,' signs of the
        breakdown of the body politic."
 
No citation is given but presumably the quoted line comes from a letter
of Duncan's to Pound.

Subject:      Re: Trans Sending
 
Tony,
 
I agree, Whalen's poem resists --- well what exactly does it resist?  The
term "reticence" used to be used commonly --- the word everyone reached for
when faced with Elizabeth Bishop's poetry.  (Linda Gregg says something
similar about Dickinson.)  You want to say Whalen's resistance is not a sort
of reticence, I guess.  I'll go along with that.  Let's say it _is_
different.  Neither would I want to insist that this poem is about Whalen's
state-of-mind; that was a sort of place-holder in my note.  I will even try
to go along with the poem not being about anything at all --- which I suspect
is the secret handshake on this list.  It is an opportunity for the reader to
have a linguistic --- is that too narrow? --- experience.  I can go along
with that too, I guess.  But I'm going to have trouble if the poem's language
is not, in those circumstances, expected to do everything language does, and
that includes reference, boys.  What Wittgenstein called how language & the
world _fit_.  Short of that, we're talking about sound, we're talking about
music made with words as sounds, and that is just not how we hear a language
we speak.
 
(There is a difference every poet understands between writing about himself
and writing about the thing.  When no candidates come to the reader's mind
for the poem's object --- Silliman can't think of what the first strophe
could be describing, and the few ideas I've had today I'd have to ponder a
while --- it is natural to assume the poet is in his own head, or at least
that he is caressing and not grasping the things of the world (Kafka's
distinction, and Rilke's too, I think).  Hence, I talked as if Whalen was
evoking a state-of-mind.)
 
Alright, no conclusion.  I'm not saying I like or dislike or even understand
what Philip Whalen has given us.  I just don't want to hear a lot of talk
about "ontological" this and that, when we could be talking about the poem.
 
Let me ask you, Tony, what's it all for?  Are you that interested in poem's
that give you no clue what the poet's feelings, experiences, ideas are?  I
assume when you say a poem resists, you mean more, you mean resists
completely --- or do you subscribe to some aesthetic of difficulty we think
of now as modernist?  Is a poem a game with words?  A philosophical
experiment with language?  These things are possible, certainly, and they are
probably present in all poems to a degree --- sitting down to a blank piece
of paper I often get a sort of metaphysical vertigo.  But they are not the
whole ballgame.  I can't say the most interesting thing I ever found in a
poem was a couple words in reverse alphabetical order.

I hear symptoms of distress at something deemed or felt to be missing
 what's not there to be had. Remember Lichtenstein or Warhol?  Rauschenberg's white canvases?
Cage?
The arts, as arts of expression, underwent something I suppose was
interesting to most people in and around 1960. So, I'm  not surprised
(rather pleased) to have a Whalen 1961 poem quoted here that has a
similar ring. And hear it ring the same alarm bells abt --- where's the
art gone  (HELLLLLLPPPPP)! The strategies needed for listening to
this piece of Whalen that yield pleasure are those of listening to a
list, first, of an array that didn't much get into poems, because not
symbolic, not in the Romantic canon of highly charged roses,
volcanoes, hurdy-gurdy players, brooks ... so working against a genre
of lyric poem and that that still works is amazing, but apparently
true, or so it appears from this wee conversation.
     I suppose I should go on and say more about the non-list
parts, but I'm still bewildered myself coming back into this Poetics
List's conversation and seemingly going back to difficulties of thirty-five
years ago. I really must have misssed something since being off-line
for two months, a time-warp occurred?
         Of course I'm interested in that there poem, being of an age
to have wanted to write anything as good as that. I love
sound-values overwhelming the word-meanings. I cherish any device of
that kind that will produce as much disturbance in listeners that
believe that what words do is precise sense. But not always in every
poem.
          I remember arguing with my father who used to say how cd
anyone like my poems, because they were meaningless? Anyone who liked
them and told me so must be a flatterer and a charlatan, because
there was nothing to like. There are some curious assumptions thereto
based on expectations built on poems written before 1961.
Sad thing is new poems require new readings, either that or pshaws of
cranky dismissal. Right here and now, off the cuff, a defence of
everything from Pop onwards seems too large a task to undertake. But
that is what is at issue.

Chris Beach writes:  I'm not sure about the "class" difference between
G1 and G2, though.  Did all that many G1 folks really go to Harvard and
Yale?  In any case, I'm not sure it makes that much difference any more
(at least in terms of getting a job in poetry) whether one went to
Harvard and Yale or, say, Buffalo.  (It clearly made a much bigger
difference in the 1950s or 60s).  Anyway, the relationship of class and
education is tricky--what was Olson's "class"? (Although he was a
Wesleyan and Harvard student).  For that matter, what was Berryman's
class (certainly not the same as Lowell's, but they ended up in much
the same place, institutionally).
------------------
 
Actually, while G/zero or whatever you might call it went heavily to
Harvard, G1 (following the Evans carbon dating system here) aka langpo
etc was much more apt to have gone to Berkeley: Watten, Armantrout,
Melnick, Bromige, Ratcliffe, Scalapino, Shurin, your humble
correspondent here, Perelman (much much later), etc. Which, unlike
Harvard and Yale, is a public institution, which meant that poor white
trash like myself could get in if we could swing it. While some of
those folks come from fairly successful parents, others like Rae and
myself come from pretty close to the edge of the lumpen proletariat,
families looking upward to see the blue collar folks who in the 1950s
looked like they might be doin' okay.
 
But there's an enormous number of elements that go into a category like
class, even if one still adopts a static conception of that and ignores
the fact that only 11 percent of the US workforce is involved in
manufacturing these days. There's class background, class stance, class
orientation and lots of struggle around all these all the time. In many
senses, a lot of folks whose parents were doctors, teachers, ministers,
etc. (which includes LOTS of writers, whatever the aesthetic tendency)
-- folks who fall not into the capitalist class but into that
in-between professional category -- struggle with their own sense of
"privilege." It strikes me that people deal with growing up in a class
society much like they do growing up in a racist and sexist one --
either they struggle with it consciously (and constantly) all their
lives or they don't. I'm for the folks who struggle, regardless of
where they came from.

Selected blurbs:
 
 
Thad Ziolkowski's poetry stands firmly on a ledge, at the slippery end of
an artifice all but consumed by arson. Or maybe his poetry is that edge. Or
the night that beckons. A still falling powder, artfully arranged into
lines   with ice underneath. But don't look back, or down. The building's
all but gone. And the next step's the steep one.
 
        Ben Friedlander
 
 
Like Kurt Schwitters before him, Thad Ziolkowski has designed a house out
of found objects and fragments, echoes of the language of the law, of
patriotism, the news such as we receive it, idioms floating in the air.
Through this tableau, this mirror-house, we pass, only to discover that
going left takes us right, inside means outside, and in the attic we find
what was hidden in the basement. Nothing is to be taken for granted.
Nothing is what it so publicly seems or proclaims. Our attention is thereby
tested and renewed, our sense of direction challenged. Did I mention that
it is a burning house? He set the fire himself.
 
        Michael Palmer
 
 
Ziolkowski's poems, propelled by Dickinsonian hymnody, build out of such
particulars, as a preposition newly read, a lyric we can almost sing along
to without ever before having heard it. Like listening to "rare / live
tapes // of, as well as by, all that happens," one reads here of "the
people / who though," and comes to see, as if it had never before been so
enacted, the sheer fact of relation   that syntax which is the problem in
which we float in these poems, that "something / within which something
else originates."

NEW Ziolkowski, Moxley, & Davies YES!
 
Ron--
Liked yr post on class very much. Two of my heroes, Cage & Oppen, were
college drop outs.
 
Chris B--
As I said, the Harvard thing isn't something I wld overemphasize, however,
you asked who among G1 went there -- Bernstein, Hejinian, & Palmer all went
there.
Possibly the three biggest name language poets (I know I know Michael's not a
language poet). Andrews
was there as a grad student. & Susan Howe's father taught there, was head of
the Eng Dept. for a number of years I believe. Aside from Olson, Ashbery,
O'Hara, Creeley was also there during WWII. & Burroghs I think dropped out?
Pretty good school I'd say. Any "major poets" go to Princeton? Actually, the
question falls somewhere between "privilege" & some kind of odd
synchronicity-- Providence & the Bay area being two other places that seem to
have harbored more than any reasonably expected share of poetic talent.
Actually, a populace flows through the yard. . .
 
Chris S--
I think the question of why L-poets were more politically radical, at least
overtly, than NYS (other than just "sensibility") had to do with what was
going on in the universities generally in the seventies/early eighties--
"theory" was taking over, so it was something they engaged & did it quite
well I believe. But as I think has been sd here before, it, theory, means
something quite different now.
 
I'm sorry if I seemed too dismissive of the M, Chris. But I think my
statement of the general reaction to their first few manifestoes was
accurate. I also said I thought a number of the poems they published were
good. & I've said I like Pam R's work, 'specially the Burning Deck book. & I
also think Lew D's poem in oblek 12 is interesting. I understand concerns abt
divisiveness
but it shouldn't stop one from stating opinions, should it? OK, maybe some
opinions some of the time. . .
 
Maybe we can't do what the Allen did because they already did it for us, but
you can be sure that if we stop for even a short while it wld have to be done
all over again. & good point you made abt the beats, someone sd somewhere
"they weren't high school drop outs, they were grad school drop outs!"
 
--Rod
 
PS-- the term "biggest name" above being based on my perception of who's
known, & even occasionally read, outside of their respective communities.
Armantrout, Silliman, Scalapino being examples of "big names" that didn't go
to Harvard.

Unhappy booksellers call on a radical union to get their fair share
 
By Larissa Comis
 
Employees at Borders are unhappy with their wages and benefits. Managers have
hired a union-busting law firm. Where do the workers turn?
To the Wobblies.
Founded in 1905 by Big Bill Haywood, the Industrial Workers of the World (aka
the IWW, or the Wobblies) is an organization best-known for its industrial
sabotage and direct action campaigns. The IWW is gaining in strength in
Philadelphia. It recently
purchased a new union hall, the Fletcher Center, in North Philadelphia and has
offices in University City.
Management's response?
Managers at Borders are opposed to the unionization and have hired a well-known
union-busting law firm out of Pittsburgh to represent the company in
negotiations.
Bob Helms, a representative of the Philadelphia branch of the national IWW,
believes that the involvement of Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler and Krupman is not
a good sign for the labor side of negotiations.
"This doesn't bode well... I'm too experienced to be anything but cynical at
this time. I've seen union-busters at work and they are sleazebags" says Helms.
On the other hand, James Withrow, a union organizer and Borders bookseller, is
not so discouraged by the work of the law firm.
"Their job so far has been to tell Borders what their legal obligations are,
and I think that is fine," says Withrow.
Regina Hertzig, a lawyer in the labor department of Freedman and Lorry, is
representing the IWW in labor negotiations. She says that she will not draw
conclusions about the plans of management according to whom they choose as
counsel.
Withrow says that employee relations with management are on good terms. "I
don't want people to feel that this is an anti-Borders campaign... There's
nothing wrong with our management at this store. Borders Book Shops are run by
a fairly
enlightened group of individuals," says Withrow.
However, Withrow is dissatisfied with the conditions for Borders workers in the
Center City store and throughout the country.
"The real problem is with the wages and benefits within the bookstore
industry... Unless other bookstore chains are affected by an effort like this,
we're not going to make much more than we do now," says Withrow.
He was unwilling to comment about what contact, if any, the Center City
employees have had with workers from other stores.
Helms says that he is delighted with the decision of the Borders workers to go
to Wobbly and offers his full support.
"The branch is here in solidarity with the booksellers, but the decisions they
make as the booksellers will be made by the people working at the bookstore,"
says Helms.
It is this flexibility that appeals to the Borders workers."The IWW, instead of
filling us with what our union's objectives should be, has instead been there
only for advice and support. Their respect for anarchy translates into a
decentralized
approach," says Withrow.
Withrow and his co-workers chose to join the IWW instead of forming their own
union. "There's not a booksellers union. We wanted to form one, but we didn't
want to be left completely without an affiliation," says Withrow.
The experience of the IWW, and the help it can offer the Borders workers in
navigating national labor laws, also appealed to the Borders employees. "We
picked the IWW to affiliate with because the IWW members have spent so much
time thinking
about how a union should be run," says Withrow.
The majority of the 43 Borders employees who are eligible to join the union
signed the IWW membership cards, says Withrow. Despite this broad support, the
workers at Borders must still petition the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) and conduct a silent vote to elect a union to represent them, says
Withrow.
The management at Borders has the ability to stall the vote by taking issue
with the petition, explains Hertzig. For instance, she says that they may claim
that there is not commonality among workers. At this point, Hertzig says that
they have not
found out from management what they think of the petition. If they do take
issue, there will be a hearing with the NLRB to decide if and when there will
be a silent ballot by the workers.
Borders managers were unavailable for comment.
Withrow is optimistic that the parties can avoid the Feb. 27 hearing. "There
may not even be a hearing because Borders and the union may just agree on the
conditions of the election. They are being very fair about this. It could be far
worse," says Withrow.
If the majority of the Borders workers vote to be represented by the IWW, then,
Helms says, "the IWW will have exclusive rights to represent the 43 workers in
talks."
Although the history of the IWW is steeped in obstructing methods of production
to hurt the bosses, Withrow says that right now, such measures are not in the
workers' agenda.
"In our meetings, the greater portion of the time has been spent talking
seriously about keeping and raising Borders' high standards for meeting
customers' needs," says Withrow.

Rod Smith asks what poets (he says major but what does that mean) went to
Princeton:
 
Lewis MacAdams Jr, John Godfrey, John Koethe
(all at the same time)
 
does that represent a school?
 
One should note, also, that Harvard is a very large school.  So is
Berkeley (and Columbia, for that matter).
 
Density matters.

Subject:      how many Republicans
 
Plus a few extra to run for President with lightbulbs over their heads
to stand for ideas.
 
I went to my "political get active" meeting last night.  Somebody said
they were driving in a car & thinking how distant & controlled nature
has become in industrial culture; they talked about how Americans are
put in a mental box by treating themselves as special.  I thought: these
are not new or especially great ideas, but maybe they're a faint example
of what artists or writers have to contribute to social debate : the
idea that we can't live together without imagination - which imagines
another future, a sympathetic or compassionate imagination, which
creates even the possibility of alternatives.  The same person said
he felt culture seemed inert, unable to respond to what's happening,
and that once the human spirit left religion and entered art - now it's
leaving art - where's it going?
 
We talked a lot about Buchanan & the situation of a demagogue appropriating
real issues, somebody said he's making the same mistake, showing the
same limits, as populists before him, being divisive, attacking non-white-
males & the labor movement & immigrants.  How he talks big but is
unbelievable even if his ideas were acceptable.  Somebody said what if the
same things were said by a Jerry Brown none of Buchanan's supporters would
listen because the code words would be left out.  I thought if the issue
is the impoverishment of working people in this society in terms of
education, employment, housing & job security - if this is the issue
that crosses ethnic & racial lines, and if politicians are talking about
complicity of gov't & big business in making that happen - then where
is the manifesto that would declare the artist's right to speak as artist
to the direction of political decisions - that would lay down the moral
spiritual basis for compassionate kind common good society - that would
provide some nuts & bolts ideas for legislation that would push for more
economic equity?  How bout we come up with a collective set of statements
all aimed in that direction - not a hammered-together set piece but a
collection of statements?  If people want to write such things & put them
under a SPECIFIC subject heading I will at least print them off & collect
them together.  What we do with them after that - any ideas?
      If someone more versed in computers has a way to store &
transmit such things & wants to help, please speak up.
How about a big book with a page or two for each contributor,
a photo & bio, & an imagined future? Perhaps with writings under
specific issue headings.  Brief, well-put together statements.
 
I also worry that this may be a total waste of all our time & energy.Comments?
Do we need a website & a cheapo book called HOW MANY REPUBLICANS?
p.s. I went to school with Al Franken.  I wrote plays he acted in
(including a very prophetic one about a film guy who goes to a
small town to film "the real America" & throws everybody in a tizzy.
He & Tom Davis actually went to a small MN town & tried to DO that
in a perverse way - got tossed out for obscenity & defaming the
town's reputation).  Maybe we could enlist Al in this campaign!!

Subject:      dead classes, living classes, theory?
 
Ron S., Chris S., Rod and others, etc:
 
        I think there's a lot of meeting ground between the various
positions about class, poetics theories, etc. that have been on the list
since Monday. Ron's right to call me out about a bit of rhetorical
overkill (nobody's noticed that's my weakness, I supppose?) on the
subject of who gets discussed and why, although to some extent I must
have missed the discussion about Steve Evans ideas (I actually only
signed on the list about that time), although I remember
him posting. I think, as Rod would probably grant, that the relation of
the various "class" changes in terms of who's doing what kinds of poetry,
etc, result very directly from the social changes that he also mentions.
I mean, I don't think it's accidental that people who might end up being
interested in experimental poetry aren't going to go to Harvard
anymore--the people who did, like Charles Bernstein etc., ran and got
chased out of there (both) so fast that it's a a phenomena unlikely to
take place again, since probably even those very few young poetics
students who MIGHT have a chance to go to Harvard know that if they do,
they won't be able to study anything they love. But Chris is right:
"rejecting" academia isn't the relevant question for people who are on
the verge of being denied access to it anyway.
 
Still, Chris,
while I understand the need for the kind of group bonding you're
suggesting, I'm not sure we need to sacrifice critique (even the white
hot variety) for that kind of bonding--I respect the Apex editors (o god
please NO ONE EVER SAY M POETS AGAIN) without agreeing with them, but I'm
even friendly with several of them and you can be damn sure that
when it comes to most political, academic, and poetic issues that I'm
right beside them--the very fact that we both read "experimental
poetries" means that in most social environments in which I move, we'd be
social allies. But I do reserve the right to disagree with them--as they
have reserved the right to disagree with me--although it's clear that
such disagreement is not the issue in, say, an environment like
Washington, D.C.--around here we'd all of us--apex, language poets, you
and me, etc--be considered pinkos.
 
        But although I also greatly respect Henry Gould's moving forward
towards trying to take some political activity with the group of artists
he's working with, his position vis a vis the political implications of
form frustrate me. On the abstract level he's perhaps right--there's no
transcendent, inherent, or "natural" implications of any artistic form,
and I COULD be writing villanelles AND be both a poetic and political
revolutionary. But Henry's comments simply seem to ignore the ACTUAL
political situation of writing, which is quite simply that both academic
and poetic production networks operate according to an almost unviolable
politics of form, which is to say that people in various literary
programs are completely denied access to even the questions Henry himself
wants to raise. Try going to most MFA programs in this country and
presenting something with ANY level of syntactic oddity and see how far
you get. Try GETTING HIRED at a university for teaching formally
innovative poetry--there have been about 50-100 full-time poetry creative
writing
positions advertised in the MLA the last two years, and poets who work
with innovative form on any level have been given EXACTLY TWO of those
jobs. Not political? And Henry's idea that maybe experimental poetries have
been sullied by any contact with funding or academic life seems the worst
kind of misplaced romanticism--as if our integrity as poets depends on
being despised, impoverished, ignored, or having trust funds so we don't
have to be. No way.

You want political poetry, how about Neruda's CANTO GENERAL?
 
There is a populist/historicist voice, plenty of tradition behind it in
America and elsewhere. Rexroth somehow managed to use it for more
meditative and philosophical ends, but
 
however you slice it, it is a very different sense of language from
that undertaken by poets designated by any letter of the alphabet.

    I say poets will find an audience when they have something worthwhile
to say (and even when they don't, as witness some of my endless yapping
on this poor network).  I live in Providence, which is a special case.
Ed Honig is here, poet who started a lot of the Creative Writing Movement
back in 60s.  Before that time there was no such thing as a "poetic production
network" (except the old old boy network).  Now it's an industry.  The
Brown cottage version is BONAFIDE 3rd GENERATION CARD-CARRYING AVANT-GARDE
LINGO-LANGO PONGO-PANGO EXPERIMENTALIST, and you better skew your syntax
if you want an audience here.  All with little cute MFA's glowing over
their resumes.
 
Mark writes: "Henry's idea that maybe experimental poetries have been

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
whew, henry, henry, henry . . . .
 
been to brown--they really ain't into pingo-pango, language
poetry, nor even Experimentalism, per se.
 
been to language poetry--it isn't really "Experimental" {that is
to say--it does not use scientific principles of Experiment--&
therefore differs from the work of Concrete Poets, or John
Cage, Italian Futurists, Jackson Mac Low, & etc. which do..}
 
been to language poetry--it really isn't in any "Avant Guarde"
tradition that I know of--certainly there are some A-V G-D
writers whom the CFAP wants to canonize {& ironically be
thus ordained by these canonized "ordinals"} but the
"programme" is not technically A-V G-D, precisely
BECAUSE of its focus on "the canonization." As i
understand it, the A-V G-D focuses on the caNNon!!
 
finally, Henry--you want political poetry, (and ironically?)
disjointed syntax, & institutional immobility, may i recomend
to you a writer named Wm. Shakespeare, his ripostes
attacking the physically handi-capped (Richard 3), blacks
(Othello), Native Americans (Tempest), women, (everything),
Hebrews, (do i have to name these?)  use the "Ultimate irony
& double-talk." to show that the powerful white men in charge
are there because they aught to be.
 
Uncle Joe WAS a monster, we all know that, but so were
John D. Rockefeller & Henry Ford. Pick on someone bigger
than you. That's the real challenge.

Dear T-Door,
well, touche, Tony for putting Stalin in his place  - far as I know
Mandelstam didn't get much flak from either Rockefeller or Ford
but I'm sure he would have answered them in stikii if they tried.
 
And clearly the Brown program has helped you zoom beyond any
map I have of the cutting edge of experimental principles!
I've read this guy Shakespeare, though - my theory is the plays were
actually written by a horse - see the cryptic ironic
double-talk remark at close of Richard III - and that's how
I feel, too!  - "Smokin Joe" Henry

Not sure where it came from, and it may indeed actually be Ronald Duncan,
but I know in later poems Duncan in a sense embraces cancer and boils and
all the other breakdowns of the body (and body politic) as necessary, that
what he perhaps earlier calls "multiversity" (as opposed to "university") in
all its messiness is precisely what is needed, valued. So I wouldn't
necessarily think a quote like this from Duncan is something in total
agreement with "certain of Pound's more rabid views." The late poem by
Duncan perhaps most central to this discussion is "In Blood's Domaine," from
the Passages sequence. The poem appears in Ground Work II: In The Dark, and
also in Selected Poems. But it touches on cancers, bacteria, scarlet
eruptions and disease in general, and it refers directly to Pound ("But what
ate at Pound's immortal Mind?"). I will not quote this poem here because of
the disaster that various email margins and protocol would do to Duncan's
spacing and long lines. I also recommend that if possible one read the poem
in Ground Work, which allows for the lines to stretch out considerably,
whereas the "standard" book size of Selected Poems makes the continuity of
the poem suffer considerable difficulties.

Good news from the booksellers' front!
 
The NLRB hearing went well this morning, and was well attended by nine
Borders workers in wobbly regalia, and other Wobblies in wobbly regalia,
too.  The bargaining unit has been enlarged to include a few workers more
than were originally asked for, so that the unit is up to 45 workers.  The
stipulated election agreement was reached without going into a formal
hearing, and we were happy about that.  Fellow Worker & GST Fred Chase was
a welcome supporter and advisor at the hearing, and was well received by
all.  Another striking feature of this morning's events was the excellent
legal representation of our wonderful union-souled attorney, Regina
Hertzig.
 
 If there is a Borders Books & Music near you, have a cup of
coffee there some time and mention these facts to the workers, if you get
the chance.  Don't be shy in any other kind of bookstore, either.
 
 The Philly IWW phone # is: (215) 724-1424, Mailbox#1.
 
 Watch for upcoming posts that will be coming directly from the
booksellers' organizing committee...
 
Thanks again to all of you who have been sending in messages of support!

Ummm... is this a surprise?  When you say "physically alters," what do

i wish there were a way to address what strikes me as a certain (white?)
male-ness in this conversation... i don't mean to be at all provocative
here---women poets have been mentioned, certainly... but my-this post
included, it's become a matter of men discussing various poetic
histories... it's just that i wonder to what extent this question of
bonding/privilege/class is intermingled with gender issues... and methinks
it would be apropos to hear from women on this list, whether they're
finding themselves resisting the discussion as it's currently taking
shape...

ies of 1961" as exemplary of Whalen's use of nouns & then
claim "an absolute opacity to the nominal" in his poetry seems a tad
perverse.  You can find opacity in his work, but only in a small part of his
practice, even in his extensive use of lists.  One of the lovely things about
that work is the way he often foregrounds the strangeness of language &
speech, and plays with the tension between opacity & transparency.
 
With Oppen's poetics of interrogation, examining the interplay of
world/word/self/community, I DO read him as a spiritual poet, though perhaps
that is my own perversity.  I'm not sure he would have appreciated the
characterization.  His work struggles for an unattainable clarity,
acknowledges the failure, & insists on continuing to speak (cf. the end of
"Neighbors" in _Primitive_).  It's the search, opposed to the posturing found
in some others, that is meaningful to me here.
 
Not a big surprise, I guess, to hear that you don't respect Sobin's work.
 There are many ways to work musicality into a poem, & Sobin's careful
attention to sound structures hardly evinces a "tin ear." Rather a successful
voiced entanglement of world & word.
 
Emerson, in the essay Ed Foster mentioned the other day ("Experience")
writes: "But the definition of _Spiritual_ should be, _that which is its own
evidence_."
 
Doesn't Ken Irby's work belong in this discuusion?
_________________________________________________
 
 
Charles Smith,
 
 
"Ron, could you talk more about how you see Whalen using the noun?  I
think Snyder may sometimes approach this when he's not caught up in
making a "point," something he'd characterize as "spiritual
materialism."  What about the noun in Oppen?    Another poet I'd look
at here is Sobin who so often brings across a sense of the numinous
through his nouns, despite his assertions that his work has been a
sruggle to get away from their static quality.
 
I'd also be inclined to add Larry Eigner to your list above..." (your
ellipsis)
 
---
 
I'd thought of Larry as I wrote my original comments, actually. And
Oppen I can see, though I'd never characterize him as a spiritual poet.
However, I do seem to be allergic to Sobin, who strikes me as precious
and pompous and tries for musicality with a very tin ear.
 
Turning to Whalen (a chance to see if, having moved this past week, my
books are in enough order yet to find something), I get lost, as always
I do, in On Bear's Head. A lot of his work doesn't translate easily to
email (or even HTML), but here's an example of what I was getting at:
 
MYSTERIES OF 1961
 
Lazy tongs
Jacobs ladder
magnetized flywheel
gyroscope
folding mesh ring basket
 
    *
 
Mr KNIBX, a sinister
 
    *
 
"_A_ is for jelly,
 _B_ is for Jell-O"
 
    *
 
"You are the how
 they call panic"
 
-------------------------------
 
This is a text just crying for New Critical exposition, no? Tho, as
somebody noted awhile back, it's got that "not about anything, it just
is" quality all over.  Actually, I read it as a list, moving outward
from tiny phrases to the last two sections which I think function as
equivalents to those early short lines with greater weight. There is,
in Whalen's work, an absolute opacity to the nominal that is both
insisted on (KNIBX) and permitted, rather than imposed (contrast here
with the heroic backlighting of a Sobin or, in some places, Snyder)
 
The poem shifts between emotional states (as do so many of Whalen's,
and so often in just this direction) from "lazy" to "panic." The next
to last section is an index of the slightest shifts (from jelly to
Jell-O in antialphabetical order) as ontologically absolute. What
exactly IS that object that appears to be described in the first stanza
and why is Mr KNIBX sinister? What I note, thinking of Whalen as a
spiritual poet, is how integral the word "lazy" is to "tongs" and how
"how" as a noun has the same character (no going after the precious,
but picking up an accent that is noted but not named).

To follow up on a question I asked the list last week:
 
I've recently discovered that the Williams quote on pg 65 of the David Revill
biography of Cage was actually written about George Antheil in 1927. Not
about Cage in 1939 as the book indicates. The actual Williams quote appears
on pg 61 of the _Selected Essays_. Antheil's name, which appears twice in the
Williams paragraph, was somewhere along the lines excised from the paragraph
as it appears in the Cage bio.

Not surprising -- from what's been said about Revill's book on the
Cage list, I'd take any supposed fact from it with a grain of salt
about the size of Lot's wife.

I'm curious too!  Hang on a day or so, I'm going to scan the
memberships of the listservs I'm on by eye-hand-pen (since
computers are ill-equipped for determining gender based on the
subtleties of naming), in a purely unscientific manner (hell, I
don't even have a theory), and see if I can figure out some

    Okay, some will bored by this
    (and I am curious whether Emily Lloyd, ShuanAnne T. and others may
     see this as male chestbeating)
     but re MW's latest post...
     No, I am not suggesting that we give up critique (even of the redhot
     variety) either, but that includes SELF-critique, no?
     Also, I'd rather see critique or engagement with poems than with
     "positions"  which may have little to do with the poems....
     As for "rejecting" the academy, I've been listening to THE CLASH
     alot lately, and despite their maleism there is an attitude there
     that seems to be almost universally dismissed in avant-garde
     "radical"
 poetry (or theory academic) discussions as of late....
      the idea of a POPULAR BASE for their work which they play against
     CBS/COLUMBIA (now SONY). Perhaps the closest to this was Bukowski
     in recent poetry years....
     I am not suggesting poets should expect large audiences,
     but only pointing out that perhaps biting the academic hand
     that "feeds" (and other institutions---the "heirarchies" and
     althusserian hailing that still informs the various poetry subcultures
     despite the rebellions of previous generations) or would try to
     convince that it "feeds" seems a terrible taboo.....
     Perhaps we demand more sophistication than to find in a new ROOF book
     (or PENQUIN for that matter) an attack on the specific press similar to
      "they said we'd be artistically free/ when we signed that bit of paper/
       they meant (make a little royalty) and worry about it later"
     and besides we're not in it for the money (as it were)
     (or a UNIVERSITY PRESS book)....
     but the equivalent of that is perhaps avant-guard language or
     theory legitimation and feeling hemmed in by habits
     when something you thought you did for intrinsic reasons is revealed
     to be, yet again, done for extrinsic reasons---
     perhaps I am too restless, in a "self-defeating way" here,
     but it does seem that much of the sophisticated talk about
     how we can't do this, or do that, about "false consciousness"
     and the censors that can so easily be internalized onto any
     moment of true feeling that may seem like vulgar marxism or

i have a few questions and comments, mostly naive. so it goes.
 
first, what constitutes an academic poet? most of the discussions on this
list seem to have centered around generations, acronyms for movements,
etc., all of which i would characterize as a concern for the academic.
what is the relationship between poetry and professionalism in this re-
gard? i can understand griot poetics well enough on one hand, chatterton
on the other; it's the in-between that leaves me confused.
 
second, why is the poetics group concerned only with current writing, as
if the defining were an occurrence back through say pound, when where is
lucan, chatterton, skelton, sturluson, etc. in these discussions? as if
there were none, or useless yes yes but for shelley?
 
i fear professionals, organizations, groups, acronyms, movements, totali-
ties, manifestos, definitions, defining anthologies, constructs, names,
academics, and not leaving me breathing space.
 
third, two questions - can anyone write me about bernadette mayer's
health since her stroke? and does anyone have dick higgins' email address?
 
finally, my own writing, which goes out to the lists i co-moderate (among
other places) is easy to obtain at the url below, having little idea of
its place would be among the posts here as poetics has currently developed

Yes, but George is a great example. He came from significant money, as
they say, and after his decade in Mexico (to which he fled after the
Rosenberg arrests) what eased the way back for him was that his sister
June Oppen Degnan had by then become one of the major fundraisers for
the Democratic Party.

When the Allen anthology came out there really was only one cohesive
tradition recognized in print in the US. The objectivists had been
erased almost entirely from the map. Pound and WCW were treated as odd
cases (and Lowell was claiming Pound for his tradition, tho throwing
most of the Cantos out with the wash). Stein was a media joke. So the
visible presence of a new thing had a major decentralizing effect.
 
Tho it wasn't just (or even so much) the Allen anthology that first did
it as it was the bust of Howl and the court trial that followed, the
best seller status of On the Road and the media interest in beatniks
that made it possible for much of that material to get out. Duncan and
Spicer had very ambivalent feelings (or worse) about the attention that
went to these east coast kids being associated with North Beach.
(Somewhere there's a comment, I don't recall from whom, that if Duncan
had not been in Majorca in 1956, the beats never would have happened.
Which obviously's not true, but suggests the depth of feeling.)
 
 
The radicalism of the L poets had relatively little to do with what was
going on in the classrooms on the late 1960s, early 70s, but very much
what was going on in the streets during those years, and in the
villages and paddies of southeast Asia. As somebody who got his draft
notice in 1965 and spent the next 7 years explaining why I was (1) not
going and (2) not exactly willing to go to federal prison, the idea
that French theory was a driver of such activity seems mind boggling.
If you were young and male in the 1960s, your government wanted you to
kill people and was willing to kill you in the process. Nothing very
intellectual about that.

"I know in later poems Duncan in a sense embraces cancer and boils and
all the other breakdowns of the body (and body politic) as necessary,
that what he perhaps earlier calls "multiversity" (as opposed to
"university") in all its messiness is precisely what is needed,
valued."
 
Multiversity was Clark Kerr's term for the "new" university of the
1950s, which he saw (positively) as directed by the needs of
international capital. What it really stood for was the arrival of the
business school as a major function for the first time. Kerr was the
president of the University of California at the time of the Free
Speech Movement, tho not the head of the Berkeley campus. Duncan is
connecting the FSM arrests (described in detail in the poem) with first
increases in the killing in Vietnam (the FSM preceded the first Vietnam
Day rally by almost a year). RD, who always took his alumni status at
Berkeley pretty seriously, was utterly opposed to the idea of the
multiversity (refers to Kerr as "the worm's     mouthpiece"), which is
radically different than his concept, say, of multistability, the
decentralized location of meaning in a painting by, say, Dali, which is
something he sought in his own poetry and found in Jess' collage work.

Subject:      dead theories, live action figures
 
Seems like the poetry that would be important or alive would take the
academy into account as just one more phenomenon in a social matrix,
and would drive toward the center of that matrix using language to
break through static or stylized or hypocritical responses, or
simplistic responses, to human experience; but it also seems true
that poetry is a reality-in-itself, take for example Hart Crane
who I would say used ironic and parodic modes of writing not simply
to reflect reality but to enact some kind of new ecstatic existence
(his "new Word never actually able to be enunciated"). Here we get
into the issue of the "transcendent" as an "immanence" in
"normal" reality.  The "new".  This also relates to the question of
aesthetics - & I think many poets from Bishop to Williams to Crane
(just to stick to this century) would say that the successful poem -
whatever the current socio-political situation - stands on its own,
gets up and walks around as a semi-independent entity.  So the
relevant or exciting poem somehow spans this distance between
independent entity and very immediate political praxis.  And
there we have the unaccountable, the unpredictable, the X
factor, the fatal gift.  Which is fundamentallly responsiveness
to language in action, manifesting itself. - Henry Gould

Grab bag.
 
...Which came first, the poet or the alma mater?  I've been missing
something in this harvard etc. discussion.  If we're talking about
(economic) class, what's the difference between harvard & princeton (what's
the difference between them anyway?  I thought the only reason to go to
either was to make your parents proud)?  While I do think it can
(OCCASIONALLY) be an interesting exercise to compare/group poets born of
same class, gender, race, orientation, mother, etc., it seems kind
of---materialistic? fetishistic? dopey?---to do this by college.  And the
colleges that keep popping up seem to me...telling, in some way.  No mention
of the Bowling Green State poets.  Or any other un-"canonized" college.
(Berkeley having its own kind of sainted symbolism).
 
...C. Stroffolino: seems to me I've not--yet--made any "yer beating yer ole'
boy chest" comments to *anyone* on POETIX (unless the above counts).  So
when you write: "I wonder if Emily Lloyd, Shaunanne T, etc. will find this
male chest beating?"--is it by virtue (or vice) of my being an XX (but not
an M or L) that I'm mentioned? Couldn't Henry or Douglas or
_Your-Fave-XY-Here_ find it tarzan just as easily?  For the record, that was
the sentence I objected to.  Much as I like seeing my name in print.

sure, it probably is dopey to compare poets on the basis of what college
they went to. it is sort of like saying, well, that one's from alabama
and this one from mississippi, what's the difference.  the distinctions
fuzz up the further away you are.  nonetheless, it seems interesting to
me that at the same time harvard students included poets ashbery, o'hara,
creeley, donald hall, robert bly, the yale university english department
was producing a steady stream of future cia types.  james angleton,
one-time editor of furioso and crazed mole-hunter, being only the most
famous.  the institutions' sensibilities have to affected these outcomes.

i'd add to emily's observation that what's at stake in NOT being hired as a
poet in academe (or as a creative writer in general) generally has to do
with one's ability to theorize one's work---and by work i mean both writing
and teaching... that is, the relationship is inversely proportional:  the
more one theorizes, the more "radical" one is perceived, the less likely
the offer...
 
and by "theory" i don't mean just academic theory, continental theory,
etc... i mean self-reflection, awareness of what one is about as a writer
and teacher, etc...
 
as i see it, and based on this (and other years') mla job lists (an
academic litmus, yes) the prevailing currents underwriting "creative
writing" positions in academe have to do with an anti-theory
constituency... it may *seem* to have shifted when one spends daily hours
on this list... but when it comes down to hiring committees and the like,
i've found creative writers in general---the ones who have a say in most of
the lit. programs around the nation---to be as exclusively anti-theory as
i've found the lit. and lit. theory types to be anti-poetic, or
anti-literary (read "unwilling to consider a different set of writing
imperatives")... and it's been this stance on the part of creative writers
that has kept out of academe many of us who find theoretical insight
indispensable to our writing and, again, teaching...

In-Reply-To:  <199602291042.CAA08964@ix2.ix.netcom.com>
 
        I would like to thank Ron Silliman for the sense of
the history that he consistently brings to the discussions on
this list.  Given the massive cultural amnesia, the 60's and
70's have grown very dim and the 50's have been reduced to a
kind of cartoon. (I am conscious that in the 50's this forty
year span of the recent past would have been considered not
history at all but current).  Last night, in my seminar on
Poetics, the _Ketjak_ period of Ron's work came up, and I
found myself trying to put it in perspective in much the same
way I would have had it been written in the 19th century.
 
        There was some massive trauma in the 70's that has
not been adequately accounted for.  In one sense, it cuts
us off the poetry of the Allen anthology, not totally but in
ways that make reading it impossible without an insistent
awareness of the historical distance.
 
        The dramatic use of monetary policy accounts for
part of it.  I hate to sound like Pound and the credit
cranks, but there seems no doubt that the Federal Reserve
managed in the 70's to take control of the economy in ways
that Pound's contemporaries had theorized but didn't have
the data management systems to implement.
 
        At any rate, it's hard to trace directly from
something as vague as that to what happened in the mid-70's.
 
        The continental theoretical sources to which the
Language poets turned were not at that time academic
currency.  I taught a course about 1975 which I organized
around Foucault's _The Order of Things_, and
such readings in an English department were unheard of.
(Of course, by the end of 70's it was commonplace).
 
        To pick up on Emily Lloyd's question: the odd
situation in the 50's and 60's as far as poetry was concerned
was that the "academic" poets were typically anti-intellectual.
The poets of the Allen anthology were the theorists and
intellectuals, and there is really nothing very surprising
about this.  Traditionally, literary studies had to do
with matters of taste; the ideas--to the extent they were
of concern--were given.  And literary study is still
deeply confused about ideas.  The reason so much
academic theorizing is emtpy is that academics
developed a _taste_ for theory. To say nothing of the fact
that for many of them it is a time saving device: if you
develop a taste for, say, Foucault, you do not have to
read all of those god-awful dusty books that he read.
 
The great danger of the academification of poetry is that
literary study still conceives of itself as purveying a
certain set of tastes.  That is specifically ("there
is no accounting for taste"), it is devoted to putting
its texts out of account.  I suspect that many of the
teachers out there feel they have had some kind of
success when their student's leave their classes "liking"
Foucault or the poetry of Ron Silliman or whatever.
This is what it means to have an academic tradition. It
is not a question of whether some one gets their
bread by working in a university or driving a taxi.
An academic tradition of art is very like an academic
tradition of athletics, it has fans, cheerleaders, and
so forth.  Some times on this list, I hear people cheering
for this or that poet or group of poets.  It's a harmless
pass time, I suppose, but it is just, when it comes to that,
a pass time.

Busted. I don't really have any names for you.  There's just been a lot of
(I think justified) list talk about a general lack of appreciation for
experimental (of any letter) poets & poetry in the academe (and the library
of congress, and the money magazines, and).  And I freely admit that, aside
from a positive gut reaction to Stein, before I was "taught" experimental
poetry (concepts/theories/poems themselves), I tended to be like whoever's
father that was from an earlier post: Why dontcha write pomes ah can
understand?  (As one teacher put it, "You just haven't been invited to the
party yet").  I still have to read Ron's posts (like the one on Whalen's
'61) & others' slowly in order to see the relation between what's being said
& the thing it's being said about--and I'm not, technically, stupid.  So I'm
asking: what's wrong with this picture?
 
A=need academic background (me, and I suspect most others) TO B=understand
exp.-lang poetry.
(Whereas I don't think you need it to understand Rita Dove.  Or Allen Ginsberg).
 
But the A-folks apparently don't appreciate the B-folks.
And the B-folks are angry at the A-folks, w/o whom even less
folks would "be able to see the value" in their work.
 
It is less, I suppose, a question than an observation.  But it does seem
like a weird (anti)relationship.  Symbiosis with a grudge.

Though I'm not in the creative writing job market myself, I can empathize
with the position that a poet's ability to offer some theoretical or at
least self-conscious commentary on his or her own work can have a
detrimental effect.  I think it's natural to grapple with one's creative
demons/angels, to wonder about these strange words we've just aligned on a
page and to speculate on how they got there in the forms they've assumed.
When I've articulated this, however -- even if it's just a preferatory
remark at a reading --  I've occasionally been met with a thinly-disguised
disdain, as if my thinking about what I've done has compromised the
spontaneity or "purity" of the work itself, that by revealing a sense of
form or strategy -- though that sense is often derived in reflection
_after_ the fact of the poem -- I've revealed myself to be a kind of
tradesman, a ghostwriter, a hack.  It's as if poets are supposed to be
idiot-savants, intuitively spewing profundities without the annoying
complications of thought or motive or plain old curiosity.  What I've
occasionally encountered is an archaic view, to be sure, but it's one some
poets themselves depend on for protection, and one that critics -- in a
co-dependent relationship -- continue to foster since it confers a kind of
hermeneutic authority the poet is all too ready to relinquish.

Emily,
 
I like the party metaphor. I got to the party once and thought no one wanted to
talk to me, which I found frustrating. But let's stop: I loath metaphors.
 
I wasn't "taught" experimental poetry as much as I was exposed to it.  If there
was teaching going on it went right by me as I struggled to find a narrative or
similar, familiar device in poetry that was completely new to me.  I was
completely baffled when I first read Oppen.  Dozens of readings later, few
other oeuvres speak to me with such clarity as his (which is all he ever sought
from poetry: a limited, limiting clarity).  Which is a rarity when there is so
much experimental poetry to confront (or, read- whatever).  I say experimental
because I can't find a comfortable definition of "language poetry" and suspect
that it's as applicable a term to writers who are stuck under it, as the
"objectivists" were stuck in their day with a label convenient to some, but
ultimately misused and misunderstood.
 
So before I get totally sidetracked: I don't think anyone needs a hefty
academic background to understand experimental poetry (although I want to pose
this question: can experimental poetry fail?). I find it better not to want a
poem that's easily understood- a paragraph with line breaks in many cases.  It
took me many readings to appreciate Howe, DuPlessis, MacLow, and a long list of
others, but once that connection is made, I have trouble believing they were
"difficult" in the first place.  And the richness and worthwhile-ness of the
work is more apparent with subsequent readings.

        I have never checked the archives, but it seems to be
almost certain, as Charles Alexander, notes that Tytell mistook
Robert Duncan for Ronald Duncan.  To say, the least there is nothing
in Duncan's work during the period that he was corresponding with
Pound that would be consistent with such a comment.
 
        In the 40's and 50's, Duncan was an anarchist, and was connected
with people around the anarchist magazine, Win, during the years he was in
the East. I know of no reason to believe that his assessment of the
political situation would have been different when he was corresponding
with Pound than it was when he wrote "Passages 13":
 
             Satan looks forth from
men's faces:
 
            Eisenhower's idiot grin, Nixon's
            black jaw, the sly glare of Goldwater's eye, or
            the lok of Stevenson lying in the U.N. that our
            Nation save face   .
 
His face multiplies from the time Roosevelt, Stalin,
    Churchill, Hitler, Mussolini; from the dream
    of Oppenheimer, Fermi, Teller, Vannevar Bush...
 
        In the essay on Whitman he writes:
 
"Our field in which we see the form of the poem happening belongs
ultimately to, is an immediate apprehension of our sense of locality in
'the infinite variety, the past, the surroundings of to-day, or
what may happen in the furture,' the grand ensemble Whitman evokes."
 
"In the late nine-thirties, as I came into some kind of social
consciousness, ideads of Whitman's had come also  to be the ideas of
established and increasingly coercive governments. Totalism--ensemblism--
is  haunted when we return to it today in the dark monstrosities of
socialistic and democratic totalitarianism."
 
        The non-coercive ensemble is an anarchist ideal--or problematic
form--that Duncan attempts to achieve throughout his work.
 
        It is necessary to beware of academic specialists who devote
themselves to this or that figure in ignorance of field their work
properly and responsbility belongs to.

emily: i don't necessarily agree that one needs an academic background to
read L poets and not Dove or ginsberg, or at least, that this has to do
perhaps more with the social saturation of certain norms of what "poetry" is
that makes folks think it's easier to understand one form of poetry than
another.  a contemp. young person would probably need an academic exposure to
"understand" shakespeare's sonnets, but not to understand that it is meant to
be taken as "serious poetry."  it's amazing to me how fast students with a
traditionalist poetry background (i.e. a "semi-educated"  one) get excited
about experimental stuff once it's demystified for them, which doesn't take
long, and usually can be done in group play-type activities,like
guess-the-puns-in-this-stein-piece or read this funny hannah weiner play

        I should have identified Ronald Duncan, a poet and playwright who
edited  _The Townsmen_.  He was a part of the Pound network in way that
Robert Duncan never was, and he seems to have been committed more or less
to EP's agenda.  There are a number of letters from EP to him in the
_Selected Letters_.

First, I don't think that's necessarily true. I didn't find good
Stein+Zukofsky-sprung poetry through school, and don't know anyone who did.
If anything, I think _autodidacts_ are more likely to be attracted towards
that goofily difficult bunch of "traditions" (where "tradition" means that
if you read one writer and you like her, you're likely to end up bumping
into this other writer while researching).
 
(One of the reasons Bob Perelman's book _The Trouble with Genius_ shook me
up so badly was that it seemed to point out some serious flaws in this
notion of a cross-temporal utopia of autodidacts.)
 
Second, things do change. My experience matches Donald Byrd's: in the
mid-to-late '70s, "French poststructuralism" wasn't supported by USA
academia. In my college, I could find no philosophy or English professors
who'd ever read Derrida, though some had heard of his name.
 
Maybe what the disagreement boils down to is whether all "intellectuals"
are kept safely in the cages of academia, lining their floors with the _New
York Review of Books_. Academia likes to give that impression;
non-academics tend to bristle at it (unless they're instead the types to
bristle at being accused of intellectualism).

Didn't mean to downplay what is more aptly called the American Invasion of
Indonesia-- which is very much emphasized in my attempt to contextualize
these things in my introduction to the Watten issue of _Aerial_. & Don I
think is exactly right about what got called by the Trilateral Commission
"The Crisis of Democracy." Of course what they meant by this "crisis" is
"there's a threat that the population might actually get involved in running
things." In '71 Nixon & co. radically reorganized the intl monetary system
essentially disavowing the U.S. role as intl banker & setting up institutions
even farther from any possibility of public control (than the US govt). All
of this accelerated the disproportionate distribution of resources (it's now
60 to 1 between industrial countries & the third world, & actually much
greater within individual countries). My source for much of this information
is Chomsky, his sources are things like The Finacial Times & the NYTimes.
 
Beside all this the question of when French theory hit seems small,
but I do recall Carla H. saying to me "we were reading Derrida & Barthes in
'73" -- & I think the vocabulary of l.p. was effected by that. But, & this is
why it was so interesting, l.p. did it on their own terms.
 
I don't really understand the idea that it doesn't matter where someone went
to school-- of course it does, it's a major formative experience. It's not
"necessary" to know it, but it is of interest in understanding the contexts
from which someone is writing.
 
Thinking more about this question of class-- as a generality "class" is all
too accurate-- one, however, does not experience oneself as a generality--
that is precisely the violence of class. In that sense it's not so complex--
it's that, through an easily discernible disproportinate & unjust allocation
of resources one is _defined_. Of course, the individual's struggle with it
_is_ complex, particularly in a society in which there is a certain amount of
class mobility (getting to be less & less mobile), but the fact of it seems
awfully clear. Part of what poetry _is_ is resisting such definition, such
overdetermination. & I think all of  the people I mentioned that went to
Harvard also saw that overdetermination & turned to a form of expression in
which they also cld resist it (I know I know, another problematic
generalization). But I think the fact that they went to Harvard, the job of
which is to establish & maintain elite power, & chose _poetry_ is immensely
to their credit.
 
Finally, re the question Chris raised abt a popular base-- we do have the
example of the slam thing, the Nuyoricans etc. & my experience of that scene
is that their are a number of quite interesting writers there.
Heard a radio interview with Pete Seeger, he was asked to compare his
political activities of the 30s/40s with the 80s/90s-- he said "They used to
have to beat us back, now they just drown us out."
 
Off the global politics of wittle poets topic-- re Oppen-- there seems to me
a fairly large shift in his work after _Of Being Numerous_ -- I love all his
work, but the late books particularly -- he seems, perhaps, to have let go of
a certain kind of sense in favor of another. Reminiscent perhaps of the first
book, but possibly effected by Duncan's ear? An even further opening of the
open text? That kind of fluidity.

Good point about "serious poetry," uh-huh.  Yup, I've been one of those
excited semi-educateds.  But who demystified for me?  It wasn't my mailman
or my mom (but she does love Dove [I should mention: I don't mean to nail

way (I like) of talking about grad school.  But it's still grad school.

Change that "when" to "if" & I'd agree with you.
 
For me, Derrida's "central ideas" _depend on_ his ridiculously complex
styles, and my pleasure in his writing depends to some extent on his
ridiculousness. My fellow (& far superior) non-poet genre-writer Samuel R.
Delany has written about this in his _Silent Interviews_. One sample
paragraph:
 
"Thousands of lies, reams of nonsense, and barrels of bullshit are put out
each day in unadorned, straightforward language. And they're swallowed
right down -- because no one is initially uncomfortable with the 'simple'
rhetoric. People assume sentences such as 'Thousands of lies, reams of
nonsense, and barrels of bullshit are put out each day in unadorned,
straightforward language,' are somehow _less_ rhetorical, and more
transparent to truth, than, say, this sentence which both criticizes the
assumptions about it and quotes it -- when indeed both sentences are
equally rhetorical, only coming from different rhetorical traditions, the
inner one only more familiar than the outer (or marginal) one."

What makes Koethe an academic poet?  That he teaches in a philosophy
department?  Seems to me that definitions of academic poetry are made of
convenience: both John Hollander and Charles Bernstein have been called
academic poets, surely.

Subject:      Emerson & Trans parency
 
I found this in my notes on Emerson.
 
Transparency is manifested by the medium lying between two discontinuous
realms.
 
Transparency is impossible in the absence of either or both (transparent?)
opaque realms. Something always lies beyond the medium. The essence of a
transparent medium is to be between two things. The eye sees "by means of "
and despite. The two realms enclosing the blank space of transparency are
characterized by color and figure which define opacity.
 
That idea gets connected to this:
 
"Through solidest eternal things (man) woman find their road, as if they
did not subsist, and does not once suspect their being .As soon as she
needs a new object, suddenly she beholds it and no longer attempts to pass
through it, but takes another way. When she has exhausted for the time the
nourishment to be drawn from any one person or thing, the object is
withdrawn from her observation and though still in her immediate
neighborhood, she does not suspect its presence."
 
Does death come from refocusing or vice versa. Does the friend withdraw
into death or does our perception or recognition of the use of the friend
push the friend toward death.
 
It is the secret of the world that all things subsist and do not die, but
only retire a little from sight, and afterwards return again.
 
The solid globe of Parmenidean nature is an opaque version of the
transparent eyeball in (Emerson's) "Nature".

I couldn't agree more (nor more with the SRD quote you appended). Back to
politics, and whatever you think/make of Derrida's politics in
particular, I almost always have the feeling that attacks on D. for his
"obscurity" have a politically unpleasant edge.
 
If I wanted to be catty, I'd throw it back to Emily: what exactly *are*
Derrida's "central ideas" -- and note that the best attempt I know to
articulate these, Geoff Bennington's JACQUES DERRIDA, takes a whole book
and includes a (partially) convincing "refutation" by J.D. himself along
the bottom margin. Or cf. Simon Critchley's ETHICS OF DECONSTRUCTION,
which takes on only a small set of issues and yet serves only to convince
the reader of how much more there is to be said (by J.D., by Levinas,
etc.).
 
But I've somehow lost the thread here -- couldn't the same point be made
about Hejinian, Ron S., Oppen, Cage, Stein, Brooks, and on and on --
isn't it a kind of joint commitment of "L" writers and "M" writers and
some (good) ("normal") writers and Derrida that, whatever language *is*,
plainly transparent it isn't? And that some politics, at least, is
implicated in the recognition of that fact? And by the way, isn't this
one of the things that really turns off the academy to L. poets in terms
of hiring? Not the questioning of one's methods, so much as the
questioning of the "literal" base of the transaparent-communication
enterprise?

Try:
 
They meant, they'd make a lot of money
     (actually he may say "lots" for

And worry about it later
 
Other than that, yrs in agreement...

Fred,
Interesting. But I don't think the pejorative assigned to people who
explicate themselves is "hack", and I don't think you have to invent a
jargon of purity for the people who do things differently. I don't doubt
that there are people who would say those things; I prefer to think of them
as thinking about something else. My problem with
explication-as-introduction, footnoting, and other apparatuses (and I have
to say, this is my problem with David Jones) is that they have been used
clumsily as cites for sleight of hand, and other very base illusions (cf.
Waste Land). I don't want poetry to confuse me, I don't want it to depress
me or make me overexcited. I am afraid that so far I have belonged to an
imaginary group of chthulhu writhers who dream only of a poem that enacts
its own writing, and is still somehow amazing--something intelligent and
beautiful--and if it arrive in either the lab coat of experiment or the
buggy of pleasure, will I fail to welcome it? Huh? No. I will fail, though,
if I fall asleep.
 
And I don't think this stance toward explication is unique to the poetic
right wing; Ted Greenwald told me after a reading at St Marks (he read
three of his books in twenty-five minutes or so) that when you read, "no
bullshit" is the rule.
 
All best,
Jordan
 
PS Don't forget to come to Poetry City, your experimental theme park.
Tonight's main attractions, Bill Luoma and Simon Pettet. Bill will be
available to sign his new gorgeous Khlebnikoved-out book _Swoon Rocket_
(The Figures) not to mention the last seven copies of _My Trip to New York
City_, and Simon's _Selected Poems_ and _Talking Pictures_ (with Rudy
Burckhardt) will be on the table too. Poetry City is located at 5 Union
Square West (between 14th & 15th), 7th Floor, NYC. The reading begins at
6:30, and it's free.

As an academic "in" contemporary poetry studies but not in creative
writing programs, apparently doomed for the forseeable future to adjunct
positions outside the tenure track, I thought I'd just throw in a cheer
for Ron's and Joe's and Don Byrd's posts.  And add my own perspective.
 
1) Cheerleading.  You don't have to be slated as a "poet" to be enlisted
in this business; it's enough to be in CONTEMPORARY poetry.  My own work
explores the circulation of cultural value in contemporary poetry from a
perspective owing a lot to Foucault, Bourdieu, and B. H. Smith, in other
words a perspective that looks at cultural fields and their mechanisms of
exclusion/inclusion/definition without a "promotional" end in mind.  Yet I
don't know how many times I've been asked, "So, who does your work
support?  If we buy your account, should we read Ashbery or Amy Clampitt?"
People really get pissed off when I respond, "My theoretical work is about
why and how questions like that keep getting asked; it doesn't answer
them.  Still, stay the hell away from Clampitt."
 
2) Tastemaking.  If as an academic in the poetry biz you don't tell which
contemporary poets to read, you're expected to tell why we should read
poetry at all.  Refusing to do this causes no end of trouble.  I know why
I read poetry, but I know plenty of people who don't read any, and they
don't seem to be deprived.  It's damned presumptuous to write as though
they are, or to suggest that the reasons why poetry is important to ME
will be important to anybody else.
 
3) Theorization as self-interrogation.  Joe Amato has hit the nail
precisely.  Since the academic poetry biz is invested in perpetuating its
own cultural value, to question or even explicitly state why you do what
you do (in writing no less) seems like academic suicide.  For the same
reasons, theory as cultural fashion becomes -- astonishingly -- a mode of
reestablishing the poetic as the ultimate source of value.  So, to pick up
on another recent thread, though Mutlu Blasing's book POLITICS AND FORM IN
POSTMODERN POETRY opens by ridiculing the open form debate as a "heroic
drama of a central agon between the forces of reaction and progress," she
can't help framing her readings (and the poets she reads) as an advance, a
repudiation of the hopelessly naive Pound.
 
That's the current state of my cynicism.
 
Cheers,
David

     Does this mean that poetry can change the way a reader

Sure it can, and i'm a bit surprised by the question, by the tentativeness
of that groping for "scientific" confirmation of what we know to be true.
No question that reading all that poetry makes us different people, changes
the kinds of organisms we are.  But to stick with "science" or "biology,"
the question arises from a persistent reification, common to popular
discourse, of the "biological" as a kind of lumpy given.  In fact, we
evolve in dialectical relation to "environment" from the get-go--that
environment is always interacting with and modifying the genetic script.
If you don't get all the nutrients you need (like the 25% of children in
this country living below the "poverty line") your growth will be
stunted (and, among other things, your brain won't develop the way it
cld/shld).  If you don't get a chance to read at a young age, certain
synaptic pathways just will not be formed.  And as for poetry, they may
not be able to point out the relevant topographies on the brainscan yet,
but there's no doubt in my mind, so to speak, that there must be biological
formations/matrices corresponding to "poetical activity" if one knew
where to look.  I mean, i can feel them pinging away in there when i sit
down to read a little Kit Robinson, can't you?  The american tree is, well,
dendritical...

Maria,
        demystifying experimental stuff: as a toiler in the same
pedagogical fields as yourself, perhaps I'd say much the same to emily.
But 'desmystifying' suggests there's no value to not understanding a
text whereas... well, maybe one difference between the experienced
reader of contemporary poetry (or art, music, etc) and the less
experienced, is that far from resenting or being disconcerted by the
failure to understand they have a positive and growing  appetite for it,
for that which mystifies. What the fuck?!
