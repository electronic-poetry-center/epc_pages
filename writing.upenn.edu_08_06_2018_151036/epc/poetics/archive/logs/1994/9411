Subject:      G-ology
 
First, two corrections, or, as we G1-ers are wont to say,
self-criticisms:
 
Jena's right that I conflated Chain & A Poetics of Criticism. Mea culpa.
Tho she doesn't mention that her co-editor also co-edited the Technique
section of O-blek 12. I would love to have somebody FULLY elucidate the
differences between the various publications with their overlapping
editorships. I frankly could learn a lot from that.
 
Second correction: nobody seems to have caught my error in assigning
authorship of Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana to "Eli Mandel." It
was Eli Siegel (who still turned into a professional homophobe at the
end of his life). WCW wrote the intro to Siegel's book. Anybody out
there read it?
 
Steve Evans' intro to the Technique section of O-blek 12 seems to me the
most heroic attempt to date to articulate a terrain for G2. I think that
he's right in that intro about the motivating "hatred of identity" that
runs through the work, although his reading of the phenomena in O-blek
is more broad and generous than that espoused in Apex's "State of the
Art" manifesto. I used those two pieces with my class at Naropa, which
led to some lively, albeit inconclusive discussions. Certainly nobody
has ever done a more aggressive job misreading and stereotyping a
community than Apex' broad swipes at G1 (& esp. LangPo):"an avant-garde
dominated in its practices by a poetics espousing the priority of
'language itself' over all other relations." (p. 5)
 
Is that not a classic instance of labelling theory taking the misnomer
"L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Poet" just a wee bit literally? I've never once met a
G1 who espoused that.
 
Or, later on the same page, "a participatory valorization of this
disintegration...." Haven't both Gayatri Spivak & Bob Perelman
completely answered that in response to Fred Jameson's
only-slightly-more-in-depth reading of the poem "China"?
 
And, throughout State of the Art, an entire series of presumptions
concerning the social functions of innovation, as though everyone from
M. Bertrand thru G1 were an Italian futurist celebrating the
potentiality of the submachine gun. Talk about "phobic
characterization"!!
 
I think what makes the Apex group stand out so much, especially at a
distance (where, for example, it's easier to forget [or ignore] that
Alan Gilbert, Kristin Prevallet and Lew Daly, the editors whom I've
actually met, are all lovely, charming, intelligent people, as full of
complexity and caution as one might want), is precisely the directness
of their address, which shoots right through even the "post"iness of its
convoluted syntax. While Steve wants me to "say it ain't so,"the Apexers
say openly that "a new understanding of our task as iconoclasts and not
innovators will emerge." If I ignore for a moment how I feel at the lack
of accuracy and generosity in their description of my cohorts in G1,
that's still an interesting and difficult claim to make and I want to
know more. What distinguishes them as a group phenomenon is their
ambition--it's the most "out there" manifesto we've had in ages--even if
their "ambition is to have no ambition" (as I think the British punk
band The Gang of Four once put it, back in the swampy G1 days of 1982).
 
Besides, Steve, Chick Gandil, who organized the Black Sox throw of the
1919 series (he was the first baseman), and thus gave rise to the very
phrase you use, used to live on my very block here in Berkeley. He
worked with my grandfather. That's at least as cosmic as discovering
that I'm the reincarnation of one of Jackson Mac Low's past lives. (Or
that Jack Spicer and my father died on the very same day in 1965.)
 
>But on to specifics. (This is Steve "talking")
  Marjorie Perloff's remarks
>about the shifting tenor of political commitments
>among progressives in the U.S. make sense, but let's
>not forget that the "burning political concerns" of

>*Pcoet* as doing political work, one has to have a
>sense of the political rather more elastic than most
>people on the left had in the 70s or for that matter
>have today.
 
At the point that David wrote Pcoet, he was either about to (or just
had) abandoned his idea of ever finishing his dissertation (the one
chapter he wrote appeared in the Maps special issue on Zukofsky), and
came out of the closet to his students at Berkeley with a vengence,
platform shoes and glitter in his beard. There was absolutely no way
that any one confronting either him or that text in those days could not
see the text's relation not just to the history of modernism but also to
what was then known as "gender fuck" politics.
 
The argument for Bruce's work is not dissimilar. Tho his idea of gender
fuck is a little different.
 
Besides, one of the major thrusts of one strain of G1 was to counter the
various modes of vulgar left critical/aesthetic practice. Bruce Boone,
Bob Gluck, Steve Benson, myself and Kathleen Fraser were all once in the
same marxist study group, and we had some TERRIFIC arguments. In every
sense of that word. And every single one of the G1s who were politically
active (not just through our poetry) dealt with these issues repeatedly.
 
>What I don't understand is why this hard-won utopian
>intelligence (or say: set of reading practices) is
>not brought to bear on the *New Coast.*
 
I disagree that this is what's goin' on. Here the claim in Apex about
"iconoclasts and not innovators" rings much truer to my ear. What I want
to know is what the social content of that might be.
 
 If you can
>read Rae Armantrout as "positioned critique" can't
>you do the same for Robert Kocik?
 
Yes, absolutely. I'm interested in examining the nature of each
position. I'm not especially making the argument for my
g-g-g-generation.
>
>I suppose that at some point, Ron, names will have

Oh, I still do believe in Lenin's idea that the move toward
"abstraction" is toward the truer layer of the concrete.
 
 I'm honestly not sure what's at
>stake for you in such remarks.
 
I thought (still do) that if I prod a little, I'd get some interesting
feedback from poet(s) in G2 (maybe even G3) who would further articulate
the landscape, so that the "prospective" (i.e. inchoate) nature posed by
O-b 12 might give greater rise to a new shared vision of a broader
terrain. Frankly, I'd like to see less reactive criticism and more
manifestos a la Apex (and from a broad range of positions). I find it
interesting (very ambiguous word here, and deliberately so) that the
most detailed response has come from somebody who positions himself as a
critic and not as a poet, as such.
 
>On the question of "average ages" of *NC* and *NAP,* it
>seems clear to me that biological age doesn't equal "age"
>in terms of the poetic field.
 
Huh?
Actually, the question of age is a complex one all on its own. One of
the real values of The Art of Practice is its inclusion of a number of
poets generationally part of G1 who did not begin publishing until later
than most of those in Tree. (I'm reminded, say, how late both Jackson
Mac Low and Hannah Weiner were to publish regularly. When Jackson was my
age, 48, he had exactly 6 books in print.)
 
But I do think that there's a generational dynamic (different for each
G) that focuses when poets are under still well under 35, and that to
wait longer as a generation to begin to stake out a space is itself a
notable step, so that the hesitancy implicit there must itself be looked
at as part of the process (Think of Olson's age in comparison to
Creeley, Blackburn et al, or of Burroughs to Ginsberg & Kerouac, or of
Williams to the Objectivists.)

>To clarify one general point in closing: I am not under

>poetry is and does has as yet been articulated by G2
 
Yep, except for Pam, Lew, Kristin & Alan have at least made one stab.
 
 Given the
>way literary fields work in capitalist social formations,
>the failure to achieve such a collective redefinition
>will lead to a lot of interesting poetry disappearing
 
Absolutely! Several G1ers have noted in recent years how much the O-b 12
formation of G2 reminds them of the younger writers who found themselves
active around certain modes of the NAP in the mid- to late-60s. David
Schaff, Bill Deemer, Harold Dull, d alexander, Lowell Levant, Ed Van
Aelstyn, John Gorham, Gail Dusenbery, Stan Persky, Seymour Faust, George
Stanley, William Anderson, Wilbur Wood, etc etc etc. But failing to
distinguish their terms from NAP1, NAP2 proved unable, unwilling to set
up the institutions that might have insured their own communities'
perpetuation into the future.
 
I am amazed and appalled that neither the Messerli nor the Hoover
anthologies include the work of Lew Welch. In the 1960s, he would have
come into almost any listing of the 24 or so most influential NAPpers.
Such is history. You have to write it yourself.

In-Reply-To:  <199411010036.TAA18462@gwis2.circ.gwu.edu>
 
Some items to consider in the current "generation" debate (and let me say
that the remarks I'm about to make are not directed at any one particular
respondent.
 
1)      It is a standard hegemonic (not to mention racist and imperialist)
move to take one piece of writing by some particular "group" (as it is
defined from outside) as the example of what is wrong with that "group"
as a whole, and then dismissing that "group" on the basis of that one
piece of writing. It is even hegemonic, racist, and imperialist to refer
to them as a "group." What does all this have to do with many of the
reactions to the introductory essay in Apex of the M?
 
2)      "Make it new" was hardly a dictum put forth by someone interested
in social liberation. Indeed, "make it new" is at least as effective as a
capitalist slogan as it is as a call to radical change. And whatever the
social effectiveness of the proponents of "make it new" in poetry (I
think it's unclear, but worth discussing) their success has been
undeniable in terms of their marketing of that concept and their
promotion of poetry that fits the concept.
 
3)      Indeed, it seems true to me that all writers have a complex
relation to past and present, making what is "new" by borrowing,
changing, demolishing the past.
 
4)      To see the "lyric" as somehow a force of social conservatism is
simply HISTORICALLY UNVERIFIABLE. The lyric form, like the use of
parataxis, collage, sonnets, whatever, is a possibility that can be made
use of, or discarded, in a variety of historical situations.
 
5)      I don't think it's at all clear whether younger writers are
"returning to the lyric." But if writers are using lyric forms, the
question to ask is NOT "what's wrong with those writers?" but rather
"what is it about the contemporary social environment that makes the
lyric seem useful to some writers" or "what is it about the lyric that
makes it seem useful to some writers in this social environment."
 
6)      One of the things I'm struck by in my conversations with writers
of my own age is their GENEROSITY in responding to the work of previous
generations of writers. I'm beginning to wonder whether more established
writers can respond with the same level of generosity. What does it mean
that it would be taken as a sign of WEAKNESS to actually believe that
writers in the past did some interesting things?
 
7)      In fact, my objection to Lew Daly's introduction to Apex of the M
is not primarily on the level of poetics (though I find the statement of
poetics there fundamentally misguided) but that it repeats the same
Oedipal MALE model of thinking your poetry has value only if you can
"overthrow the enemy." My problem with his introduction is not that it
departs from the avant garde manifestos of writers like Breton, Olson, on
down to Silliman, etc., but that IT LOOKS TOO MUCH LIKE THOSE MANIFESTOS.
 
8)      But the idea that Lew's work, however interesting or not, is a
statement of MY poetics, or that of Steve Evans or Jena Osman or whoever,
simply escapes me completely. And that would be true even if I thought
everything Lew did was great.
 
9)      To what extent does the discourse of the avant garde remain
fundamentally linear, imperialist, etc on the subject of form, the
social, etc?

Some additional comments on my previous missive:
 
1)      What role does GENEROSITY of response to other poets play in who
is considered "important", etc. Is attacking the writing of the past the
same as a claim to "seriousness"?
 
2)      I WANT TO SEE LESS MANIFESTOS
 
3)      Notice that hegemonic "grouping" practices can be used by
everybody against everybody, and they always suck.
 
4)      Charles Borkhus: "You originals/are the biggest dupes" Whether
one believes that or not, to what extent is the concept of originality on
the level of form a problem rather than a given good?
 
5)      If a revolution were to occur, what makes poets so sure that we
would be part of it, rather than what was being fought against?
 
6)      Isn't it possible that everything we know is still wrong? Or at
least not more right than previous generations of writers have been?
 
7)      Jefferson Hansen: "I don't know what I think. Hence I am crudely
ecletic." Does that make him a WEAK poet? What if it did?
 
8)      Will somebody please say that discussing poetry doesn't have to
be the same as a battleground? (excuse me now, I have to go put on my armor)

Subject:      "apex of the M" - essay excerpt
 
For those of you who are interested, what follows is the preface and
footnotes to an essay I have written on the "apex of the M" preface. I
present the essay in its abridged form here in part to spare you too much
text and for the simple reason that I have it "out" to an editor in hope of
publication. My response the the "M" centers upon a notion of "act" is
which I feel undermined by the eschatological.
The "footnotes" which folow actually contain their own argument and flesh
out more fully what I mean by "act."
Toward the end of the body of the essay, which is aphoristic in its
construction, I quote a critical line offered by Ron Silliman in the
"Chinese Notebook"
 
20.) Perhaps poetry is an activity and not a form at all.....
&
25.) How can I show the intentions of this work and poetry are
        identical?
 
Here I ain't talkin' 'bout my ge...ge..genuflection.
 
I would be happy to send the body of the paper to anyone who'd like it.

 "Only Be Sure to Spare the Poet's House."
 
 
Put it all to the torch! And the king named one by one
the towers, the gates, the temples   this marvel of the world;
then brightened, as the thought leaped into words:
"Only be sure to spare the Poet's House."
Akhmatova: from Alexander at Thebes
  Leningrad, October 1961
 
 
 
        What follows is in part a response to a recent editorial preface published
in the first issue of "apex of the M."   My initial response upon reading
the preface was something of a fever, a visceral anger over the tactics
chosen by the editors. Among other things the preface urges a re-figuring
of poetry toward a "millennial" poetry; a proffering of the
"eschatological" and the acknowledgment of the "sacred" as an orientation
in this "iconoclastic" re-figuration.  On further reflection, it became
clear that the gnostic territory marked out by the editors is an extreme
violation of the very things they advocate. I wrote this response to allude
to another radicality which turns the editor's contentions inside out, a
radicality which alters the grounds toward which such theological terms
attempt to surface.
 
 
        The poet's house in the above epigraph is a protectorate   it suffers an
enjoined sovereignty. By torching Thebes, yet sparing Pindar's house,
Alexander makes of the poet's house a protectorate within an eviscerated
political and ideological history   a situation which speaks poignantly
about Akhmatova's condition in Soviet Russia in the early 1960's.1 This
protectorate is a historically ramified condominium; condominial in that it
becomes the locus of its own negation, an index of a history apart   spared
only as a remnant.  The tyranny of Alexander's rule is not mitigated by his
benevolence to the poets (and priests) of Thebes. By being spared the
torch, the poet's house is brought into the state, and made a colony of its
ideological adventurism.  In a similar fashion, the editor's preface to
"apex of the M" makes of the poet's house a protectorate through its
reference to Dante's benevolent Monarchy.2 The concept of the monarchy
arriving at the new Millennium folds this protectorate around our
action/writing. The proposal of a millennial poetry guts the act of its own
potential; the cultural and historical magnetism of the Millennium is
powerful enough to push historical perspective into a future which is
beyond its own significance. It is a warped projection which hurls the act
into a future of its own making. This warp enables a projection of
"consciousness' which for many reasons is an aberration of any sense of the
continuity of work. The thought of this projection and its working through
is in fact suspended by this hurl into the future; this "thought" is
propelled by its own idea and is a self-serving futuring and is not arrived
at through historical immanence. In other words this gnostic sparing is an
evacuation of history through a constant futuring; an eschatological desire
which distances desire and history from the moment of act. This maneuver
proves quite similar to Alexander's sparing, but in "M" the house is
"spared" instead through the sacred as a sacrifice to the Other. In
material history, the poet's house cannot be spared by either monarchy;
both monarchies only gaze from a distance at the poet's house; they reach
only to the threshold of its potential. As though in the flames engulfing
Thebes, the thousand lights flickering off the M into the heavens3
illuminate the poet's house as only an iconographic way-station, postponing
history until the fulfillment by an other. This other never being
accomplished refutes action.4 History in the case of any imperialist
tyranny is absorbed by that tyranny   the ash surrounding the poet's house.
History in the case of "M" becomes a transfixion, dependent upon the course
of postponed desire. The M's subjects stand transfixed by the flicker, the
meta-physic of the gnostic fire, a fire as tyrannous in its claim on poets
as were Alexander's.
        We begin to see a relationship of the word to history. The force of work
in world is equal to its moment of act as reflected in the word. This is
the word's duration and consequence. Through this examination we also begin
to notice that the image of the M disrupts history, it creates a film on
history which is gesturally opaque   a shadow of the world. The "apex of
the M," in spite of its attempts to be iconoclastic, reapplies the icon in
a most graphic and violent form of usurpation, intended as liberatory, yet
functioning as a rhetorical device which perhaps unbeknownst to the editors
is bent on debilitating human actuality. We begin to see that far from
being iconoclastic the editor's spell cast at the apex of the Millennium
makes of history a fetish. The result of the distance of act from word in
the eschatological breach is that history and the future is idolized,
thematized, made aspect of rhetoric and form. In essence the effect of the
preface to the "apex of the M" is an "iconoclastic fetishism."5
        Within act as a process of work the poet's house is and can only be
continuously engulfed in material history by constantly enacting the
overthrow of any agency.  This is achieved only at the moment of the letter
as it is engulfed in history apart from any agency. Indeed this struggle
against agency is the interminable contradiction of language, its constant
overthrow of its own mediacy. This continuum is itself history; history
apart from rhetoric, from style, from form in activity. This essay is a
brief examination of the poetic act as act in history and is prompted by
the responsibility of this act   a responsibility and a history dodged by
any agency, any Monarchy, be it "Alexander's," or "God's."
 
 
1 At a recent reading given by Michael Palmer he mentioned to the audience
that Akhmatova's house is a national museum, but that it is unmarked and
its location is known to but a few   it is a "secret house."
 
2 In Dante's cosmology, the "M" falling out of the heavens in a procession
of letters (D-I-L-I-G-I-T-E  I-U-S-T-I-T-I-A-M...Q-U-I  I-U-T-I-C-A-T-I-S
T-E-R-R-A-M ) orients the reader to view the M as if with a  partition
between one's eyes. In one eye the M is a promotion of the benevolent
monarchy - God's justice - to be established on earth; in the other eye, as
some critics would have it, the M, in its transformation to a fleur-de-lis,
is a critique of the imperialist ventures of the French Monarchy and of
Florentine political schisms   France had its hand in the ouster of the
Ghibbelenes in Florence and both France and Florence used the fleur-de-lis
as political symbols. This politically partitioned view of the M points to
a secular monarchy and to Dante's critique of a Prince's justice. The
partition of the M is instructive.The moment of the M, of letters, for
Dante is partitioned secular and sacred   the moment of act and potential..
 The schism of act and potential points directly to the schism of secular
and sacred, but through the transparency of angels:
 
'The Angelic intellect is always in a state of pure act that is, its powers
never lapse into mere potentiality, but are at every moment actualized. At
the other extreme of creation, and therefore in the lowest place is pure
matter, the prima materia   which is  pure potentiality   the possibility
of becoming realized in some individual form. Midway between the two stand
man, a union of both. Part of our powers goes forth intermittently in act
or actuality; but part lies inactive as mere potentiality, waiting to be
called into play. And in man this union of act  and potentiality, Beatrice
declares, will never be dissolved. This is sometimes understood as the
union of body and soul, which even death can dissolve only for a time; but
it seems rather to imply that man even in the world to come will never
attain to the pure act of the Angelic intellect   some part of his being
will remain for ever in potentia.'
from In Patria, an Exposition of Dante's Paradiso, Rev. John S. Carroll,
M.A., D.D. , Kennikat Press Port Washington, NY/London, 1971, first
published in 1911. p. 454.
 
When seen through the agency of the Angelic intellect, material act is "for
ever in potentia." This in potentia is the measure of our act, from
without. This external measure results in a violence    an excised history
very similar to that suffered at the words of Alexander. In a subtle, yet
profound shift, if read dialectically, the future does not bestow grace
upon act, act is its own futuring.B With the recognition of the
trans-temporality of act, there is a clearer understanding of how the
poet's house is perpetually engulfed in history; never does it propose a
future, it actualizes history as it's own future.
        To flesh this out further, this notion of act can be likened to the idea
of negotiation put forth by Homi Bhaba in location of culture, (Rutledge,
'94). In the first chapter, "The Commitment to Theory," Bhaba refutes the
possibility of a transparent agent, or of any third person examination of
ideology.  He puts forth Mill's "On Liberty" as a clear example of a third
person , or transparent agency of political ideology   that first marks out
difference (polarization) and then reconciles these differences through a
careful, (and inherently violent) rationale. (For Bhaba, Mill's transparent
agency is a rhetorical/textual manifestation of the political subject
through negation.) Opting instead for a textual, or iterate negotiation,
Bhaba attempts
to position the text in a constant process of emergence from within an
ideological translation. "When I talk of 'negotiation' rather than
'negation,' it is to convey a temporality that makes it possible to
conceive of the articulation of  antagonistic or contradictory elements: a
dialectic,  without the emergence of a teleological or transcendent
History....By negotiation I attempt to draw attention to the structure of
'iteration' which informs political movements that attempt to articulate
antagonistic and oppositional elements  without the rationality of
sublation or transcendence. (pp. 25, 26)
        What does this have to do with a benevolent monarchy? First, gnosticism is
the pre-eminent trans
parent agency. For the gnostic, only God is capable of reconciling act and
potential. Any acceptance of that agency is a subordination to that agency
- a further removal from act's capacity; any acceptance of a transparent
agency, any Monarchy, is an acceptance of a negative, transcendental
history. Second, the iteration of a gnostic history is the proposition of
an Other to which we ascend, of a constant and everlasting potential which
is always undoing the act. The extension of this is that through
transcendence, history is subordinate to gnostic iteration.
        B Any attempt to reconcile act with potential must encounter history at
its moment and this encounter is impossible through any transparent agency
(or angel). In part of the Arcades Project, Benjamin counters very clearly
the agency of angels and proposes a material history in constant
actualization.
The fore- and after-history of historical evidence is made manifest in it
by a dialectical presentation. Further: every historical state of affairs
presented dialectically polarizes and becomes a force field in which  the
conflict between fore- and after history plays itself out. It becomes that
field as it is penetrated by actuality. And thus historical evidence always
polarizes into fore- and after-history in a new way, never in the same way.
And it does so go beyond itself, within actuality per se....(N7a,1)
 
and in another place:
 
in allegory the facies hippocratica of history lies before the viewer's
eyes like a frozen, primordial landscape...(N2,7)
 
                                        from N: "Re The Theory of Knowledge,Theory of Progress,"
 
Act is its own limit and the limit of history. Any agency (any "M") is
allegorical and denies this limit and instead presents a mythic history
an "antediluvian fossil."
 
        As an historical and cultural cross-reference, parts of the argument put
forth by the editors of "apex of the M" are in no way new, or specific even
to poetries of the west. A Japanese literary critic Yashimoto Takaaki used
a similar argument against self conscious, language-centered writing in
Japan in the late 1970's. Yashimoto, reacting to the influence of (French)
post-modern thinkers on Japanese poetry in the '60's, argued that  "to
single out [contemporary] poet's individual characteristics from the ground
of their sensibility and the solipsism of their thought has become
meaningless."
[See the introduction to An Anthology of Contemporary Japanese Poetry,
Leith Morton Ed (1993) and Trans and Yashimoto Takaaki, Zomho Sengoshiron
(Tokyo: Yamata Shobo, 1983)  (The above quote is borrowed from Morton's
anthology, page xxiii.)].
 
        3  These thousand lights have been said to be the transcendence of writing
itself; the individual letters actually writing the world onto the face of
divine justice - the joined matter and spirit, act and potential in the
Jovian sphere. See chapter two of Jermey Tambling's Dante and Differance,
Cambridge, 1988.

Subject:      Re: G2
 
As to the Evans-Silliman exchange:
 
I appreciated both posts.
But Steve's I found especially useful for clarifying
a lot of the problems that I had with Silliman's original post.
What I find most frightening about Silliman's arguments is
his reduction of everything in Buffalo
or even elsewhere in the nation to a sort of spiritualism
(it is the only grouping that he acknowledges as really
having any seriousness)
that finally isn't representative of the larger picture.
 
For starters, as Jena made clear, neither of the editors of Chain
are on the board of Apex of the M.
Chain in fact is a journal that in many ways pursues an opposite
agenda as that of Apex--
it is anti-editorial, anti-grouping. The use of the device of the chain letter
in the first volume was explicitly intended to expand community
definitions beyond editorial privilege
(Jena and I wrote about the success and failure of this project in our
"Editors' Notes").
Also neither of the editors of the Technique volume are on the board of
Apex of the M. But while this is probably just a confusion on Silliman's part,
it also seems in some ways indicative of his blindness to anything
going on in what seems to be called G2 poetry beyond spirit.
Beginning the Technique volume with the Spirit section
was something that went counter
to my editorial wishes and knowledge
(I wanted to open with the broader "word and world" section),
but also I think should not be read as "aggressive."
Peter argues that when he sent this volume off to the printers
with the spirit section first, it was to try to offer some
connection with the Presentation volume--
both begin with Abbot and end Ziolkowsky.
I am willing to chalk it up to alphabetical accident.
But also I don't think that
any more than the twenty-one poets in the spirit section
have much to do with spirit (and come on, even of these twenty-one,
beyond a statement of an idea of poetics
as being transformative, it  is hard to see these poets as a unified group--
Miekal And, Lisa Jarnot are hardly spiritualist poets
that would meet the rigors of definition proposed in Apex--
this confusion or expansion of the categories in this collection
was an editorial intention).
Finally, to see the anthology as spiritualist is to
do a great and serious disservice to around one hundred other poets.
Just as to say that the anthology indulges in
"increasingly modest forms"
is to do a great disservice to a whole slew
of writers (who are these people, Ron?
who is "returning to the lyric?
what are their numbers in this volume?
who is draining the social?
what is the social and why is the lyric not social?--
these are all innocent questions on my part,
I need more specifics to actually begin to discuss this topic
which is one that seems very urgent to me).
It is, to just list some names at random,
unfair to Lee Ann Brown's and Karen Kelley's attention to sexuality,
unfair to Kevin Magee's mix of formalism, class struggle, and history,
unfair to Myung Mi Kim's attention to relation,
unfair to Susan Gevirtz's complicated feminism and attention to subjectivity,
unfair to C.S. Giscombe's attention to identity.
It is also I think unfair to the overt
political intention in the anthology to include as many women as men
(something that other anthologies of alternative poetry
don't even come close to attempting and something that
never seems to get mentioned in any complaint about this collection).
Further, I am no longer sure any more, although I would have been a year ago,
that a return to the lyric is a draining of the social.
For starters, it is difficult to separate the social from any form.
Susan Stewart's recent work on the lyric has done a lot of change
the way I think of this form.
 
Also, I don't see the anthology has having a
"reluctance to acknowledge or own its own position."
It seems rather that there is a complication in the anthology of what it means
to have a position (an identity, a school, a gender).
Steve Evans's introductory piece is good on this.
If there is anything that sits owl-like overlooking a younger generation
it isn't language poetry
anymore than it is the New York school--
it is rather attempts at categorization, at bunker mentality.
Much of the work of what might be called G2 reacts against this
and in very interesting and innovative ways
(Apex is an obvious exception to this in their editorial return to
a concept of poetic discourse as war).
Perhaps the reason such a collection seems such a strange beast
to Silliman is that it is so different than
the rigorous, mathematical model of ITAT. It is a collection of
younger poets--
all of whose writing will change dramatically in the next years.
I prefer to think of the anthology
as more of a phonebook than even an anthology
(these complaints about the authority of this
anthology that are happening in Joel's post and in the discussion of anthologies
at the beginning of the year are very alien to me--
what authority? the whole thing
was thrown together and knows it).
The numbers will change, people will move,
but it is an attempt at a demographic for the year. It claims no completeness.
It doesn't tell you not to read the books of the authors included.
At best, it is a reference tool.
At its worst, it is difficult to read because it includes so many writers.
 
All of this has put me in the uncomfortable position of defending
something that I have worked on.
But while I acknowledge a lot of omissions and other problems
with the anthology, I also believe that a lot of the work in it is important.
I stand behind this work by other people because it has meant something to me.
I don't find this work a repetition of language poetry
nor does it seem to me upsetting
that there are
"no literary devices in that collection that you cannot already find in
The New American Poetry, In the American Tree, or The Art of Practice"
anymore than it upsets me that there are no devices in these anthologies
that one cannot find in as inclusive a project as America: A Prophecy or
maybe even the Norton.
It is emphasis and idea and use of device here that is important.
Not device itself.
 
I hope this makes sense. I would enjoy complaints and clarifications.

P.S. Please excuse erratic returns, they are not poetic attempts but
rather just attempts to stop the line being cut in two.

As someone struggling with my own dissertation on the Objectivists, i
found this image of a newly freed Melnick in platform shoes, an image
apparently hovering just behind the text, delightful.  Problem is, i'd
read the poem before & never been visited by this apparition.  And
maybe i'm only advertising my own lack of in/sight but i defy anyone to
conjure it from those pages in INTAT alone. The point is that
in its absence, i'm not sure how clear the whole "gender fuck" issue is
(wasn't clear at all to me).  The larger point, as i see it, is
that many of these sorts of discussions, of poetry and "the
social," posit a larger (reading) context for the poetry that is simply
an illusion (despite the fierce energy and intrinsic interestingness of some of the
discussion).  Where i live i am defined against almost everyone i know by
the fact that the latest ish of Talisman or Sulfur might be found lying
around my apt.  That puts me in a pretty small group--yet i'm pretty far
out of the loop when it comes to the current G1/G2 debate--much of which,
it strikes me from the outside, will turn on precisely those Melnickean
personal filigrees to which Ron alludes--and these are supposed to verify
the political dimension of the work?  And on this point, i have to say,
despite my longstanding sympathy w/ the LangPo effort, that if people
have insisted on objecting to what they see as that group's
exclusionary emphasis on the centrality of language (which is key to
the claim for social efficacy of poetry), it is only because the original
writings are full of such assertions of linguistic centrality.  It may
be true, as Silliman indicates, that no one actually believed it, but the
extremism of assertion was itself part of the way the "group" worked and
undoubtedly a crucial factor in its "success" (w/in an extremely limited
field).  The question remains: what is the larger social efficacy of the
sorts of "resistances" LangPos have advocated?  How exactly does the social
enter the poem and the poem the social?  How do discussion like these
keep from remaining hopelessly INTERNECINE??

Steven Shoemaker's question is an important one: How does the social
enter the poem; how does the poem enter the social?  Such questions seem
highly valuable in ascertaining not only relationships between aesthetics
and the larger social world, but the place of the arts (and artists) in
that world.  I'm very interested in hearing what other people's ideas are
about such notions of influence between the social and the personal,
particularly as they relate to aesthetic production and their
place/influence/relationship to history and context.  I've been exploring
Marxist, particularly Gramscian, views of how the social and the
aesthetic interact but I have the sense that they, while useful, remain
vague and ill-defined.  The notion of "use" that was raised seems
pertinent, but I'll have to reread (always) those entries to see if they
can be inserted into Steven's question.  I am always reminded of Emerson
in "Art" where he finds the distinction between the useful and the fine
arts limiting and stifling--perhaps the answer (were there ever any one)
would lie in that direction.

Isn't "the poem", lock schlock and barrel, constituted by a writer who
has continuing relations with the body politic, like it or not --
thrown-ness as in Jim Morrison  (rr or r] & Charles Bernstein have
liked to say -- following Heideggr, I guess.  Oh yes aesthetics
happens somewhere else then where, old bean, huh?  Aesthetics is a
blind for social and money interests mainly.
 
 Confucius never found anyone who was disinterested --  & that
makes questions for a whole tradition of separations and purifications
in the name of art (i.e. Milord's fetishized pictures and objets d'art,
later property of  boards of trustees of museums, or MS of  Vergil, as
sandwiched in plastic sheeting in Vatican to be literary.  Poet's
letters, Palgrave and subsequent anthologies in the college market].
 
Jean Calais's translations of Villon are all in vain....Everyone wants
to be a big artist these days.  There must be more in poetry than
anyone has thought.  Could it be that there is a real power in it/always
 ideologists want to bring it under their control, as instrument.  Like
music, it keeps on escaping ideological control clutches, saying more
than it means to, or less.  Let's hope there is a real poet among the
new  writers, or even two.  Surely "G1" or any G at all including G-6
(dead poets of circa Mallarme's time will welcome them, by opening
new readings to us, readings we had missed, but which may be what
we have always really longed for.  Belonging to no G in the U.S.
(wrong age) but listening as a reader/user to several  U.S. G's with
pleasure, excitement, appropriative glee, there is no reason to
choose among generations, only to pick out the plums.  This you
learn in "art history", who says there's progress between
generations, so that noone can consider themselves righteous
who can make use of "early"  artworks?   Does the saying of a poem
work like a charm as entry to a space of thoughts and language
issues and  issues of living and the politics of living or not?
Noone can quite tell what will prove to be useful and
sometimes it happens that a misprint retained does the trick.  L=  was
marvellous because it accepted that conscious control of  the way
words got into the poem could be consonant with disorders that
seemed to be the preserve of chance procedures or of lyrical
speaking with tongues.
 
It did not only "displace" "personal poetries"  (Downtown poetries
various, variously remaining in some degree acceptable or with
affinities) but also the hopes for the upsurge of deep image to
recreate the body and the body's politics.   I look to see with interest
which models from the recent G's various will reappear as the
mashed potatoes for the younger poets.  I could see aspects of beat
poetry being valuable as well as the "spiritual" poetries of say Robt
Kelly or George Quasha....
 
If I see the arts as a zone for freedoms, someone will now surely tell
me my responsibilities. __ That sounds like a job for Ron Silliman. __
  I'm impressed with Tom Mandel's comments on "use" and I hope
this will be seen as pushing in something of that direction as well as
a rejoinder to the Shoemaker questions.

Subject:      Re: "apex of the M" - essay excerpt
 
Although I've been presumptuous enough already, I left off two important
notes in the excerpt:
 
 
4 My progression to a notion of poethics can't help but take up, through
parallel, Levinas' notion of Heideggers' Ontology. In Otherwise Than Being
(pg. 103) Levinas charges Heidegger with doing to Being what the M'sters
have done with any notion of making, or of poetry.
 
Ontology as first philosophy is a philosophy of power. It issues the State
and in the nonviolence of totality, without securing itself against the
violence from which is nonviolence lives and which appears in the tyranny
of the state. Truth, which should reconcile persons, here exists
anonymously. Universality presents itself as impersonal; and this is
another inhumanity....A philosophy of power, ontology is, as philosophy
which does not call into question the same, a philosophy of injustice. Even
though it opposes the technological passion issued forth from the
forgetting of Being hidden by existents, Heideggerian ontology which
subordinates the relationship with the Other to the relation of Being in
general, remains under the obedience to the anonymous, and leads inevitably
to another power, to imperialist domination, to tyranny. Tyranny is not the
pure and simple extension of technology to reified men. Its origin lies
back in the pagan "mood," in the enrootedness in the earth, in the
adoration that enslaved men can devote to their masters.
 
 
5 In Iconology (Chicago, '86) W.J.T. Mitchell plots out some of the
rhetorical image-making used by Marx and his contemporaries in an effort to
get to an understanding of "The Rhetoric of Iconoclasm." From the chapter
so titled he examines empiricist and idealist models of history to
illuminate Marx's critique of fetishism and "its dialectical counterpart,
the phenomenon of iconoclasm." Although his argument in no way resembles my
own, I feel there is an pertinent quote from the passage called "the
Dialectics of Iconoclasm:"
 
Iconoclasm has a history at least as old as idolatry. Although it always
tends to appear as a relatively recent, revolutionary breakthrough,
overturning some previous established cult of image-worship (the Protestant
Reformation breaking with Roman Catholicism, the iconoclasts of the
Byzantine Empire opposing the patriarch, the Israelites escaping Egypt), it
regularly presents itself as the most ancient form of religion a return to
primitive Christianity, or to the religion of the first human creatures,
before a "fall" which is always understood as a fall into idolatry. Indeed,
one might argue that iconoclasm is simply the obverse of idolatry turned
outward toward the image of a rival, threatening tribe. The iconoclast
prefers to think that he worships no image of any sort, but when pressed,
he is generally content with the rather different claim that his images are
purer or truer than those of mere idolaters. (page 198)

This is a bit of a long post, which is, I know, against the rules, and,
worse, rude. I apologize in advance, but having initiated this
discussion, there's a lot I need to say at this point. The multitude of
repsonses have been extremely interesting in their diversity and
inventiveness, but none has yet convinced me that the phrase "experimental
poetry" is either meaningful (apart from idiosyncratic imaginations
of it : private languages) or particularly useful. On the contrary,
after everyone has said their piece, it seems more confused and confusing
than ever. For me, the most attractive defense so far has been Robert
Kelly's, which he achieves by returning experiment and its science to
their mysterious alchemical sources, and the notion of proceeding not
knowing what the outcome will be. Even then, though, the idea that only
some poetry is initiated not knowing its outcome seems based on the very
same violent taxonomy I was trying to shed some light on in the first place.
 
If we take this secondary definition of experiment as the operative one
in relation to poetry, the unspoken implication is that there is something
we can call non-experimental poetry. What exactly would that poetry be?
Poetry that knows what its outcome will be before it starts? What does
"outcome" mean here? What the poem ultimately "says"? How the poem
ultimately "works"? Frankly I don't think I know of any poetry like that,
even the poetry I am least interested in. Even the most predictably
conventional, it seems to me, can, and frequently does, contain surprises,
the unexpected. To know the outcome before you write is to produce manuals,
not poems. Even someone like Timothy Steele, I'd argue, doesn't know
what results his rhymes will produce before he writes them.
 
Perhaps the key is the word "conventional". Or, dare I say it,
"predictable", thus returning us to the world of experimentalism. (But
if a poem is predictable, can't this be part of an experiment?
Experimenting to see if certain conventions will produce consistently
predictable results?) Let's say there is a complex structure of
conventions the poet has at her disposal, conventions that extend from
phonetics to syntax to semantics to form (something like the grammetrical
model Donald Wesling works out in *The Chances of Rhyme* and *The New
Poetries*). In one sense, a poem embodies a structure of choices
(conscious or unconscious, controlled or random) that array language in
complex relation to those conventions. Certain patterns of convention
dominate at any given moment the cultural sense of what constitutes a
contemporary poem.
 
We recognize Shakespeare's sonnets as poems, even great poems, at the
same time we know they are not contemporary poems. Compare them with
Bernadette Mayers' or Jack Clarke's sonnets. Their sonnets are
absolutely contemporary in every way, even though, or maybe especially
because, they work with a 600 year old form. I don't know how Bernadette
would refer to her work, but I think Jack would blanche at the word
experimental. You could say Los doesn't experiment, Los creates. Is
this a meaningful distinction? My sense is that every phoneme, every
stress, every rhyme, every reference in Jack's sonnets work within
and against the array of conventions to mark out a moment of awareness
of the particularity of the astonishing complexity of relation between
language, thought, myth, history, sound, silence, rhythm, self, other,
social, personal, elsewhere, here, time, and eternity. What Girogio
Agamben calls "whatever being" in *The Coming Community*. This is not
something I would think of as experimental.
 
Let me go back to the question of the relation to convention
as a way of distinguishing between poetries. Let's assume that at certain
times certain conventions dominate writing to the point that they no
longer even seem to be conventions, they are simply seen as constituting
(good) writing. And as a result, meaning itself becomes predictable and
conventional. Moreover, the conventions can be seen as upholding certain
conventional and oppresive forms of life. One alternative for a poet in
those circumstances is to try to subvert the forms of life by subverting
the dominant conventions in her work.
 
Is this something people mean by "experimental"? And if so, is it more
important under these conditions to not know what you're doing (what
your desired outcome is) or to know? Or is it possible in some sense to
both know and not know at the same time? Say, to know generally, but
not to know specifically. What does it mean to not know in this context?
 
Let me return for a moment to the idea of a situation in which a specific
form of literay convention has become authoritarian and can be seen as
upholding certain oppressive forms of life. In this situation, is it
possible to address, even subvert, those oppressive forms of life from
within a writing based on those dominant conventions? I think this is
the kind of writing Keith Tuma referred to a few months ago during the
great anthology debate, i.e. the writing of someone like Thom Gunn, or,
say, Louis Zukofsky when he's writing sestinas.
 
If we acknowledge that it is possible, that means that the link bewteen
the forms of literary conventions and the forms of life is metaphorical,
not actual, and that some other issue is at stake here in the writing.
Let's call it "meaning", where we understand that in a broad sense of
the overall signifying power of the poem, the numinous "cloud" of
significance generated by the totality of the poem's phonic, visual,
semantic, and temporal structures.
 
In this model, the relation to convention, while meangingful, does not
determine meaning. If we understand "experimental" poetry to be poetry
which resists in some way(s) the dominant conventions by "not knowing"
what it's doing, what its outcome is, it could in any case still be
upholding the very oppressive forms of life it seems to be subverting,
or trying to subvert. That is, it could banal, predictable, pretentious,
self-indulgent, tedious--even authoritarian (and, as Joel Kuszai pointed
out, sometimes is).
 
What, then, is the use of this distinction? Rather than clarifying the
issues facing writers today, it obscures those issues by creating a
dualistc taxonomy which implicitly attaches value to sheer formal
exuberance or lack of control or even ignorance.
 
I know there's a whole other dimension to this question that has to do
with practical considerations of identity, recognition, publication,
government money, etc. A number of people made interesting observations
about these issues and the question of lables. These are important
questions, but they're not questions of principle. They should not be
confused with principles, nor allowed to confuse them.

Mike,
 
        In the airport recently I observed a man wearing a tee shirt
upon which was written, in huge block letters:
 
                        WHY?
 
                        BECAUSE I SAY SO.
 
This to me sums up this question re: the issue of "experimental"
(allowing that we are not talking any more, which would yield no
results, postulating a hypothesis and then trying to prove it.)
 
        What I mean to say is that if you take Timothy Steele or
people secure in the academy more importantly, where these people come
from, that they are invested with some authority and the line really
falls where they have the confidence (vs permission, in Duncan's
sense) of being able to "say so."
 
        I mean when I saw the t shirt I thought who is his audience,
his children, his significant other, airport personnel. But in the end
it didn't matter to whom it was addressed (maybe it was only to me!)
there was no doubt from the look in his eyes, whether he was going to
be "experimental" or "conventional" that his audience would have to
yield.
 
That's the point I'm thinking as I do my own scribbling somewhere
out of his way.

I've found virtually every response to my last post really valuable and
useful. Especially Juliana's.
 
But I don't want this to be reduced to a "generational debate" since I
don't see "winners" or "losers" but rather think I (personally) have a
lot to gain from getting the sorts of insights that seem right now to be
just popping out the various posts. Roadmaps to the writing are
especially valuable.
 
Besides, if this is going to be Oedipal, I know which role that puts me
in, thank you...
 
Some thoughts here on a few of Mark Wallace's comments.
 
>
>1)      It is a standard hegemonic (not to mention racist and
imperialist)
>move to take one piece of writing by some particular "group" (as it is

Yo, Mark. I'm not saying there's anything "wrong" with the Apex cluster
and am trying to read them, not dismiss them.
 
One of many valuable lessons I learned from Jerry Rothenberg about 25
years ago was that it's very hard for any writer to read the work of
people 20 years or more younger than him or herself. Writers of the NAP
generation tended to cluster w/ regards to my own G1 into the following
patterns:
1) Couldn't read it, didn't try
2) Wasn't what they expected, so dismissed it outright, sometimes w/
great hostility
3) Tried to be generous, but didn't really get it
(this was/is almost a majoritarian reaction)
4) Read it with interest, insight and made valuable responses to it
 
W/ regards to G2, G3...Gn, I'd like personally to aim for #4.
And would appreciate any help I can get.
 
 It is even hegemonic, racist, and imperialist to refer
>to them as a "group."
 
What is the point of writing a collective "state of the art" if people
don't take it seriously as collective action? I'm not the one grouping
them together. I will admit that use a governmental/institutional frame
such as a "state of the art" address does put one into some heavy
metaphoric territory. They're the ones who announced that they were the
government, no?
 
Let's avoid flame wars of hyperbole and character assassination if
possible. It makes it harder to read the work.

Actually, Pound was interested in social liberation. But he had a
profoundly fucked up idea of what that might mean. The other point about
making it new and the promotion of a poetry that fits the concept is one
that the New Formalists have already made. Interesting to see it here.
 
>4)      To see the "lyric" as somehow a force of social conservatism is
>simply HISTORICALLY UNVERIFIABLE. The lyric form, like the use of
>parataxis, collage, sonnets, whatever, is a possibility that can be
made use of, or discarded, in a variety of historical situations.
 
 
I think that a social examination of the lyric is a great project to
think about working on. I've even contemplated the idea of a booklength
study. Especially since the definition of lyric changes I think (part.
in the late 19th century) as its differentiation from dramatic &
narrative modes dissolves in poetry due to the arrival of other more
powerful dramatic/narrative media, the novel, cinema, etc. Pound's
tripartate logopoeia, phanopoeia, melopoeia are an attempt I think to
rescue that earlier distinction, essentially dividing lyric into all
three houses of the poem. But the underlying question becomes, what is
the social meaning of the lyric? In O-blek 12, as I read it, it seems a
return to the personal and local, which in turn can mean a lot of
things. I'd like to figure out just what those are.
 
In general, I think that all forms are amoral and can be used from any
poltical/social position depending on the context.

EXACTLY!!
 
 
>7)      In fact, my objection to Lew Daly's introduction to Apex of the
M is... that it repeats the same Oedipal MALE model of thinking your
poetry has value only if you can "overthrow the enemy." My problem with
his introduction is ... that IT LOOKS TOO MUCH LIKE THOSE MANIFESTOS.
>
 
It wasn't Lew who signed it. According to Alan & Kristin, they all
worked on it together, to the point that even some sentences were
collaboratively written.
 
>8)      But the idea that Lew's work, however interesting or not, is a
>statement of MY poetics, or that of Steve Evans or Jena Osman or
whoever,
 
Nobody ever said it was. Or Jena's or Juliana's or Joel's or most
anybody else in O-blek 12 except for the very particular few who
actively commit themselves to some version of its argument. So people
like Will Alexander and Elizabeth Robinson stand in an interesting
relation to it, not a part of that declaration but obviously very
sympathetic to its conception of a spiritual poetics. Not clear at all
how they would stand w/ regards to State of the Arts rather bellicose
stance toward the past.
 
I have found people in O 12 who themselves felt that putting the spirit
section first in Technique "yolked" them into its general thrust and
felt very much ripped off by that, precisely because they did not buy
into the underlying argument and felt that putting it first created a
sense of that. I've heard that from at least 5 contributors.
 
The value of State of the Art is that it makes explicit what O 12's
editing structure seems to imply. Very hard to read it as an accident of
the alphabet.

I thought it was clear from my opening comment that my remarks were not
directed at "attacking" the comments made by any one particular post.
It's interesting that my attempt to avoid doing so can be taken that way.
 
Some further responses, this time in particular to what Ron has said.
 
1)      I think I was suggesting, at least partly, that the reductive grouping
of various poets BEGINS in the introduction to the Apex of the M. By
turning "Language Poetry" into some one particular thing, they
unfortunately invite the kind of attacks that turn THEM into one
particular thing (altho I find it unfortunate that that is what had to
happen)
 
2)      I think it may be a stretch to say that Pound was ever interested
in liberation, altho he may have been interested in revolution. I really
do wish that history bore out the conclusion that revolution and
liberation were the same thing, but I'm afraid it doesn't. And to say
such a thing is not to say that revolution is bankrupt, by any means. But
reductive thinking about what revolution entails (and again, this is not
to say that anyone has done this recently) is NOT going to help
revolution be successful.
 
3)      The idea that poets respond to the past as much as remake the
present does not imply a return to radical formalism any more than noting
that the avant garde has traditionally been racist and sexist is a
conservative insight.
 
4)      The idea I want to put forward is that we need to rethink the
relation of the avant garde to the history of social liberation. And I
think it's not at all clear that avant gardists have always been as
socially revolutionary as they would like to claim. I think it's not at
all clear that new forms equal greater freedom, altho I do think that
poets can make use of form to respond to changing cultural dynamics. The
unexamined conviction that the avant garde is by definition involved with
social liberation has to be examined, and to say so is not conservative.
 
5)      It may be that there was some group editorial input on the Apex
of the M introductory essay. But the tone and style is undoubtedly Lew
Daly's, as will be clear if one reads his essay in A Poetics of Criticism.
 
6)      In fact, it is quite possible that a "poetic revolution" among
younger poets may find certain ideas in so-called "Language Poetry" to be
reactionary, heavily male-oriented, and wedded to a concept of "make it
new" that itself is conditioned by a certain blindness to the
historical/social/cultural of its own discourse. But I myself would reject
such a
revolution, since I think the poetics of writers like Ron Silliman,
Barrett Watten and others is more complex than that. But the argument I'm
suggesting here is going to be made, and the people who make it will not
necessarily be conservative.
 
7)      I don't see how any of these comments can be considered a
"flaming" attack on anyone's personality, altho I'm tempted to resent the
aspersions that what I've said is "flaming"--and I wonder about the
heterosexist implications of a word like "flaming" anyway.
 
8)      I'm tempted to think that at this point in time, the lyric may be
a socially revolutionary form than the manifesto. But I have no certainty
on this subject. In fact, I guess I think it must be true that the
manifesto is still useful, altho it feels awful tired at the moment.

Some last updates, etc., and then, since I may have helped confuse rather
than clarify matters, I'll shut up (tho I don't really mind confusing things)
 
In #3 of my previous message I don't mean "radical formalism" but
"traditional formalism"
 
What Tony Green says about "internicene" warfare really hits home--it's a
shame that my comments potentially sparked more misunderstanding (as if
we don't already have enough of that). That was not my intention for them.
Perhaps my own frustrated sense that a lot of people were not reading
each other with sufficient complexity led me into precisely the same
error that I was suggesting they were making.
 
On the other hand, I'm never sufficiently comfortable with my own
assumptions about the "significance" of experimental poetry, and so I'm
perhaps equally determined to question the assumptions of others
regarding the value of that work. It's quite possible that when I do
that, it can too easily be read as another call to warfare.

HEY TRIXY!
 
thanks for your response. I've been working on some other stuff
so it took me a while to respond. Hope that's cool. Yeah, I
promise not to send what you write to anyone else. And if you
are really serious I'll stop forwarding you stuff from the poetics
list. I am eager to do other things too.
 
I think - despite the waves of chatter - that something could still
be accomplished on the e-mail thing, although I have no idea as
to what it would be. I mean it's not like we are going to get down
to any level of praxis or meeting downtown some night to break
windows or somthing...which is what I think the political leads
to anyhow...
 
Yeah, I too thought Ron was quite generous with the M'ers. I
mean it is true - he's quite right - they are really trying to do
something, which isn't very normal these days. I don't get the
point of it. And don't worry about the editorial, you should read
Lew's book--talk about incomprehensible! it is great writing, if
you don't mind things being muddled by the psycho-sexual--but
the editorial - the "declaration of war" as Ron seems to think it is
-- the self-appointment to the "government"! -- I love that. I
think Ron's pretty funny too. The problem, for my two-dollars
and eighty cents, with the Apex thing is that they are trying to be
political but are insisting on the spiritual -- which for me is only
political when grouped into assembly for power reasons (i.e. a
church) otherwise the spiritual is like, well, you know, kind of
acquiescent by defualt--I mean sure, Koresh was able to bring
the ATF to his front door--if that's political then let me out
now--the real politics worth examining there is the refusal of the
social--the manipulation of people in the name of "faith" which
always slams the door on the social--here the spirital gets for me
kind of sticky and icky -- like the fear of identity within the
new coasteries -- hatcheries -- the fear of identity there is on
identitarian grounds--the anti editorial mode is still an editorial
- one of acquiescence and consent, however tacit. At least the M
has some fire under their caps...and don't worry trixie, the next
issue is due out soon, and word is that Prevallet wrote this one--
anybody who knows them knows that she has a mind of her own
and that -- even with all the group editing in the world, I think,
she is really into something different than Lew or Alan, or Pam
for that matter--perhaps not hostile to them, but different
enough to make the "group editorial" thing an unfortunate
effacement. They will have to put their cards on the table soon
enough. Poetry as Chillen of the Corn, or Jack-in-the Box will
be gone of roadside ephemera soon enough. I mean the true
"analysis" of our/any generation is to look at where the money
comes from and how it is spent -- anyone can buy a spot on the
literary register, the who's who of who cares
 
been reading the situationists for Bernstein's class, wondering
how people are going to react to it. I am afraid we'll get into a
chapter & verse argument about Debord--maybe people will
like him. Kind of hard to be in school and reading that stuff.
Reminds me of when what's his face in Portland ore. changed all
the street-signs in downtown to "Malcolm X" - it had a pretty
wild effect at the time even if it was simply consumed, just as
that group's efforts during the gulf war were completely co-
opted by the spectacular; I mean going into restuaurants with
gas-masks on trying to scare the eaters into some kind of political
resistance, I mean come on, despite the disruption, I doubt
anyone lost their appetite, and I'm sure there was hefty applause
at the end. How yuppie (fake concerned) of them. The protest
thing pretty much ended with them all "marching" around
downtown portland with a police escort, I mean, led by the
police escort. I remember sitting in my living room with John
the night we started bombing there...we didn't have any
lightbulbs that worked and no TV, just a clock radio, but that
was enough. I felt competely incapacitated by the whole thing.
All we could do was play music. There was only a bit of hope,
word from seattle that some nut had opened fire on I-5 with
some kinda automatic weapon. But that's not what the world
heard. I don't know what the world heard.
 
But the situationists. Shit. I read ten pages of that stuff then start
pacing in my cage. I love it in the anthology where its written
that the goal of the movement was to "complete and displace
poetry." --an aspiration not too difficult to like, although I
wonder what the hell it means. Situationism, as debord points
out in that first part of the "Veritable Split of the S.I. public
circular" book that situationism becomes as much the
understanding of the enemy, who need to know it in order to
fight it (through using it??) and then Trix, who then, may I ask?

that's what I heard/read--perhaps one of us should write to him
and find out. Kind of an embarrassing thing to ask, no?

A marginal concern of mine, not meant to inflammatory:
 
        While they were bombing baghdad at least those of us  who were
"marching" expressed our rage--no matter how contained it was--against
what was going on.  I can't help but think no matter how "consumed" such
actions were (are) that sitting at home with no light bulbs is even more
determined.
        Sorry if this is less than relevant; it seemed important to me.

Subject:      Re: Experiwhat?
 
It would be nice to trace a history of the phrase--"experimental poetry"--I
think it was Tom  Mandel  writing.  That history  I feel sure belongs with
that of modernism--and not just modernist literature--and more partic-
ularly  of its scientisms.  "The arts, literature, poesy, are a science, just
as chemistry is a science" Pound in l9l3. There's a book, CRITIC AS SCIENT-
IST, The modernist poetics of E.P, by one IanBell. Someone was saying Stein
denied  writing experimentally. although  her lab. work with Prof. Wm.
James clearly had a direct bearing on her ideas about  and practice of fiction. The first
definition offered by Zukofsky for OBJECTIVE (ism) is from Optics.  Mod-
ernist scientism seems to  have 2 purposes (at  least), the first having to do
with re-positioning the artist  socially, as more serious  (Pound's essay, "The
Serious Artist"), artistic knowledge  as hardcore, etc. and the second  to
do with establishing the "autonomy of the modernist art object" as we
would today put it.  Precise description of the object, impersonality--here
we have Eliot's  n otorious catalyst analogy--of the writer and so on.  And
so the short  answer to the q   uestion as to why people on this list are un-
comfortable with, can't see the sense of, want no more to do with,  the
phrase  is that the context  which prompted its appearance and the
purposes its served have both long gone.
 
 So another way into, or out of
this discussion, would be to take  that discomfort as a sign of our uneasy
relation with modernism .
