Just received a message from Santa Cruz sharing news of the passing of
William Everson (Brother Antoninus of SF Renaissance group), a
friend and writer/printer.

Inspirations, withanks, flipping thru _Birth of a Poet_ (Black Sparrow '82):


        A knowledge of myth is crucial to a knowledge of vocation.
        In some way vocation is an enterprise, an enterprise of ser-
        vice or discovery, and the moment it becomes that, it be-
        comes mythic. It is this dimension which changes vocation
        from career to witness. (53)

                        *               *               *

        Spontaneous utterance deals with the potentiality of a
        tongue but craftsmanship deals with its limitations. You
        have to learn to balance yourself between them. Use the
        right hand of your power in all its tumultuous pouring
        forth, its torrential sound, its waterfalls of dissonance and
        assonance, its cascades of tonality and inflection. But never
        forget the left hand of craftsmanship always has the last
        word. It defines the line beyond which you have not gone,
        and are prevented from going. (89)

                        *               *               *

        Go now into the great latitude that awaits you out there,
        the reality that is not closing but opening. Seize it in your
        two hands even as you embrace it and wrestle the meaning
        from it in your thirst. But never forget that only the accep-
        tance at the close will yield the mystery of wholeness to
        you, the thing you desire most of all. You have to lose your
        life in order to save it. You have to expend yourself in order
        to find yourself. You gain your life only by giving it up. (193)


                                        William Everson, 1912-1994

        NEW AMERICAN POETRY SERIES COMPETITION


Over the past years, it has become increasingly apparent that poetry is
undergoing a renaissance in the United States.  More poets are writing
original and exciting new works of poetry than there are publishers
willing to publish their work.

In order to help rectify this situation and to encourage other
organizations upon similar courses, The Contemporary Arts Educational
Project, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, and its publishing program Sun &
Moon Press announces a new poetry competition.

Beginning in 1995, The contemporary Arts Educational Project will annually
publish two books in its Sun & Moon Press New American Poetry Series,
chosen through a national poetry competition.

Original manuscripts, which have not previously appeared in book form, are
eligible.  Between May 1,1994 and December 31, 1994 the competition will
consider typed manuscripts of poetry (between 50 and 200 pages in length).
Manuscripts should be accompanied be a cover letter, listing the author's
name, address and telephone number; but no name or address should appear
on the manuscript itself.  All types of poetry written by all ages are
eligible, but the national judges, who will read the manuscripts without
knowing the names of the authors, have been charged to give particular
interest to innovative and original compositions.  Manuscripts should
begin with a title page, followed by a table on contents and the text.  A
$25.00 application fee (in the form of a check made out to The
Contemporary Arts Educational Project,Inc.) for handling and judge's
costs must be included with the manuscript. Manuscripts submitted without
following the guidelines above will be returned.  Please send all
manuscripts to the New American Poetry Competition at the address below.

All entrants will be notified of the final selections by April 30,1995;
however, no manuscripts shall be returned.  By entering this competition,
the applicant agrees that, if chosen, he/she will allow Sun & Moon Press
to publish the manuscript according to the terms of the Sun & Moon Press
contract, which pays 10% royalties on all copies sold.

Subject:      "Recovery of the Public World"

ANNOUNCING "THE RECOVERY OF THE PUBLIC WORLD": a Conference in Honour of the
Poetry and Poetics of Robin Blaser; to be held in Vancouver, Canada,
June 1st to 4th, 1995.

        "Poets have repeatedly in this century turned philosophers, so
to speak, in order to argue the value of poetry and its practice
within the disturbed meanings of our time.  These arguments are
fascinating because they have everything to do with the poets' sense
of reality in which imagery is entangled with thought.  Often, they
reflect Pound's sense of `make it new' or the modernist notion that
this century and its art are simultaneously the end of something and
the beginning of something else, a new consciousness, and so forth.
It is not one argument or another for or against tradition, nor is it
the complex renewal of the imaginary which our arts witness, for, as I
take it, the enlightened mind does not undervalue the imaginary, which
is the most striking matter of these poetics; what is laid out before
us finally is the fundamental struggle for the nature of the real.
And this, in my view, is a spiritual struggle, both philosophical and
poetic.  Old spiritual forms, along with positivisms and materialisms,
which `held' the real together have come loose.  This is a cliche of
our recognitions and condition.  But we need only look at the energy
of the struggle in philosophy and poetry to make it alive and central
to our private and public lives."  (Robin Blaser, from "The Violets:
Charles Olson and Alfred North Whitehead," in LINE No. 2, Fall 1983)

This conference will address many of the concerns voiced by Robin
Blaser's work in poetry and prose over nearly fifty years' writing,
teaching, speaking and living an evolving poetic thought.  There will
be six panel sessions, each exploring a realm of this thought; there
will also be a seventh, convivial session which will give us an
opportunity to speak about companionship in poetry and poetics.

The panels, with possible topics for discussion:

POETICS, THEORY AND PRACTICE: presentation & representation - self &
other - the play of absence - parataxis & hypotaxis - the serial poem
- dictation - the poem as field - the poem thinking - the poem as
argument - theory and practice of language - augury - the visionary &
the prophetic - the construction of modernity - mythopoiesis -
grammatology - logography

PAINTING, MUSIC, SCULPTURE, POETRY: no break with tradition, but a
continuous gathering - continuous breakages and ruptures with
academicisms and canon-makings - field in painting, music, the plastic
arts - Rimbaud's `dereglement de tous les sens' - `the painter of
modern life' - revolution of the word - Duchamp & poiesis -
l'avant-garde - Bach's belief &/in the era of Boulez and Cage

HETEROLOGIES: `religio', a `tying back to' & vision vs. religiosity -
futurity as indeterminable vs a settled & expected transcendence -
dangerousness of the latter - rethinking the cosmos in the 19th
century (Poe, Emerson, Melville, Dickinson) - Blake & cosmos - 20th
century turns - "we are `ventured' by language" - Olson, Whitehead -
science as thought & unthought (Einstein, Foucault) - `scientific
angelism' (Girard) - Merleau-Ponty - Leibniz, Bach, probability,
monadology - Deleuze, `the fold' - heterodoxies, heterologies (De
Certeau) - `God, self, history, and book' (Taylor) - importance &
implications of cosmology/cosmogony as modes of poetic discourse in
relation to the contemporary dominance of philosophies of language &
psychoanalysis - muthos/logos - Plato & the preface to Plato & the
postface - the `other' of philosophy & poetics

ETHICS AND AESTHETICS: modern `isms' and persons - self, other -
Hannah Arendt & the recovery of the public world - the scapegoat,
sacrifice of the other - Marx, Freud, materialisms, positivisms -
Foucault (madness & civilization, archaeologies of knowledge, the
public institution) - the postmodern condition - poet & ideology -
Benjamin, Adorno, Bloch, and others - outsiders (Hans Mayer) & `the
practice of outside' - Nietzsche, the birth of tragedy, the gay
science - `the fragility of goodness' (Nussbaum) - repression &
freedom - Hermes & the parasite (Serres) - the practice of everyday
life - (De Certeau) - nomadology - ethical poetics

EROS AND POIESIS: desire & freedom - eros & agape - self, other -
homoeros, sexualities, `heterodalities' - `sodometries' - the
creative/the destructive, the prolific/the devouring - sexual politics
- the poetics of love

TRANSLATION: `De volgari eloquentia' - Mallarme, `correspondances' -
dictation - mimesis - imitation &/or carrying over - Pound - Nerval,
Duncan, Blaser - music the `upper limit of speech'? - translation &
the sacred - `originality'/`derivation' - `quotation' - Octavio Paz -
before, during, and after Babel (George Steiner) - ethnopoetics,
culture studies, linguistics & translation

COMPANIONS: breaking bread with - a feast of companionship - `the
great companions: Pindar, Dante, Whitman, H.D., Duncan, Spicer, Olson,
Pound, Yeats et al - the everyday & miraculous affection - `the truth
is laughter' - Boston, Berkeley, San Francisco, Vancouver -
teaching/learning - generosities of scholarship - order/strife & human
fulfillment - truth & life of myth

The `Companions' session will be celebrated as a feast.

Obviously, the `topics' outlined above have hardly the stability of
categories, and can easily, and relatively promiscuously, slip from
one session to another; "the map is not the territory," and conference
participants will find their own territories/unterritories to speak
from.  One very valuable guide is Robin Blaser's The Holy Forest, "a
collected poems, that is, as far as I've gone today, 6 May, 1993"
(Toronto: Coach House Press, 1993), available from Coach House, 50
Prince Arthur Avenue, Suite 107, Toronto, Canada M5R 1B5, and

Thanks for the morsel. We're off to Germany in the morning, tired out
after the Learneds here in Calgary last two weeks, plus all the fighting
bout the race conference (but it's going ahead with lots of donations
anyway). I haven't been abel to get to the D book at all - feel bad about
that but will have to wait until Sept now.

Was good to see you in TO, hope yr ok and the summer works. I'll be off
of this, except for a couple of days in July, until late August.

take care,
