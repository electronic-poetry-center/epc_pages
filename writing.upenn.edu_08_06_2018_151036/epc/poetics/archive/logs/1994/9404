                             "Takes a lot of voices
                        to sing a millenial song." <1>

   The majority of poetry people are familiar with small, relatively intimate
scenarios, and many truly like it that way. Nevertheless, with hi-tech
communications capabilities, and various forms of electronic text processing,
the potential topographies <2> of our interactive communities and activities
have widened substantially over the past few years.
   To begin to bring what is a fairly recent concept out in the open, it is
important to stress our use of the idea of technopoetics as a specific term,
the concerns of which we would like to make very clear. Technopoetics
proposed here is not a literary movement. It involves collaboration, with
other people as well as the machines. This process itself is changing and
dividing pervasive notions of what "author" and "publisher" are.

        "The electronic age now enjoys this time of awkwardness before
        the age itself disappears along with its name into the day to day
        of what at Xerox Park they've taken to calling 'Ubicomp,'
        ubiquitous computing..."<3>

   We remember what was written in _Convivio A Journal of Poetics_:
"Poetics is a labor and a threshold where we are working to make an actual
thing...," which "is a continual reformation.... Above all it treats of inclusio
n,
...poetics, 'in the plural,' as Robert Duncan says."<4>  To echo these notions,
as
we move into time, and, as a culture, succumb to technology (television,
automobiles and such, as well as computers and digital intermedia), the
work, our actions must be pluralized in order to maximize the potentials of
the technology and not let them contribute to social fragmentation. In no
way would we want to speak purely of technopoetry or the technopoetic.
"Poetry," "technopoetry" is now, in its potential, something more than a
poem, or a book of poems, in its blending with other forms and other media.
Will Alexander, introducing a segment of the _We Magazine Issue 18_,
describes the work presented as "...a mix of the poetic and essayistic...like
opening up an artery of twilight, and opening up and walking through this
vast new expanse where one is neither one [i.e. poetic] or the other [i.e.
essayistic] but something completely different."<5>
   To state the apparent, this report comes from what considers itself a "first"
world. As one writer has already pointed out, I am speaking from the
perspective of an "unintentional elitism," of a "...live by the modem die by
the modem future of poetry as an electronic medium."<6> This is true, but
needs to be contextualized within the reality of the newness of this
technology. In many ways we are at the beginnings of new technological
spaces, new electronic networks, which begin to enlarge their envelopes
beyond the corporate, military, governmental, academic milieu which it has
benefitted until now. My position is a result of the priviledge of birth and
guidence, of research and exploration, and is accepted as responsibility.
   Among the things revealed in the processes of technopoetics is a new kind
of wear and fatigue of the body. We are in the age of a physical and
mental/consciousness transformation caused by technological phenomena. In
fact, sitting in front of video screens and computer monitors especially might
be likened to what George Oppen once described as "the bright light of
shipwreck" in the poem "Of Being Numerous." Clearly, the predominant
scenario in this and future age is a movement towards "The absolute
singular/The unearthly bonds/Of the singular", our own type of "Insanity in
high places..." in our homes, with the beam of the computer's screen on our
faces as well as those of the police helicopter searchlights above our cities
and suburbs..."By the shipwreck/Of the singular."<7> This points to one of the
obvious advantages of collaboration:  that the time spent by any one
individual can be spread out over a collective.
   There is little chance that our civilization is ever going to be less reliant
 on
computers. "Ours is a time in which ontological questions of truth and
falsehoods are less relevant than issues of control--control of meaning,
control of context."<8> We have been inspired to "seize the media."<9> The
alternative would be to leave it to the disposal of the military industrial
complex.
   As managing editor for _Electronic Journal_, an on-line (Internet) academic
magazine concerned with electronic communication between computer users
and the implications thereof, as editor with We Press (where a group of
editors conspire to "publish" poetry on compact disc, cassette, video and
Internet as well as on paper), in addition to my role as a teacher, I am
intimately involved with high-tech approaches to both poetry/poetics and
the presentation of electronic text. In the spring of 1993, We Press used the
Internet (harbinger of the so-called "Information Superhighway") to
circulate a poetry journal. After this experiment I wrote an essay regarding
the frontier of cyberspace, "We Maga/zine XVII: (A) Textual Experiment."
The essay is a theoretical and practical investigation of the po(e)tentials of
producing a magazine on an electronic network and the attempt to incite a
global community instantaneously through network connections. The essay's
simple conclusion is that there is not a doubt that any publisher with a
computer connected to the Internet (or the digital--video and audio--
networks which are soon to come to many, many households in America, and
the much of the rest of the "first" world) can exponentially increase the
circulation and audience of their publication--and otherwise make
connections which they would not normally make<10>--by transmuting what
they are already involved with to include cyberspace.
   Of course there are severe socio-ideological concerns with regards to access
to the technologies now available, and any fully legitimized network system
must make room and provide equal access for everyone. This is not nearly
close to being a living reality, but with "Ubicomp," and other systematic
plans such as the Information Superhighway, it is likely that we will see
millions more Americans become reliant on on-line services over the course
of coming decades. It is important that we concern ourselves with equilateral
space and learn to cooperatively communicate within the interactive
electronic arena now. This, of course, is easier in theory than practice.<11>
   Before going further, I wanted to briefly connect technopoetics with what
Donna Haraway speaks of in "A Cyborg Manifesto." Haraway writes, "By the
late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time we are all chimeras,
theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are
cyborgs. The cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. The cyborg is a
condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined
centres structuring any possibility of historical transformation."<12> What we
find most liberating in Haraway's work, in addition to its pointed ideology
("...cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what
counts as women's experience in the late twentieth century"), is its
recontextualization of our species as a whole. How anyone can feel they are a
part of the same corpus and mindset as those of the pre-industrial world is
rather mysterious, to say the least. Do you not often feel constrained by the
"metaphysical tradition" which is rooted in what is a truly archaic mode of
thought and action? How much do we actually have in common with the
mind and body set of pre-electronic culture? Cyborgs, "the awful apocalyptic
telos of the 'West's' escalating dominations of abstract individuation," are
concerned with "the relationships for forming wholes from parts, including
those of polarity and hierarchical domination," and are troublesome because
"they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchal capitalism,
not to mention state socialism...often exceedingly unfaithful to their origin."
Haraway's cyborg myth "is about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions,
and dangerous possibilities which progressive people might explore as one
part of needed political work" in an age where "the need for unity of people
trying to resist world-wide intensification of domination has never been
more acute."<13> Furthermore, as Don Byrd explains in _The Poetics of the
Common Knowledge_, "Our fascination to ourselves as cyborgian creatures is
that we combine in our beings the predictability of machines with the
wreckless, independence of singular [?] creatures."<14> As we are presented
with both the predicament and the predictability of culture, as the computer
and other forms of technology, ideological weapons all, begin to dominate our
work places, and other places, we must familiarize ourselves with them and
use them in a project of creating a better society.
   Purkinge is a technopoetics writing collective with whom I am currently
working in Albany. Purkinge improvisationally rends and resews texts in
printed and oral forms,<15> producing a particularly angular "writing"
"centered" from different perspectives. The group invents and promotes new
modes of authorship and anti-authorship, fashioning melodic conversations
in opposition to a system grown entropic. In our experimentations, enabled
by technology (linked computers and multitrack recording equipment), we
insist on the necessity of interactive, intercorporeal elements in our
communication. The group's gatherings reflect a moment in the drift,
theoretically and poetically fusing concept and action.
   Nathaniel Mackey, in an essay on Amiri Baraka, writes of the poet's
"obliquity, the sliding away from the proposed we find in many of Baraka's
poems." Baraka's method "complies with a fugitive, perhaps idealist impulse,
as though 'the mind, moving' might if not outmaneuver such constraints [i.e.
social 'conditions whose limits one cannot escape,' and, by extension, the
poetry produced within such conditions], at least register the need to do so."
The "Obliquity or angularity" of such writingQand the lyric which rises from
the implementation of such a poetics, which also typifies the type of work
done by PurkingeQ"challenges the epistemic order whose constraints it
implicitly brings to light."<16> In Purkinge, a multiplicity of elements, textua
l
modes, and personalities come together in an intertextual play between
sound and voice, meaning and obliquity. We develop a tangential "writing"
style pointed towards the creation of a new mode of authorship in the
movement away from a non-existent center. It is a conversation, a
collaboration, melodic in its ideal. We inhale as well as we exhale, hearts
dialate as well as contract. The group wants poetry that shows similar signs
of life--and we turn the machine on.
   In addition to expediting interpersonal communications, computer/digital
technology has been used technopoetically in the form of hypertext, and
through interactive textually based virtual reality spaces--known as MUDs
and MOOs--on the Internet . According to George Landow,

        "Hypertext, a term coined by Theodor H. Nelson in the 1960s,
        refers also to a form of electronic text, a radically new
        information technology, and a mode of publication.'By
        "hypertext," Nelson explains, ' I mean nonsequential writing--
        text that branches and allows choices to the reader, best read at
        an interactive screen...'" 23

MUD is an acronym for "Multiple User Dimension," which is an
interactive textual-based virtual reality software being used in
cyberspace. MOO stands for MUD Object Oriented, in which characters
are created and whole electronic dimensions--including a type of
hypertexts-- are built. A writer is able to compose by themselves, or
with others, in these spaces.
   We recently spent a few hours with hypertext writers Michael Joyce and
Caroyln Guyer. Michael is a novelist, a cybernovelist, and one of the co-
developers of Storyspace, "the premier hypertext program available
today."<18> Carolyn is coordinator of the woman's hypertext collective High
Pitched Voices. Michael gave a talk, "(Re)Placing the Author:  'A Book in the
Ruins'" in Albany. He reads the Czeslaw Milosz poem "A Book in the Ruins,"
drawing metaphors between it and what he perceives as the condition of
literature today. He promotes hypertext as the frontier of literature, a re-
writing of the process of reading and writing, where the reader, in a sense, is
able to write and rewrite any given book. It is an extreme concept for most
people, who have quite a linear and perpetualized relationship with
literature of all sorts. Joyce reads from Milosz--and interprets:  "The poet
stands in the ruins...it's the modernist moment...but no...this is not what we
see...the poet makes his way into the ruins of a dark building." The building
we read metaphorically as technology, "in so doing the movement itself
reads barrier as gate. What he reads, he writes." The screen is the barrier, a
"gate"--not passable by all. According to Joyce, "Electronic texts present
themselves in the medium of their disolution. They are read where they are
written and they are written where they are read." A mantra throughout his
talk was "print text stays itself, electronic text replaces itself."<19> We see
hypertext as technopoetics in light of its process, which actively promotes
the decentering of singular author, and hope the next phase in the
development of hypertext software will allow for collaborative interaction in
real-time.
   An article in the recent issue of _Poets & Writers Magazine_ paraphrases
Carolyn Guyer, noting the "text chunks," which "replace" themselves, are
"called lexia, which may be images and sounds as well as paragraphs and
their electronic links empower the reader either to submit to the writer's
ordering of the story or to collaborate by manipulating the elements into an
entirely new story."<20> High Pitched Voices is working together in a
collaborative manner on-line. They have a hypertext discussion set up (in
the same manner as the Buffalo POETICS conference), and they work
together to composing hypertext in a MOO.<27> When one enters this
particular electronic space, by issuing a few simple keyboard commands,
they are greeted by the formation of an arch, a pair of mirrored, upper case
"I"s as columnar bases. An inscription reads:  "A roof over our heads, she
said. Appropriate, I thought. Yonic symbol as protection and sign. And....there
are two "I"s here. What more could we want?" A "reader" is invited to follow
links, and, if interested, add to existing texts and create links between lexia.
The group of women involved with High Pitched Voices also holds real-time
meetings in this space, open to anyone who is able to log in. We see
tremendous poetentials in such an interactivity such as this.
   Technopoetics resists the exclusivity of the technology in general, and
maintains a historical awareness that it is merely a forerunner to what will
be customary activity to future generations of writers and artists in the
post-electronic age. With due respect and admiration for the PRE-FACE of
_Technicians of the Sacred_,<28> which asserts PRIMITIVE MEANS COMPLEX,
technopoetics enacts the reversal of that phrase, certain that complex can
mean primitive. We are in age marked by the power of information, the
dominance of technology, yet it is also important to note we're in the
relatively early stages of what will become Ubicomp culture. It is a very
complicated time. We must study and act upon what is happening now--&
stake some grounds here. There are a few collectives and publications
already in this realm, in addition to the aforementioned entities, there are a
number of poetry oriented journals on the Internet (_RIF/T_, _Grist_, _Core_,
_Taproot_, and _Inter/face_ come to mind). Other publishing groups such as
Xexoxial Endarchy and _The Aerial_ are consistently producing poetry in
formats other than the printed page, and Eastgate Systems has been
pioneering in their dedication to the promotion of hypertext publications.
   In 1986, I asked Ed Sanders about his vision of the music of the future:

        "It has to be, in electronics, the equivalent of the piano forte.
        That is, right around the time of Bach they were creating this
        new kind of piano, which was an outgrowth of the harpsichord,
        that allowed its player to be infinitely more expressive, using
        the pedals and playing softly and loud--it enabled the concept
        of the concerto to arise, where the piano was an actually
        powerful instrument that could act in concerto with other
        instruments.

        "So what's going to happen now...is the electronic equivalent of
        the piano forte. That is, there is going to arise a musical
        instrument sufficient for a new Beethoven, and it will be an
        electronic instrument. It will have, obviously, many aspects of
        the modern electronic recording studio and modern high-end
        synthesizer. I envision it like a giant church organ only instead
        of stops it will have fifteen or twenty thousand little buttons or
        knobs & x-y pads & pressure sensitive areas & theramin-like
        devices where you approach these little knobs with your hands.
        The proximity of your fingers to these zones & tiny little
        surfaces will indicate perameters & programs, moods & sounds,
        or whatever....It will be a "touch" thing; I guess the feet will
        have to be involved...in other words you'll have to use both
        hands, both feet, & perhaps a group of assistants. In fact it may
        be a collaborative thing....It will be complicated...you can use
        your touch to modify all these perameters instantly...make
        these sounds, these different layers of sounds, different sounds
        & chords instantly, as you create it..."<23>

   As we find ourselves increasingly--and without much choice--having to
making use of the synthetic strands provided by our civilization's penchant
for technological living, we need to envision ways to weave the threads
given by such an unusual but very real circumstance into a tightly meshed
net which alternatively keeps us warm and catches our breath. Among the
questions raised by the possibilities implicit in our future immersions is the
question of which we want to priviledge, the production of artifacts or the
actual engagement of people in a process of living and creating as an
outgrowth of daily life. To draw an analogy between technopoetics and other
technologies which have long predated the computer, I refer to a collection
of essays called _Radiotext(e)_, the introduction of which reminds us "that
radio existed long before its receiver did."<24> Bertolt Brecht, in his essay
"The Radio as an Apparatus of Communication" suggests we should "Change
this apparatus [radio] over from distribution to communication," and that
"Any attempt by the radio to give a truly public character to public occasions
is a step in the right direction."<25> These are among the ideas we would like
to claim as a basis for a technopoetics in the current historical and
technological moment.

I have always confused the local and the, what?, nonlocal myself
and it may be that everyone on this list should post local events
so we find out what is really happening.

But as it is this list is mostly nonlocal and getting moreso

I am going to send to the Poetics list an essay I
recently presented on the "art object" in an age of electronic

 "I DON'T TAKE VOICE MAIL"

by Charles Bernstein

[Presented at a symposium, sponsored by the Parsons School of
Design, on "The Art Object in the an Age of Electronic
Technology", at the New School in New York, on April 16, 1994]


Before diagnosing the condition of the art object in an age of
electronic technology, let me first address the question of the
object of art in an age of global commodification.  I won't be
the last to note that capitalism transcends the technologies
through which it operates.  So just as today's artworld is
dominated by the marketing, sales, and promotion, so the object
of art in the age of electronic technology will continue to be
profit; and the values most typically promoted by the art world
will continue to be governed by market, rather than aesthetic,
formal, philosophical or ethical, values.
     Within the artworld, as in the corporate board rooms, the
focus of discussion has been on how to exploit this new media, as
if cyberspace was a new wilderness from which to carve your niche
--better get on board, err, on line, first before the prime sites
are staked out.  For if the object of art is to sell objects,
then the new electronic environment presents many problems but
also many opportunities.
     But art, if it could speak, might well object to these
assumptions.  (If art could speak we could not understand it --
that's one way to put it; perhaps it's more accurate to say if
art could speak it would be poetry and poetry's got nothing to
sell.)  -- Art might speak not of its object but it objects; it
might testily insists that one of its roles is exactly to resist
commodification, to use its materiality to push against the total
absorption of meaning into the market system, and that's why it
got one the first e-mail accounts on the net--to talk about it.
But you can't sell talk, and that can make the net a vexing place
for if not for art then for the purveyors of art.
     Of course, today's internet -- a decentralized, largely
text-based, linking of individual sites or constellations of
users -- will be superseded by what is aptly called the in-
formation superhighway.  Just as the old dirt roads and smaller
rural routes were largely abandoned by the megatraffic on the
interstates, so much of the present informal, non-capital
intensive exchanges on the net will become marginal back channels
in a communications systems largely owned and controlled by Time
& Space, Inc. and other giant telecommunication conglomerates,
providing new and continually recirculating versions of the USA
Today with up to the minute weather and sports information, sound
files offering *Nirvana: The Classic Years* including alternate
studio versions, hypertext tours with high resolution graphics of
the British Museum collection, plus hundreds of other choices,
available at the click of an icon, including items never before
available in any media such as *In Her Home: the Barbara
Streisand Collection*; a construct-it-yourself simulation of
making a Shaker chair; and a color-it-yourself portfolio of the
complete appropriations of Sherrie Levine, together with hyper-
textually linked case dossiers of all related legal suits.  All
with modest fees for each hour of viewing or receiving (the gaze
finally quantified and sold) and downright bargain prices for
your "own" personal copy, making available unlimited screenings
(but remember, "it is a federal offence to make unauthorized
copies of these copies", or, as we say in Buffalo: it's okay to
copy an original but never copy a copy).  Indeed, much of what is
now the internet promises to become the largest shopping network
on earth, and possibly in the universe (even exceeding the Mall
of the Milky Way on Galactica B282); those old back roads will be
the place to hang out if you are looking for something other than
franchise FastImage.

One of the hallmarks of formalist art criticism as well as media
theory has been an analysis of the effects of newer media on
already existing media.  So we talk about the effect of
photography on painting, or movies on theater; or how movies
provided the initial content for TV before it arrived at its own
particular formats (just as the content of the net is now largely
composed of formats taken from books, letters, and magazines). It
is useful to remember that in the early days of TV, many
observers predicted that such spectator sports as baseball would
lose their stadium audiences once the games were broadcast
"live".  Of course, the opposite occurred; TV increased the
interest in the live-and-in-person event.  In a similar way, art
on the net may actually increase interest in seeing art in
nonelectronic spaces.
     Formalist critics have wanted to emphasize how new
technologies "free up" older media to explore their intrinsic
qualities -- to do what only they can do.  But new media also
have a corrosive effect, as forces in the older media try to
shift their focus to compete for the market and the cultural
capital of what they may see as their new competitors.  Within
the visual arts, many of the most celebrated new trends of the
last decade -- from simululationism to multimediamania to the
transformation of Artforum -- are symptoms of a fear of the
specific and intractable materiality of painting and sculpture;
such fear of materiality (and by extension face-to-face
interaction) is far greater and long-lasting than the much more
often discussed fear of technology -- a fear so often discussed
the better to trivialize and repress.

What are the conditions of visual art in the net, or art in
computer space?  We can expect that most visual art on the net
will be reproductions of previously existing work, along the line
of Bill Gates's plan to display in his home rotating CD-ROM
images of the masterpieces of World Art, images for which,
notably, he has purchased the CD-ROM reproduction rights.  The
Thing, a new visual arts online service, which has been immensely
useful in imagining many possible formats for art on the net,
already features an innovative, in the sense of anachronistic,
pricing structure--selling over its BBS a numbered and "signed"
diskette of an art work.  (The idea of selling a disk is itself
no more objectionable than selling a book, but numbering and
signing a disk is an attempt to simulate scarcity and limit in a
medium in which these conditions do not apply.  I wouldn't be
surprised, however, if this format was included on The Thing to
call attention to the issue and also to poke fun at the net's
prevailing ideology of utopian democracy, a.k.a. netiquette).  In
any case, telecommunications systems promises to dominate the
distribution of text and image in the near future at a price --
though few are now willing to acknowledge it--of more controlled
and more limited access (through high user fees, institutional
restrictions, and technological skills barriers) and loss of
privacy rights we now take for granted.  But technological change
--it's a mistake to call it progress--will not be reversed and
artists run the risk of nostalgia if they refuse to recognize and
respond, the better to resist, the communications environment
that, for better or worse, they find themselves within.
     I want, then, to focus not on how electronic space will
actually be used, indeed how e-space will be exploited, but
rather to think about the new media that has been created by
technological developments combing computers and
telecommunications, and how works of visual arts can recognize
and explore these new media--even if such works run the risk of
being relegated to the net's backchannels, along with "new mimeo
revolution" poetry magazines and psychic readings by electronic
Tarot.
     The most radical characteristic of the internet as a medium
is its interconnectivity.  At every point receivers are also
transmitters.  It is a medium defined by exchange rather than
delivery; the medium is interactive and dialogic rather than
unidirectional or monologic.  At this moment, the most
interesting format on the internet, apart from the basic
electronic mail function, is the listserve: a series of
individuals join a list--any post to the list address is
immediately delivered to all list subscribers.  Individuals can
then post replies to the entire list or to the individual that
sent the post.  Lists may be open to anyone to join or may be
private.  The potential for discussion and collaboration is
appealing--the format mixes some of the features of
correspondence with a discussion group, conference call, and a
panel symposium such as this one (with the crucial difference
that the distinction between audience and panel is eroded).
     While many cyberspace utopians speak of virtual communities
with much excitement, what is particularly interesting about the
interconnectivity of computer space is its difference from other
types of group formation; for what we are constructing in these
spaces might better be called virtual uncommunities.
     The art world remains a difficult place for community or
group formations because the gallery system recognizes value
primarily in terms of individual achievement.  In contrast to the
poetry publishing and criticism, in which the poets themselves
play a substantial and perhaps determining role, individual
visual artists are largely restricted to (or restrict themselves
to) the role of producers of potentially saleable objects.
Competition among artists is more common that broad-based
alliance, with the occasional exception of loyalty to a small
circle of friends.
     At the national level, or course, there are local
communities of artists in every region.  Various movements and
schools--aesthetic or political or both--can also be understood
as art communities.  Most recently, the connections of artists
within  ethnic, gender, or racial groups have been seen in terms
of community.  But despite these sites of community among visual
artists, sustained interaction, dialogues and collaboration
remains rare; indeed, these activities are not generally
recognized as values.  The internet provide an extraordinary
space for interaction and exchange among artist living in
different places and, perhaps more significantly, encourages
collaboration between visual artists, writers, and computer
engineers.   In a way remarkably anticipated by the mail art
movements of the seventies and eighties, the net suggests the
possibility of art works created for their exchange rather than
market value--works that may be altered, augmented, or otherwise
transformed as they pass from one screen to another.  --What I am
envisioning here is not art from another medium imported into the
net but rather art that takes the unique constraints and
potentials of the net as its medium.
     To begin delineate this and related computer and
telecommunications media, let's start with the "small" screen.
Indeed, we might begin to speak of the screen arts to suggest the
intersection of video, tv and computer art that share the same
physical support or monitor.  More and more computers are now
equipped with video quality monitors and the screen arts--in
this broad sense--will be transmitted via modem, cable and
wireless systems as well as plugged in through cassette, cd-rom,
disk, and cartridge.
     I distinguish among interactive, interconnected, and
presentational screen media:
     Presentational screen media is the broadest category.  On
the one hand, it includes the use of the CPU set-up as a means to
present work realized in a non-CPU medium, such as a video tape
or photographs, or read-only text files. On the other hand,
presentational screen media also includes work produced and
viewed on computer systems that do not require viewer
intervention beyond basic directional and operational parameters
such as those available on a video recorder.  -- A hugely
important subcategory here is works produced on computer screens
but not presented on screens.  Word processing, "paintbrush" and
"photoshop" programs are some of the tools of this medium, which
promises to reimagine the way we read and see text and graphics;
moreover, this new medium allows for a greater integration and
interaction of verbal, visual, and sound elements than possible
with previous printing technologies.
     Interactive computer screen art utilizes the processing
system of the computer and includes significant viewer
participation via keyboard, mouse or joy stick.  While video
games are the most elaborate visual realization of this medium,
works of computer art can be created that are not game-oriented
but that use many of the features developed in video games.
Still another format for interactivity is often discussed under
the general heading of hypertext.  Hypertext involves the lateral
movement and linking of  a potentially infinite series of data
pools.  It allows for nonlinear explorations of a range of data
bases; that is, unlike presentational modes, in hypertext there
is no established forward path through the data.  For example,
Jerome McGann and colleagues are at work on an edition of the
complete works of Dante Rossetti that will include multiple
discrepant versions of his published poems along with ms versions
of these poems, together with his related paintings as well as
source material for the paintings and the poems.  All of this
information will be linked so that one can move through the data
in many directions.  Claims of many enthusiastic hypetextualists
notwithstanding, many of the most radical features of hypertext
are technologies made available by the invention of alphabetic
writing and greatly facilitated by the development of printing
and bookmaking.  Such formats as page and line numbering,
indexes, tables of contents, concordances, and cross-referencing
for in encyclopedias and card catalogs, are, in effect,
hypertextual.  Much of the innovative poetry of the past 100
years relies on the concept of hypertextuality as a counter to
the predominance of linear reading and writing methods.  While
hypertext may seem like a particular innovation of computer
processing, since data on a computer does not have to be accessed
sequentially (which is to say it is "randomly" accessible), it
becomes a compensatory access tool partly because you can't flip
though a date base the way you can flip through pages or index
cards.  (I'm thinking, for example, of Robert Grenier's great
poem, *Sentences*, which is printed on 500 index cards in a
Chinese foldup box.)
     Finally--my third category--interconnectivity utilizes the
network capability of linked systems such as the internet and
formats such as listserves, bulletin boards, newsgroups, and
group-participation MUDs (multi-user domains) and MOOs and other
"real-time" multi-user formats. Inteconnectivity allows for works
of collaboration, linking, and exchange, as well as a the
possibility of simultaneous-event or immediate-response
structures.  Interconnectivity turns the screen into a small
stage and in this way combines features of theater with writing
and graphic art.
     The most static of the three modes I have just defined is
the presentation screen mode.  Presentational screen media will
merge with what is now available via broadcast TV, video
cassettes, or video disk and CD.  But, of course, certain
computer features will provide novel methods for searching or
scanning material, for example, enabling particular item
or graphic or song or word amidst a large data base.
     Yet because computer screens are often smaller than TV
screens, a class of interactive and presentational screen art can
take advantage of the more intimate single-viewer conditions now
associated with books and drawings.  Indeed new technologies for
viewing texts may well supplant print as the dominant medium for
writing and graphics.  Books, I should add, will not be replaced
--and certainly will not come superfluous--any more than
printing replaced handwriting or made it superfluous; these are
different media and texts or graphics disseminated through them
will have different qualities.  Nonetheless, it is useful to
consider graphic and verbal works created specifically for the
intimate presentational or interactive space of the small screen
that use features specific to the CPU environment, including
scrolling, lateral movements, dissolves, the physical properties
of the different screen types (lcd, gas plasma, active matrix
color)--an extension into the CPU environment of the sort of
work associated with Nam June Paikation of the video
environment.
     The status of computer-generated films may help to test my
typology.  Anything that can can also, and with increasing resolution,
be projected on a movie
screen.  Nonetheless, it is still possible to distinguish, as
distinct support media, the small backlit screen of the TV and
computer monitor and the large projection-system screen of film.
Moreover, the scale, conditions of viewing, and typifying formats
make video, film, and TV three different media, just as
animation, photography and computer graphics may be said to be
distinct media within film.  (Hybridization and cross-viewing
remain, of course, and active and welcome possibility.)
Computer-generated graphics, then, may be classified as
presentation computer art modelled on small screens for big
screen projection.
     Note, also, that I have not included in my sketch nonscreen
art that uses computers for their operation (for example, robotic
installations and environments)--a category that is likely to
far surpass the screen arts in the course of time.

[Slide #1: Petah Coyne]  But I don't want to talk about computers
but objects, objects obduring in the face of automation: I
picture here a sculpture from Petah Coyne's recent show at the
Jack Shainman Gallery.   For it has never been the object of art
to capture the thing itself, but rather the conditions of
thingness: its thickness, its intractability, its
untranslatability or unreproducability,semiotic density, opacity,
particularity and peculiarity, its complexity.

[Slide #2: Karen Dolmanish]  For this reason, I was delighted to
see a show of new sculpture at Exit Art last month that seemed to
respond to my increasing desire for sculpture and painting thick
with its material obsessiveness, work whose response to the
cyberworld is not to hop on board for the ride or play the angles
between parasite and symbiosis--but to insist ever more
intractability of its own "radical faith," to quote the title of
this work by Karen Dolmanish

[Slide #3: Byron Clercx]  Object: to call into question, to
disagree, to wonder at, to puzzle over, to stare at --
Object: something made inanimate, lifeless, a thing debased or
devalued --
Whatever darker Freudian dreams of objects and their relations I
may have had while writing this essay, nothing could come close
to Byron Clercx's witty sculpture, "Big Stick," in which he has
compressed and laminated 20 volumes of the complete works of the
father of psychoanalysis into one beautifully crafted Vienna
Slugger, evoking both the uncanny and the sublime ~ finally, an
American Freud.  Here is the return of the book with a vengeance,
proof positive that books are not the same as texts.  Go try
doing that to a batch of floppy disks or CD-ROMs.

[Slide #4: Jess].  In Jess's 1991 paste-up "Dyslecstasy", we get
some glimpse of what hypertext might one day be able to achieve.
Collaged from thousands of tiny scraps collected over many years,
Jess creates an environment of multiple levels and dizzyingly
shifting contexts; and yet in this world made of tiny
particulars, it is their relation and mutual inhabitation that
overwhelms and confirms.

[Slide #5: Susan Bee, "Masked Ball"]  I long for the handmade,
the direct application of materials on an uneven surface.
I feel ever more the need for the embedded and
encrusted images and glossings and tones and contours of
forgotten and misplaced lore, as in Susan Bee's painting "Masked
Ball."
     I want to contrast the solitary conditions of viewing a work
on a computer screen my posture fixed, my eyes 10 inches from the
image, with the physicality of looking at a painting or sculpture
in a large room, moving around it, checking it out from multiple
views, taking in its tacticle surface, its engagement with my
thoughts.

[Slide #6: Susan Bee, "Help"] & here, a final image from Susan
Bee
-- On the journey of life, lost in cyberspace, where will we find
ourselves: not who we are but who we will be, our virtual

Wonderful to get Charles's electronic piece and it's not too long
at all.  Would that most of my e-mail were as interesting!
The essay is right on!  But depressing as well.  Those images
of the Barbara Streisand home show!.  Is life no more than this?

     Charles Bernstein suggested that I post a description
of my manuscript--a Ph.D. dissertation from SUNY, Buffalo--
on the poetics board, so here it is.  I'm in the process of
looking for a publisher.

     Ran's Notebook and Drawing Book: Speculations by a
Japanese Woman on Cultural Differences  represents my own
experience as a woman, an outsider, and an exile, in a
series of "silent" pictures drawn with a language, a
language embodied in a dancing figure, fluctuating in
meanings.  Ran's book is driven by her desire to retrieve
the the lost story of "Father and Mother" in China, her
hunger for stories of her own--Japan's own--past, and her
need to restore a lost sense of the feminine to herself.
The book traces a development of Ran from a state of being
in "turmoil" to a blooming as an "orchid."  ("Ran" means
both in Japanese).


     What follows is a brief descriptive summary of the
manuscript:

     The first Chapter in Part One, Ran's Notebook, is woven
out of three stories--the ancient Japanese myth of Amaterasu
Ohmikami, the Sun Goddess; a standard history of Japan (from
which accounts of good and powerful women have been
excluded); and the story of Ran, myself.  All of these
represent the re-emergence of femininity.  By interlocking
these texts, I try to show one lives with the history of
one's country and how the story of one's life is inevitably
an embodiment of a national myth.
     The second Chapter in Ran's Notebook deals with the
issue of naming, writing, and the physical nature of
language.  Here I integrate Ran's story with my
interpretation of writing by two well known Asian American
writers, Makine Hong Kingston and Amy Tan.
     Part Two is titled My Drawing Book.  The change of
possessive pronouns reveals a process of self-assertion.  My
intention for inventing Ran, who is named after Orlando, the
character who runs through all of this material up till now,
is to show that personality is not something to be taken for
granted, but a construct which comes into being through the
process of being observed by others and observing oneself.
In My Drawing Book gradually this persona, Ran, is made to
fade and move to one side as the "I" gains confidence to
speak in her own voice.
     The myth of another goddess, Amenouzume, "one who
dances in whirls," is retold with a focus on her dancing
body as a critical site where a feminist re-reading of body
is configurated.  The account of her dance also plays an
important role in my exploration of the kinds of bonds that
can exist among women.  Other accounts drawn from tales of
Amenouzume--her listening to a god's advice, for instance,
or her killing an animal that refuses to speak-- run
parallel to Ran's (my) experience of logophobia in the
English language.
     The shift from writing to drawing in Parts One and Two
shows my transformation from a self nervous about linear and
clear-cut thinking to a self imaginative and creative,
favoring a circular and pictorial representation.  I suggest
this pictorial mode of expression has its roots in a
perception peculiar to the ideographic Japanese language.
     In Part Three, Conversation Piece, I consider the
reason for my father's recourse to a foreign tongue.  It
shows the powerful effect of his silence in that he
communicates not through verbal utterance but through making
others see by means of his actions.  My conclusion is that
my "silent" mode of expression is my father's gift to me,
the path he wanted me to follow.


     What follows is cited from a report of Linda Reinfeld
(author of Language Poetry: Writing as Rescue, Louisiana
State University Press, 1992) who served as the outside
reader of my dissertation:

     The book constitutes a most revealing meditation on
language as a positive agent of transformation in the
experience of a Japanese woman living in the United States.
As she emerges from the persona of "Ran" (meaning "turmoil"
in Japanese) through her own writing, she weaves together
strands of stories from ancient Japanese mythology, Japanese
history, and her own personal experience, including her
experience as a sophisticated reader of such Asian-American
writers as Maxine Hong Kingston and Amy Tan.  In showing how
her own story is an embodiment of a national myth, the
author manages to keep each strand of her narrative distinct
and free of sentimentality, thus achieving a sense of depth
and multiplicity in a feminist construction of self.  The
writing is at all times engaging and imaginative, drawing
much of its strength and scholarly excellence from an
understanding of pictorial, poetic, and ideographic modes of
expression.  "Ran's Notebook and Drawing Book" is a unique
demonstration of what it might mean, right now, to live in
more than one language and more than one time--as sooner or
later, all of us must.


     I'd welcome comments, questions, or advice from the
readers on Poetics.

04/04/94 SARAJEVO POSTCARD

BACK ON TRACK
By Zlatko Dizdarevic

Sometime last summer, when we still used to try to imagine
the day when  everything would finally stop and we could
head south, toward the sea, one of my friends said: "As far
as I'm concerned, I'll know the war is over when the
trolleys start running again and, like in the old days, I
can get on the No. 2 and take it to the end of the line,
right to Villa Cengic. And we can pass all the way across
'Sniper's Avenue,' but no one will be shooting at us."

We laughed then, looking over the twisted tracks, the fallen
power lines, the wrecked and burned-out trolleys. The
trolleys remained exactly where grenade and mortar shells
had stopped them dead in their tracks in May of 1992. It
seemed like everything else--the end of the war, a return to
normal life--would come before the trolleys started running
again. We figured that we'd get to the sea by car, or maybe
even somewhere farther by plane, before we'd be able to make
it to Villa Cengic on the No. 2 red line.

Things turned out differently. The conflict made fools of us
again. When it comes to forecasting war and peace, politics
and life, we have to admit, once more, that we're complete
amateurs. The trolley is running. The tracks have been
straightened out. The power lines have been put up and a few
red cars, in mint condition, have been hauled out from God
knows where. But none of this has anything to do with the
end of the war we had imagined. And it has nothing to do
with what our trip on the No. 2 would have meant. There is
still no peace waiting for us at Villa Cengic.

What stands out most about the No. 2, as it makes its way
through dead neighborhoods, is the route's senselessness.
The trip is nothing more than movement from one place to
another within the same concentration camp, the same prison.
Once upon a time we used to sit in the No. 2 and head down
to Bascarsija, the heart of the Old City of Sarajevo. Today
the area is just a gaping hole, empty and calm. We used to
get on the No. 1 and head for the railroad station and then
go on from there, by train, to other places. Like people.
Now there are no trains; there isn't even a railroad
station. If they start the No. 1 again, what good will it be
if it only serves the same bogus purpose as the No. 2? There
were times when we used to pile into the No. 3 and somehow
make it to Ilidza. And from there we could go wherever our
hearts desired: down the old tree-lined avenue to the source
of the Bosnia River, up to Mt. Igman or even to nowhere in
particular. Thanks to the world's kindness and affection,
Ilidza now belongs to "them"; it is at the other end of the
world, somewhere on another planet. You can't get there, as
everyone well knows, by trolley. A revived No. 3 won't be
able to do us much good either.

The No. 2 is off and running, and everything else stays
still, with very little hope that anything is about to
change. What a blunder it was to think that, one day, a
trolley would take us to freedom. For the rest of the world-
-especially for the politicians and diplomats who try to get
us to accept their lies, who try to get us to tell the world
how happy we are--the resurrected trolley is a triumph. But
what is it to us? How can we even begin to explain that
we've always liked going to Ilidza, the railroad station,
Mostar, the sea? And that we'd much rather go to these
places on foot than have the ability to "freely" roll to
nowhere on a trolley. As the No. 2 stops at every station on
its aborted route across nothing, it creates an illusion
that is equally senseless, revolting and desperate.

Of course, it isn't easy trying to explain this to people
who think that the  only aim in life is to fill your stomach
and your pockets, and that you can be as happy as a cow in
five square meters of living space as long as you   have
your mercy provisions--the gift of a "landlord" or
humanitarian organization. It's also tough to put a damper
on the warm feelings of all those who helped get "Operation
Trolley" underway by sending money, technicians and even
cameramen, just to make sure it was recorded for posterity.
The "international community" also kept its honor intact and
showed its strength, so its leaders have good reason for a
victorious toast over a glass of whiskey. A great nightmare
no longer bears down on them in quite the same way or in
quite the same place. That nightmare hopped onto the red
line, Sarajevo's No. 2, and it's making the rounds now, to
the general contentment of some of the exhausted and
depleted citizens of Sarajevo.

But it's slightly more difficult to sell this story to those
in Sarajevo who  are still using their own heads to think
with, something that, apparently, may constitute this
disobedient city's gravest sin. A few days ago Afan Ramic,
an artist, was talking with some people from Japan who had
come to visit his studio, which is in an abandoned building
that used to be a printing plant. They were a fine bunch,
very serious, dignified and sincere. They listened
carefully, spoke carefully and made offers even more
carefully. For hours they studied the canvases, took
pictures of the works. Then, with great tact and
meticulously chosen words, they conveyed a message to the
painter: their t.v. station, as well as their government,
would be honored if he, the Sarajevan artist Afan Ramic,
would come to Japan with his paintings. There would be
exhibitions, and all expenses would be paid. In short, they
saw no problems except, of course, whether this "extremely
interesting" painter would be willing to accept their
invitation. Would this trip upset any other plans he might
have made? Did he find the concept to his liking? Were there
any special conditions that needed to be met?
"I looked at them for a while without really knowing what to
say. I wasn't really sure, to tell you the truth, whether or
not they were pulling my leg or whether they were serious,"
Afan said later. "I always admired the Japanese for their
seriousness. Could it be that after 700 days of
imprisonment, hunger, personal tragedy and every other kind
of misery imaginable, they were really asking me whether or
not I wanted to go to Japan and have a show? And what's
more, did they have any idea what they were saying when they
claimed that everything would be o.k. as far as traveling
was concerned? Then I decided to ask them what, around here,
always ends up being the most important question: 'That's
all well and good as far as Tokyo and Osaka go; I have no
doubt that it's also nice in Nagoya and Yokohama, but how am
I going to get past the Serb barricades on Ilidza?' I got
the feeling that they felt confused and didn't quite grasp
what I was asking them. I actually began feeling sorry for
them. Then I said, more to myself: `Forget about it, don't
worry, I'll get to Ilidza by trolley.'"

The Japanese went off happy that they had gotten Afan to
come to their country. The painter was left to wait for the
trolley to Ilidza, or some other mode of transportation the
international community could arrange. After all, when you
get past Ilidza and that last barricade, everything is a lot
easier. From there to Japan isn't far at all.

I've read your paper, and wanted to comment particularly on the
notion of "objects obduring" - it reminds me of my use of "obdurate"
in my text; there is also a convergence of idea as well. One reason I
continue to look at and write about painting (for example) is pre-
cisely this inertness which slows down or retards a flow of
information which ultimately becomes a question of manageriality and
"kill" files. A traditional painting is handcrafted; the "signature"
of the body is everywhere present upon it, as is the signifier of
labor. This is an insistence on alterity (I think in the sense of
Levinas) that's extremely important. I get tired of "cyber" and
"surfing" modes which imply a fast skim-and-response to ideas.

I'm sending along a piece I wrote which you may or may not want to
post; it's for you in any case.

THE START OF IT ALL



Back home, I would think about altarity. But now, wandering in a
hermeneutic circle would never square with me...


I'm sitting down to write; I have a reed in my hand, and the sand is
spread out before me. The river in the distance has overflowed its
banks, and is just now receding. There is a banquet nearby; I will go
there shortly, and regale the guests with tales about carpenters and
chariot-makers. In this manner, I will earn my keep. Before going out,
I make sure it is night; even the stars have their master, and
everything is fixed, absolute, and in place forever.

At the banquet, I discourse freely to everyone who will listen. Some
charming dancers entertain the guests, a few of whom are members of
the Resistance. There is fighting right now outside Jena and the
avenues are tense; I can see the imminent victory of the Prussian
state, a natural trajectory of the dialectic, beginning with my
doubting everything, an occasion for eschatological desire. An abyss
opens up beside me; within it, annihilation itself seems to seethe,
and there is no end to the affairs of men and women. The ideal state
to come will have no poets and no philosophers, something I
conclusively demonstrate with all the power of the geometric. Since I
am a misfit, I elevate myself to the top of the mountain where red
flames dominate the landscape; there are those who dominate and those
who are controlled by my subaltern ego. But I reject every pretense,
and wear nothing but a barrel; let those who dare to look, do so.
(Need I add it would be queerer to gaze?)

>From this vantage point, next to a peasant hut in the Black Forest
where men and women are suddenly thrown, I see a red patch,
unidentifiable, but offering every attribute I am considering before
me. The patch is surely the same in all possible worlds, where it
possesses the characteristic of a fact or picture, a rigid designator
articulating the armature of an over-privileged semantics. I may or
may not refer to `it.' If I become the red patch, it is beneath the
sign of capital; capital flows from my pores, flows everywhere. I
dissolve slowly into transparency, a simulacrum of my former self, and
continue to write on a simulacrum-computer, filling all conceivable
data-bases with useless Turing machines; I transform myself into a
body-without-organs in the terminal stages: constipation, corpulence,
power and madness. This is the dreaded `death of the author' signified
in each and every postcard, where letters `go to the drugstore' of the
obsessive-compulsive. The red patch illuminates the desk I am writing
upon, as the final apocalyptic conflagration envisions itself from a
distance. All I can do is raise my fist as Europe shudders, corpse-
like, beneath its sullen masters.

My clenched fist in the air is helpless against the stone I continue
to push up the mountain, which seems slightly absurd, even if
transcendent and rather egotistical. The mathematization of the
granite, rather concrete, results in almost perfect lines of flight
across it; these coalesce with the identical categories available to
the Beaver, who waits for me with Pierre at the cafe shortly after the
symposium has come to an end. No good ever flows from this, the death
of Helene on the way to the final construction of a purified and
scientific political economy, something I can live with, having roamed
the streets of Manchester, in order to bring the philosophical down to
the level of material praxis and avoiding any further reification.
What an imaginary!

The red patch over my eyes is painful; I am hobbled, resorting to the
aphoristic crutch in order to convey my dislike of princes and the
press. The uncanny power of women contaminates every line I add to the
others; it is only through the telephone and its interminable
existential dial-up, that I continue to turn a deaf ear to the world
and its discourse-networks, harboring the unequivocal testimony of
sight. Everywhere, sight leaves its traces; the punctured hymen of the
Beaver provides a final word, projecting from her hole into a freedom
always already structured by its opposite. Double lips shudder,
reducing me to an imaginary penis, uncapped head indicative of the
non-believing Jew exiled from the habitus of the Amsterdam synagogue.
Men always do this, and this is what makes them men. I realize that if
men are analytic, women are synthetic; the Beaver says it's the other
way around. (My statement has never been spoken by a body.)

What makes them men is a purified techne as well, something I would
respond to if questioned. Every question demands an answer, but not
every answer demands a question, which is ineffable, written on this
book of sand that shoots out from under me every twelve or so hours.
But I am of the technological, the episteme of instrumental reason,
not remote or disembodied in an ideal world inhabited by the elements
crowned with the Concept of the Idea. Outside the window there is a
tree of a particular color which the Navajo see; I can never take in
each of its leaves on an individuated basis, just as I can never count
the pillars in the Pantheon. Better, however, is an act of exile which
is reconstruction, always reversible, except for the brute facticity
of death, to which I am hardly partial, being somewhat super. Now I am
gathering speed, becoming incandescent; fragments and seminars course
through my veins close to the speed of light, competing among
themselves, completing the torn fabric of the real (always the
scenario of suture), mumbling through those same veiled lips that
sealed my internal-time consciousness about ten minutes ago.

I am lost in the ipseity of my freedom, confused about beings (there
are so many of them) and Being confused. The eidetic reduction is a
diminution of the obverse; I drink less and less natural kinds as
hypereality transforms null into cipher, leaving me with `a smaller
glass' of tea. The inverse of the glass is neither opaque nor convex;
a node within the grid of doxa cathects every drop spilled from the
fluid mechanics of the feminine. The result? More rigid designators
and more masquerades: the mimetic indeed!

And what is the real if not a game constructed out of the consensual
sublime? What is the sublime if not a differend inverted by silence
(that makes all the differance in the world, being less noisy!)? The
sublime is always silent? Sound is the institutionalization of
capital, the rigidity of the script fixed in a prioritization of the
written over the purely oral and its stages. Each question eliminates
itself; speech is an act of excretion. The cave is silent, too, where
men and women watch. (Speech is always four-fold; no one has time for
that.) In the corner of the cave is perhaps a snake; it may also be a
rod, or rod(ent), whatever is relevant at the moment, whatever might
or might not bite. The id has the face of Medusa, an alterity defining
an essence or existing seeping away, the result of insomnia,
difficulties of health. I write this in the sand until my head is cut
off.

THE STORY OF HORROR WHICH DID NOT HAPPEN TO ME AND IS NOT A STORY



I never had any feeling; ice went up my ass. Everything was dull and
frozen. Packed in without feeling. A grey horizon of light. Iron
spears of pressure-dependent pain. I was immobile. My eyes felt iced
shut. Soaked. The chill is unbearable. I have no number. My blood
freezes as my skin bleeds. Nameless. A rotunda.

They turn me over. Flesh cracks; there's blood something transparent
on the concrete. "On." Teeth are gone. I know my lip is split but I do
not know "I." Oh told to write this you have it.

I am packed frozen between two women. They shove her breast in my
mouth. I can't move. The body stashes its tremble. A convulsion. The
cock grows of its own accord. I bend double. The women pack closer.
One is thrown off and killed. Oh Clara the other one. She places her
mouth on my eye. It moves. I have a tear on my skin. Eye screams with
pain because it is moved.

My cock is hard. Oh Clara holds it, shoves it in. My back collapses
and broken everywhere. It pierces me. Her cunt rings fire. It's of no
use of use. Leans forward, braces. They tear her off me. They tear me
in two. They put her on me. My back breaks in four places. They tear
her off me.

Eye am warmed by ice Oh Clara. Oh Clara your breasts hard against me.
Slab concrete buckles. We fall tight, her cunt sewn on cock, eye sewn
on eye. Sutures everywhere. Leg leg.

Jagged ice everywhere, cut eye. I cannot rise. Oh Clara told to write
this Oh Clara have it Oh Clara you have at it. Blood cracks from her
mouth. She has no mouth, eye has no lid, open Clara cock. You cock I
am dropped. My back breaks, Clara breaks. Cure this; cure this "on." A
last sentence. What can I period. Clara drops. For they drop: drop us.
For they cut: cut us. For they break: break us. Eye am open always.
Sutured shut.

believe," Himmler wrote Rascher, now promoted to SS captain, "these
experiments may bring the best and most sustained results, but of
course I may be mistaken." He was not mistaken. Rascher was able to
report in detail how revived subjects practiced sexual intercourse at
86 to 90 degrees F. and that this proved to be the equivalent of a
"hot bath." When placed between two naked women, the subjects did not
recover as rapidly as with one woman. "I attribute this to the fact
that in warming by means of one woman personal inhibitions are avoided
and the woman clings very closely to the chilled person (cf. Curve
4).' From the blurb inside front cover: `THIS WAS *HELL* ON EARTH /
They: *Injected innocent people with disease germs for the greater
glory of German ... Made lamp shades from human skin ... Revived
frozen men by the use of naked women ... Utilized the body fats of
millions for the German war effort ... Put to death more people than
any other tyranny in the history of the world ...*'

Subject:      Summer Reading

so to get my head back into a _place_
I'm looking to read by decent means
some decent poems
and decent poets
I haven't read before

whatever decent means

I figure that if I list one or two that
I like but you may not know about
why then, maybe you'll send me
some names living or dead
and titles (likewise I'm sure)

So try
"The Weekend of Dermot and Grace"
by Eugene R. Watters. _Poetry-Ireland_Review_
13 (Spring 1985): 25-71
first published Dublin: Allen Figgis & Co 1964 --
surely there's a copy in Fubbalo

and if you see any of his work around
in recent magazines
(try Peter Riley's Poetical Histories
or Harry Gilonis' Form Books --
Gilonis also publishes Catherine Walsh
Colin Simms and I think Wendy Mulford)
get hold of Maurice Scully
also Irish. Pig Press is bringing
out a new Scully book soon, called
_Basic_Colours_


But if you want some wonderful well call it prose
steal borrow beg or even buy
Rob Kovitz
_Pig_City_Model_Farm_
Toronto
Treyf
1992
(dist in USA by Princeton Arhitectural Press)
a brilliant collage attack on just about
anything to do with the rule of, well, rule --
and even (shudder) community.


What a blessed relief it is that NONE of these books
is flavoured with          Parfum du Professorat
or even                    Sachet d'eleve
though they are not by that guaranteed to be wholesome.

And if you've got this far through this list
there's a BONUS QUOTE as reward and punishment:
Laura's mother in Lola Lemire Tostevin's
new novel _Frog_Moon_
(Dunvegan, Ontario
Cormorant Books
1994)
asks and answers
"Do you know what the actress said
to the bishop who was wearing a surplice
and swinging his incense vessel?
Love your dress, darling,
but your purse is on fire."

Central Park Grill, 2519 Main Street, Buffalo, NY (USA)

We are working to bring these events on-line in interactive
formats not yet devised.  The Poetics Technical Crew
is having particular trouble bringing into the model
the free wings (with blue cheese dressing) generously
provided by the bar after each reading.  But we pledge
not to go on the World Wide Web with this type of, as they
say on TV, "live" programming until we attend to details
such as these.

        If I had the wings
        of a chicken
        to the great CPG
        I would fly

        and sit right up front there
        and listen
        to all that great shit
        flying by...


You all come, folks.
Listen to your Uncle Charlie!

You hear?

                ........

        OH

        You can't get hear from there, man,
        You can't get hair from a chair, man.
