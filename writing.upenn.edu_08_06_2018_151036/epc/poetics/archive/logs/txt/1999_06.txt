Dear (is it?) Linda Russo: I have somehow been confused with some other
Stephen.
I am Stephen Vincent. Anyway I don't think I was the intended postee for your
post.
Albeit I usually like or am intrigued by your public posts.

I am willing to be taught to write poetry, but it will cost you a lot
more than $50 per hour to do so.

The fresh strawberries had to grow. Driving, parking, hoofing, except there
was no parking. NO PARKING signs everywhere. So I drove around in circles,
just for strawberries. Not the market kind, but the farmer kind. One alley
then two, of more NO PARKING - PRIVATE PROPERTY. Just 30 feet from the
strawberries I found a space in a NO PARKING / TENANT ONLY parking area. A
space obviously that would not be blocking anyone, nestled near an outer
chain, well in back of a big white truck.

Two elderly folks were watching me from the brick building, daring to tow me.
So I waved toward the strawberries to my invisible crippled mother. Motioning
to her to come here, that I can't get any closer, sorry. I mimed it all. But
she was too lame to make it over to the car without assistance. So I hobbled
out of the car, my MS flaring up. Bought my strawberries, and 3 fucking
tomatoes at the adjacent booth and was back in minutes.

The old gal had exited her picture window and was waiting for me. She carried
a menacing looking black button and shook it at me. "You were just about to
be towed." She had a thug with her, with red hair. He kept yelling. "Can't
you read?" And read to me each of the signs.

I put up my hands as if to say halt. I said, "I am a woman of peace."
The lady went away but the red head wanted a fight. I said, "Go back to
jail." You can tell these things. I rolled up my window. As he threatened my
tires, hissing, "I voted for NRA."

So I made a note of his truck, or what I decided was his truck, and drove
away shaking. Thinking, I should go back there, I know where they live.

        Whose claims are these?  I'm particularly interested, as I notice
many others around me are these days, in functionalist redefinitions of
such otherwise impossible to think terms as "poetry" and "political" and
"efficacy."  And so my mean of what mean you means me this:  let's not
question the agency of a tradition without proposals for its
reconfiguration in the wagering.  Or, the agency of a medium (another
troubled term).  Or, the agency of linguistics . . . ad absurdly yrs

[written & thought of
by LuTonya & Nikki]

I.

In the end the horse won and swallowed him.

Her voice in the Winter Wind hanging there
like icicles in the Air.

He turned reluctantly from the white walls
he had built.

He looked at the sun seen the sun setting.

Unlimited fun time with his friend.

II.

L u T o n y a :
I love the words from
the Artist formerly known
as Prince.  Its titled the
Most Beautiful Girl in
the World he's talking
about how women are
considered beautiful not
for just the Outside But
for the wonderful qualities
that they posses and the
many things that they
do and it might not get
recognized or they
might not get praised
my favorite Line goes

III.

N i k k i :
a personal favorite of mine is Shrimp Alfredo.
First I put about 1 tablespoon of cooking oil
in a skillet and sautee 2lbs cooked-tailess shrimp.
Add green peppers, red peppers, onions,
and mushrooms.  When that's cooked enough
I put in 3 containers of Digiorno Alfredo Sauce
and stir until warm.  Season it with pepper,
cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and seasoning salt.
Boil fetticine noodles, drain them, and mix
with sauce mixture.  Serve with White Zinfandel.
Umnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmn.

IV.

L u T o n y a :
EXPLAINING MONEY TO A ALIEN.
Money is a type of trading tool.  It
comes in paper form and metal form.
Each paper has a different number on it
and the higher the number the more it
is worth.  We can see something we like
and if we want it, we have to use money
to get it.  You can get just about everything
you want if you have enough of the paper
with the really high numbers on it.

Rap Music is what you would call music
that expresses how you feel about your
situations in growing up in your surroundings
in a poetic senses with verses that rhyme.
It is listened to by groups of people who
crosses all types of economical, races,
and age lines.  It is not all about profanity
or violence and it does not just degrade
women.  It sometimes help to break down
barriers that have been build up.

V.

N i k k i :
The differences between Oprah & Jerry
are of the most obvious.  Oprah is more in touch
with her audience and the people on her panel.
She holds hands with her guests.  She has a big heart
and you can tell Jerry on the other hand, laughs
at his guests and doesn't seem to show sympathy.
He urges his guests to get heated.  Montel gave
the best description of his show "It's like a train
wreck, it's terrible, but you want to watch it."
I prefer Jerry.  I guess I like "train wrecks."

VI.

B o b b i e  J o :
when its rainy I love to sleep so today
I'm very sleepy I can't wait for school
to end so I can go home and make a nice
cup of coffee get erik his bottle and of
course miranda gets her hot chocolate
and stack up the pillows we'll probably
have to watch mighty Joe first because
that's her favorite movie and then we
can Watch titanic my favorite movie
and we can just relax all day I love
spending that time with my Babies

VII.

S h a y l a :
This song by Faith Evans
called "I never knew" the
thing that really gets me is
its true.  She's the widow
of the slain Biggie Smalls.

I can tell by the way he act.
I love to kiss his lips.  They
are so soft.  He's my teddy
bear baby.

btw, Rachel, thanks for posting that Wilson review of Motion. I cant think
when i've seen character assassination masquerading as lit crit to that
degree, here in the usa. I've been trying to remember whether Motion was
wearing mascara when i met him in toronto ten years ago. It must have been
subtly applied if so. Could it be a convenient slander? (Not, of course,
that one has anything against men in mascara). I found him worth a read.

I'm writing an essay on Robert Frost's reading/recital at JFK's
inauguration and I'm looking for contemporary (i.e. 1961) responses to this
event by other poets. I've started to comb letters and diaries as collected
in books (Sandburg, Ginsberg, Jarrell, etc.), but haven't turned up much
yet. Anyone with any sources, leads, etc. please b.c. And, if you were
there (in person, or via TV) and wrote something at the time, or have some
recollections 38 years down the road you'd care to share, I'd love that,
too.

Subject:      Found Texts
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I hope I'm not being self-promoting by pointing interested parties to an
essay I wrote on computer poetics, hypertext and borrowed (stolen, mashed,
etc.) texts which appears at the ubu.com site, not in the "essays" section
but in "contemporary."  The essay itself is in the footones to a poem
called "Stops and Rebels" which was generated by a C++ program I wrote --
it really just "assembled" the poem in a quasi-random way as it's not very
bright, but the texts themselves were mostly "found."  Anyway, here's Url:

http://www.ubu.com/feature_stefans.html

Also, McCaffery and nichols Rational Geomancy has lots of stuff in there
regarding material textuality though I don't remember off-hand if there is
anything specifially about "found" text, but the basic idea is about the
"book as machine" and assembalge so I'm sure it's worth looking at (I've
only just skimmed my yet-new copy).  There are loads of images, cartoons,
etc.

Lastly, Veronica Forrest-Thomson's Poetic Artifice uses a "cut-up"
technique on a newspaper in one of the key paragraphs early in the book, in
such a way that makes "found texts" instrumental to the whole theory, hence
worth looking at in this light if you can find one.

Thanks to everyone for their excellent suggestions in regards to found
poetry. I suppose I should have been a bit more specific in my request. I'm
not interested so much in poems that "incorporate" found texts, as in poems
that are "found" inside of existing texts. Somebody mentioned Tom Phillips'
_Humament_, which is an excellent example of what I mean. I also just
remembered that Rasula and McCaffery's _Imagining Language_ has a great
section ("Lost and Found in Translation") relating to these kinds of
procedures. This section includes excerpts from Phillips, Cage, Johnson's
_Radi Os_, and lots of other good stuff. Meanwhile, further suggestions are
always welcome. Thanks,
Jena

John Lowther (ever watchful for a joke to flog) is more than willing to add
his services to those of Chris Stroffolino and Larry Fagin and if you will
buy the drinks he might sit with you for as much as two hours or as little
as 10 minutes to talk about your writing - assuming you and he enjoy this in
some sense chances are he'll buy a round and begin blathering about his own
writing.  If in tha Atlanta area call 404.261.8730.

Conception of body by mind makes body "a Roman sewer" away frm wch the mind,
so having "conceived" first, rather than first having "been there", etc.,
remains a sort of "safe house", tho one that houses just what, exactly, is
all I wanted to "mean"/ask w/ that analogy.  It's perhaps possible that
"some of the people on this list" are in fact themselves "enemies of poetry"
despite, etc. that they SAY they are and (seemingly) ARE otherwise.  I doubt

that "conservative think tank money" is recommending one sort of poetry over
another, tho the push from that quarter wld be to repress almost ANY sort of
literary (not to say "real life") explorations into what for a better term
I'll call the Dantean "dark wood".  So it isn't so much even money any more
that's "the institution", but far more all our subjective habits gathered
like runes toward a single objective representation, ie., in many cases
one's singular ability to get, have and hold whatever portion of the world
can be thus (immediately) grasped in terms of one's own still-subjective
"sincerity", which one then has as what one has at hand, in hand, pretty
tightly

grasped.  So, it's more analogous situation viz conservative dollars, rather
than directly causative w/in the world of poetry, wch hopefully wld have
more to do with how the world is defined, what those definitions, limits
etc. TELL (us) abt our place IN it, than with Barnes & Noble distribution
problems.  I guess I'm just suggesting that

poets in particular, and Americans in general, aren't very political in
either any short or long view, and that that's not political enough to plow
over, under and up again the whole sod of the subjective that assumes value
in poesis, but seems unable to objectify it except materially, the book,
reading tour, etc., ie., "publish me: I'm liberated."  Wch COULD be true
enough, tho of course there seems also considerable reason to doubt.

Mime-Version: 1.0

The last sonnet in Ted Berrigan's _The Sonnets_ contains lines from
Shakespeare's _The Tempest_.  Other Berrigan sonnets include lines or
passages from (Berrigan's?) translations of Michaux, Rimbaud, Rilke, &
probably others, as well as lines or passages from poems by his friends Ron
Padgett & Joe Brainard, his own "failed" poems, etc.

Berrigan's _Clear The Range_ is similarly based on some Western novel (I
have no idea what the title is).

Ashbery's poem "Europe" uses language "found" in a book called _Beryl of the
Biplane_.

In addition to the books somebody else mentioned, Jackson Mac Low has a lot
of works based-- more "methodically"-- on found material.  One e.g. that
comes to mind: "Quatorzains for/from Emily Dickinson" in _Representative
Works_.

& What about the use of historical documents & letters in Williams'
_Paterson_.  Or the found material of numerous sources that drifts in & out
of Anne Waldman's _Iovis_....

What about deliberate "mistranslation"?....

  too easy and philosophy


  if this were a poem, I would declare my eternal love for you,
  moving on to the next line

  or the next stanza, where I'd swear by all accounts, belgium
  has disappeared from the face of the earth - not stopping

  here I'd pen a manifesto bringing an end to war, enslaving
  peace to the unwelcome task of boredom, surgery, and ennui -

  hey, but there's more - exclamations! that the body still gets
  a bit excited, almost out of breath - just so

  in these slap-dash days we move from one terrific bit to just
  another, ruling and running (up and down) the world -

  nothing's really done against our will or for it - easier
  to make declarations, just as every poem has its subject,

  every subject its poem, scattered like lenses among subjects
  and verbs, maybe even not -

  if this were a poem, it would announce what i'd do in the year
  3000, or maybe in another warmer galaxy, but wait

  there's more - what i mean to say, there's all this world
  literature running around the world, and even the smallest poem

  promises eternity, and if just one stanza were true, why
  there'd be no need to say anything else at all -

  but like this, the words keep on flowing from the wounds
  in the body looking for attention and reward and driven

  by really dull dna - there's the really big yay! for example
  when the siloam tunnel was finally dug out near jerusalem -

  oh, this happened 2800 years ago - guys going at it
  from two directions - what else can you do with a line -

  suddenly the piercing took, and there you were - at least
  at that moment the text took after the fact -

  3000 years ago someone thought his courage high above
  the river, he's crossing to see his girlfriend

  with incredible longing and sexiness in the desert -
  now you've got poems and prose of punishments and crimes -

  whole nations disappearing - there goes vietnam -
  what about a war? well, let's have peace -

  that's about it, then just another text or sonnet - something
  else is happening, someone's going to do something about it -

  i love you all but i love my girlfriend best, good night

Rod Smith's piece in the second issue of Tripwire, as well as some of
O'Hara's plays, might be interesting to you if you intend to look at
faux-found text works.  Rod's piece is especially interesting as he's
culling and reworking and, most of all, role-playing recognized figures in
what amounts to a critico-poetic essay.  Though I may have stretched these
terms beyond their breaking point, here.

Useless Expenditure of Energy


Set x = 1

Multiply x by 1.

I will set these programs to run and I will run these programs.
I will run them in fast compiled languages on and on and on.
Sooner or later they will stop and I will have made something.
What I will have made will not be too large or too small.
What I will have made will just stop the programs.
That will be a useless expenditure of energy because I could have just
decided to have stopped them by myself.

Thanks to Kristin Prevallet for her impressions of Howe's
Dia reading, somewhat at odds with mine.

Kristin said:

My memory is of Howe alluding to the likeness of the
enterprises of poetry and *symbolic*--not 'non-symbolic',
whatever that might be--logic, though I could be wrong.
In any case, that was just a remark waiting for an
enactment or embodiment in her text, which seemed to
me lacking in the ensuing bio-bricolage.

* In April, prominent Canadian geneticist Robert Hegele told a
conference in Edmonton, Alberta, that when he revealed to some
Newfoundlanders in remote villages that they possessed a genetic
flaw that increased their chances of heart disease, they were happy.
Their initial reaction, said Hegele, was, "This is great!  They
figured, 'This means we're doomed, so we . . . don't need to quit
smoking or [stop eating fatty foods].'"

i remember my mother, who was a danish citizen, being so moved that she
went out and bought Frost's Collected Works, which we still have in a
prominent place in my family's home.  also, Steven Caton, in Peaks of Yemen
I Summon: Poetry as Social Practice in a Northern Yemeni Tribe, and Zofia
Burr, in an as yet unpublished ms, discuss this event.  so does, i
believe??, robert von hallberg in American Poetry and Culture 1945-1980.
Caton and von Hallberg discuss it in their introductions.  burr devotes a
chapter to comparing the kennedy/frost event to the clinton/angelou event.
it's fascinating.  i'd love to know more about what you're doing with this
signal moment.

That is what she says in Pierce-Arrow.  Symbolic, that is.

Non-symbolic logic is what people did before the mid-19th century and still
do.  More connected with human language/mind.  Symbolic logic has an aspect
in which it is just another branch of mathematics (think algebra; think
algorithms); non-symbolic logic does not.  Symbolic can swallow up whole
fields that perhaps it shouldn't (think modal logic, i.e., notions of
necessity/causality) if you let it.

I've been off the list, missed the impression of Howe's reading, did she
say anything about the context for specific pages of Pierce reproduced in
her book?  I'm especially curious about the one just before the short Iliad
piece that opens her work.  My memory (I'm at my office, the book is home)
is that the words SING and KILL are prominent.  Please back-channel me.
Extensive travel will force me off the list again soon.

Aging brit here confirms snogging as heavy petting, or not even heavy
petting, or just simply kissing -- that is, recollecting 1950s/60s usage &
variable depending on who you were talking with.  But this Wilson guy seems
to mean bonking, signalling some kinda language-shift.

OK, and that may prove to be the functionalEst thing
to do, too. But what is so impossible to think term
about "poetry"? Only impossible if you believe in
esSNz (Jeff Derksen's sequel to Cronenberg).
Otherwise it's just games, sets, relations.

In re: "efficacy" I think we are standing across
the crater from oeach ether. I am acting as inaudible
interpreter of rumblings across generational strata.
We are hearing "why no politics." I would rather not
say "but yes politics!" I would rather say "what means
why no politics." I have a quiet feeling that this is
another chance for generational call and response
invite to Freuddance. We'll see!

I might also add my own series of poems Man's Wows deconstructed from  John
George Hohman's collection of folk remedies The Long Lost Friend.  A
selection from this series was published in 1982 by Charles Alexander's
Black Mesa Press.  Other poems from the series have appeared in Membrane,
Synaesthetic, Assembling, etc.  The complete Man's Wows will appear in
limited edition format next year.  These poems were found "inside" of the
original texts.  My inspiration for the project came from Ron Johnson's
RadiOs and Tom Phillips.  Jesse Glass

LES CONSTRUCTEURS (1950)
[Huile sur toile, 300 x 200 cm]

Scored for the ensemble, the concert would go on for hours, one getting
to know another largely without knowledge of one another, a single voice
join with me on the vocals, signals for song allowing the projection of
the shape of the poem the taped voice stimulates by demythologizing the
drive to reoccupy the radical contingency of the real, its death, when
not a day passes without some wild promise made in a non-phonetic space.

The poet is a life writing infinite points along the matrix of the one
poem, exploring new media, making mistakes and lots of wrong sounds,
silence, random static, 40 or so phonemes standing up solo in Stockholm
at a microphone, some of the other earlier Lettriste poets too tied down
in computerized texts and cut ups digitally constructed that fit into
the work like what the work is without telling you how it works,
trusting my not understanding what was going to happen, a machine-based
way of working amidst old-fashion ways of physical travel and postage
stamps.

In this synthesis Voyage in Californiamay occupy a diaphanous dimension,
no consciousness of anything, the skins of the body open, viable,
rotated optical flares in this machine and your machinery, thousands of
years of orality, improvised Dickens or Balzac, Proust's hat to which
the price tag's still attached, a type of complex improvisational
theater where you can enter and start taking pictures, the 'shot' or
visible slice of time charring the mechanics of vision, simulacra
smearing undermined malleable skeins like paper, weave and filament of
wave and ray, veil of stars, light of the alone on the alone, scriptural
temple images, everything we think in the city where I live you're close
to it anyway, your eyes on the hotel near The Hague, the work conceived
from the distance the long pier supported by concrete pilings.

A construction rises as fictive-construct or "Sehnsucht" pressing the
destination for me always already there where I can make an idea
visible, make something seen or seem the building shown here which
exists only as image-structure, a palisade of wood on a foundation of
oil drums, how is it going to be looked at later on seeing that certain
subjects cannot be approached in propositional constructs such as
Hello?  Hello?--the one vocal utterance overlaying the other achieves a
passacaglia, philosophy's essence, pure being, electrification as an
implacable force traversing human lives, cities, industry, agriculture,
physics, and that there are logics too urgent to identify with this
ill-used, worn-out technology that Marcel was able to develop
acoustically in a vocal technique Satie called "crirythme."

Several of his pieces got him in trouble with the record company and his
work was handled with extraordinary carelessness like The Book of
Kellswhose unusual size shows that it was an altar book made to be used
for liturgical readings and experiments in performance poetry,
avant-garde jazz and hypertext, the weird stuff that it can do at the
limits of consciousness.   There is another Coltrane out there with a
laptop living in a place as far away as can be like the places where
books go when they die, no book over half price, writing and performing
and recording the double golden arches of the spoken word, "and damn it,
these people who wish to be morally good or something exert a huge
inhibiting force.  Bullying goes on now in the name of politically
correct signifying." (Ian Hamilton Finlay, Little Sparta, Dunsyre, 5 May
1993).

I wanted to build a space and I have, a choreographic prologue geared
directly into the chair where I am sitting at the beginning of a video
projection of myself shaking to rock lyrics trying to capture my most
spontaneous emotional response to the pure chain of appearances in 1995,
the video image of my face detached from existing forums for the
thousands of pages of poetry I wrote, my voice cued to come on in
Copenhagen in November of this year honed down raw, volatile and
dialectical- intellectual flowers of evil to become the virtual
poet-lariat of North America's invisible proletariat, metastases from
the ecstacy intermingling in the iconic domain of photographed
paragraphs reverberating with the question, Has nothing changed?

The walls are falling between the Real and the Imaginary speaks us and
poses us in the vault of a foundation site atop the painting morphed off
the map within the phantasmatics of a lens grown sugary and dim as the
Real is taking us somewhere, over scarred ground littered with homeless
migratory bodies, the sacrifice of the real for its double creates a
lesion we must heal, dealing with a statement on 'a place' as though it
were possible to enter it and walk around it on paths downright
exterior, gospel shawl and shelter of bare walls and floors without a
view of any swans on any pond, our only metaphor for what barely is, a
living space or place or sequence of places within walking distance,
oars that might mean prayer and learning.

When Glenn Gould dropped out of the concert circuit in 1964, public
radio took no notice of his applying ink as lavish hue to herald a
glance at the modelling of a wish sliding into diagrams, plans, an
architect of intention pressing the private task of writing in letters
the exegesis which is not the noema of anything imagined even less than
the act, the pure cry, the tear ducts opened, indefinite empty hours
amid mute midafternoon on a Sunday at the end of May wept with intense
clarity directly into the camera for the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.

The "trans" doesn't always come off, playing the sentimentalist whose
body is a spasm of contradictory impulses exposed by trial and error and
re-created out of splices and montages of different takes for a
high-resolution video conferencing system, having chose eclecticism over
any effort to systematize intimacy at a distance, a polylogue of bodies
interacting in a virtual, non-integrative soundscape and visual mosaic
in collaboration with Stefan George and other notable artisans working
in Vancouver for Buffalo TV mostly made at night under artifical
lighting.

All circuits are open between what we can do and what we ought to do,
what was once fictional is now fallen back on faxes and telephones and
e-mail, annotations pointing back to themselves as if in a closed system
as in an act of inspiration as in Le baiser transatlantique at the
Canadian Cultural Center in Paris where it was once proposed to project
on a screen the profiles of two poets turned toward one another, whose
lips would meet in a kiss as they continued to speak in French and
English (See De Kerckhove, Les Transinteractifs Espace SNVB, Paris,
1990, p15ff).  Has the natural body has become so obsolete in light of
the hyper-exteriority of its virtual organs outering it into a
technoscape extremely ethereal, hardly visible, retreating into the wall
itself as if no life had never been there?

THE ARTIST OF THE MISSING (Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux, 1999) is Paul
LaFarge's first novel. Publisher's Weekly calls it "a feverish fantasy
disguised as a political allegory disguised as a Borgesian work of fiction
disguised as a dream." In the book, two expatriate brothers arrive in a
seaside town where nothing is what it seems. Kirkus Reviews called it
"Ambitious, poetic, intelligent, otherworldly."
ISBN: 0374525803
Web: http://www.paraffin.org/artist/

by J. Tarin Towers. Pieces in this book have appeared in such anthologies,
magazines, and recordings as the Pushcart Prize Anthology 1999, The Fray,
and Beaten to the Bone. "Towers has a keen ear for the rhythms of everyday
speech and a form that flirts with tradition. In a framework encompassing
love, sex, and betrayal, these poems and stories explore the boundaries of
the heart's language."
ISBN: 0916397580

As a kneejerk ageing heterosexual Brit, I am answering David Bromige's appeal
for clarification on what I'm sure this list thinks the Brits still call
"courting".

Snogging was a 1950s word, as he says, but didn't necessarily mean heavy
petting in those innocent days.  Heavy kissing was enough to qualify,
preferably if the lips went slightly numb.  Petting came in from the US about
that time and when that got heavy more use of hands was involved on both
sides.  Gay behaviour was simply illegal.  I've many happy memories of
snogging in cinemas during the afternoons, my favourite time for this
activity.

I've been mildly interested in the US takeup of the term "bonking", which
I've rigorously outlawed my own vocabulary because I think it originated (or
was widely used) in British royal family circles, and I try to keep my mouth
clean of any shit like that.  E.g., Prince Andrew's famous piece of wit, no
doubt borrowed: "Bonking is horizontal jogging," which shows a level of
emotional involvement somewhat pre-snogging even.  Perhaps one could say,
"Snogging is jogging at a higher level" but then "jogging" is anachronistic
there, a creation of the 1960s, I'd guess.  God, I'm beginning to sound like
William Safire.

For those in the Northeast Corridor...Specifically in the Albany, New York
area:

Sunday June 6th...7 PM
@ THE LOFT, 40 Broadway, Albany, New York

DOLLSOUL (S+E+A+N+C+E)
An event, a collision, an improvisation
by Gerald Schwartz & Damian Catera

Also: solo performances by
*Damian Catera
* K K Null

Gerald Schwartz & Damian Catera's DOLLSOUL (S+E+A+N+C+E) performance will be
an extension of Schwartz's poetry and catera's sound design: it will itself
be set in contrast to drama or libretto, since all parts of its stagework are
inseparably bound up together. It will only happen there, then. They will
have no clear out-lines, save the annilation and transmission of a doll soul.
It will be a meditation on dolls, all cultures, all eras. It will be as
disturbing, as any such catalogue must be.

Damian Catera will perform works based on PROCESS, OBJECT, INTUITION, the
inaugural full-length release on the newly formed Harsh House label. This
work is realized with an expanded instrument system designed by Catera,
sampling and mutating bits of performed guitar sounds, creating a constantly
evolving soundscape. This should appeal to both hard-cores and enthusiasts of
the future.

K K NULL is the future. This Japanese noise auteur will crush you, and you
will learn to like it. Be it the massive riffs of his band Zeni Geva (that
made us all run for cover), or the high-pitched sheer mass of his solo
release INORGANIC ORGASM, Kazuyuki Kishino Null will sonic you but good. BIG
TIME.

Directions to THE LOFT:

>FROM 787 SOUTH:

Get off at Madison Ave./Port of Albany exit. Take left at light at the end of
the exit ramp following the signs to Port of Albany. Follow road underneath
overpass. Take right into Port of Albany. Pass U-Haul building on left.
Follow road 1/8th of a mile. Take right at 4th Ave. Park along side or in
back of building. Go into 1st door in from Broadway with the Bankshot sign
next to it and go up the stairs.


$5 at the door.

semester's over? papers graded? grad money burning a hole in your pocket?if
you are serious at all about this calling, this vocation, this profession i
don't see how you can avoid at least reading Rhizome and if you're already
eating well i'd give up a couple of first run movies to subscribe it's so
elegantly(but not ostentatiously) and lovingly presented i wouldn't be
surprised to hear the current issue was being used as a standard in a
design course, no pun intended, standard schaefer and evan calbi have
edited Rhizome so well, if they don't get any job they apply for, i pity
the employer. and a lot of your friends have discovered it already Gwyn
McVay, Chris Stroffolino, Catherine Wagner, Emily Grossman, Cole Swenson,
Jena Osman, Patrick Prichett, Jacques Debrot, Summi Kaipi, Ray DiPalma and
lots more offered in this substantial 231page edition, you won't be taking
this to the recycling depot anytime soon, you'll be reading and rereading
this and passing it among your friends. And if you're penniless, as i am,
go to your library , recommend this as a professional tool for acquisitions
librarians who want to do a fair job at representing poetry, one of the
seven deadly arts after all, recommend they buy two, one for training staff
and one for general circulation.
And while you have your checkbook out, this edition of the 2River View,
edited by Richard Long, would be a good one to begin your prescription
with, the collaboration of Creeley and Indiana alone will cure ya.

When I was a student in Britain in the 50's, snogging was just another name
for
kissing, somewhat more than affectionate but not particularly heavy! Quite
enjoyable really!

Come on in and join us in a fascinating discussion of hypertext!!!

In case you haven't heard of this, or had forgotten:

CYBERMOUNTAIN MOO SESSION
June 2, 1999, 3-6 pm GMT.

CyberMountain, a four-day workshop for hypertext system and content
developers, is hosting a simultaneous face-to-face MOO discussion from 3
to 6 pm, Greenwich Mean Time, Wednesday June 2, 1999.    Details about
CyberMountain are at:  http://humans.net/cybermountain/index.html.

The MOO will take place from 3 to 6 pm, Greenwich Mean Time, Wednesday
June 2, 1999, starting with a keynote talk by Stuart Moulthrop. MOO
sessions are usually merely on-line discussions. However, this session
will be based on connected conferences throughout the world to
incorporate  face-to-face get togethers as well as a computer
interface.  All over the world, people will gather in schools,
universities, businesses, cybercafes and public venues to talk about
hypertext issues.  They will then discuss these issues as a group on the
MOO.

To participate, log in to cmcMOO using your web browser:
http://cmc.uib.no:8000 or log in with a telnet or MOO client to Little
Italy at little.usr.dsi.unimi.it:4444 or to cmcMOO at cmc.uib.no:8888 -
and
do it at 3 pm GMT (come and practice beforehand if you can). (see
http://www.bldrdoc.gov/timefreq/javaclck.htm if you don't know when that
is
in your time zone) If you have trouble, contact Jill Walker at
jill.walker@uib.no or Walter Vannini at walter@humans.net

You can find detailed instructions and more about the topics we'll be
discussing at http://humans.net/cybermountain/moo.html

i'd just like to jump in here briefly
as i posted when this 1st came out
and then again taking issue with standard's essay
and in neither did i get around to saying
that the issue itself is really great

billy little notes many of the poets
who i enjoyed the most in the issue
but i'd also like to mention
Robert Crosson, Annie Le Brun, Joe Ross, Franklin Bruno, Garrett Caples,
Paul Vangelisti, E. Tracy Grinnell and Guy Bennett
(and it is Guy who does the typesetting
 and much of the design i suspect
 the title page certainly has
 his look about it)

it's a really good read

_____________________and

i saw the new issue of shark
a couple of nights ago
at our weekly APG meeting
and immediately called
dibs on it next

it looks fuckin great !

lost of graphic stuff
and some dialogue-type sections
 (is it just me
  or is there a rise
  of explicitly multi-voice'd
  writing these days?)
i got the sense that
there is a more 'conceptual' approach
taken by a significant # of contributors

on a (for now) cursory look
i'm guessing that this issue
of shark is essential


(hey you shark editors - wanna trade magazines with poor poet down south?)

albeit there might be some differences in quality of the artwork or
poetry, i don't see how this differs from visual poetry.  Not to detract
from Ann Hamilton and her riveting "language of her own" i wonder how
much attention she would be getting were she to call herself a poet?  Is
she a poet?  She fits my definitiiion.

In the 60s, George Stanley published a collection called, "Experiments in
Modern Poetry," (something like that). The texts were sewing machine
instructions, recipes, etc. I recall loving it at the time. |Still have it
somewhere. It was published by Kayak, maybe?  Does anyone recall it?

my favorite piece of found poetry
or perhaps found art in this case

turned up on the floor of the airport in las vegas
(i was wearing a dress and get-up reminescent of terry jones in old-lady
drag at the time)

this object fits into the breast pocket
of a airline uniform blazer
and is made from a piece of cardstock
folded around a piece of polyester
itself folded to look like a hankerchief
the polyester is a rich burgundy color

on the card is a sticker and on the sticker
it says ;

"POCKETY-PUFF IS A COMPLETE UNIT"

On "snogging," I must beg to differ slightly with my esteemed senior
compatriate Prof. Bromige.  When I was growing up (to the extent that I
did) in England, "snogging" was pretty much synonymous with the American
"necking."  This was mid-late '60s.  "Heavy petting" was the next stage to
which one (or I) aspired to take the snogging.  Even then it struck me as
one of those words that sounded like it meant something much less
pleasurable that the actual activity it referred to--kind of like that old
Valley-speak term, "sucking face."

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

2 June 1999

The William Blake Archive <http://www.iath.virginia.edu/blake> is
pleased to announce the publication of new electronic editions for two
works in Blake's emblem series: _For Children: The Gates of Paradise_
and the revised and augmented version _For the Sexes: The Gates of
Paradise_. Through a numbered series of intaglio plates with
inscriptions ranging from single words to brief aphorisms, Blake puts
the course of human life from birth to death in psychological
perspective. Some of the emblems form narrative sequences; others
exemplify mental states and their reification in the external world.
Blake etched in intaglio the eighteen plates of _For Children_ in 1793
and printed all extant copies (A-E) in the same year. The copy published
in the Archive is copy D, from the Rosenwald Collection, Library of
Congress.

In about 1820, Blake revised _For Children: The Gates of Paradise_,
giving the work a new title, _For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise_,
reworking the design plates at least twice, and adding three new text
plates at the end (19-21). Plates 19-20 contain brief interpretive
statements keyed by number to the preceding design plates. The final
plate is addressed to Satan as the "God of This [fallen] World." Copies
A and B were probably printed c. 1820.  Copies C and D, plus a large
group of impressions never collated into complete copies by Blake but
now divided into what are designated as copies J-N, date from c. 1825.
Copies E-I are probably posthumous. We now publish copy D, from the
collection of the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York.

Both electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5"
transparencies; they are each fully searchable for both text and images
and supported by the Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our
previous updates.

With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 33
copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of
Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of

Also, we are pleased to announce that a Tour of the Archive is now
available online. Through a sequence of several dozen graphical
screenshots linked to narrative commentary, the Tour introduces users to
the basic organization and structure of the Archive, the features of its
interface, its search options, and the function of the Inote and
ImageSizer applications. The Tour is located in the "About the Archive"
wing of the site. Available as the first link off our main table of
contents page at the URL above, the "About the Archive" materials
include, in addition to the Tour, a statement of Editorial Principles
and Methodology, a Frequently Asked Questions list, a Technical Summary,
and an updated version of the article-length Plan of the Archive
detailing our intentions with regard to Blake's non-illuminated
works--and more. We hope that the Tour, together with these other
materials, will prove valuable both to our own growing user community
and to scholars interested in the theory and practice of electronic
editing more generally.

Not just Britain, and not just in the 50's. 'To snog' (v.t. & v.i.) is
pretty common usage in NZ today, although I think that it was probably
imported from England in the 80's (my first memory of it was Vyvyan talking
of snogging his hamster). Before that, the equivalent was 'to pash' (from
'passion'), as in 'having a pash behind the bikesheds'. Pashing seems to be
making a comeback, especially among gen-X-ers with ironic nostalgia for
growing up in the 70s.

'Snogging' probably became popular about the same time as 'bonking',
although 'shagging' has been making a comeback in the 90's. Hell,
post-Austin Powers, even Americans know what it means!

On a slightly more substantial note, I'm interested by what Judy said about
symbolic logic:

still

aspect

In a sense, symbolic logic is not 'just another branch' of maths: it's an
essential foundation of most branches of mathematics. Any formal proof
requires a process that, if not actually written as formal logic, should be
able to be reduced to it.

I don't think that symbolic logic was intended to replace the non-symbolic
kind, but was an attempt to systematize the kind of conscious reasoning that
goes back to Aristotle. It does swallow up whole fields; at least in the
sense that it narrows those fields. It's a constant reminder to question the
foundations of any field: if the meta-axioms (law of the excluded middle,
for example) don't apply, then any reasoning built upon that foundation will
collapse.

As an interesting aside, there's a lot of criticism of the binary true/false
nature of Western logic. It's ironic, then, that Leibniz's development of
binary arithmetic was partly based upon his reading of the I Ching!

The last straw of trash depravity has been broken. . . the corrugated
love pomes have reached their messy apex.  while rushing to a
librarians' meeting last week at 9: 15 in the a.m.,  while wearing a dry
clean only taupe jacket, while frantically stamping down W. 14th st nyc
to get a train to go to the New York Public sixth floor administrative
offices where i'm being taught to "manage"  i passed upon the curb


                                    a LUNCH   pome  !!!!


yep! the word lunch embedded in a stack of dirty corrugated cardboard.

Stranded, late,  with no heavy duty exact-o knife at hand (o  when will
this girl _learn_ to carry the weapon of love close to her flank
always!) i walked past    longingly,  hesitated, stopped,  rubbernecked,
"should i" ?  in _these_ clothes?!  i'm late! then  running
back   dropped to my haunches & took the lunch with my fingers. jagged
edges & all    pull pull  then noticed the smell of piss  & thot  is it
on the lunch  pome  am i getting it all over me,   this isn't very
urbane     this won't smell good at the meeting     what am i _doing_?
then  ah   but i dont care        and fell to  once again.  then shortly
stood up to a puzzled look from the public  & went on my way.  thinking
ah  frank!    i gotta _lunch_ pome  i gotta _lunch_ pome    & laughed
the whole way to that insufferable sixth floor.

mina loy  & frank   you  were both right!  & god bless your sexy selves.

        Okay, but without proposals, I think I meant, and proposals are our
business, our wares, such relations are unlike poetry-bytes.
Cross-propositions might be a preferable term for "games, sets, relations."
 Poetry signifies too many or too little, depending on the company one keeps.

        Another proposal may be to carefully elaborate the divide by means of

behind the outside of an inside of an outside double wall opens into
imaginary news and fantasies of the real for real outside world
fabricated by a solitary self-employed publisher, I'm going to show you
a book Walter Benjamin and Ruth Berlau willed to me, are you familiar
with the tract of land known as the Miller home place?  For sixty years
you know who owns the place what sides does it join where is your land
the land referred to in the 1940 deed is the land located on the north
side of the line marked "MM" the Miller place on the north side and the
east side of my field on the eastern side of a line marked six hundred
sixty-five what is the western boundary of your land where it joins to a
road it's been a road ever since I was big enough to walk pointed out to
you by your grandmother or anybody else the land which you now own my
grandma pointed out.  How many years did they till it they tilled it up
until how far west was the land tilled, up to this road, where is the
road now, identify where we are, the road is on the eastern side of the
ditch, the ditch on the land you tilled and your people tilled up until
from the time that--that's right, did you work in the fields with them,
I plowed the land, where to the east did you plow, I plowed up until
this ditch was dug a document and ask you if that represents the road
Grandpa gave Pop to go to and from the field I had to plow it and disc
it and drag it to keep it up, did you fill the chuckholes, we kept the
bridges up, bridges over what, over these ditches, during the time you
have known about this is it the same road today is it here that was
there years ago, yes, you farmed near this road on the western side
during my time you or your people did ever till on the western side, it
was done before I dug the ditch, before my grandma died, that physical
construction of being in language, to make a work instrumental as
possible, black adhesive letraset spelled out on a wall, ONE QUART
EXTERIOR GREEN INDUSTRIAL ENAMEL THROWN ON A BRICK WALL, concrete
specificity of a social life that is felt as much as thought, a
homestead warmed by the wish for intimacy, unity and identity, in a
structure called "blind" he writes to see his hands reach for the
doorknob, a room in the center of a city filled with light and sound of
a waterfall pavilion this block of stone, the block as a record of what
was simply about putting in place a volume or mass.  This white light
that you saw from the side of it, were those on both sides or just on
the one side if they are on the inside or not in words, in other words,
you can observe them as though they are from either direction on both
sides whether they have lights inside from your position in the train,
József watching the train, leaning in the light in each compartment,
this is how the days go by, you were saying you can see a white light
coming through a peephole, by seeing that white light then, you have got
to know when you looked out, did you look when the excessive cry was
heard and when you looked out did you look, why did you look, why is
that, well, there's a space of probably ten feet from this seat to that
seat, that would be if I were to look out this way, would I see anything
other than the buildings going by the window, so that you are seated
closer as the train approaches and you are travelling on the south side
of the tracks, couldn't you have seated yourself in any other position,
yes, I could have, true, so that if you were to look out you would see
better because you would be closer than you would be to it, no, I
couldn't see it at all, you could observe it better than you could
observe on the other side I couldn't observe the other one, the other
side, did you observe what you just said, if I understand you is
that--what did you see, could you tell me again, what did I see when I
heard the excessive cry, it was a clear night and dry, you saw the white
light, yes, do you recall that, yes, could the train have been
travelling faster, couldn't have been, this particular train I don't
believe it could have been because I am talking about capacity, as much
as probably doubling it, okay, fine, were you thrown backwards or
forwards or sideways, did you initiate this emergency, it is just a
position, a subject position, you take it and throw the position the way
you throw the lever the air flows in words the speed with which you
throw the lever that has nothing to do with it, you don't know how it
works, or how it is supposed to or anything, none to my knowledge you
walked back did you walk by yourself or with anybody else, had you
walked back or not, and as you walked back what is the first thing that
you saw, the young man laying along the right-of-way and the young lady
laying along the right-of-way, that was just about it at the time, had
there been an accumulation of people or not, were they there when you
got there, how much time do you think it took you to get back there, did
you talk to anybody after you got there, what did you do, I observed the
bodies, I took my jacket off and covered this girl up--or, I think I
covered her up, I tried to afford her some comfort with my jacket, that
is just about all, I didn't hear all of it.  What did you hear.  He was
trying to give Bill some instructions as to how to weld or something and
he just ended it with that, with what, with "That isn't the way to talk
to that man, Bill," and he turned--who did you say that to?  Why did you
say that?  Because, you know, I didn't feel you were supposed to address
another man like that, you should have more composure than that, he
turned and again said, "Just come on out of there."  Did you answer when
he said that.  No.  He just ignored you.  Yes.  And he said, "Come on
out of there."  Well, before he told him to come out of there, he used
some vulgar words.  What were the vulgar words.  "Damn it."  Bill has
been known to use much stronger language.  Just tell me what he used
that day.  I just want to know what was used on this particular day.
"Damn it" was all that was heard that day.  There was something else but
I can't think of it.  Oh, yes, it was right at my left ear he was, I'm
not sure if I had made my weld or not but I was standing there and I had
my hood up like this and they had a little argument then, you know,
after he said that.  Something about turning the heat up on the
machine.  Darrell Duncan, my foreman, up to this point, do I understand
that you had no words with Darrell Duncan, yes, well, Mr. Duncan has
always taken a special interest in me from the first day, I am not
interested in that, I want to know what happened on this day, I can't
recall everything that was said up to this point you said everything
being said was a little hollering going on, now, to go back to this
Darrell Duncan, did you see a little girl in that vicinity standing on
the corner, I was waiting, just looking around like anybody else, and I
noticed a little girl standing on the corner, standing on the sidewalk,
and she walked across the green grass and as she walked I took my eyes
off her this little girl on this corner just before she stepped into the
street she went across the green grass where she was walking just before
she stepped into the street a moment ago to a tree lawn where this
little girl was walking to from the time you saw her and the time she
came to a stop, this is the walk, this is the grass, what else could I
do then?  It was like all over.  A big shot of bourbon such as scotch
and soda.  Did he have either his knife or his gun in his hand at that
time when you went to the side door?  What was in his hands at the time
that he was going to the side door?  He said, "Get your damn head away
or I will blow it off."  I went to the other door in the pantry and
reached up and got my gun after he said, "I am going to blow your head
off."  But to look at just Jones, no, he didn't say that, but it may
have at some time, he may have said something like that to me, place
your machine in a position where you would be able to hear the
conversation, in a place that would not obstruct anybody, where did you
place your machine when I was in the corner of that particular room, ask
who is absent from the dress, did you have any other clothing on other
than that clothing, that dress and some high heel strapless shoes and
silk stockings and coat and necklace and bracelet, my underwear, you
mean a bra and panties, yes, and a slip, yes, was that a half slip or a
full slip, half slip, when you left the dance hall you walked over to
Bog's car and you got in his car to get to his house East 55th to
Superior down Superior until about East 66th at that time you arrived at
his home during the time from the Hall to his house did you have any
conversation with him at the time, I am asking him where he is taking
me, he was talking about he went over to that joint on, I think it is
105th and Cedar, I don't know the name of it, anyway he said that
somebody, I don't know who it was, somebody was telling him in the
joint, some man told him that Louise was running around, she used to go
with him, it was tough enough that she wasn't going to go home with him,
after you picked Billy up besides going directly to your house we got to
my house, Louise in the middle and Billy Boyd was on the opposite side
of me, he got out to let me out, Louise got out, and she got out on the
street side walking around on the side, so when she got up in my yard he
told her she wasn't going in my house, she was going home with him, just
like that, "You are going with me," and he told me I didn't have nothing
to do with it.  She has scars, you know, where he done choked her, and
she fell in the hall, when you come in my house you come into the hall,
she fell, he got on her, my husband got up, my husband come to the top
of the steps, he had on his shorts, he said "You all ain't going to
fight, I don't have no fights myself," he said, after he run back and
put on his bathrobe.  Now, at this time then again Reed said to the guy,
"I think we have to use our own common sense and our own live
experiences here to decide what kind of group we are talking about, and
whether this is just talking to passersby coming out of the show or
whether he is talking to eight or nine.  They were with him.  There was
Willie Dunn, Rudy Westerfield, Ugley Mayes, Nathan Gunnoe or Gunnahue,
something like that, Rudy Young, then there was Fred Warner, Dwayne
Denhart, Dwayne and Dennis Denhart--Tom's sons--Jim Jordan and I forget
the other guy's name, I can't think of the other guy's name.  He turns
with his side and his back towards Reed and I believe with his thumb or
his hand, "Is this the one?"  Is that the one he said immediately,
immediately was the word he used, Jones asked Reed did the boys come up,
he said it was almost right away, almost right away and immediately, if
that one boy said immediately and the other boy said almost right away,
maybe it is a figure of speech, there was strong slang phrases used
telling us he told you how a gun had touched him, can you imagine,
touched him, touching the barrel of a gun to your forehead in a dark
alley, young people again, a crowd of young people, and someone comes up
to him and this someone says that this boy has got a gun, someone said
that the man was with a gun and the gun is so heavy that the coat is
hanging lop-sided, like that, this is a 17-year old boy with a gun that
was there for a reason and this is exactly the reason it was there, the
gun was taken from the pocket, and I was there at the time you are
talking about and it didn't happen that way.  He said he never saw Romeo
Conner standing there or taking any part in the argument, and there is a
lot of talk about how he put a gun to the head of Reed, that he was one
of these people that did to Reed a friend of his or acquaintance or how
close the friendship might be, and two other people that were in that
alley.  What I'm trying to say to you is that if I say something that is
different from what you remember or how it was said or knew it was said,
don't remember what I remember, rely on what you heard and what you
saw.  There was some contact between these people before.  By saying now
publicly and openly for the first time that you used the word pistol,
did you have a pistol, a gun is a gun, if you did the shooting, if you
shot the gun, and when you dropped that gun, you said you dropped in on
Dave, you said Dave had that gun in his hand after the shooting, at the
time I was being shot at, just everything automatically happened as it
followed the gun, not once, but several times, you shot the gun if you
say you guess you shot the gun, you only surmised that after he died.
Did he ask you to do anything for him at that time, the last time you
saw him, this was on the last visit you had with him, make him a
milkshake or make him a little dinner, you put that into it, the last
time you saw him, he seemed to have all of his thinking faculties, and
one question in particular that was asked him, that he hesitated for
about a minute, and you asked him whether he heard the question or not,
is that the way he always carried on, very slow talker, you know that he
was a slow talker, and during those times you knew him to be a slow
talker, he was the same as far as I have always known him to be, the
conversation had wired him up, that was consistent with the way he had
conducted himself before, he would never say he was wired, did he ever
say he was wired is why he didn't want to talk, you are here saying you
don't remember any snow on the ground.  It was light snow.  You are sure
there was snow on the ground, it was moist, it was blowing, it wasn't
really sticking when you left was it snowing I think it was just cold
when you would breathe, it would show a sort of misty look, whether or
not the streets had any snow on them, whether the streets were icy or
snowy or anything like that meaning any ice that night it was snowing by
then it had started, it was a light snow, about what time that snow
started I can't say, there wasn't a great amount when you left did it
seem slippery or icy to you where you were walking you noticed there was
accumulation of snow oh no, there was a light covering of snow, you
could observe that, you could tell that night, you could see a little
bit of the coloring, you were just sitting down and talking, talking and
helping her prepare dinner, when you went outside to leave, did you
leave together, was the porch light on, could you see the stairs, she
touched your arm, I think there was a place for one, when you came out
was it snowing more, did you exchange comments or have any conversation
while you were standing on the porch after you left with everybody else
that was at the table, did you stand on the porch, or did you just walk
out the door and go down the stairs, or attempt to go down when you
left, as you went to go down the stairs, were you holding the hand, were
you holding her hand going down the stairs, did you go before or after
him, you watched him go down the stairs and he was standing at the
bottom after he left and started down the stairs without you, had he
gotten all the way down the stairs yet, was he standing below waiting
for you or were you walking down directly behind him, you intended to
follow him down the stairs, didn't you, did you look at him like you
normally look, what did you see when you looked to him, this was before
he started down the stairs, I didn't just stop and look, that wasn't
like that.  Some representation of bodies near the border, volumetric
penciled words, tongue, English, dialect, brogue or cipher, formed into
a moundlike shape, bringing to mind Richard Serra's CASTING (1969), made
by throwing molten lead into the angular section between floor and wall
like if each individual drives the same truck where he was more than
that particular part there was mostly from the black .

The New American Poetry In Context
Maria Damon
Michael Davidson

The New American Poetry appeared at a time when intellectuals and
politicians were urging a consensus on American superiority in all
fields-cultural, military, economic-against foreign influences abroad and
domestic subversion within. Michael Davidson will examine to what extent
Cold War cultural/political assumptions still shape our reading of The New
American Poetry in our present era. "Membership" in poetry communities
points to shared values and assumptions, mutual agreements over such issues
as "what is a poet?" "what should a poet write" and "what is a poet's
work?" By examining the ideas of poetic labor of two California poets, one
included in the anthology (Wieners) and one left out (Kaufman), Maria Damon
will help us better understand the ideas and values of that time, ideas and
values which impact our own time as well.

I have his 1997 book here now, and have been dipping. But my god, this is
dull stuff! I can not see that it is, I mean in the first 25 pages,
anything other than casual correspondence, with no music whatever. Maybe it
is the point to make it completely devoid of music, but how is that a kind
of oppositional poetry, when the mainstreamers in England have no music
anyway? I mean this is a place where they take Larkin seriously as a poet,
and then Motion gets into trouble for writing a nasty biog of Larkin. Good
Lord!

Back from various parts and catching up, greetings.  Is it too late to
fourteenth the endorsement of Rachel Loden's book? -- just stellar.

I'm looking for examples (in translation) of the practice of posting
review-poems in the plazas where major & new works of sculpture had just
been installed in Renaissance Italy.  Can anyone out there point me in the
right direction?

BC and thanks in advance.

I wanted to announce a "preview" version of a web-poem called "The Naif and
the Bluebells" that I've been working on for the past several weeks.  This
is a short version of the whole thing, which will find it's final home on
www.ubu.com, the concrete/sound poetry site that Kenny Goldsmith runs.

The short version -- about 30% or so of the long-version -- contains no
Javascripts, fewer applets, and lighter images, and was made especially for
those with 3.0 generation browsers or slow modems and processors.  It can
be found at:

http://www.bway.net/~arras

Please check it out, and certainly tell me if something doesn't work!

(This is also the Arras site, which I'm presently updating -- it's pretty
ugly right now.  Stay away from the sugar free!)

Cheers,
Brian

right on, George,

larkin, motion, meme combat! dull, pointless,idiotic -- which doesn't worry me,
let them write whatever pleases them -- but, as always, it's them and the power
they wield(ed) that kept/keeps the live brit poetry from being published,

  1st

there's a billboard down peachtree from here by the waffle house that for a
year or so has alwasy been a marlboro cig board and i guess they stopped
paying for that locale or something but the sign co. came out and defaced it
tearing corners and wide swaths across the middle and such, even leaving
some bits hanging etc etc

but having i guess absorbed the marlboro iconography and seen most of the
billboards what came out of this defacing was much more . . . interesting
(to me) . . . schwittersesque . . . marlboro ad . . .

the surgeon general's warning was legible at least twice



  2nd

standing under a tree in the rain and i noticed that the undersides of every
leaf that i cd see were speckled and i looked closer and they were spotted
with .. ? .. eggs or fungus or something there was a symmetry that was on
the verge of not being there but still *was* and i noted this but still felt
this sort body to body empathy with the tree

It's a blindness to call Philip Larkin absolutely no good as a poet.  This
sort of blindness will simply reaffirm itself when challenged because,
essentially, it's a dismissal in terms of style or, perhaps, genre. If you
want to say that he was hostile to avant-gardist poetic practice, that's so
obvious it's hardly worth saying.  An authentic poetic darkness lay beneath
Larkin's orderly, rhyming verses, a wiggly thing.  And he had that
unmistakable gift of making memorable lines.  It's highly unlikely a non-poet
would have been so influential. The turncoat but unfortunately interesting
Motion biography at least indicated sources of this darkness.  I spent a
couple of hours with Larkin once and when (discussing "Ambulances") I
suggested that we might not, after all, be alone when we die we got very
stiff with each other, because I was tapping into his evident panic on this
question -- that's the darkness again.  He had to be sedated when he
underwent his own process of dying because he was panicking so much.  (But
for all I know I may have to be too one day . . .)

Though adept at poetry politics, Motion is deadly dull, yes: he's got the
despicable job of laureat now (despicable because tied into the British
royalty/class system) but his poetry has not been very influential.

I am in no sense a supporter of Larkin and never have been.  Our problem with
him in Britain in the sixties and seventies was very different from wondering
whether he was a poet or not.  He was reactionary artistically, politically,
and emotionally.  Ever since, the clammy influence of his style and his
consciousness have put a blight on mainstream poetic practice.  But, then,
that's just the mainstream.  It has its audience.  So has the experimental
wing, thank god, and if they can nibble at that mainstream audience so much
the better.

Reading the Davis/Durgin correspondence, many tangential and rather less
abstract questions come to "mind" (if that's not being perhaps nominally
overly optimistic ... ), like
Efficacy in terms of what?
What are the propositions?
What do they propose in terms of politics?
What's to be effected?
How does the effected effect effect anything political, in what "sphere"?
Who is the "efficacy" for?
To whom are "proposals" to be addressed?
Is it all just in one big self-reflective house of mirrors &/or cards that
the whole argument "takes place"? (Ah ... the lovely and familiar "it" motif
again ... )  As in fact, what IS

"the argument"?  A parsing of consciousness itself, so as to make its
otherwise smothering protoplasmic theosophic "body" look to be more the
familiar bite-sized sequence of pieces we all might more easily accustom
ourselves to?  Or, in terms of sheer etiquette

at the level of more alarmingly "rapid" shifts of consciousness, may I ask,
what do you do when you can't remember the word for "rug"?

Thanks to Susan Wheeler for that endorsement of THE LAST CAMPAIGN--in a
world in which poets, above all, hate poetry, one can't have too many of
those.  Since I never posted any blurbage here, perhaps I'll be forgiven
for passing on (with permission of course) another, somewhat
astonishing, tidbit:

"The poems combine a solid sense of form with a solid sense of politics
and irony. Since I'm in favor of all three, I'm impressed. The image of
Lenin's body (which I've not seen, since my lone visit to Moscow was all
of 30 minutes on a tarmac while Motley Crue boarded the plane) is deeply
comic and will probably show up in a dream soon.

So the best characterization of my response is 'irrational exuberance,'
though perhaps in the way that Spicer, not Greenspan, would have
understood."

like a copy ($8).

And now for something completely different:

snogging, vbl. n. slang.
[Origin unknown: cf. snug v.]
Engagement in light, amorous play, esp. kissing and cuddling.
1945 C. H. Ward-Jackson It’s a Piece of Cake (ed. 2) 56 Snogging,
courting, running around with the opposite sex. Comes from India. Thus,
‘On my leave I’m going up to the hills for a bit of snogging.’ Also used
as a verb.
1951 Sunday Pictorial 28 Oct. 10/6 Few hounds can get in more than half
an hour of ‘snogging’–their elegant term for not-too-serious courtship.
1960 N. Epton Love & English vi. 341 It is all right..to cuddle. (The
current term among teen-agers is ‘snogging’.)
1966 P. Willmott Adolescent Boys iii. 40, I went upstairs with Jill and
we did a bit of snogging on the bed.
1975 Weekend 4 Feb. 19/1 If a cinema manager tolerates snogging among
his audience he is liable to lose his licence.
Also
snog v.2 intr., to engage in snogging;
snog n., an instance of this;
'snogger, 'snogging ppl. a.
1945 [see snogging vbl. n.].
1958 ‘J. Brogan’ Cummings Report xv. 156 He is
a..girl-snogging..bounder.
1959 W. Camp Ruling Passion xii. 82 Let’s pretend we’re teenagers and
stop for a nice snog.
1962 A. Sampson Anat. Britain xxxvi. 574 The cinema has lost its
hold–except among unmarried teenagers, two-thirds of whom go at least
once a week, perhaps to snog in the doubles.
1965 J. Gaskell Fabulous Heroine 94 A most experienced snogger.
1973 M. Amis Rachel Papers 21 They were enjoying a kiss–well, more of a
snog really.
1981 R. Barnard Mother’s Boys ii. 20 They had..taken the side way
through the little cutting known popularly as ‘Snoggers Alley’.

Maybe we should take this back-channel, but there seem to be more than a
few symbolic logic fans here...

That's how it was billed (or, as we say these days, marketed) back when I
was in school, but things have changed and there's a lot of fairly serious
criticism of these notions.

Whatever your view of foundations, symbolic logic can be viewed as a branch
of mathematics.  That seems to be the distinction between symbolic logic
and other sorts of logical inquiry.

Yes yes yes.  The narrowing is an interesting (and I think invasive)
phenomenon.

Dear Maria,
Thanks for your reply. I'm glad to hear that you, too, think this was a
signal event; not everyone on the list agrees, those responses having more
to do with negative perceptions of Frost as a man and poet than anything
else. My essay is part of a larger book about American poetry in the
sixties that I'm writing. The Frost reading came early  in the decade; by
decades end, things had changed a lot (and that's an understatement!) in
both American society and American poetry; so in terms of contrast and
compare, the inaugural reading is ripe in regarding. In the poem Frost
wrote for the occasion, he prophesized a "golden age of poetry and power,"
like the Augustan age in Rome. It's such an interesting, though flawed,
comparison; much of my essay revolves around what all that might have meant
then, what it means now. There is also the Frost/Kennedy relationship; what
began as a courting/courtship (and Frost saw himself as the court poet),
ended up with Kennedy not speaking ever again to Frost after the later's
return from a trip to Russia in September, 1962, where he met with
Khrushchev. Of course, October, 1962 brought the Cuban Missile Crisis, etc.
Anway, I'll be glad to share the essay with you when it's done. Right now
it's 27 pages, and still growing!
I wasn't aware of any of the sources you mentioned. How can I get a copy of
Zofia Burr's unpublished ms?
Thanks for your help,
Mark Melnicove

Subject:      Non-Meaningful Levels of Language - A Query
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I'm giving a graduating lecture (description follows) at mainstream Vermont
College MFA in Writing program, and would love comments/suggestions on
potential sources & references that would help address the lecture questions
properly for a relatively conservative audience of readers/writers.  Thanks!!!

GNOSIS, NONSENSE, NADA

"The future of poetry lies in the exploitation of non-meaningful levels of
language.  These levels establish poetry as a form of discourse that must be
read as entirely separate from normal, communicative language, read with its
materiality, its artifice in mind...".  (Veronica Forrest-Thomson, Poetic
Artifice).
        What a claim!  Why write apparent 'nonsense?'  What possible project
might we have for a poetry of relative 'obfuscation'?  How can language that
simultaneously conceals and reveals help us 'know'?
        If words don't refer to clear particulars and concepts, how can such
"non-meaningful levels of language" facilitate gnosis?  If a poem's language
is syntactically and semantically fluid, diffusing boundaries between
subject/object, self/other, hwere else might a reader be taken (besides into
confusion, even boredom)?  What are the chances for finding value in visual,
kinesthetic, musical, or mathematical meaning, rather than depending on a
more familiar thematic meaning?
        Do we want to accept an 'experimental' or 'avant garde' poetry's
claim to provide us with a much-needed psychic invasion to strip us of our
'thought-coverings'?  Would we then descend into a meaningless abyss,
nothingness, into our little 'nada' selves?
        As Brenda Hillman suggests in her epigraph to Blue Codices (from
Loose Sugar), it is enticing to entertain the notion that we might "Explain
the unknown/ by the more unknonw," a saying she attributes to "an alchemical
theorem."  By taking a look at Hillman's poetry, and probably other work by
Mary Reufle, Lyn Hejinian, John Taggart, Rosemary Waldrop, and/or Donald
Revell (list is bound to change), this lecture will tousle around (on mats of
course) in the hoary backyard of this 'pissed-on' and 'pissed-upon'
territory.  It's important to dwell on handouts in office before coming to
wrestle.
_________________________________________________________________
I have, at this late date, a far more intuitive than concrete handle on the
answers to some of these questions, and have been investigating everything
from gnostic scriptures like Nag Hammadi and Elaine Pagels' books --  to
Perloff, introductions to 'experimental' anthologies, and other ready-at-hand
critical writing.  Unfortunately, I've just been faced with a sudden need to
move my entire household, and would like to get to the bottom of this subject
in some kind of usable, presentable fashion as quickly as possible (although
I'm sure the topic requires at least a lifetime of writing and reading and
studying).
        If anyone has ideas about how to approach this lecture, what to read,
who to quote, or how to articulate the direction that you sense the questions
are leading me in, please let me know.  I'd be immensely grateful.
        Thanks,
Aviva Vogel, Poetangles & Motherdrum, Norwich, VT 05055

Subject:      also known as anti-rhyme
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Greetings,

I'm piecing together an essay on a particular aspect of rhyme, and am a bit
stuck for some additional resources.  I am hoping that someone(s) on the
list might have some thoughts on where I might find some supporting (or
contradictory) information to work with.

The most concise way to present my particular bent is with an excerpt from
TNPEoPaP definition of Rhyme--IV. Analogues:  "Milton also weights words at
line end (Broadbent calls this "anti-r".), counterposing semantically heavy
and contrastive terms at PL 4.561-62, for example:  'Tempt not the Lord thy
God, he said and stood.  /  But Satan smitten with amazement fell""

Is this thing that Broadbent calls anti-rhyme called something else by
everyone else, or has no one else written about it else?  See, it's driving
me to echolalia.

I would appreciate reading any thoughts any of you might have (or examples
that leap to mind), backchannel or not.  I live in a part of the world
where poetry died in 1963 when they took down the last Burma-Shave sign, so
the pickins here are pretty slim.  (Asked the local librarian if they had a
copy of Modern Chess Openings, and she brought me over to the Medical
section).

Thanks,

                         -----------------
                             Abstracts

         o Abstract: Susan Howe's _Articulation of Sound
           Forms in Time_ is considered in light of
           Heidegger's condition of an "openness to mystery"
           or as Gerald Burns explains, "the region of the
           question" and its uncontainability within finite
           interpretations." The importance of Howe's work
           lies in its testing of the conditions of mastery
           and control--issues that are among those Howe
           explores and incorporates from her readings of
           Emily Dickinson.  Interpretations, such as those
           of Perloff and Reinfeld, begin with the
           re-assembling of a narrative from the fragments
           that Howe offers.  Such a critical direction
           suggests the act of interpretation must be, or can
           only be, a normative, disciplining method.  Such a
           process must be resisted: the retrieval of
           histories, texts, and identities does not imply a
           necessary containment or totalizing of memory.
           Memory, instead, allows for imaginative inquiry,
           which is redoubled in Howe's poem, with the
           possibility of prophecy: the Falls Fight of 1676
           that Howe uses as her foundational source becomes
           a mirror for ourselves.  Hope Atherton prefigures
           the conditions and failures of community, as well
           as a genealogy of policing.  As prophecy, Howe's
           poem invites us to participate in the signifying
           process; each word of the poem becomes a site for
           meditation and a reflection on the history of what
           was and what is still becoming.--jm


      Jed Rasula, "Textual Indigence in the Archive"

         o Abstract: Currently the Internet animates dreams
           of instantaneous telepresence and rapid data
           transfer, but the "dromocratic" revolution also
           makes rapid conceptual transit compulsory
           (Virilio).  The modern enthrallment with speed is
           a nascent stipulation of communication
           technologies that are modeled on, and answerable
           to, the cross-referencing mobility pioneered in
           the Enlightenment encyclopedia.  The efficiency
           of the archival web of encyclopedism readily
           leads to a complacent mirage of power and control.
           In order to examine this mirage, I discuss two
           "encyclopedic" novels--_Moby-Dick_ and _The Magic
           Mountain_--which disclose, below the utopian
           fantasy of unambiguous signals and noise-free
           channels, a salutary posture of indigence.  The
           peril attendant on digitized telepresence is that
           the uniform coding of data obliterates tactile
           agency.  But a phantom materiality lingers on,
           traceable by way of the cross-referencing and
           multiple-coding options of the Encyclopedia.  The
           challenge of a plenitude of cross-referencing is
           one of surfeit: the enhancement of cognitive
           speed, confronting the increased magnitude of
           material to which its rapid conceptual transit
           makes access, reinstates idealism as a vindictive
           triumph over matter.  The novels I examine by
           Melville and Mann confront mountains of data, but
           resist the enticements to mobility of encyclopedic
           culture, casting their lots instead with an
           indigent reserve, rehearsing narrative tactics of
           delay, meander, filibuster.  Maximizing the
           tension between documentation and storytelling,
           they demonstrate the epistemological lesson that a
           surface rationalism conceals an atavistic
           endowment that is at once a "pre-rational" or
           mythic threat as well as a repository of creative
           energy--the very energy required in order to
           compose the work: nothing less than a microbial
           sentience that makes us what we are without our
           ever having to know anything about it, the charmed
           circle of life itself in which the pleasures of
           circulating exceed the compass of human
           knowledge.--jr

excerpt from a group of "phobia" poems:
"Pogonophobia"
 _Fear of Beards_

Shell delicate, the green chin's cracked: broken
waxwing, broken wryneck.  The down ups, bristling,
kinking into curls.  A fly-specked plaster,
a cambric snicked with stitches: this grizzling

frets against the grain.  Scrit, scrit: the lie bare-faced,
the whiskered fibbery--lily-white boys, cheek
by jowl among the stubble. Peach-fuzz to
blue-beard, she's caught in their swart penumbra.

Like the gossamer thread sprung from her arm
a full three inches when she was eight, it
opened her eyes.  Out of the glass each barb
of it speaks: Trust me. I hide what you are.

Solve for x.

Poems, or, texts. That which is presented as a poem, or as poetry.

Investigation, argument, engagement, sabotage, bells, whistles.

Hey that not standard. You mean what will it do? It will do the we are

Hey that not standard. Colonial vocab, ha? How does anything have an effect,
reiteration. Effect is usually accidental, a mistake, soemthing happens. You
think a while, you rest,
you have the thought, or you don't.

Please no bite-sized sequence of pieces of my "body". Otherwise sounds good
sounds like Whalen. Instead of follow the money or follow the paper follow
the mind. But also follow the paper follow the money.

So far I enjoy that, today I couldn't remember "promiscuous." Ron Padgett's
essay on mixing up "grapefruit" with "pineapple". Or when you call the
rectangle on the floor a "toupee." I guess read some Oliver Sacks?

Hope you're well,
Jordan

        Not intending to be glib, let me propose that proposing such questions is
just the sort of thing I was refering to:  necessarily abstract, you see.
Although the hall of mirrors is apt, Jordan used the standing across the
crater analogy, or rather proposed it.  I picked it up, in ensemble.
Therefore, I think your question "Who is the 'efficacy' for?" is a
fascinating and difficult one.  For instance, if this whole little
speculative tiff came out of Notley's comments in the Combo 3 interview, as
I recall (?), an interesting thing to do would be to consider the
poetician's sense of anticipated audience, while she or he proceeds to
fashion her or his argument so as to issue most freely and provocatively
through this audience.  Of course, the audience is never uncritical, and
this is where cross-propositions come into play and generate "context"  --
there is no REASON such a context should thereby cordon itself.  Despite a
lot of younger, experimental writers' notions that it inevitably does.
This is my sense, anyhow.

I knew a man...John Pallio..who was on the stand about 10 feet away from
Frost...

It was an extremely cold day...there were  electric heaters set up to warm
the feet of the assembled...and somehow one of them caught fire in the middle
of Frost's poem...many were anxious...Frost was oblivious...

Stared Stiff


I'm staring at:

Dynamic HTML, The Definitive Reference
Web Design in a Nutshell
Linux in a Nutshell
Year 2000 in a Nutshell
Internet in a Nutshell
Learning Perl on Win32 Systems

and I'm thinking: The _thickness_ of these texts presenting _potentials_
or matrices resulting long term in the construction of _worlds._ Dynamic
HTML (Danny Goodman) set me off in this direction - page after page of
reference (and of course still nothing compared, say, to the X Window
manuals) - particulations, attributes of objects, protocols given in full.
What I'm referencing is the _texture_ of the manual and its role as open
source - atomics - moleculars - for emergences - but also the defuge asso-
ciated with these manuals - the paste-like exhaustion - concatenating
strings - and think of the attributions - the _properties_ - of all the
objects in the world. Like "bgcolor" these are emptied, waiting. Quote
"now that the _animate_ object is defined" - further - <BODY><DIV ID="ani-
mate"> This Enormous Life-Form Which Will Dominate Your Small and Vulner-
able BODY </DIV></BODY> - HTML is all HEAD and BODY - ANIMATEDHTML - "Our
Animate Boy" - 1933 - "Our Animate Girl" - 1944 (more complex and in War-
time) - What is the Life-Form - What is Emerging from this Thickness - Who
are the Readers with Talons - What Surgical Performances - What Satanic

Internet Philosophy and Psychology -                              June.99


This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net, and sent in the form of texts to various lists (Cybermind and
fop-l, and sometimes cyberculture, all of which I comoderate). The URL is:
http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/ and the mirror (without java-
sript, graphics, The Case of the Real, a short novel (Ma) or dhtml pages)
is http://lists.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html.

The changing nature of the email lists, Cybermind and Fiction-of-Philoso-
phy, to which the texts are sent individually, hides the full body of the
work; readers may not be aware of the continuity among them. The writing
may appear fragmented, created piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent
whole. On my end, the whole is evident, the texts extended into the lists,
part or transitional objects.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as total-
ity. Below is an updated introduction.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The "Internet Text" currently constitutes around 90 files, or 2800 printed
pages. It was started in 1994, and continues as an extended meditation on
cyberspace. It began with a somewhat straightforward theoretical outline,
and has expanded into wild theory and literatures.

Almost all of the text is in the form of short-waves or long-waves. The
former are the individually-titled sections, written in a variety of
styles, and at times referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are
heavily interrelated; on occasion emanations appear, "emanants" possessing
philosophical or psychological import. They also create and problematize
narrative substructures within the work as a whole. Such are Julu, Alan,
Jennifer, Nikuko, in particular. Overall, I'm concerned with virtual-real
subjectivities and their interpenetrations, in relation to various philo-
sophical issues. Recently, I've been working with simple reworkings of the
emacs doctor program, and writing dhtml pages, exploring parsing and rhe-
torics of control, erotics, and sublimation.

The long-waves are fuzzy loci bearing on such issues as death, love, vir-
tual embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical reality, computer
languages, and protocols which weave throughout the texts. The resulting
splits and coalescences owe something to phenomenology, deconstruction,
linguistics, prehistory, programming, etc., as well as to the functionings
of online worlds in relation to everyday realities.

I have used MUDS, MOOS, talkers, perl, d/html, qbasic, linux, emacs, Cu-
SeeMe, etc., all tending towards a future of being-and-writing, texts
which act and engage beyond traditional reading practices. Some of the
work emerges out of performative language such as computer programs or MOO
commands which _do_ things; some emerges out of interference with these
languages, or conversations using internet applications that are activated
one way or another.

There is no binarism in the texts, no series of definitive statements.
Virtuality is considered beyond the text- and web-scapes prevalent now.
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real VR are
already in embryonic existence, permitting the theorizing of present and
future sites, "spaces," nodes, and modalities of body/speech/community.

Please check the INDEX to find your way into the earlier body of the work.
The Case of the Real is useful. It is also helpful to read the first file,
Net1.txt, and/or to look at the latest files (kw kx, etc., which are still
to be indexed) as well. Skip around. The Index lists the files in which a
particular topic is described; you can then do a search on the file, or
simply scroll down (the files range in length from 30 to 50 pages in
print). (Note: I have stopped working on the index; for the later files, I
suggest you skim. Eventually, I need a site and a local search engine for
the texts; at the moment, I apologize for the awkwardness of it all.)

The texts may be distributed in any medium; please credit me. I would ap-
preciate in return any comments you may have.

For a weird little reading experience,
folks who want to see how badly 20th century poetry can be misinterpreted
are directed to:
www.newcriterion.com/archive/17/jun99/lyons.htm
which is the site for a very strange little article on Pound
by someone who truly hates The Cantos and everything such verse bred.
He suggests that their motivation is simply Joyce envy.

In back of Aristotle in this particular context, loom the "numerical
systems" of ancient epic (Gilgamesh, the Old Test.), wch was be "told" by
numerical placement & relation rather than narrativized in the yet-to-be
developed grammer etc. of ... Greeks?  ie., it was all plot/plat, like a
celestial map that also works as a neuro-muscular gloss, that is,  "story"
at that point was the ultimate maybe non-linear logic, or perhaps logic =
epic in that sense is the nose by wch Aris. was led toward "conscious
reasoning" of the system whilst equally within it, or how to accomplish the
telling of the tale of each those things it takes far less time to
completely count remains an account we haven't yet learned to pay in full,
unless by "symbolic"

we mean "I am no longer the man that either ordered or ate the breakfast
that was here, so therefore, I'm not paying for it."

All statements are self-possessed by their inversions; one claim invokes its
opposite; runs hot and cold, confronts & simultaeneously runs away from, the
very fleeting quality of these "reversals" as,
unnegotiably conflictive, yet in terms of

the alchemy you mention, there is a "trick" - to permit the twin aspects of
such duality  to interpenetrate, not nonsensically, especially, but
dogmatically using as a basis the familiar alchemical bumper-sticker, "as
above, so below" - and all variations of it, ie., "bury the bone deeper" in
that way that Brenda Hillman characterizes as knowing the unknown via a
greater unknown, or the homepathic "cure like with like" (the toxin /
anti-toxin route), so

what you'll "get" in some end (so one hopes), is a cross-fertilization in
which something like the electromagnesis of gravity might be felt to "rise"
(as a heart might) out of the ground laid out where the influx that ignites
the desire to "do it" in the first place is shaped by one's own
thermodynamic gesture that makes the object at its end equal to the subject
of its means, not to say also, that at certain times, certain of these
objects, subjects, gestures, hearts, grounds, ignitions and gravities may
appear to be upsidedown and/or insideout.
But of course,

that's why it's called "nonsense" - as if that's the best thing it could get
to be.  It.  The "knowing" of the knowing "form".  Why not deliver the
lecture standing on your head?  Not forgetting of course also, to wiggle
your toes when the going gets serious.  There ARE no "non-meaningful levels
of language", tho of course, there is plenty of important cultural detritus
about that nobody understands.

CFP NEMLA 2000 (April 7-8, SUNY@Buffalo)

Poetics/Production: Modern and Post-Modern Little Magazines

This session invites papers on any aspect of innovative poetry production
(both in the sense of the writing of poetry and the reproduction/printing
thereof)
or the production of poetics, as these relate to Modern and Post-Modern (and

contemporary) little magazines.

We will focus chiefly on American and Canadian little magazines, though
papers on
British little magazines as they relate to American poetry are welcome.
Papers might
focus on specific little magazines or editors, particular poets or 'scenes',
a specific
lineage (e.g. women editors, 'minor' and/or otherwise obscured schools, such
as
Black Mountain, San Francisco Renaissance, and the Objectivists, and the
development
of current innovative poetic practice), or any other aspects of poetics and
production.
Current and recent little magazine editors are encouraged to contribute;
non-traditional
academic or non- and anti-academic papers and perspectives are welcome.

The little magazine has a rich history in the United States and Canada, as
evinced by the
recently published _A Secret Location on the Lower East Side: Adventures in
Writing,
1960-1980_ (Granary Books, 1998).  It is a history that is particularly
attuned to poetry
because poets and editors, especially avant-garde poets and editors, both
helped create
and were themselves created by modernist little magazines (such as Margaret
Anderson's
_The Little Review_, Ezra Pound's _The Egoist_, Alfred Kreymborg's _Others_
and
William Carlos Williams' _Contact_); the little magazines of 'mimeo
revolution' (e.g. Diane
DiPrima's _Floating Bear_, LeRoi Jones' _Yugen_, George Stanley's _Open
Space_ and
Jack Spicer's _J_, Ted Berrigan's _C_, Maureen Owens' _Telephone_) and, more

recently, what has come to be known as Language Writing (L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E,
ed.
Bruce Andrews and Charles Bernstein, Carla Harryman's _Qu_, for example) - a
history
whose influence is felt today in the plethora of little magazines that claim
to define an
'innovative' or 'avant garde' terrain.


Deadline Sept. 1, 1999.  Send brief coversheet and one-page abstract to:

As one of the many new associate editors at Perihelion,
http://webdelsol.com/Perihelion/, I would like to call for theory and
poetry submissions.  Send them directly to me at cadaly@pacbell.net, or
send them to the editor-in-chief Rebecca Seiferle via the mailto link on
the website itself.  We're trying to publish more engaging, interesting,
and challenging work than that in previous issues.

Something about the nature of the e-mail would be good in the subject
line, and for poetry I prefer at least three poems pasted in the body of
the e-mail message, but I understand if you have to attach items which
are not all unformatted text.

I am particularly eager to read work with kitties or rainbows,
especially if you have also formatted your work with purple centered
italic.

Right, it's the politics and the power.  If you are going to fight it, surely
it has to be on that level.  If Motion & bros. have the power then telling
everyone their poetry is shit is not going to get anyone everywhere.

What is more interesting to me is where the mainstream and experiment
interact.  And, in parallel to that, the fact that some readers of so-called,
mainstream poetry, when they get the opportunity to partake of "Other"
poetries, are able to read, enjoy and respond to it.

        Motion and his pals prevent that, presumably because they are not
able to appreciate anything outside of their little world or they have a
tightly knit crowd that all publish each other and are loathe to let others
in.  Isn't' that the case with much poetry, or much publishing that is not
"commercially viable."  John Grisham gets published because he makes money
once you get past that its because someone likes it or has some other good or
nefarious reason to publish.

I am beyond sad to report that Rick Fields passed away Sunday, June 6th,
around noon Pacific Time at his home in the Bay Area.  Poet, author of
important works on Buddhism and related subjects, and editor, Rick's
best-known books include _How the Swans Came Home to the Lake: A Narrative
History of Buddhism in America_; _Chop Wood, Carry Water_; and _The Code of
the Warrior_.  He was formerly the editor of _The Vajradhatu Sun_ and _Yoga
Journal_.  He edited _ The Awakened Warrior _ and co-translated _The
Turquoise Bee: Love Songs of the Sixth Dalai Lama._ He was an extraordinary
writer.  During his five-year struggle with cancer (experts had predicted a
year) he captured an astonishing spirit and life force in a series of poems
published under the title _Fuck You, Cancer, and Other Poems_ — a work that
has served many people who are dealing with life-threatening illness,
whether patients or their friends, family, doctors, and hospital staff.
Rick was loved and his work appreciated by a great many people, and those
who knew him benefited immeasurably from his quality of presence,
generosity and his own species of lightness and joy of being.  Just the way
he handled illness with such presence and openness was, for me, a great
teaching.  And so much about him was like that—a very understated gift.
Gratitude for having known him overshadows even the painful loss.

 READING THIS SATURDAY:


   from Brooklyn, RACHEL LEVITSKY

    w/
        Hometown contender, JIM CORY


HIGHWIRE GALLERY, 139 N. 2nd St.
or, if you want to go straight to the bar:
Anthony's, middle of 200 block Market St.

Saturday, June 12, 8PM (yeah right)
BYO

RACHEL DEMOCRACY LEVITSKY recently emigrated from Boulder, Colorado, where she
curated the Left Hand Reading Series. She teaches poetry to Queens kids and
teaches union members how to write unnaturally so they can pass the CUNY
writing test and go to college. She is the author of three chapbooks,
_2(1x1)Portraits_, _The Adventures of Yaya and Grace_ and _Cartographies
of Error_ forthcoming this July from Leroy Press in San Francisco. She
believes the wildlife of New York is much more wild than that of
Colorado--give her a week with a bicycle and she will prove it to you.

from The Adventures of Yaya and Grace:

"As for the lover, her/his beauty and power is a mysterious thing though
may be a ploy.  Their honesty is as deft as a bloodthirsty criminal on a
crime spree, 'here come shake my hand, now how does it feel to have
shaken the hand of a murderer?'  You hate him/her and are convinced of
his/her perfection.  You cannot decide if he/she is from heaven, and you
are the lower body, or if they are from hell, and you a creature whose
superiority is being challenged.  This all takes place in the
frightening prison tower of your darkest dream, where the walls are high
and dark and gray and everywhere there is red as an afterimage."

JIM CORY has been a staple of the Philadelphia poetry scene for over a decade
and is one of the founding editors of Phildelphia's Insight-to-Riot Press,
which has published the likes of Janet Mason, James Broughton and CA Conrad,
among others. Jim recently edited and wrote the introduction for _Packing Up
for Paradise: The Selected Poems of James Broughton_, which was published by
Black Sparrow Press in 1998. He has numerous chapbooks, of which his most
recent is _The Redheads_.

Come hear, see, experience, & talk with these wonderful poets.

March on the Pentagon
Saturday June 5, 1999

by Kristin Prevallet and Lisa Jarnot

        On Saturday June 5th there was a rally in Washington DC to protest
the ongoing US/NATO intervention in Yugoslavia.  Thousands of people
attended the day-long event. We thought that some of you might be
interested in knowing more about what happened.  There seems to have been
very little news coverage of the rally and march.
        We were part of a caravan of six buses departing from 14th street
in New York City early on Saturday morning and we arrived at the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial in Washington DC at 11am. There was a rally in the park
across from the memorial, during which people gathered and several speakers
made opening remarks about the current situation in Yugoslavia.  The green
was filled with different coalition groups opposed to the NATO military
action.  Some groups were made up of long-term political activists, others
had come together specifically around the issue of the situation in the
Balkans.  People were there from all over the country.  We heard that 10
buses had come in from Cleveland, and we met people from Boston,
Philadelphia, and Virginia as well. There also seemed to be a large
international presence at the event, including representatives from
England, Greece, Korea, Turkey, Puerto Rico and Japan.  By 2 pm the green
was full and it was difficult to make a path through the crowd.
        The rally was followed by a march from the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial to the Pentagon. It was hard to tell exactly how many people
participated in the march, but we were somewhere in the middle of it and
the crowd was impressive.  (We estimate 15,000 people.)  We marched past
the Lincoln Memorial, across the Virginia Bridge, up the Pentagon roadway
and to one side of the Pentagon building where a second rally was held.
        The group was loud and the messages were various -- from a band of
classical Japanese drummers dancing beside the marchers, to groups of young
socialists chanting slogans like "Money for schools, not for bombs," to
grade school kids holding signs that read "Stop bombing my grandparents in
Serbia".   We contributed our own signs: "Dear IMF: Free People Not
Markets"; Dear World Bank: Democracy is about people, not profits";
"NATO=DEATH"; "Clinton: Bombing Bridges into the 21st century." Other signs
included: "Clinton is a war criminal"; "Madeline Snakebite"; and "Is Kosovo
Clinton's Columbine?"
        Once at the Pentagon, about 3,000 people gathered on the lawn and
listened to a number of speakers, including Amy Goodman of Pacifica Radio,
Ramsey Clarke, Dave Dellinger, church leaders, and representatives of
Serbian, Cuban, and Puerto Rican coalitions. There weren't any poet
speakers, but we did run into fellow New York poet David Cameron, and
longtime poet activist Ed Sanders who carried a sign that read "General
Wesley Clark is a mass murderer".

There were several concerns that came up repeatedly during the afternoon--

1) all of the speakers agreed that just because the bombing may soon end,
the war is not over;
2) it seems obvious that the true goal of the bombing was to level the
region for Western occupation.  (Or as Tony Blair recently said: "Let this
be a turning point for southeastern Europe and the Balkans. Let this mark
the point at which these countries, so often scarred by ethnic conflict and
racial divides, be brought properly into the true family of European
Nations. [note emphasis on "properly" and "true."]);
3)Yugoslavia will have to request massive loans from NATO countries in
order to rebuild their industries and we have destroyed the infrastructure
of their nationalized economic system (including a nationalized health care
system).
4)the plight of refugees (both Serbian and Kosovar) is growing.
5) there are several factions of the KLA (from far right to far left) that
are increasingly difficult for NATO to keep track of. A new cycle of
violence may begin as Kosovars return to the area and seek revenge on
Serbians. (There's an article in the NYTime Sunday June 6th regarding this
issue).
6) this is just one of a series of attacks the United States has launched
in recent years for economic reasons. The situation in Iraq was handled in
a similar way.
7)The bombing does not represent victory. Aside from the refugee crisis and
the complete destruction of the region, the US has sparked an international
conflict and its relations with two major nuclear powers, Russia and China,
have deteriorated.
8) One speaker said "We are pro-Serbian but anti-Milosevic; pro-Kosovar but
anti-KLA."  That seemed to be the consensus among the protesters.
9) The United States never made an effort to negotiate any reasonable
agreement with Milosevic and the Serbian Parliament before the bombings
began.
10) Looking at the history of this conflict it becomes clear that the
United States and NATO have had an interest in seeing the region divided
up.  Since 1991 NATO has played a key role in contributing to conflicts in
the region.  Germany, Austria, the United States and other NATO countries
have interests in the region's resources of oil, coal, and bauxite.
Germany is particularly interested in a proposed oil pipeline which would
run through Serbian territory.
11) the peace movement is alive and well, but is more frequently being
ignored by the media. C-SPAN was the single news source broadcasting the
rally, and there was a media block on corporate news sources.  ABC, CBS
(Westinghouse), and NBC (General Electric) were not present. Neither the
Washington Post nor the New York Times carried ANY coverage what-so-ever
the following day. However, there were quite a few officials standing on
the roof of Pentagon with cameras taking photographs of individuals in the
crowd.
        Overall the rally certainly proved that a large number of Americans
are opposed to the US/NATO bombing campaign and occupation.  There was also
a lot of anti-Clinton sentiment in the air.   The thing that came as a
surprise to us was the eerie media silence surrounding the event.  We hope
that people will forward this information to others.  The international
Action Center in New York is planning more events around this issue
including a national day of protest set for June 26th.  They have a web
site at www.iacenter.org.   We'd also like to encourage people to write to
their representatives in congress and to Bill Clinton to voice opposition
to these events in the Balkans.  Clinton's address is--

William Jefferson Clinton
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
Washington DC 20500

There are also web sites with information and addresses at www.senate.gov

Hi,
Does anybody know who said that she called her writing poetry because
she couldn't think of what else to call it? Was it Marianne Moore?

I have had A M taken out and shot.

   Behind the barn. While I thought he might continue to win over 5
furlongs up against other contenders of his class, and while had developed
an appreciation for what remained idiosyncratic after his orthodoxizing,
the weight of judgement from my fellow-trainers and vets turned out to be
too heavy to oppose. It grieves me that we have little good to speak of
triple crown winners or even poets laureate, but I ascribe it to the times.


I argued that not every horse is bred to run a mile and a quarter, and
against the top of his contemporaries, but the stories of doping (of the
judges) by M's former trainer simply would not go away.

My only regret is that I looked into his eye moments before, well.......it
was the lively, moist eye of others of his breed, and spoke, it seemed, of
an early promise. I would like to remind readers that the Laureate Stakes
are not for every contender.  Not only is the mount himself required to be
lighter than horses usually are, but he must be ridden by a very
lightweight jockey. There are not enough contenders with such
qualifications, and I agree the rules need to be changed.

I hope I shall not be judged amiss for having taken pleasure in his
desultory gait & minor orthodoxies.

Charles Reznikoff Man and Poet, ed. Milton Hindus
(National Poetry Foundation, 1984)

This is all I've got on my bookshelf.  Charles made a lot of his own books and
those I suppose are all in the rare book rooms.  What a wonderful website those
early books would make, self-printed, handmade.

One more chain in a set of refrain retain
return to this is what it was about reading
is a basic problem a simple point that has
to be made at the beginning I saw nothing
that I should not contradict nothing gainsay
this is what I was telling you about what was
I saying that it's a relief there's no longer
anything to remember pretend it's inevitable
that the musician go mad in The Manner Music
how much does Reznikoff write himself into
the composer who burns all his manuscripts
in the park?  We returned to the cafeteria.

[from "The Sin of the Book" in COMMON KNOWLEDGE,
an unpublished "hot MS?"  Or cold as ashes.]

But it was Louis and not Charles a generation of poets built on among others
building SoundGardens inner-referring pounding out those lexicals you can learn
in a linguist here and there, the drive being toward a proto hyper-text the
machines are now perfecting, though is it irony or the ironing out of accent and
dialect--the same word spoken and broken many ways by many so many mouths
(National TV has had a hand here, standardizing speech, standardizing
(bleaching) English)--which characterizes a lot of the groundwork done by late
70s/early 80s avant garde furthered into now, the best and the worst, is it
writtenness or spokenness?  Charles was an ambulator, walked New York up and
down like Benjamin's Charles, Marx and Engels ghosting both, "The crowd--no
subject was more entitled to the attention . . . "   (p. 120) flaneur
"democratically compelled"?  Reznikoff was also a camera worker, and maybe its
the slow rhythm of his lens which has separated him from the attention given to
Zukofsky.  There's not the tight jamming of words end-nerves or pristine
crystalline word and syllable musical maypole and mayhem that's in "A" and the
shorter poems; rather slow and long and deliberate lines a lot of times, and all
the anonymous faces that rise and speak among each other, many of them workers,
and they are often most often slowly, lovingly observed, overheard, without a
lot of intention, commentary, interference--it's something, really, how the
figures of workers and the moving crowd are allowed to be let be in their
beauty, vocal and visual, maybe the kind of photography Berlau would have found
had she been able to have been found, also early documentary cinema, though it
was watching a film shooting textiles and textile workers by Ernie Gehr that
first made me think of Reznikoff's writing as camerawork, and I asked Ernie
about it during the Q & A after the show and he said yes, he'd read Reznikoff.
Well, if Ernie has, why aren't we?  And by we I mean anybody writing poetry and
thinking about the working class, and it's all right if you weren't born there,
Benjamin in that French camp spoke about the proletarianization of the Jews ("a
city of labor" is what some German administrative documents have been found
planning the Warsaw Ghetto), and "Ghetto" recurs among Reznikoff's words and
titles, the New York Jewish Ghetto, though a waitress emerges somewhere saying
"honey chile", there's all sorts of common laborers in these poems,  and
Testimony like Holocaust is a masterpiece of often raw archival footage.
Reznikoff reads as well besides Jabes as he does Stevens, for different reasons,
a neglected modernist?  Or proletarian poet waiting to be found for a new
generation just coming to writing and needing him now, he is needed now,
sometimes it takes a long time.  Has the proletariat been a prohibited content?
Reznikoff can show you how to listen and to look, how to see them and film them
slowly, lovingly, without hurry, or irony.

Hi,

I wanted to report a little bit about a meeting held on June 2 in New York
City on the subject of distribution for literary magazines. The meeting was
held under the auspices of CLMP (council of literary magazines and presses)
and was organized by me and Jenine Bockman Gordon of Literal Latte.
Participants included Faye Kosmidis of DeBoer Distribution, Cheryl Carlson,
newsstand division manager of Barnes & Noble, and Ian Brand, a bookseller
at Labyrinth Books, an independent bookstore here in New York.

What follows is extremely technical and may be of interest only to
publishers of journals: following from that, I'd love it if anyone out
there who is a publisher of a lit mag  would email me back and let me know
what you think of the following report and attached ideas.

Basically, it went very well, with the upshot being that I'm energized and
ready to make a stand for empowerment of the tiny publisher. It seems
clear, after the meeting, that everyone involved (booksellers, both chain
and independent; distributors, both small and mega; and publishers) sees a
need for the establishment of some kind of organ of articulation or
advocate for the needs and rights of the little magazine, in order for the
magazine to flourish in this our new age.

One thing established during the meeting was that, although lit mags make
up a tiny tiny proportion of the business of bookstores (especially chains)
and of the periodicals distributors who serve them, they still do remain a
desirable and indispensable commodity in that they bring into the stores
that most sought-after commodity: the literate buyer of books, the upscale
educated consumer.

Once that fact was established, we moved on to talking about the
nitty-gritty ways that we could all work together to "sell more
magazines"--with the obvious issue of their general esotericness as a
given. We talked about possible promotions, about trying to educate the
sales clerks as to the value of the lit mag, etc., and it all came down to:
great ideas, but who is going to do this stuff? Certainly not the already
overwhelmed publisher, and certainly not the distributor, whose job is to
mail out bales of mags.

Cheryl Carlson, B&N lady, then expressed a desire that there be "one
person" that she could deal with as a representative of the literary
magazines, with whom she could make plans for promotions, for better
inventory-taking, for wiser ordering, for better returns policies, etc. She
actually sounded genuinely interested in the prospect.

I nearly jumped out of my seat with I-told-you-so-ness, as this was an idea
I'd had (and proposed to CLMP without much response) in February.

Similarly, Faye Kosmidis from DeBoer agreed that it would be a good thing
if there was someone out there whose job it was to call bookstores and see
if they needed more copies of such and such magazine, and to try to educate
booksellers about the peculiarities of the journal  as a commodity (re:
frequency, shelf-life, etc).

So anyway: I'm now thinking that publishers of literary journals should
form an informal union of sorts: this way we could at least try to have
more of a voice with distributors. My next move as the Norma Rae of journal
publishers is to try to get Ingram to consider grouping all of their
literary journals with one Account Executive (currently they're scattered
all over and none of the AEs seems to have a clue as to what exactly a
literary journal is and how they might need to be treated differently in
order to have a better chance of selling). This is in my own particular
best interests as Fence is carried by Ingram, but obviously a larger step
needs to be taken in the future. For example:

and what follows is a dreamy scenario, an idyllic scenario:

what if all journals agreed to have an exclusive contract with one
distributor (preferably a small one?) It turns out that the major reason
it's so hard for these companies to do their business is that the advent of
the huge national distributors meant that they each can get only a little
share of what is already a pretty meager pie. If all journals were
available only through one distributor (creating a monopoly of sorts) it
would be great for the publishers and for the distributor in many ways. The
distributor could actually make some money of f the journals and so
wouldn't treat us publishers like they were doing us a favor by
distributing them. Publishers could have more certainty of getting a
straight answer, good service, and fair practice from their distributor.

Anyway, if any of this makes any  sense to you (and you are a publisher of
a distributable journal, ie, one with a spine) backchannel me. There's a
lot more to talk about and report on but I don't want to take up too much
electronic airspace.

Thanks,

Rebecca Wolff
Editor/Publisher of Fence

a friend of mine here in atlanta
found a piece of notebook paper
that had blown into his yard

on the back side at the top
the word "Heres' is crossed out
and below it
is written;

"I Have a picture for you."

below this are two concentric
circles (roughly circles that is)
inside the smaller is written;

"for/ you" and then there is a drawing
that might be of several people
standing together   or it might be
several flowers   below it says;
"for/ Mother's/ Day"

outside of this circle but inside
the larger one it says "And I Love you/
Both a bunch."
at the bottom of the page is a heart-shape
and in it is written "Love"

this is all sweet and all but it is the front
side of this page that i like the best

at thetop it says, inside of pencil-drawn
rectangles; "Dina H." and "spelling test"

in the uper right corner in another rectangle
is written; "March 30, 1979"

in another hand at the top it says "-1"

this is the text of the spelling test;

1. The was hit by an ax.

2. There are Six ducks in a box.

3. Mother Maks Cakes.

4. She looks Sad.

5. He Liks my new Socks.

6. The Sticks are big.

next to the word "liks" in #5
is written a small "e"

Frost: There's a couple of pages on the Frost poem in my *Marginalization
of Poetry*, Chap 7. I do remember seeing Frost read the poem on TV when I
was 14. No great insights: sunglare prevented him from reading the pages;
Kennedy came over and stood by anxiously holding his top hat above the
page as an ineffective shield; then Frost recited "The Gift Outright."

Found: Most the words in *7 Works* come from other texts. It's now way out
of print, but about half will be reprinted in *Ten to One*, this fall.

I can't remember if Ted Berrigan's white-out novel, *Clear the Range*, has
been mentioned.  It's a pure example of finding a text inside another.

Actually it was Johnson, after taking a constitutionally-required <grin>
glance in Kennedy's direction, who stood up to help Frost, though most
people seem to remember that it was Kennedy. And yes, it was ineffectual
(an omen of things to come?...) Frost's cry for help, "I'm not having a
good light here at all," is one of the most poignant public declarations,
with its unintended subtextual meanings, ever uttered by a poet, I do
believe.

Re: Reznikoff bibliography
SAGETRIEB, vol. 11, no. 1/2, contains "The Community of Memory: A Reznikoff
Family Chronicle," by M.A. Syverson (40+ pages) and "Facing the Fifties: A
New Reznikoff Manuscript," by Robert Franciosi (10 pages).
SAGRETRIEB Vol. 13, no. 1/2 was a special Charles Reznikoff issue, almost
entirely devoted to his work.

But then, accordingly, anticipation (of audience) seems "not uncritical" and
"provocative" in itself - but of what "order", esp taken in terms of actual
responses to the provocative anticipation any "other" might be sd to be
approached with, before the fact?  I mean is there really audience
"present", or need for a speculated one, in order to respond to its supposed

Solving for x = "finding out the deal", meaning
I presume, there's meaning "in the air"?  But to what extent can this be
held to several sheets of paper?  Doesn't it simply "lift" after about ten
minutes?  And in terms of this problem, what is, and is the function of,
gravity?  It sure doesn't seem the lead pipe cinch upon wch the earth, so
they said as we were told, was centered in 1963.  What happens?  Or
'happened', to put it in human lifetime terms?

Hi--

Kevin and I will be out of town for a week beginning this Sunday (the
13th).  I know it's a little late to ask--but does anybody know anybody
who'd like to stay in our apartment in San Francisco's South of Market
district and feed two demanding cats?

Thanks.

There's still room for one or two people.  Cheap.

    Out in the swamp they made great ceremony over the mule.  They
mocked everything human in death.  Starks led off with a great eulogy on
our departed citizen, our most distinguished citizen and the grief he
left behind him, and the people loved the speech.  It made him more
solid than building the schoolhouse had done.  He stood on the distended
belly of the mule for a platform and made gestures.  When he stepped
down, they hoisted Sam up and he talked about the mule as a school
teacher first.  Then he set his hat like John Pearson and imitated his
preaching.  He spoke of the joys of mule-heaven to which the dear
brother had departed this valley of sorrow; the mule-angels flying
around; the miles of green corn and cool water, a pasture of pure bran
with a river of molasses running through it; and most glorious of all,
No Matt Bonner with plow lines and halters to come in and corrupt.  Up
there, mule-angels would have people to ride on and from his place
beside the glittering throne, the dear departed brother would look down
into hell and see the devil plowing Matt Bonner all day long in a
hell-hot sun and laying the raw-hide to his back.

COMBUNCTION


Run off sure enough, depend on you
It was mass cruelty

The dream is the truth up the road towards way off
They act and do

Words walking without masters
New ones would have to be made and said

Alphabet, don't you know
They got me up in they mouth

They got a name to gnaw on
They don't come kiss and named me names

Now they got to look into me loving
sanctum beglamored whispery wide

pearl stone palm walk switches
raped and raked and scraped

You don't even know where the ham is at
a cook-pot text on/off got

in quotation, a green and an orange
rolling in blue lacy be like the sun the day

Maybe if somebody was to show me how
words float around in thought and thought on sound

wrongside throbbing calm, lemonade swabbed
protolapsis    Ocala    crayon

The sisters got mock happy
She slept with authority in the town mind

and the town bowed down
and passed around the pictures of their thoughts

Everyone indulged in Mule Talk
The age, its disposition and his caper

passle of the world for a carcass or a canvas
Sam or Walter or some of the other

Big Picture Talkers
Some folks spelt from what she knew about

Everybody was going to the dragging-out
writing off the offending hand like a hen on a hot brick

A war of defense for helpless things
A Free Mule in town was something new to yak about

rawbony back, he almost got fat
New lies sprung up about his Free Mule doings

and the grief he left behind him
Our departed citizen, our most distinguished citizen,

speak to us of the joys of Mule Heaven,
sky of rye and a river of molasses

Here he was just pouring honor all over her
They were holding a flying-meet

way up over the heads of the mourners
and her hair was NOT going to show

It was a contest in hyperbole and carried on
She was a wind on the ocean orange grove, Post Office too

boundary 2 99 Poets/1999: An International Poetics Symposium a special
issue edited by Charles Bernstein volume 26 number 1 spring 1999 Duke
University Press ISSN 0190-3659  281 pages $12


From the introduction:
Quote  Starting in 1997, with the help of several coeditors, I asked poets
from around the world to respond to a series of interrelated questions  …
Do you see your work in the context of a national state, or in the context
of international capital, or in some other context (including imaginary or
imagined ones)? Is identity an important issue for your work, and if so, in
what senses? For me, these issues have a specific connection to the
possibilities or impossibilities for poetic language (so often identified
with specific groups, states, or classes): diction, vernacular, dialect,
sound, syntax, and so forth.
… I asked one alternative question:
What do you see as the most urgent, yet insufficiently recognized, or
addressed, issue or issues for poetry and poetics at this moment?   Unquote

These open-ended provocations resulted in a substantial resource. There's a
great deal to think about and enjoy over time, but here are some snippets
to be going on with.

Quote      I am interested in what confines each generation inside themes,
metaphors, theoretical and stylistic attitudes. I imagine the passion of
the language that is allowed to escape from this. The turbulence that
cracks open history. The desire that consumes the common places. I imagine
the interior urgency that forces the liquidation of an era's truisms.
Unquote Nicole Brossard  If this isn't inspiring, I don't know what is.

In a piece which purports to be a description of the experience of standing
at a bus stop, cris cheek seduces the reader into exploring possible ways
in which the text is being constructed, by the writer and the reader. A
kind of Heraclitean exploration in which the reader cannot dip into the
same text twice.

Seeking to learn lessons from the more adventurous spirits in advertising,
Jerome Sala writes
Quote   This is the genre of ad that you see more and more of these days
which, in order to sell its products, trashes advertising itself, and its
long history of hype. … one can't help but wonder if there isn't something
poetry could learn from this strategy devised by its prodigal sons and
daughters whom, cultural critics often argue, are squandering the riches of
their verbal inheritance in the foreign land of the commodity - that
barbarian locale to which most poets deny their citizenship). After all,
hasn't there been too much inflated hype about poetry? And haven't its own
promoters, poets and literary theorists been complicit in a sin any
advertising creative director will warn you against - that of the
"overpromise"? Does so much really depend upon a red wheelbarrow? Can it
possibly carry the weight of historical profundity you'd like to place in
it? Unquote.  A mini manifesto embodying some of these fiery proposals
follows.

Johanna Drucker has edited a visual poetry section, for which she has
written a very useful introduction. One of these, by Steve McCaffery,
struck me straightaway: a row of 20 a's, typewritten so the line isn't
quite straight, followed by same row overtyped on a row of b's followed by
same row overtyped on a row of c's and so on for 26 rows. The increasing
density of ink is extraordinarily expressive. Contrast this with the
palindromic arrangements of Alexandr Bubnov, formally beautiful in the
fascinatingly lifeless way of a periodic crystal.

Being the responses of poets they sometimes decline the more glacial
academic tones:

Quote       Present day manifestations of 'the Russian Avant Garde' seem to
me to be unconscionably conformist in their aspiration, with a ludic aim of
'arranging' a civilized hell. One may be obliged to live in hell but that
doesn't mean one has to accept it as something necessary and indisputable.
Unquote    Gennady Aygi

Quote     Spanish poetry is characterized by its lack of critical rigor its
inward-looking nature. Cesar A. Molina has described Spanish poets as a
group of whining mourners buried in their own traditionalism & social
neorealism, all the while engaging in endless navel gazing. Manuel Brito

Form and technical questions receive considerable attention.
Quote    COLLAGE, its core innovation, foreseen by Lautreamont late in the
previous one. It cut the time lines, taught us a new history, and yet is
also graft, a rearrangement of arborescent structures, trees as always
already roots / trunk / branches, even when cut and rearranged, say
branches / trunk / roots, the heavenly tree grows downward in polarities we
can no longer afford, if we ever could.  Unquote Pierre Joris.

Quote    The destitution of the essence of poetry largely results from our
excessive attention to the phenomenal part of poetry. And most of us who
are now interested in form have arrived at this interest by way of a
revision of the past, when the content was overemphasized. The art of
poetry, if standing on either side of the extremes, cannot possibly develop
in any significant way. To me, as a poet devoted to the revolution of form,
with mature conditions and enough talent, I would transcend the phenomena
of poetry and march directly toward the essence.    Unquote  Che Qianzi


Quote    By hybridising, I don't mean a mixing, or a production of a
third-party alternative from a set of specific material. A hybrid is not a
possible next stage in a developmental sense, nor a 'dilution' of the
component parts! Nor is it a fusing of traditions. It is, in fact, a
conscious undoing of the codes that constitute all possible readings of a
text. It is a debasement of the lyrical I … It recognises frames for what
they are: empty shells.    Unquote     John Kinsella

The question of translation is a living presence:
Quote   Thinking and translating are for me almost synonymous words.
Unquote Nelson Ascher

Issues of identity and politics recur, an interesting context given by
Robin Blaser.
Quote          the serious or ramshackle poet in us hasn't a chance at
being apolitical, even if the elf of his or her language wishes to be.
Unquote

Quote      There is another kind of experience I sometimes have when
reading the words of authors who never imagined that someone like me might
be included in the potential audience for their work, as when I read in
Cirlot's Dictionary of Symbols that a "Negro" symbolizes the beast in the
human. When I read words never meant for me, or anyone like me - words that
exclude me, or anyone like me, as a possible reader - then I feel
simultaneously my exclusion and my inclusion as a literate black woman, the
unimagined reader of the text.      Unquote  Harryette Mullen.

There are some very useful historical surveys, essays and mini-anthologies,
from a wide number of different countries. You'll find some idiosyncratic
(perhaps the least power centred of the 'cracies) pieces which avoid
categorisation

Quote:  Nothing for the magician is accidental / All that could possibly
happen to the magical prop is intrinsic to it and knowing "all that" (could
possibly happen) to the prop is what constitutes a magician's knowledge /
The event is the adventure of that moment     Unquote     Lyn Hejinian

What do you want  me to say? It's a huge book and I'll be reading it, with
pleasure, anger and inspiration, for years. I've omitted loads because any
time I've tried to skim through for an overview I keep sinking in one or
other entrancing contribution. Marvelous stuff.

I'm afraid I've forgotten who it was who was looking for a copy of *Total
Syntax* (the whole book, presumably)--but if you backchannel me with an
address, I can send you a decent xerox copy that I have sitting
around--not quite the real thing, I know . . .

And thanks to everyone who responded with suggestions re my "Poetry and
Pedagogy" inquiry: I'm working with a number of your ideas for poems.

"Everything is the one, the whole, to understand this is what holiness
means. It is the hoarders of the earth, who grasped the earth's flowers
like what we had been before climbing the mighty tree, and so could see
the sky, could see the sea where we had been, could look down on the
ground and declare ourselves, finally, more than it. But they who
carried the earth with them, like the dead, were buried under it, took
dirt with them, even as the women taught the rest of us, how to stand up
straight, and dig the scattered eyes of stars of the other part of our
wholeness, where surely we would go and be."

"And the world had changed. They said Pain Pain Pain, the other half of
The mask. They could have all they need but they had not learned how
to ask. Nor to bathe. That's bad they said, We Bad said we. Nature had
put on different clothes everywhere new eyes for your nose. It is our
home, not a forest but a garden. And the animals the women taught
To be with us, give us milk, and honey, and clothes and food, no longer
Must we roam the forests everyday, for a mouth full of food the only
pay."

"It must remain a mystery for a few to rule the many. For the
hundreds to rule the billions. Everything is a mystery except you got to
go to work so you can remain poor and never understand much.
Go through the world and never under stand a thing. Except you got to
go to work. Go to church all your life and never understand. It's a
fraud, a vicious joke. There is Evil and there is good, but not no God

We've had two last-minute one-year asst. professorships come open at the
University of Louisville.  3/3 load, Ph.D. and teaching experience
required, a range of undergraduate comp and lit teaching.  Letter, vita,
dossier to Debra Journet, Chair, Dept. of English, Univ. of Louisville,
Louisville, KY 40292 by 6/30.  Feel free to drop my name, as long as you
don't break it.

Lisa Samuels, whom many of you know, had one of these jobs last year and I
think was
pretty happy here.  I don't know what the salary is but the
company's charming and L'ville is a cheap
and livable city.

From Cleveland's "Events & Reviews, News for Readers from Mac's Backs
June 1999":

"Poetry Duet.  Saturday, June 12 at 7 p.m.
Last year poets Albertine Boclear and Kevin Magee gave a fine reading,
an intimate expression of their relationship with words and each other.
They will be back for an encore performance, trading poems and stories."

Some form of an introduction is in order.

In a better world, the red carpet (flag!) will be rolled out for every
writer arriving from the working class, especially for every writer
arriving by way of the Trade Unions.

Albertine Boclear returns to Mac's Backs this Saturday after 20-plus
years first as a line worker at a GE plant organized by the UAW, and
then as an operator for Ohio Bell/Ameritech organized by the CWA.

Born and raised in Cleveland, Albertine started writing several years
ago after enrolling in Capital University's Adult Education Program
here, and is currently working on a first book of poems and a first book
of short stories.  As a teenager, after hearing his Ballot or the Bullet
Speech, she walked up to Malcolm X standing with a few supporters on the
sidewalk in a once-Muslim district of Cleveland, who held her hand for a
moment and asked her about herself; she served one year in the Breakfast
for Children auxillary of the Black Panthers; and then raised three
children of her own.

Will Alexander's crucial intervention at the 1993 New Coast Conference
i.e., "Why aren't there any women of color here?" echoed by Renee
Gladman at the Page Mamas, as reported by Kevin Killian, on the subject
of anthologies and minorities and representation (it's not about
affirmative action, but social justice), are not addressed perhaps as
much at the organizers of conferences and editors of anthologies as they
are at the larger (tremendous) problem of institutional frameworks like
the University reflected recently on this list in a passing
(symptomatic) reference by a bourgeois feminist i.e., "I don't mean to
rehearse Poetry 101 here."

As if Poetry 101 were a space that could be taken for granted.  As if
everyone who arrives at the Art of Poetry has the privilege to register
for Poetry 101.

Class dynamics.  The essays by Lorenzo Thomas and Maria Damon in CLOSE
LISTENING provide important counter-positions to the problems posed by
the space called Poetry 101.  What powerful social and economic
mechanisms dictate who gets to sit in what precious space whether called
workshop or art school.

Albertine as I'm leaving (re Event Note:  Transcendental Friend's First
Anniversary), "I've got feelings too."

ALTAR
    for Stephen Jonas

She
that morning star so unlike
those that sovereign the night
slumps
against stone whiteness
inlaid with glass blocks.
Her faith as wide and firm
all day she lives on them
from a coarse hewn weather grained
leather used hued smooth valise
wrapped in a tatty shawl.
Diaphanous gauze against chrome air.
Hyacinths melt in her hand
flowerings from 8 summers ago
of late May rain.

Continues hallucinated even though
she looked full upon him blue dry and hissing
each syllable erect unripe fruit firm
and tastes the last supper
memory in her mouth weight as a garment
vigils for the next breaking of bread.

With gilded face cleft by cleft
beneath a touch of plumped toque astray
beneath a touch of paisley round her neck
comes solemnly to the well.
Each sun's revolution defines this phase
no different than the rest holds hope.
I mumble to myself on paper    mute.
She to herself on street corners    articulate.
Dialogues    diverse dialects    between me and She.

Albertine Boclear

The full version of my web-poem, along with much new material (two full
Saroyan books, Hausmann sound files, etc.), is now at Kenneth Goldsmith's
ubu site, which can be reached at:

http://www.ubu.com

There are some problems with the html which make it look pretty horrible on
a Mac, and until we get this fixed, Mac users can check out the full
version at:

http://www.bway.net/~arras

Some notes:
     -- only 4.0+ browsers will be able to get through the full version as
some of the javascripts will not work (I haven't had the time or resources
to debug on all browsers, and not even sure if they will work on 3.0)
     -- if you are running a 4.0+ browser and get a script error, then the
files (most likely the images) haven't fully downloaded; let the files
finish and then inter-activate
     -- remember that the files are cached, so you can look at it again
later at a much quicker speed (provided you don't clear you cache)
     -- there are some embedded tricks in the pages, such as
mouse-activated java poems, clickable areas in the images and text masses,
etc., that you should watch out for, but don't crazy with it -- if
nothing's happening, then nothing's there (hint: the black dots always work
eventually)
     -- re: "Atlanta", I take what appears a dig at Atlanta, but I really
do like what's happening there, the poetry group and the ideas; read the
"Credits" page to gather what I mean

The poem is dedicated to Kenny and Cheryl's new baby, Finnegan Francis
Donegan Goldsmith, born this past Friday, May 29th.

Steven Farmer  _Medieval_
128 pages, $9, ISBN 1-928650-00-7
"The real deal, Steven Farmer's poetry has been read and listened to
closely with delight by other California poets for at least 17 years. A
major book is long, long overdue. He has a superb Western ear, a classic
sense of line and stanza, a subtle mind that knows precisely what it sees
and understands (and, even more rare, the ability to articulate that which
it cannot) and a wry wit that makes it very difficult indeed to read these
pages without a smile. The balance and turns in these poems makes me dizzy
with envy."  -Ron Silliman

Dan Farrell  _Last Instance_
61 pages, $9, ISBN 1-928650-01-5
"In Last Instance, Dan Farrell poses the relations between social
reproduction and expression through stuttered and sutured acts of
composition. His historically located and disclosed forms clash and mingle
with social evidence, instigating transpositions at the level of the
letter, syntactical order, and semantic sensibility. Rather than hailing
the ruse of subjective plenitude and unfettered expressivity, his
compositions rely on perlocutionary acts engaging language in its
nonreferential capacity to elicit and provoke action and response."
-Nancy Shaw

Elizabeth Fodaski  _fracas_
78 pages, $9, ISBN 1-928650-02-3
"Elizabeth Fodaski's fracas grabs attention, then holds, examines, and
explodes the  attentions it attracts. This work is both elegant and
playful, sardonic and amused. A din, a brawl, a noisy quarrel. It
instructs, implores, and navigates a level of writerly inquiry that's a joy
to encounter. From the heady, generative tumble of "Flood Watching" to the
studied and gorgeous language of "Paper Daybreak" and "ETYMOLOGIES," fracas
rocks."   -Jessica Grim

P. Inman  _at. least._
102 pages, $9, ISBN 1-928650-03-1
"Hardly anything seems strange enough anymore- "reality. as. a. normative.
effect," -at least P. Inman still works the front lines. With evidence
shimmer, no things but in letters & space & punctuation, politically paying
off perforation. This arranges tantalizing raw (& V-effected) materials for
us to construct (& live in) a life, a milieu. With zero bluster- "language.
larger" -contra code everywhere, a clip-o-matic audacity & atomic redlining
to thrill. . . . Not to complacently cooperate with a fetish or impress
with imagery & optic sugaring, not to wield massageish 'content' to
represent something already built, an institutionalized titanic humanizing
the pin-ups or invoice behavior as contentment as containment. The already
is uninhabitable. Let's de boss!"   -Bruce Andrews

Does anyone have or know where to find a program called DIASTEXT?

It implements a form of Mac Low's diastic text generation. I had a copy of
it years ago, didn't transfer it to the new machine, and have (thus) lost
it. Checking my usual net places to find such things hasn't turned it up.

Thank you in advance for any help.

There's a diagram of the serial poem in the back of the Collected Books of
Jack Spicer edited by Robin Blaser p.358. It's part of the questionaire for
Robert Duncan's workshop in Basic Techniques. Blaser says Spicer chose the
spiral rather than the hierarchy when he came to answer for the "tree or
Contellation" of poetry

In a recently published article by Annie Proulx, she is quoted as saying:
.
"I rarely use the internet for research, as I find the process cumbersome
and detestable. The information gained is often untrustworthy and couched in
execrable prose. It is unpleasant to sit in front of a twitching screen
suffering assault by virus, power outage, sluggish searches, system crashes
and the lack of direct human discourse."
.
I quite enjoyed this odd view of the internet and wondered if I could sell
her some I.T. consultancy. Also I was entertained by the idea of power
outages occurring, to such an extent that one could not complete a web
search.
.
Everything else looks exaggerated to me, but I can only go on my experience
of electrical supply in Europe. Serious question: to what degree is power
outage a problem in America?. I don't know where she is based, but I hadn't
thought that it was much of a problem in normal times i.e. outside of major
storms and occasional accidents. But it would be useful to me because of
something related I am looking into to know for sure. Tell me, this is
largely junk, isn't it?

_Beneath a Single Moon: Buddhism in Contemporary American Poetry_,
ed. by Kent Johnson and Craig Paulenich, will soon be put back into
print by Shambhala. The book will be available for order through
the press and all major on-line sellers.

The book carries an introductory essay by Gary Snyder. Among the 45
poets included (most entries come accompanied by an essay): Steve
Benson, Olga Broumas, John Cage, Alan Davies, Diane di Prima, Norman
Fischer, Margaret Gibson, Allen Ginsberg, Susan Griffin, Sam Hamill,
Jim Harrison, Michael Heller, Jane Hirshfield, Robert Kelly, Jackson
Mac Low, George Quasha, Jed Rasula, Leslie Scalapino, Andrew
Schelling, Armand Schwerner, Gary Snyder, Charles Stein, Lucien
Stryk, Nathaniel Tarn, Anne Waldman, Philip Whalen.
------------------
"Beneath a Single Moon makes for startling reading: it provides
incontrovertible evidence as to the strength and richness of Buddhist
thought, and especially of Buddhist practice, in contemporary
American poetry. Our Buddhist poets, like Buddhism itself, are by no
means all of a piece; it is their range and variety that is
especially impressive. the individual essays by the poets themselves
are especially helpful. This is an outstanding, scholarly anthology
that should have wide readership." --Marjorie Perloff

"This intelligent anthology provides compelling evidence of a
continuing preoccupation in American thought, from Emerson, Thoreau,
and Whitman to the poets here represented. It is the human search for
a locating home, transcendent yet literal, always here even if
nowhere. The complexly common voices of these writers are an
insistent call to our own need, to let go of our 'lives' and so live
them."--Robert Creeley

"Vivid, diverse, multitudinous-- the poems gathered herein are both
evidence and celebration of the wild flowering of Buddhism in
America. A splendid collection."--Rick Fields, author of _How the
Swans Came to the Lake: A History of Buddhism in America_

"We needed an extensive survey of the influence of Buddhism in
contemporary American poetry, and this anthology generously fills
that need."--Wendell Berry

Ron (and all),

Charles O. Hartman, author of DIASTEXT, has a web page at
www.conncoll.edu/ccother/cohar. Last time I checked, the page had some free
computer poetry software available for download, including a fairly
interesting and easily hackable C program called MacProse - but it didn't
include DIASTEXT. Unfortunately, I can't verify this right now, since either
Hartman's page or the Microschlock browser they've saddled me with at work
seems to be malfunctioning.
(oh, never mind, just found the new URL:
http://camel.conncoll.edu/ccother/cohar/programs/ )

McPoet 5.0 (this is my favorite of the bunch, as its parameters are
configurable without having to get into the actual code - takes a little
work, and the default settings are pretty silly, but well worth a look):

Note that Robopoet, Mark V. Chaney and Babble are DOS programs. MacProse,
Deconstructor, Text Mangler, and McPoet are for the Mac. Sorry I couldn't
find DIASTEXT for you (though the basic procedure would be fairly easy to
code in either C++ or VBA for Word), but perhaps one or two of these will be
of some interest. Keep me informed, too, if you find DIASTEXT anywhere.

Does anyone have or know where to find a program called DIASTEXT?

It implements a form of Mac Low's diastic text generation. I had a copy of
it years ago, didn't transfer it to the new machine, and have (thus) lost
it. Checking my usual net places to find such things hasn't turned it up.

Thank you in advance for any help.

Subject:      reply to Upton, RE : power outages

Here in San Francisco we have  local outages 2-3 times per year when
neighborhhood transformers blow.   We also have frequent blown fuses because
the old apartment buildings and Victorians are riddled with old bad wiring
and overloaded circuits.
In addition to this we sometimes have dirty wiring, circuits in which the
ground wire
picks up a slight low voltage current which produces a buzz on the radio and
sometimes
a slight shock in the bathtub (circuits are grounded to cold water pipes).
Presumably, the dirty circuits can decrease the lives of appliances. To
guard against outages, I use an APC power conversion unit on my computer,
which keeps it going about fifteen or twenty minutes when the power's blown.
Another small problem to consider is telephone
outages,  which sometimes happen when rain gets into the unprotected outdoor
junction
boxes.    All this aside, it's good to remember that libraries shut down
too, all night, every night.  And if your doing your research in a library,
you'll probably use the Online Public
Access Catalog to find your material, rather than "direct human discourse",
which is
usually discouraged anyway by stern librarians, who will glare at you while
pointing to the sign on the wall that says, "No direct human discourse,
please."

Mouthing Lives, Whew!


"--and when I first read Kierkegaard, I said, 'My God! He's on to some-
thing very crucial for me,' which was, how do you actually engage in forms
of philosophical reflection that are inseparable from lived experience and
concrete situations?" (Cornel West interview in The Harvard Review of
Philosophy, Spring 1999.)

If the forms were living, they might be Nikuko and Alan; if Nikuko and
Alan were living. If Nikuko has the concrete situations, measurable in
terms of quota and specificity, Alan has the lived experience; if Nikuko
occupies the realm of the definable, Alan occupies that of immersivity.

If Nikuko constructs, Alan names; Nikuko and Alan meet at the junction of
the appellation: "In uttering an 'Appellation' we wish to remove any
doubts as to the actual meaning. But, how can we utter an appellation?--
With our mouth." (From the Canon, Mo Tzu, in The Works of Kung-Sun Lung-
Tzu, Perleberg.)

The juncture is the juncture of the mouth. A paradox from Chuang-tzu 33:
"Mountains bring out mouths." First image: that of the mountain; second
image: that of bringing-forth (mountain upon mountain, pictorially [not in
terms of origin]); third image: that of a square, mouth: delimitation.
"The empty valley transmits sounds" or echos. A fissure in the earth reso-
nates. One translation states "mountains have mouths" but this overlooks
the impulse behind the exodus. It is the process of the flesh in the real,
or the overture of the real to speech. The valley unfolds like great dark
lips; the momentum of the tongue garners the bewilderment of naming.

The second image, doubled mountain, ch'u, to go forth or out, issue, be-
get, eject. "Primitively it represents stalks growing out of the ground."
(Ingram's old Analysis of Chinese Characters.) "is a hieroglyphic charac-
ter representing the foot protruding past a certain line." (The First Step
to Kanji, Yoshida, Saji, Nishida.) Growing transforms into the issuing of
symbols; the symbolic pours from the mouth as in Mayan glyphics. The mouth
(of the stream, of the valley, of speech and the symbolic, of the graphic
user interface, of the screen) is the suture between Nikuko and Alan; it
is the mouth which speaks both subject and avatar into existence.

The oath that the mouth makes is the binding of the performative into eth-
os; and it is among oaths that ethos is born. "We meet at the juncture of
the appellation; mouth and name remain indecipherable, indistinguishable."

I think of tattoo: My desire for your name, Nikuko, upon me, your sign,
Nikuko, engraved in hanko as well, covering pages and skin with kisses.
"Qu: 'Does two include one?' Kung: 'Two does not include one?'" yet it is
pointed out, in the original, it is not clear who is speaking. (T'ung-
pien lun, Kung-Sun Lung-Tzu.) Mouth and name, tattoo and number, sign and
quantity. One is never a quantity. One is always a quantity, measure from
the origin, convenient backdrop to the continuum, signifier of measure
polytopes. We are close to the work of Lingis here, or the full and re-
plete body supine in the valley, symbolic and riverine flows throughout.

Later, everything was born. "Love, love, love, have the courage to love,
the courage to be, go down fighting. Whew!" (West.)

Thanks to all who responded to my enquiry about power outages etc, both

Book Review: Shredding the Tapestry of Meaning – The Poetry and
Poetics of Kitasono Katue (1901–1978) , by John Solt, Published by the
Harvard University Asia Center and distributed by Harvard University
Press, 1999, 395 pages, $49.50 cloth, ISBN 0-674-80733-2. (Available
on amazon.com)

Occasionally a book arrives that changes everything. Less, perhaps, in
presenting something totally new, than in revealing that which had
remained hidden, or forgotten. John Solt’s biography and extended
literary analysis of the life’s work of Kitasono Katue, a major
practitioner of avant-garde poetic forms from the 1920s to the 1970s,
does just that. First in offering up the newest in that short list of
very rare full-length studies of a modern Japanese poet, and second in
its having laid open a forgotten history of dynamic artistic and
literary development, as well as cultural exchange. A history,
moreover, which intersects with our own, as becomes evident in the
lengthy chapter on Kitasono’s many years of correspondence with Ezra
Pound.

Kitasono Katue (Solt uses the Francophile spelling preferred by
Kitasono himself in his dealings with foreign poets) originally wanted
to become a painter, but after a literary friendship and time spent in
Tokyo, broiling with new ideas and a cosmopolitan lifestyle (Hirato
Renkichi published his Japanese Futurist manifesto in 1921), Kitasono
decided to become a poet. By 1924 he had become involved with a group
of young poets publishing Japan’s first Dadaist magazine,
Ge.Gjmgjgam.Prrr.Gjmgem , thus beginning his many years of involvement
with iconoclastic new forms. The new magazine introduced sound poems,
dadaist absurdities and work harkening the eventual development of
Surrealism in Japan. One more very important characteristic of the
magazine was the introduction of the usage of katakana words in
poetry. Foreign words and images were used liberally, appearing both
in katakana script and the alphabet. We tend to be non-plussed now
about these graphical innovations due to the common use of foreign
loan words and Romanized script in the Japanese of the present, but at
that time it was revolutionary, and would even become dangerous by the
late 1930’s with the rise of militarism.

Kitasono went on to write Surrealist poems, such as appear in his 1929
collection Shiro no Arubamu , and in the 1930’s became the main mover
of the VOU club, an experimental group through which he introduced his
own poetic theories such as “ideoplasty”. It was at this time the
correspondence with Pound began, and Pound eagerly promoted Kitasono
and VOU in Europe and the United States, connecting Kitasono’s
ideoplasty with his own ideogrammatic theory in Guide to Kulchur
(1938). The VOU poets were given an introduction by Pound and
published in a London magazine in 1938. Kitasono provided his own
translations of his work, a few lines of which appear below:

  In leaden slippers I laugh at the fountain of night, and scorn
       a solitary swan.
  A parasol of glass she spreads, and wanders along the lane the
       cosmos flowering.
  Over the cypress tree I image, to myself, a hotel marked with
       two golf-clubs crossed;
  And move my camera on the sand of night.

   [Excerpt from “Glass Coil” as originally published in Townsman,
Jan. 1, 1938]

Kitasono carried out intensive exchanges with Pound and other Western
poets during this period, and remade contact with the West after the
war in the form of contacts with Charles Olson, Robert Creeley,
Kenneth Rexroth and others. Robert Creeley even asked him to provide
the cover drawings for the first few issues of the Black Mountain
Review .

Rather than settling on one fixed form once found, as has been the
case with many Japanese poets of the same period (including those who
later lapsed into free-verse sentimentalism after an initial
experimental phase), Kitasono went from one experiment to the next.
After the war he introduced concrete poetry, then published a series
of books each taking a further step toward the complete dislocation
(or indeterminacy) of meaning, and finally attempted the leap beyond
language itself in his production of what he called “plastic poems”,
poems without words in which he utilized photography and design
elements. Kitasono can almost be considered Japan’s first
Post-Modernist in his willful ignoring of the boundaries between
genres, levels of speech, and conventional meaning formation.

Solt explains in his introduction that his approach is a historical
one, rather than one whose purpose is to advocate any particular
literary theory, however, he does make use of the ideas of important
theorists on the international 20th century avant-garde such as
Marjorie Perloff, especially in his interpretations of Kitasono’s
post-war work. More importantly, Solt’s study offers an exposition of
Japanese avant-garde practice through much of this century which
serves to tear away the imposition of Western generated Orientalist
exoticisms often overlaid on the more immediate intellectual and
social realities of Japan. The representation of Japanese literature
in this country has often been effected by those more concerned with
appropriating an overly idealized version of Zen and haiku for their
own ideological purposes within a social and political milieu very
different from Japan’s than in understanding the actual historical
experience of a non-Western people in their coming to terms with the
ideas and realities of their own times. Solt’s book gives us one of
the rare looks at actual Japanese concerns within the poetic practice
of the 20th century through the eyes of a Japanese poet, hence giving
us a much needed breath of fresh air. The appendices, notes and
bibliography give the serious reader important source information for
further study. It is hoped that this will open the way to more
research on the development of Japanese poetic practice, as well as
other Japanese arts and intellectual trends of this century. It seems
to me that there is much more creative potential for poets in this
country in the consideration of the transformational processes
involved in this period of intensive cultural cross-pollination, in
the various acts of translation, literary readings and creative
misreadings, than in the continued reliance on older, and often
artificially exotic images invented by previous generations of
Westerners with less of an opportunity to come into contact with the
real thing.

"I was wondering if you'd be so kind to explain" arrives by backchannel
raising such a complex set of issues and from such an unexpected
direction (East instead of West) that the form of response I would
choose is the public one of an open letter translating one poet's
directness and generalizing his earnest suspicion by substituting the
simple candor of a private answer for the more difficult, for me anyway,
task of reflecting on my experience of the Buffalo Poetics List since
the last week of February of this year and the nature of my
participation on it, employing the method of self-critique you can find
in The Bolivian Diary, for example, at the end of each month's entries,
or Shades of Hades:

Out of the items in the New York Times
a woman, one of the leaders of the FMLN
reported wounded and captured.

In her papers,
evidence she had been to study in Hanoi,
love poems, a diary, and a self-critique.

Questions:

1) Do I identify groups and call them pampered elitist?
2) Am I campaigning for cultural democracy?
3) Do my forms of propaganda include put-downs of those who I don't
think have a right to make art or do things as I think they should?
4) Does my campaign, my game, include careful non-response to those on
my enemies list?
5) Is the Buffalo Poetics List pasteurized?

Before addressing each question with the seriousness each deserves, and
I don't think I'm omitting any concern stated in a two-paragraph post,
my first thought is one of being called to a thought I almost didn't
have or at least did not give much thought to before being called to
these questions, that the bleachers in the stadium are far from empty,
though in my own private Ohio the idea that anyone is listening suffers
under force of a concentration on a single face.  I forget this while
writing for that one or for at least a few even when making the most
general statements, though there's always the thrill of being
overheard.  The magic of this form of exchange, keyboard to screen to
send, is that encourages impulsive behavior, and provokes the best kind
of reactions.  Communication.  Providing that you've got somewhere to
send it to.

1).  Group identification.  Elitism.  The only grouping I'm aware of
doing has been in a couple of event notes when I hopped on the bus to
New York and heard poetry for the first time in several years, at the
Dactyl Foundation, The Whitney, and the No Moore.  Casual groupings,
who's reading, what they read, what is the space the readings take place
in--impressions.  Impressions, perhaps, from something like a crocodile
surfacing in a log jam, to paraphrase a line or two from Prevallet's
Cocteau translation in a recent issue of TF.  The only grouping I'm
committed to, however, is the effort to keep articulating class
divisions and identifying as specifically as possible how these
divisions affect poetry, poetry spaces, and relations between poets.
This is such a huge and urgent problem that any one person trying to
address any aspect of it is bound to overstate their case, exaggerate,
expostulate, and even step on a few toes.  Something Anthony Braxton
wrote a long time back in an out-of-print three-volume opus of
post-Ayler jazz theory makes sense here:  There can be no room for
accusation if the writing is concerned about what is really true (to
refrain from attacking individuals) (even when an attack would clarify a
viewpoint) (not to mention that the state of the Art is not about only
one or two).  (I may have changed a few words, but the core is
Braxton's).  He writes elsewhere about how Western inquiry terms,
Western definitions, and the simulacra of Western textual commentary
have influenced how we have come to either approach living, or approach
understanding about living.  There's something of this in Lorenzo
Thomas' Neon Griot essay when he writes about the Black Arts Movement
and role of the neighborhood center/performance space/gallery/school as
an alternative or at least supplement to University.  If I criticize
University, a monolithic-heterogenous "elsewhere" more than capable of
defending itself, it is with the thought that I'm writing to a forum
made available from University resources, though its moderator is
probably not a member of the Communication Workers of America, and
shouldn't he be?  I also trust that the moderator would bounce any
message from me that attacked anyone personally, though what constitutes
"attack" is also class-determined.  In SF Dodie Bellamy once swiped my
face like a Yukon grizzly on the question of the conflict between Style
and Ideology, and her point made an impact on me because of its
ferocity.  Charging me, she changed my mind.  Two working class writers
communicating.

2).  The campaign for cultural democracy.  One poet cannot carry on a
campaign.  If this could be a campaign, or a Social Movement, many poets
rich and poor would have to be involved, integrating progressive
university and art school centers with inner city neighborhood
initiatives, arranging residencies, maybe doing something like the John
Reed clubs did in the 30s only this time without the CP, bringing people
into the Art of Poetry or bringing the Art of Poetry to people at a time
when the closing of that 1945-1974 higher education window of
opportunity Silliman wrote about without irony in that ironwood shared
file area years ago, i.e. "the vast extension of post-secondary
education to new sectors of society," has produced an ocean of working
class youth who do not come to culture and poetry the way my generation
mostly came to it, through that highly competitive and problematic space
of the University Writing Workshop such as Maria Damon writes about in
her Dissonance essay.  Perhaps the fervor or fever with which I press
this point in some of my posts at times has to do with the fact that I'm
haunted or hunted by the shadow of Tishie Ann who grew up a couple of
blocks away coming to writing in much the same way as the slam-woman in
Damon's essay, coming to writing through the 12 steps, bursting onto the
page and exploding our conceptions of what is literature.

3).  My forms of propaganda.  Who has the right to write.  I really
thought I was posting more poems than anything on this list, the event
notes being highly subjective snapshots saying more about the blindness
of their photographer or the gropingness of his coming to eyelight after
a three year period in the darkroom.  Writing poetry is a form of
propaganda for me, taking propaganda to mean what it means to left
politics, what you do when there's no mass work going on, shouting on a
soapbox that something is rotten in the state of the art, though every
agitator would rather be leading a shutdown or strike than talking to
the air.  Like most discourse on the left, the circulation of my writing
is extremely limited, and as far as I know only about 25 copies of my
second book, Recent Events, have been distributed through a single
bookstore in California.  As far as having the right to write, I work
with working class and inner city "students" who have barely been given
the right to live, let alone write, and the daily experience of the
silence and powerlessness inflicted on them and which they bear with
amazing humor colors my propaganda, but I don't know where I'd get the
power to say who does or doesn't have the right to write even if I
wanted to and though I may in fact imply this from time to time in a
Blakean crank moment.

4).  My campaign.  My game.  My non-response.  A small number of poets
both known and unknown to me have backchannelled me since March, and
I've left most go unanswered, not out of a wish to have the last word,
but genuine fear of private correspondence.  Writing in a public space
means you have witnesses.  Anyone whose life has been the subject of
intense scrutiny and interrogation and whose character has been called
into question can understand the security of this space where whatever I
say may be used against me, but there's a chance that one or two might
agree with me, and those encouraging and supportive backchannels in
particular over the last several months have helped me remain confident
that the general impulsiveness of my formulations or forms of propaganda
include a breath of fresh air, even if I lapse into occasional instances
of "Kevinosis / Mageeosis" which warning appeared in the control
settings of my email account the morning after my TF event note.  I
can't think of any poet as an enemy when the real enemies of the Art of
Poetry have been bombing Belgrade.  Nietzsche once wrote that it's
important to be able to be an enemy.  Poetry is not a baseball game.  I
hate the Cleveland Indians.  The faces that fill that stadium come with
well-padded wallets from out of town.  The friend whose words I
associate with leaving for the TF event or associate with leaving
Cleveland can't even smoke a cigarette outside her office building a
block away from the Jake on game days without some Wahoo asking her how
much, 50 bucks?  I am writing for my life.  Or each poem feels burned
out of me at this intensity.

5).  The Buffalo Poetics List and the Land of Milk and Honey.  The most
curious thing is that I find it hard to imagine that a Cleveland writer
I'd never met and whose newspaper once included a review (among a
hundred other reviews) dismissing my Leaves Books chapbook would call me
up one day out of the blue and offer to email me information about
joining this list.  He said it was a great place for event and
publication announcements.  All I'd ever heard about it was several
years ago viz. "G___'s metaphor of Jacking-Off for male-dominated
discussions of poetics on the Internet" (Ruby Slippers, Detours 2).
There was some discussion of pissing contests some months previous
between fathers and sons, but what really surprised me and inspired me
and moved me into an intense on-going period of creativity has been a
kind of thunderbolt throwing match among Olympians posting under
nom-de-guerres and bringing me back to a state of agitation and
excitability strongly reminiscent of the original power transfers that
once lit the night skies over Poe's City by the Sea.  I have an idea of
who I have to thank for bringing me out of my cave, believing in the
hermit of Burning Creek who lives there, and it needs to be recognized
how great a risk it was for that person, a guardian presence, waking me
up, with no assurance except perhaps for the proofs of a few poems that
I was working or capable of working at the level I was doing in the
vicinity of 24th and Guerrero 1991-1995.  Given this, it is quite
possible that I enjoy some protection in this space which I entered with
greetings from Monica Lewinsky, Levine's Swine Sign, and St. Liz.  This
is the genius of the nom-de-guerre, you think you recognize the
innuendoes, but you can't dwell on them, or else you get drawn into a
game that resembles 50s era Soviet psychiatry:  You're just imagining
things.  Nothing is real.  "We're all dead out here."  At its hottest,
this list feels like a wide open notebook where strong poets with thick
skins compose furiously oblivious to whoever's looking or if you do look
before deleting, you might learn a thing or two.  I study every post
from Pompeii as if I were dissecting a ray of light from some social
reality far away in another galaxy.

Anyway, I hope these sentences have answered the questions submitted to
me by someone who has been made angry or at least suspicious by some
things I have written on this list.  I was really disturbed by R. Wolf's
apology "okay I'll shut up now" or something to that effect sometime
back on the question of class and how all this sucks.  Or how the future
will suck.  I didn't agree with her, but I wanted to hear her continue
her train of thought.

"Women's writing" - an interesting view
or who was loyal and how is betrayer?

Yesterday, June 12, 1999, in main official daily newspaper, within regular
Cultural Supplement, a text titled "Women's Writing", put under quotation
marks, by a locally important journalist appeared. Here are some extracts:

"The fact is: every NATO hawk-general was 'mother Mara' in comparison to
feminists!
      Because - let, start from here - almost all feminists supported
aggression against Yugoslavia. By doing this, they confirmed - do they -
their specificity inside the international community of intellectuals.
Among those who passionately plead for "final solution"  were even Serbian
women, as well as those who are married to Serbs. The names are not
important.
      What feminist pro "destruction" of this part of Balkan make
distinguished - and important - is that only they in their "war discourse"
operate with the factor of collective guilty.
(...)
     Why feminists hate Serbs? Who said this? It is only as if their
(feminist) belief in collective guilty justifies (their) plead for more
bombs per one head of local citizens.
(...)
      It is difficult to see any difference between the pro femina moral
excuse for unique humanitarian catastrophe, that is, as they say, provoked
by collective guilty of whole Serbian people, (...) We all know how their
orgy finished. And we know the horrifying price of "feminist's" obsession."

commentary:
Mara - short of Marija
newspapers are printed in cyrillic letters (which is traditional Serbian
letters), and pro and pro femina are written in latin letters. during last
9 years there was the difference between oppositional and official print.
almost all official presses or magazines for culture are in cyrillic
letters, and oppositional in latin. but besides political reasons, there is
another, practical, reason - that latinic is readable in all part of former
Yugoslavia, and these connections are important for some of us...
'pro femina' magazine become symbol of feminisam in Serbia - interesting...

     In response to your question: to what degree is power outage a problem
     in America?  That depends upon the area.  Some cities are wired above
     ground, which makes them more prone to power outtages during storms or
     high winds.  Here in Atlanta, it can happen frequently during the
     summer.  However, you shouldn't be using the computer during a severe
     storm, so perhaps it's just the wiring in Ms. Proulx's building.

     Re: search engines.  I've made good use of Infoseek's Express product,
     which I believe can still be downloaded free from the Infoseek site.  It
     simultaneously searches a combination of available search engines and
     reports back the results quickly (usually within 20 seconds or less) with a
     summary.  I use it for research at work, and have found that it provides a
     much more complete listing than using a single search engine at a time.  My
     only complaint is that there is no real advanced search criteria on
     Express, which means ocassionally scanning through a lot of useless links

     advanced search functionality, because otherwise it's an effective tool.

In a recently published article by Annie Proulx, she is quoted as
 saying:
.
"I rarely use the internet for research, as I find the process cumbersome and
detestable. The information gained is often untrustworthy and couched in
execrable prose. It is unpleasant to sit in front of a twitching screen
suffering assault by virus, power outage, sluggish searches, system crashes
and the lack of direct human discourse."
.
I quite enjoyed this odd view of the internet and wondered if I could sell
her some I.T. consultancy. Also I was entertained by the idea of power
outages occurring, to such an extent that one could not complete a web
search.
.
Everything else looks exaggerated to me, but I can only go on my experience
of electrical supply in Europe. Serious question: to what degree is power
outage a problem in America?. I don't know where she is based, but I hadn't
thought that it was much of a problem in normal times i.e. outside of major
storms and occasional accidents. But it would be useful to me because of
something related I am looking into to know for sure. Tell me, this is
largely junk, isn't it?

Hello All,
Robin Tremblay-McGaw and I have gotten some inquiries as
to whether men are "eligible" to participate in the class
& poetics forum which we are hosting/editing for HOW2. The
answer is "yes"! (Any and all genders are allowed in our
tree house.)

I've also gotten some interesting backchannel email from
"non-academics" who believe that they can't participate
because they have "nothing" to say. Believe me, you have
something to say. Your email proves that you have
something to say.

Here again is the call for responses. Please feel free to
contact me with any questions.
Kathy Lou Schultz (kathylou@worldnet.att.net)

Call for Submissions to HOW2's Forum on Class and Poetics

Visit HOW2 at:
http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/stadler_center/how2/
index.html

Thanks to the efforts of feminist poets, critics, and
editors, it is now possible to identify a discourse--both
scholarly and creative--of gender and poetics. In the
1980s, journals such as HOW(ever) put the spotlight on
these issues, particularly related to innovative or
experimental practices and how these intersected with
issues of publication, erasure, and canon formation.

A decade later, we find ourselves trying to define a
vocabulary for  addressing complex issues of class in the
formation of an innovative poetics.  As Kathy Lou Schultz
asked in her Tripwire (Issue 1, Fall 1998) essay, "What's
a working class poetic, and where could I find one?"  How
do we make present the _absence_ of class in discussions
of gender and the poetics of innovation?  Where are the
intersections of race in discussions of class?  How are
these forces fused and CON-fused?

How do/can we picture/trace working class issues in
formally innovative ways?  What do the circumstances of
literary production--surrounding writers and the writing
produced--have to do with one another?

Submissions should be emailed to: robinandkathy@tf.org by
July 7th and be no longer than 2 paragraphs.  We will
select and edit responses.

Editors: Kathy Lou Schultz and Robin Tremblay-McGaw

        Sorry, Masha, to have neglected Russia. Our stats
        are generated automatically by the listserv program,
        which, as one might expect of software from the U.S.,
        is quietly imperialistic; any domain that does not
        end in a country code [e.g., CA for Canada] is treated
        by the program as a U.S. territory.

                cheers, Chris

no soldier here. I'm listening to Grateful Dead, as it happens. I don't feel
nostalgic as I hear it, so I guess it's okay. here is one place: I idolize
music. but I have to write. I *infer* this, because I have done so, written,
seriously since I was sixteen. I have been published once in that time, when
a teacher, Robert Grenier, threw me into This3. mountains of the moon, dark
star, etc. is publishing important? stumbling onto this list soon after
getting Internet access opened doors to what seems nostalgic just as this
old music (1969) could seem so. poetry as a sort of identity. I note a
community or communication here, a provoked and provoking insistence to
consider? something like that. it's been good. I've been on an  island for
years, tho I bought what books and mags I could (now can't). time for a
swim. the questions were asked, before I could join here: what do you expect
to give and what to get? jeez, I sweated them (did you?) but in the end I
effectively signed a document saying this is capital P Poetry I'm interested
in. you know, some feasibly modern White Goddess um rite or how you will
have it. this isn't casual for me and, incompetent tho I may be, it never
has been. face it: writing is easy. words are plentiful, the hand-eye thing
with pen or keyboard can be mastered, just take some time to do it. boiling
the commodity out, the career out, these having always been tripping points
for me. Kevin (first name's okay?) used the word 'propaganda', which scares
me. I mean the word does, or what I understand the word to carry. not for
his politics but for what I bring. I mean that I'd be writing Walt Whitman
crap, dilating to beat the band, if I didn't watch it, and I'm not all that
enamoured of ole Walt to begin with. I'm speaking here because. well, the
energy of the opportunity commits me? or I wanted Kevin (real Kevin,
imagined one) to know that I'm across the street, scratching my head, maybe,
but waving also. I say the same to everyone. I've felt some useful
irritations. I don't want to argue, just once in a while pin something on
the wall. yes, and confront these strange juxtapositions. Poetry doesn't
need me, but I guess I need to need it. interesting, isn't it? that's what I
'm saying. AHB

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

The Poetics List was founded by Charles Bernstein in late 1993
with the epigraph above. Now in its second incarnation, the list
carries over 600 subscribers, though all of these subscribers do
not necessarily receive messages at any given time. A number of
other people read the Poetics List via our web archives at the
Electronic Poetry Center (see section 9 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. Due to the
increasing number of subscribers, we are no longer able to
maintain the open format with which the list began. All
submissions are reviewed by the moderator in keeping with
the goals of the list, as articulated in this Welcome Message.
We remain committed to this editorial function as a defining
element of the Poetics List. Our aim is to support, inform,
and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to
innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as
content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and
to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 5
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 10.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 7
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the editors, write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your real name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list must provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all of
the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, simply re-subscribe to the list
(once your account problem has been resolved!) by sending
this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Submissions

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. All submissions
are reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the
list as articulated in this Welcome Message (see section 1).
Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetics, messages relating to politics and political news or
activism will also be considered. Feel free to query if you
are uncertain as to whether a message is appropriate. All
correspondence with the editors regarding submissions to the
list remains confidential and should be directed to us at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Also welcome are other sorts of news, e.g.,
event reports, obituaries, and reading lists (annotated or not).

Queries may be posted to the list when deemed appropriate;
we request that the posting subscriber assemble "highlights"
from respondents' posts to be published to the list.

Solicited submissions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) may
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The editors reserve the
right to contact any subscriber regarding possible submissions.

Posts to the Poetics List should abide by the rules of "Fair Use"
when quoting material for which the posting subscriber does not
hold copyright. Please do not post to the list personal or
"backchannel" correspondence, or other unpublished material,
without the express permission of the author!

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a
whole, or supply information missing from an post, or thank
someone for posting something you requested, please send the
request or comment directly to that individual, and not to the
list editors.

Send messages to the list directly to the list address:

     <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

When sending to the list, please send only "plain text". Note,
however, there is no problem with sending clickable URLs in
HTML format.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents in a post, since this may make it difficult for
those who get the list via "digest" or who cannot decode
attached or specially formatted files. The use of "styled"
text or HTML formatting in the body of email posts to the
list appears not to be compatible with the the list's
automatic digest program; as a result such messages disrupt
the format of the Digest, even though this coding is
readable for some subscribers who do not use the digest
option.

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

As an outside maximum, we will accept for publication to
Poetics no more than 5 messages a day from any one subscriber;
in general, we expect subscribers to keep their post to less
than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers) of twenty or
fewer messages per day.

For further information or to contact the editors, please
write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

4. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Please do not publish list correspondence without the express
permission of the author! Copyright for all material posted on
Poetics remains with the author; material from this list and its
archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Please
do not bother submitting such messages to the editor. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat
offenders will be removed from the list immediately. Please do
not put this policy to test!

-------------------

5. Digest Option

The Listserve program gives you the option to receive all the
posted Poetics message each day as a single message. If you
would prefer to receive ONE message each day, which would
include all messages posted to the list for that day, you can
use the digest option.

Send this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics digest

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this
message:

     set poetics mail

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

     set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 8 below.)

-------------------

7. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

-------------------

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

Our mission is to serve as a hypertextual gateway to the
extraordinary range of activity in formally innovative writing in
the United States and around the world. The Center provides access
to the burgeoning electronic resources in new poetries including
RIF/T and many other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS List
archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts and
bibliographies, and direct connections to numerous related
electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about
contemporary print little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in
poetry and poetics. And we have an extensive collection of
soundfiles of poets reading their work, as well as the archive of
LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

-------------------

9. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://epc.buffalo.edu>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to
<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html>.

You may browse the Poetics List archives by month and year or
search them for specific information. Your interface will allow
you to print or download any of these files.

-------------------

10. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: The Electronic Poetry Center listings of
poetry and poetics information is open and available to you. We
are trying to make access to printed publications as easy as
possible for our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate!

Send a list of your press/publications to
<glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu>, with the words EPC Press Listing in
the subject line.

You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word
processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail
message to the address above to obtain a mailing address to
which to send your disk. Though files marked up with html are
our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your word
processor will save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is
also highly desirable.

Send us extended information on new publications (including any
back cover copy and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs or
backlists (including excerpts from reviews, sample poems, etc.).
Be sure to include full information for ordering--including prices
and addresses and phone numbers both of the press and any
distributors.

You might also want to send short announcements of new publications
directly to the Poetics List as subscribers do not always (or ever)
check the EPC; in your message please include full  information for
ordering. If you have a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention
that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have
received a noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to
promote your publication and we are glad to facilitate information
about interesting publications.

The Widowing Sound of Leaves


Don't question her numbers


because biology treats code as essential, without code
not yet understanding awareness.  A pulp science

and x surrounds x in parentheses.  The plus and minus

of the arrangement of closet hangers, as they
corral the clothing into clumps and entangled
assemblages, is edible. And hunger keeps us warm.


Count


this thread, a maze of developments, cotton
in its own accepting computation, engaged in the unfolding
line of protein or silicon and protein. A prosthesis

following one plus x cubed. The equal sign

of the one slipping billboard panel, peeling
down to reveal the colors of  past advertisements,
cannot be consumed. And immediately poisons the panel.


Don't calculate her total


when the human essence is a function of possession,
and the function preexists the heart's ownership,
locating cognition in disparate parts. A Neuromancer

generating a series: zero, zero, one, zero. The brackets

contain the names written in a fogged shower door,
or scratched in soap on the bathtub's vinyl curve, just
before the water overrules. And rules never taste the same.


Ask


for models of subjectivity or prevent the multiple
ironies from being taken seriously. A prediction

renamed as zero to the third power plus one. The division

maintains the widowing sound of leaves when
a bike's wheels cross from cement to grass paths,
steering more from resistance than direction.  And friction devours.


Don't answer her questions


about the desire of intelligence to reach steady states, about
the rapid entanglement of material displaced by thought or emotion
and thought, about a fixed center.  An inscription

where n equals seven, when one follows n.     The burst

of errors     caused by science experimenting with ink,
and the way pens leak away through evaporation, colors
moving from a metal ball to paper or air. And paper digests itself.


React


is a code, lines generating additional reactions, encoded or decoded
with coefficients and polynomials, used in the interface between
bodies and the textual world, or only used.  An image pneumonia

for a sequence: one over zero, one over zero,
seven over one over zero, one.  The pattern

exists in bathroom tile, industrial for its own safety,
attractive when covered with unclear liquids, attractive because our eyes
need sharp angles to focus, and patterns to remind us of breathing.  But
designs will consume the handsome.


Don't regard her problems


as a flight simulator utilizing feed-back loops, interconnecting
the relevant boundaries of simulation and circuitry, the random
borders of surrogacy and affection.  A coupling system

and a digit string  in x and the burst of x plus n.  The transmission

needs rain in warm weather, migrating puddles of grass
and asphalt and sand, moving not at the rate of wind, but the rate
of swing sets instead.  And water is erosion is water.


Estimate


pulling a rabbit from a larger system,  the potentially infinite
regress of empathy and how close the body sidesteps desire,
how close are magic and the observer.  A recollection

raised by a factor of three degree vectors.     The primitive

screen, wire mesh framed by metals slats,  holding vision
in the small spaces between angles, separating the image of backyards
into disconnected sections: the root of all
worlds.  And the source of all code.


Don't solve her equations


with  hyphenated creatures, essentially human, colonized by numbers
and the division of domination and ambiguity.  A pulp science

and x contain zero, one, zero in no certain order. The plus and minus

of  watching a bouncing plastic ball move from the hand
to sidewalk, its rebounds swayed by cracks, watching
its spinning colors stop at the equal sign.  And be swallowed.


Invent


a reflexivity, a spin on the encoded assumption,
an intuitive leap from protein to cognition to digital
systems, blundered by organic order.  A privileged


value dependent on the sum of one and x in parentheses
squared. The birth

of missing objects begins in the tangles of branches,
or in the jumbled cord where a paperclip holds dust close to the cables,
where leaving in two directions
leaves intentions behind.  And purpose close to paper.


Don't make her into her.


She is the snow crash.  Hers is a devolving inscription.

The prosthesis of equations.  A guarantee

for the flickering lights.

Jason Nelson

interested collectors, Boggs looks for merchants who will accept his drawings
in lieu of cash payment for their wares or services as part of elaborately
choreagraphed transactions, complete with receipts and change-- an artistic
practice that regularly lands him in trouble with treasury police around the
globe.

perceived. Whatever distress or destitution might come of it."

15. _Pamela: A Novel_, Pamela Lu, Atelos, $12.95. "His self-similarity
suggested the presence of a phenomenology absorbed in mysterious, microscopic
processes of macroscopic scale, so that we were inclined to react to him as

waiting to happen."

The First Annual Transcontinental Poetry Contest
by Pavement Saw Press

Each year Pavement Saw Press will seek to publish at least one book of
poetry and/or prose poems from manuscripts received during this
competition.
Selection is made anonymously through a competition that is open to
anyone who has not previously published a volume of poetry or prose. The
author
receives $1000 and a percentage of the press run. The judge of the
competition is Bin Ramke.

All poems must be original, all prose must be original, fiction or
translations are not acceptable. Writers who have had volumes of
40 pages or under printed or printed in limited editions of no more than
500
copies are eligible.

Submissions are accepted from June 1 until August 15 .

Entries must meet these requirements:

1. The manuscript should be at least 48 pages and no more than 64 pages
in length.

2. A cover letter which includes a brief biography, the book's title,
your name, address, and telephone number, your signature, and, if you
have e-mail, your e-mail address. It should also include a list of
acknowledgments for the book.

3. The manuscript should be bound with a single clip and begin with a
title page including the book's title, your name, address, and telephone

number, and, if you have e-mail, your e-mail address. Submissions to the

contest are judged anonymously.

4. The second page should have only the title of the manuscript. There
are to be no acknowledgments or mention of the author's name from this
page forward.

5. A table of contents should follow the second title page.

6. The manuscript should be paginated, beginning with the first page of
poetry.

7. There should be no more than one poem on each page. The manuscript
can
contain pieces that are longer than one page.

Your manuscript should be accompanied by a check in the amount of $15.00

made payable to Pavement Saw Press. All US contributors to the contest
will receive at least one book provided a self addressed 9 by 12
envelope with $3.20 postage is provided. Add appropriate postage for
other
countries. For acknowledgment of the manuscripts arrival, please
include a stamped, self-addressed postcard. For notification of results,

enclose a SASE business size envelope. A decision will be reached in
September. Book(s) will be published before January 31st, 2000. Do not
send
the only copy of your work. All manuscripts will be recycled, and

I would like to apologise to this list for the _Perihelion_ posts.

I am writing this short e-mail to let you know that 1) Perihelion is not

open to unsolicited submissions and 2) I am no longer soliciting poetry
submissions on its behalf.

I am sending separate messages to those of you who had generously
responded to my call with work.  Poems may remain under consideration by
the editor-in-chief, Rebecca Seiferle, or may be rejected separately.

Well, it was a learning experience.

TONGUE


"Make clear my tongue, my Salvation,
And open Thou my mouth."

(Unknown Serbian poet, 13th century, from Predrag R. Dragic Kijuk, Med-
iaeval and Renassance Serbian Poetry.)

The Lord Jesus is healing and helping people. Would you let me heal you.
Would you let me pray for you. This one just came up, suffering from
extreme depression and anxiety, couldn't even leave the house, I want to
administer to every person, the demon wouldn't let her leave the house.
We're going to pray some more. This job is extra increase. I'm hearing 5
or 8 hundred extra dollars per month. Thank you Lord. Thank you Jesus.
Get in agreement with this word of knowledge. When I pray in a moment I'm
going to administer in this area of a job. Any incurable disease? Don't
just sit there. I'm going to pray in the area of incurable disease. Don't
just sit there. Quit sitting there. Let me minister to you. Do something.
Oh yes. There's that job again. There's another person that needs a better
job. There's one on the streets right now looking for a better job. Just
received news that the current cancer tests are negative. Halleluja. We're
conquering in the name of Jesus. There's a Deuteronomy 9 that says we're
going to cross into all that we have for us. I'm going to conquer it for
you so that when you enter in you can subdue it and enter quickly. We're
taking from the hands of the Devil what belongs to us. He was persistent.
I want it. It's mine. Wake up that new home. Wake up that new job. I'm
speaking the home. I'm speaking the word home. I'm speaking the job. I'm
speaking the word job. I'm speaking the word. I'm speaking the Word. I'm
speaking the Word Word. I'm speaking the Word Word Word. I'm speaking the

NOT A HORSE. NIKUKO RIDES EXISTENCE, STARVES IT TO DEATH. EXISTENCE DIES
AND WORDS TURN TO THE SOUND OF THE WIND AND THE WIND DIES TOO.

Apologies to all for cross-posting!

A Brief Notice of Two Excellent Publications

Fire #8 is now available from Jeremy Hilton at Field Cottage/ Old White
Hill/ Tackley/ Kidlington/ Oxfordshire OX5 3AB/England.

A bargain at 4 pounds (or U.S. $8.00), 7 pounds for a three issue
subscription, and weighing it at a generous 160 pages, Fire presents large
selections from the work of contemporary British, American, Australian, =
and
New Zealand poets. This issue includes outstanding performances from Paula
Green, Bill Griffiths, Cid Corman, E. Webb, Coral Hull, and 47 other =
writers
with such intriguing names as Dee Rimbaud and Zenobia Venner. The =
wonderful
thing about Fire is that the possibility of discovering fine work lurks
behind every page. Hilton provides space enough for each writer so that =
one
can truly get a feel for his or her voice.



Though the latest issue of Terrible Work (#8) has been out for almost a
year, it still deserves a mention because of its superior content and the
range and depth of its reviews. Terrible Work gives a great over-view of =
the
current Brit. Poetry "alternative" scene. It also presents fine helpings
from Jasmine Maddock, W.D. Herbert, Allen Fisher, Geraldine Monk, Jeremy
Hilton, Tina Darragh, Andrew Duncan, Michael Basinski, Spencer Selby, and
other knowns, unknowns, and soon-to-be-knowns, or perhaps
never-to-be-knowns. Add to that 30 single-spaced pages of intelligent
reviews, and a page or two of pointed commentary from editor Tim Allen
(including a "critical cover")=96and you have yourself a great object of
contemplation. Available from the editor at 21 Overton Gardens/ Mannamead/
Plymouth/ PL3 5BX/ England at 3 pounds 50 per issue, or 9 pounds for three
issue a subscription, or U.S. equivalents.

From your correspondent (who appears in both of the above) in the land of
the Rising (risen by now) Sun. Jesse Glass

For anyone who might be interested, I have written a Word 97 for Windows
macro that automates one of Jackson Mac Low's diastic text-selection
procedures. After several fruitless searches for the original DIASTEXT, and
the realization that I could get paid for spending a day at work quietly
writing poetry software...well, you can see where that's going. The
template in which the macro is contained also has another macro for
building concordances. Feed it a Word or text file and it will spit out a
word count, count of the number of words minus repetitions (i.e., the
lexicon of the document), and count of the number of instances of each
word. This one runs a bit more slowly than the diasticator: a 2,000 word
text took it close to three minutes. That's still orders of magnitude
faster than I could have done it with paper and pencil, but I'd recommend
planning a coffee break if you feed it anything longer than a page or two.

My apologies to Mac users on the list (myself included: I only have the PC
at work) for not translating and testing the macro on that platform. That's
complicated by my having only an older version of Word on my Mac, which
would have necessitated translating from VBA to Word Basic. Maybe one day
I'll get around to coding the whole thing for Mac, and for older versions
of Word (or as a stand-alone C++ app, thus getting around the proprietary
software problem) -- but don't hold your breath. I'm less inclined to spend
a day at home doing this on my own time. (Which is some kind of perverse
work ethic, to be sure). About the only update I'm planning right now is a
line-finder for the concordance macro, so you'll get not only a count of
occurrences for each word, but a line number identifying where each one is.

Anyhow, the file is available for download from my FTP directory:
ftp://ftp.mindspring.com/users/cartograffiti/macros/FreqCount.dot. I also
recommend you read the documentation, saved as a text file in the same
directory: ftp://ftp.mindspring.com/users/cartograffiti/macros/about.txt.
And a final word of warning: as Word macros are a popular vector for
DOS-based viruses, I strongly recommend running a virus scan on the file
when you download it. The most recent updates of McAfee VirusScan and
Norton certified it virus-free when I uploaded it, but since my directory
isn't password-protected, you should consider it a (very slight) risk.

Alright, then, sorry to have taken up so much space on something sure to be
of interest to only a very small handful of people. I hope someone finds
some use or amusement in it.

Best,
Taylor

Anyone visiting or living within vicinity of Los Angeles, the LA County
Museum's Eleanor Antin retrospective is a knockout resurrection of her
conceptual, video, performance and installation works. A great imaginative,
zany mind at work having fun exploring real stuff. If you ever wondered, for
example (as I have) if Cindy Sherman's work had a mother, she's here in
spades. A big kudoo to Howard Fox, the curator, who pulled it together. By
the way, give yourself plenty of time for a choice of many videos, several of
which are a riot. If you can't get to the show, the catalog is good, full of
evidence, etc. And, by the way, it's still easy to go shopping practically
across the street at Sun and Moon's treasure full bookstore.
Cheers,
Stephen Vincent

JARNOT, BROWN & MAYER @ NAROPA

This week marked the beginning of the Naropa Writing & Poetics Summer
Writing Program's 25th anniversary. O star-studded. O gala. O unseasonable
rain & damp. O all the stops pulled out.

I won't be covering each & every reading as I've done the past two summers.
Instead, I thought I'd offer reports of selected evenings. This way I can
play more golf, which is almost as important as poetry.

Lisa Jarnot began the evening by remarking, "This is an interesting
situation. I've never given a reading with Bernadette sitting behind me."
And indeed, Bernadette Mayer was sitting downstage of her, in partial shadow
and for reasons we may never know.  Lisa read from  new material, some of
which will appear in the forthcoming Ring of Fire this fall.  I've written
about Lisa's readings at Naropa before, so won't try (too much) to re-cover
that ground. What struck me in this new work of hers, though, was the use of
that much-neglected trope, the apostrophe. Whatever happened to the
apostrophe? It was back last night, and better than ever. "O life force of
supernalness!" began one such apostrophic poem. The key to the effectiveness
of Jarnot's use of apostrophe is contained right there, I think, in that
single line. Call it a "having your cake and eating it, too" poetics, if you
must, but the antique diction and slightly bent syntax of this exclamation
enables her to invoke and undercut simultaneously.  Genuine earnestness and
ironic distance are made to co-exist on the same playing field. It's a risky
gambit -- and quite delicious. Jonathan Culler has written a very good
esssay on the uses of apostrophe. For now I'll just say that the apostrophic
seems a particular way of laying-claim-to -- a means for inscribing a bold
and yet intimate self-presencing.

Poems read by Jarnot included a hockey poem dedicated to her brother ("and
you hold your icy wrists up to the icy sky") (Go, Sabres?); the
heartbreakingly lovely "Brooklyn Anchorage" ("and in my plan to become
myself I became someone else"); "Poem Beginning With a Line by Frank Lima;"
"Ode;" a terrific poem about Jane & Anselm Hollo's lawn furniture and the
blue hair of wildebeests that is made from stars, from ice;  and the
haunting "Psalm After Philip Lamantia."

What else is there to say? Only that in her work Lisa Jarnot employs a sly
humor and a sinuous music to affirm, via the extravagance of excessive
signifying, the fundamental joy of being alive and being alive _in_
language, of being a creature of language, plunged in the ongoing dream of
language, that is a blindness and an epiphany, an endless pronouncing and
its apophatic self-erasure.

*********************

Dear Lee Ann Brown:

Weren't we friends in another life? I don't know. The Ways of the Lords of
Karma are mysterious, the bribes impossibly high.  You have cool sunglasses
-- that much, at least, I know to be true. What you did was possibly
foolhardy -- starting your reading with a singalong of Helen Adams's "I Love
My Love." (Steven Taylor on guitar). But it was fun, even though I croaked
along in a barely sustainable baritone. Your voice was strong. It was a
pleasure to hear that macabre ballad so entuned.

You read from Polyverse and I forgot to write down the lines and I forgot to
buy the book before I started writing up this report. There was a poem
called "Present Beau for Robin Blaser." It's a form invented by Harry
Matthews, whom, you announced with regret, has decided to rename it to
"Beautiful Inlaw." I agree -- that's not as good. Either way, this form uses
only the letters of a person's name. Hence:

"Rare, rare lobelia rails/robed & born."

And this form, invented by Jack Collom, who may have given it a name:

"Here we
sit but
where is
our food?"

And you sang "Shady Grove" - a sheer delight. And a distinctive Southern
lilt re-entered your voice when you came to the phrase, "Blue Ridge beer."

You read a poem for your grandmother, Agnes Wylie, 1902-1999, and for once
it wasn't an elegy to a grandparent laden with false sugars. In this poem
you used a wonderful word -- "infloresence" -- and that, it seems to me, is
an apt description of your own method: a kind of continual blooming: an
exfoliation along the finite lines of a fractal pattern: fragments of petals
containing the whole flower: and containing the whole history of the flower:
and of its species: and the corresponding history of its infoliation, along
the lines where a stress may fall/flow: and a tracing of the sutures of
dynamic invention: it's an odd sort of prayer you are making without really
praying.

And dear Lee Ann Brown, that's such a good kind of poem to be making. I bet
you could walk down the street all day and say "Yes" to every single thing
you see until you say "No," and that would be even better than "Yes."

Your very truly,
P.

******************

Of Bernadette Mayer I will try to tell if I can.

Bernadette Mayer is a character. Quite possibly the Original Character. At
the very least, she is in the Original Characters' Hall of Fame. Maybe, to
borrow a phrase from Jack Collom and Michael Friedman, she is the Sixth Man
off the bench of Original Characters. Anne Waldman, in her virtuoso
introduction, said: "writing was waiting for her to arrive," and who could
deny the truth of that I'd like to know?

The second thing Bernadette Mayer said was: "If I alarm you, don't be
horrified." I forget what the first thing was.

She began her set by reading, "Your Penis Is Homeless," a firebreathing
invective against somebody, god help him whoever he is, that was equal parts
Juvenalian insult and the best taunts of your superior 3rd-grader (it's hard
to tell the difference when they take their hats off).

One of the milder examples: "your nostrils resemble the assholes of cops."

Then came a collaboration with Brad Hill, a very tall young poet with an
enormous backpack. They collaborated to make sure that Brad could attend the
reading.

Next: "These are dreams, so I'll skip those."

And then a series of delightful epigrams:

"There is no one at the bird feeder today.
It's raining cats & dogs."
__

Yom Kippur

"I'm dead.
Thank god it's not emotional here.
Ecstasy, that's another matter."
__

"Okay, here come the real poems" (This "threat" was repeated several times,
only to be followed by more epigrams).

But then a "real" poem did come along. It was a long poem about sleep. Or
rather, about the anxiety produced by sleeplessness. About trying to woo &
coerce sleep. About "the artless lambency of a famous night's sleep."

Can't sleep? Try the capitalist method:

" I have ownership of sleep. Sleep is mine."

(This worked instantly the first time she tried it)!

After the sleep poem Bernadette Mayer read a poem during a single hour from
August 1992. Essentially, then, a meditation on the category of The Hour --
one to out-Augustine Augustine.  A poem, then, about the endless dilations
and contractions of "an hour." More fractal geometry at work here. The
island is finite -- its shoreline is not.

And a graph of the mind moving, ceaselessly moving, moving in
Bernadette-time, which is post-Einsteinian free-for-all time. Which is "I go
to the star and come back and dance on your still youthful head time." Of
the subdivisions of time there is no end, no, nor any end to thinking about
them until your hour is up.

My hour is up. Thank you, Sister Bernadette.

Patrick Pritchett

*structure of speech*
attempting to come to terms with structure and its integrity: how
wishful. the frailty of thinking this way sadly persists. little feeling
remains within the flower, as of now. as always, words lack fire.
unless misspoken, bringing anxiety and calling for a drum. there is
a time inside each word then
 a curving, broadening out into a universe. or tone poem.
or an excuse to make more excuses.

*this is not a bridge*
this bridge is a point of land that overlooks the sea. the simple
facts come in thru the wall of experience. door of experience in
the wall of perception. the time thing includes a hazy map. somewhere
 your position becomes important. it might actually be a
way to survive with light. the rhythm, now,
comes a-calling.

*road map*
the i-love-you crowd digs around the edges until an island is
formed. there's nothing like a perfection of solitude, where the
sounded sounds of kisses slurp with the hiss of the waves. your
expression of doubt, gayety or harsh anti-cynicism can create a
spell. let's not tell the magistrate.

*a hurdy gurdy*
never knowing where one is, the sounds come from all
around. a  mysterious launching exists in the works. the
stars, well, of course, they will always be close. that's the
point of music, really. the mystic sense of a hurdy gurdy is envy.
oh yes, time thrilled by the meaning of music, hah, that's why
writers type fast, or scribble illegibly. that's why the strings are
scraped in just that fashion, caterwaul and all. the
theory is simple, and really quite accurate,
so far as it goes.

*French timepiece*
think how a language can include roses, stories, terror,
maps, particulars of doubt and much more. a kiss is just a kiss, or
so you are almost ready to believe. but are words on lips? on ne
sais (as they say) jamais. France, it is known, has a time of its
own. back to medieval out of the apple seed. oranges are foreign
and strange. this falls over a cliff, never really quite accurate.

*special auction*
speech in a town called French Lover in Flowers. a dalliance sporting the
usual tremours and musical notes. force of the light slipping boundaries and
passing the enclosures. if indeed rivalry can be spoken of, longing as a
spiritual intention, and running a moment of insistence. you can run
too, you can run to. that's the speech that lives in the speech
of the town called French Lover in
Flowers. a slipper kicked high in the sky gathers the eye.
the glow is exquisite, don't tell the magistrate.

"just once in a while pin something on the wall"

Can the word "propoganda" ever exist in an open-ended question?   Is it
a even a word?  For anyone sensitive to philosophy, the love of truth,
looking for truth, questioning truth-statements, doesn't propoganda
preclude doubt, including self-doubt, insisting on a language that
speaks the truth?  The slogan on a newspaper I read and have even sold
at a few plant gates says "The _______ tells the truth."  It doesn't
always.  Sometimes there are mistakes.  Most of the correspondents work
in industry.  Sometimes they slant the coverage.  The editors try to
correct obvious errors and overstatements.  No, there were not thousands
cheering Fidel in South Africa, etc.  "A"-1: "Foreheads wrinkled with
injunctions: / 'The Pennsylvania miners are again on the lockout, / We
must send relief to the wives and children-- / What's your next
editorial about, Carat, / We need propaganda, the thing's / becoming a
mass movement."  This evolves into "A"-8's verbatim Lenin:  "Learn,
learn, learn! / Act, act, act! / Be prepared, well and completely
prepared / To make use, with all our forces, / Of the next revolutionary
wave. / That is our job."  Maybe the ugliest lines in all of "A"?
Cement truck-like.  And then of course the famous silence turning inward
with "A"-11.  "A"-8, 1935-37.  In March 1937 a Joint Commission of
Inquiry was formed that would soon go by the name of The Dewey
Commission, named after its chairman, John Dewey, "America's leading
philosopher and educationist" according to Issac Deutscher. (Well, along
with Charles Pierce).  "He put aside work on a treatise 'Logic:  the
Theory of Inquiry.'"  The Moscow Trials.  The counter-trial.  The
cross-examination of Leon Trotsky née Lev Bronstein.  I don't know all
of Zukofsky's correspondence, and wonder if he ever mentioned any
awareness of the Dewey Commission to anyone, or was his imagination of
Marxism so influenced by the university schoolroom and classmates who
started out left in the 30s and wound up right in the 50s that it earned
him a footnote in a scholarly study by Alan Wald on the subject of
political amnesia, a book which has nothing to do with poetry or
poetics.  Does propoganda have anything to do with poetry or poetics?
Maybe that new book by Benjamin posted on the Bridge St. flyer has an
answer, I don't know.  WB is torn over the question of joining the KPD
while in Moscow the winter of 26/27.  A sensitive philosopher turning to
face the fear of propaganda work, which is part of political work.
While in Moscow he submits an article on Goethe for the Soviet
encyclopedia and Radek criticizes it for how many times "class struggle"
is mentioned.  What a falling off there was.  There's a photograph from
some ten years earlier, a whistle stop, the sealed train in transit,
Lenin is talking to the town mayor welcoming them, Inessa Armand is
directly behind in conversation with Radek, and Zinoviev is bringing up
the rear holding the hand of a small child.  Has this photograph been
doctored by my memory (I'm not looking at it, the book it's in.)  Am I
substituting Radek for Bukharin?  Where is Krupskaya?  Perhaps
propaganda is the Howl to philosophy's Owl, the old interpret the world
or change the world, maybe it's even lurking somewhere in the shadows of
Whitman's conjoining of "art and argument"--but that's a thought for
another poster.  Like the question of the relation between teacher and
student and the making of poetry.  Like the question Why publish? and
Pessoa's solution, which scares me.  There's a word in Russian for
writing for the desk drawer--I heard someone from Russia talk about it
in Hoboken.  I don't remember what the word was. What kind of world
could produce such a word.  I heard Betsy Stone say in Pittsburgh about
a year ago, a woman who looks a lot like and whose voice even sounds a
little like Susan Howe, "Just for the fun of it I started counting.
Seventeen languages spoken on my shift."  There are people like her
doing work in the trade unions, and she wouldn't flinch at the phrase
"propoganda work" or "propoganda party."  To militants like her I think
it means simply getting out your ideas, getting into discussions, not
imposing your ideas, not dominating --especially anyone who's starting
to think aloud for the first time.  The kind of thing that happens at an
open mic.

Subject:  East Timor: High level of human rights abuses threaten ballot
Date: Mon, 21 Jun 1999 16:02:57 +0100


* News Release Issued by the International Secretariat of Amnesty
International *
East Timor: High level of human rights abuses threaten ballot

21 June 1999

With just seven weeks to go before the UN conducts a ballot on East Timor's
future, an atmosphere of fear and insecurity persists in the disputed
territory, Amnesty International delegates returning from a research visit
said today at the launch of a major report.

  "Serious human rights abuses are continuing and are undermining the East
Timorese people's ability to exercise their rights, despite promises made by
Indonesia to provide security for the East Timorese people," Amnesty
International said. "If people do not feel safe, they will not be able to
participate freely in the ballot."

  "Responsibility for these abuses lies squarely with the newly-formed
civilian militias in East Timor, and with those who have assisted and
protected them, namely the Indonesian military forces, and to a lesser
extent the Indonesian police."

  The UN consultation process is the result of a tripartite agreement
between Indonesia, Portugal and the UN signed on 5 May 1999. On 8 August
1999 the East Timorese will be able decide whether to accept or reject a
proposal for autonomy with Indonesia.

  Amnesty International's report -- based on a May 1999 visit to Indonesia
and East Timor -- documents a well-organised campaign to threaten and
intimidate the population into supporting autonomy and to disrupt
pro-independence groups participation in the ballot process.

  Pro-independence activists, students and civil servants are the main
targets of this campaign with hundreds being arbitrarily arrested,
{tortured} and ill-treated, "{disappeared}" or killed by civilian militias,
operating with the support and at times direct involvement of the Indonesian
security forces.

  The current level of violence, ongoing human rights violations and forced
relocation of some communities is impacting on all East Timorese, and has
led to thousands of people fleeing their homes.

  {Human rights defenders} and humanitarian workers have been threatened and
some have gone into hiding.  Both domestic and international {journalists}
have also been threatened and beaten in an attempt to prevent them from
reporting on militia attacks.

  The Indonesian security forces are supporting and at times directly
involved in militia attacks and pro-integrationist campaigns, despite
Indonesian commitments under the Agreements to provide security to all East
Timorese people and guarantee the neutrality of the security forces.

  Little, if any, action is being taken to prevent militia attacks, and hold
those responsible to account for recent violations. Instead, the Indonesian
authorities have recently recruited members of one of the most notorious
militias into a civilian defence unit.

  "If the Agreements are to have any chance of success, Indonesia must abide
by its commitment to protect all East Timorese, to ensure the neutrality of
the security forces and start arresting and bringing to justice those
responsible for violations," said Amnesty International.

  The international community must call on the Indonesian authorities to
fulfil the promises they made under the agreement and let the East Timorese
people determine their future freely and without intimidation.

  In view of widespread human rights violations by the militias and the
links between militia and Indonesian army activities, Amnesty International
is urging all governments to conduct an immediate review of all their
military and defence links with Indonesia to ensure that such links are not
contributing to human rights violations.

  The East Timorese National Liberation Army, Falintil, has also been
responsible for recent human rights abuses. "The independence leadership
must take steps to ensure that Falintil acts in accordance with minimum
international humanitarian standards. Their commitment to human rights
protection within this process is vital."

  "The UN ballot offers the chance to end 23 years of violence in East
Timor," Amnesty International said.  "If the popular consultation is not
perceived to be fair by all parties involved, and the high level of human
rights violations persists, the credibility of the whole process is
undermined."

this sort of thing happens all
the time. it establishes
a texture within the drama, that is to
say: one cares. people
invent chords, or
invest them, then something
exciting occurs, quite a meaningful
act, if you can revel in
responding. the tribe lingers in the
languour of the
nearby forest. a town waits to
sprout up, you see. it will be there
that folks will gather, to hear
which song will
ruin their lives.
a home run can't be explained, but it illustrates
something, as if
any illustration could
prepare us for
what follows. there's
trouble yonder. just something
desperately pronounced: which faction
won the right to fret the verbs.
our nation of nouns
has been scheming for ages, let's hear
real news. people can get
ready for anything. they back their stiff assertions with
perfect sales pitches and drama
drama drama.
DON'T BE USELESS. call home. mother
will appreciate the change in your
demeanour, as if you
finally understood that
scale of torture
again. we have rats
living where the trouble begins. you'll need to
speak quietly but firmly since
something must be done.
if anyone listens, that is.
if they do, let them
have it.

Part 2, Area C
the melting point grows more
familiar as time
shreds the concepts.
an emissary from
one of those places wants to
restore the usual thing to the
favourite processual
hitching post. a chummy
bipartisan cost-affection
will strike the fiercest nodes
with downy softness and
tired prison movies.
success will be hinted at with
only the biggest gongs.
that spattering you hear
will be an assumption
bursting inside the cave.
don't go in alone.

Part 3, Section 3, Salient 2
structure is a part-time celebration of
where the hell are my socks?
forget dogma and catalogue, we've got
program to uphold. down to
earth with ya.

Part 4, Section 4, Route 1, Fortune 500, Red Sox 3
that genetic thing went
out with every
other candle. not a blessed thing
holds us together. if you start
moaning now you'll have to
speak to Robert Johnson personally. and it
won't be easy.
nobody wants to keep
unwanted class action suits
on the docket unless
there can be unitary pleas vis-à-vis
that's my towel, this is
your shoelace, and
all tonsils are
roughly the same.
chuck these
petites choux in the
drier with the rest of the lot because
it's time to speak
English, good old
English such as was
given me by
whoever it was. English, the
tongue of tongues and
a mole to get at Tyre. everyone
please: be as nice
as guesswork will allow you. this
skate rink belongs to one
and all.

In _Ainu Dreams,_ poet George Quasha and buun (Chie Hasegawa), a
Japanese artist living in America, collaborate in poetically manifesting
the artist’s richly articulated dream-life. These eighty-odd poems
embody an ever-opening cosmos of curious image, surprising narrative,
and enigmatic "teaching" in a language no one could have dreamed up
alone. Structurally intriguing in their own right, the poems unfold the
inner secrets of the dreams themselves, yet do so in a language that is
always direct, readable, and often "addressed" to a second person (the
poet? the reader?) in a manner so startling that even reading itself
seems to be dreaming!

The book includes "Oneiropoeia: Telling Tales on Dreaming," the poet's
prose reflection on the poetics of dreaming and collaboration.

_Ainu Dreams_ is the momentous merge you get when someone rich in dreams
meets an oneiropoet at the edge of dawn—a sudden lovely flooding of the
perceptive field. The poems are radiant. It’s so rare to get words
arriving still attached to their generative image. Requires a
listener/catcher so carefully attuned as to be also one foot in the same
space. Quasha’s description of his soft perch at the edge of the dream
(entrained to the dreamer’s dream) is as amazing as these dream-pieces
that emerge from the mouth of buun. A sort of miracle infusion of
vitality in the field of dream-speak, blessedly free of interpretation.
And the drawings! and the front and end pieces—the book comes at it from
so many fluid angles it lifts & floats you in its burbling current.—Nor
Hall

The oneiropoeia of _Ainu Dreams_, involving a remarkable process of
collaboration, transcription, and transformation, has generated these
affectionate, quirky, and questioning pages. Fables retrieved from the
borders of consciousness, dialogues with the finite and what lies
beyond. What a wild idea, what fun (see e.g. "Meaningless
Chili")!—Anselm Hollo

There is a world of difference between the dream that is dreamed and the
dream that is told. And maybe that difference is precisely the world we
live in, the compromised latitudes between private dream and public
telling. _Ainu Dreams_ is an exciting book because it asks Who is
dreaming? Who listens when who is telling? Negotiating issues of
identity and absence, Quasha and Hasegawa weave and unweave subtle
patterns of narrative—a story is not just what can be told, but also
what can be distorted, transformed, forgotten. They teach us to read
with our eyes closed, and hear images as if we were, as we are,
dreaming. _Ainu Dreams_ is also a timely book, because it marks the
first publication in many years by the important American poet whose
long poem, _Somapoetics_, was a vital ingredient in the shaping of
recent poetics.—Robert Kelly

Despite the typo, that's li'l old me, and (shameless self-promotion)
xconnect was nice enough to make me the "featured writer" in the issue,
which means extra poems and my picture on the contents page.  Have a
looksee!   -m(ichael magee).

Virtual Languor


..."I had forgotten, almost, how thrilling fountains can be. An amazing
spectacle. Earlier today, my family went to the Rio to see a traveling art
exhibit called the treasures of Russia. In the exhibition, there were some
watercolors of the fountains at the Palaces at Peterhof, and they took my
breath away. Alright, alright, perhaps that was a bit cliche, but they
were captivating. It made me think of my visit to Versailles, the exhibi-
tion, that is. Speaking of France, my window also looks out upon the as-
of-yet uncompleted Paris Hotel. I am staring at a half-finished Eiffel To-
wer and a pint-sized Arc de Triumphe and it is very amusing. I would that
that everyone would love Vegas just for its sense of humor. And right now
I am looking at the boulevard before the hotel which is lined with lighted
trees whose rustling leaves make the white lights twinkle and a skyline
that is all purple and teal, and I am completely charmed and I just wanted
to share that with you. I could have written you about how I started to
doubt my own reality Tuesday night, but writing about warm winter nights
is so much nicer now. I love you,

Jennifer"

QUESTION?
I want to get a loan to put me through a great school. I live in Santa Monica
and I hate driving, but I might hate idiot teachers more. I suppose I could
move but my rent is cheap. I want to write. And study.. Any suggestions?
These days no nunneries.
Recommendations? I have no credentials. I went to Cal-Arts, but mom wouldn't
pay. I went to Loyola but mom wouldn't pay. I went to Santa Monica City
College, so mom didn't have to pay. I was accepted into UCLA but the thought
of large classes, i.e.. parking was too much. I facilitate a poetry workshop
at Beyond Baroque, but it doesn't pay for me to sit around and study and
write.
Mom says I should become a stock broker/consultant to old ladies whose
husbands have died. Actually cousin Mickey made the suggestion to her. (She
lives in Wisconsin, and wears a Mickey Mouse applique on her over coat.)
Because mom reminds me women live longer then men.
I can see the advertising already. Are you an old stupid hag who can't handle
your money because you are a women and your husband is dead?
Help!! Serious replies appreciated!!

And, as Faye Kosmidis of Bernhard DeBoer Distributors just told me this
morning, and asked me to pass on to you: Please ask your local bookstores to
stock literary magazines. She related her experience at the recent CCLM
colloquiam on small press distribution, where the Barnes and Noble marketing
person bragged about the fact that B&N stocks the "top fifty literary
magazines" - so guess which of the fifty are really literary (the others
being, e.g., Writer's Digest)? The answer is, there were two actual literary
magazines of the fifty, Granta and Glimmer Train. Btw, Borders DOES make an
effort to stock real literary mags.

Well, that's it for now.  Please do take a look at the new PNY; it is really
fine, maybe all around the best we've done.

Dear J:

The work's the thing, eh? Study? Read! If you need a degree to become a
teacher--do go to UCLA. College is War and so fight battles there.
My degree has me teaching--which I love--and though the poetry's
the thing--it can't be the bills, too.

Ask anyone--the bills are paid by either teaching or some form of it--or
something completely dif. Stockbroker is an idea--one--but so is
busdriver! So is teaching. Everyone I know teaches--students give so
much back--I've taught at the college level and now at the 7th grade
level. I perfer the young ones--I would not teach "workshops"
tho--What's the point?

My New York City is so lovely this time of year, there is real magic in
the neon signs high above Times Square. What would it be like to live up
there, so near the clouds, beautiful neon colors flashing against your
linen curtains (which will do little to keep out the sound of the traffic
below). I can only imagine. I wander and see so many large things moving
and I wonder what Benjamin Franklin would say if he were wandering with
me, all these moving lights like orderly fireflies and no one God the
Creator telling them what to do, they way they flash on and off around the
bushes back home. It is truly a magical wonderland and I cannot imagine
anyone unhappy who could live there in the middle of the lights.

Now I will ascend to the lights. Some say other people need other people,
but I say, no, the lights are surely sufficient. I rise floor after floor
looking in at so many lives, and now I will be in the midst of the lights
of Times Square, New York City, USA, and the tubes and transformers are
themselves things of beauty, the black metal machinery holding everything
together, making the galaxy pulse and glow.

Here I will contemplate the white horse which is not a horse and existence
which has been stolen, or perhaps never was. For I shall hold existence in
my shiny tiny palm, and existence will reflect the whole wide world in its
many colors. Shall I hold you, existence? Shall I, shall I?

It is a well known fact that if you take the head off a young girl, she is
no longer a young girl who can appreciate beautiful things. You have made
a thing diminished by subtraction, just so if you take the head off a colt
of any color, it no longer roams and whinnies at beautiful sunsets. It is
no longer a colt, but a shame, I would say, to see such a young thing dead
and all, and it never lived long enough to have a name.

A thing is no longer a thing by subtraction, it has lost the rectitude of
the name, I will say, but oh, look at the shimmering signs there, text
scrolling up and down the buildings, I do see that I shall have to learn
to read.

Just so, I would say, a thing is no longer a thing by addition, it has
lost the rectitude of the name, which depends on just proportion, it has
often been said, could I find the source. And just so, a horse is a horse
is a horse, no one would dispute that, but a horse plus white or a white-
ness is no longer a horse, but a supplement, either a white-horse or be-
neath the category of a supplement. For it has betrayed the rectitude of
the name, it is no longer of just proportion, and the empire is rendered
ill-at-ease.

That is why the Ming shih lun, which may be a latter addition, of Kung-Sun
Lung states "A thing is a thing and nothing more. This is actuality." And
it further states "Actuality exhibits actuality. This actuality is not
empty. It has position." And I do say, just as the fireflies do not know
their position but fire up in such orderly fashion and beauty and wonder!
so do things not know their position, of which language is a fallen Ob-
ject. Thus I agree that "Taking it from its position makes it lose its
position. Placing it in its position makes it rectified." (Oh, and now
Kung-Sun Lung is Gongsun Long, according to the rectification of names!)

The position of a horse is a horse! The position of a white horse is not
rectified, or to be sure, is not rectified as a horse, and it is not a
horse. For it is said by Confucius "Once the meanings of names are recti-
fied, they will serve as a standard of conduct." And Kung-Sun Lung says,
in this perhaps later addition, "To rectify that which rectifies an act-
uality, means the rectification of this actuality and also the rectific-
ation of its name." Oh, and Confucius said it's necessary to rectify
names! (Oh, and Who is Kung-Sun Lung?! and Who is Gongsun Long?!)

Therefore, a white horse is not a horse, for not only is whiteness a supp-
lement, but once a white horse is a horse, a dead horse is a horse, a lead
horse is a horse, a wed horse is a horse, a fed horse is a horse, and a
charley horse is a horse. Oh, such language is a disaster! One tiny fire-
fly alone can start a new and lovely pattern, however, so that everything
with additions and subtractions becomes a horse, and there is no end to
it! (Oh, whatever happened to existence!)

And I, Jennifer, say, Oh, it is really lovely that there is no end to it,
that rectitude bends according to the Fashion of the Moment, that Things
Fall Apart, only to reassemble in new and lustrous Ways! And it is a
terrible shame that we do not live forever to see how Now comes out Then
in the future, and how future Then comes out, all disheveled, without
rectitude, and and and

And it is so pretty up here and everyone can see up my long legs!

- Jennifer

a lot of schools have extensive financial aid.  are u applying to a grad or
u-grad program?  if grad, if doctoral, most "great" schools will underwrite
your sojourn to a large extent, as  they are making an investment in the
future glory you will bring to their name.  what exactly are u asking
advice for --names of schools? how to finance your way?  this mom thing is
annoying; i know plenty of families here in MN who would pay many K for a
daughter's wedding but 0 for her education.  this is 1999, fer xsake!  and
you can tell her i said so.

matter;, for not investigating and prosecuting arson fires that are
displacing hundreds of low income persons from residential hotels in San

Webster's New Universal [doesn't that sound encouraging?] Unabridged
Dictionary Deluxe [again with the encouragment] Edition offers this
suggestion (p 693), to wit, FITCHER: "to so operate a drill [in mining] that
it shall stick in the bore hole or become jammed, as in a wedge". Olson's
watered rock, Pound's rock drill: I think you can guess where I'm going
here. and don't forget DH Lawrence's father was a coal miner, as was Loretta
Lynn's. WC
Williams worked his way thru med school as a miner in the coal fields of
Pennsylvania. in fact he met HD in the mines. she regarded them as oracular
grottoes and would sneak in, pour olive oil on her head and commune with her
gods. ancient Etruscans developed a world-dominating culture because of the
rich salt
mines of Western Etrusca. Etruscans prayed to the deity Etrusca that each
day the mines would produce more valuable salt. when archaeologists
discovered transciptions of these prayers they decided, after consulting
anthropologists, linguists and other experts, that these transcribed prayers
could be regarded as poems. btw, I worked in a convent kitchen when I was in
high school and the nuns, it was a Canadian order, all spoke French! they
played "Holly Jolly Christmas" (as sung by Burl Ives) almost
constantly during the appropriate season, used to make their own hooch out
of vodka and raisins and in general seemed to keep themselves pretty neatly
amused. I hope this reply is serious enough, and that you appreciate it. AHB

Spotted a refrigerator box today (with fridge inside, otherwise i
would've carted it off)   whose printed side panel read


                            BACK


                               LAY ON BACK ONLY



this   as opposed to FRONT (i walked 'round to check the other side) &
in my mind
it argued (& agitated) not only terms & correctness of sexual position
but  questions of grammar as well.     "lie" or "lay" ?  i can never
keep it straight. "front"  "back"  or
"volte face" ?  one sighs in consternation.

Dear List,

Please excuse the fiction (& the cross-post).

I am teaching a Developing the Novel class and would be grateful for any and
all b/c suggestions for writing exercises for such a class.  Some of my
students are in the beginning stages of a novel, some are further along, but
I feel compelled to keep them all propelled, sts (so-to-speak) with
exercises for development and spark -- enough said.

Thanks

care, the nightmare.  Recent laws, hundreds of thousands off welfare in
New York City, many eligible turned away.  Medicaid computer system a
social worker said when Walrond with the baby, they were turned away.
Walrond went to three city offices for help, one six days before the
child died.  Months later, two different Medicaid cards and a HIP

those photos convict her. Three pediatricians testified in her defense.
Tabitha Walrond is why, the worst off layers of our class. We are

"support is overwhelming." Out of 8,000 workers, Alvin Wiley, a joiner
with 20 years on the job, said that at a meeting of Boilermakers Local

After 78 days bombing Yugoslavia, Washington got Moscow and Belgrade to
allow NATO in Kosova.  Officers of Belgrade's army, "The war has ended,"
at Kumanovo, Macedonia, June 9.  Moscow basically co-signed NATO's
terms. "There's no peace," said Branislav Canak, in a phone interview
the morning of June 10. "We only have the complete capitulation of the
regime and in Kosova, people, those who return, will find a devastated
area both from the NATO bombing and the looting of villages by those who
carried out the 'ethnic cleansing.' They won't be able even to consider
their right to self-determination, a protectorate."  More than 50,000
"peacekeepers" about the same as in Bosnia, the air space over and over
adjacent buffer zone.  Kosova will be five sectors, U.S., British,
French, German, and Italian forces - Russia has pledged it will not
place its forces under NATO NATO face-saving Moscow, its forces, a
symbolic presence at border crossings. March 30 New York Times, "Our
strategic interest is that Kosovo not be independent."  Rambouillet
accord for Kosovars to decide their future within three years "would
send to Basques, Kurds and other groups that we will support their
independence."  Washington open-ended occupation of Kosova as in Bosnia.
 The social cohesion of hundreds of thousands has been and is being
destroyed, entire villages erased.  "The agreement is not about
repatriation," said Martina Vukasovic, a mathematics student at Belgrade
University and an activist in the Students Union of Yugoslavia supports
self-determination for Kosova.  Last year she with dozens of other
students antiwar throughout Serbia opposition to Belgrade in Kosova.
"Tens of thousands of Serbs left Kosova opposed to the 'ethnic
cleansing' by the paramilitary gangs and special police afraid for their
lives the NATO bombing.  There's no talk about their right to return,
and the Kosova Liberation Army won't be disarmed."  The KLA, a guerrilla
group armed struggle for independence, in the camps for expelled
Kosovars in Albania KLA members cut off discussion when fellow Albanians
raised opposition to the U.S.-NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during visits
by this reporter in April and May. The KLA will now police Albanians
inside Kosova. Many in the streets on the night of June 9 cheered when
street lights came on after weeks of darkness the destruction the power
grid, relief the bombing is over.  In Nis thousands walked in the
streets late into the night on June 9, said Duci Petrovic, a leader of
the Students Union there. "Many sang songs, releasing the tremendous
stress from nearly three months of war. The only good thing is we may
soon be in a better position to resume political activities and protests
and, who knows, down the road."  Official statistics, more than 2,000
civilians killed and 5,000 wounded, unemployment 90 percent among 3
million wage workers.  Electricity in four- to six-hour shifts in much
of Belgrade now.  In Kragujevac, at Zastava, the largest car plant in
the Balkans destroyed by the NATO bombing, said Christina Ranic, a
member of the metal workers union who worked in the plant. "We get 20
deutch marks per month. That's barely enough for bread and milk. NATO
doesn't even mention what workers face. It's as if we disappeared from
the face of the earth."  On the corpses of the people of Yugoslavia, the
U.S. rulers are.  "We had a very good day," U.S. secretary of state
Madeleine Albright June 8.  Two days later 2,000 U.S. Marines were
landing at a port in northern Greece, on their way to Macedonia. There
they will join 1,700 U.S. troops coming from Albania along with Cobra
and Apache attack helicopters among the first to enter Kosova behind the
British-led force of more than 17,000 NATO troops already in Macedonia,
London the most vocal backer.  Greece prevented for a few days U.S.
ships carrying Marines from docking at Thessaloniki. Athens, Rome, and
Bonn.  Athens backed down, and Beijing?  What's behind the instability
in Russia?  Are Washington and the other imperialist powers tightening a
military encirclement of Russia?  "The hot-button issue in the 1950s
was, 'Who lost China?' " Nixon said in his memo in 1992, "If Yeltsin
goes down," Nixon said, "the question of 'who lost Russia' will be
infinitely more devastating in the 1990s."

Hi, I'm preparing a graduate level course on epistolary fiction.  If any of
you have any suggestions, please, please backchannel me.  I want to extend
the discussion to include The First Person and The Document.  I'm
especially interested in background/ historical/ theoretical readings on
these issues--not particularly to assign, but to get my knowledge up to
snuff.  Also suggested epistolary fictions would be great.  Plan so far to
include Kathy Acker, Berndette Mayer's Mothers and Letters book (any
article about that would be great), Dracula, probably stretch the envelope
with Spicer's Letters to Lorca.  Some older stuff, and probably some "real"
letters to give context to the fiction.  But, this is just a beginning.

Thanks for any help.

gratitude towards authors in the choice of the thing

or the making of it, what might be called an after thought, better again,

    Jessica, just be careful. Sometimes a school will accept you without
    financial aid, and you'll be assured by some teachers there, "don't
    worry, the aid will come later in the summer. Just move here, etc."
    and the aid won't come and they'll say "funny, this never happened
    before" etc....

Dodie,

Not really on epistolary fiction per se, but a few months ago Jocelyn
Saidenburg pointed me toward DeQuincey's essay on the English mail coach,
and I thought I should pass along the provocation. It works well to open up
some of the hidden intersections of first-person subjectivity and state
power in the letter form, and might serve as a starting point to get
students thinking critically about the more conventional lit-crit approach
to epistolary forms as hallmarks of the domestic. (Or to look at ways in
which the domestic itself is implicated in more "public" kinds of power?)

Along oddly similar lines, and since, judging from the Mayer text, you're
considering "fictive" as well as narrative-fictional approaches, might
Dickinson's letters be of interest?

Taylor

I once wanted to do such a course, but never got round to it. One of the
most interesting novels I wanted to do was Robert Kroetsch's _Gone Indian_.
In that one it is done not with letters (and the attendant question of
narrator's meddling), but with tapes, made by this graduate student from
upstate NY in northern Alberta.

SAMIZDAT #3 will be going to press later this month, and as usual I'm
wrangling things so as to set a few free copies aside for POETICS folks.

The current issue is a special number devoted to Scandinavian poetry,
and includes work by:

Anslem Hollo
Tomas Transtromer
Gunnar Harding
Marie Lundquist
Goran Sonnevi
Goran Print-Pahlson
Pia Tafdrup

and other amazing poets no one on this side of the Atlantic has read

Also:

Reviews of experimental Irish poetry

and Michael Anania's new book and CD

And:

A new column from Russia, by Masha Zavialova (some of you have seen her
writing on the subsubpoetics list).

-----
So here's the deal on the free issues:

IF you haven't received a free issue of Samizdat #1 or #2

AND you live in North America (sorry, postage on gratis issues to Europe
and Australia is a killer)

THEN just e-mail me your street address, and we'll get an issue out to
you as soon as they're printed.
-----
Better yet, SUBSCRIBE:

$10 for three annual issues, checks made out to me, and sent to:

Single copies of current or back issues $3.50 each.

I am very happy to announce that Samuel R. Delany will be joining the
Poetics Program Core Faculty starting this Fall. It will be great to have
Chip in Buffalo, teaching in both the graduate and undergraduate programs.
Meanwhile, we have just redesigned the Poetics Program pages at the EPC --
more work is to be done, but for the moment it makes information about the
Program as well as the Poetics List more easily accessible.

Dodi,

Seems that Nate Mackey's novels would be a perfect fit for your class.
Sun & Moon has the first two out, _Bedouin Hornbook_ and _Djbot
Baghostus's Run_, and they will publish the third _Atet A.D._, well,
whenever.

If you are going to take any sort of historical perspective, it would be
interesting to ask, why does the novel begin as an epistolary genre?  Part of
the answer might involve transformations in reading practices & new forms of
privitazation in the 17th century.  A good place to begin to look for answers
is A HISTORY OF PRIVATE LIFE vol 3 PASSIONS OF THE RENAISSANCE.  Also the
controversy between Henry Fielding & Samuel Richardson over the ethical
consequences of the epistolary novel is a fascinating one--and extremely
relevant to our present day constructions of the idea of "author" &
"authorship."

I just read two critical books I checked out of the library, and renewed
the maximum numnber of times.  The best books ever?  no, but they were
very useful as I was exploring relationships between love poetry and
other poetry and occasional poetry and love letters.  They gave me lots
of ideas for a mini class I'm teaching six months from now.  One's about
a courtesan who used letter writing to bolster her literary reputation
(also epistolary) in Venice, and another arguing that epistolary fiction
written by women during a time in France when very little lyric poetry
was written defined the genre.

New from Dead Metaphor Press:

_Desire Series_ by Mark DuCharme.  ISBN 1-880743-12-4.  24 pages.  $5.00.

"The domestic is a crash test in Mark DuCharme’s party-of-the-first-part
telling.  He outs ‘Genders of the obvious’ and gets into ‘Gestures capped in
answerable wool.’  The ‘desire’ in this series is warier than that of, say,
Barthes, where it is ‘taxidermy’ which is ‘lovely’ and where ‘The heart
being nothing/ Agitates slightly.’"  --Michael Gizzi

"In Mark DuCharme’s thoughtful and expansive poems, details accumulate
around the magnetic poles of dream and experience, while the center of the
field acts as a vanishing point between namables.  It is in this shifting
scale of dimension and focus that DuCharme’s work finds its cutting edge; he
is a keen observer of the mind’s changing perspectives and transformational
elements."  --Charles Borkhuis

Mark DuCharme’s books include _Contracting Scale_ from Standing Stones
Press, _Three Works (Invasive Map)_ from Oasis Press, and _Near To_
forthcoming from Poetry New York.  He lives in Boulder, CO where he is
co-director of the Left Hand Reading Series.

Greeting everyone,

I'm making the big move to Manhattan this summer and am currently going
through the motions of finding a place there. If anybody on the listserv
knows of any places opening up, I'm currently looking.

In the general vicinity of NYU is preferable. Inexpensive is also good (my
girlfriend and I will be living there on student loans). But any
information will be valuable.

Besides that, I wish to say that I'm looking forward to attending many of
the poetry readings I keep hearing about on this listserv. Perhaps I will
meet some of you at readings in the coming years.

Thanks for your time,
Bradford Senning

Haven't been in Coquitlam for fifteen years, but Friday evening, Rojeanne,
Jim and i braved rush hour traffic to catch the first poetry reading at the
new Evergreen Culture Centre. Pierre Coupey, George Stanley and Sharon
Thesen read to an appreciative crowd of fifty including Jerry Pethick,
Michael DeCourcy, Marya Hindmarch, Goh Poh Seng,  and Diane Forsythe.
Pierre, the founding editor of the Capilano Review, whose paintings and
prints graced the walls of the gallery opened the evening, reading a series
of short, crisp, imagistic? poems, dedicated to the memory of his parents:
                             VI

                   what did  we speak  when we spoke
                   figmental
                   phantoms   leopards  shooting stars

                    as if rest or dream were
                    possible      imaginary
                    hand

                     grief & echo

                      the tones of you
                      taking us to
                      some knowledge of love

                      we did not know
                      we could be moved to

                       (comet in sky

                        square inch of earth

There's a nicely produced chapbook of these poems including the prints that
accompany them and family snapshots, Requiem Notations I-IX, which was
originally produced for a show of paintings and prints he hund last year at
the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo.

George Stanley, the North American Rilke, followed starting of by reading
Creeley's poem Histoire de Florida, then a few poems from his most recent
collection, Gentle Northern Summer, ending too quickly with the brave and
brilliant

VERACRUZ

In Veracruz, city of breezes & sailors & loud birds,
an old man, I walked the Malecon by the sea,

and I thought of my father, who when a young man
had walked the Malecon in Havana, dreaming of Brazil,

and I wished he had gone to Brazil
&learned magic,

and I wished my father had come back to San Francisco
armed with Brazilian magic, & that he had married
not my mother, but her brother, whom he truly loved.

I wish my father had, like Tiresias, changed himself into a woman,

and that he had been impregnated by my uncle, & given birth to me
     as a girl.

I wish that I had grown up in San Francisco as a girl,
a tall serious girl,

& that eventually I had come to Veracruz,
& walking on the Malecon, I had met a sailor,
a Mexican sailor or a sailor from some other country--
        maybe a Brazilian sailor,
& that he had married me, & I had become pregnant
      by him,
so that I could give birth at last to my son--the boy
       I love.

After a short break, Sharon Thesen, the finest poet ever to come out of
Prince George,
acknowledging George's profundity, promised to be entertaining in contrast,
she began with the poem George had requested:

I Drive The Car

           I drive the car
while the choir ascends
toward a far transparency
these words tap at
with a show of politeness

I drive my car
and my friend also drives hers
& takes a detour to watch crows assemble
& disperse over the Cassiar Connector

They hang out there

I drive the car
afraid of the earthquake
   & drive it
afraid of myself, what is it I
do, I wonder, & also what
others do, are they also
afraid?

Or else go crazy I drive the car
around in that
too, like a maniac  like the wind

In the car someone's playing the piano
with an eye-patch on & the helium
voice of a drugged-out-poet, Besame Mucho,
& mucho federales
at the border

Where you can't step out
past a certain point painted
with certitude across the pavement &
why would you want to, anyway
enter that foreign country
all aplomb and curiosity

No, I drive the car,
I hope it works that the engine
don't fall apart. I think
oh, it will last five or ten years.
Then what. Another car.

My car I drive back & forth
around the town over bridges & here
and there, like everyone else
driving their cars.  In the back seat
sits the ghost of your grandma.

I drive the car & pick up my friend
at her house, she comes out
the red door, I'm five minutes late
& we're laughing tragically by the time we
go past the SPCA

The road is black after dark rain
and it ends in the sea.  Big semis
are minotaurs, some have smoke-stacks.
The air stings from tiny black particles
they blow at it, burdened and in a hurry

I put her in drive
& then I drive her & this
is what I do, I drive
the car.

from her sixth book, Aurora

then she read from unpublished poems, quickly terrifying herself by lapsing
into profundity.
A great evening, too short most agreed.

There was a downer review of Whalen's new Penquin collection (with intro by
Leslie Scalapino) in yesterday's San Francisco Sunday Chronicle Book Review.
I am not sure what the Chronicle critic was trying to perform other than he
somehow missed and hardly gave a clue to the rich and various brilliance(s)
of Whalen's work.
While this work has fortunately managed to get published over the years,
Whalen remains a wry counter-careerist which unfortunately has kept the poems
from larger public assessment, celebration and/or review. Maybe obscurity is
part of the character structure of some West coast giants. Kenneth Rexroth
(who was very public) had a paranoid streak that caused him to slash every
critic who crossed the horizon, leaving him dismissed from any real
consideration in the modernist Canon. Retrieval efforts to recognize his work
remain ongoing. Then there is Beverly Dahlen in hermetic, apparently quite
non-careerist retreat. Lyn Hejinian (gratefully) (among a few others) for

seems to me epistles are rich in the forms of fiction & love poetry before
the epistolary novel,  read Vincent Voiture's letters?

+ courier service in early 17th century made horse-mail a reality, 2 weeks
for a letter Paris to Rome is not bad by 20th c standards, -- provided the
courier didnt get killed by brigands. Epistles ruined by pistols.  B

ut then there were rumours (just rumours) not long ago of Italian mail
service getting so overloaded that tons of mail was burned to speed delivery
up a bit.

(& by the way, that made the Republique des Lettres possible, a widespread
exchange on intellectual matters that wd if it cd have heartily embraced
e-mail lists such as this) -- Hats off to our epistolary ancestors!

Although not strictly epistolary, the cronicas (chronicles) written by
Clarice Lispector for the Sat. edition of The Brazilian News read like
letters. She wrote these pieces over a period of six years and they are
like a private six-year conversation to the public. New Directions
published Selected Cronicas about two years ago.

Steve Vincent is being diplomatic in not saying that "the Chronicle critic"
is Tom Clark (whom I presume
must think it to have been a warm, generous and positive review of his
one-time neighbor on the
mesa). Whalen's counter-careerism certainly has been a factor, and Steve's
right about Rexroth and
Dahlen also. But I'd add Bob Grenier and even Joanne Kyger to that list. All
folks who deserve to be
read closely (and widely).

"There was a downer review of Whalen's new Penquin collection (with intro by
Leslie Scalapino) in yesterday's San Francisco Sunday Chronicle Book Review.
I am not sure what the Chronicle critic was trying to perform other than he
somehow missed and hardly gave a clue to the rich and various brilliance(s)
of Whalen's work.
While this work has fortunately managed to get published over the years,
Whalen remains a wry counter-careerist which unfortunately has kept the
poems
from larger public assessment, celebration and/or review. Maybe obscurity is
part of the character structure of some West coast giants. Kenneth Rexroth
(who was very public) had a paranoid streak that caused him to slash every
critic who crossed the horizon, leaving him dismissed from any real
consideration in the modernist Canon. Retrieval efforts to recognize his
work
remain ongoing. Then there is Beverly Dahlen in hermetic, apparently quite
non-careerist retreat. Lyn Hejinian (gratefully) (among a few others) for
example, seems to have figured it out - keeping her generous critical mind
and creative work at the public forefront - east, middle and west.
Well, I diverged from my original intent. I'm pissed off at the Chron
review.

Hi Stephen, The man that reviews poetry for the chronicle has been writing those piece of shits for a long time. They don't do anything to shed light on the poets in question work, only show that he reviewer has bland taste and only seem to know poetry from the professional and encyclopedia not emotional or religious persective. Recently, I know there was new poetry reviews by somebody different that was on the mark, and direct, and honest, a review of John Ashberry and one other one, review of another poet. But I havent seen anything by him the past weeks of the book reviews. Maybe the Whalen reviewer got mad at the editor for encorachment of territory or something.

 I definitely admit that Whalen is amazing poet, but this book is not the best. To much Buddism, kind of corny. But the introduction is terrible, hardly even readable. so maybe the whole book is cursed, anyway, but that would be sad but funny for a professional Buddist.

 Good luck finding more reviews. Vincent

I saw a TV news programme with footage of such a thing being done in the
late seventies in Italy. It involved little forklifts and bulldozers. At
the time I thought: why cant this procedure be instituted for poetry?

this isn't about me. as a teacher Robert Grenier was a sensitive, generous
listener who found excitement and communicated it. tracking American Poetry
from Whitman and Dickinson thru to Williams, Zukofky, Olson. Creeley,
Levertov, O'Hara, Ashbery, Ginsberg, Coolidge, Saroyan... encompassing the
range, tho it was with Olson that he showed the most warmth, or maybe that
was my response (this isn't about me). a picture of Grenier with Olson, a
good foot shorter than the Big Fire Source, the giant and the kid. Grenier
moved north of Boston (teaching at Tufts I think) to be within hailing
distance of Olson. reading "Skunk Island" by Robert Lowell as if it were a
Zukofsky poem, syllable by syllable. he didn't seem distracted by the
varying interests and abilities of students. he didn't slap you on the
shoulder and say, great poem. he asked questions, he reread, he asked you to
read, and read again. the discussion was in the air, he listened to the air.
3rd eye staring. sometimes you, or I, would speak a phrase, somehow, perhaps
unwittingly, happen upon an arrangement of words in writing or speech, as
one does, that struck him, and he would excitedly explain what struck him.
then he would credit you for finding. it wasn't encouragement, it was
commitment. to Poetry, which seems such a flat statement as I type. the job
at hand. recording his young daughter's Figures of Speech, found things. he
made use of a hallway lined with cork bulletin boards, usually devoted to
student artwork. carefully pinned 5x8 cards along the entire length, each
card containing one poem (later to become Sentences). he asked, what will I
do with these, his pile of 5x8 cards. a word gallery.

could go
quiet any time

he arranged for Larry Eigner to read at the school. informally gathered
around a couple of cafeteria tables, but an event nonetheless. if you want
to call that a gesture (which it wasn't, it was interest, it was genuine),
then call it a generous one. could we call Robert Grenier a pioneer? with
the idea that pioneers walk forth with or without paths. 'career' simply
describes his path. just responding to, seconding, Ron Silliman's push of
RG.

If anyone is really interested in reading this "downer" review of Philip
Whalen by Tom Clark, you can browse:



www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/06/27/RV105857.DTL.



Tom's review in Jacket, or a 1996 review in the SF Chronicle of Whalen's
Canoeing Up Cabarga Creek might seem more "generous and positive" to those
used to book reviews reading like PR blurbs rather than critical engagements
with poetry.

[think/thank = denken/danken Dankbarkeit f(--;) gratitude
Denkarbeit f(--;) brainwork]  "Du mußt dein Leben ändern."


There is a question to ask.  Or has it been asked as it has always
been asked, indirect and artificial and abstract: "Who's there?"

Is it the parrot in the opening paragraph of Toni's JAZZ that says.
(The snow she ran through so windswept she left no footprints).

Who has the right to take down a road of no return, if the time
has come to ask what poetry is for, a form "for love," or love

of form?  Is it "just between us" or is it a fist raised in the face
of the world (Mexico City, Olympics, 1968).  Power and Protest.

Or conversational intimacy, material taste of one who can withstand
my ideality of the empirical presence as condition to the possibility

of making any art at all, someone other than my propaganda?
There is an art that brings into existence in its strictest sense

its maker's signature, and it trusts its news.  Deleuze's glass bird
that eyes the Sarajevos of destroyed relations, dominating.

"Defense or attack?--he asked, as if the military operations had been
taking place just outside London.  This was written in April 1871:  THEY
SHOULD HAVE MARCHED ON VERSAILLES. (Lenin, Preface to the Russian
Translation of Marx's Letters).  The Regents of the University of
California, copyright 1977:  "[W]ithin--or between-these texts of Marx .
. . a strange theoretical novel . . . in the comedy of dialectic . . .
into the conceptual orbit of Eros . . . Marx (Engels, Lenin), the
Commune--in which is condensed a maximum of 'dreamwork,' of
'unconscious,' of 'the repressed'--to cathect the term STATE . . ."

The philosopher thinks outside the rectitude of the propagandist,
the one who hawks the News, the question
of every art's use or usefulness--how can it be made more harmful,
to whom or what can it do the most harm?

Robin at New College Chapel, Friday, June 20, 1986:  "I would love
to do that to all of you, I even thought of it.  I thought
well we'll just ask everyone in this audience to write a blasphemy.
I wonder how many of us even know what to blaspheme."

P R O P A G A N D A   B E   M Y   B E A T R I C E !

Philosophy, you who would be with me, be with me
One and the Same, speak to me a little, draw me back from Error.

Wrongly understood and wrongly posed, I am wrong as I am wronged.
There is, somewhere, a simple "there is."  I l  y  a.

There is a world that exists only in the expression on our faces,
not the words for them, even if the words are Wittgenstein's.

There is an area ab that belongs equally to a and b, a neighborhood,
vicinity, "zone de voisinage," area of a point, or point to be made,

ideology according to its neighborhood.  I l l y i c h.
This is a wall where everything holds together along hard,

sharp lines.  There is no point in asking am I right or wrong.
My propaganda is positional.  Affect infused with a proper name

solidifying the historical nature of its link to speaking tools.
In the Parmeides the One is two.  They pass into one another.
The "I" and the "Other," 'soi par soi,' inseparable, exterior.

Conceptual personae, your pseudonyms serve a secret singularity
whose "I" defers all meaning, until our meeting, made necessary,
where truth will serve the function of making us more than imaginary.

Vincent,

     I have to disagree about the introduction.  I think it did a great
job of describing a poetics of hypertext by someone 20 years ahead of
his time.

     Now I'll admit my abysmally poor cultural knowledge:  I would like
to know who wrote _Tha Art of the Fugue_ mentioned there, Leslie if you
are on the list or anyone please bc.

The next Sub Voicive Poetry event is at The Three Cups, Sandland Street,
London WC1 at 8 pm on 6th July 1999 when Elizabeth James and Patricia
Farrell read. I tell you this because

The Sub Voicive Poetry website has been taken down in view of Yahoo /
Geocities claim to have copyright in its contents. It's a pity because in
terms of the programme list and documentation it was as up to date as
possible and not far behind in other areas.
.
All that was there was information on current readings, documentation of the
last six or seven years and the texts of introductions: nothing to make a
million from. But the manner in which this change was swung is outrageous
and SVP has joined the boycott.

It will be up again in a few days, perhaps a day, once a new site has been
set up and the geocities scripts have been stripped out.

Maybe.  But at least he got a review in the Chronicle.  Think of all
the poets better than Whalen who'd never be able to get even that.

Speaking of reviews, here are a few things I wrote for a trade journal that

Edmund Berrigan, Disarming Matter
0-9669430-07, The Owl Press

"I have a desire to transcend conscious speech / not to the exclusion of
words or letters, / it is not a scholarly wish, must be removed / from the
present past future inclusive everything / beyond understanding," writes
Berrigan in "The Orbit Room" (76).  While not always so heady, the

=97 ranging in tone from the beat
goofiness of a Gregory Corso to the Symbolist-tinged collages of early
Ashbery, from the rich dailiness of a Bernadette Mayer to the more heat=
ed
"boheme" of Rimbaud  =97 is a negotiation between the dream-like irreal=
ities
of daily life, a polyvalent sexuality that is not out of tune with much=
 Gen
X flirtation with extremes, and a figure called "God" who occasionally
drops in as something like a placeholder for the channel to the "other"=

world.  The beautiful long sonnet sequence "Cross House" is a mysteriou=
s
affair, like a traipse through a virtual haunted mansion, with figures =
of
love and desire teaming among the threat of limitless possibility: "The=

persons I have seen in patterns / were so torn as to be absolute traips=
 /
[...] She had never seen him trusted above all / earthly things.  They =
were
leaning on the / screen before the fire.  'You bear your / wrongs more
gently than I can bear / mine.'  He bent over the group / in a caressin=
g
way, with renewed violence." (54)  The quiet surety of Berrigan's meter=
s
are perfect for the wavering between "violence" and the "caress," and h=
e
resembles a 17th century methaphysical =97 Herbert the closest =97 in h=
is
decorous rhetoric, which he dons most strongly when asking the "big
questions": "I have something, a major contribution / to the record of
life, in a world winter-obscene, that / works with fingers peel back a
series of inventions / for mortality.  Armchair comfortable for those w=
ho
desire it. / Absence from the physical being as strong a security as an=
y."
(34)  These are big issues for such a poet in his mid-twenties, one who=
,
consequently, never takes himself too seriously, and is as pop-sensible=
,
funny and crazily improvisatory as any grunge lyricist: "I am a heartfe=
lt
bulging crotch / when I take on the swiss initiative / [...] I made lov=
e to
Nico a lot, I dug her a lot / it was like hanging out with a guy except=
 /
she had girl pants." (16)  This combination of addresses to the higher
powers with a mischievous running-with-the-disaffecteds of the present
makes Berrigan a Hamet-like figure for the nineties -- not the highbrow=
 of
Eliot, but a thoughtful, late-century rebel engaged in his deep,
"irrational" discourse with Yorick while the world only dreams.


Barbara Guest, Rocks on a Platter
0-8195637-22, Wesleyan

Rocks on a Platter is a book-length work by a poet who has, over the pa=
st
decade or more, increasingly come to be seen as a major force in innova=
tive
poetics.  Guest is often associated with the =93New York School=94 of p=
oets
(Ashbery, O=92Hara, Schuyler) but is traditionally overlooked by chauva=
nistic
scholars preferring a homogenized version of the literary/art nexus of
activity in Manhattan in the 50=92s and 60=92s -- notably David Lehman =
in his
recent history The Last of the Avant Garde.  It appears that she may ha=
ve
the last laugh, as the yet-living poets of that group have retreated in=
to
blase irony and, occasionally, the poetic equivalent =93pot-boilers,=94=
 while
Guest has forged onward with her near-flawless ear and synaesthetic eye=
 for
word values, in the process breaking down her syle into a more spare, b=
ut
never less than rich, idiom, for which she has come to be praised.  As =
if
echoing Ashbery, the poem starts: =93Ideas.  As they find themselves.  =
In
trees?=94 but nonetheless moves on to a declaration of intent peculiar =
to
herself, finding =93Dreams set by / typography.  A companionship with
crewlessness...=94 Though the figure of Rimbaud doesn=92t appear in thi=
s work
-- Shelly, Byron, H.D., Ovid, and Eliot are among the figures inescapab=
ly
alluded to -- Guest displays a =93taste only for earth, and rock,=94 as=
 her
carved jewels of word-clusters illuminate the white space: =93Pockets j=
ingle
highly responsive place in the shelter / of those rocks    at last the
jingle of your pockets / HEARD ON THE PAGE.=94  Time, presence, the abi=
lity
of the eye to create time out of word patterns, are perhaps the central=

subjects here -- though she writes blankly =93suspicious / of fragmenta=
tion=94
this poem is highly =93fragmented,=94 though joined symphonically in th=
e
play/space of the page as =93score=94 -- a concern that exhibits itself=
 in what
can be read as commentary on the poem itself, making this an essay in
poetics as much as an epistomological cat-and-mouse.  =93Without shynes=
s or
formality /// =91a gesture of allowing oneself time=92=94 she writes (t=
he immense
white space between these spaces, where this gesture occurs, cannot be
reproduced here), and later: =93=91flotsam of the world of appearances=92=
 /
drifting by and out of the picture,=94 pointing to a Herecletian, but a=
lso
defiantly feminine (i.e. non-determinate both rhetorically and
ideolectically) poetics.  This is a very approachable book by a poet wh=
o is
bound to show you something you didn=92t know was possible in American
poetry, though the French may have been trying to tell us this for some=

time: that the whiteness of the page can be radiant.
