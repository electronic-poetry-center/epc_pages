Yes indeed Mairead -- it is the Wilkie book, & despite my absolute devotion
for MR I can't agree with Burt on this one -- it is a prose account, with
some poetically ventilated pages,-- I wld think her conscious attempt is at
creating a new, experiemntal or whatever, prose/biographical genre rather
than a long poem.

Come to think of it, my favorite of those books of hers is and remains THE
TRACES OF THOMAS HARIOT -- an absolutely brilliant book. These works need to
be brought back into print!

This is GB. I would like to point out that David did not go far enough in
his explanation. It happens that all my work counts as one long poem, and
it includes all of Bromige's work as part of it, along with the work of
Victor Coleman and Drum Hadley.

The suggestion (Steven Scharf and others) that the NY Times put
Galassi's Montale on the cover and gave it a big review (an excellent
one, by the way, by Nick Jenkins!) becauseof his position at Farrar,
Straus and at the Academy of American Poets  is, I think, a cheap shot.

Have you looked at the book?  It's quite fabulous, a labor of love with
incredible and impeccable scholarship that makes a great modernist poet
come alive.  Galassi evidently spent years doing the translation--no
mean feat given his day job!--and I found it mind-blowing and have been
reading it for weeks.  My Italian is rusty but good enough to see that
the translation is really superb.  So what's wrong with the Times
featuring it?  True, they wouldn't do same for a contemporary and we all
know how little attention they pay to the new, but at least they
actually featured a 20th C poet, still not very well known in the U.S.
Shouldn't we be pleased about that?

Is Lee Ann Brown still reading tomorrow afternoon at Sun & Moon?

I went to her reading at the Rose Cafe.  She sang some poems of E.D.'s and her
own, some songs.  Her sampler poem (read aloud) reminded me of a poem in Mary
Leader's _Red Signature_, except it seemed so interesting in Brown's
established context, acrostics like cross stitch. She mentioned the Sun & Moon
reading but I seem to have fallen off the mailing list and wasn't paying
attention if it was posted here.

I was completely blown away by Will Alexander's reading at Beyond Baroque last
night (with Philip Lamantia).  I was impressed with Lamantia as expected, but
Alexander read like the apotheosis of Sun Ra.  He used some words I love, like
"fulminous".  After, I watched something on tv about Monk and slide piano
(Johnson).  The Alexander/Lamantia reading seemed a bit hearing the slide
piano in "Thelonius".  I have missed his readings at Sun & Moon, but also the
panel/conference at LACMA.

        Mark Prejsnar's remarks re the "knownness" of Khlebnikov brought
to mind discussions during the "eyerhymes" Visual Poetry Conference in
1997 with several Ukrainian and Russian visual/sound poets
and with Professor Gerald Jenecek (author of The Look of Russian
Literature and ZAUM which both discuss Khlebnikov and the "lesser known"
giant of Zaum, Kruchonykh)--there was much discussion of how both in the
USA
and Russia/Soviet Union
Mayakovsky was the first to gain fame--then, Khlebnikov
and not yet Kruchonykh--though I hope that Professor Jenecek's book will
change that!)--although for the Russians and Ukrainians he was the most
revered and respected--and in their countries, as in ours, his work is
very
hard to come by, still considered beyond the fringe of knowness, so to
speak--
        A great thanks from  all lovers of Russian poetry to Paul Schmidt
and his brilliant translation of Khlebnikov and his interesting one of
Rimbaud.

 A CALL TO ACTION ON SANCTIONS
 AND THE U.S. WAR AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF IRAQ

 by Noam Chomsky, Edward Herman, Edward Said, and Howard Zinn

 At the end of 1998, the United States once again rained bombs on the people
 of Iraq. But even when the bombs stop falling, the U.S. war against the
 people of Iraq continues through the harsh economic sanctions. This is a
 call to action to end all the war.

 This month U.S. policy will kill 4,500 children under the age of 5 in Iraq,
 according to UN studies, just as it did last month and the month before
 that, all the way back to 1991. Since the end of the Gulf War, at least
 hundreds of thousands -- maybe more than 1 million -- Iraqis have died as a
 direct result of the UN sanctions on Iraq, which are a direct result of
U.S.
 policy.

 This is not foreign policy -- it is sanctioned mass-murder that is nearing
 holocaust proportions. If we remain silent, we are condoning a genocide
that
 is being perpetrated in the name of peace in the Middle East, a mass
 slaughter that is being perpetrated in our name.

 The time has come for a call to action to people of conscience. We are past
 the point where silence is passive consent -- when a crime reaches these
 proportions, silence is complicity. There are several tasks ahead of us.

 First, we must organize and make this issue a priority, just as Americans
 organized to stop the war in Vietnam, and to protest U.S. policies in
 Central America and South Africa. We need a national campaign to lift the
 sanctions.

 This kind of work has already begun, and those efforts need our help. For
 the past several years, individuals and groups have been delivering
medicine
 and other supplies to Iraq in defiance of the U.S. blockade. Now, members
of
 one of those groups, Voices in the Wilderness in Chicago, have been
 threatened with massive fines by the federal government for "exportation of
 donated goods, including medical supplies and toys, to Iraq absent specific
 prior authorization." Our government is harassing a peace group that takes
 medicine and toys to dying children; we owe these courageous activists our
 support.

 Such a campaign is not equivalent to support for the regime of Saddam
 Hussein. To oppose the sanctions is to support the Iraqi people. The people
 are suffering because of the actions of both the Iraqi and U.S.
governments,
 but our moral responsibility lies here in the United States, to counter the
 hypocrisy and inhumanity of our leaders.

 Also, there has been a virtual embargo on news of the effects of the
 sanctions in the mainstream media. For the most part, the American people
do
 not know what evil is being carried out in our name. We must continue to
 apply pressure on journalists at all levels -- from our local papers to the
 network news -- to cover this tragedy. We should overwhelm the major press
 with letters to the editor and put pressure on journalists to cover the
story.

 And we must realize this could be a long struggle. Preparations should
begin
 for all the possible strategies, including civil disobedience once a
 sufficient number of people are committed. Direct action that forces a
moral
 accounting likely is going to be necessary.

 Whatever else we are doing, we should treat this as an emergency and put it
 at the top of our agenda. Existing groups can work on the issue, new groups
 may need to be formed, and national networks need to be built. A good
 central source of information exists on the web at http://leb.net/IAC/.

 Without action by us, the horrors will go on, the children will continue to
 die. We must appeal to the natural sympathies of the American people, who
 will respond if they know what is happening. We must therefore bring this
 issue, in every way we can, to national attention. The only way to avoid
 complicity in this crime is to do everything we can, and much more than we
 have been doing, to end the sanctions on Iraq. This issue must be discussed
 in every household and every public forum across the country.

Marjorie Perloff, through several of her essays, has aroused my
interest in the work of Henri Meschonnic on poetic form.
He's written a lot of books; where to begin?  Is 'Critique du
rythme' the best entry point?

I am primarily interested in issues of the 'ineluctability' of poetic
forms; I take it as a given that Marjorie is right, that we are
somehow constrained to write in certain forms, but what is
the nature of this constraint (philosophically and practically)?

Thanks,
Harold Teichman

Mark Weiss wrote:

Why [else] translate from a language foreign to the reader into a
version of one's own language only marginally understandable to same?


Is the language in which the poets of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries "only marginally understandable"? This question is not
rhetorical. Chaucer's language certainly IS difficult for most. Do you
support the use - in classrooms, say - of the translations of Chaucer
into modern English? Don't we lose Chaucer for losing the specific form
of his language? Would you present Chaucer through Dryden's translations
of some of the Tales? Wouldn't you be painfully aware that you were in
fact presenting Dryden and his age, rather than Chaucer and his?
Nobody would suggest that the Elizabethans should be so rendered
(leaving aside, at least for the moment, the prevalent modernization of
typography, spelling, etc.). Imagine a course on Shakespeare that took
Dryden's rescriptings as primary texts.

"Translation is not replication, and it's not just about text.
Translation translates as well what the reader needs to know about
context, linguistic and otherwise." - M.W.

You are dogmatic, here, and difficult to understand. What I am
suggesting about the use of archaic English is that various foreign
literary traditions can be set into meaningful parallel with the English
tradition, and that, generally speaking, the translation of a
proto-Baroque Polish poet into the idiom of a proto-Baroque English poet
is a reasonable attempt to provide the reader with an analogical insight
into the Polish poet's place in his or her own tradition.

I have to run. I appreciate your response, and we will, I hope, return
to this in more detail.

hello, it's wendy kramer again. i posted a month or two ago, saying i'd
post titles that might be of interest to the list, that are available
from the branch libraries of the new york public library. here (HEAR
hear) are some that
are not yet in the catalog, but will be within the next few weeks, so
y'all can watch for them, and reserve them or check them out as they
appear.

p.s. did i mention in the last post that you can use the library catalog
via the website   www.nypl.org, then click on "catalogs" and choose
"LEO," which is the catalog for the branch libraries?  using your
library card, you can place reserves same as when y're at the library,
plus you can use many of the available databases (click "electronic
resources" at the homepage) from this way.

anyhow, hear are some titles to watch for:

Under the Autumn Star  by Knut Hamsun
My Futurist Years by Roman Jakobson
My Way: Speeches and Poems by Charles Bernstein
Routine Disruptions: Selected Poems & Lyrics 1960-1998 by Kenward
Elmslie
Whatsaid Serif by Nathaniel Mackey

Also, off the top of my head (i.e. no written citations at my side) of
things to watch for that i haven't posted the last few weeks, some not
yet available, some on the shelves:

LeeAnn Brown's book (a thousand pardons, i don't remember the title, &
it's not in yet)

also a new one by Barrett Watten (again, sorry, no title on hand)

The Real Billy the Kid (sorry, my author citation got cut off in the
copier)
but i thot it might be of interest   as it is for me    for spicer fans
et al.

p.p.s. Surrealist Women  ed. penelope rosemont     just came in, &
i've got it checked out for myself right now.  (that's the one i posted
about last time) it looks _scrumptious_, so get in line! i think
mid-manhattan (5th ave at 40th st) owns one too. if you get it,
backchannel me & lemme know what you think!

last comment:  last time i posted "check it out," i got a handful of
backchannels, which i appreciated. let me stress, however, that i am low
on the library food chain, and do not have the power to place items in
the ordering/selection room. in other words, if it ain't already a
choice on my order list, i caint hardly choose it.  so please dont ask
me to buy titles.  the exception to this would be,  of course, that if
there's a title you want in your local branch, go there and request it
from whichever librarian is working at the information desk. She or he
should have request slips for that purpose, or at least a scrap paper
that'll serve the same.

oh, yeah: poetry calendar is available at some branches, free!

best wishes  for feb,

dee

I wrote an essay on David Antin for the Dictionary of Literary Biography
volume 169, which may be of some interest.

The bibliography is generious if not comprehensive; in addition to "The
Principle of Fit," it includes "The Archaeology of Home; Lemons" High
Performance Audio, 1987 -- a recording I am unfamiliar with; Antin himself
added it in proofing.

In addition to the 1975 VORT special issue, I find his essay "Modernism and
Modernity" (Boundary II, 1 Fall 1972: 98-133) and "A Correspondence with the
Editors" (Boundary II, Spring 1975: 595-650) important context.

More widely available: Stephen Fredman's _Poets Prose_; Marjorie Perloff's
_Poetics of Indeterminacy_, and Hank Lazer's _Opposing Poetries_ all contain
smart essays on Antin.

We mustn't forget the long dramatic poems of Francis Berry: Ghosts of
Greenland, and...there's another about an insurrection in Haiti, I believe.
He's an unusual writer.  If anyone knows more about him--if he's still
living--a bibliography, etc.  I'd be interested.  He also wrote an
interesting book in which he attempts to speculate on the in-the-flesh voice
of poets from the "voice" of their poems.  All best Jesse Glass

they charged my visa and send about half the order and then never
answered my calls again. Maybe they were going out of business
right about then. They did have an extensive catalog, and I was all
set to slowly but surely put together a collection.

Ummm, i just haveta weigh in here, with one point, which is obviously both
superficial and crucial:  Her Collected Poems, with which i believe she
had something to do, includes One Life prominently as one of her poems.

You know somewhere one of 'em (is it in CB's A Poetics, in Perelman's
Marginalization, or a more fugative essay, ...?) quotes PL from an
interview, indicating that his ideal would be to write a poem without
words, to have the words disappear, or to have the poem function in such a
way that the language is unimportant and unnoticed by the reader...

This is taken as representative, or rather as exemplary even, of the
mainstream desire for poetry (like fiction) to be "transparent" --for the
language to be as undistinguished and self-effacing as possible.

All of which i agree with;  but it is interesting that PL has at times
been *slightly* more interesting than that...Apart from his quirkily
work-class detroit jewish anarchism, which sure makes him more
insteresting than your run-of-the-mill New Yorker hack, there are (very
fleeting) times when his language doesn't wanna self-efface, albeit many
of these occured a long time ago:  the volume Red Dust, the long poem
Pili's Wall, the title poem of the book They Feed They Lion, etc.  All of
which makes it even more telling that he made the statement about wanting
language to disappear....

Sorry i can't recall *where* this mention takes place...

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

        I had no idea Mr. Bowering was eavesdropping and peeping tomming on
this new list. I thought one reason it had been re-formed, was to keep him
and his sort out. Ok, I fess up, one night when I didnt have the price of a
beer he had me sign a pact that all my writing could be published under the
Bowering logo (moosehead above Carling's brewery and pair of tweed panties
rampant on a field of butts). I am sad to learn that he pulled this one on
Victor Coleman also, Canada's finest lyric poet; one has to admit that GB's
got great taste as a colonizer.

I shall take this matter up with Robert Kroetsch when he reads at UC
Berkeley tomorrow Tues Mar 2 from noon-1:30 p.m.at 13 Boalt Hall sponsored
by UCB's Canadian Studies Program. This event is bag lunch/skull session;
Mr.Kroetsch, a past editor of _Boundary 2_ , will be paired up with Ron
Smith, author of _What Men Know About Women_ (I believe GB was a consultant
on this book). The title of this joint presentation is "Going Nowhere Fast
: Mis/placed Poetics." Hmm. I note that among Kroetsch's many publications
is a book titled _Studhorse Man_ . Perhaps a study of George Bowering?

All this aside, I am glad to welcome George to the newly building list of
The New Epic poets. "Epic or know the reason ewhy" is our motto, and I

I keep feeling it has been a bad year for poetry. And then I realize it
has just begun. I'm hoping it gets better soon. Is it because of the
rabbit? Or can we expect better things to come in this year? Or am I
just jumpy? We have a rabbit calendar in the living room and the furry
rabbit pin-up is in a cage for the months of January and February.

Linda Gregg read earlier in the semester to a packed room. I had to sit
on the floor in the back. She read some poems about some time she had
spent in Greece and about some time she had spent in El Salvador and
about some time she had spent in some other places. She talked about how
when she was little she didn't know she was rich all she knew was that
the sun rose and the sun set on the land and they had horses. She
mentioned Jack Gilbert and Ann Rice and some other people whose names I
forget. Her poems are in the lyrical tradition. A sort of lyrical
tourism. I think she is based in California. She is a mainland poet.

And then I'm having a disillusionment with the local poetry scene
moment. Which isn't fair but I might as well tell about it in an attempt
to rid myself of it once and for all. It started late last year when I
went to a reading organized by the Guerilla Gardeners Union, a splinter
group of the now defunct Wobblies. Gabrielle Welford organizes these
readings and they are lefty events (the last one was a "fundraiser" for
Mumia and Peltier) and community readings. A lot of new writers read and
the emphasis is on work by Pacific Islanders. They are fun events. There
is often a band and some hippies come (unusual on Oahu). As usual a
number of community poets read but the only one that stays in my mind
was a poem that compared colonialism to butt fucking and actually said
that no one could possibly like that. The poet is a well respected
activist lawyer here. I kind of can't get this out of my mind. It took
me a long time to repress it.

But then it all came rushing back last week when I saw Joe Balaz read.
He writes poems in pidgin. Sometimes they are a sort of dramatic
monologue. I enjoy them and find his work often very astute about local
politics. He does visual poems in the Hawaiian language (on the Tinfish
website--good for teaching!). And he has a poem about how Hawai'i is the
mainland to him. He has a poem about getting "kimo-therapy" (Kimo is a
man's name, like Jim; and the poem makes clear that kimo-therapy is a
punch in the mouth.) He seems to be turning himself into a sort of
performance poet. Like he had props and a lighting staff. He would put
on a certain hat and then the light would come on and then he would
recite his poem. He unfortunately acted out the woman's voices as high
squeaky ones. And once he acted out an old man (and the lights got all
dark) for a poem about the last squid. But he read a poem about a naked
man on the beach who propositions the narrator and then the narrator
beats him with a baseball bat size stick (Balaz picked up a stick he had
on stage and demonstrated a hit crotch high). The poem has a tight rhyme
and is supposed (I think) to be silly. I say "narrator" but it isn't
really a dramatic monologue. It reads in that universal poetry voice.

So I'm trying to figure out the sexuality stuff and not be all weird
about it and say generic things about the local scene but I'm having
trouble ignoring it and being accepting of it. I keep wondering about
the crowd's laughter at the Balaz piece. And yet not really knowing what
exactly the proper response is either. And not even being sure of the
point of the poem (unlike the wrongness of that equation between
colonialism and butt fucking). But I'm still feeling sensitive about
those bumper stickers that say save traditional marriage.

But I went to a good series of talks at the Center for Hawaiian Studies
a few nights ago. It was on mele ku'e (songs of protest). One song had
the line "the greatest of all women are Queen Emma and Queen Victoria."
Queen Emma apparently sided with the Brits against the Amer. There was
some good hula. And Amy Gillian (a pop local singer) sang some songs she
had had translated into Hawaiian. One was about the H3 highway
controversy and another was about walking into the Iolani Palace. Some
guy did a talk on a mele that compared a missonary guy to an over ripe
bannana. It had a lot of good metaphors in about how stupid the man was.
And then a guy fom Sudden Rush (a local rap group) sang and talked also.
He talked nervously and nonstop and made all these jokes. One was knock
knock; who's there?; a portugee burglar. He said he could tell this joke
b/c he is Portugese also. The event was fun b/c it made the univ seem
alive and in touch with the community to have popular singers taken
seriously at a conference on mele ku'e. Apparently Huanani Kay Trask is
the one that has made the word ku'e such a rally cry. She found it a
mele that some people did a hula to that was about the militia that
tried to regain power after Queen L. was kicked out by the haole junta.

And then Roy Miki and Ashok Mathur were just here. They are from Canada.
Ashok once did a prairie asians tour in Canada. Roy edits West Coast
Line. They had just come from Australia. It was interesting talking to
them and about experimental poetry and race issues. They read at a
Coffee shop. During the reading people kept walking between the reader
and the audience to go to the bathroom. They were all carrying a child's
shoe with a key on it and for some reason they refused to not interupt
the reading. The reading was good and fun. I especially liked the poems
Ashok read from his book _Loverauge_. The audience was very small. I had
kind of hoped more people would come b/c Roy has done all this work on
the Canadian internment of Japanese-Canadians during WWII and there is a
lot of talk here about the U.S. internment. I had hoped the Japanese
activist connection would bring out writers from that community. But
alas. Among the few present, there was a lady who comes to all the
readings here. She asked Bill if he knew what the price of chicken was.
And she told me that she was calling California to see if the price of
gas had gone down any around here (there is a lawsuit happening here
about gas companies price fixing and inflating the cost of gas--it is
around $1.50 per gallon; Bill doesn't know the price of chicken but it
is probably high also). We went out after the reading and all drank
really dark beers and talked. The talk was about curriculum and
postcolonialism and, as always, Hawai'i. One person said that Ben
Cayetano should just go back to the Philippines, where he came from (I
think he was born here but I'm not sure). That comment made the rest of
us nervous but no one said anything.

Today Roy and Ashok gave a talk at the English Dept. Ashok read some
excerpts from his dissertation on two emerging Indian-Canadian (or is
that S.E. Asian-Canadian?) writers whose names I didn't write down and
so don't remember but who seemed very interesting and fun. Roy talked a
lot about the commodification of minority writing in Canada. The
audience was very small. 1/9 of the potential audience had fainted
before the talk and another 1/9 had gone with him to the hospital. I
felt kind of annoyed at the smallness of the audience (not at the guy
who fainted; him I'm worried about) b/c there are a lot of people in my
dept who teach and/or study Asian-American literature and I felt they
shoulda been interested in what our Northern neighbors are up to. That
is the scolding evil side of me that is really just the side of me that
longs for cross ocean and land mass communities, no more colonialism
ever, and yet more butt fucking overall.

Going to California?

I have a friend who is an editor at a prominent writerly magazine that has
recently been redesigned.  She is looking for someone to write 1,000 clear,
admiring words about the Page Mothers conference and its participants.  She
will pay you.  Lots of people will read it.  You'd be doing the conference
good.  Please come forward.  Journalistic or reviewing experience, as they
say, would be a big plus.

The admiring part was my idea but I'm certain it is an apt one.

If you are a panelist it does not, I would guess, disqualify you -- new
journalism, etc.

Backchannel ASAP -- thanks -Mike

I hope that Bay Area folk, at least, get/got to the Kroetsch and Smith
reading at Berkeley, and that someone can report on it. Kroetsch is, in my
opinion, the most interesting living Can. writer up here, and Smith is one
of two poets I know who claim to be good golfers.

As to Bromige. I want it understood that while I write his poems, I do not
write his letters.

From Jennifer Bosveld, at Pudding House (who is doing my next book)
mailto:pudding@johnstown.net

* Willie Abraham Howard Jr. burned out in Atlanta area fire. We're
publishing his book, Memorial Drive, and that's where his apartment
burned Monday Feb. 22 while he was at work. His writings only got
drenched and have been hanging out to dry on a friend's porch. But
almost everything else is gone. His Smith Corona typewriter is a plastic
blob. He was already living on little. He wants no sympathy. He sees
only love and blessings and an opportunity for change. He is an amazing
human being and I love him dearly. Will you help me help him? Alex
Haley, it is clear to me, was about to thrust a spotlight on Willie, but
Haley died. We're publishing his chapbook--a far cry from the attention
Haley could have created. Willie's trying to get resettled. Let's shower
him with $5 bills. Can you send ONE? or more? Why don't we do something
really fantastic for this young writer who NEVER spends his money in the
wrong place. He's a great father, has a strong work ethic, is a super
person. He was FEATURED POET in Pudding Magazine a few issues back. Do
sign a note to him please. It makes people crazy not to know the names
of the people who do nice things. Just tell him you're a writer in
support. Or whatever you want to say. The $30 KMart voucher the fire
victims got means EVERYTHING to him. Can you imagine? If you do this, it
WILL came back to bless you 10-fold because "there is no giving anything
away." No matter how much you send him it will bless YOU as much as HIM.
I promise. I know, because I'm a goddess [god] just like YOU. Let's
create. Let's make this day of creation one from the poets. Go without
lunch. Forget the 6-pack. Whatever. For five minutes, I ask you to
please put down the new Donald Hall book, drop everything and send a
note to

WILLIE ABRAHAM HOWARD JR, 3850 Memorial Drive #C7, Decatur, Georgia
30032.

With a little gift in it. I'm also trying to figure out a way to get him
a computer, which goddess Cathy Callaghan stuffed money in my pocket for
last night at Larry's Poetry Forum when she heard me talking about this.
If you have a recommendation about how I should go about selecting a
cheap but no-clunker computer or facilitating this, please enlighten me.
Thank you for joining in doing something for someone who least expects
it. --Jen

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

The Poetics List was founded by Charles Bernstein in late 1993
with the epigraph above. Now in its second incarnation, the list
carries over 600 subscribers, though all of these subscribers do
not necessarily receive messages at any given time. A number of
other people read the Poetics List via our web archives at the
Electronic Poetry Center (see section 9 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. Due to the
increasing number of subscribers, we are no longer able to
maintain the open format with which the list began. All
submissions are reviewed by the moderator in keeping with
the goals of the list, as articulated in this Welcome Message.
We remain committed to this editorial function as a defining
element of the Poetics List. Our aim is to support, inform,
and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to
innovations, renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as
content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and
to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 5
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 10.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 7
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the editors, write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your real name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list must provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all of
the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, simply re-subscribe to the list
(once your account problem has been resolved!) by sending
this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Submissions

The Poetics List is a =3Dfully moderated=3D list. All submissions
are reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the
list as articulated in this Welcome Message (see section 1).
Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetics, messages relating to politics and political news
will also be considered. All correspondence with the editors
regarding submissions to the list remains confidential and
should be directed to <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Also welcome are other sorts of news, e.g.,
event reports, obituaries, and reading lists (annotated or not).

Queries may be posted to the list when deemed appropriate;
we request that the posting subscriber assemble "highlights"
from respondents' posts to be published to the list.

Solicited submissions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) may
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The editors reserve the
right to contact any subscriber regarding possible submissions.

Posts to the Poetics List should abide by the rules of "Fair Use"
when quoting material for which the posting subscriber does not
hold copyright. Please do not post to the list personal or
"backchannel" correspondence, or other unpublished material,
without the express permission of the author!

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a
whole, or supply information missing from an post, or thank
someone for posting something you requested, please send the
request or comment directly to that individual, and not to the
list editors.

Send messages to the list directly to the list address:

     <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

When sending to the list, please send only "plain text". Note,
however, there is no problem with sending clickable URLs in
HTML format.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents in a post, since this may make it difficult for
those who get the list via "digest" or who cannot decode
attached or specially formatted files. The use of "styled"
text or HTML formatting in the body of email posts to the
list appears not to be compatible with the the list's
automatic digest program; as a result such messages disrupt
the format of the Digest, even though this coding is
readable for some subscribers who do not use the digest
option.

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the editors at
<POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

As an outside maximum, we will accept for publication to
Poetics no more than 5 messages a day from any one subscriber;
in general, we expect subscribers to keep their post to less
than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers) of twenty or
fewer messages per day.

For further information or to contact the editors, please
write to <POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

4. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Please do not publish list correspondence without the express
permission of the author! Copyright for all material posted on
Poetics remains with the author; material from this list and its
archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Please
do not bother submitting such messages to the editor. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat
offenders will be removed from the list immediately. Please do
not put this policy to test!

-------------------

5. Digest Option

The Listserve program gives you the option to receive all the
posted Poetics message each day as a single message. If you
would prefer to receive ONE message each day, which would
include all messages posted to the list for that day, you can
use the digest option.

Send this one-line message, with no "subject" line to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics digest

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this
message:

     set poetics mail

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

     set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 8 below.)

-------------------

7. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

-------------------

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://writing.upenn.edu/epc>.

Our mission is to serve as a hypertextual gateway to the
extraordinary range of activity in formally innovative writing in
the United States and around the world. The Center provides access
to the burgeoning electronic resources in new poetries including
RIF/T and many other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS List
archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts and
bibliographies, and direct connections to numerous related
electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides information about
contemporary print little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in
poetry and poetics. And we have an extensive collection of
soundfiles of poets reading their work, as well as the archive of
LINEbreak, the radio interview series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

-------------------

9. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://writing.upenn.edu/epc>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to
<http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive>.

You may browse the Poetics List archives by month and year or
search them for specific information. Your interface will allow
you to print or download any of these files.

-------------------

10. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: The Electronic Poetry Center listings of
poetry and poetics information is open and available to you. We
are trying to make access to printed publications as easy as
possible for our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate!

Send a list of your press/publications to
<glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu>, with the words EPC Press Listing in
the subject line.

You may also send materials on disk. (Write file name, word
processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail
message to the address above to obtain a mailing address to
which to send your disk. Though files marked up with html are
our goal, ascii files are perfectly acceptable. If your word
processor will save files in Rich Text Format (.rtf) this is
also highly desirable.

Send us extended information on new publications (including any
back cover copy and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs or
backlists (including excerpts from reviews, sample poems, etc.).
Be sure to include full information for ordering--including prices
and addresses and phone numbers both of the press and any
distributors.

You might also want to send short announcements of new publications
directly to the Poetics List as subscribers do not always (or ever)
check the EPC; in your message please include full  information for
ordering. If you have a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention
that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have
received a noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to
promote your publication and we are glad to facilitate information
about interesting publications.

Oh for God's sake man The Collected Poems includes a section called From
ONE LIFE, which does indeed present many poems from the book called ONE
LIFE, which is about the life and times of Wendell Willkie.  Some of these
poems are called "WILLKIE -- STOPLESS FALLING THROUGH AIR," and "Radio
silence of aircraft over the dense ocean," and Rang and rang, rang in a
small boy's head," and even "My name Is Tommy Torin," but there is no long
poem called ONE LIFE.  So stop about it now.  Enough.=20

I just wanted add to Heather Thomas's list of readings in
the hometown of Wallace Stevens, Byron Vazakas, Baziotes,
and, yikes, Updyke...
a blatant
self-promotion--
ON APRIL 21st, 1999, I will be returning to my alma matter, Albright
College, to read poetry in the very same "south lounge" of the
"campus center" where I learned to play piano.
I even think my book, STEALER'S WHEEL (HARD PRESS, 1999), might very
well be out by then....

The long poem is alive & well, a life's work lived & written thru.
History prefigures the outcome, the epickal outlasts any distant
memories that words fall short of.  From which hospital will you rewrite

Thanks for the tolerance.

Lee Ann Brown read well, sang again, read poems quite differently selected
from _Polyverse_, but still a cohesive, performative, revelatory whole at Sun
& Moon,

the new Buck a Book for the Miracle Mile?

Not quite, and I still owe $5 to the press.  But do go there, perhaps with

I do believe that was Saul Bellow who said this, not Levine. And I
suspect that I'm the one who cited SB to that effect, tho, since I'm at
work and Bromige & Billy Little have yet to complete the concordance of
my critical texts, I can't tell you where...

But it weren't Phil (Not This Pig) Levine, unless he made the same gaffe
independently.

Some staging notes responsive to RF's website posted 2/27.

Window and door and a cup and a cloud and a phone and a table and tree,
who could you find to find them for you?  Somebody who thinks they know
how to run the show says these are props. I said I didn't know what
props were or what they were for.  Here they are words that float and
rest for a moment among pairs of voices, there are only a few of them,
you wouldn't need to ask a whole lot of people to be the voices, not the
objects, the voices are never objects here, eluding objectification,
could they even bear to be identified by the body of the actor?  These
voices are outside the thingness of the words for the objects that are
images, not props, but image-objects.
        How can you see them without a camera?
        How can you stage them without a camera?
        Richard Foreman's new writing for the theater abolishes cinema.
        There can be no light tricks.  There needs to be natural light only,
coming in through the loft or gallery window like the one at Canessa
Park.  The play(s) would then need to take place across a 24 hour
period.  Natural light falling on words for image-objects which I don't
know if they should be spoken by live speakers.  RF writes that he used
tapes a long time ago, before William Dafoe.  Maybe the actors whose
bodies the voices are supposed to coming out of need at least to begin
mutely, as a gesture to Kattrin (RF's Brecht).  The words would surround
the live speakers, and they would fall toward them, and the action would
be the actors trying to find the words with their mouths, and the
v-effect of it would not be coming from anything more monumental than
the recognition that the simplest words for things and thoughts and
feelings like the "I love you" these speakers say would materialize
through an unprecedented intersubjectivity, one endless day and night in
which the Poem can be heard departing from its graphic site, paper or
screen, and returning to the fragile acoustics of the interreal, which
sounds to those outside it to be the doubly unreal.
        Richard Foreman's new writings tell me there is a human voice.
        It is both one and not-one together for the many who are without a
voice.  There is also a child's garden of verses here, for the children
our government is killing in Iraq.
         Does RF suggest in an essay that he was "pandering to the masses" (his
own title) when in one show two naked women on roller skates bent over
to bare their asses to the audience?
        They called this pornography.  Guys and dolls.
        In RF's new writings it is the kiss that shocks to be shown, an action
that could it be represented, and I don't think it can, might tear the
viewer between her critical detachment-position and her body's
involuntary, reflexive wet.

All - Since we've never compiled a FAQ for this list,
I've decided to send out the Welcome Message or some
version thereof periodically (this time by hand - I'll
see about having it automated in future). The point is
simply to remind subscribers of the main focus of the
Poetics List etc.

Things seem to be going well around here - I appreciate
everyone's patience with the mailhub failure last month;
all of the fallout from that problem has been cleared
away. In particular, I want to thank everyone for not
inundating me with questions etc. in what I know was
probably a time of at least irritating uncertainty. Well,
it was for me, anyway.

Thanks, too, for helping to keep the list manageable. As
most of you probably realize, moderating the PL isn't my
full-time job; that's why messages are forwarded only
once or twice a day. The closer we stay to list topics -
with the occasional welcome diversions, of course - the
easier it is for me to keep up with the list.

A few small requests:

# Please remember to excerpt selectively from previous
  posts. By so doing, you could help save the vision or
  lower the blood pressure of our fine digest subscribers.
  Anyway, internet access may be 'free' for some of us, but
  ultimately words = bits = electricity = natural resources.

# Remember to clearly state the date, time, and location
  (incl. the city and/or country as applicable) in reading/event
  announcements.


        thanks, Chris

Ron --

Mark Twain already dubbed the Long Island farmer on board the Quaker City
the "poet lariat" in The Innocents Abroad.  His poems were of
extraordinary terribleness approaching the sublime -- and the actual
character published them after the trip.  I don't remember his name right
now, but I think the book was "Poems of a Long Island Farmer."  In any
case, I suppose Twain would let you be the next poet lariat -- but you
would have to write such horrible stuff that it would be wonderful.  Are
you up for it?

Although I'm generally sympathetic to critques of the ideology of
"transparency" in language, I have to admit I do have a sort of nagging
reservation on this point.  Maybe "transparency" isn't the right word, but
there's a certain kind of experience I've had in reading poetry where the
sense of contact is so immediate that the word does, in some sense, seem
to have "disappeared."   It's not my "usual" way of reading, and it has
nothing to do with the Stephen King sort of transparency, and I suppose it
tends to come at moments that are in some way epiphanic.  It also--here's
the paradox--requires supreme attention to language on the author's part.
It isn't easy to think of an example off the top of my head--and it wld
probably be impossible to point to specific lines anyway, since what I'm
talking about probably has more to do with a certain reading *state*,
something perhaps related to a spell or trance.  Moments in Whitman, or
Reznikoff, or Neruda come to mind...

Anybody else go along with this?  steve

A student of mine needs to learn as much as she can about the 1963 Vancouver
poetry conference as quickly as possible for a class report.  What are the
best sources?  Everything I've picked up on the event has been culled from
biographies and pieces of interviews.  Thanks in advance.

Silliman "remembers" only after Little-Bromige forward their files of his
"Uncompleted [R.Silliman] " concordance. He also appears to have raided
Billy's joke book ("for the "poet-lariat" quip). Anyway, I am really
posting only because I'm afraid my last b-c to you, R Silliman, didnt go
thru; I had posted it to one of those forbidden eddresses, not out of my
usual sense of mischief, but my usual sense of inadvertance. Ron, if you
are listening, could you let me know to what edress to forward? Thanks, and
thanks all for putting up with this intrusion (given that you have)> David.

thanks for that lovely phrase.  it begins to get at what i find so
appealing about "doggerel," especially on a subject of emotional importance
to the writer.  it's been hard for me to get across to folks why this stuff
is significant to me and why i want to write about it, but this phrase

This post shamelessly copied from a bbs.  The line about the reasons the woman played half-naked caught me....

eryque

From _The Guinness Book of Music Facts and
Feats_.  It's the side of music they try not to teach us.  The subject is, "The
Longest Instrumental Work." It's about a piece by Satie titled Vexations.
Here's part of the article...

"It consists of a 52 beat unbarred idea, with the indication 'Tres lent,'
played 840 times with as little variation as possible. The first performance,
organised by John Cage at the Pocket Theatre, New York, in 1963, lasted 18
hours and 12 minutes and was performed by a group of ten pianists in relay.
Since then there have been many other performances: the second was in Berlin
during August 1966 at which a relay of six pianists took part: for her second
stint Charlotte Moorman introduced a novel way of breaking the monotony by
appearing unclothed from the waist up. Her reasons were both musicological
and financial: Satie, it is said, " loved nudity", and John Cage bet her $100
she wouldn't do it. On this occasion the performance of the music took 18
hours and 40 minutes."

...it goes on to mention a performance done in England (I think) that took
24 hours, by one performer... and another that was done in Australia, another
attempt to play the whole thing by one performer, that had to end after only
17 hours - the performer was taken to hospital in a coma.

Gerrit Lansing last night at the Poetry Project. No one should've missed

A great reed boat dropped him off at the lectern, a flock of seraphim took

Joanne Kyger was next, a welcome blast of Bolinas beachlounging--the

glasses she wore were actually satellite dishes picking up the quiet
descriptive transmissions that eventually appears in the pomes. Damn fine

What's wrong with the Steven King sort of transparency? I do believe it is
not unconnected to the later "trance, or spell" that you refer to in the
sense that there is undeniably something freakishly supernatural about
subjectivity when it seems objective. Assuming that's what you meant by
Steven King sort of transparency.

Let me back up: could someone just give me a short treatise on past
critiques of "transparency"; what's the trope?

i think that Steven is on to something here that i often think about (even
write about) - & too don't know that 'transparency' is the best word for it

for me, my early experiences of listening to Cage's Etudes Australes had
somethingof this effect in another medium - but i think i've had similar
experiences with even the most material of reading; Finnegans Wake, Tender
Buttons, "A"-22/23 - i think that what Steven is getting at is something
like what Charles Peirce was talking about when he spoke of "firstness"

perhaps this only seems like an epiphany b/c most of our time is spent in
other senses of relationship to the world/ourselves

i've been persuing some of these types of questions with the particpants in
Peirce-L - specifically i brought up Pound's famous 'three types of poetry'
[melo- phano- logo-] and explored the analogy to Peirce's categories - other
members of Peirce-L suggested using his semeiotic instead of his categories
w/relation to Pound - i'm pursuing that at present

when I think "transparent poet" and "dissappearing words" this morning I
think Notley, whose long poems get very trance-like, and who, according to
her 1992 intro to _the Scarlet Cabinet_, a co-collection of texts with
Douglas Oliver, wants to get back to "essences," to be "invisible" so as to
stop filling the world with more "man-made" material (she calls it
"detritus" and I think lovingly of very "opaque" (but not dense or
in-sensible) material-cluttered poems -- But even Stein can be read
"transparently").

maybe the problem with the word "transparency" is it's too value-laden and
implies that the artifice it's meant to conceal is negative ("oh she's so
transparent").  Notley prefers "invisible" as opposed to the non-visible, &
mabye Steven, this is close to what you're getting at.  Notley's "escape" to
the invisible is not an escape to the transparent "self" -- the "I" that so
many self-posessed lyrics assume, but to the "air" -- the group of the oral
tradition, a medium that's so "transparent" that it's not visible, yet so
utterly "visible" that it doesn't need (written) words!  Incredible!

So, what's "wrong" with King in this context:
made-for-t.v./mediation/cluttered commercial time vs. made-for-people/in
Notley's ideal unmediated -- "Things must be thouht out & saved in the air
[and not on the air-waves], in order to do less harm to the world"

As for critique Marjorie Perloff's "Against Transparency" would be an
obvious place to start  (published in her 1991 collection _Radical
Artifice_)

Subject:      Levine on transparency

Sorry I've forgotten who it was who asked for Phil Levine references--but
anyway, the passage that Mark Prejsnar mentions (the desire for a poem where
the words are invisible) is indeed from a Levine interview, and it's cited in
the middle of a couple of pages on Levine in Marjorie Perloff's *Radical
Artifice.*  Far be it from me to correct Ron on his own oeuvre, but I don't
think he cites it in "Disappearance of the Word," though granted he does
mention Saul Bellow as a novelist of the disappeared or invisible word.  (OK,
"near be it to me," since I've just done it.)

Subject:      McNaughton in Seattle, Vancouver
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

Billy Little recently nominated  Duncan McNaughton's "Black Spoon" for the
long poem list that was going around recently. Here's a snippet:
____________________________________________________________
some bugle to wake up the nation
some furious trumpet to wake up the town
what they used to call the city
when they used to call it pretty
now it's dirty from its tuque
to its boot

                it only needs to shake off the dust
dusty ash from a smoking moon
fallen dusty ash
                                from some burned-out suns

that's why spirit weeps at the crossroads
that's why lips glisten with tears
that's why she cut out su lengua
when she opens her mouth to sing she makes
the sound of water gurgling down a harsh drain

Federico asked to pin a gaudy
                orange pomegranate flower
                                to her black tunic of mail
he brought a smile to her lips glistening with tears

sus labios                      reluciendo
                                                con lagrimas

                les fontaines de jouvence
some old negro gardener who tends that tree
up and down San Antonio ya se va
by the name of Khidr
                                he plays that long slender flute

that ney of Konya
which echoes inside some tomb

        its emerald roof domed against an ice blue sky

__________________________________________________________

Since Valparaiso (where that poem appears) was published in 1995, Duncan has
published three more books, Kicking the Feather, The Wrapped Church, and the
new another set / of circumstance  from hawkhaven press in San Francisco.
Bob Creeley recently commented, somewhat incredulously, that an audience for
McNaughton's work was still slow in forming. Residents of or visitors to the
Pacific Northwest will soon have a chance to add themselves to that rare
group, as Duncan will be reading in Seattle (with Joe Safdie) on Tuesday,
March 16 at

Open Books
2414 N. 45th St.
7:00 PM

and three days later in Vancouver, at 8 PM, where he'll be delivering a
lecture at Capilano College, previously advertised on this list. ("In this
lecture Duncan McNaughton will discuss the relationship between poetry,
history, and geography, arguing there is no history without geography, and
that poetry as a form is central to contemporary thought. He will read from
and
speak to the work in his most recent book, another set / of circumstance.
(hawkhaven).")

That's in Room 148, Cedar Building, Capilano College, 2055 Purcell Way,
North Vancouver

All within possible reach of these events are encouraged to show themselves
at the respective doors . . .

Subject:      REVIEW of "difference/indifference" -  Roth &  Katz
Comments: To: silence <silence@lists.realtime.net>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

[silence] / poetix

are (m)any of you familiar with this book ?
_difference/indifference musings on postmodernism, marcel duchamp and john
cage_
introduction and text by Moira Roth, commentary by Jonathan D. Katz

i found it troubling

in the abstract i think these sorts of inquiry are quite valid and ought to
be pursued in the service of increasing out knowledge and understanding of
artistic (& other sorts of) figures

Roth's piece on Duchamp as "dandy" is interesting and has a certain amount
of explanatory force - her paper entitled "The Aesthetic of Indifference"
which focuses on Cage, Rauschenberg, Cunningham, Johns and Duchamp as
precursor/model
        the thesis seems to be that "indifference" - toward politics -
toward social issues - etc - was a front for having no way to respond to the
repressive climate of the 50s/coldwar/McCarthy etc
        her study also seems to take for granted that an historical
explanation is not only called for, or revealing in some ways, but The
Explanation
        she talks about Rauschenberg's *White Paintings* and speaks of
Cage's 'haiku-like response' to them - here is the Cage text she cites (in
abbreviated form? it's from Kostelanetz ed. _John Cage_ p.111 - i haven't
had the chance to check it out yet);

        To whom
        No subject
        No image
        No taste
        No object
        No beauty
        No message
        No talent
        No technique (no why)
        No idea
        No intention
        No art
        No feeling...

Roth calls this "an unconscious tragic acknowledgement of total paralysis"
(p.41) next she says "Cage would object to such an interpretation. He would,
I believe, argue that the denial of conventional meaning was in order to
allow a different sort of meaning to emerge: that he was interested in the
4'33" piece, for example, in getting the audience to make music/sound rather
than merely listen passively. But the negativity and passivity of such works
cannot be disassociated from the historical moment at which they were
produced." (ibid)
        the 1st thing that jumps out is the "getting the audience to make
music/sound rather than merely listen" - is she saying 'make music' in the
sense of 'find the music in the sounds occuring' or is she suggesting people
hum or beat on chairs ? ignoring that qualm, how is the music negative and
passive if it's also a call for people to act, to attend to sound, as an
irreducible thing (& thus a positive) - as to whether things can be
disassociated from their historical moment - i'd argue that they *can* and
in fact *are* daily - whether this is a *good* thing or just a fact i don't
mean to say (as i don't know)

Katz disputes Roth's reading of an "aethetic of indiference" and contrasts
his of a "Politics of Negation" and recuperates the same complex of actions
attitudes etc as a queer strategy in a straight hegemony - this reading
(especially re Johns) i found initially much more interesting - only to be
troubled by other things
        Katz (p.148);
" Cage sought, in his words "to just erase the difference between art and
life.
        Through the trope of silence, Cage thought he had found one such
eraser. But if we examine closely the validity of this claim, we will find
that it didn't quite work out as Cage would have us believe. The efficacy of
Cage's silence as an aesthetic trope is in fact entirely dependant on its
distinctly artistic context. Outside the concert hall, silence just doesn't
sound the same. Given that in art and liofe there are separate signifying
environments for silence, it follows then that we have to recognize a
distinction between Cage's theory of silence annd the everyday practice of
it--art, in short, is different from life.
        While it is certainly true that Cage advocated an erasure of this
distinction, it is equally true that he didn't succeed. As I see it, he
couldn't have; no one can. Context seems to be a determinant,and art, even
art that claims its identity with life, simply can't will it away."

Katz then moves thru the possibilities that postmodernism offers suggesting
that he could 'deconstruct these art/life, theory/praxis binaries, and
argue...in favor of the mutual implicativeness of these terms' - he decides
against this as he judges that the binaries do important work and because
contesting terms that he uses would be 'disingenuous'.
        next he exercises another route to "mitigate this life/art
distiction through refernce to Cage's works themselves" - saying that
perhapos Cage's work canot be properly confined to the realm of art - this
notion he feels is dashed by "an even glancing acquaintence with Cage
studies" which shows that such interests are "what we can agree to call,
with suitable embarassment, 'high culture,' a term used precisely for its
ability to mark a difference from everyday life" (p.149)
        "Thus in the face of our objections--themselves inspired in part by
Cage's own visions--is it the case that his art does remain ineffably
different from life and his theory from his practice? Or at least, in the
ordinary world where all of us actually live? And is any attempt to deny
this difference at best false consciousness, and at worst a seducton away
from the materialist realities of an often inequitable social practice
toward the seductive phantasm of an art utopia." (ibid.)

these passages and the whole of this book seems based on a misunderstanding
of what silence means for Cage, Katz writes "silence is thematized, made
palpable as a silencing." (p.53) - does this make any sense as a description
of the one's experinec of 4'33' ? - i think not
        Katz wants to be able to treat Cage's music and ideas as 'objects
suitable for subsequent analysis' (Cage) instead of registering that they
are processes that take place in the 'ordinary world where all of us
actually live' - his inability to see that 4'33' is (or could be) still
going on - is not bounded by its time markings - is why his otherwise very
perceptive analysis sails past its object

someplace i read a paper about Duchamp's Three Standard Stoppages - the
author pointed out that three were *needed* - one wd be an alternate - two
an either/or - but three, three was the beginning of multiplicity - Katz, in
his feints toward deconstruction (when it serves his argument) illustrates a
tendancy toward and then away from One and Two - but like a binary that Cage
accepted; object/process, and those Katz seems to feel are 'disingenuous'
not to continue using; art/life, theory/practice - i wd like to suggest that
our experience is never monadic, rarely dyadic, but resolutely triadic  - a
fact that allows us to use terms like art and life and have no need to take
issue with binaries at all

but there are interesting things in the book other than these articles i've
had so much trouble with - interviews with Vito Acconci, Robert Smithson,
George Segal and Cage as well as a piece by Roth on the art of Shigeko
Kubuto that has me interested learn more

finally i wonder - on page 48 there is aphotograph of "a serious game of
skee-ball in Dillon's Bar" - identified in the caption are Johns, Anna
Moreska, Rauschenberg, Cunningham and Cage - but there is another figure -
between Moreska and Johns - November 10, 1959 - could that over-exposed
forehead mark Frank O'Hara ?

Poetry that performs itself: Cyberpoetry at the State Library

 Renowned Melbourne-born poet Komninos Zervos has just commenced a unique new
project as
 Cyberpoet in Residence at Experimedia at the State Library.

 Komninos is one of Australia's most popular performance poets whose most recent
work uses colour,
 movement, sound and text to create cyberpoetry, an exciting new kind of poetry
accessible via the
 Internet.

 The ten week project, cyberpoet@slv, is the first to be supported by Arts
Victoria's 'Incubator', an
 innovative program that encourages artists to explore the creative possibilities of
multimedia technology.

 'Over the past four years I've been keen to develop a poetry that performs itself.
The multimedia Internet
 provides the perfect vehicle for my text animations. Cyberpoetry moves in time and
space¾it can't be
 published in traditional print media but it's true to the principles of poetry with
words evoking images.'

 Through cyberpoet@slv Komninos will compile an online database of contemporary
Victorian poets and
 poetry for the State Library of Victoria. He will also create a poetry zine,
working with thirty of the poets
 to present 'cyber' versions of their poems¾sharing his skills with local writers.

 Victorian poets are invited to contact Komninos to register their interest and be
included in the
 database. They are also welcome to visit him at the Library to see his work and
discuss ideas for
 producing multimedia poetry.

 The cyberpoet Website will be launched publicly at the State Library on 5 March
with a performance by
 Komninos and a special guest appearance by Mark Amerika, well known Hypertext
online digital
 novelist.

 Komninos can be contacted by telephone 03 9669 9786, email cyberpoet@slv.vic.gov.au
or fax 03 9669
 9958.

 Examples of cyberpoetry can be found on Komninos's site at
http://student.uq.edu.au/~s271502/.

 The project Web site is www.experimedia.vic.gov.au/cyberpoet/

 Komninos Zervos is available for interview.

I have to say I was very torn but Monica won.  Monica has been an
important cultural event for me.  Monica has no trouble merging her
politics with her poetry. I am not joining my voice to those facile
mockers; I seriously support this woman who has been so railroaded by
the most powerful people in the country and has not only maintained a
level of grace in her beautiful zaftig body, but is willing to speak
abortion to america, in this dangerous climate.  And the line about Bill
Clinton's teary eyes is priceless.

        Those of you who will be in Washington, D.C. are welcome to join
us on Sunday, March 7 at 8 p.m. at Bridge Street Books (2814 Pennsylvania
Ave. NW, next to The Four Seasons Hotel in Georgetown, near the corner of
Pennyslvania and M) for a reading by BOB PERELMAN and MARK WALLACE.


        BOB PERELMAN is the author of ten books of poetry, including the
recently published _The Future of Memory_. _Virtual Reality_, _Face
Value_, and _The First World_.
        He has also authored two influential critical studies _The Trouble with
Genius: Reading Stein, Joyce, Pound, and Zukofsky_ and _The Marginalization of
Poetry: Language Writing and Literary History_. A poet of wit, politics, and
passion. John Ashbery writes of Perelman: "Most poets define poetry by
creating it. Bob Perelman creates it by defining it, and is thus one step
ahead of all the poets under the sun, one step closer to colliding with Zeno's
vanishing point, to merging coyote with road runner, to winning the hand."


        MARK WALLACE is the author of a number of books of poetry, most
recently _Nothing Happened and Besides I Wasn't There_ and _Sonnets of a
Penny-a-Liner_. His book _Temporary Worker Rides A Subway_ won the 1998
New American Poetry Award and is forthcoming from Sun and Moon. He's going
to read some poems but also preview some sections from a novel, _Dead
Carnival_, which, with its mindless, loping, zombie-like gait has been
following him relentlessly for most of the past decade.

you cd find much of the argument against transparency in Silliman (someplace
in THE NEW SENTANCE) and Bernstein ("The Artifice of Absorption" in
APOETICS) also in Andrews' critical stuff someplace

the idea in brief (and thus with potentially large distortions - my
apologies to the makers of these arguments) is; that, seemingly transparent
language is used to report on the world, represent the way-things-are, etc -
b/c of its transparency, its hiding of it's constructedness and ideological
assumptions, it is used as tool to maintain power, status quo, etc
        the issue then becomes - is Stephen King supporting the powers that
be thru his use of this "transparent" mode - and the answers differ
depending - i think Andrews wd say yes

i suspect that in some of these formulations that too much emphasis is
placed on the power of form - the 'politics of poetic form' to use the title
so well known

Just got your message on Monday morning. Yes, Lee Ann
Brown read at Sun & Moon Press yesterday--a wonderful reading
and great conversation.

On March 20th, 4:00 p.m. Fanny Howe and her daughter, Danzy
Senna will both read from their new novels. This should be
quite an event. Please feel free to attend if you're in
the area. The salons are held monthly at 6026 Wilshire Blvd.,
Los Angeles, CA 90036

Aldon Nielsen's VEXT  is vexing indeed, as only poetry that rubs you all the
right ways can be. The lyric here is taken to the mat. Only to be declared
the winner. Enter pathos.

"But this

This particular sweetness

Was not then
To be had."
("Imputation")

Till slapstick makes the most of its numerous cameos.

"We've got a bad code
And we can't seem to shake it."
("Language - Nudity - Violence")

Has Nielsen "gone Hollywood"? VEXT frolics with the rhetoric of the Biz, its
absurdities, it self-gloryings. This is the world we live in - not the
world, but the words for the world. Everywhere, the framing properties of
language come up against their reflection in the mirror. Hello, nice to see
you again. Didn't know you were in town. Like Harpo Marx's Lacanian schtick.
Rumors of transparency. This Bud's for you.

"The eye always sways across mixing but
Accretion comes refusing content"
("Interlalia")

The sweet desultory impenetrable nexus of all our days of words, numbered.
So that to speak at all is truly to be vexed. Sound the high note anyhow,
then the low.

"By this untelling I have annexed
A space worried from speech."
("Glottophagia")

There's a singular elegance and intelligence and a truly delicious wit at
work here. VEXT is a perpetual delight from any point to the next.

(The preceding has been an announcement of itself. No animals were intended
during its production).

Granary Books announces the publication of Golem by Jack Spicer with
collages by Fran Herndon and an afterword by Kevin Killian.


<bold>

</bold>The manuscript of Spicer's Golem poems was discovered by Fran
Herndon and Kevin Killian in 1997 in a "...dog-eared manila folder. The
first poem in this series saw print-in the 'Spicer issue' of
Manroot-only because Lew Ellingham had copied it onto a brown paper bag
after Spicer posted in on the wall of Gino & Carlo's bar. That it had
any successors few guessed or knew." The seven images accompanying the
six poems are from Herndon's "Sports Collages," her "painterly
re-working of pop images cut from the pages of Sports Illustrated and
other mass-market magazines...." "Spicer and Herndon draw on [the]
complex legend [of the golem] to animate their conception of the
athlete-and poet-as hero and monster, corpse and avenger. For these
artists, the corruption of innocence under the nexus of capital is as
simple as, and as confounding as, a 'fix.'" (All quotes from the
afterword.)


Golem is designed and printed letterpress by Philip Gallo at the
Hermetic Press. The images are beautifully reproduced, digitally, in
full color. The edition consists of 150 copies signed by Fran Herndon
and bound at the Campbell Logan Bindery in paper over boards. 5 1/2" x
8 1/2", 20 pp. One hundred copies are for sale. $150.

Does anyone out there know of sublet/accomodation possibilities for the

Any information on other readings or events would be great too.

Thanks for all expositions and explanations re: transparency.

I have come to believe recently, and this discussion reinforces this
formulation for me, that all ideology, all, is merely Taste in Disguise.

Could someone in Poetics land help this enterprising scholar? You could
respond directly to him, though I'd like to know the info too, and perhaps
others would. Snowing hard here, Sylvester

[apologies for cross-postings!]

Moscow artist Avdei Ter-Oganian is about to go to prison for his
performance "Young Anti-Christ" which he made in last December at "Art
Manege" Fair in Moscow.
During the peformance he was proposing to the fair visitors to profane
mass-produced copies of Orthodox icons and was giving instructions how
to do it, i. e. crash with an axe (which was supplied), write obscene
words and put obscene drawings on them. Few icons were profaned in this
way. The action caused negative response from part of the audience which
grew in a scandal. His installation was taken off the wall and further
performing was prohibited by the Art Fair director. Moreover, the
curator of non-commercial part of the Fair has later lost her job.
Avdei’s action attracted a lot of responce in media. Most negative (and
very fast) one came from a right-wing oriented TV channel "Moscovia"
which devoted few (!!!) programs called "Russian House" to convicting of
Avdei and calling to requital. They were accusing him of being a Satan’s
envoy, offender of national sanctuaries, Orthodox religion, Russian
Nation, fathers’ faith and Russia itself. In these programs all
participants of the performance as well as artists and curators who
share Avdei’s ethical and aesthetical principles were named (virtuos
people should know their enemies!). In TV programs and newspaper
articles Russian Orthodox priests openly called for punishment for
Avdei.
After this massive media attack Moscow City Public Prosecution
Department has initiated a case ("Kindling of religeous hatred"). Now
Avdei is treatened by 2-4 years of prison.
Avdei says about his action:
"I am continuing ironical thread in art. My action was a parody on
modernism. Using banal gestures of agression towards public, culture,
etc. I am coming back to the roots of epatage. This was the main idea of
my work and as we can see it absolutely doesn’t fit our orthodox space.
Analyzing it from the social and political points of view one can talk
about protest against coming back ideology (this time - orthodox), one
can talk about unjustice: look - people are not getting salaries for
their jobs and at the same time enormous money is being spent on
reconstruction of aesthetically miserable Temple of Christ the Redemptor
(in Moscow). Orthodox icon was not an accidental choice, It was an
attempt to find the painful point of the society. Today, when Russian
intelligentsia is turning right without any reflection about that I
consider my action as very topical. Intelligentsia was bought by
clishes. It’s interesting to try to stop it and make thinking."
Advocats of Avdei have their points: his action must be evaluated  by
art critics and by the Church, but not by the state. He did offend
religeous feelings of people but the question is: should true christians
reply with forgiveness or should they apply to the Public Prosecution
Department?
Avdei can be convicted very soon. Besides his personal problem this
would bring real danger to the freedom of artistic expression in Russia
because it creates the case.

You can help now!
1.  By writing to Russian Embassy in your country and expressing your
attitude to this situation.
2.  By acting through media.
3.  By writing directly to Moscow City Prosecution Department
(Novokuznetskaya Ul. 23A Moscow 113184 Russia) and/or to Khamovniki
District Court (7th Rostovsky pereulok 21 Moscow 119121 Russia). Please
point "Avdei Ter-Oganian case".
4.  By sending emails to for_avdei@easylife.org - they will be forwarded
to the above-mentioned institutions.
5.  Spreading the word.

If you work for an institution please make your letter as offical as
possible.
If you would like to contact Avdei - his telephone in Moscow:
007-095-2617172 (speaks only Russian). You can also contact him via
email through me.

of a reading with honorarium. Last years' recipients were Laura
Moriarty and Aaron Shurin. The deadline for submission is
coming up soon---March 26. If you want guidelines, email me
(backchannel) with your snail mail address, and I will send you
the brochure. (A submission includes a ten page manuscript).

thanks,

Subject:      Conference Report: Post-War American Poetry/Liege
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Just now back in Sweden recovering from a continental tour that included
a few days at the Post-War American Poetry Conference at the University
of Liege in Belgium.  For me the Liege gathering ranks up there with
last summer's Anglo-American Poetic Relations Conference in London and
the Fall '96 Assembling Alternatives Conference in New Hampshire as one
of the best conferences for experimental poetry in the last few years.

Paul Hoover kicked things off in the plush and impressive Salle
Academique with his talk "Murder and Closure: On the Impression of
Reality in American Poetry," in which he asked "How might the
ceaselessly closing 'new sentence' and the experimental formalism of
language poetry relate to New Formalism and its demands for a return to
closed form?" -- a big question,m with a long answer that took us from
Oulipo to the present day via Marshall McLuhan and Walter Benjamin.
Luckily, the conference proceedings will be published next spring, so
everyone who wants to will have a chance to go over Paul's dense survey
in detail.

Other highlights included the stunningly well read Peter Middleton
speaking on the apparent narrowing of avant-garde possibilities between
the demise of Caterpillar and the rise of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E IN 1978.
(Peter began his talk by playing Steely Dan -- not only a good way to
remind us of how far off '73 has become, but also a good way to wake up
a groggy morning crowd).  Steve Evans made some good points afterward
about the way poets have reacted to being labeled with the 'L= word' --
nobody thinks it is quite right for them, but then again they see some
paralleles, and in the discourse about avant-garde poetry, one seems to
be either a language poet or not to count at all, so poets seem to
ultimately accept the label, albeit with reservations.  I'd like to hear
more from Steve on these issues someday.

Keith and Rosmarie Waldrop were there, giving a reading with Jennifer
Moxley and serving as the great eminences gris for the whole affair.
There was also a panel on Rosmarie's work with papers by Kornelia
Freitag and Ann Simon, and at least one magazine on display that carried
an essay on her work (Samizdat #1, edited by yours truly).

If you're wondering who to watch among young Belgian poet-critics (and
who isn't) I'd say Michel Delville is your man.  At 30, he's done a lot:
become junior professor at Liege, helped organize the conference and
give it its experimental emphasis, written experimental poetry in
English and French (we hope to have some of his work in a future issue
of Samizdat) and published a book on the American Prose Poem with
University Press of Florida (a damn good book, too, with a long section
on Rosmarie Waldrop, and a detailed tracing of the roots of the American
prose poem in European literature).  In fact, Delville is so smart and
talented and conscientious and cool and darkly good looking one is
driven into fits of envy.  But I digress.

There was a fun double-reading by Maxine Chernoff and Paul Hoover at a
jazz club where we all drenched ourselves in Belgian beer. Maxine read
dialogue-poems about a 'fictitious' husband of hers and the odd sounds
he makes while orgasming, while Paul looked distinctly uncomfortable --
makes one wonder about referentiality and the scene of reading in a
whole new way.

Joe Amato and Kassia Fleisher gave a simultaneous double-voiced reading
on the subject of collaboration, and, as Paul Hoover pointed out, it
posed some interesting questions about the politics of listening -- Joe
was on one side of the room, Kass on the other, and Paul felt that those
of us on Joe's side were encouraged to listen to him, in a sense to root
for him, just out of proximity.  Some women on our side of the room
objected, saying they felt solidarity with Kass, who was speaking in a
kind of feminist discourse -- I found myself feeling the urge to listen
to Joe precisely because he was a man and Kass was giving a strong
feminist line, then I felt guilty about that and made myself listen to
Kass.  Hmmm...

Afterwards, instead of giving a paper Joe "gave paper" --he handed out a
piece of text/image design and encouraged everyone to e-mail him about
it later.  So the discussion continues.

Other good things, drawn up from an embrassment of riches:  Nick Selby
of the U of Wales on Gary Snyder, Diederik Oostdijk of Nijmingen on
Poetry Magazine's decline, Franca Bellarsi of Brussels on Beat
Orientalism, Sharon Kennedy-Nolle of Paris on the politics of the Pound
Museum.

The Waldrops read with Jennifer Moxley, but I had to miss this in order
to catch a train to Copenhagen.  I'd love to hear about it, if anyone
else was lucky enough to be there.  I also missed a panel on Rosmarie's
work and a language poetry panel chaired by Antoinne Caze from the
Universite d'Orleans, who is quite brilliant and ought to be published
in the States.

An interesting reversal of the usual conference, in which innovative
work exists only on the margins.  I remember one conference participant,
who was giving a very good paper on James Merrill, expressing his
frustration -- "Is this the picture of American poetry we want to
paint?  Is formal work so marginal as to disappear" On the one hand, a
completely fair question.  On the other hand, I couldn't help feeling a
kind of "now the shoe is on the other foot" sentiment.

The book of proceedings will be published in the Spring of 2000 by the
University of Liege Press, and will be a bit hard to get in the US.  You
can send orders in advance to:

EPOS is a reflexive sphere within which collisions & entanglements of
all LONGPOEM thoughts/works are invited.  Dialogue.  Networking.
Collective creation of a long poem resources website. A medium for the
broadcast your long poem in progress.  Book trading. Bibliomania.
Manifestos. Filibusters. Interwriting. Observations of the Author inside
her lifelong writation. Or in the very least, a readerly lens for
practical & usable understanding of works such as A, The Martyrology,
Maximus Poems, Cantos, Howl & ....

"The serial poem is not simply a sequence.  It is meant to be a
narrative that transfigures time, our limit, mine.  I have wanted to use
the form because it makes language direct and insistent without
reference to a grid of meaning, which in our time has become
intolerable, a-historical, a lie.  Delicate and harsh are the words that
come to mind to describe the form.  Since form is always the reach of
content, rhythmical and musical, the serial structure has allowed me to
imagine the indeterminate nature of what we are beyond finitude and
other small dead ends."

Robin Blaser (from the Long Poem Anthology)



"What is a long poem? perhaps it is simply a long life or some trust in
the durational aspect of being alive."

And so two days after Kubrick, one day after Joe Di MAggio (btw, there
used to be an excellent poetry magazine called Joe Di Maggio in England
during the early seventies) here is news of someone else who called it
splitsville: the Argentinian writer Adolfo Bioy Casares, author of
_Asleep in the Sun, _The Adventures of a Photopgrapger in La Plata_,
_Diary of the War of a Pig_, _The Russian Doll and Other Stories_, and
many more. His best American translator, to my mind, is Suzanne Jill
Levine (though I must confess I read him mainly in French into which he
was translated early and excellently). He was 84 and had been awarded
the Cervantes prize -- the most prestiguous Spanish literary prize -- in
1990.

Basic info on him at the following url:

A rather funny 1994 interview can be read at:

Folks--

Despite my best intentions, I ended up having too much work last weekend to
justify the two hour drive each way to UCSD.  I'm sure I'll regret this for
the rest of my life (especially as I'm highly unlikely to see B. Mayer read
under other circumstances)--to hone this growing feeling of guilt and missed
opportunity, is anyone ready to post a report on the Pagemothers

Comments: To: humanist@kcl.ac.uk, H-CLC@msu.edu

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

9 March 1999

The editors of the William Blake Archive
<http://www.iath.virginia.edu/blake/> are pleased to announce the
publication of three new electronic editions of Blake's most popular work,
_Songs of Innocence and of Experience_. They are of copies C, F, and
L -- none has been reproduced before now.

_Songs_ copy C is one of the first copies of the combined _Songs_. Along
with copies B, D, and E, it was formed in 1794 of _Innocence_ plates
printed in raw sienna on both sides of the leaf in 1789 and _Experience_
plates lightly color printed in yellow ochre in the same format in 1794.
By this time, Blake had decided to move plates 34-36 ("The Little Girl
Lost" and "The Little Girl Found") to _Experience_, but since plate 34 was
printed on the verso of the leaf with plate 26 ("A Dream"), plate 26 is
read in this copy, as well as in copies B and D, as an _Experience_ poem.
And, like copies B and D, copy C is missing plate 52 ("To Tirzah") but has
the small vignette known as plate a (five cherubs carrying a naked
figure), one of Blake's earliest relief etchings used here as a tailpiece.
Copy C is in the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress.

Bibliographically, copy F is even more interesting. It, too, consists of
two sections printed differently and at different times. Its _Innocence_
plates were printed in green ink on both sides of the leaf in 1789,
probably before the raw sienna printing. Its _Experience_ plates were
heavily color printed on one side of the leaf in 1794, before those in
copy C, possibly while _Experience_ was still in progress. The impressions
of _Experience_ were printed with those now in _Songs_ copies G, H, and
T, which are all missing plates 39, 44, 45, and 48. Together, these four
plates form one sheet of copper. The fact that all four plates
are missing from all four copies suggests that the plates were
not yet part of _Experience_ at the time of this printing. These four
color-printed copies of _Experience_ appear to have been intended as
autonomous publications.  At any rate, there are no extant sets of
_Innocence_ impressions printed in this style, copies G and H remain
without _Innocence_, and copies F and T were assembled by someone other
than Blake.

_Songs_ copy L, like copy F, is in the Yale Center for British Art. Unlike
copies C and F, though, its two parts were printed together in a uniform
style, dark brown ink on one side of the leaf, ca. 1795. It has all 54
plates, including plate 52, that make up the combined _Songs_ and is
numbered by Blake 1-54.

All of these editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and all are
fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique
Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. We
now have twenty-nine copies of sixteen illuminated books in the Archive.
We will soon be adding two more copies of _The Marriage of Heaven and
Hell_ and an in-depth illustrated Tour highlighting the Archive's features
and some ways to use its resources. We will continue to add new electronic
editions of illuminated books throughout the spring and summer.

Actually, it's the "he" of the playlet that doesn't like the sound that
the "she" makes.  Interesting that the listener's interpretation of the
piece was the opposite (and certainly supportable, of course).

Here's her address from Gale Research/Contemporary Authors database:

 Addresses: Home: 47 Paultons Sq.,
                  London SW3, England.

Ms. Raine would be 91 in June (I do not know if she's still alive.) She
took an MA from Cambridge in 1929, in a cohort that included William
Empson, Ronald Bottrall, Humphrey Jennings, Charles Madge (whom she married
after divorcing Hugh Sykes Davies), Michael Redgrave, James Reeves, et al.
-- all poets before turning to other things (Jennings made documentaries,
Madge did Mass Observation, and we all know what Empson and Redgrave got
into.)  In researching Bronowski, Mr. Sandefur might want to see bios and
memoirs on these other figures as well as Ms. Raine.

All best wishes,

Jim

Thanks to Pierre for the sad news about Bioy Casares. It has been expected
for a while; he has long long been my favourite LatinAmerican writer. Once
my wqife refused to read past the midpoint of _A Plan of Escape_ because
she was afraid she would have to give up her mind for the sake of a book.
Exactly right, I thought. I try to read him in Spanish and then I read him
in English.Once a magazine in Ontario, knowing of my interest, tried to get
me to translate a new story tghat had appeared in a Buenos Aires newspaper,
and I tried, but wouldnt do it becauyse I was afraid of not being good
enough translator. Thank goodness there is a lot of work from him, and
several years ago _The Review_ that magazine that studies LatinAmerican
writing (is it in Washington?) did an issue on Bioy.

In looking for his books, be patient. A lot of bookstores will file him
under C, just as they file Garcia Marquez under M.

Dear Colleageus:

In today's (Tuesday's) NY Times, thers is a front page story on the
decision of William J. Ivey, chairman of the National Endowment of the
Arts, to cancel a grant to Cinco Puntos Press, a small (make that a tiny)
press in El Paso.

You can read the entire tale by checking the NY Times on the web, but the
short form is this: Cinco Puntos is publishing a beautiful little book
titled "The Story of Colors," which invites children to read a folk tale
about Mexican gods who take a gray world and turn it into color.

The author of this bilingual children's book is the Zapatista leader Marcos
who was originally a professor of graphic art.  Marcos appears in an inside
book flap in a photo showing him in a black ski mask hiding his face.  Mr.
Ivey canceled the grant aburptly (of course well after it was awarded by
the NEA) because he said he was worried about some of the grant money (a
grand total of $7,500, by the way) making its way into Zaptista hands.

This is patently absurd not only because of the sum involved, but because
all of these issues were carefully addressed by the grant selection
committee and oversight board for the NEA who were fully satisified that
the publication of this beautiful children's book was the only thing being
paid for--and to a reputable printer.

Aside from the terrible news this must be for a labor-of-love press (which
is done out of the publisher's home in El Paso), the precedent here is
alarming.  In effect, the chairman of the NEA has overturned all the due
process of the NEA grant-giving and governance structures.

I simply called El Paso Information and got the phone number of the press
(also his home), spoke to the wife of the publisher, and asked for their
address.  She seemed pleased.  My husband and I are sending a check to the
press in the hope it will be a small part of a bigger effort to cover
publishing costs. In case anyone is interested, here is the address of the
publisher of "The Story of Colors":

                Bobby Byrd
                Cinco Puntos Press
                2709 Louisville
                El Paso TX 79930

A letter to the NEA--good and furious--is also in order.

All best--Trish

George and others,

I think you might be referring to the Latin American Review, which comes
out of
New York City.  It is a publication that is published by the Americas Society
on Park Avenue.  I believe that it also has a connection with Columbia
University.

     CIRCULATE WIDELY

      Petition to protect small booksellers. This petition is important to
     the small independent booksellers.  Please take a moment to sign it.
     If you are the 50th, 100th, 150th
      signature, please e-mail the petition to the AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS
     ASSOCIATION, e-mail address ab-info@bookweb.org .

      PETITION TO BLOCK BARNES & NOBLE ACQUISITION OF INGRAM
      This petition will be sent to the US Congress, Department of  Justice
     and the Federal Trade Commission to block Barnes & Noble's  proposed
     acquisition of the Ingram Book Company, the single largest  supplier
     of books to small bookstores across the country. This  acquisition,
     should it be allowed to take place, is just one more  example of the
     large scale corporate consolidation that has  infiltrated every corner
     of our culture.

      As the desire intensifies to increase bottom line profits,  no matter
     what the other consequences, so does the concentration of  power in
     the book industry. Consumers are left with an environment in  which
     fewer and fewer people are deciding which books get published and
      ultimately, which books Americans can read and buy. Barnes & Noble
     has  already entered into an alliance with the $14 billion media
     giant,  German-owned Bertelsmann AG.   Now with Barnes & Noble's
     proposed acquisition of the billion-dollar  Ingram Book Company, there
      can be little doubt that the book industry  is falling prey to the
     same anticompetitive ills that currently plague  computer software and
     other industries.  This deal would make  independent bookstores
     virtually dependent upon their largest  competitor for their books.
     (It is as if Burger King and Wendy's  had to buy their French fries
     from  McDonald's).

      We need your help.  As a patron of independent booksellers, please
     sign the petition to help us lobby the government to stop this
     proposed merger.

      Please exercise your right as a citizen and tell the government how
      you feel. We sincerely thank you for your support.

      Please add your name to this petition and forward it to as many
     people as you can. If you want to sign the petition but not send it
     around, please sign and return it to e-mail address above.

"Well, folks--!" (O-H Manifesto 1, April 1972).  Available at the
Poetry Project's website if you clicked past its 2/27 posting to this
list are 28 folios ranging in size from 10 to 188 pages:  about 1350
pages printed out.  Hard copy thrown out to whoever would use them.  Who
needs them?  Who would read these pages among the winged voices on this
wire?
        RF's call for collaborative extensions, conversions--even abbreviated
patchings and improvisings--speaks to a need for group production,
banding, hybrid tongues, and the Theater (which RF declared dead in
1971, calling Brook's Midsummer Night the corpse that proved it,
encasing actors in the Old Man's text) rises like the lost Lusitania as
an alternative site to classroom and conference table, let alone all the
silken-skilled pages of poetry moving from every direction and jamming
no matter how many signs, text cites, sights, sexes, etc., serving time
there as objects of study.
        Culture props.  Agit prop.  The prop as prosthesis.  To whom?  In this
climate. Danger Poet Com.  The expression meshine fueled by these 1350
pages empties out Socrates-Shakespeare and gives whoever wants to use it
a spoken language, a double tongue.  Rosalind-Orlando III, ii, lls.
297-435.  "--Do you hear, forester?"  "To read off the 'said' from the
face of the thought?"  (O-H Manifesto 1).
        On this new mega-site where one or the other of the voices somewhere or
other either says that it is or says what is "the kingdom of the kiss,"
identities rise and evaporate like steam over the stove, roles change
and exchange and interchange, scotch taped signatures refuse to adhere
to their speakers, WORDS are WORLD along the parallel forceline Foreman
wrote about years ago--art scanning life and opening out into unexplored
possibilities of real time composition, a kind of workers'
photography--and philosophy at last begins to risk its expression (one
of the crucial concerns on the table at Blaser/Vancouver several years
ago) as it turns to a proposition that sounds almost (anti-oedipally)
anti-Antin.  O Father of the Spoken Word,
        do we grasp a word only in its passage between two mouths?

With the permission of my friend poet and novelist Paul Pines I forward to
the list a poem of hise about his longterm friend and neighbor Bill Bronk,
preceded by a note and followed by Bill's response to the poem.

Dear Mark,

I would like to share something with you. In January I came to visit Bill
and found him sleeping on the livingroom couch. I sat there with him asleep
for twenty minutes or so and on the way out wrote a poem on a napkin in the
kitchen. I emailed the poem to a mutual friend and to Wayne Atherton at The
Cafe Review. Wayne wrote me back he wanted to publish it, and the friend
responded by saying she thought the poem somehow less than palatable. I
knew it was "risky" but I believed the last lines pointedly "Bronkian." I
sent it on to Bill with my heart in my mouth and he, of course, understood
immediately what I had intended. ...His letter to me, with its generosity
of spirit and depth of vision also reveals his state of mind. His thoughts
about "completion" were I believe the dawning of his own completion.

ARTIFACTS
                for William Bronk

The house on Pearl Street is as it was
in gothic disarray
                        Loren's iron sculpture
                        (a lance stuck through a shield)
                        sits on the porch
bare ginkos
in the December afternoon
hover over the dormers like dowagers
over a tombstone
                           I enter
through the kitchen
a half-eaten apple on the table
beside your inhalers the compressor
a potentate by the telephone
bellowing orders to an empty sun porch
follow the hose into the front room
where you lie hooked at the nose
to the other end
                        under a threadbare
                        red comforter
stretched out on the couch
your head high-domed
beneath a fringe
of white hair
hugging yourself
restless blue-nailed fingers
at your chest work
to fill your lungs
with air
knit unspoken
words
        I sit on the window seat
        and wait
not for you
to wake
           but something
           else...
all the old artifacts
are here
           Canaday's darkly etched
           variations on
           the Chambered
           Nautilus
Marril's
Provincetown seascapes
Peter's ingenious
mobile
           sunbeams
           on the Persian rugs

winter light fills the room

           (as it always does
           as it never will
           again)

there is an end
to learning
                its acquisition
                and utility
and to
love

Dear Paul

        But of course--your piece is moving and beautiful. It goes beyond what was
said by as we say "the other Will"

                "This thou perceivest which makes thy love most strong
                To love that well which thou must leave ere long."

                How one always wishes for an end
                --to be complete.

        As you sense, I have reached the point where being complete engages and
entices me. Your concluding statement takes a risk that compels what your
intention is. I am so pleased that you sent me the piece and even more
strongly pleased that you wrote it.

                                        Hugs
                                        B.

Subject:      Page Mothers Report, part 1
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I'll try to report on the Page Mothers conference at UCSD last weekend
(March 5, 6, 7) but it will be from an oblique, Jamesian angle, since I
certainly wasn't central to the events being a male observer, a novelist,
hardly a poet at all and not much of a theorist.  I left San Francisco with
Dodie Bellamy and felt very much in her wake, and of course the natural
sunlight and freshness of La Jolla gave me that old jaded feeling like an
especially reptilian Norman Maine (not Bates).  At the San Diego airport
the feeling of dislocation began once I spotted Taylor Brady wandering
around and I said, "What are you doing here at the airport?" and it turned
out he had come to pick us up.  (Throughout the whole weekend this feeling
repeated itself, the rupture that comes of seeing one's friends from San
Francisco in a whole new light, a literal light, bright, serene, pale and
unclouded.)  We were staying at the Radisson La Jolla, a htoel at the foot
of the campus near the Medical Center so you could walk back and forth from
the conference to the hotel.  And at 3:30 or so we boarded a shuttle with
Mying Mi Kim and Standard Schaefer and wound up at the site, the huge
strange library that rises up from the ground in layers of solar panels and
black mirrors, to attend the cocktail (well, wine and cheese type) party
that opened the conference.  A few hours later Rae Armantrout gave a
welcoming speech that hit most of the notes of congratulation, celebration,
etc.  Though throughout the weekend there was this constant note of warning
that although women had "made it" in a certain way and their achievements
over the past 30 years are undeniable, it might all be taken away at any
moment by a new cultural upheaval.  This theme came back in different ways
many times, but none more clearly as when Armantrout told us the story of
Hypatia who was an ancient Greek writer and librarian and publisher who
founded a great library and then it was all destroyed and she herself torn
to pieces by Christians.

The opening panel was called "A Little History."  (All of the panels were
conceived in very broad terms so that part of the fun was that you couldn't
guess what X or Y would actually be talking about.)  Michael Davidson's
paper involved some transgender shenanigan frame in which we were invited
to think of him as a kind of woman, this made some audience members
restless if not actually confused, but basicall it described the conception
and writing and reception of Ntozake Shange's "For Colored Girls who Have
Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf."  Kathleen Fraser spoke after
him.  The celebratory note of the conference was continued here, as in many
other papers which were testimonial in nature, autobiographical accounts of
how-I-founded-this-that-and-the other-press.  Simone Fattal was not on hand
to read Etel Adnan's paper as both women found themselves unexpectedly
called to Paris or Beirut, but Harryette Mullen came through and discussed
a pair of books from the 70s that have not received much critical
attention--buried treasures--books written by African-American women from
an experimental and linguistically challenging stance, and Mullen focussed
most of her paper on one of them, Fran Ross' "Oreo" of which I had never
heard.  Expect to hear more about this later.  Finally, Patricia Dienstfrey
ended the panel with an account of the operations of Kelsey St. Press of
Berkeley and announced that Kelsey St. was roughly doubling up its
publication schedule and will now be printing 4 books a year instead of 2.
We heard so much about Fran Ross and Ntozake Shange that, walking after
dark through the campus back towards the hotel, many were heard to wonder
why they were not the guests of honor.  We began to think of these writers
in a different way and indeed, in the case of Ross, for the first time
ever.  (Mullen says she is at a preliminary stage of her quest for Ross,
she doesn't even know if she's alive or ever wrote anything else beyond the
distinguished "Oreo.")

So, some people went to a restaurant Il Torino nearby but I had such a bad
head ache I went back to the hotel and passed out and woke up around
midnight and made Dodie watch "First Blood" (Rambo, Part I) with me, a
great movie.  Thus I was totally up for the next day's panels which began
at 8:30.  At 7:30 Maureen Owen and I found ourselves alone on the shuttle
to the library so I introduced myself and then we went to the side entrance
door of the library and pulled on it as instructed.  What chaos since
apparently it had been left unlocked all night long and the alarms sounded
and a series of very Brechtian, David Bowie Station-to-Station strobe
lights came on!!  That woke me up but good.  Luckily we were not arrested,
though it was eerie being in the deserted library.  I forgot to mention
that all these panels were held at the "Geisel Room" named after the great
benefactor to UCSD Theodor Geisel (Dr Suess) and the library was
celebrating him by mounting a show of many of his original drawings and
paintings, so it was Dr. Seuss everywhere.  Panelists spoke in front of a
large reproduction of the famous Cat in the Hat (teal, red, white stripes)
who never looked more bizarre If you ask me.  At 8:30 a respectable crowd
arrived for the "Poetics" panel.  Myung Mi Kim opened the event with a
poetically written talk about fragmentation, mispoken or misheard
syllables, the partiality of writing.  Carla Harryman was energetic with a
tremendously thought out account of poetics which I can't describe well or
paraphrase, we will have to wait for the printed version of these papers to
decide what exactly was being enacted.  Brenda Hillman and Martha Ronk gave
accounts of their own poetics, illustrated with their own poems, both were
engaging and actually wonderful speakers,. but I could see the clock
ticking away; already the panels were on overtime by the time Lyn Hejinian
got up to speak.  With her own eye on the clock she read rapidly from a
series of notes (again, it will be great to read the whole paper) on
different Greek concepts of writing pleasure.  The third panel was about
the canon, and this panel resembled a regular panel most of all due to the
presence on it of actual literary critics and historians.  Mary Margaret
Sloan's paper on the "poem of dominion" was based on an essay she had
written ten years before for "How/Ever," which she passed around.  She
discussed its fragmentary nature, an enactment of the poetics she wrote of,
but said that part of its elliptical quality was based on fear, her own
fear of being understood, and recounted to the amusement and horror of all
several incidents from her own career in which various unnamed male poets
treated her horribly.  I recognized a few of these incidents myself.  These
unnamed men who said terrible things were wraiths at the conference, their
voices acerbic, crackling and mean like the Grinch who Stole Christmas.
One man told Sloan, who had embarked on her "Moving Borders" project,
"You're not smart enough to compile an anthology.  You don't even know who
Bjork is.  You're too old, why don't you just die now?"  So there was this
moving image of being told to die that was quite affecting.  There was also
the sense that Sloan had raised the stakes by attesting to actual abuse or
at any rate, a great opposition like Sauron waiting just outside the
conference room doors.

Oh my, I can see I've been writing this, and not very well, for an hour and
I have to leave to go to my office so I will continue tomorrow.  There's
more drama, rupture, ecstasy to come.  But I did want to say right away
that the spirit of celebration and optimism was made concrete by the way
many people had brought or announced their new books and magazines just in
time for this Conference, so it was like Christmas in a way for we got to
see many new books, etc., gathered on these long tables in one corner of
the Geisel Room and we all flocked around them to see what was new.  In
this spirit Dodie and I made a special issue of our zine, "Mirage
#4/Period[ical]"--we had asked many Bay Area women poets/publishers/editors
to give us one page of their current or representative creative work--even
the ones who were not attending the Conference--and we gave copies of the
assembled issue out free at the conference.  To about eighty people.  There
are still some left, so if you contributed to this issue don't worry you'll
get yours soon, and if any of you reading this wants a copy just write me
please, back channel, and give your address, I'll send it to you.

Dear Colleagues--

Today's Times (March 11 Wed) reports that the Lannan Foundation has stepped
forward to the tune of $15,000 to make up for the grant the NEA cancelled
for the Cinco Puntos Press.  I was hoping something like this might happen.

The issue is still there in terms of procedural concerns for the NEA, of
course.  And I do think that letters or e-mails to the NEA protesting this
action might actually be seen by the agency and its leadership as a help:
it tells them that they have supporters out here and that they don't need
to knuckle under before their knuckles are even rapped....by Jesse Helms or
whatever watchdog is watching them.  The agency gets treated as if it were
always on the verge of commiting a felony and I imagine this makes the
leadership extremely nervous and given to damage control before there's any
damage....

the poem above was derived from the opening of the 1st volume of Thoreau's
Journal - the first line is inevitably the heading of an entry or one word
from the heading - the selections of words is due to vowel occurrence - in
the 'sunrise' stanza i used every word with either an 'i' or an 'o' - in
others 'creeds' for instance i selected only words with an 'e' - words per
line matches that of the original - 12 was the intended stopping point & the
order is (as best as i can gauge) the same as the composition

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi all,

Thanks very much to Kevin Killian and Kathy Lou Schultz for tantalizing news
of the Page Mothers conference last weekend. I hope to hear more from you
other lucky attendants.

Something Kevin mentioned really interested me and I'd like to hear more on
this subject: the fear of women losing whatever ground we've gained. (Should
I put quotes around "we've"?)

I just got home from a reading at Black Oak Books in Berkeley for Rachel
Blau DuPlessis's anthology THE FEMINIST MEMOIR PROJECT.  It was neat to see
her live.
Roxanne Dunbar, one of the speakers, was REALLY COOL, with a fabulous bob
and lovely barettes and very funny and astute and daring.  Her book, RED
DIRT, is a grand narrative of Oklahoma and Okie - dom. My mom & I both loved
it. But my point was:

Discussions turned to Time magazine's portrayal of the "backlash" (occuring
every five or so years acc. to someone) and Ally McBeal replacing Gloria
Steinem replacing Susan B. Anthony, etc (Ally McBeal was the only color
photo too, if I recall).  Its vaguely funny to me that a fictional character
is the basis of Time's analysis, but also rather frightening.  Also
frightening tho is having 3 women with perfectly comfy jobs in academia seem
to question (interrogate) us "youths" about what we're doing to pitch in for
women.  I don't mean to be rude or disrespect the work these women have done
AT ALL -- the growth of all this knowledge: its meant I could find a way to
be intellectual, to be a writer that felt like ME.  No small thing of
course.  But as I sat there with my dear friend Grace I really felt we were
both being stared at for an answer.  Only one other woman there looked about
our age. (31 FYI). She passed on the blame (?), mentioning that she taught
high school and it was hard to get the teenagers to know there was still
work to do.

First of all, saying that "youth" don't GET IT seems silly and
trouble-making (is your daughter the only exception or do you only believe
what you read in Time?) , second: hello, (like ohmigod) Grace is writing a
thesis on women's novels of the '70s, US and UK women, some of which are
books she found in their first paperback form in her mom's garage and read
as a jr high school student. What could be a more beautiful legacy? Was it
easy to find advisors who thought this was a reasonable enterprise? Not as
easy as Joyce studies, I'll bet you the sum total of my student loan debt.
I do some stuff for the ladies, too.  I wasn't at the page mothers, I don't
know what that tone was.  I wasn't entirely put off by the tone here in
Berkeley tonight either. (Tho as a daughter I can say the predictability of
this town can really get a girl down - of 4 men in the audience, 2 spoke.
Women had to talk about childbirth and how we should really not go back to
metal straps -- OK -- look, I'll vote for that.) But my point is:
The women presenting were making a big deal about how, back in the day, the
fact that the media framed them all as "bra burners" or something made each
of them feel alienated, like HEY, I'm me, I'm not the media projection.
Well, ma'ams, if I might, I'm not Ally McBeal either.

And I'd stick up for Hypatia too.

Would love further discussions of such.

Subject:      Page Mothers Report, part 2
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  I'm continuing with more of my on-scene
action report from last weekend's "Page Mothers" conference at UCSD (USA)
on March 5, 6, 7.  I broke off right in the middle of the "canon" panel
just as Maureen Owen was about to launch into her personal history of
"Telephone" magazine and "Telephone" books.  Christanne Miller and Lynn
Keller next appeared together and divided their presentation into two
halves, the first recounted rapidly the history of women editing projects
in the era of, um, say 1915-1930, Margaret Anderson, Jane Heap, Lola Ridge,
Kay Boyle, Sylvia Beach, Harriet Monroe etc etc, a dozen more, and showed
how these women ushered on modernism in a large scale and how this tendency
gradually faded away during the Depression and the women themselves effaced
as modernism became thought of as a totally male movement, their
contributions forgotten or nearly so.  Lynn Keller then performed the
contrast of the 1990s and all were struck by the unusual similarities and
differences between the two eras.  It made your hair stand on end.  The
next panelist was Libbie Rifkin of the University of Alabama who gave, I
thought, a great paper outlining, very subtly and seriously, the editing
styles of Anne Waldman and Bernadette Mayer during the hey day of the 2nd
NY School and how in the "World" Anne Waldman created this miniature
universe of poets, all of whom could "fit in her bedroom," treating them
all as creatures of rare fame and value, whereas Mayer, in 0 to 9 and
Unnatural Acts, continually played with collaborative values of non-agency,
anonymity, textuality, etc.  I'm not doing this paper much justice but it
was exhilarating to listen to.  Then the morning was over and we went to
lunch in the nearby Student Union and I took more photos.

God, did I take a lot of photos.  The fourth panel was called "Mrs. Poetry"
and was devoted to the work of Bernadette Mayer.  It must have made some of
the panelists nervous to have Mayer sitting right there in front of them
grinning like a Cheshire cat.  What if she took into her head to interrupt
any of them while they spoke.  I wouldn't have done this panel for 100
dollars, but I'm glad they took the Mayer challenge.  Brad Westbrook
introduced this panel pointing out that the Mandeville Collection which is
directly behind the Geisel Room where we sat owns the Bernadette Mayer
papers (1958-1995), and then Stephen Cope who had catalogued the papers for
the Archive came up to the podium and gave his talk, announced as a kind of
love song and indeed it was and then Lee Ann Brown's paper was similar, an
alphabetical list of words and topics and titles on which she expanded from
long memory, memoir, anecdote, and quotation.  Most of us in the audience
loved it. Leslie Scalapino followed with a disquisition on/against
"lineage" which made some abrupt, mind boggling jumps among the work of
Mayer, Rodrigo Toscano and Bob Grenier, warning us against the cult of
personality in poetry and how the worship of the "Revered figure" could
cloud our minds against the thought of the poem.  This was hard to follow
in parts but salutary, I suppose.  Juliana Spahr had the difficult task of
presenting a more conventional paper on Mayer's "Sonnets" but I thought it
the most satisfying of the four talks and has made me re-read the Sonnets
in a new way after hearing her and nodding and doors opening in my mind
like Ingrid Bergman's dream in "Spellbound."  Well done everybody.

The final paper was on the Future.  Laura Moriarty's talk was on the
possibilities of the internet, web, etc., but focussed on the tendencies of
"avant-garde" poetry of merge together so that people are writing more and
more like each other (provocative) and then rather chillingly said that the
future is out of our hands since the machines themselves, smart as they
are, were planning, or perhaps not planning, even now to blend their
technological knowledge with our human knowledge.  I took this to mean that
although we don't know it Bill Gates etc has already determined our future
but afterwards she said, no, it was the machines themselves (shades of Dean
Koontz' "Demon Seed" with my favorite Julie Christie.)  Pamela Lu spoke on
behalf of the Berkeley based Idiom collective.  Faced with the incredible
cheapness of web publishing the Idiom boys and girls were paradoxically
tempted to spend incredible amounts of $$$$ on precious object/books, as
one tendency prompted its exact opposite, an irreconciliable split in
desires and needs.  Renee Gladman's paper was an incendiary one in which
she challenged the makers of anthologies to increase the percentage of
writers of color in them.  No longer would she put up with an anthology of
25 writers of whom 3 or 4 were people of color.  (Was this the Talisman
"New American Poets" anthology?  The "Moving Borders" anthology?  The
conference itself?  Well we all got the picture.)  Dodie Bellamy spoke--oh,
just brilliantly, of course!  But she was overshadowed by the next speaker,
Marjorie Perloff, who gave the talk that had many people livid afterward.
(Though I missed part of it being so moved by Dodie's speech I had to have
a cigarette outside the house of Seuss.)  The hot points here were three,
that much current work hailed as "innovative" is not--and she had this look
in her eye as though she were hinting heavily that this was true of many of
the writers in the room.  The second point was that the so-called theory or
criticism written by poets is horrible.  She gave some examples, here
naming names, such as Ann Lauterbach.  The third hot point was her blanket
pronouncement that "L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E" magazine had been a male-dominated
oligarchy and that women had stayed out of the debate.  Had stayed out of
the "originary moment."  As soon as it was over Carla Harryman stood up and
said that although she had much respect for Perloff's accomplishments she
(Perloff) had now damaged herself irretrievably in her (Harryman's) eyes by
erasing the theoretical work done by women in the early years of the
"Language" movement.  One thing led to another and soon all were shouting,
stabbing the air with hands, asking questions, firing off charges of
"revisionism" on all sides, totally animated free for all.  That the panels
proper should end on this terribly heated note was exactly fitting, but it
had an undertone of despair to it also, as though elements of doubt,
overdetermination, fear had crept into the Geisel Room almost in a Trojan
Horse way.  Fate decreed it so, it was like the end of "Nightwood."  Please
understand that my misconstrual of these debates is not a purposive one, I
didn't feel, even as it was happening, that I knew what was being enacted
before my eyes.  Others will have different takes on these events and all
of them will be more accurate than mine.  But I tried as best I could to
grok it.  Then it was time for dinner and we trooped off to the Faculty
Club which was about a quarter of a mile away, probably less by daylight.
And after dinner there was a grand old-fashioned kind of reading by Maureen
Owen and Bernadette Mayer.  Well, I will have more to say later as I
continue my account of the Conference, but I have to leave now to go to my
office.

I've had quite a few requests to send out copies of the special "Page
Mothers" issue of "Mirage #4/Period[ical]" .  .. don't worry folks they
will all get in the mail to you.  A few wrote in to ask, well, what Bay
Area writers are included?  So here's the list: Dodie Bellamy, Mary Burger,
Cydney Chadwick, Norma Cole, Beverly Dahlen, Patricia Dienstfrey, Kathleen
Fraser, Susan Gevirtz, Lauren Gudath, Lyn Hejinian, Brenda Hillman, Myung
Mi Kim, Pamela Lu, Laura Moriarty, Yedda Morrison, Rena Rosenwasser,
Jocelyn Saidenberg, Leslie Scalapino, Kathy Lou Schultz, Mary Margaret
Sloan, and Elizabeth Treadwell.  If you write to me back channel please
give your full address and then, all will be sent to you in due course.

I missed the opening night panel but was there for the rest of the events.
I didn't hear this tone at all.
I did, by the way, hear the entire Perloff lecture. Everyone I've spoken to
about it seems to have heard a different talk than I did--my guess is that
we all, myself included, heard what we were prepared to hear. It will be
interesting to see it on the page to find out in what way my memory was
faulty. As I heard it Marjorie was trying very hard to narrow her
discussion to what she considers the closest thing to an agreed-upon
defining theoretical position for language poetry, the divorce between sign
and signified, and to what followed therefrom in the theoretical writing of
language school poets. The discussion of women's work per se seemed to me
to be thrown in for the occasion--it was almost beside the point. At a
different conference, I thought, she probably would have cited male
critical theory that she considers inadequate. But it was also clear to me
that she was enjoying being provocative, and I experienced her talk within
the drama of the conference as a sort of satyr play--scurrilous and comic.
It was an exciting end to an exciting conference.

THE FULL JENNIFER


1 Jennifer with Dialog so Real you can Taste it


Jennifer tossed her head to one side, smiling at Alan. She was wearing a
sheer blouse, and her long dark lustrous hair swayed in the breeze. You
could almost see a pearl gleaming between her perfect teeth. Her beige
skirt was short, her black stockings visible above her boots, and a thin
line of creamy flesh just above them, flushed with blood in his direction.

Jennifer's fingernails were painted red, and that smile, accompanied by
long fingers holding a shot glass, brought him no end of delight. That
light purple rouge of hers on her high cheekbones! The blue-black high-
lights in her hair! Her full lips were slightly parted in his direction,
as she said in that rich southern voice of hers, "Hello, Alan."

Her left hand, holding the black patent vinyl level purse with chrome
clasp, placed the said object on the transparent glass coffee-table, as if
it were the most precious purse in the world. Jennifer so delightfully
held her tortoise-shell cigarette holder in his direction, a cigarette
inserted and begging for a light as she said, "Do you have a match?" and
Alan, trembling, complied. She blew smoke in his direction, while he won-
dered how they were going to complete the perl program. "I'll close the
window," said Jennifer, and she walked slowly across the thick white shag
carpet to the open window twenty stories up. With a deft movement of her
right wrist, she wound the window shut and the room began to grow warmer
as the motion of the air began to slow except for the slight stirrings of
breath in the room.

"Now, as you were saying," Jennifer continued, her ravishing onyx brace-
lets dangling from her wonderful wrists. She cocked her pretty ears with
matching earrings, to each other, and to the bracelet, in his direction,
as if she were hanging on his every word. Walking over to the sumptuous
couch, Jennifer's smile grew with every instant step. The beautiful glass
chandelier had many tiny bulbs, throwing multiple shadows of Jennifer's
long neck on the cream-colored plaster ceiling. Her perfect breasts were
encased in her blouse with a brassiere so her nipples didn't show while
her hips swayed as she sat down next to Alan, waiting to begin.

She carefully unraveled the scroll with the perl program that was many
sheets long, but rolled up in an interesting way and tied with yellow and
blue ribbons, to which she said that she liked craft with her technology.
"Oh Alan," said Jennifer, "this is so beautiful, what the program does and
all the lines and the way it's written." She smiled and her rich pouting
lips opened in his direction. Her nails carefully held the blue and yellow
ribbons apart while she moved pages from the more rolled end of the scroll
to the lesser end. The beautiful ebony wooden handles looked wonderful in
her perfectly formed fingers, her cuticles visible through the beautiful
polish upon them, reflecting the myriad lights of the chandelier. The
myriad lights looked red as they were reflected from her sumptuous red
nail polish perfectly applied to her beautiful nails.

She carefully placed the cigarette in the ashtray with the burning end
down and touching the colorful ceramic floor representing eagles above
trees, of the expensive object, with the holder dangling over the trans-
parent glass of the coffee-table, at the other end. She turned slightly,
her pouting lips drinking from the expensive crystal shot glass holding
her whiskey as she continued to study the program. "Well Alan," she shot
back to him, "what do you think of this beautiful program which I like a
great deal?" Her soulful eyes like full moons with plaintive cries were
opened in his direction, looking as wonderful as the blue-black highlights
in her dark black long hair. She was looking so intelligent and curious
about this perl program that was in the scroll that was no at least partly
unrolled.

Jennifer placed her head back on the edge of the sumptuous couch with her
lips slightly parted like red and open lips in his direction. "Well, Alan,
let us relax," she said as she slithered in her amazing beige skirt across
the floor to the bookcase to pull down with her long slender fingers the
programming perl book that she had used for the help she had needed before
she had rolled up the scroll with the program upon it, that she was show-
ing him. She was so clear that she was proud of her programming tricks,
her bracelet flashing in the light of myriad chandelier bulbs in his di-
rection. Jennifer looked forward to a wonderful evening, and she said, in
an amazingly soft and lustrous voice, "Thank you for lighting my cigarette
and looking after my drink." Her beautiful legs were visible on the sofa
with black stockings and books pointed in his direction.

3 Sparkling Real-Life Description


Jennifer feels that Alan doesn't understand programming as much as she'd
like him to. She listens to him explain the nature of subroutines and
modules, worrying that she probably knows more about the issue herself.
She wonders if he can see how drugged she is, working through these dif-
ficult problems.

Jennifer is depressed watching Alan clumsily trying one kludge or another
to fix the program. She listens to him asking her to lay off the whiskey
as she heads back to the bar. She bends her ear towards him, trying to
make sense of his ignorance when it comes to anything computer. She's up-
set at his fudging his explanations over and over again.

Jennifer senses that Alan likes her when he talks about how beautiful she
looks, but she senses that he disapproves of her habits. She watches him
pace the floor himself now, as he tries one or another thing with the pro-
gram. She's nervous watching him head to the cd player, taking off Ameri-
can Woman the long version, and putting on some music he recorded himself.

Jennifer cries inside, sensing his pain at his lack of musical success,
now transformed into poor programming as well. She watches him take up the
scroll, attempt to figure out the complex listings, then returning it to
the table with the transparent glass top. She unbuttons a third button of
her blouse, hoping Alan will notice when he looks up and again mentions
her drinking.

Jennifer senses keen disappointment as half-naked and drugged she moves
closer to Alan, listening to him say that she should really really take it
easy with all that whiskey. She feels intense rapture as fingers press
against her naked breasts, and she is lifted bodily into the air. She
senses the world turning upside-down as she is placed upon the sumptuous
couch.

Jennifer feels warmth all over as she snuggles under a lovely cream-white
fuzzy blanket. She falls asleep with the sounds of her favorite music,
American Woman the long version, playing in the background. She dreams
that Alan is a brilliant programmer and a very successful musician. She
dreams that he is madly in love with her. She pauses in her sleep. She
begins to wake. She begs for his cock. She feels his cock deep within her,
plunging her into worlds without ends, without words or dreams.


4 powerhouse description sets you right in the action


o drugged jennifer so beautiful in your beige skirt and white blouse
o drugged bedraggled jennifer wonderful in your black stockings
o drawn and desolate jennifer in your sumptuous black boots
o jennifer swallowing the air that was alan
o jennifer finishing the perfect perl program
o jennifer winding the ribboned scroll, entering lines of code
o jennifer going to file then run then run

"o beautiful drugged jennifer, i want to be your vicodin!
i want to be your whiskey, i want to be your cigarette!"

with fury she swung at the quivering face barely visible.
out of the corner of her eye, the scroll rose in the air, white letters
flamed against black sky.
the scroll swung into an empty space where alan was, crashing towards
the white shag floor.
her teeth fastened on the space where his penis had vacated the warmth
of jennifer's body.
her arms tethered the knife slicing away at alan's wasted breasts.
deep within her, a crash was heard and the white floor suffered an
indentation.
the letters howled from the scroll as the learning perl book flew from
the shelf, crashing red and bloody on the floor.
american woman the long live version played to the short dead thing
embedded in the white shag rug, already past three a.m.
jennifer walked out of jennifer.
jennifer walked out of there, where jennifer walked out.

"o beautiful drugged jennifer, i want to be your vicodin!
i want to be your whiskey, i want to be your cigarette!"

At any given point, maybe about 1% of 1% of what is being produced is
good enough to stand the test of time, and to be acknowledged
subsequently as representing a genuine development of what had gone
before. Both history and statistical probability are stacked against you
in any quest to satisfy both a craving for novelty and a search for
significance amongst the contemporary output.

Because I am here at ground-zero, exactly seven days after the Page
Mothers Conference wound down with one of the best group readings I have
ever been party to witness, and it seems--once again--that the discourse
surrounding this conference will forever be held to whispers and will
not become part of the historical record, save for a useful notation of
its proceedings by one Kevin Killian, and because some of my thinking
was aided and advanced by the proceedings and the conversations
surrounding them, I feel that it is time for me to emerge from my
recuperative lurking to address the conference and a few other things
that have been stewing inside me since we last snuggled up against the
cold winds of December's scandal. I was tempted to hold my tongue on
this, for it isn't really my place to comment--as a white male,
etc.etc.--("whale" for short). On the other hand, I can't sit by in good
conscience and watch this space devolve once again to a daily dose of
chit-chat, which serve only to amuse the few people who bother to
participate. The relative silence in this space--at the hands of those
who otherwise know good and well that they should speak up--breaks what
little of a heart I have left. Even the quiz presented in this forum by
my new friend and true Page Daughter patriot, Kathy Lou Schultz, seemed
only to add to the air of mystery and the strange shroud of silence
surrounding the events. So, all this is to say, watch out, for what
follows here is a multiply-long post, only some of which is addressed to
the conference, which as I said helped me begin to solve problems which
I see in the current landscape of language arts and the "community"
which its relatively small-scale industry evokes and encourages.

Welcome Back - NOTICE to LURKERS

One of the last things I was working on for posting to Poetics before I
bailed unto lurkdom was an essay on my "progress" as an editor. A kind
of autobiography in editorial discretion. And it was partly in response
to the prodding of Dale Smith and others who challenged my notion that
some of the best writing being done today is being done by women,
especially women who live in the San Francisco Bay Area. I had no real
theories at that time about why this was. Indeed, I don't think that
gender is any kind of a determining factor. I never said that I thought
that women wrote better than men, but that the poetry that I liked was
more often to be written by women--and often it is the case that I only
found out afterwards, as it is often my practice to read books and
magazines from back to front. There is, as we all know, lots of poetry
by women which is terrible--as terrible as anything being written by
men. One of the reasons that I think that this is so difficult for some
people to take is that men are so much more present. It has been pointed
out many times that men are more likely to send out their work to be
reviewed by editors such as myself. When I posted to this space a
call-for-work addressed to WOMEN ONLY, the majority of inquries I
received were still by men, something which confused me a great deal. Do
most men feel themselves to be exempt from the criticism of their
sisters?? Even my gesture there, as a male editor, seemed odd and the
irony of all that wasn't lost on me. The reasons that women don't
contribute to this space, or don't submit their work to new magazines
and presses may be found in the attitude of the men who inhabit these
spaces. Look at the bizarrely phobic attitudes exhibited by some men on
this list at the very suggestion that I have raised here. They can be
characterized often by a spirit of ill-will, as if being the cultural
dominant were somehow a tradition, not unlike the racist attitudes
expressed by the right wing establishment in California. It saddens me
that a number of women who were at the conference haven't, in fact, felt
the need to transform this space into one in which their interests were
the status quo, for no "public" forum is as ripe as a takeover, even a
temporary intervention, as this one is. And while several women at the
conference indicated to me that they felt that the list wasn't a place
where they felt comfortable, I can only hope that this is no longer the
case, that under Chris Alexander's leadership, that this space will
CONTINUE to transform into something that we can all live with, or even
dare I say it, feel excited to participate in. And frankly, being that
this space in no way represnts any kind of democratic vista, an
ideological take-over, some kind of feminist intervention would be a
welcome rebuke to the potentially unfortunate return to "business as
usual" that has marked the list in recent weeks.

I have learned, however, there are reasons that women may find
themselves disinterested, finally, in our modest project. And while I
received lots of back-channel congratulations regarding my efforts to
"take a stand" back in November and December, something that someone
said to me off-list has stuck with me. This person, who found herself
also particularly embattled at a certain moment, asked the question-- at
such a time of struggle in a public forum--"where are one's friends?" --
and many of my supposedly closest friends, some of whom are former and
forthcoming "meow press authors" abandoned ship like so many Titanic 1st
class-passengers, leaving us "poetry workers" to attempt to save the
vessel by bailing water from the sinking ship. I am not complaining or
crying out at this point, having achieved enough of a distance from the
spectacle's last days to have made a number of realizations about the
nature of this "community" and the group of which it is a fractionate
representative. I will save those speculations for another time, as I am
sure that this debate will rise again. Perhaps it is a lesson that all
of you have already learned.

Chris Alexander does derserve praise, though, for undertaking this
thankless task, and (I might add) also some help. And by that I mean
that as the list returns to a status-quo (minus the bilous discharge of
people who have no interest in this communitarian project) where he
really needs your help is in the development of this space into an
articulate energy built up over pre-considered postings--more a
"magazine" than a "chat-room."  I've said this before, and I know I'm
not the only one with interests in this direction. The useful thing
about the new format is that the moderator can have influence over the
direction of the list. That itself becomes usefully ideological. There
is no need to have every one-liner forwarded to the list. Likewise there
is no need to put undo peer-pressure on Chris to forward such obviously
back-channel chitchat to the list. I can imagine that he feels it would
cause undo strain on his very diplomatic personality to try to appease
every last hastily-strewn commentary. We've gone that route. It's time
for a new attitude. This is not anything other than a call for all
LURKERS to rise up and take a stand.

Page Brothers in Drag:
Wannabe Women
or
Can I borrow your identity to advance my career?

The conference here last weekend was too multiple to address in any
complete manner. I hope that other views on this will be presented, here
as well as elsewhere, as the more dialog about "what happened" I hope
will go a long way towards developing an adequate picture of the events.
Before I go into my very subjective perceptions of one aspect of the
conference, let me try to address some of the larger pictures that come
through for me.

It was great to see such a grouping of power brokers (mothers) and their
attendant daughters, with a few of us boys scattered in for effect. The
conference itself was caught in the poetry festival and academic
conference dilemma, and like many of these mixed-project conferences,
this was a useful bringing together. Perhaps it is a legacy of the
theoretically-minded "language" school, which could be said to be one of
the major literary preoccupations of many of the women at the conference
(mother and daughters), that so many of the attendees (both presenters
and audience members) would be so astute to the issues involved. So
while it was academic on the one hand, many of the people present were
not "academics" per se, something which made the conference so much more
interesting than the typical academic conference, which usually has the
air of a good natured sporting event, with everyone shaking hands and
going home afterward. The fact that Marjorie Perloff's comments so
angered Carla Harryman and others is testament to the fact that with
this group the line between what constitutes theory and poetry has been
nearly erased in some corners of the poetry world, and indeed, in some
corners of the academic mainstream. And this is an issue that is worth
developing further, but I will save it for another time.

What did anger Carla, I think, brings me closer to my "thesis" about the
conference, or what it meant for me. The notion that the women language
poets were somehow practioners of a theoretical orientation defined and
packaged by the men of that generation (Silliman, Watten, Bernstein,
etc.) is perhaps not the main issue as far as I can see it. Marjorie did
try to stake out too much in her brief talk, which was excerpted from a
longer talk to be presented at the Barnard Conference next month. And
perhaps there rests some of the problem. I don't think she got to make
all of the connections she put underway, and while her argument may have
depended upon the suppositions raised by the recounting of the early
days of "language" history (told as male dominated in terms of theory
production goes), her argument and presentation suffered because she was
unable to tie it all up at the end (at least how I imagined how it might
end). While she did admonish those present to more rigorously define
what is meant by "innovative" and not use that word to define what I
perceive to be largely social groupings of newer (emergent) poets, that
proposal was made in the face of an angry group in the audience, led by
Carla Harryman, who took issue with her historical portrayal of the
women as not being theorists and the males being out front, etc.
Unfortunately, Perloff's call for a more rigorous theorizing of the
issues by women, especially younger women, was made before Jen Hofer and
Summi Kaipa gave a brilliant reading / study / performace during the
reading on Sunday, when Perloff was absent. Perhaps there is some deeper
history to what could be seen as "academic vs. poet" arguing, as I saw
an enraged member of the Harryman clan go chin-to-chin with Perloff a
few years ago in the cash bar at the Orono Conference on the 1950s. As
one astute ringside watcher remarked then, "at least Perloff shows up
for the fight."  And despite the contentious response her remarks
elicited, there is perhaps another way of looking at all this which
brings me closer, yet still (hang on, please), to the core of my
argument.

It was inappropriate for Perloff to spend so long on a particularly male
history at a conference devoted to the Page Mothers and especially since
she was on the "future" panel, the conversation supposedly arranged to
elicit views on where "we" might go next-- and the next wave,
exemplified by Renee Gladman's and Pamela Liu's presentations, the
highlight of the conference for me.

It was inappropriate, in my feeling, though I don't think it needed to
be. Regardless whether you think Perloff's history was right or wrong
(and I think we could debate this, though I would like to see a copy of
the *whole* paper, since as I have said, I felt it was the subject
matter alone which was inappropriate). Perloff's admonition to do
theorizing more rigorously, to propose a project beyond the gratuitous
fluff and name-dropping reviews so common in today's poetical discourse
(a trend not limited by gender) was something I very much applaud.
Someone here on this list asked recently what might be considered "new"
and I think if one could take on that question, they might be setting
themselves up for more criticism, as even the search for a "new thing"
based on some kind of formal principle might be seen as another
masculinist gesture, an attempt to prescriptively orientate our literary
bearings based upon modes and criteria developed through Poundian
economies, the very economies our Page Mothers and Fathers had sought to
undo. It seems to me that to develop a sense of what consitutes "new"
now would have to take under consideration such things as "place,"
"identity" and some of the other taboo issues that we are always so
quick to dispense with when formulating our geneologies. And by "we"
here, I am in part referring to my white brothers, who have demonized
such practices as developing countercultural strategies as even those
employed by Bernstein, Watten, Sherry, Silliman, and others, who sought
to arrange a sub-cultural network for distribution, discussion, and
more, around new poets and their publishing activities.

Tangent-- History as Trangression

When I first gave birth to my desire to publish a series, Charles B.,
warned me to start small and develop a readership, which he might have
called a community, or a constituency. I had originally cooked up a wild
plan with Arkadii D., to publish books for cheap, printing them in St.
Petersburg on Finnish paper. We could get books for 10 cents in paper
back and 50 cents in hardcover. The only problem was they had to be
printed in editions of 5,000 or 10,000. Anyone can see the problem here.
And while I toyed with the idea of bilingual editions of Russian and
American poets, the idea of sending 8,500 copies to Moscow to be sold at
cigarette stands wasn't exactly what I had in mind.

The development of this community of readers has been my strategy from
the beginning. Focussing on publishing works by lesser-known poets, and
piggybacking them on those works by the likes of Scalapino, Bernstein,
and Silliman, just to name a few, was one means of accomplishing this
goal. And I hope that as my publishing venture reaches this point, this
crossroads, that it has been at least modestly successful in getting
works out there. But now I find myself in a troubling position.

Never in my wildest dreams did I want to be in the position of judge and
jury. The influx of manuscripts that trickle in now are all very much
worthy of being published, whether by my press or another of similar
outlook. But what is that outlook? One writer, in a review of Meow Press
for the Poetry Project Newsletter, likened the press to some kind of
establishment-oriented apologist for the State of New York, a
co-conspirator in what she termed "crimes" : SUNY-Buffalo and the
Poery/Rare Books Collection at that same school. Anyone who knows me
knows how much this slam hurt me personally, as much forged upon
misunderstanding and misreading as upon a failure to communicate. While
I was never mentioned in the review, it was very much a personal slam,
one which proposed to position MP as an establishment-oriented venture,
as a student of Bernstein, etc. But this connection, the institutional
affiliation is a problem, I realize, as it is something that I find to
be problematic, and has been my critique of the poetics program in
general, or any poetics program, such as that at New College of
California, San Francisco State, and others.

For me the role that institutions play in this development of literary
groups and histories in general is a disturbing but real presence. These
schools go a long way to reproduce the very formal preoccupations which
brought them together, indeed exceptions at Iowa and Buffalo are still
rare. But, rather than some ideological cloning, I think that it is
within the institutional structures the very social fabric which permits
editorial behavior is patterned. This pattern is then continued
"outside" where the institutional preoccupations are transformed into
more social-only networks. If you look at the globs of graduates from
x-school, I think you will find this to be the case. And athough I don't
think that such a fact has to be always bad, I will again restate my
general theory of editing scenes, zines, and presses: such editing is
generally all "social" and that the ideological fallacy most usually
presented has some sort of connection to what Perloff so rightly decried
as "innovative." For instance, to most people the difference between
n-th generation New York School and n-th generation language poetry
would be negligible. Indeed, a friend of mine, an MFA at San Diego State
U., recently called Quincy Troupe a "language poet" -- something which
made me swallow the very salt I had thought to pinch for the grain's
taking. So within these various networks of the "innovative" - a term so
vapid as to be utterly meaningless - there are infact social groupings
which have meaning and importance to those who inhabit them. And while
the Page Fathers are looking for younger poets to pick up the stick to
formulate some sense of the newness which was their poetics heritage
(nudge nudge Ron, nudge nudge Bruce), the Page Mothers (especially in
San Francisco) have perhaps been responsible for a whole generation of
younger women writers who have emerged with similar interests and
concerns, social and theoretical, some of which were articulated at the
conference.


Lesbian Disco, or why I can't dance

Listening to and watching Pamela Liu and Renee Gladman address the
conference, it occurred to me that while they may have appeared on the
"futures" panel almost as an after thought, an accusation I haven't seen
supported, they were the greatest and truest representation of the
future. Indeed, a bomb went off in my head, one which told me that I was
irrelevant, outdated, uninteresting. I felt swept aside by the
convincing nature of their presentations, their motivated commitment to
what they are doing and their peers. And one of the great problems with
this conference was that not everyone could make it. A very west coast
phemenon, the pre-eminence of Bay Area women (younger and older) should
have been of interest to everyone--on this list and otherwise. The
silence from Buffalo on this front has been very telling for me, the
silence and seeming disinterest coming from New York. Not everyone could
be paid and invited, but it seems to me that this conference was either
something you are interested in or not--and that some of the disinterest
was based on not being invited. One criticism I do have of some of the
would-be attendees, is this almost universal sense of the need to be
recognized, and the bitter whining that went on at least here on the
west coast, regarding who would be or wouldn't be invited is perhaps a
bigger epidemic than I can address here. But Pamela's and Renee's
presence on the panel stood in for much wider happening, one they
addressed in their talks with great generosity.

When Dodie and Kevin came to Buffalo in the Fall of 1997, they spoke of
this range of younger writers, almost none of whom I had heard of. It
was as if this incredible world had opened; so many things to learn
about-- so much to read and discover. My world had been dominated by the
New York scene, past and present, and by the historical Bay Area, from
Jack London to the departure of Ben Friedlander, who was my primary
source of Bay Area history and intrigue. And despite the fact that it is
a literary community now run by "middle aged women" as someone put it at
the end of the conference, the history of the Bay Area, with a few
exceptions had been a primarily male history. So you can imagine how
exciting it was to hear of this community in development.

What I learned from Pamela and Renee may not be so easily put into
words, and hopefully I will continue to learn from them as their works
reach a wider audience though the underground small press economy of
which I have been a part. When I voiced my sense of being irrelevant to
a friend after the conference, the response was sheer dismissal-- i.e.
that my press was an important press of new work, within this
subeconomy, etc. and that I shouldn't feel that way. But being relevant
here isn't about being in a position of power, though my "power" is
completely relative, and the use most people seem to have for me seems
completely instrumental anyhow.  I sensed that magazines such as Clamor,
Outlet, Proliferation, and many others (including the glossy Lipstick
11) were involved in this community building effort-- often through the
use of materials gained by theft, recycle-bin diving, and creative
misuse... an economy of production very close to my heart. The
development of these editorial and publishing collectives,
scene-building in the area of San Francisco, Berkeley, and Oakland--
this is the creation of the kind of literary community that will develop
its own methods of extending their poetical discourses into the world at
large.  By that I mean that these women (and some men, as it doesn't
seem to be exclusively one thing or another) will establish their own
networks for the the development of the kind of poetics theorizing that
both Silliman, Perloff and others (even myself) have called for at
times. That theorizing is going on, but it will be excellent to watch
them undertake this project as they begin to aquire power and authority
(a dangerous trade-off, as I have discovered), as they age, as another
group of upstarts seeks to establish themelves in the wake of this
intensely interesting group of women writers. All of it is so new to me.
During the conference I was suddenly blinded by the shock of their
brilliant glow and I wished that more people of this community had made
it down, as the Conference was one of those landmark historical events
which will only grow in significance as the histories of it get written
and rewritten.

Just as for me the New Coast Conference in 1993 was a formative
experience, one which inspired me to do what I do now, I hope that they
will have a similar sense of the Page Mothers. But it isn't for me to
write that significance, and perhaps they will have cause to have a
conference of their own, wherein such poetical exchanges can include
more of their contemporaries.

As we reach the end of the decade (I am less interested in the millenial
urge as I am 10-year clocks) such a re-thinking of how we do all this
might be in order. For me, I feel myself in a great crisis, one which my
brothers might not share. I felt a giant kick in the pants by the Page
Mothers Conference. And not to be a reactionary, not to ask how might we
white boys might best express our identity, or shore-up our hegemony,
but instead, how might we rethink our very sense of place in a world
which seems hell-bent at eradicating any real sense of difference as it
attempts to co-opt the very communities it seeks to include. Not
polarizing smallness, but how to proceed? For me, I am much more
interested in education (and not pedagogy) than I am aesthetic issues
these days, and that may be only the beginning of my dilemma. I live 15
minutes from Mexico and I know little about the poets there. The road to
Tecate is lined with police-- border guards. And on this note, my page
brothers here in San Diego will be the recipients of this
questioning--and my brother Bill Marsh and I had a wonderfully exciting
getting-nowhere-fast conversation about these issues-- and I know  even
my quick sunday morning portrayal of this question is complex,
incomplete, and only beginning. But we (four boys from s.d.) are
starting a magazine. Hopefully, some of you will see and feel the
results of our talks about this.

Thanks for your time-

with all due respect for the care that poets put into their work, it is
this sort of judgment that my whole professional life is devoted to
dismantling --cliches like "good enough to stnad the test of time" as if
that is or should be the prime consideration.  it seems to treat poetry
like a commodity (does it come with a lifetime guarantee, or only a
one-year warranty?  will i have to buy a new one in 5 years, or will this
last?)

Subject:      Page Mothers Report, part 3
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi, it's Kevin Killian.  This morning I will try to finish my report on
last weekend's Page Mothers conference (March 5, 6, 7) at UCSD & I
apologize for going on and on at such length (bandwidth) about it.  The
question of the tone that Mark Weiss didn't hear at the conference--the
anxiety that women writers might lose the ground they've recently
gained--well, it's funny, because I felt it throughout, from Hejinian's
exhortations that every day one must wrest victory from defeat and fight
all over again, to the constant use of the word "erasure," which one heard
again and again (e.g Harryman accusing Perloff of having erased the work of
every woman in the room) and then in Dodie's speech to the conference of
course, she evoked the spectre of Marc Lepine, the Canadian engineer who in
early December 1989 walked into the University of Montreal and killed 14
women, and wounded a dozen others, simply because feminism had ruined his
life.  (Dodie spoke in the context of backlash in general, particularly a
weird phone message she got at her office accusing her of feminism for
having invited nine women to read at Small Press Traffic during this month
and next.)  (Check it out.)  But I do appreciate that all of us who were at
the conference came away with different takes on it and I hope that my
example will show that hey, write something about it, it doesn't have to be
complete, nor even interesting per se.

So, there we were in this luxurious faculty club listening to Maureen Owen
read, I had never heard her before, nor even realized that her many of her
poems have alternate titles, nor the funky surrealism of her poetry,
sometimes charming, sometimes a little Brautigan-esque.  The showpiece was
a longer and more intense poem about another true crime, a Muslim NY woman
who, not wanting her children to grow up in a racist world, pushed them out
of the window of their 12th story apartment building, this chilling poem
very much in the Sapphire vein that looked deep into a disturbed mind and
located the listener there, identification and analysis hand in hand.  When
Bernadette Mayer began reading the crowd really sat up and cheered.  She
too read of a crime, the poem she wrote for Scott Gibson's forthcoming
"Blood and Tears" anthology of poems for Matthew Shepard, the young gay
student who was beaten to death in Laramie late last year, his body left
tied to an old fence so that passersby thought he was a scarecrow.  Perhaps
for many of us this was our first exposure to Mayer, so she embodied
something of the "revered figure" that Leslie Scalapino had warned us about
earlier, the living legend.  Her "livingness" also, miraculous as it seems
after her near-fatal stroke a few years back, and her remarkable recovery,
has to it a Gothic edge, like the Ancient Mariner (though she's not exactly
old of course), perhaps we are simultaneously drawn to and repelled by
someone who has "died" already and come back, or is this just me, and in
any case is it wrong to say?  She gave a great reading and could make
money, I think, just by selling tapes of her little laugh.  After the
reading many went on to a lesbian dance bar, "Flame," in San Diego proper,
but I was kind of beat and made Dodie take me back to the hotel bar where
we sat listening to a piano man sing the old time melodies of the 50s and
60s and talked with Fanny Howe, Owen, and Mayer, over a whole slew of
Cosmopolitans far into the wee hours of the morning, talking about
everything that had happened at the conference, and many many other topics
including our old late friend Bob Flanagan.  Fanny announced she had a
crush on Piero Heliczer after reading his poems in the new issue of "Shiny"
magazine, and Owen and Mayer reminsced about the real-life Heliczer and how
she, Howe, was lucky not to have run into him in real life in late 60s NY
because he was a menace and completely mad.  Dodie had me give the pianist
money to play her theme song, "My Funny Valentine" (her birthday is
Valentine's Day) and Bernadette got me to ask him to play (but I forgot to
ask for what reason) "Under the Boardwalk" and he did.

The next morning we spent packing and then squeezed into the little
convertible of Standard Schaeffer with Lauren Gudath and Pam Lu, and all
our luggage and then on to breakfast on the same block as the Faultline
Theater, where Stephen Cope and Joe Ross were setting up for this massive
poetry reading  featuring many of the participants in the conference.
Well, we've all been to this kind of thing before, but this was an
especially interesting reading and much more lively and fun that it had any
right to be, for the program was a long one and the space isn't all that
big and plenty of people came to hear and see and unwind, and people could
only read for 5 to 7 minutes otherwise they would be put in jail (a prop
for the current Faultline production, there was an actual jail cell on
stage, with Lee Ann Brown sitting in it.)  For one reason or another, Cope
had figured out the order of the program should be in reverse alphabetical
order, a delightful decision that always had one guessing who would read
next.  It must have been great for those, like Scalapino and Mary Margaret
Sloan, who usually bring up the rear at these mass events, and I think we
should try it in San Francisco.  Thus the reading began with Bobbie West, a
local San Diego writer whom I had never met and whose book "Scattered
Damage" from Meow Books is terrific.  Bobbie, if you're on this list,
please e-mail me your address so I can send you the money for the book you
signed for me.  The next reader was Diane Ward, whom we had missed seeing
at the conference but who proved available to come to this Sunday reading.
It was great news to hear that Littoral Books is going to bring out a book
by Ward and I told her, I would have walked to San Diego to hear her read
for five minutes, she is the best.  Or perhaps the best was Juliana Spahr,
who read her wonderful poem "We," really I think (I'm thinking now) her
masterpiece, this expansive, inclusive, hyper-realistic yet surreal poem
about constituency, foreignness, and enduring love.  This reading had a
valedictory quality to it, as many readers had o up and leave as soon as
they had finished reading, for their shuttles were there to take them to
the airport, so I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to many, you're there
one moment and then you're gone, just like "life"!  Anyhow I see I'm
running out of time and I didn't even write down a list of all the readers,
all of whom did very very well, so I will try to condense myself.  Dodie
and I were extremely pleased and proud of the good showings put on by the
young San Francisco writers, including Giovanni Singleton, Kathy Lou
Schultz, Renee Gladman, Pamela Lu and Taylor Brady; Bill Luoma brought down
the house as usual; Lyn Hejinian read from "Happily"; a duo of Jen Hofer
and Summi Kaipa brought off a performance piece based on Hejinian and
Harryman's collaboration "The Wide Road" (which I wouldn't have thought
could be done, but they did it); a young New York poet called Alastair
(sp?) Julian (sp?) of whom I had not heard was very touching; and then it
all seemed to wind up to a close with Dodie's reading from the "Letters of
Mina Harker" and Rae Armantrout wound up last, powerful, triumphant,
grinning and standing there, as wave after wave of applause washed over her
in thanks for her part in organizing the conference.

With Joel Kuszai, Joe Ross, John Granger, Stephen Cope, Rick Burkhardt,
Bill Mohr, Hung Q. Tu, etc., all living in San Diego and of course the more
established figures Michael Davidson, Quincy Troupe, Jerome Rothenberg,
David Antin, one did get the feeling there's a lot of writing going on in
San Diego but that it was largely a man's world, and so this female
incursion into its dominion had the effect of a dream.  Like many others,
I'm very grateful to Howe and Armantrout for putting on the event, and to
Kuszai, Granger, Ross and Cope for being so hospitable to us at every turn.
Yes, there was X amount of friction, yes the debates about inclusivity,
elitism, racism and revisionism hatched at the "Page Mothers" conference
will color our world for a long time to come, and yes I had a terrific time
and I hope they do it again.

hello elizabeth treadwell, with whom i would very much agree at least in
a need to have a little more careful approach to placing
expectations/obligations/ole fashioned desires on the shoulders of a
'younger generation' - we've heard this charge before, no?, from some of
the gatekeepers of 'language poetry' - that this lazy bunch of upstarts
aren't doing a damn thing to further the cause etc etc

there are so many obviously troubling issues with the form of this kind of
assigment - most notably, it seems to me, is that the work that this
'older generation' did is not only not my work, but was in large part
intended to allow me to avoid doing 'their work'- eg, my mom made it
possible for me to have a lot more options than to have to work all my
life to have space/time (as a woman or as anything else) to work -

a second very very needful point on which leslie scalapino spoke ,
according to kevin killian's report, at the pagemother's conference, is
the danger/stupidity of the tendency of poets to parent-worship -
scalapino probably did not use the word 'stupidity', but as one of the
'younger' who is so charged (by the 'older who have served their time)
with responsibilities to the world, tradition, the plight of women etc, i
do take much issue with the nonchalance with which  poet-writers
assume heroes, find it necessary to have pet influences and mythical
notions of some person behind the poem- and, if killian's sum was
right-on, i would agree with scalapino, that the cult of the revered
figure is rather in service of obliterating interaction with the writing
and if scalapino, in her argument against immersing oneself in some kind
of lineage, 'makes some abrupt jumps', all the more reason for actually
looking at the writing that she is talking about, no? - is it not about
time that chronology (and the presumed debt to preserve it) cashed in its
chips? - as one of the no-good 'younger' people, i feel quite fortunate
that i can be in cahoots  with books like on certainty, geographical
history of america, the new sentence, querlle, all this every day,
remebrance of things past, subterraneans, book of urizen
without having to always, as a sonny rollins-loving friend of mine once
said, worry the bridge

Just to piggyback on Charles' tweak re regionalism,,,,and to prove "the
more the meme chose"....some 20 years ago, I went on the road to a number
of places back east, and in the course of reporting on my findings to one
of my hosts, I said "I think we live in a time of multiple provincialisms."
To which he replied, "Oh, I dont think you'll find much of that here in New
York."  David

My wife, a School Psychologist, sees me as a classic example of a person
afflicted with Attention Deficit Disorder, among other things.  Maybe that's
what's behind my nervously impatient--on and off again short poem--approach to
poetry writing.  Or maybe it is because my poetry is preoccupied with
separating out the root erotics of the (w)rote from the perspective of the
routed: a kind of micropolitical sexual-textual economy of meaning and
moaning, mooning and, sometimes, mooing...

I'm fascinated by long poems because they represent something I can't seem to
do,sensibilities I can visit but not inhabit.  If I write 10 pages, my
characteristic impulse is to reduce them to 10 lines.  I tend to condense
rather than expand.  I'm more likely to remove words than add them.

When one does a long poem is intensity of experience sacrificed to depth or
duration?  I differentiate, by the way, "serial poems" from the long poem.
Serial works seem to kind of swing a little both ways...I like _them_, a lot.

Joel K. ("Daddy Page") raises so many issues of grand importance that I can
only begin to mull them over on this rainy San Francisco Sunday. First, I
want to say that at the time of the Poetics List Explosion, that "as a
woman," I didn't feel "excluded;" I felt pissed! There's a difference. The
goings-on reminded me very much of the time I have spent doing political
organizing and facillitating meetings in which a number of folks (yes,
predominantly male) seemed much more interested in disruption and
power-grabbing than in furthering any sort of positive action or discussion.
The accusations levelled against Charles B. concerning "censorship" seemed
to me simply ridiculous. I do not believe that Charles or Joel censored
anyone in their delicate handling of the Poetics List. Rather it seemed that
a number of men preferred to wage a pissing match with Charles--and Charles
rightly declined to participate. I believe it was correct to shut the List
down and regroup. And I hope now that people will begin to participate with
a renewed sense of vigor.
A very real impediment to this participation is, I think, time. I know that
when I've been working 10+ hour days in the high-tech publishing industry,
I've simply been too exhausted to reply to the Poetics List. But I've made
valuable connections here, and found out some important
information--including the announcement of the Page Mothers conference.
I don't think I would have necessarily known about the Page Mothers
conference if I had not read about it here. No, I wasn't "invited," but I
felt it was very important to "show up" in all senses of that term. As a
girl from the working class, I've seen again and again the futility of
waiting to be invited to the table, so have set about making my own place
there.
That's much of what Lipstick Eleven is about. (In the "official" history I'm
about to record) Jim Brashear and I co-founded Lipstick Eleven. We developed
Issue No. 1 along with Catalina Cariaga and Roxane Marini. We worked as a
collective. In terms of "identity" we were about as diverse a group as one
could assemble in terms of race, class, gender, and sexuality. What brought
us together was a shared poetics, the experience of having been "outsiders"
at SF State, and friendship. For me, the experience of this publishing
project is very much about the love and friendship I have with/for my fellow
editors. I don't care if that's corny; it's true! And that's very much what
makes the project work, as well as what makes it difficult (and necessary).
After Issue No. 1, Roxane and Catalina declined to continue, but Jim and I
forged ahead, and when Robin Tremblay-McGaw approached us about joining the
Lipstick Eleven crew, we welcomed her with open arms. Robin is particularly
interested in chapbook publishing, and has opened up new vistas for us.
Another element that brought us all together is the teachers we worked with:
namely Myung Kim and Bob Gluck. They have both taught me a great deal.
More about the conference later--and I hope others will join in.

hi.
my name is derek beaulieu and i am a rather new addition to the UB Poetics
list having joined in just the last few days. i thot i should drop the list
a note and introduce myself (as well as my press - housepress). ive been
writing for only a few years - strongly influenced by the work of bpNichol,
steve mccaffery, and the poetry of darren wershler-henry and damian lopes.
    i am also the editor and publisher of housepress - a small press
dedicated to concrete poetry (and other forms as well) published in
chapbooks, pamphlets, postcards, and ephemeral forms
    - saw in the archives and inquiry abt "keyboard po(e/li)tics" quiet a
few months back - that was a chapbook exploration that neil hennessy and i
wrote (a "pataphysical and oulippan look at the typewriter keys). anyway -
enuf abt me - its good to be here and do hope to participate in some
discussions and learn a  great deal while here...

I still have lots of copies of _Tinfish_ 7: please buy copies for $3 ($2
under the usual price).  The covers are unique Pacific region weather
maps by Gaye Chan.  The journal features poets from the Pacific region;
expect to be surprised!  I haven't yet put this issue on the web, and
won't until I get more business.

Back issues are also available at a discount.

Kathy Banggo's _4-evaz, Anna_ is being reprinted for the third time;
it's yours for $4.  Hawaiian Creole English and standard; lyrical and
tough.  A "best seller."  Much taught at the University of
Hawai`i-Manoa.

I'll be going to the AWP conference in Albany in mid-April and would be
delighted to hook up with listees.  Will be spending a few days in

interesting musings, joel, and i appreciate your heartfelt commitment to
what you're saying.  i don't think i knew about the pagemothers conference.
so i didn't go.  i think it's fantastic that folks are finally recognizing
ntozake shange as part of this feminist textual expansion --i remember
mentioning her and her "scene" on an MLA panel a few years ago (with m
davidson and e dorn) and feeling that i was a fish out of water, though
certainly nobody (except dorn) was hostile (and he was not hostile to me as
a person, quite the contrary, very gracious, but our talks were
diametrically opposed in sentiment, conviction and dare i say ideology).
also i'm glad, though i agree with the caveat about turning certain persons
into icons, that there can be this kind of celebration since it is obvious
that women have an enormously influential location i the "new poetries"
--in fact, and i've said this before on the list, it was my concern with
"women's writing" that first led me to "language" type poetry; it wasn't
until i met charles b and some of the other guys at the louisville
conference a few years ago that i even read these guys's work, let alone
their theory and a few decades of internal debate (true confession time; i
also have never read hamlet, and i hold a tenured position in an english
dept).  and i agree with kathy lou schultz that the "opposition to power"
expressed by some of the guys in the days leading up to the List Implosion
was misdirected at charles and certainly had overtones of competitive
oedipalism.  i for one  have not been especially engaged with gender issues
on this list because it doesn't seem the place to do this --it's exhausting
and the payoffs are few.  that's not what i use the list for.  as for the
perloff/harryman standoff, i have never met carla harryman (so don't know
her personal style etc) and i'm quite fond of marjorie, but she (m) is a
controversialist and often i just HAFTA disagree w/ what she says.  this is
a risk since she occupies such a significant gate-keeper position in the
field, but i think in the long run it strengthens the field to have diverse
positions articulated, even sharp disagreement, among equals.  so, carry
on, everybody --marjorie, carla, kathy lou, joel, henry, charles.
proliferation of subject positions is all to the good.

lit nat is a piece of hypertextual interwriting with all kinds of groovy
special effects.  as i'm a techno-neanderthal, and something of a poetic
neanderthal as well (though folks on the list have done an admirable job of
dragging me kicking and screaming into the present) i have no way of
knowing how much of a novelty this website actually is, but for me, it's
thrilling.

   Without entering an imbroglio over the test of time, which in
fact isn't *quite* as easy to dismiss as all that, I would suggest
that the test of time as applied to commodities is just as likely
stolen from the world of art; commodites are being treated like
art, perhaps, rather than the other way around. In any case,

half the writers talked about on this list have passed, or are passing,
subscribed to the notion, and the counter-traditions which have been
assembled comprise writers who have, yes, passed a test of time.
















a test of time, no?

TRAVEL ADVISORY; Poets Will Converge Upon Manhattan




Lower Manhattan has played host to poets and their movements for more
than two centuries. Edgar Allan Poe, Dylan Thomas, Allen Ginsberg and
e.e. cummings all embellished their talents, and occasionally their
habits, in the East Village, SoHo, the West Village, and the Lower East
Side. Next month poets from around the world will visit these historic
neighborhoods for the first People's Poetry Gathering.

From April 9 to 11, professional poets, amateurs and the curious will
partake in over 50 poetry recitations, conversation groups, competitions
and workshops. Although the festival is anchored at Cooper Union (East
Seventh Street between Third and Fourth Avenues), events will take place
throughout the downtown area.









Presented by City Lore, a New York cultural center, and Poets House, a
literary center and home to a 35,000-volume poetry library, the festival
will explore two primary themes: ''Masters of Oral Tradition'' and
''Emerging Forms and Formats.''

''Masters of Oral Tradition'' events will feature a performance by Utah
Phillips, Grand Master of the Rose Tattoo, a dispersed troupe of hobo
poets; Gabriel Segura and Rafael Perez Lopez, Colombian decima (10-line
verse) improvisers; and a picnic with the cowboy poet Don Edwards, a
former rancher and rodeo chaser.

A 10-round ''Heavyweight Poetry Bout'' between Sherman Alexie and
Patricia Smith and ''Braggin' Rights,'' a free-style street-corner
rapping contest, are planned for ''Emerging Forms and Formats.''

Other featured poets will include Robert Pinsky, the Poet Laureate of
the United States; John Cephas, the Piedmont blues musician and National
Heritage Award winner; and Galway Kinnell, winner of the Pulitzer Prize
and National Book Award.

Also planned are a supper in honor of Robert Burns, midnight readings of
erotic poetry and Edgar Allan Poe, a workshop for renga, a collaborative
36-stanza poem (saki provides inspiration after the sixth stanza) with
masters from the Spring Street Haiku Group, and a literary tour and pub
crawl.

in grave ink
*seriously new writing*
$4 one issue
$10 for one year (3 issues)

To privilege one form or style of poetry over another is not the goal of
in grave ink.  That is what we are trying to escape.  However it does
seem fair to point out that Canada does privilege a style, a form, even an
ideology, perhaps we could call it Nationalism, an attempt to create a
Canadian identity through poetry .  Whatever is at work in this closing
down of poetic possibility is not really what we care about.  We care
about poetry.  Poetry that moves, that breathes, that kicks and hogs the
covers.  Poetry that gets up in the middle of the night and steals your
food and money.  Poetry that is both alive, and living.

Although poetry is our main focus, it is not our only focus.  Any form of
writing and art that fulfills the above ideas of alive and living is
welcome.  Please let us know the borders that can be touched and crossed
in all forms of art.  If its new, seriously so, we want it.

So what's with the claim "seriously" new poetry?  Here we take writing
seriously but do not necessarily see it as having to be serious.  We enjoy
play with language, with form, with the edges of what is stylistically
possible but we play seriously.  We play with the belief that words still
have the power to change.

So that is a rough and rambling idea of what we are doing and what we
want to do.  If you are interested any help is welcome.  Whether this help
comes in the form of poetry, other forms of art, the act of reading or
even (shall I say it) subscription money, it is all appreciated.

1. Juicy excerpt from LYNNE TILLMAN's novella, LOVE SENTENCE,
the first in Double Lucy's 1999-2000 Prose Series!

"Everything Paige thought about love, anything she felt
about love, was inadequate and wrong. It didn't matter to
her that in some way, from some point of view, someone
couldn't actually be wrong about an inchoate thing like
love."

Lynne Tillman's most recent novel, NO LEASE ON LIFE, was a
Finalist for this year's National Book Award.  We have admired
her for ages & are proud to publish this funny, philosophical,
literary valentino, starring a favorite character of Lynne's,
Miss Paige Turner.

I find that I am now doing the same. I've taken about 50 pages of prose
(an abandoned novel) and whittled it down to about 60 or 70 lines. As I
continue the condensing, I lose more words, but start to add in
graphical elements that somehow take the place of words or sometimes
reinforce them or sometimes act alone. I think I do this because I am so
often overwhelmed by all that I feel I must take in. It's less like ADD
(at least for me) and more like autism (withdrawal or refuge from
overabundance). I feel like if I can just get down a few words and images,
then the kaleidoscope will stop turning for a few seconds.

As for the second part...

I don't know, having never written a long poem. However, I am considering
my current project as a long visual serial poem. The intensity of
experience for the creator of the short poem may be stronger than that of
the reader/viewer (although not necessariIy). I know that what I put
into 6 pages (which may contain all of 20 words) and an equal amount of
graphical elements takes me several months to build. I don't kid myself;
it can be looked at in about 15 seconds. I hope that you find things in
it that keep you there longer and keep you coming back. I guess I'm
saying that this is probably no different an experience than can be had
with a long poem. Except that there are more words and that means more
time, or duration. There, I've argued both sides.

It is still difficult for me to speak of Hart Crane.
        One ought to speak more severely than I do of him,
to pay respect to the reality of the person Hart Crane
(the person of the native inward site of emotional innocence)
and the personal seriousness of the poet Hart Crane
(in the period of his ascent into literary conspicuousness).
        Anyone attempting to comment on his work in a homespun style
would have to use plain guts to sustain the inevitable gaucheness
of paying such tribute, although I would not now credit him
with more than a militant outspokenness, the line of it lightning-like
        "straight" jaggedly bent
making a hit somewhere in the area of his excitability, a dazzlingness
actually soft in its outburst.
        Any literarily environmental definition of it,
especially in the wild-behavior manifestations of it,
earnestness of being, from sense of the specularity of it,
the rapturous seizures, his energetic enthusiasm for poet-being,
the frenzies of exhibition of feeling-exuberances:  the inward site
where tendernesses, affections, impulses of kindest emotionality
[I say "emotionality," rather than "sensuality"] ranged in chaos:
He was preoccupied with the physical triumph of utterance of tradition
--the English tradition--and the twists in it to make room for himself,
his personal, single-minded, combative, conception of Heavenly Success
(I wonder if it ever did, if it ever could have, become altogether that,
to him).
One might say that will rather than thought was the sponsor of his
language.
        And the ringing-in, here, knowing what I know of Hart Crane,
with the affection manifested towards me when we
were in comradely association in New York, all agog
with literary self-consciousness:  who was going to be "successful,"
who might, actually, become "famous," who at least be rated
as a safe bet for the commitment of the critical watchers of the
candidates
for the word "good" for public whispering round.
        I cannot read any other story into what happened to him humanly,
a spectacular incurability and original confusion
in terms that combined the personal and the literary--what was happening
was a convulsive mixture of the two within an actually narrow
frame of experience (both personal and literary experience)
dedicated to poetic independence from hierarchic restrictions
and stupefying refinements for all the stress put on his having
given natural-poet-identity, no eccentric existing in a private
literary environment of his own.  The comparison has justification.
        Blake armed his poet-boldness with Art,
indifferent to others, yet courting them, making them listen,
by the forceful boast of indifferentness, as the opposite number
to the Hart Crane figure of quixotic self-expansiveness,
a pair of types couplable by a quite braggart singularity
and grasp of the nature of critical literary learning.
        In this period of my thinking, my formulating of my thinking,
I called the individual unreal:  not just a process of reaction to
existence
as an environmental aggregate, the body of experience en masse,
that to which one was involuntarily, almost helplessly, exposed.
        I can identify this environment in-the-large of individual being
as collective, synthetic, reality, in so far as it is real, not
something locked
within a frame of existence that makes of one the reactions it excites
in one.
        It has surprised me that I could then stretch my loyal regard
across the widening breach, and encompass the whole in an appreciation
both fervent and sad.  I called the individual unreal.
        Would it have been any different if I had lingered beyond 1925?
        I had moved far away from the New York scene.
        It is still difficult for me to speak of Hart Crane.

Maria,

I agree with you that it's "fantastic" (you're so much more enthusiastic
than I am, Maria) that Ntozake Shange is being recognized in this
area--however I had lots of problems with how she was discussed at the
conference.  I felt there was lots of amnesia and revisionism going on.  I
got involved in the SF experimental feminist scene in the early 80s after
having been reading more traditional feminist stuff for 10 years--and at
that time I thought Shange was great--the whole country did.  But when I
learned the new theoretical feminist cannon, Shange was never taught, never
mentioned--as far as I remember.  Though Shange does some marvelous stuff
formally, she was overlooked by the intelligensia--because of her populist
surface, I imagine.  She was someone, I felt in my younger impressionable
years, that one gave up--like Plath, like Adrienne Rich, like Gilbert and
Gubar--if one wanted to be a serious experimental feminist.  The only black
woman I can remember being acceptable was Erica Hunt (Harryette Mullen was
still early on in her career; later, of course, she got noticed).  These
are just my memories from my "youth," which, as we all know, can be very
reductive.

Interestingly, one guy posed a question to my panel about class--and I was
all ready to speak--finally this could be talked about because it is an
important issue, I feel, one that is denied over and over again--and
somebody besides me and Kathy Lou Schultz thinks so.  Laura Moriarity said
that class differences were breaking down--something I disagree with, which
is odd since I usually agree with Laura.  But then Carla jumped up and
started yelling at Marjorie and the issue, once again, got swept under the
rug.

Dear Friends of Torque,

As I prepare the next issue of Torque for publication, I find myself at
a frustrating crossroads. While sales of the Torque + Object
collaborative issue were good, they were not good enough to compensate
me and Rob for the money we spent, from our own pockets, to get the
issue out. The balance of my Torque account, therefore, is not
sufficient to cover the cost of the next issue. While I desperately want
to get the exciting new issue of Torque into print and distributed among
Torque’s faithful readers and contributors, I can’t do it without the
funds. I don’t need much more money; if fifty more people bought copies
of the Torque + Object collaborative issue, I would have enough, from my
share of the proceeds, to print Torque #6.

There are still plenty of copies of the highly successful Torque +
Object collaborative issue, featuring work by 25 innovative poets. The
collection has been touted by many readers and correspondents as a
fantastic and fruitful collaborative effort to bring together so many of
today’s most interesting and adventurous writers. I urge you to order a
copy today if you don’t already have one, to buy a second if you do, and
to tell anyone you know who hasn’t ordered a copy to do so. Copies of
Torque #4 are also available. Order now if you don’t have this issue.
The sooner the orders come in, the sooner Torque #6 will be in print!

Thank you for your continued support.

To order, send checks made payable to Elizabeth Fodaski to:
Elizabeth Fodaski
21 East 2nd Street #14
New York, NY 10003

Torque #4 is $6. The Object + Torque collaborative issue is $10. Please

I will be your pattern because it's clear
there's a pattern to be made and I will be your maid
and clear up the pattern made from fear
of the lumpenproletariat welling up from your maid
who you will have made thinking that always
beyond the shame there is always another maid
who will wash away that pattern while you steer
clear of what you have rigorously made
defining pattern beyond repetition, that is:
the rigour of the maid. every pattern has its
marx to upwell from the pattern. every maid
dreams of jenny and black freighters.
you only think of patterns and spinning jennies
you think you made.

Hi all,
Maria Damon says that she doesn't like to discuss gender issues on the list
(the payoff being negligible and the irritation high?) but that is one thing
that keeps me turning to the list, even tho it can get ugly.  I've felt in
the last few days that its been really really interesting and not at all
ugly, not at all implosive, with Kevin and Joel and Kathy Lou weighing in on
Page Moms etc, and was very pleased to see Rachel's response to my
"delinquent daughter" query.  These gendered concerns aren't quite separable
from that nebulous thing that might be called my poetix.  Tho reading Joel's
essay/epistle made me think bringing up delinquent daughter questions here
might be talking out of school if that is the right phrase.  I just hope the
lurker women keep on or start speaking up. I really do.
Briefly,
Elizabeth

Dear Poetics List:

So many of you expressed interest in attending the inaugural conference of
_The Modernist Studies Association_, "The New Modernisms" (Oct. 7-10, 1999
at Penn State University), tham I am posting our "brochure," which lays
out the procedure both for submitting proposals and for registering for one
of the sixteen available seminars listed below.

We begin by presenting a list of the plenaries and special sessions
appearing at the conference.  As plans develop, one or two additional
plenary sessions may be posted on our website
<http://www.psu.edu/dept/english/MSA/msa.htm> and will appear in our
full brochure (still in production).

Cassandra Laity
on behalf of the _MSA_ Program Committee
_______________________________________________________________________________
The New Modernisms

The Inaugural Conference of the Modernist Studies Association

October 7-10, 1999


The Nittany Lion Inn

State College, Pennsylvania


About the Conference

The recently founded Modernist Studies Association is devoted to
the study of the arts in their social, political, cultural, and
intellectual contexts from the late nineteenth century through the
mid-twentieth century. The organization aims to develop an
international and interdisciplinary forum to promote exchange among
scholars in this revitalized and rapidly changing field.

The conference will feature three kinds of organized discussion: 1) plenary
sessions, each with two invited speakers and a respondent; 2) seminars,
small group discussions (maximum of 15) based on brief essays which the
participants submit in advance; and 3) panels, each with a chair and three
20-minute presentations.  The design of the conference should allow each
participant to attend the plenary sessions and participate in a seminar
and/or a panel.


Plenary Sessions

"Modernism, Race, and Nation": Peter Nicholls (University of Sussex),
Houston Baker (Duke University), and respondent Kathryne Lindberg (Wayne State
University)

"Modernism, Feminist Criticism and Identity Politics": Susan Stanford
Friedman (University of Wisconsin--Madison), Rachel Blau DuPlessis (Temple
University), and repondent Bonnie Kime Scott (University of Delaware)

"Literary Modernism and the Visual Arts": Charles Altieri (University of
California--Berkeley), Philip Weinstein (Swarthmore College), and respondent
Wendy Steiner (University of Pennsylvania)


Special Sessions

The program committee has arranged special sessions on Modernism and
"Redefining Modernity" (Rita Felski, University of Virgina); Modern Art
(Patricia Leighten, Duke University); "Middlebrow" Culture
(Ann Ardis, University of Delaware); The Marketing of Modernism
(Mark Morrisson, Pennsylvania State University--University Park);
The Editing of Modernist Texts (Robin Schulze, Pennsylvania State
University--University Park); Modernism, Science, and Technology
(Susan Squier, Pennsylania State University--University Park);
Modernism and Post-Colonialism (Guari Viswanathan, Columbia
University); and The London Literary Scene, 1911-1916 (Caroline
Zilboorg, Cambridge University)


Call for Panel Proposals and Seminar Registration

Individuals may submit a ranked list of two or three seminars and/or a
proposal for a panel.   Since we can accept only a limited number of
panel proposals, we encourage all prospective participants to consider
participation in one of the sixteen seminars listed below. Seminar
assignments will be made on a first come/first served basis, beginning now
and extending to August 1st: the sooner you submit your selections, the
better your chance of receiving your first choice.

If you choose to submit a proposal for a panel, we encourage you to
register for seminars at the same time. If your panel proposal is not
accepted, you are still guaranteed a place in one of the seminars.  If
your proposal is accepted, you still have the option of participating
in a seminar.  The deadline for submitting panel proposals is June 1st.
The program committee will notify those who have submitted proposals by
June 30th.

Seminars

Seminars are small group discussions (maximum of 15) based on
brief papers (5-10 pages) that the participants submit in advance of
the meeting.  Seminars are an attractive feature of many professional
conferences.  They offer participants with related interests an
opportunity to meet and to engage in a conversation that may extend
beyond the conference itself.  We strongly encourage registrants to
consider participation in a seminar either as a desirable alternative
to, or in addition to, their participation on a panel.  All registrants
are guaranteed a place in a seminar, and will be sent a letter
confirming their presence on the program.  As far as travel funds are
concerned, academic institutions usually regard participation in a
seminar as equivalent to participation on a panel.

The program committee has organized the following seminars:

1. Modernism and Popular Culture
David Chinitz (Loyola University--Chicago)
   [25 word description still pending.  See the website for an update.]

2. Modernist Irony
Kevin Dettmar (Clemson University)
   [25-word description still pending.  See the website for an update.]

3. Modernism and the Victorians
Mary Ellis Gibson (University of North Carolina--Greensboro) and
Cassandra Laity (Drew University)
   How did modernists create narratives of artistic inheritance,
reflecting or diverging from their predecessors?  How did gender sexuality
and changes in publishing and distributing art shape these narratives?

4. Provincial to European: Constructing British Modernisms
Nancy Gish (University of Southern Maine--Portland)
   How has political and poetic devolution in contemporary Britain
challenged, displaced, or reconceptualized "English Literary Modernism"
constructed as Eliot's continuation of "the mind of Europe?"

5. New Approaches to the Harlem Renaissance
Robert von Hallberg (University of Chicago)
   [25-word description still pending.  See the website for an update.]

6. Modernity, Gender and Pan-Africanism
Cyraina Johnson (University of Notre Dame)
   This seminar invites papers addressing the relation between modernity
and Pan-Africanism, as seen through the prism of the late 19th- and
early 20th-century constructions of race and gender.

7. Modern and Contemporary Women Poets
Linda A. Kinnahan (Duquesne University)
   This seminar invites papers exploring how contemporary women's poetry
is connected to/affected by/read in relation to the continuing recovery
and (re)reading of women modernist poets.

8. Modernism and Queer Theory
Colleen Lamos (Rice University)
   What is the relation between modernist aesthetics and the emergent
psycho-medical discourse on homosexuality? How does queer theory alter our
understanding of modern literature?

9. Modernism and Pedagogy
Gail McDonald (University of North Carolina--Greensboro)
   Theoretical and practical approaches to modernist texts in the
classroom:  issues of  difficulty, allusiveness, and cultural
"capital."  What can pedagogy reveal about the assumptions and
aesthetics of  modernist experimentation in fiction, poetry, and the
other arts?

10. Recontextualizations of Modernism
Michael North (University of California--Los Angeles)
   [25-word description still pending. See website for an update.]

11. Modernism and the Jewish Writer
Alicia Ostriker (Rutgers University)
   Discussions of modernism in Jewish poetry and fiction, in terms either
of formal experiment, or thematic concerns such as the immigrant
experience, the Great War, changing gender roles.

12. Modernism and Post-Colonialism
Leonard Orr (Washington State University)
    What is the impact of post-colonial theory on modernist studies? How do
modernist texts represent double consciousness, syncretism, and the trauma
of diaspora?

13. Modernism and Politics
Stan Smith (Notthingham-Trent University)
   The modernism of Eliot, Pound, Yeats, Wyndham Lewis, Lawrence, etc.
seems inextricably linked with a right-wing authoritarian, hierarchical,
and masculine politics.  Is the conjuncture merely coincidental, or are
there deep structural reasons for the link?

14. Modernism and the Law
Robert Spoo (University of Tulsa)
   This seminar will consider authors in various legal contexts, including
(but not limited to) obscenity laws, customs and postal regulations,
passport restrictions, copyright and libel laws.

15. Modernism and the Occult
Leon Surrette (University of Western Ontario)
    Papers of a critical and scholarly nature are invited on occult topics
in modern poetry or fiction and/or occult writers.  By "occult" we mean a
hidden ("occult") tradition of religious belief, or secret ritual
practice.  Secret societies are a different category.

16. Modernism and the Canon
Keith Tuma (Miami University, Ohio)
   This seminar will explore how we might represent British modernist
literature in a post-national and post-canonical American academy in
which the once-privileged position of "British" literature is increasingly
a thing of the past.

Seminar assignments will be made on a firstcome/first served basis
beginning now and extending to August 1st.

Please submit a ranked list of two or three seminars to:

Sanford Schwartz
Department of English
The Pennsylvania State University

University Park, PA 16802-6200

Fax: (814)863-7285
E-Mail:  sxs8@psu.edu

Once the assignments are completed, each seminar leader will contact the
other members of the group and set a precise timetable for the exchange of
materials.  The general guidelines are as follows:  around mid-July, each
participant sends a one-page precis to all other participants in the
seminar;  around the beginning of September, each participant sends
his or her essay to all other participants.

The program committee welcomes proposals for panels, though only
a limited number can be accepted.  The committee is especially
interested in interdisciplinary topics. Please include the following:
your name, session title, professional affiliation, mailing address,

The talk went by pretty fast, even by Marjorie's standards, but I thought
that she was in fact taking them to task. I wonder if othersnperceived this
differently.

3/16.  Dactyl Foundation.  65 Grand St.  NY.

Why did you come here.  To observe a space.  What space.  Any space.
Voices attached to faces.  Whose face belongs to what voice.  Are you
here.  What is 'there' to being 'here.'  Who is where you are is why
you are not here is why I'm here.  So there.  The effort it takes to
hold a face in focus. Whose name does it belong to?  Envelope, bookmark.
Did that send you?  Upend you.  I arrived early and well how have you
been?  Is it possible that a real face might attach to the name here.
Names here. Marcella Durand.  Duncan Dobbelman.  Lisa Jarnot.  Heather
Ramsdale.  Dan Machlin.  Henry Gould.  Kristen Prevallet.  Laird Hunt.
Garret Kallenberg.  This is an art space.  "Did you see the collected
prose in two lines?"  "There's so much more stuff."  "Incredible like
prose things going on."  "It's not even in the James Laughlin stuff."
"He's got a CD."  You keep looking for omens.  What do you hear.
What are you near?  I got an invite.  It convinced you.  A sign.
Is this the new city?  Show up on bare hope.  People keep making poetry,
only the faces change.  Who is making what up.  Invisibility.
It's good to go somewhere and wind up there.  Hi Kids! Don't talk
to them.  Marcella Durand:  "Nearby are more circuitous routes"
(reading "Artery").  Duncan Dobbelman's Gaspard--reading too close to
the page--and the Five Fingers:  literary-scholastic.  Lisa Jarnot:
"Thanks Garrett I didn't understand what you said."  (You Armadillo).
Heather and Garrett's collaborative piece, "Bodies Correlating through
some Medium"--wit, charm, but what's the difference between dialogue
and counterpoint?  Voices set off or slide off one another,
presentational, encased, enclosed.  Dan Machlin:  "a Joseph's coat of
outward desire."  The line, "I am perpetually okay" draws a laugh from
the polite audience.  Henry Gould:  "Your move, Beatrice."  Gould's
verbal improv, sound play, parodies folk/country speech rhythms
(can you hear anything you make fun of?) Prevallet:  Cocteau trans.
in next issue.  "Birds are our friends."  "Marble is very influential."
Laird Hunt:  old french poem about a horse.  Exercises de style.
Everyone here has gone to a good school.  Sweet, well educated, voices.
BiblioPHILIA, not BiblioMANIA.  Jarnot's voice had an engine running
under it.  Maybe Dan Machlin's.  Albertine as I was leaving:  "I've got
feelings too."  See you later, maybe.  Some poems I respond to in
"The Friend":  "The Human Face" (Artaud Morpion/Artaud parasite) trans.
Jonathan Skinner in issue 2, April 1998, and Skinner's note on "Grace"
in issue 3, May 1998; see also Skinner's trans. of a poem by Ghrasim
Luca in issue 6, Nov. 1998 (where was Skinner Tuesday night?) see also
the "Selected Notes of Robert M. Larsen, ed. Kallenberg and Larsen, in
the Rosetta section of issue 6, Nov. 1998.  See also Alan Gilbert's note
on Marxist linguistics in I forget which issue.  Class is a language.
There are proto-piracies going on among these pages, along with a whole
lotta Lamartine.  Gaspard de la nuit?  French ponies?  peonies? poesis?
(In the voice of Rene Gladman):  Abuse your class privileges!
False translate the French Africans!  NOW.

yea, while we were in SD & antin was way out of fasion with the CFAP (so
mike D never talked about antin or what he was up to)....yada, yada.....
but the story of the sky poems is in some antin talk that he gave at UCSD.
he gets some grant to do this thing & finds this sky writer & antin says
that he always wanted to sky write a poem ever since he saw this sky writing
as a boy at coney island (or some other beach)...Harold Fox Fabulous
Furs...so antin says that he always imagined a fox with great fur....& the
sky writing guy in LA (the only one antin found on the coast at the time)
says, that was my dad--who sky wrote that. antin describes the sky writing
as interesting because the begining of a line would disappear before the end
of a line was finished, & though it was not as he imagined it, he found the
result to be interesting. (he did it in LA i think).

Yes, in response to Dodie Bellamy, I have to say it was absolutely
fascinating the speed with which this man's question was dismissed. Class
peeps out into the open briefly and then BAM! silence. Fascinating and
all-too-familiar. I thought Laura Moriarty was trying to point out (correct
me if I'm wrong here, Laura) that there are in fact working class and people
of color among "us" (experimental poet types). She seemed to be identifying
as working class and saying that the evidence of class can therefore be
"oneself."
I went up to "the man" asking the question afterwards and got his name and
address (he's Chris Beach--Hi Chris are you out there?) and he and I had a
discussion with Bobbie West about what had happened. They both seemed a bit
stunned. Me, I felt "same song different day" playing in my head and saw all
of my college experiences passing before my very eyes. I promised to send
them both my essay on class and experimental poetries that appeared in the
premiere issue of Tripwire (and I will--promise). Yedda Morrison, one of the
editors, was extremely supportive in helping me to bring this essay into
being. But there is MUCH MORE to be done.
Thanks to Dodie for raising the issue here.

I was interested to note the announcement for the Modernism Conference at
Penn State.

There's one blindingly significant point about Modernism Then and Now that
I bet doesn't get talked about at this Conference, to wit:

Of all the thirty or so people who created Modernism (in poetry and prose),
not a single one of them ever taught at an American  university. They never
did it, ever.

Off all the thirty or so people discussing Modernism at Penn State, every
single one of them makes a living teaching at an American university. They
do nothing else, all the time.

Hmmm . . .

I've been thinking about Rachel's post responding to E. Treadwell's & trying
not to disagree
with her as I like the serendipity of what she proposes (akin to an idea
Rachel
you've expressed to me before -- the idea that you do something and if
someone
else does something as a 'result' of that, that's just something else,
something they've done) but i just can't put stock in this kind of
separatism --
the way you would separate generations and things generated (poems from
people)

first, I agree with the troublesome "assignment" of continuing the project
of another generation, and to be acused of laziness for not outwardly
appearing to carry on the good fight makes at least one narrow assumption:
that the fight will take on a guise or method that is similar in its devices
and so immediately recognizeable as a continuation.  Yes we are doing a
different and a next thing, and the problem seems to be that we're not
acknowledging where we came from so to speak -- so we're perceived of as
having lost some ground. I don't see any problem in asking for evidence that
this
hasn't indeed happened in the form of 'statements of poetics or
positions' that work to clarify one's relationship to advances that have
been made -- especially where 'advances' may not be perceived as such
under the 'new' methodology, i.e. where certain techniques are rejected
as ineffective tools (the victim-centered poetry of the early women's
movement, e.g.).  Maybe the statement mode right now is sort of dead. No
one here I think responded to Rebecca Wolff's
"manifesto" posted a while back; though I'll admit that I'm guilty of
thinking about it & not being sure how to respond, or not being sure that
the list was a fertile place for a response -- though I would very much
like this list to be so --  or for this response, an issue I'm working
out in response to Joel's most recent post.


Nancy Shaw from the Kootenay School of Writing gave an interesting talk on
this point last night to a small audience at the Corner Shop here in
Buffalo.  The talk isn't published, she wrote it for this particular
occassion, but what she said is extremely pertinent to this situation.
She suggested  that the manner in which 'so called Lang poets' related their
poetics to the social (namely irony) had played itself out, that their
social effectivity was measured on 'modalities of difference' (analogy,
constructionism, subjective expression) as articulated in Watten's
"Bride of the assembly line" which were to some extent no longer useful for
charting developments. This I think may be why we're accused of not doing
anything, because we are constructing new modalities as it were.

(I find myself suddenly irritated by this 'we' i've been using, as it is
simply in this context a generational tag -- Nancy referred to the
'so-called under forties' -- and I don't feel particularly that there is
a 'we' that I'm related to (more than peripherally, of incidentally) in
any aesthetic sense -- but this might be part
of the 'problem' or at least indicative of how different the situation
is now then it was 70 years ago when, for example, there wasn't this list
to provide one with a sense of poetic kindredness -- a point I'm taking up
in my response to Joel).

Nancy discussed Sianne Ngai's "Poetics of Disgust"
(orig. pub'd in _Open Letter_) as making the sort of moves that Silliman
(et al?) had demanded (in Philly Talks)
but as being ignored as such, criticized on the basis of it's having
been carelessly read.  She proposed that a Poetics of Disgust works as a
"cultural poetics," a relation of poetics to the social 'in the
tradition of' Lang po, but structured with its own, although contingent,
ideaology.

it is perhaps this sort of connection -- a shift in modalities -- that
we are to be on the look out for, and that ought to be written about.
reviews can facilitate this if a book is read with the question in mind:
how is this doing something differently? How does it compare to this
other thing?  (and here i'm having a deja vu from talking to Leslie
Scalapino about a year ago, about what brought her to the lang po crowd
in the first place -- so i can see where it's easy to read her in terms
of a dis-connected geneaology, when really her geneaology is just
slightly 'other'). And finally what does this difference achieve that
the other thing couldn't?  That is, if you want to read poems as
possible sites of such cultural or political achievement.

Nancy does this, and her term for such is "Cultural poetics" (her term I
think) is a hybridization of
Birmingham School Cultural Studies and Poetics.  I found this point
confusing, as cultural studies as it is currently being imagined is at
once flaggelating itself for its lack of political/social effectivity and
reassuring itself that that's ok -- it's just a set of diagnostic devices,
and an intellectual and not necessarily a political tool (ut oh -- am i
to be accused of saying the intellect isn't a political tool?  or are those
days over?).   I would rather call it a Materialist Poetics (and here again
i
 wave in the direction of the response I'm preparing to Joel's post)

This brings me to the other sort of separation you Rachel (via Kevin via
Scalapino) would bring about in the name of not falling for
parent/hero-worship, not worrying the bridge, etc.  Because it seems to
me that you would dismiss a sort of personal/communal lineage altogether (a
canon even).  I don't think Scalapino would advocate this as she'll
readily tell you what her lineage is and how important it is to her.

I'd like to hear more about this nonchalance.  & what about material
rather than mythical notions of persons behind poems?  I mean I just
can't that gleefully feel like I'm interacting with writing and
that's great, and that's IT, because I'm constantly reminded of the
material circumstances in which poems are produced (and I may be
accussed of generalities here, but i'm referring to the poetry that
currently circulatees in and around this list, American poetry usually
emmanating from sub/urban areas many of which I have been too)  But I
wouldn't obliterate that writing-interaction either.  Maybe i'm limited
by my own condition, my need to be materially located, to feel poems in
some way connected to places.  I suppose
it's intellectually generous of you to read Scalapino's obtuseness as a
pointer to some 'originary'(?) sources, as a sort of self-effacement --
"don't sit here
trying to figure this out! read stein!" I think scalapino would agree
that though we shouldn't focus too much on the self, the self is mired in
particular material circumstances to which he/she responds (or she never
would have left her Oakland abode to see what all the fuss was -- the
fuss for example that turned into Perelman's _Writing/Talks_),
and that lineage is part of that circumstance, as is being handed down a
certain set of tools
and problems to work with or refuse.  I don't know what you mean by time
cashing in its chips -- is time playing poker and we're the cards, shuffled
about, operating only by chance?  There's too much intention in poems and
the circumstances under which they get circulated to run on that.

But I also think that it's not unreasonable to expect that some
position-taking be risked or some degree of indebtedness (not to the
dealer but to the ante)  -- or refusal -- be acknowledged.  I also think
it's
important to 'continue the project' so one doesn't loose too much ground
and risk worshipping the Ally McBeal of the new feminism in contemporary
poetics.  I'm interested in a cultural worker not some
mythological/fictional hero -- and the only evidence of that is in the
construction of a 'cultural poetics' or otherwise formulated responses
to poems and not in the poems themselves -- the reception/reaction of poems
are as important as putting them out there.

After a veritable proliferation of little magazines that serve the social
(and the political perhaps via the sort of networking they make possible) by
publishing almost exclusively a lot of poetry I take _tripwire_s conception
as a sign that people are ready to start having these sorts of
conversations.  That's exciting.

thanks for tuning in,
linda

Dear John Tranter and Others,
  I won't entirely dispute the implications of your posting on modernism
and the American University. But I would like to  refer you to Gail
McDonald's wonderful book, _Learning to be Modern: Pound, Eliot and the
American University- (Oxford, 1993) in which she explores American educational
history as a context for what Pound and Eliot learned in  Universities,
how the poets needed universities, and how universities needed them.
"Rewriting the syllabus of exemplary writers [Eliot did], revising the
rules of poetic decorum, and proposing new standards for the study of
poetry, Pound and Eliot emulated and contributed to the American academy's
reformation of its mission and curriculum as it evolved from
nineteenth-century religious college to twentieth-century research
university" (McDonald, vii).
  We would be honored if you would sign up for our seminar on Modernism
and pedagogy run by Mcdonald at the "New Modernisms" conference. There
will be several poets there as well--Alicia Ostriker, Rachel Blau
DuPlessis and others.

In response to John Tranter's observation on the Penn State Modernism
conference:

I admit that my own ambivalence about academic life, and its deadening
effects, is gratified by this riposte. And yet: would we rather have no
Modernism conference than one conducted by (American) pro scholars?

I certainly can't say with any authority that the situation of literary
artists inside and outside the American university is any different than it
was at the time of historical modernism, but common sense would suggest it
be so. To suggest, furthermore, that any academic is *not* profoundly
ambivalent about her or his occupation seems unrealistic at the least.

However, JT's response was intended as wit. Perhaps I'm responding off-mode.

the idea that modernism was created by 30 people is, i thought, the very
idea that new modernist studies is intended to put to rest.  if this
conference ends up being one more roster of Lives and Works of the Greats,
what's the point?

I've been following this "thread" with some interest over the last week or
so, and I would like to make one small contribution to this nascent
discussion concerning the issue of "class."  While I was not at the
conference (Buffalo to San Diego requires more dollars than I have or can
find), as I read the various comments and hear that the question of class
was raised--"what about class?"--I'm reminded of a series of "what about"
questions that have pervaded various discussions--academic and non--over
the last decade or so.  The interesting thing about the "what about"
question is that it tends toward implosion, pulling everyone and
everything into its center, though it is a center more often than not that
functions uncritically, tending to stand on a "moral" ground rather than
upon anything that makes "sense."  So "what about class?"  Yes, indeed, as
indelicate, and possibly polemical as this may come across (not my
intention), what about it?

Wittgenstein once wrote: "A philosopher says that he understands the
sentence 'I am here,' that he means something by it, thinks
something--even when he doesn't think at all how, on what occasions, this
sentence is used.  And if I say 'A rose is red in the dark too' you
positively see this red in the dark before you."  Is there an analogy to
be made here between "a rose is red in the dark" and the red we positively
see, fantastically, in the dark, and the shearing question "what about
class," or am I just grossly misunderstanding?  Still, I cannot
seem to get past the circularity of the question, the unstated assumption
that we indeed all *know* what 'x' is: "Imagine someone saying:
'But I know how tall I am!' and laying his hand on top of his head to
prove it."

I've gotten several backchannel requests for copies of my essay on class &
poetics entitled "Talking Trash, Talking Class:  What's a Working Class
Poetic, and Where Would I Find One?" I sincerely appreicate the interest in
this topic. The essay appeared in Tripwire: A Journal of Poetics No. 1,
which is edited by Yedda Morrison and David Buuck. If you are able, it would
be great to support the editors of this wonderful journal. The magazine is
available from Small Press Distribution in Berkeley, Calif.
(www.spdbooks.org) and has a cover price of $6. If you are having trouble
getting the magazine, let me know and I can send you a copy of the essay.
Thank you,

Hello All,

Just a brief collection of notes in response to list comments on class
and gender issues.

I weigh in with Elizabeth Treadwell, agreeing that for me, gender
concerns aren't really separate from my poetics.  And gender issues also
so tied up with issues of race and class and sexuality.  nearly
inextricable.  and that brings me to the class issue.  I have struggled
with how to incorporate class issues in my own work in a formally
interesting way without coming off as banal, this particularly difficult
in poetry.  I think both Dodie and Kathy Lou Schultz manage to address
class in a challenging and interesting variety of ways in their work,
Dodie in the Mina Letters and Kathy Lou in her Genealogy piece (part of
which, I believe, is in Idiom online).

Kathy Lou and I have been at work on a collaborative piece that deals
with issue of gender and language and in its own way, class.  or maybe
in addition what I mean to say is that there are certain class issues on
which the creation of the work is predicated. the notion of stolen
time--much of the work written while we're at our jobs, in between the
cracks.

a little notation about reading the fabulous Figuring the Word by
Johanna Drucker.  Struck by her discussion of how certain of her books
came into being, articulating events from her "personal" life and how
they shaped/informed her experiments with language/text/the book. I was
also struck by the sheer amount of time required to set the type for
some of these works and the apparent time available to her for
investigation and experiment.  Time and its relation to class.  to
production/enquiry/visibility.

Hard not to feel a sense of rage, envy, lust and so on.

My job calls so that's all for now.


oh--and next issue of tripwire is on gender issues.  looking forward to
that.
Robin Tremblay-McGaw

In Charles Bernstein's _Close Listening_, Johanna Drucker has noted in her
essay "Visual Performance of the Poetic Text":

"the aesthetic arenas in which visual experimentation takes on a developed
form in the first half of the century include Italian Futurism, Russian
Futurism, German and Swiss Dada, English Vorticism, Dutch De Stijl,
Anglo-American modernism, and, to a lesser degree, French modern poetry
and visual arts associated with Cubism and then Surrealism. In other
words, there was a visual component to almost every area of modern poetry"
(132).

Clearly, these movements in many cases played with or eliminated what most
people would call conventional typography. What I'm interested in (since
I'm at work on a project tracing the history of Lower East Side poetics
and poetry reading series) is whether there is a link between
typographical experimentalism and orality/real time performativity. That
is, can one say that the movements Ms. Drucker lists were also partially
characterized by their often rambunctious presentation of their works in
performance?  Does typographical experimentalism especially invite
utterance, performance in some way? If anyone could provide me with an
example or two (or a book that might say it all) of these movement's
propensity for performance (especially as that performance relates to the
way the text is built), I'd greatly appreciate it.  You can backchannel me

One way of looking at the political dimension, is to realize that
socialist concerns, feminist concerns, historical edges, may sometimes
become part of the work because they are integrated into the poet's mind
and activities, and ongoing personal focus..... For instance Susan Howe
seems to have developed a response to these dimensions, purely out of the
intricate dance of her mind around themes of historical violence and
tension that jabbed at her personally.  The poetics underlying her work is
very complex--i don't mean to suggest otherwise.  But some of the most
interesting political poets have responded to the social/political level,
by simply letting their own interests, concerns, despairs, play thru the
fabric of the writing they are doing.  Some poets grow this sense of
connectedness out of being activists.  Some like Howe out of a fierce and
personal immersion in historical data.  (i myself have never felt a
tension between an interesting formal approach and an awareness of class,
gender and other weights... They seem naturally related....) Even some of
the post-1970 generation who are thought of as theoretical
language-oriented writers eventually come to a flow where the formal
impetus and the political passion feel to be of a single push.  (i'm
thinking for instance of two Perelman books, favorites of mine: Face Value
and First World.)  This is a not to say that there aren't poetics theories
that address important concerns here (the shape and movement of form
against social contradiction as thought out by Brecht, Silliman,
Bernstein, McCaffery, have been important to me)  But poetix ideas
threaten in the current climate to take on a weight that i find a little
disquieting.  To some extent politics in the world precedes politics in
the word-processor.  The activist sensibility of the political person is a
substratum for the politix of the working poet.

getting poetics in digest form, it was very interesting that this
message came after KLS's post on class issues and so I'm thinking of
both at once...

one thing that's always been interesting to me about reading Stein (esp.
How To Write...) is that I can feel that she never worked retail in her
life or waited tables or whatever (don't know this for a fact, not a
stein scholar), and what did Eliot ever do? Artists that teach v. class
of artists of yore I think is a very interesting topic to dig into. What
does it mean to be a trust fund/landed nobility artist v. a
college-educated "bohemian" v. an out-and-out homeless artist (stein v.
stevens/williams; byron v. keats; marlowe v. shakespeare; whitman v.
dickenson; sorry I know this is neither litigation nor boxing, though I
think the stein/w.c.williams bout would be a good one)?

the question nobody seems to ever want to answer about there art: what
is it for?: it's going to pay for my kids' college, it's going to get me
out of the projects, it's going to save humanity/create a better world,
I don't know I was bored and passing time, I'm going to prove I'm
smarter/better/more educated/cooler than my dad/my brother/my
mom/him/her/you

I think some of these are luxuries that we all can't afford, others
can...but all seem to have an intrinsic effect on our resulting poetics.
I don't really know where I'm going with this, but I think it is
important to what we think of our fellow poets/artists and what
prejudices we may form against those that do "sell out" or put there
poetry on billboards/subways or read at inaugural events.

I'll go back to lurking now,

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi all,

I am laughing in response to John Tranter's note about the Modernists never
having TAUGHT, and the Panelists only having taught, and somehow it seems
hooked up with these conversations about Mothers and Daughters.  Hey, Ally
McBeal, fictional as she is, is a cultural worker, Linda! A cultural broker?

I think part of the problem is that I feel still quite young as a poet,
perhaps I do not understand my poetics and influences and 'points' NOW as I
will THEN. This is certain, no? But one problem with the definition of this,
'my', generation, X, NEXT, Diet Coke, whatever, is that we are in the long
and often quite voluble, dreary, and bossy shadow of the BABY BOOM.  (I am
also influenced by my material (girl) conditions in this tyedied collegiate
burg to feel so.) In this shadow, which also contains many a glimmer and
salvation, especially for a girl, left there by your mother's awkward,
glorious footsteps, it is often hard to find a mirror in which to see the
light of one's own self.  Especially when those who left said footprints and
leaflets and napalm are shining a flashlight through the typeface of Time
magazine into your eyes to see if you appreciate them & all they've done for
you.

Kathy Lou points out that there are people of color and working class people
among us (us = The Microwaveable Feast?), & so then there are also young
bratty people just pulling their brass tacks together too.   And if US can
include an even longer and wider history, all the better.  What about
Grandma and Gramps and your freaky 2nd cousins?

Its mysterious in here, do you know who your influences are?

What was R Wolff's manifesto?

John Tranter and others -- did Ford Madox Ford have any role in creating
Modernism?  I mean, is he one of the "30" cited?  Since he did, after
all, teach at an American university (well, college -- Olivet College
was the name of the place, as I recall).

Stein's series of lectures at Chicago and elsewhere in America were the
functional equivalent of a year (okay, at least a semester) as a guest
professor.  Is she one of the 30 creators?

Is Pound one of the 30?  Until they fired him for letting a dancer
friend sleep over, he taught at an American institution of higher
learning.

I hold no brief for academics, am not one myself, and hate to spoil a
good sound bite, but wonder thus in the interests of accuracy.

> The questions are:
>

I do almost all my writing on the Net - I literally make my texts with the
emacs or pico editors online. For me, working with avant-garde and philo-
sophical/experimental issues, there is an audience; the kind of work I do
is rarely published offline.

I also love the surprise of working online through conferencing and email
- as well as the incredibly wide demographics and international contacts.
And then it depends on what's meant by writing - I also do graphics,
video, use perl programming online, and so forth. The environment is
amazingly rich and active/activated.

And of course all of this brings cross-fertilizations, Deleuze/Guattari's
'rhizomatic' creativities on a world-wide scale.

> What are your aims and what do you see as the possible outcomes?
>
With the residency? Introducing experimental work, examining the
possibility of community/communal writing, and running workshops which
might involve post-structuralist/postmodernist thought.

Pushing writing from the older 'writing-degree-zero' to at least the
binary, if not the transfinite, dimension.

> What advantages do you see to working on the internet?
>
Audience and performativitiy (programming, using MOOs and MUDs and talkers
etc.). Or do you mean working with students? You're unclear here. If the
latter, then the ability to work one on one, looking at the text and not
at the writer, suggesting other resources no farther away than a URL.
Also, in relation to texts - the ability to close-read and intersperse
comments. One disadvantage may be the time necessary to reply, simply
because of the labor of typing.

> Were you able to set your own 'agenda' for the residency?

The agenda's not set yet, but I would say yes, although I would do this in
conjunction with past residencies - it's useless if it doesn't work. I
hope the agenda ultimately is somewhat dialectical, in other words.
>
> Do you see your work as being primarily education, or promotion of poetry,
> or as poetry mentor, or something else?

Again, I assume now you mean my residency? I look on my "work" as my
artistic output. I'd say in relation to the residency, all three of the
above, as well as learning myself, from others, thinking through the
possibilities of language on the Internet, the future of language in
general, new modalities of communition.

What happens when prosthetics are the order of the day, when there are no
more masterpieces, when information overload requires information manage-
ment, when it's no longer possibile to 'know oneself,' and so forth.
>
> Will there be objective evaluation of the work being done?

What is "objective evaluation" of work in general? I'm not sure what you
mean. I certainly hope and expect the staff of trAce to take an interest
in all of this and if I stray 'out of line,' to say something. And of
course the work will be in the process of continuous evaluation - perhaps
a kind of evaluation 'without standards.'
>
> How will you judge the success of the residency?
>
By a lot of things - whether or not other participants remain; the quality
and quantity of their participation; the quality of the work developing;
whether other participants feel they're benefiting.

> How do you see your own writing developing?

Always developing. I deal with the metaphysics and phenomenologies of
languages, including programming languages, scripting, etc. In terms
directly related to the residence, on one hand - probably very little
effect - and on the other - probably a great deal in terms of what may
emerge from community.

Yours, Alan

Poetry Reading:  SCANDALS IN THE HOUSE OF BIRDS

A Reading and Talk by NATHANIEL TARN

April 19th, Monday, at 6.30pm at King's College London in the Council Room
Entrance is free. All are welcome.

SCANDALS IN THE HOUSE OF BIRDS is the title of Nathaniel Tarn's latest book,
an extraordinary 'experimental' ethnography based on many years of work in
Guatemala.

The first chapter of this book (and other material by Tarn) is featured in
the latest issue of Jacket magazine, at this URL:

Re: Richard Carfagna's comment on Enslin.  The New NPF Enslin _Selected
Poems_ does not include excerpts from Enslin's long poems. Rather the
book is devoted to extensive selections from his many collections of
short poems. NPF is hoping to do new editions of Enslin's out-of-print
long poems (_Forms_, _Synthesis_, and _Ranger_) and his unpublished
long poem _Axes_.

Dodie, Kathy Lou, et al. -

About the class thing - I was responding to a point made by Marjorie Perloff
that many early language writers were white men who had been to Ivy League
colleges - true enough, but, I thought, too generalizing and disappearing of
the backgrounds of such important figures as Ron Silliman, Erica Hunt and
Rae Armantrout (just for starters) among the early language writers, not to
mention the genders of other early ones. My own background (education,
chances etc) happens to be working class and I find currently that I am
among the writers (from various classes) who are spending a lot of their
time making a living. I like the effect of class on people's writing, (and
like to observe and imagine it in individuals) but what class are we anyway?
Being an artist/poet/whatever with a working class background might mean
these days that though you have an open invitation to lunch with the
Baroness ( or to read in this or that place etc) you can't afford the time
or the air fare.

I don't think I said that I thought classes were breaking down - though god
knows I may have - but that experimental or innovative writing were becoming
somewhat meaningless terms, given the many kinds of work being published
under those general rubricks -- and that that was a good thing.

In retrospect, I liked the way Marjorie's talk shook things up - though I
regretted the attention it took from some of the other talks.  I found it
very interesting to be there in person - saying yes but what about this
event or person or fact which seems to refute this generalization(?) Usually
one reads these things in a book and just fumes away.

As currently my hands are almost numb from entering SPD's upcoming catalog -
I should say (type), while I have the strength - that I am very grateful to
Fanny and Rae for setting up such a unique, valuable and memorable
conference. That several people came up to Leslie Scalapino (whose talk
against literary lineage was great) to tell her that her talk had been
"brilliant" - and also that several of the talks - Myung's, Carla's,
Dodie's, Harryette's, and (agreeing with Joel here) Renee's and Pamela's
(there are other names I know I am forgetting) - were interesting in a
directly inspiring and enabling and challenging way. Not to mention one of
the most incredible group readings of all time that happened on Sunday
(thanks Stephen and Joe) -

Oh and I also don't think I quite said (Kevin) that computers were taking
over but that we are interacting with our media technologies in a way that
is changing us and our writing and that the way technology is changing does
seem to have something like a life of its own with which we we interact in
our own writing and thinking processes  - as is occurring here.

In a message dated 3/18/99 7:14:43 PM Hawaiian Standard Time,
LISTSERV@LISTSERV.ACSU.BUFFALO.EDU writes:

<< Nancy discussed Sianne Ngai's "Poetics of Disgust"
 (orig. pub'd in _Open Letter_) as making the sort of moves that Silliman
 (et al?) had demanded (in Philly Talks)
 but as being ignored as such, criticized on the basis of it's having
 been carelessly read.  She proposed that a Poetics of Disgust works as a
 "cultural poetics," a relation of poetics to the social 'in the
 tradition of' Lang po, but structured with its own, although contingent,
 ideaology. >>

Linda,  thanks for the long and thoughful post.  can you clarify the clause
"criticized on the basis of it's having been carelessly read"?  also, what
evidence do you or did Shaw feel supports the notion that people are ignoring
Sianne's essay in the "group-manifesto" sense?  it seems obvious to me at
least that the essay, with an editorial thrust by jeff derksen, functions
exactly in this way.  now if you take the essay (which is part of a larger
piece/project i know little about--might be a dissertation) out of open letter
it would appear to me to to function a lot less in this traditional group
forming negativity sense.  and i suppose i would be more inclined to meet the
essay in this context.  i guess i see the group manifesto thing as played out.
not that groups aren't happening or that groups aren't primary to
"advancement" (i get by with a little help from my friends), but  i believe
once you start defining groups on paper with poems and essays then eventually
those definitions, which appear fixed in print, will come back to haunt you.
so that you get exclusion problems, who's in who's out problems, correct form
problems, race gender and class problems, people who think they're in one
group fighting against people who think they're in another group, etc. eg l-p
looks to be led by white prose-poetry writing poem-essay blurring hetero males
seeking out the academic sinecures of the mark strands of the world. i'm not
saying that's the case or even that it's an intelligent way to read the l-p
phenom.  but it can be read that way.  and we should keep in mind Dodie's good
point about revisionism re Shange.

i suppose it could be argued that i am just having some anxiety of
"appearance".  perhaps.  but all of the energy put into that group definition
could be keeping you from the next good poem.  so that the group project
initialized as l-p, at least as i read it being valorized in the recent open
letter, might actually hinder "advancement" (now). also i mean where is the
"advancement"?

to me it seems more important (now) to look for commonalities among different
groupings and try to create permeable groups, to seek out many to many
relationships.

Fellow Celebrators of Armand!

The Peoples Poetry Gathering  - and
organizers Poets House and Citylore - have added this
Banquet to the weekend events

Jeanine Klein (Armand's sister) and I, with input from
our collaborators, have been putting things together.
The Swedish cultural authorities have given Sten Hanson
a travel grant to come over and MC with me. Rumor has it
he will wear his tails and Royal Swedish honorary colors
conferred by the King of Sweden two years ago.
It is interesting to note that a former King of Sweden,
famous for his picture on a Swedish kronor bill,
is a ringer for Armand.

Please come to the Banquet for Armand Schwerner
Sunday, April 11, 7 pm
Teachers & Writers,
5 Union Square West, NYC

Armand Schwerner was a poet musician
compared in his recent NY Times obit
with Ezra Pound. He is most famous
for a series of poems called The Tablets
in which he creates Mesopotamian
"found tablets" with missing and untranslatable
lines and the comments of the scholar translator.
The Lving Theater created a critical success
with a staged version of The Tablets.

We all are chipping in 18$/person for
food and wine. Ellen Zweig and Jeanine Klein
have created a meal of Armand's favorite food
from the Moustache Restaurant. Wines have
chosen accordingly.

There will be toasts and performances by
Adam Schwerner, Jeanine Klein,
Jerome Rothenberg, Spencer Holst, Sten Hanson,
The Living Theater, Charles Bernstein,
Jackson Mac Low and Anne Tardos, Mike Heller,
Ellen Zweig, Francis Alenikoff, Pierre Joris,
Nicole Peyrafitte, Charlie Morrow, Phill Niblock (film),
Bernard Heidseick (recorded on phone), Logos Duo
of Belgium with a work based on the address in
Antworp where Armand was born. And more.

We have seatings for 70.
Please prepay reservations by
April 10 through Citylore,
phone 212 529-1955. No tickets sold at event.

Presented as part of the Peoples Poetry Gathering
by Poets House and Citylore in association
with Teachers and Writers Collaborative,

A SPECIAL ISSUE: THE BIOPIC


        The January 2000 issue of _Biography: An Interdisciplinary
Quarterly_ will explore the biopic.

        Guest editor Glenn Man is looking for papers which address the
theoretical, generic, historical, cultural, or technical aspects of
representing or telling lives in film or video--from Hollywood
spectaculars to indie films, from short subjects to A & E Biographies.
Interdisciplinary and multicultural approaches are particularly welcome.

        Manuscripts should be between 2,500 and 7,500 words, though
shorter and longer essays will be considered. Please submit two copies of
any manuscript. Since _Biography_ has a double-blind submission policy,
the author's name should not appear anywhere on either copy, but in the
cover letter. Decisions about publication will be received within three
months, and comments will be provided for all essays received.
Consultation on manuscript ideas is welcomed. For more information,
contact the general editor, Craig Howes, by email at biograph@hawaii.edu
by telephone at (808) 956-3774 by fax at (808) 956-3774 or by mail at the
Center for Biographical Research, University of Hawai'i, Honolulu, Hawai'i
96822.

DEADLINE for submissions: August 1, 1999.

SNAPSHOT

The impulse is everything
They did not expect to be next to each other
Now they are about to fall over each other
and see not them that cannot be 'seen'
other things also so try to show those other
to say it would be not to slide off it
being said, find ways to sacrifice it
to the elsewhere in us     Not to tell (you)
for you or for me     The action of thunder
noticed but not thought about, is
"The Wrestling God's WCW Thunder Report":  "Hey anonymous,
I hope you don't believe that windbag crap you are trying to tell
people" (The Turnstile Scroll)(or Delphic Oracle?)
What I write (note) I don't (try not to) notice.
We are what interferes with us
and that rough-handling and penetration
is the lived moment, that there are paths
to be followed like responsibilities
Thought is what floods us and wants to be written
and what was interfered with was not an aim
or narration to build a wall around itself
and form its own kingdom (as an oyster
makes a pearl of the interfering sand)
making myself available to the barrage
energy and reflection upon what was just 'here'
only 'there' for the moment of its performance
that memory (selective, judgmental, etc.) immediately
what need does it answer?  Spaces emerge,
and a new mutant species tries to inhabit them
Why both talk about what you are talking about?
You are never tallking about what you are talking about
I don't want to kill what I really want to talk about
neurons project me against the strength of incoming stimuli,
force me to new efforts of will and intervention
and if we respond it is as an 'error' of responding
to what we PROJECT . . . offending as a way
to respond to what is present
try to anticipate the next stage
see the entire web-of-associations
make that statement and do that thing
if the audience is being delighted by what
they already know is delightful
the rallying cry must not be
the game (move and countermove) of Western art
write the PROTECTION against noticing, PROTECT us
what can we include in the on-going
heretofore devalued and kept out, etc., etc.
web intersections, web of relatedness of all
find exhiliration and freedom and creative
ever-alike relation to your own web
you are no longer blind and hypnotized
you are a free man in all moments of your life
make contact with the reality that is really-there
not a new "that knocks me out like . . . "
(Shakespeare, sex, etc.) convinced of the reality
of one's own seeing when we are awed
or moved by the other, an alien other
in whom we wish we could partake (Hart's romantic art)
interacting the mind forgets its own workings
and there is no real meeting, only face to another
moment of "artificial" "something" that is mindless
too one dimensional to be a real encounter

NOISES by Serge Segay and Bob Cobbing ISBN 0 86162 866 7 - "collaborative

They're quite different poets. Segay collages disparate material, slams it
together and leaves it there, jarring to some extent and uses certain bits
and pieces over and again - his rubber stamp "Made in Zaumland" appears here

I think Cobbing has had the last say here. The elements of the page meld
together - but he too has utilised some heterogeneous bits and pieces to get
to where he is - I recognise the phrase "plummets towards a worm hole" from
cris cheek's talk on Domestic Ambient Noise at the last sv colloquium... & I
have just noticed "poetics of domestic noise"... sounds familiar (no pun
intended)

Might someone on the list have suggestions for reasonably priced lodgings
in the Pitts downtown?  I'm off to a conf in April and the conf hotel is
outrageously priced.  Please backchannel any suggestions.

the above is quoted from a post by James Perez.

I don't think poetry is *for* anything.

Adorno would say it reveals near-unbareable tensions and tears in the
social/historical fabric, which exists "in" society but also permeates
down into our subjectivities;  Marcuse would say it points forward to the
full realization, as an apprehendable utopia, of human possibility...

(the latter being ideas he probably partly takes from E. Bloch)

I think they're both *right*  (in a partial way);  but niether of these
defines what poetry is *for*  .... These are things it *does*

It's a basic defining human activity, and it makes at least as much sense
to say that *we* exist in order to do it, as it does to fall into the
delusion thinking that it "exists for something."  It is not apprehendable
in terms of function.  It ain't a functional thing.  (..it is more an
activity than a thing, in fact, but that's another post...)

Laura,

Thanks for clarifying this and many good points.

When Cecil Giscombe gave his wonderful talk about race and nature at Small
Press Traffic a couple of weeks ago, to which only TWO people came (thank
you Lee Ann Brown and Renee Gladman) he said some insightful things about
class during the question and period.  He'd spoken during the talk more
than once about being middle class--but also pointedly about living along
the margins.  I asked him to clarify that.  The margin point was, he said,
about writing and the realm of experimentation.  He then talked about how
the ability to play in the margins at ease (and I'm heavily paraphrasing
here and probably getting it all wrong) is a function of class.  He talked
about the students in his classes, how working class students, both black
and white, behaved with more of a hesitancy than middle class students.
That playing in the margins when you're middle class, you're not risking
everything, your whole being--that you have more of a support system to
fall back on.  Personally, I don't think those kind of dynamics ever
totally get erased--regardless of who's publishing who, who works at what
job.

The--everybody complains about "experimental" and "avant-garde"--why don't
we just call it "arty"--arty poetry world defines itself as white middle
class, and while there are serious and gratuitous attempts to expand that,
people from other backgrounds are always within an outsider group that's
playing against the white middle class center.  How many pomo theory books
have to be written before it's taken to heart--that nothing's really going
to change until that center is redefined.

Subject:      shifts in modalities
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

linda,

i want to pick up on yr lead regarding cultural poetics as a diagnostic tool
for discerning shifts in modalities in/or language environments.  i missed
nancy's buffalo talk but caught her reading (along with kevin davies and
deirdre kovac) in toronto -- write-up forthcoming.

i know nancy's current critical work engages with british cultural
materialism, leavis thru birmingham school -- very useful right now, as
perhaps such a return can yield new insights into where cult studs/poetics
might fruitfully be taken.  tho the term cultural poetics was popularized in
literary study by stephen greenblatt in the early-mid 1980s, who in turn
points to clifford geertz as inspiration, and who preferred the term in lieu
of "new historicism."

john guillory gave a talk here at western a few weeks ago, wherein he offered
a historical critique of cultural studies largely along the lines of what he
called its object of disciplinary desire.  basically: whether our critical
modality flattens everything into text (deconstruction as neo-high-formalism)
or cultural artifact (cult studs), there remains this ineluctable hermeneutic
residue as i call it, i.e. our task remains one of interpretation regardless
of what we call it.  i sort of dismally envisioned this limestone quarry
filled with critics pounding their heads against the wall of meaning hoping
that someone will simply notice them bleeding.  a heavy critique with,
unfortunately, little payoff: i asked guillory what we do with this
hermeneutic residue, and his suggestion was that cult studs shift its
modality away from the artifact itself and towards the mediation itself,
between the artefact and history, economics, politics, etc.  easy to assert,
hard to do no doubt.

point being: i think you and (or summarizing) nancy are on the right track,
and the way that different language environments mediate material conditions
is where we should be trying to look.  and i'm sympathetic to sianne's
efforts on this front to articulate a poetics of disgust.  i think the essay
is quite capable of being misread, but upon rereading it carefully i found
much more wrong with it than i originally had.  (save this for another time.)
suffice it to say that as a highly localized and provisional tactic/
environment, i think disgust is useful, but that we need at the same time to
identify a whole range of grammars: of abhorrence aversion loathing
repugnance repulsion revulsion.  and that unless disgust can start to help us
identify and articulate other modalities such as these, it remains
unabashedly singular, local, limited.  which is, of course, a good, and
perhaps the only, place to start.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

nancy shaw, kevin davies and deirdre kovac read from their work at
the redhead gallery (96 spadina ave, 8th fl) in toronto this past
thursday evening. they were introduced by peter jaeger, who
coordinated the event.  this was my first time hearing all of them,
though i was somewhat familiar with their work only through
peridoicals.  hot on the heels of nancy's and kevin's reading in
buffalo the previous night, and imbued with the sense of comraderie
found only through several hours of being on the road in the close
quarters of scott pound's ford fiesta, the three shared their
remarkable talents and personalities with us well into the next day.

nancy started off with portions of "flags," which can be found
interspersed throughout the other works found in jeff derksen's
recently-edited issue of open letter.  as she moved into other
sequences such as "torch songs" and "anthems" -- the latter of
which, i believe, nancy apologized for as being somewhat "didactic"
-- i found the nervous edge of nancy's delivery to persist: it was
curiously both compelling and faltering, as if caught up in its own
forward pace.  i found it distracting for a stretch but then found
myself becoming acclimated to this sort of arhythmia.  and by the
time nancy finished off with a set of new work, in which the
didactic had become more enmeshed in the more lyric mode of
"flags," the delivery's edge for me had become a perfectly engaging
counterpart to the text.

after a short break, kevin davies took the floor, calmly stacked
his loose sheets on the right side of the table, picked them up one
by one, read them and placed them face down in a pile on the left,
with next to no prefacing or commentary and only an intermittant
announcement of a sequence's title.  the humor that is so vital in
kevin's work was only reinforced by the deadpan earnestness of his
delivery.  at times he studied the page from which he was reading,
as if he too was puzzled or struck by what they contained, only to
return them to their proper pile with the others.  the energy in
the room was infectious, with each listener alternately giving in
to the sustained need to let out a guffaw or cackle.

another short break and deirdre kovac was introduced.  known to
listeners primarily as a co-editor of the journal big allis, her
work was largely unfamiliar to us, tho by the time she was finished
there was a clear need and desire to see and hear more.  deirdre
puts little inflection or emphasis into her delivery, and it really
doesn't need it because her words take on a music of their own.
her work has a marvelously complex texture of interweaving and
reoccuring sound patterns that moved near the threshhold of sense.
her vocabulary was exotic, even lush, and at times became atomized
and then recombined into a rich sonic wash.  the bulk of the texts
were from her manuscript called mannerism, which needs to find a
publisher at once.

special notice also should go to deirdre for maintaining utmost
poise after toronto luminary john barlow, upon arriving late and
trying to take a seat inconspicuously in the rear of the gallery,
ended up taking down with his backpack not one but two display
cases mounted to the wall and containing sculptures.  kevin had
presaged just such an occurance and felt remiss in not carrying
out some pre-emptive measures.  also in attendance were christian
bok, stephen cain, karen mac cormack, steve mccaffery, jenifer
papparro, andrew patterson, scott pound, and darren wershler-henry.

post-reading festivities ensued at the cameron house on queen
street west and carried on well into thursday evening. on friday
morning we met for a leisurely brunch at the lakeview diner on
dundas and ossington.  this was followed by a visit to coach house
press, where darren gave a tour and offered merchandise.  scott
then loaned us his car and peter, christian, and nancy and i took
kevin and deirdre to the airport shuttle.  we had a few hours to
kill before nancy's train left, so peter took us on a whirlwind tour
of some other toronto galleries, including the 401 richmond complex,
mercer union, and art metropole (the best place for artists' books
this side of printed matter in soho).

as peter departs for a trip to england shortly, we look forward to
the renewal of the redhead gallery reading series, to which we hope
that broken sculptures do not form an insurmountable deterrant.

I like to think that the question of class in writing has to do with the
argument of the writing, not the place where the writer of the writing was
born.

That is to say, my favourite working class writer from the US was and is
Douglas Woolf, but you know, his parents were pretty comfortable in the NE.
And Doug wrote about the west, mainly, too. So I would not call him a
middle class NE writer.

Grant Jenkins here.  Even though I am a habitual lurker, I'd like to weigh
in on the class discussion by responding to Mark Prejsnar's post.

I think this interrelation that Mark talks about between the personal and
the political is very important, especially with Susan Howe.   One simply
has to read her statements on poetics or her introduction to _The Europe of
Trusts_ to see how she views the relationship of her self/poetry to history.

But, as others have already suggested on this list, there's an aspect of
class, economics that is beyond the author's intentions.  This goes for
both activism and autobiography.  Class pressures and situations condition
every aspect of a writer as well as his or her relationship to culture,
community, and history.  Howe's upper-middle class upbringing in the
household of a Harvard University professor as well as her marriage to a
famous sculptor--just to name 2 of many many factors--provided her with
many economic/social opportunities (and problems) that she does not
incorporate consciously into her work.

Furthermore, there is no necessary or predetermined relation between class
and poetic production.  The meaning of those pressures and how they shape a
life/work is a matter of careful study and analysis of particular
situations.

I just think the intent angle in this discussion needs to be discussed
further.  And while were at it, perhaps we could get some definitions of
"class," as someone else suggested.

Why? This sets off my utopia-alarm. Except that I like venn diagrams too,
and though I find I only understand new meanings when they overlap somewhere
with what I already know or think about, I only go crazy for things that are
completely different -- other other. Permeable group sounds like open to
attack. Many to many sounds like Earl Gray which is to say the not my cup. I
don't go to school so my reading is only two eyes, unsanctioned, and
therefore independent but also subject to demands of time and motivation.
What seems important to me now is not even that looking for commonalities
but making the work, putting mine and others' work together for like or
unlike, moving the work around in front of other eyes (and the ears! but we
know that sense already), and being available to (being tolerant of!!
without risking too much of the mental health) the unknown.

Whatsay?

here's a really crude class distinction, which i offer w/o apology:

there's nothing i do re which money doesn't matter...

i know it's horrible to admit to this---but

the best way to get me going is to start talking about how you needed to do
this, so you did it... and how you needed to do that, so you did it... and
even, you needed to do this and that, and so you hunted out the best
buy---and it was all so very difficult...

b/c in the end, for me, if you keep talking about what you needed to do and
ultimately did, why then you still up and did it...

how's about we talk about what YOU COULDN'T DO... you just couldn't do...
b/c you didn't have the cash and.or couldn't afford the credit... or b/c
you couldn't leave your family behind, say...

i can recall a truly aggravating conversation i had once with someone who
kept insisting that i shoulda spent a semester abroad as an undergrad... i
kept saying "but i couldn't" and s/he kept saying "but you should have"...
of course here s/he was, standing in his/her parents' half-a-million dollar
house, so advising, and feeling entitled to advise... and here i was,
tongue-tied b/c i didn't feel like explaining the niceties of food stamps
in those quarters, in these times...

so whilst i live these days, strictly speaking, in middle-class trappings,
with upper-middle-class aspirations, i often worry and certainly react,
strictly speaking, along working-class (or worse) coordinates (though it's
fair to say i'm used to worrying and reacting so, so you *might* not
notice)...

no, i don't think you need to hail from poverty to write meaningfully about
poverty... it helps of course---but it's not a necessary or sufficient
condition... at the same time, i DO think (e.g.) there are tons o artifacts
out there that provoke in me an immediate class reaction, to the extent
that i know (or think i know) that the creator(s) either didn't give a hoot
about class, or wished to sidestep.avoid it...

alla that said:  one of the initial obstructions to my immersion in more
avant-garde (or whatever) writing (for me) was its apparent failure to
respond to the immediacies of class i'd been confronted with for so many
years... i can imagine mself reacting differently---e.g., seeing it as an
*escape* from these more quotidian realities ... but it took me a long
while to get over my resistance (as if i'll ever entirely get over it) and
i still find appealing the sort of writing that works out of a rather raw
engagement with said experiences---*provided* i don't get the sense the
writer is copping a holier-than-___ stance and.or offering it all up as
utterly "real" and w/o any fictive intervention... i.e., provided the
writing encourages reading with brain intact (which latter is shorthand for
all sortsa specifically textual practices that, or so i would hope, bring
class/race/gender etc and their interrelations into focus)...

at the same time, owing to my white het male background i suppose (though
this is only part of the picture of course), i was likely in a somewhat
secure state, finally, to venture forth into less orthodox literary form...

all of which is to say that my experience as a teach accords very much with
cecil g's (wish i coulda been in san fran to hear his talk,
dammitall!---though i chewed over some of these issues with him here in
chicago prior)... i have, i must add, also run into plenty of students who
are not from the working classes, who have been educated (extremely
thoroughly) to regard any but more orthodox writing much as they have been
educated to regard the 60s... i.e., as an example of mere cultural
self-indulgence and hypocrisy... this is as i see it a republican.centrist
sentiment that seems to have successfully seeped through much of higher
learning...

i would just want to be sure that we don't lay the burden of the
class.aesthetic conjunction solely on the shoulders of the lower classes...

best,

joe

Mark,

I think poetry is _for_ _love_;that it is the fundamental science of
emotional-epistemic investigation; & that it has more to do with questions
than answers.

Don, There was a renga for Ginsberg after his death.  Is that what you're
thinking of?  It was in the Fall of 97 (?), I think.  Shouldn't it be
archived in the Buffalo website?

Here's an AP story that may be of interest to the group.


U.S. Academy of Poets Diversifies

By BETH J. HARPAZ

.c The Associated Press

NEW YORK (AP) -- All it took to shake up the Academy of American Poets were a
few harsh words.

A year after it was criticized by two of its own as a bastion of white male
elitism, the academy's board of chancellors is adding nine new members -- five
of them female, two of them black and several of them known for their
experimental styles.

``What we've set out to accomplish is to make this group more representative
of the breadth and spectrum of poetry in America today,'' executive director
Bill Wadsworth said Monday.

``The creaky rusty sound you're hearing now -- that's the gates of the academy
of the future slowly opening,'' said Bob Holman, co-producer of the PBS series
``The United States of Poetry.''

Last fall, chancellors Carolyn Kizer and Maxine Kumin resigned to protest the
board's lack of diversity. Wadsworth said their resignations and other
criticisms prompted the changes.

The new members are Lucille Clifton, Robert Creeley, Louise Gluck, Yusef
Komunyakaa, Heather McHugh, Michael Palmer, Adrienne Rich, Rosanna Warren and
Charles Wright.

Ms. Clifton and Komunyakaa are black. Creeley and Palmer write in experimental
styles.

Ms. Clifton was pleased at the diversity of the new board. ``It's lots of
patches in a quilt -- all of them part of the American quilt,'' she said.

The new chancellors join John Ashbery, Jorie Graham, John Hollander, Richard
Howard, Donald Justice, J.D. McClatchy, W.S. Merwin, Mark Strand and David
Wagoner. All of them are white; Ms. Graham is the only woman.

``I'm delighted at the reorganization and I think it was worth all we went
through in resigning, which was rather painful, although we had dozens of
letters in support from all over the country, which was gratifying,'' said Ms.
Kizer, who lives in Sonoma, Calif. ``The new group includes a couple of
African-Americans who are distinguished poets, and that's a big step
forward.''

Joseph Parisi, editor of Poetry magazine in Chicago, said: ``These are all
people of great accomplishment. ... The reconstituted chancellorship is more
representative of what's going on now.''

Books that I want reviewed include:  M. Davidson's ARCADE, M. Bellen's TALES
OF MURASAKI, L. Browns THE AGENCY OF WIND, the forthcoming Italian anthology
by Sun & Moon Press, Carl Martin's GENII OVER SALZBURG, and the
Hejinian/Scalapino collaboration SIGHT. Laura Moriarty's THE CASE, and Joan
Retallack's HOW TO DO THINGS WITH WORDS.... ... .(A VERY PARTIAL LIST).

For translations, I'm sort of more interested in South Americans and Italians

"Furthermore, there is no necessary or predetermined relation between class
and poetic production.  The meaning of those pressures and how they shape a
life/work is a matter of careful study and analysis of particular
situations."

I just wanted to interject at this point how important I think it is to mark
this distinction, which Grant Jenkins brings up, clearly, because I think
any discussion of "classing" poetry and the production of poetries teeters
at the brink of overdetermining this relationship, which I think certainly
exists. The question is relational, not absolute-- and there are some
classifications that pass for "class" in the interpretation of poetry that I
would resist-- the hack Marxism that equates "difficult" with "bourgeois."
The conditions of literary production are more interesting than gathering up
the 1040's of American poets and making a list for the modern state.  It is
also a distinction that produces meaning on the reader's side of things.
Tentatively, I would venture that it may not be an intention in writing, but
a condition, or perhaps more productive to caste it so. It is a concern one
can foreground and trace through the reading of a text, or an author's work,
or so on. And it is always there. And I think when one reads with these
concerns one takes an aesthetic to its most radical limit and asks how it
relates to that other of itself, the real (whatever that might be) that the
words are pointing towards or perhaps pointing in. And I would further
venture that there is an overwhelming tendency (perhaps an Academic tendency
(and I don't think "Academic" is a bad word, I even like some of them)) to
look at literary movements as solely aesthetic resolutions, conflicts,
reconciliations-- working outside of, or having an alterity to, the
activities of the historically happening world of existence. I don't think
either need cancel the other out, but  establish an economy of reading which
for me means introducing ethics into the discussion of the poetical, and
specifically I'm thinking here that maybe Pound is the test for the this
kind of reading or maybe even better, Dickinson. I'm just going to stop
right here. Peter

or is it uncertain?  I'm not so sure one understands one's poetics as much
as one keeps them on as active and productive uncertainties.  page mother
kathleen fraser provides instruction in this area, in her letter to Andrea
in her poem "Five letters from one window, San Gimignano, May 1981), which
is available on her author page at the EPC.  she writes: "one might
sometimes think I was returning to the style of work i did twenty years ago
. . . still i am just as uncertain and resistant, at the beginning of each
work attempted, as I ever was . . . I'm trying to find a way to include
these states of uncertainty"

So are 'we' at once in the shadow the shadow of uncertainty and
overdetermination?  Probably just being good little feminists if we are.
which reminds me,  ally mcbeal, a cultural worker?  because she gets away
with wearing a goofy sock hat?  she _still_ makes me feel inadequate.

>What was R Wolff's manifesto?

she posted it here a while back.  I don't remember what the subject line
was.  it was in relation to the journal she edits.  (and to which I
partially respond to in a post i am writing in my response to joel's
response to page mothers, which i am working on, and rewriting, so it
doesn't sound too much like a manifesto)

You need only take a look at the dismal thing that is the lowgrade grad
seminar at the middle-ground state university in which, say, a bunch of
middle class folks who "love books" or in this case "love poetry" and want
to write papers about it and teach it are being agonizingly weaned by a
well-trained, frustrated professorial practitioner who got her pHd,
needless to say, somewhere entirely else, away from the practice of looking
for "what it means" and toward the practice of coming up with salient
materialistic points for their inevitably crappy papers to know why this
particular shift will be the death of all joy in poetry. I have no doubt
that it will happen, and it will suck.

This [the posting about S. Howe's particularities] is exactly what I was
talking about earlier when I said that "it [the shift into  classrooms
producing critics whose facilities are lamed] will happen and it will
suck." I do not want to know what Susan Howe's family home was like and I
do not want to know what her husband does for a living. Cultural studies is
simple biographical criticism in thin disguise: an excuse for
sensationalism and for those who are uncomfortable with ambiguity to write
about where their subject was born and how many doctors were around the
table, color of baby blanket, etc.

Dear Standard:

I was surprised by Martin's book as well. Growing up in Winston-Salem,
North Carolina, he was a regular at poetry and music events; I remember him
giving some readings in the early 1980s. I assume that he still lives
there. I don't think he works (though I'm not sure of this), and if
information doesn't have him listed, you might try contacting him care of
the English Department at Wake Forest University (I believe that he has
taught some classes through them).

All the best,
Devin Johnston

Well, I guess I should come to my own defense--if I am able, being only a
lame, lowgrade academic.

All snideness aside, I have a question for you, Rebecca: what exactly then
do you think is the "joy of poetry"?

What I can gather from reading the texts of Susan Howe--letters, poems,
journals, marginalia--that it is precisely the textual particulars of
another that she finds to be the "joy of poetry."  Reading Melville's
Marginalia, a colletion of his notations in books he was reading, inspired
her to write a poem that exposes the irony, uncertainty, and change in not
only Melville's "life" but also in history (another text).  Immersing
herself in the manuscripts of Emily Dickinson, Howe reclaims and
reconsiders Dickinson in a feminist context. I read much joy, Susan's and
mine, in both of those works.  The joy comes not just from the work but
that it was written, by someone.

This is not biographical criticism because it does not distinguish between
a "text" and a "life." Both are in language yet bear the traces of another
person who chose to write.  Nor is this mere cultural criticism, as you
would have it.  It's what Peter Neufeld in his post refered to as an ethics
that calls for a consideration of the uncertainty and alterity that mark
our reading of an other's texts.  There is more at stake than just figuring
out "what it means."  Anyway, I don't know to many academics who have this
goal.  (Isn't so much of the poetry that we all enjoy and feel invested in
marked by a blur between poetry and criticism?  Must we draw that line in
the sand again?  Why?)

For me, the joy of poetry comes not just from New Critically reading (or
writing) the Genius of a poem, In Itself.  But from following the textual
threads out of the work and into other texts and other uncertainties, ad
infinitum.  Not knowing "what it means" is the greatest joy.

I don't really se 'group project'.  I see people talking about things, and
those things materializing in the small press.  What's interesting is what
serves to 'group' these people.  location?  politics?  aesthetics? this
list?  gender?

I disagree with your description of Language groups as "led by white
prose-poetry writing poem-essay blurring hetero males seeking out the
academic sinecures of the mark strands of the world."  Duplessis, Hejinian,
Howe, Scalapino, and Fraser have all written essays and some even books, or
have in some other way, as teachers or as editors, assumed leadership
positions.  But I see your response as evidence of the problem implicit in
the gender dynamics of the small press.  More men edit, more men publish,
thus more men control the means through which poetries and ideas are
materialized, and so there are more men leaving a 'paper trail' -- those
cultural artefacts that we so love.  A second 'problem' -- these women are
probably partly obscured by their 'dual' concern with feminism and poetics.
Poetry is as much about having a gender as not, yet women, as other, have
assume the responsibility of addressing this issue.

I don't see a lang-po group -- the connections are made variously.  But they
can only be grouped on the basis of some particularity of their engagement
and not generally.

Its this sort of insistence, I hear from Eliz. Treadwell and Rachel Daley
and others recently on this list, the insistence on a group (generation as a
group) to emerge that 'blinds' one to the groups that are emerging.  part of
Nancy's talk, which doesn't bear thru in an account of her reading of Ngai
only, is the issue of shifting modalities, and the recognition of those as
such.
> to me it seems more important (now) to look for commonalities among
different
> groupings and try to create permeable groups, to seek out many to many

I would tend to agree but then your terms are so general here that I'm not
sure what I'd be agreeing with. What do you mean by grouping -- a sort of
self-selection?  or that of the taxonomist?  We can't first look for
commonalities without first deigning to articulate them, no?  But these
writings would then be your "ghosts"?  How does one proceed?

hi tom.

I agree with you on some problems in Ngai's argument.  As a diagnostic a
poetics of disgust does help identity a particular grammar ("raw matter").
but i'm not sure there's much cultural work being done in that.  it's
culturally aware in that it views the poetics as a response to culture.
Ngai would like to push that into an area where it will do actual
ideological batle with democratic pluralism which would exclude disgust as a
reaction.  On the other hand, she want to argue that 'raw matter' doesn't
'mean' but 'be's' (with a nod to mark Presjnar's recent post) but i'm not
sure this isn't so much more of the 'subversiveness' which she tries to
separate it from.  I'm not sure, but I think by 'subversiveness' she means
that which is merely textual?  Or a position assumed as a reaction that
isn't really effective?  As 'material' as such a poetics is (@%$#!! and []
being some of its more material gestures, those that 'be') it's still only
language, still implicit in language as a referential system (she wants to
say we 'turn away' from those gestures [as in disgust] but maybe we just
step over them so to speak?), and still not bodies thrown in the line of
fire so to speak.  She brings up a useful warning against the idea of
'eclecticism' however which would obscure the sort of taxonomies that both
you tom and Bill luoma seem to desire. Again it's with reference to this
concept that she tries to push a POD in the direction of the political, but
in the end it still seems like an analogy to me.

Al Sharpton vowed arrests everyday until the four officers are indicted
for the Amadou Diallo killing.

He has made good on his promise--a prolongued strategy which has allowed
other slower moving groups to join this campaign challenging Police
Brutishness.

I have heard from activists that these arrests, at 12 noon at Police
Plaza have been very calm and non-eventful (all walking, no resisting)
and the consequences have been a mere Desk Appearance Ticket, most of
which end up being dismissed, and that notables and non notables have
been treated alike.  I am wondering, if there would be folks out there
willing to partake in this symbolic arrest, some time next week, date to
be determined.

Of course at any time these events can be cancelled, especially if the
officers are indicted,which they may be next week.

Backchannel if you are interested.  No polemics on Sharpton please.

thanks,
Rachel

5.
The rudeness by which a student will stand up
and come, during class discussion, to my desk
to ask a question about homework tops
my list of the insensitive and pesky
behaviors that betoken fear... of what
but success, progress, learning as a nut
rust-locked to threads it cannot climb or fall
but sits becoming one with its bolt in
a rotting way that spreads, infecting all
the process with its broad assumption
that learning is the province of some race
or class or caste or code or outward grace
and not the democratic saving spot
of shine where rust flakes off without a trace.

6.
What the administrator doesn't know
is that our students, people who're on jobs
closer to war than she will ever go,
need not the pose of friendship, sweetened so
it patronizes, but not to be robbed
of their time and strength in such short supply
that just getting to class is winning one
of a few battles in the whole long day
with odds as good as crooked books would lay
on fights of men with pens with men with guns.

The fallacy is sharper than the sword
when bureaucrats play numbers with the need
of people whom momentum forces toward
an end that rescues or an end that bleeds.

13.
A test, like toilets, functions in a stall
designed to catch and conduit the work
of thought and body, and raise animal
maneuvers to the status of elite
and esoteric dance-steps: fighters' tricks
taught to a handful of combative feet
and practiced against bound bundles of sticks
on petaled mountainsides that early spring
when gray thaw water loosened under crusts
of twig-enciphered ice that, cracking, sings
down breezes that unbend bodies of grass
against all gravity.  Their gestures dust
heaven with autumn's water to amass
cumulus continensts that pass the test.

27.
A confrontation at a meeting starts
a chain of phonecalls, more meetings, advice
on how, without offending, to impart
our distress at our new bosses' attacks
on how we teach and whom, at more-than-twice-
posed questions answered only with fog, stacked
decks of stock response and blood-ugly lies
that what we teach is not about the tests
our students must pass to, in their own eyes,
be whole and ready to pursue courses
out of dying jobs, wield instruments against
breathed roach-dust that stops breath or the fell force
of race hate that buys Giuliani's votes
and police batons across their children's throats.

28.
Off to meet with a new class, my ennui
becomes a headwind against which I tack
and, in the face of each resistance, lose
the slightest will to move, until money
asserts its primacy and sends me out
to test the classroom weather, and there tout
learning as something that deserves desire,
as if where it has brought and left me proves
it worth calories to make bodies move
against such wind's enmity, through such fires
as blow and burn between ourselves and it --
as if, besides this paper's freight of scrawl
that moves me line by line from world to wall
it bespoke lore that found love, or paid debts.

Here and There


Here is the negative.  Over there where you are.
Here?  Yes, sir.  That is the way you saw it?
Yes, that is the way you saw it.  That is not the picture
they taken the date that parked pop truck was here.
Before it goes into the, into the furnace.
Always something in the factory or something like that.
Somewhere around there.  If you wanted to check it out,
you could check it out, if not you didn't have to.

Hold it a minute.  I think over here, about there.
Coming out there, come right here.
Come right on back here, right there,
about right in here, and like this pulls out of here
over there.  Do you have a picture?
There is no picture.  The police taken pictures.
Yes, ma'am.  Pull around from here to there.
Yes, ma'am.  "Here" and "there" is a curtain place.
Pull around there about from here to that chair,
and it stayed there, about down to the back of the chair,
back here.  The chair in the last row?  Yes,
the back row of chairs from where you are to the back row.

You are as far from where you were to what period of time
did you work at Winn-Dixie.
Do you remember when a man come out to talk to you,
and there was a red-haired young lady making some notes?
She was writing down the things being said.
I was out there.  I was already out there.
And then my boss said, "What the hell, he wasn't even out there."
No, I was already out there.
After he left, he talked to me.
After they got done calling me.

The guy said he was hollering the way he was going on there.
I told him a lot more than that.
You all in here, somewhere around there.
She knew the ropes, things like that.
She was like trying to train me.
It wasn't like I didn't pay no attention.
What they had trained me for was a mold instrumentor.
And then they said it and it got bigger and popular.
Admonitions.  Go out there hollering.
It is putting platinum wire on a jet propeller.


P.S.  Dear Henry, last Saturday Miguel Rubio
was writing a parapgraph for me and wrote down this word
--pressing pen hard on to page, like he was carving it--
e x s p e c i a l i l y, which brought to mind my own
e x s p e s s h a l l y, spoken 22 years ago this April
in a community college in Plantation, Florida (my hometown).
"Get rid of that X."  "It sounds ignorant."
On the table were letters of recommendation
(her idea, not mine) to Vanderbilt, Princeton and Yale
(I made it as far north as New Orleans--for a year).
Why is educated english so afraid of the X?
That's how they said it in elizabethan england
according to my original spelling edition of shaxespear.
My students from the east side of Cleveland
come down hard on the X--chewing it, enjoying it,
refusing to give it up--and I never admonish them
(my Adorno:  "the poor chew words to fill their bellies")
so I would speak to your yearning for "black speech":
I listen for it listening and trying hard to relearn
the eloquent vernacular of the north american working class
that I readily sacrificed--buried, really--so severely
that when I walked into a room in Des Moines in 1987
to meet with agitators getting jobs in the slaughterhouses
their leader, whom I'd already met and spoken with,
whose own folks he'd said had been sharecroppers
in Mississippi, laughed out loud the brave heart's laugh
as soon as I opened my mouth.  "There," he said,
"didn't I tell you he had a British accent?"

It is called CLASS BETRAYAL, but that is not the right word.

See here:

A brooding intellect injected into the effusive lyricism of the New York
School makes Berrigan's famous parentage--he is the son of poets Ted Berri=
gan
and Alice Notley--an inheritance he self-awarely transforms. Berrigan is n=
ot
so much undoing intellectualism as trying to wear it lightly, and lyricize=
 it
in ways that may at first resemble the work of Ron Padgett, but comes clos=
er
to the more sublimated pleasures of John Ashbery: "Do I have to slip into =
a
box/ To prove my disinterest in watching my step?" Berrigan posits a kind =
of
detachment that can co-exist with a heavily marked social calendar ("the p=
hone
never rings I never get it when it does"), yet is wryly aware that as a po=
et
"you can get a medal for running in circles, that's integrity for you," an=
d
thus balances the sometime solemnity of art with a "dramatic life" that ca=
n
"instantly trivialize anything." At the tender age of 26, Berrigan is a ma=
ster
of the exuberant, and reading the book straight through can somewhat dimin=
ish
the quirky insights and intense subjectivity of the individual poems. Yet =
the
pathos of "8/1/97"; the slower, intimate, tenderness of "To what end is wh=
at
we got..."; and the formal quatrains that appear at the end of the sprawli=
ng
poem "Ghost Town"-"To be as strange as what/ The heart contains as method/=
 Of
departure it makes sense/ To shake when approaching"-evidence an impressiv=
e
tonal range. An exciting debut that taunts its own allure-"Catullus didn't=

I think it was David Bromige (sp?) who posted the Loyola readings listing;
thank you.  I enjoyed the reading.  Started a bit late:  the campus church
bells rang eight WAY before Willis and Gizzi started.

Also re:  the gender/class discussion.  I came across this Turing test site:
http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~psaygin/ttest.html

I had forgotten the test was a man, a woman, and a questioner...

Now if the questions were poems, or a corpse, then...

And if only male engineers (working class or professional?) construct the
machine...

Pressrelease
March 24th 1999

Help B92 and the independent media in Yugoslavia
Latest news at http://helpB92.xs4all.nl

Last night the transmitter of radio B92 from Belgrade was confiscated by
the Serbian authorities. The editor-in-chief, Veran Matic, was held in
custody in a police station for well over 8 hours. Despite this
intimidation the station continues its independent news service. At De
Balie in Amsterdam a support group has been founded tonight, which intends
to support B92 and other independent media in Yugoslavia where possible in
the continuation of these important news services.

With the support of internetprovider XS4ALL B92 also transmits its signals
via internet since december 1996. These digital broadcasts are picked up
by the BBC Worldservice and retransmitted via satellite. Through a network
of local radio stations the programs of B92 can be heard throughout
Serbia, despite repeated attempts by the authorities to silence the
station. At this moment it is still possible to follow the broadcasts of
Radio B92 in real audio on their website, at http://www.b92.net

In light of the current tense situation it is very likely that the
possibilities of B92 to continue its independent news service will be
limited even further. The support group therefore intends to take measures
to distribute news by and about B92 from Amsterdam. For that purpose a
special website has been opened at http://helpB92.xs4all.nl

B92 is the backbone of the independent news service in Yugoslavia. Without
immediate financial support this last source of independent news for the
inhabitants of this region is endangered. A fundraising campaign is being
started by the support group, in order to send money and equipment to B92
and other independent radio stations in Serbia and Kosovo as soon as
possible.

The founders of the support group are: B92, De Balie, De Digitale Stad,
Next 5 Minutes, Press Now, radioqualia (Australia), De Waag (MONM) en
XS4ALL.

The Postbank account for donations is 7676, made payable to Press Now in
Amsterdam, please specify "Help B92". For more information or to send
messages of support, please e-mail helpB92@xs4all.nl. You can also
digitally support this initiative by copying the special logo onto your
website and linking to Help B92.

My claim has nothing to do with whether or not we can imagine there being
no poetry.  I'm not interested in developing a highly generalized
anthropological theory.  Poetry is a basic defining activity because it is
one of the things (like music, baseball, juggling, physics, Monty Python)
wherein people stretch out from what has been, into some dynamic and
interesting thing-that-wasn't-there-before ("thing" meaning in this case
as much an active involvement as a material object...)

And such stretching seems to me definitive of what is most interesting
about us.

It is precisely because we can imagine humans without poetry, that poetry
becomes exciting, and worthwhile...

No doubt my "basic defining activity" phrase was in some ways not the best
for saying what i meant....But i was (and still am) trying to stress
primarily the fact that poetry (and all similar art-activities) are things
we do 'cause they are more enriching and more fun than...well, than not
doing them.  They should not be seen in functionalist terms and do not
have a purpose.

Subject:      Ray Johnson Review
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Thrill compels me again to say a little of what i've recently seen. A
retrospective of the collagist and mail artist Ray Johnson closed last
Sunday at the Whitney Museum, and i could cry like a toddler to make it
come back and stay a little longer. Three and a half hours of a Thursday
afternoon in those marvelous rooms wasn't nearly enough time in Ray
Johnson's filial company.

        The only things of his that i'd seen before this exhibit were a few
items in the Jargon archive at the Poetry Collection in Buffalo, and the
Black Mountain College Dossier series book #4 that came out a couple of
years ago. This exhibit, then, gave me a bigger window to press my nose
to: forty-five-odd years' worth of window, arranged chronologically (the
exhibitors admitted that they'd set it up by time despite Ray Johnson's
distrust of chronology, not to mention his antagonism towards museum
exhibitions themselves. Still, hearkening back to an earlier List
discussion over the value of archiving the avant-garde, the Ray Johnson
exhibit was an example of such value to those artists/poets who,  had it
not been saved and later presented,would not have gotten to see the work
at all. Moreover, it was a way to absorb at least some of the scope and
continuity of Johnson's lifelong activity).

        The exhibit began with some early paintings and collages; then, in the
second room, it introduced Johnson's invention of the "moticos"  (an
anagram of the word"osmotic"). Like Schwitters's "merz" and
Rauschenberg's "combine," Johnson's "moticos" is his term for his
collage/assemblage work at that time (beginning sometime in the
fifties). I was confused by the exhibit's description of what makes a
moticos a moticos -- it seemed to have to do with a moticos being made
of multiple kinds of material, including photographs, various kinds of
paper, inks and washes, etc., but the collaging itself was clear: here
was the beginning of a long and involved project of literal building and
wordplay. Moving into the late 50s and into the 60s, the collages get
chunky 3-d, with stacks of cardboard "tesserae" (a critic's term for
Johnson's mosaic-like sanded, painted, and/or buffed blocks) abounding
-- O, man after my own corrugated cardboard heart! oh joy! In "let it
all hang out," the tesserae fell loosely into a pile towards the bottom
of the piece. . .  Lovely chaos!

        It went on endlessly. There were portrait collages, which he created by
drawing a subject's silhoutte and then making and re-making series of
collages out of it, sometimes referring to different people than the
ones he was supposedly portraying (it put me in mind of Gertrude Stein,
of whom Johnson was a fan). In an accompanying videotaped interview with
one of the portrait subjects, one man describes how Johnson came back,
after tracing the man's silhouette,  with 26 different resulting
collages! Then,  over the months that they were negotiating a selling
price,  Johnson  mixed and matched and otherwise re-made several of the
portraits.

        There was a series of mail art made from Lucky Strike cigarette labels
(happy sigh).

        There was a "potato masher" series  in one of the last rooms,  lauding
various people's mothers.

        There was ephemera and mail art in glass tables throughout the exhibit.
It was engrossing, and there was too little of it. There were documents
from Johnson's New York Correspondance [sic] School, some of which
described meeting activity and what everyone was wearing. There were
homemade collage books. There was a letter from Joan Crawford thanking
him for his fanmail. This little paragraph can't begin to cover it.


        So many things for which i feel affinity. . . my personal faves then.
First,  affinity for his motifs:

Gertrude Stein, esp. when her head was inserted in the dollar bill where
george washington normally is.

His wordplay, esp. in the series play on the word "ice" (both the Black
Mountain book and the exhibit point out his preoccupation with the
solid-liquid-gas states of changeable water), which became "lice" and
"ire,"  of all things.

His use of the Jantzen swimming suit diver on a "zen" postcard.

 A tuna fish label.

Marianne Moore.  There was a series of collages based on her tri-corner
hat.
Also, there was another, earlier collage (reproduced in the Black
Mountain College Dossier book) of her hat, with a big, open,
diagrammatic mouth underneath, covering what would be her face.


Secondly, then, affinity for his methods:

Personal correspondence. His work is from one person to one other, often
back and forth. The puns, jokes, context, and content have to do with
the person to whom he is giving the collage. Such is the tender beauty
of mail art and it's publicly intimate distribution system, the postal
service.

Collaboration.  Goes with the above. There was one piece in particular
that was striking. A friend of his acquired multiple reproduction copies
of the mona lisa. He sent one to Johnson. Sometime later, Johnson sent
it back with a sort of rope coil on the face, as a play on something
that was said or drawn (i can't remember which) in their accompanying
letters.

Word-play.   And not just of conventional words, as in the "ice"
collages. Early on, Johnson drew and filled in glyphs from the contours
of his individual moticos, which then made their way into later, further
collages.

Continuation. His pieces are ongoing conversations. A pun or a theme
moves through several incarnations. He destroys one collage (his own or
that of a correspondent) to make another, and so on. The pieces aren't
discrete.

Stacked cardboard. When i saw layers of cardboard glued together to get
various depths, i jumped and scurried for joy. i read that he often used
sandpaper to polish it and couldnt wait to get home and try it. i peered
under the top layers, stared at the white paint coating each precarious
column    laughed   and  crammed my noggin with as much learning from
his imagination as i could carry.


        There was an engrossing video interview with Ray Johnson looping in one
of the exhibition rooms. He had the most alluring, active pair of hands
i've seen on an ostensibly non-lesbian person (he was gay). He kept
gesturing about how he worked. He was wearing a pullover sweater. i
wanted to hug him.

I may be white, male, and of working class background.  I still am a
'working' person and did put myself through a middle-ground state
university by working my way through it.  I attended some of the classes
mentioned and wrote my share of crappy papers.  I did eventually switch
majors and depart from the scene referred to but I prefer to think it
was because of my perceptiion of the basically hypocritical and
political atmosphere of literature and writing programs (this was thirty
years ago so no one here need take offens).  I find the comments below
offensive to me, my children, and their teachers, among others.

So according to the AP and/or the AAP, Creeley writes in "an experimental
style."

I humbly submit that this underlines the truth i keep boring everyone
with, to wit, the E word, and all its allied forms (the A compound word,
the I word) are worse than useless.  There is good, or interesting poetry,
as i call it.  And then there's the AAP.

And if at this late date they're still fretting about RC, things are even
sadder than we suspected..

I close with a difficult quote from the experimental voice-poet elvis
mcmanus II:  i used to be disgusted, now i try to be amused.

The whole class issue is a complex one, and at the very least, warrants
more attention and critical thought.

I don't think I believe that issues like class and gender "naturally"
find their way into the work. There is a kind of erasure and the
silencing imposed by super structures and codes of all sorts--formal and
political, and so on that are at work beneath the surface. They erupt
and transfigure the surface, "cellular" structure, if you will.  It's
the active engagement with them that interests me. And I guess I think
that sometimes revolutions arise from the page.

Nothing is off limits.  There is nothing inherently reductive about
engaging with such issues on the page. I think of the work that Kathleen
Fraser did via HOW(ever) to articulate/explore a feminist poetics in
formally challenging work--very important for my own engagement.

I've found that some of the work of fellow feminist writers is "polite,"
operates with a certain decorum (I fight against this myself), that is
claustrophobic.  For me, there is a connection with class and gender and
sexuality issues here.  What I love about Dodie's Letters of Mina Harker
is that she slays all those sacred cows requiring decorum.  And I think
that the formal dynamics of the Mina Letters can be discussed in terms
of class.  In fact, the wheels are spinning right now on this topic.
Look out for an essay on this in the future.

Activity in Colleges, High Schools and Many Communities Builds Toward
Massive 'Millions for Mumia' Marches April 24 in Philadelphia and San
Francisco

Growing Movement Demands: 'Stop the Execution! End Police Brutality! A
New Trial for Mumia Abu-Jamal!'

On Sat. April 24, people from all walks of life will march on
Philadelphia and San Francisco as "Millions for Mumia," to stop the
execution of African American journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal. They will
demand a new trial for the death-row activist and add their voices to
the growing chorus calling for an end to racist police brutality.

The Millions for Mumia April 24 Mobilization has been endorsed by over
500 individuals and organizations, including Ossie Davis, Alice
Walker, Angela Davis, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, Rev.
Benjamin Chavis Muhammad, 1199 Health & Human Services Union/SEIU, Pam
Africa, Cornel West, Edward Asner, Barbara Smith, Leonard Weinglass,
Susan Sarandon, Bobby Seale, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Leslie Feinberg,
Noam Chomsky, Geronimo ji Jaga (Pratt), Kathleen Cleaver, Manning
Marable, Art Spiegelman and Ani DiFranco.

The immense level of activity in colleges, high schools and
communities throughout the United States is a clear sign that the
April 24 demonstrations will be among the largest in recent history,
and the biggest ever on behalf of a U.S. political prisoner.

In a March 19 call to action, Ossie Davis, Pam Africa, Ramsey Clark
and other leaders said: "Mumia Abu-Jamal is a former Black Panther and
a lifelong fighter against racism, repression and police brutality. He
is a widely published author and radio commentator. In 1981 Mumia was
framed for the murder of a white police officer in Philadelphia. All
the evidence, however, indicates that he is innocent.

"Mumia was sentenced to death. For the last 17 years he has been one
of the most well known political prisoners in the United States. His
last appeal to the State of Pennsylvania has been denied, despite the
fact that witnesses who had been intimidated by the police have now
come forward. He could be executed within six months."

They concluded: "The campaign to win a new trial for Mumia is more
than the struggle for justice for one person. It is part of an
emerging movement of community, student and youth activism that stands
in opposition not only to police brutality, but also the death
penalty, attacks on affirmative action, and the intensification of
racism, sexism, homophobia and repression."

       Communities, Students Mobilize Nationwide

Robin,

I think you are so right here--"lady" poetics I call it.  And it's not hard
to understand why many younger women don't want to associate with the whole
feminist thing.  Though, these days, luckily, there are many strong
counter-trends.  The feminist poetics scene in SF nourished me--but it
became clear fairly early on that I was not going to be supported there
(quite the opposite) for the sexuality and vulgarity I was moving towards.
(Though it wasn't as bad as when I recently read in Cambridge and nobody
would look me in the eye or talk to me after my reading.)  I had to go
outside the feminists to male writers in order to find a safe bubble where
I could develop my work, push it.  Of course there was always Kathy Acker
as an important model in the distance (for I didn't yet know her in the
early 80s) but she was so impossibly hip in her buzz haircut and miniskirts
and I was so impossibly not hip, there didn't seem much hope of a
connection there.  I'm greatful now to all the women that are my allies
(and the ladies who aren't maintain a silence of tolerance).  But it took a
long time before any women were supportive of my work. I'm still reading
feminist theory books (Rosi Braidotti is my new passion), and occasionally
a kind soul such as Susan Gevirtz will talk to me about them.

John Cage and the American Experimental Tradition
        by Christopher Shultis
                        [Northeastern U Press 1998]


                                                what cart?
                                                what horse?


the intro lays out the poles of the study after noting that the inquiry "is
governed by an assumption that an emphasis on process is a shared concern of
all artists commonly regarded as *experimental*" (p.xvi) Shultis goes on to
note that processes can be initiated in two ways

1) by a self controlling the process
2) by a self co-existing with process

next we are given 3 criteria against which to contrast those whose work fits
with option 1 and option 2 - these are their attitudes about Nature,
Symbolism, and the Unintentional

briefly

the <self which controls process> is outside of Nature, separate from it, is
IN the environment, seeks to know, use, etc // uses Symbolism in the same
way that it uses nature as a means to an end //  and is closed to the
unintentional

the 'self coexistent with process' is inside Nature, not separate, part OF
the environment // uses natural objects as themselves instead of as Symbolic
of other things // & is open to the Unintentional

ok

so far this is all intro - where CS lays out the presuppositions of the
study to follow - this is all enmeshed with a contrast between Emerson (who
will be aligned with Charles Ives, Charles Olson - Projectivists) and
Thoreau (Cage, Objectivists)
        part of what i like in all of this is that CS is very careful to
state that the poles of his comparison are in some sense hypothetical -
intentionally overdrawn - and that what he's interested in is the gray area
between them & how consideration of Cage is useful to charting this space
        Emerson and the Charles' Olson and Ives - via their 'projectivist'
stance (retro application warning) are in CS's view 'dualistic' - Thoreau,
the Objectivists and Cage are 'nondualistic'

i changed the heading of this post from "review" to "thoughts" b/c i find
that i'm basically in sympathy with the book - and as Shultis has been quite
careful in delineating just what he is making claims about and what he is
not i find it hard to do much more than agree with the main points of the
book within their chosen and carefully staked ground

those who have an investment in Emerson or Thoreau might have differences or
wish to debate terms but i have not these investments and so in addition to
recommending the book to anyone interested in Cage's poetics as well as to
Olsonites and fans of the Objectivists and others i'd like to ask some
questions about the 'gray area between the poles' that Shultis' study
highlights


if - as Cage said - his purpose was purposelessness or perhaps - that
nonintention was his intention then he does partake of both poles
        he intends not to intend
some i'm sure find this contradictory just as Shultis (and maybe Cage fans
generally) see it as breaking with the dualistic logic one finds in Emerson
but an insistence on nonduality

but i wonder

i think Cage probably wd have said something similar and affirmed in some
way what i hear Shultis affirming in his book

but still i wonder whether it might be that Cage's position implies less a
'nondual' situation than a multiple one - i've read statements wherein he
speaks against 'unity' in favor of 'multiplicity'

is 'unity' a dualistic notion - maybe so
but is non-dualism also built on a notion of unity ? one without any outside
?

so cd it be that Cage's position has less to do with an argument between 1
and 2
but instead poses in some way an argument for a 3rd position ?

in the Peircean triad each element necessarily mediates between the other
two
Cage's intention to be nonintentional
mediates between the poles of Shultis' study

likewise understanding what Cage is Intending
in relation to "normal" Intention
requires the mediation of some notion of Nonintention

just as understanding in what sense Cage's
work is nonintentional must be mediated
by the fact that he does it - Intends it

at present this is all i have to say about this but i'd be curious to hear
other's responses to the book and to my few sketchy remarks

Grant / Rebecca / poetix

i must confess to a slight guilty joy when i read Rebecca's post
b/c i too feel some frustration when reading something
(hypotheticaly) about Howe or whomever and being led down
the biographical trail in order to be 'set up for' a decisive
reading of some poem of whatever

but then, this is what academic critics do much of the time
(not all the time) so why not simply ignore it ?  i mean, is it
dangerous to me if i pay no mind to its existence ?

maybe so

i imagine an argument cd be made that criticism has some power
over me - what i can publish maybe

but i continue to feel undominated
        [someone will lower the magic duck
         as the phrase of the day
         has been alluded to : 'false consciousness']

but another rub in this case is that Susan Howe has all these
sort of biographical things around too - wherein she
tell you and i and the whoever reads them things
about her life family history etc

i guess these too cd be ignored

but what if they're good ? interesting ? what if they
unsullied by the incursions of limping little academics
fresh off an imagined treadmill.. what if they
<flash>
give you a sudden 'insight' about a poem of Ms. Howe's ?

sleeping with the enemy  ?

Well, let me weigh in with a bit of retro-biographical information about
Howe that speaks against the really wierd idea that the "crappy papers" of
bunch of "middle-class" students who love poetry at "middle-ground state
universities" toll the death knell of "all joy in poetry":

In a 1995 Contemporary Literature interview, Lynn Kelly asked Howe," People
objecting to experimental writing sometimes complain that whatever claims
are made for its social engagement or marxist perspective, or its changing
hegemonic structures of consciousness, that, in fact, the aduience it
reaches is a very narrow, highly educated one, that the reader has to have
tremendous intellectual confidence even to grapple with these texts.  What
do you think?  Does that concern you?"

Howe's reply:  "No.  The objection offends me.  I think it is part of a
really frightening anti-intellectualism in our culture.  Why should things
please a large audience?  And isn't claiming that the work is too
intellectually demanding also saying a majority of people are stupid?
Different poets will always have different audiences.  Some poets appeal to
younger people, some to thousands, one or two to millions, some to older
people, et cetera.  If you have four readers whom you truly touch and maybe
even influence, well then that's fine.  Poetry is a calling.  You are
called to write and you follow."

Howe's comments counter Rebecca's remarks from her post "Re: Shifts in
Modalities" in two totally different ways.  Firstly, Howe refuses to
totalize.  There are various aesthetic communities of readers and writers.
There is no "all" anything.  Secondly, Howe refuses to condescend.  She's
enraged by the condescension.

I wonder if Rebecca thinks being middle class is the problem, or going to a
"middle-ground" state university is a problem--I have an MFA from one of
those places, George Mason in Fairfax, VA,--I went there on purpose, and
believe me, there was all sorts of joyous experimentation and
intellectualism there.  Or if that provisional term of hers, "love" of
poetry is the problem.  What does "love" in quotation marks mean?

Announcing: Snake Hiss / A Transcendental Friend Audio Project


Snake Hiss is the inaugural CD from Immanent Audio, an imprint of
Morningred Dot Com, produced by Debug & Co. The works on this disk were
made by contributors to the Transcendental Friend as audio projects - works
meant to be experienced as sound. From Anselm Berrigan's slanky
sprechgesang with Edmund Berrigan on sprechguitar, to Laird Hunt's eerily
driven Medeival tale to the accompaniment of 1000 humming Niebelungen, to
Jen Hofer's spontaneous auto-lyricical-combustion on the Bay Bridge, to
Heather Fuller's C-Wing Sub-Level 3 interrogation of a microphone, these
works represent a wide variety of approaches to poetry & sound.


Alan Gilbert & Garrett Kalleberg present "Pharmacality," a dialogic montage
with Antonin Artaud, Roger Blin & Jacques Derrida.
Lisa Jarnot performs her "Armadillo" on the streets of Queens, NY.
Marcella Durand reads "Hunt" and "Tnuh" at the same time (some distortion
cannot be avoided).
Jonathan Skinner performs his translation of Ghrasim Luca's "15 Min.
Meta-physical." (Skinner reports that his arms were sore for days
afterwards.)
Duncan Dobbelmann reads his translation of Paul Van Ostaijen's "Sur les
Ponts de Paris," written in the aftermath of Great War Europe, against a
sonic mediascape.
Daniel Machlin & Serena Jost perform "14 Days, 30 Seconds," a collaborative
diary of the creative life of a poet, a musician, a cello, keyboard, bass,
acoustic and slide guitar, and various household paraphernalia.
Jen Hofer improvises "What I Mean to Say" and "Good Directions" on the S.
=46. Bay Bridge.
Laird Hunt reads his translation of "The Vair Palfrey," from the Old French
of Huon le Roi.
Cole Swensen's "Maest=E0" is presented as a montage of voices in counterpoin=
t.
Jesse Glass reads P. M. Deshong's "A Dream," a visionary poem by an unknown
19th century Maryland poet.
Heather Fuller recorded "stricken [from]" with an unknown accomplice.
Anselm Berrigan performs "Fortune's Drift," with Edmund Berrigan on guitar.
Heather Ramsdell & Garrett Kalleberg perform "Send in the Clown," a piece
for two voices and pratfalls.
There is a bonus track.


Sound samples, in the mp3 file format, can be heard from the Snake Hiss page=

This year's publication of the College of Neglected Science, Ribot #7, will be
co-edited by Paul Vangelisti and myself.  The theme is music.  Not necessarily
meditations on music, but certainly work with musicality involved.  The
deadline for that issue is, frankly, right upon us.  April 15.  The issue is
filling up quickly, but anything received by then will be considered.

Announcing TF9, March-April 1999 - Instruments


        http://www.morningred.com/friend/1999/03/cover.html


Issue No. 9 of The Transcendental Friend is called "Instruments" as a
tribute to those who contributed work to the Snake Hiss CD. Snake Hiss is
an Audio Project of the Transcendental Friend, released for the one year
anniversary celebration of TF - a truly wonderful reading and evening in
New York (thank you all!).

This issue of the Schizmata offers "Pas de deux + others," recent work by
the remarkably inventive Stacy Doris, protege of Lully and de Sade, ballet
not included.

This month's Report from Afield is the first edited by Leonard Schwartz,
connoisseur of Gnostic and early Christian speed metal techniques, and
includes work by Danish poet Katrine Marie Guldager (translated by Anne
Mette Lundtofte) and Russian poet Alexander Ulanov (translated by the
author and Michelle Murphy).

Kristen Prevallet, currently under the employ of "Angel" Heurtebise in the
manufacture of musical instruments made of fire, presents early work by
Jean Cocteau in this month's Idiosyncratica.

The Bestiary features a short piece by virtuoso radio player (and part time
microscopist) Heather Ramsdell, called "Newt."

This issue's Project page contains more information about the Snake Hiss
CD, as well as sound samples in the mp3 format.


Thanks for your interest!

(And thank you everyone for your well-wishes for our one year anniversary.)


Yours truly,

Garrett

I tend to agree with Tom Bell on this.  Rebecca's post struck a number of
jangling notes for me.  I probably do love poetry, like I love air (even
though I'm almost afraid of breathing around here when I see the black
veil that shrouds snow after only a few days).  I probably also love
books.  My PhD is probably not from the type of institution Rebecca's
frustrated professor emerged from.  And yes, I have written all those
"crappy papers." I might even be middle-class -- at least I fervently
hoped so when I was a child, though the last 20 years has been quite
disappointing on that front. Anomalous is probably the word that best
describes my grad student / teaching experience.  I don't know which is
more wearying: Rebecca's common rendering or the baffling and ongoing
anomalies which are my daily experience of teaching, writing, reading and
trying to support a family in this country.

I found Grant Jenkins post (thanks for "de-lurking") concerning Susan Howe
to be extremely useful--and I strongly agree with Rebecca Wollf's simplistic
dismissal of it. What Jenkins importantly highlights is the conditions of
production and the possible relationship(s) between that and the writing
process and product. What he was NOT doing is drawing a simple straight line
between a writer's biography and a particular assesment of the writing.
The conditions of a writers' production are IMPORTANT. Who has control of
the means of production in publishing is important. Who has access to those
who control the means is also very important. Yes, there is a cultural elite
in this country.
One of the problems inherent in drawing lines around a category such as
"working class writing," however, is that what is recognized as being a part
of that category is usually a narrative description of an "appropriate"
content: in this case, working, usually in fact men's work.
It's interesting to me, too, that a writer's own class is proposed as not
being a necessary factor for their work to be considered as part of "working
class writing." What I always think of is the category of "African-American
literature." What would happen to that category if we applied the same rule?
Not that I'm defending these categories. On the contrary what I'm interested
in is how these categories are developed and perpetuated within literary
criticism, and how they relate to the process of canonization.
And finally, by the way, I don't think that cultural studies is some kind of
weak veil for "biographical criticism."

Subject:      re C Daly & Loyola fans
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Actually, I only posted because Aldon Neilsen has been indisposed, and this
indisposition removes him some 70 miles from his computer. And because I am
his friend, and because I support the series at Loyola, and because . . . .
Wd be glad to hear a full report. I am removed some 400 miles from this
series.

I can understand C Daly's misgivings abt the spelling of my name. She is
not the first. Besides Bromige (which is how I write it), there is Bromage,
Bromidge (which is how I say it) and Bromwich. It is sd to derive from old
english words either for dairy farm or for the ridge where the broom grows,
and would pin the ancestors to the W Midlands. But London is a melting-pot,
so quien sabe? I found a chemistry treatise by a Jugoslav whose name is
Bromig. Possibly this is pron. as the c in Simic wd be were he in the land
of his birth : tch.

But then again, there is a name on the subcontinent Brahmaraja or close,
and that wd be the most suitable for me. Of course, there are alternative
spellings of many names, (Daley for e.g. with Daly) no doubt due to
illiterate precursors. Accent determined spelling, impinged on the 'norm'
of the scribe. As with all those Ellis Island, excuse the pun,
christenings. (Or variants on port of origin : Heiftiz, Jaffe, Jaffer. . .
. Or variants on verb-forms most assoc. with the person : e.g, Bowering,
from Borrowing. [smiley face here]. ) When a very young movie and tv
fan,our daughter would speak of Alfred Hedgehog, which was probably one
origin of the name Hitchcock.

A name feels cast in concrete but is constantly redefining. Like for e.g.
_The Fall of Because_ a new work by Dave Baratier is and isnt a sonnet
sequence. (Btw, I recommend this for a thorough reading. I think it isnt
available quite yet, but I'll post those details)   David

nancy burr was kind enough to forward this exerpt about moticos and what
RJ says about them.  and actually, this exerpt _was_ in the whitney
exhibit; to my chagrin, i was too stuck on the physical materials they
were made of to connect with this so lucid concept:

This topic is one I follow with interest. I dont know if what I'm about to
say, adds anything to the literature on the subject. To testify, I was born
to a couple from the British workingclass, and many of my class-loyalties
lie there. But my parents were omnivorous readers. So were my sister and I.
My taste in reading became sophisticated beyond that of a number of my
classmates. I won a scholarship to an upper-middle-class school. I was
attacked by workingclass kids on my way home from school, all that. My love
of reading made me a fan of many persons who would never have sat down to
break bread with our family. Evelyn Waugh started higher than I and aspired
yet higher, a horrible snob. But what he could do with narrative and dialog
was seductive. Why I Dont Do Social Realism, etc.  Writing well takes time,
and time takes money, and so the monied classes have given us a
'disproportionate' number of authors. Tilt.

In my work "Lines" e.g.

                           i'm doin okay

Class feels particularly evasive in the U S A. In Canada, as someone
brilliantly generalized, everyone is workingclass. (Exceptions shut up!) In
England, where they tell you class is breaking down, which is a load of
bollocks, it's mainly overclass kids adopting cockney accents, class
remains manifestly a prime shaper of attitudes, expectations, diction,
literature. 'Manifestly,' --yet sub rosa.But the U S A . . .I was shocked
to encounter signs of class war (as subtler, but no less unmistakable,
than, i.e., the bosses' cops gunning down workers) upon coming here.  Like
much of the rest of the world, I suspect, I had been focussed upon the
egalitarian presumption.

I am afraid I made myself un-understandable by a too-swift posting. My use
of the quotation marks around "love books" and "love poetry" was meant to
indicate not irony but sincerity.

Did not mean to offend. Meant to try to explicate my particular
frustrations, which I am sure are quite particular.

I think I'll shut up now.

And let me try to dig myself even a tiny little bit further out of the hole
by saying that I don't identify with the "well-trained professor" of my
oh-so-hasty posting, but rather more with the "folks." Reading over what I
said now I can only lament how  ironically I expressed myself. Really I'm
amazed, more than anything, at the fluctualities of the inflections of my
tones there.

There are, of course, opinions expressed in the posting that I do stand by,
but they are not particularly well-expressed.

Thank you, and good night.

program,
the Otis website address is-- www.otisart.edu

The requirements are listed below.

MFA IN WRITING

First Year

Critical Theory & Practice  (3 units - 2 semesters) =97 Two-semester,
joint offering with the Graduate Program in Fine Arts, required of both
first year Fine Arts and Writing students. The course is an in-depth
examination of a critical or theoretical text, focusing on contemporary
issues in the verbal and visual arts, and how the text and the issues
raised ultimately relate to the students' own work.

Fiction Workshop/ Poetry Workshop  (4 units - 2 semesters) =97 Two-year
course sequence in the student's area of emphasis, i.e. fiction or
poetry, with a different poet or fiction writer each semester. Also, as
part of the course, the student will meet with the program director, as
well as other graduate faculty during the semester.

Writing as Critical Practice  (3 units - 2 semesters) =97 Two-year course
sequence in which both fiction writers and poets discuss practical
critical issues by focusing on a literary historical or genre issue,
such as the epic tradition, the quotidian, writing as social sign, the
contemporary literary scene, etc. Topics and instructors will rotate on
a semester basis.

Special Topics in Literary Studies  (3 units - 2 semesters)  =97 First
year sequence: "Translation Seminar" (in which students will attempt
fiction or poetry translations, confronting the fundamental problem of
literary translation, as well as acquiring some first-hand knowledge of
literary traditions outside that of Anglo-American literature); and an
elected course from pertinent "Advanced Topics in English" offerings,
designated for upper division/graduate credit.

Units: 26

Second Year

Fiction Workshop/ Poetry Workshop   (4 units - 2 semesters)

Writing as Critical Practice  (3 units - 2 semesters)

Special Topics in Literary Studies (3 units - 2 semesters) =97 Second year
sequence: "History & Practice of the Book" (an examination of the
material history and theory of the "book," and its continuing
problematic issues of reception, in which students will construct a
small book that embodies the personal and public concerns implicit in
their own writing); and an elective from "Advanced Topics in English"
offerings.

Art History Elective (2 units - 1 semester) =97 To be chosen, preferably
in first semester of second year, from the "Art History & Theory"
courses offered in Liberal Studies.

I'm glad the issue of class has cropped up because for years I've
wondered what class is.  It's interesting to me that whenever class is
discussed actual definitions of class seem to evade the argument.  Since
I have spent my life thus far between America and the UK I would have
thought that, particularly from living in the UK, I should have some
idea of what class is. I have asked this question before and have had
answers ranging from the idea of wealth being tied with class to simply
an accent.  That class and language are connected in some way is
tempting; so is it language that separates the classes?

I've been told several times that because I don't know what class I am I
must be middle class; On my first or second day of my undergrad. degree
a lecturer told us that no matter what we thought we were, we are now
middle class since we entered a university course.  My nieghbor who
alone earns more than my wife and I together considers himself working
class (he does have the accent).  this class issue seems to me awfully
muddled, as I think much of this anterior identity seeking is.

I don't mean to be confrontational.  I simply do not know what class
is... that is not to say I don't see social discrepancies between
individuals or groups, but to add the structure of class...?

Yes, Linda.  I disagree with that quote too, which i noted at the time.  I was
saying it was one way that l-p could be read.  And thank you for pointing out
the problems that result from that reading (eg gender gets nullified).

i also agree with you in that i don't see l-p as a relevent term or grouping
now.  i tend to believe it was real at one point tho.  and admire the energy
and work that resulted from it.

I think I misread your original post, where somehow it seemed you were the one
calling for more "taxonomies" like l-p.  i can't see where i or  tom0 were
calling for new taxonomies.

I guess i read the open letter issue as a taxonomy "move" like l-poets made.
Here is some theoretical work and here are some of my friends here, here and
here, and here are their poems and we're united against capitalism.  and you
can tell that by the disconnected style we use.  also i think some of the
writers included in that issue were a little surprised to find themselves
apparently unified under the rubric of jeff.

so my problem i suppose is that move was interesting (to me) back when i was
starting to read.  but now it sounds hollow.  editing projects that are more
interesting to me don't group by form, friends, loyalities.  i think the New
(Am) anthos suffers from a lyrical form grouping, a weird nationalist grouping
and not enough people of color.  tho it has the advantage of not surrounding
the poems with theoretical constructs through which we are supposed to read.
chain is a funny example because it groups by form. but discrete form, not the
correct form of a new movement.  the end result is hard to describe.  which is
good.  tinfish has a similar confusion, tho grouped around "region".

identity groupings by gender, race, class, seem more valuable to me.  or
valid.  or grounded in their opposition, but i don't have the theoretical
vocabulary to say anything relevent re .  i guess i am suspicious of the new
open letter's largely white grouping. it is a problem of the avant-gararge.  i
suppose i am part of that problem too.

i guess what i meant by many to many relationships is to avoid seeing yourself
as part of one mini-group composed of relatively similar reflections of
yourself.  because that leads to mini-group fight.  eg langp-po nyc mini group
and nyc school mini-group in early 80s.  if bruce andrews reads 1st with
elinor nauen, l-poets stay for bruce and walk for elinor.  nyc school poets
show up late and miss bruce.  they dislike each other for no good reason i can
think of.

contradictorily, i believe it's important, maybe even vital, to have close
writer friends and alliances.  and those friendships, those mini-groups tend
to be fairly homogeneous wrt to the big identity 3.  friendship "is" that way.
but it's vital to seek out much that is outside that mini-group.  to break
down the notion that friendship is natural.

so you can see i don't really know what i mean by grouping.  an essay i like
is called SpiderWasp and literary criticism by J spahr, the ideas of which i
seem to be summarizing rather poorly:  "There is clearly right now an increase
in mismatchings, in joinings. . . .  and the joinings that are happening here
are as diverse as the things joined. But nonetheless, all this work can be
characterized by its refusal of allegiance to any specific school and a
parallel proclamation of an allegiance to more than one school."

i think that is a getting at of a definition of many to many.  which is a
relational database term.  take user and group as entities (tables).  if there
is a many to many relationship between these entities, one user can be in many
groups and one group can contain many users.

alternately, i read, reductively i'm sure, early l-p and the recent open
letter as enacting a one to many relationship.  a group can contain many
users, but a user belongs to only one goup.

thanks for your time.  it seems like we are really in agreement on much of
this.  i don't know how to proceed.

Bill

I would tend to agree but then your terms are so general here that I'm not
sure what I'd be agreeing with. What do you mean by grouping -- a sort of
self-selection?  or that of the taxonomist?  We can't first look for
commonalities without first deigning to articulate them, no?  But these
writings would then be your "ghosts"?  How does one proceed?>>

Belgrade, 24 march, 99
2pm.


dear friends,

we have received many letters of support, calls from our friends
from Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia, thank you.
The situation:
Many women are affraid more or less.  last night some of us  have
worked in the Womens Center untill 9pm, and after that the town was
calm and empty, and some citizens were around entrance of houses and
some in the cellers.
The parts of the town near the military bases felt hard detonations
and saw the fire.  Those in the center of town did not.
The telephone lines have  become difficult.


The worry of pacifists is the situation on Kosovo.
First, most artillery the serbian army has concentrated in the region
of Kosovo. Last night i finally caught the telephone lines with
Pristina and talked to my friend, and she said that the biggest worry
is the vengeance of serbian army against albanian population.
The CNN and BBC TV stations are obviously very pro-violence oriented
and they have inflicted much fear into people in Kosovo, on top of
the facts that are fearfull in themselves. The serbian officials have
cut electriciy in Pristina last night, and tuned in this morning.
The cutting of electricity was clearly the act of producing more fear
on the one already there.  So you can imagine the mood in Pristina.
This morning there is no bread and milk in most of the shops  in
Belgrade and Pristina.
and it is a beautifull sunny day.


The fact that enrages is that serbian regime has totally and
apsolutelly taken the control  of all the media.  Which means that
only few words come in, and that language of hatred, production of
enemies and vengeance politics is increasing every minute.   Four
TV stations fused in one and two others in the other one.  The people
who do not have satellite TV get few news per hour, about shelters
and enemies, and nothing else.  This is as well frightening.

Many women did not sleep last night,
and sirenas are on and off every couple of hours. So some of us are
constatly on the phone with those who feel bad.


Once again feminists and pacifists from Belgrade are again this time
sending sisterly tender words for our friends and Albanian women and
their families in Kosovo.

Since Kathy Lou Schultz brought up my name in the discussion of  class, I
guess it=92s time to toss in a few of my own thoughts and observations on =
the
subject.

Most of us here are interested in exploring poetic form, with all its
possibilities and limitations, so I=92ll leave that aside for now and
concentrate on content -- which is where I believe class differences show =
up
most clearly among =93arty=94 writers. (Thanks for that term Dodie.) Conce=
ding to
Grant Jenkins that =93there is no necessary or predetermined relation betw=
een
class and poetic production,=94 I still see some general tendencies that a=
ppear
to fall along class lines. Among what I consider to be academically (middl=
e
class) influenced magazines and presses, the grittier aspects of life are
often not addressed at all or they=92re abstractified to the point of numb=
ness.
The middle class tendency to smooth over all roughness, to hush the noise,=
 to

producing about as much engagement as watching a roomful of people think.
Added value is accrued by including references to philosophical or literar=

Now, on a slightly different tangent: the social aspects of class as they =

out among those on our end of the poetic spectrum. I want to say Amen! to =

(For those of you who wanted a definition of class, this is a good startin=

Joe=92s post and this whole discussion was sparked by events at the Page M=

social occasion, providing opportunities to meet lots of people interested=

(at
least I don=92t remember seeing any). The sessions were held in the relati=

to the campus pub. And why? Mainly because of who was expected to attend, =
I
would guess. How much noise they would be willing to put up with (another

 the

Well, this has been a brief and inadequate attempt to raise aspects of the
class issue that have been on my mind for some time. Now back to lurking

Rebecca and List,

The beauty of email is that we can pop off and vent when we need to without
overcensoring ourselves--especially on a List like this where we can
usually count on sympathetic or invested ears.  I can't speak for anyone
else, but I just keep my skin a little tougher when I post.  You can never
tell how another will read you, and in this medium the other can tell you
immediately how she/he read you.

Rebecca wrote:

>There are, of course, opinions expressed in the posting that I do stand by,
>but they are not particularly well-expressed.

I think you should elaborate those opinion rather than shut up (the recent
post on politeness in women's writing comes to mind).  I still am
interested in whty you think the joy of poetry is because why we DO poetry
at all is intertwined with this class question.

A few more thoughts on class, then, while I'm at it.  As David Bromige wrote:

>Writing well takes time,
>and time takes money, and so the monied classes have given us a
>'disproportionate' number of authors

I think one should still start asking questions of class in the context of
economics.  It seems in this arena, there is a confluence of many
conditions:  race, gender, history, etc.  Virginia Woolf says that a
(woman) writer needs about 50 pounds a year in order to create the minimum
conditions necessary to writing.  That was in 1929, mind, and the problem
was (and still is), of course, how a woman could achieve such a financial
goal.   But the sentiment I think still holds true today:  one must have
support to write.  For many reasons, one would be very hard pressed to be
below the poverty line and write.

Being an academic, especially at a non-PhD granting institution, as Mairead
pointed out in her post, is still work.    When I have 50 essays to grade
over a weekend, it's likely I won't get much writing done.  It's just an
economic limit.  If I won the lottery, I guarantee I would write more.
Simple economics.

I think it's crucial to avoid a more vulgar position that says middle-class
= bad, working class = good, or whatever.  There is no necessary relation
between class and output by a writer.  Class is a condition, not a
determinant.  This is why the class one identifies with (which may be
different than economic category) can make a difference in one's writing.

Now, I'll shut up.

This is a great thread.  I'm learning a lot.

Grant

P.S.  Dear San Fran, one of Wittgenstein's students writes somewhere
that his dear teacher once said that philosophy is simply the
(mechanical?) effort to ask the same question 1000 times.  Could anyone
do a reprise on Ben Hollander's essay on Reznikoff re "accent?"  It's in
one of those circulars that came out of 7722 Lynn in the spring of 95
republished in France.  One of the sharpest contributions to this
question of class I remember is Kim's "you sound like immigrants" spoken
at the class talk when?  That to move from one class to another is not a
betrayal, per se, unless you're a dogmatist, or self-flagellationist,
but an act or migration as brave and intelligent and necessary as every
woman and child and man who scales the wall south of san diego.

poetic'eers
       i was wondering what yr opinion/response was to bpNichol's
_TTA:Translating Translating Appolinaire_ - having read it now, and in the
process responding to a freind's essay on TTA, i believe that TTA explores,
much like bp's other works - the physical materiality of language. with TTA,
bp also probes the space between languages (that s the difficulties of
placing a translated text between the original (and its language base) and
the restraints of the 2nd language) as well as the chalenges of faithful
translations. the process of manipulation and translation is then used as a
means of exploring the alphabetic symbols (as in the pieces from TTA18) as
well as memory as both recollector and creator... (TTA also can relate to
nichol's other works of translations like Six Fillous, the catallus poems,
etc) i was just wodnering if anyone else had critical response to TTA, or if
they would like to receommend further homolinguistic translations, etc...
    well thats it...

Class plays itself out in contradictory ways. For example,
some traditionally male working class union jobs pay more
than teaching jobs which require a college education. But
ya' know? I'm a girl from the working class and I swear I
can smell class. I can sniff it out. I'm rarely wrong.
What does this mean? Perhaps that those less privileged
become adept at reading class codes--and often at adopting
those of the upper classes as a means of survival. For
example, I've been hyper-aware of my grammar since I was a
child because I was deeply pained by the disrespect heaped
upon my parents (in particular my father) and I understood
that the way they were treated was in part because of the
way they spoke and dressed. These experiences are very
real and become deeply ingrained in the psychology of
children. Another question, what happens to the "power of
the father" in the face of a working class father who has
little power outside of the home/in the marketplace? These
are not easy questions. They have everything to do with
reading/writing.

I just received the following.
Viktor is the son of Miroljub Todorovic, longtime publisher of =
SIGNAL and a visual poet.
All I can think of is to send it to the literary listservs I belong =
to. I think the bombing must stop, but  it probably won't for fear =
of loss of face, and the US will hardly invade with ground troops =
insofar as we sensationalize the recovery of one downed pilot, and, =
in any case, I'm sure all of you who are concerned have gone =
through the back-and-forth thinking I and others I know have been =
used to in our  own minds without knowing what to do. If any of you =
can think more effectively about all this,please let us know.

At most I try to keep in touch with yugo-links at

http://noel.pd.org/topos/free-zone/yugo-links.html

and Chris Cheek's recommendation of

http://www.pd.org/topos/links/links-frame.html

So far I can't get immediate news from either and when I get Real =
Audio unfortunately it's in Serbian (i.e., I can't translate, not =
Serbian meaning the bad guys). The Todorovics are Belgrade Serbians =
active in the student strikes in Belgrade of a year or so past.

I include enclosure, but I don't understand it.

It will, however, be on summer vacation for August.

I am new to the list and rather new to contemporary
innovative poetry in general (some of us are pretty slow,
what can I say), but am happily trying to find my feet.

I am going to attend the Cambridge (UK) poetry conference
on April 23-25, bracketing it with a brief holiday in London
and Edinburgh.  I would be very happy to meet any list
members (or anyone else) who might be attending this
event, and would love to hear from you via email before-
hand.

Also, if anyone could clue me in on interesting poetry
events in London during April 19-22 or Edinburgh
during April 26-29 I would be very grateful.

Thanks and regards to all,
Harold Teichman

Looking over the exchange that Betsy Andrews post between the two
aformentioned writers, I come to a different conclusion about this
exchange. You may notice that LK's question (her formulation of an
'objection' that could be raised to Susan Howe's poetry) is not really
being addressed by SH, at least that's what I noticed....
For LK asks about EDUCATION, asks whether a poetry like Howe's
may only reach a "very narrow, highly educated," audience,
and whether, in America today, one may have "tremendous intellectual
confidence" WITHOUT being "highly educated." I thus see HOWE as
misreading LK's question, because S.Howe seems to "elide" the
distinction between "highly educated" and "intellectualism"....
I think it's possible that one may be "intellectual" without
being "highly educated." It's even quite plausible that in many cases
being "highly educated" can GET IN THE WAY, or detract, from being
intellectual. And even though I, with Howe, question the "frightening
anti-intellectualism" of our society, and even her Stevensian notion
that poets may (if not must) address themselves to an elite,
I think the distinction (implicit at least) in LK's question between
an "highly educated" elite and an "intellectual" one (i use the term
intellectual more loosely, as a sense of rigorous thought-engagement
even if it lacks the proper pedigrees and references) needs at least
to be entertained if not stressed....
For, I know many intellects who have succumbed to a feeling of
inadequacy in not being "highly educated" enough, many intellectuals
who lack "intellectual confidence" (just as conversely, there are
some who "possess" such "intellectual confidence" who may not be
as intellectual as many of those who lack such confidence....)

Anyway, perhaps this is too nitpicky (my method of stressing a few
of the words, in a way I call "close reading"), but I think it DOES
relate to Rebecca Woolf's original point (however expressed, and
misunderstood, and perhaps by myself). I, speaking only for myself here
though, find a reductive binary formulation contrasting "highly educated"
and "intellectual" useful here: I consider Howe (and Olson and Pound, who
in many ways she resembles) to be a poet that does require a more
"highly educated" indidividual to read and appreciate (the learned
references that point the reader to texts by COTTON MATHER or Fenellosa,
etc., as if one must read them in order to "fully appreciate" Howe's
and Pound's project) and would contrast this to other poets that, though
they themselves may be considered "elite" and certainly at least as
"highly educated," do not require as blatantly such "highly educated"
readers (say, Stein, Riding, Stevens, Ashbery, for instance....if I'm
going to play the lineage game here....). Sure, there are moments in
some of this latter group in which "allusions" and references may
flatter the highly educated (Ashbery's titles referencing the "tradition"
and all the "in jokes" and "appropriations" from other texts), but it's
been my experience at least that they are not as NECESSARY to the
appreciation of the poem and the project, one can "get" and/or at least
enjoy Ashbery without knowing that he's quoting a lengthy passage from
a famous victorian. Anyway, I guess right now, I "side" with the latter
mode, but I am certainly open to anybody calling my formulation into
question.......

Does anyone out there know anything about the work of Abigail Child?  I
just recently saw part of a film of hers entitled "Is This What You Were

Recently, I've been informed that the panellists giving papers, and/or
talks at the Barnard Conference HAVE TO PAY A FEE in order to attend
this conference. I personally (as well as some others I've talked to)
find this appalling. When Stephen Cope (are you there Stephen; if so,
backchannel please) invited me to be part of the conference, he made
no mention of it, and since it was "in my backyard" as it were, I
was thinking I--if not getting paid for my efforts--would at least
not have to PAY to participate. I do not know if the "big names" are
getting paid to present here, and I certainly have no gripe with them
if they are, but the idea that us "smaller names" have to PAY is
something I wish I would have been told up front. I understand that
the organizers are putting a lot of work into this conference, but
Barnard, one would think, certainly wouldn't benefit from the "petty
cash" it would extract from underpayed (underused) academically
unafffiliated writers....
So, I'm wondering if there's anything that can be done about this?

Best,
Chris Stroffolino

Black plane cuts the furrows weather-vaning across tillage
and you can dream your bright lights, you can dream your

the two of us. The deep slits in the dry dark earth carry
water down and out to the road. The road's always filled but
the people are invisible and I do not love them and will not
learn to love them.

         no thing, there are no thing.

We do know the world and could make everything true and
beautiful. We choose to fuck and love violently and hard.

     yet another character in drag


scene 1 [Rebecca's dining room]

  Django Prejsnar : and with this ode i deliver another smashing blow to the
corporate capitalist state!

[a grunt is heard drifting on the wind from downtown]

  Luther Jondross : (in a croony singsong as always) but you did go out of
turn and i don't think that sets a very good precedent for the post
revolutionary
world now, do you? (rummages around in his bag) hey i forgot something,
i gotta run down to my car

scene two
  [on the staircase - two students are walking up Luther is walking down]

Two Students: (in unison) um... do you know where Rebecca Hyman lives?

Luther: well ahh.. yes - upstairs in number 10.  you haven't got violence on
your mind or anything do you ? i see that you have suspicious under-arm
bulges and very cop-like footwear...

Two students: (in unison) no. of course not. nothing like that. we are just
students. students of rebecca hyman. we were just in the neighborhood. that
is all. students.

Luther: (releaved) O, OK..

scene 3 [in the back of a surveilance van M.X.Maogooglaham is bound and
seated on the floor - Jimmy Dickey sits in a chair listening to Luther and
the Two Students on a tiny speaker]

Miguel: you'll never get away with this Dickey!

Dickey: shut up you (hits Miguel in the ear with a coffee cup)

scene 4 [rebecca's stark and inhospitable bohemian flat - Luther walks in
the door]

Luther: where are the two students

Rebecca: they came, they left. they were supposed to meet someone at the
cafe and got stood up so they came looking for me.

Luther: but where did they go ? i didn't see them on the stairs or coming
back from my car - all i saw was a big dark colored cable repar van out
there with some smack & groan noises coming out of it

James: well, i refrained from asking but i didn't think they looked like
students - i thought they looked like the new class-09 surveilance droids
the firm has taken to using whenever one of our temp secretaries calls in
sick

Rebecca: i assure you i've seen them in class - they're always perfectly
punctual

James: ah-ha!

Fernando: so, Luther did you find what you were looking for? (he raises an
eyebrow suggestively)

[ just then the door bursts open and in rushes Jimmy Dickey gun in hand in a
trenchcoat with elbow patches ]

Jimmy: nobody move or i'll blast you bunch a pinkos right where you sit

Fernando: (laughing) check out his fly!

[Dickey looks down and everyone lunges for him - in the struggle Django
pauses after stepping on Dickey's toe and has a sip of his beer - a flying
elbow shatters the glass and chaos erupts as the Two Students enter from the
bathroom and attack - it's a free-for-all]

Luther: Ouch!

Two Students: (in unison) ZAP!

Fernando: POW!

Rebecca: i'll flunk you losers

James: ah-ha!

[everyone turns to look at James who triumphantly yanks the cords out of the
backs of the two students leaving them immobile]

James: you see, they were droids - either we forgot that they'd come over
and then gone to the bathroom together or they came in thru the mysterious
window. but either way, their big mistake was in plugging themselves into
the bathroom socket.

Jimmy: you better let me go you poet-freaks - i got yr friend Miguel Xavier
Maogooglaham and if i don't walk outta here safe and sound he'll be buried
under computer book contracts for the next 8 -10 months

Everyone (except Jimmy): Gasp!

[a tense silence follows.. finally Luther Rebecca Fernando James and Django
start to speak all at once. everyone stops again]

Luther: i think i speak for all of us... we're not letting you leave Dickey
- you see, it's just as easy to make fun of Miguel when he aint here as
when he is - and you definately ain't walking out of here until you
autograph The Younger American Poets for us

Dickey: curses! oh alright, gimme it...

[Fernando hands it over]

Luther: say "to my dear friend Luther, you're more of a poet when you're
flatulent than i when at my peak"

Fernando: wait aminute, that's MY book, Dickey, write "I'm a big loser and i
wish i was cool enough to be in the APG."

Rebecca, James, Django: that's good... yeah

[at this point the APG realizes that someone has been hurt and that there
is, as per the Stein title, BLOOD ON THE DINING ROOM FLOOR - Dickey's
trenchcoat and paper towels are used to mop up the blood - meanwhile Django,
discovering he's lost another finger cries out]

Django: dang it.. what next (he holds his arm up to help it stop bleeding)

[Cagney, Lacy & Stacy burst thru the doorway followed by a cameraman]

Cagney: alright nobody move

Lacy: yeah, take it easy everyone

Stacy: Klinger get a close up of Dickey (cameraman complies and we see that
it's the lovable Corporal Klinger in a Mata Hari style ensemble) so what
have
we got here ?

Cagney : well - there's Luther Jondross, one time member of line break
police - and that's Django Prejsnar

Lacy: these wd be the two droids i see

Cagney: yes...

Stacy: two worthless poets, two droids, two lamps, Jimmy Dickey and who
might you be ? (she turns abruptly to James who had been sitting quietly
at the table with a Weekly World News obscuring his face)

James: i'm their lawyer (he gestures toward Luther and Django) any questions
you ask them you ask thru me, got it?

[there is obvious friction and desire in the room as Hotlips locks eyes with
our not so nice trucker and bardly barrister]

Cagney: give it a rest, Stacy - let's just get Dickey and go rough him up a
little, whataya say ?

[from out of nowhere Finster the cat lunges at the exposed ankle of Jimmy
Dickey tearing away a hunk of flesh - he screams - the APG appauds - the
police women momentarily forgetting their desire to do bodily harm to Dickey
and attempt to keep Finster away from him]

Lacy: it's too dark in here - turn on one of these lamps.

Cagney: (reaching out she grasps Rebecca's earlobe and yanks) bulb must be
burned out - these lamps are strange neither of the shades match but the
bases
are both wearing sweaters that neither match the shades or each other

Stacy: aesthetics is not our beat

[the cat is not found and Cagney, Lacy & Stacy drag Dickey out the door and
down the hall - he can be heard pleading for a chance to write directions
for the use of small appliances or perhaps school lunch menus - their cruel
laughter drifts back into the apartment]

Fernando: (taking off his lampshade) that was close

Rebecca: (also removing hers and dropping it back into the suspicious sack
brought by Prunty) and that yank on the lobe was an oucher!

Luther: well, cool, all that's over with. same time next week?

Rebecca, Django, Fernando, James, Finster: yeah. sure.

this focus,
this communication,
this concentration,
let it's power reign,
let it make a change
It may be so easy for us to say
as our skies are not filled
with fire
here

and we do not hide in our houses
in such a way

but as we are human
one family
we feel
and we pray
bring an end to all suffering
bring an end to all violence

derek and others interested:

Yes, TTA presents the things you mention below, as well as a different way
of thinking about literary history, how we view past works and what we
might do with them, and definitely an appreciation of the physical
manifestation of the text, so it's not, to me, just the "physical
materiality of language," but how all aspects of physical presentation
contribute to the *meaning* of the work. Not all of these aspects are
characteristics of language, some are products of the photocopying process
as in SHARP FACTS: Variations on TTA 26, and some are Nichol's inventions
concerning possible arrangements of the specific language of the poem.

Several parts of Translating Translating Appolinaire, as well as different
writers'/artists' extension of the work, are online at the Light & Dust
poets site. To find them, go to
http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/lighthom.htm
and scroll down the alphabetical author list to the Nichol entries.

thanks for this, chris, particularly in the midst of the class/money
thread. I know that this was one conference I found out about only too late
to think of participating in as a panelist, but the fees also made me
immediately dismiss it as something I would not be able to attend. I know
not all conferences can be underwritten by grants and university funds --
but for some of us, particularly if we are unaffiliated with programs that
might pay for us to go there, there's just no chance. As for another recent
conference, I had been told that book sales would not be allowed at the
PageMothers conference, and that took away one possible avenue of paying at
least part of the expenses of a San Diego trip (not far from here), which
contributed to my inability to attend that conference. I try to take one
trip a year, either to a conference or to give readings, because once a
year I can apply and usually receive some funding from local and state arts
agencies for such travel purposes. Other trips may happen when there are
invitations to totally funded readings. Beyond that, it's pretty much just
stay home and work -- and that's not bad, but certainly the in-person
contact with colleagues is limited.

I agree with Joe Amato, everything points to or from money in one way or
another.

chris this is pretty common, as at MLA, ASA, etc. you have to register,
which costs bucks, sometimes big bucks, and then pay your own expenses when
yr there... unless you've got a generous dept. or special travel funds...
sucky but true...

Subject:      The APG in Tuscaloosa 3.6.99
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

on March 6th three parts of the APG (Atlanta Poetry Group) - namely Mark
Prejsnar, Randy Prunty and )ohnLowther set out from @lanta for Tuscaloosa
and a day of poetry-related activities - also a day of forgetting that
Tuscaloosa is on the other side of the time line and thus lots of thinking
we were late and/or getting to places early

the ride went and town was reached motel checked-in and campus found (in
spite of slanty directions - and a raspberry for Jon Berry) - at 1pm a panel
began to take form in yellow brick english building - milling about and then
seated, in addition to the APG were Hank Lazer, Jake Berry, Jon Berry, Jack
Foley, Michael Martone, a collector of experimental literature named Sachler
(i believe), William Doty, Bill Lavender, Adele Foley (ever-present on the
microphones an tape machine) and some folks we didn't know or meet

Jon Berry read a list of questions - supposedly 6 or 7 - for lack of
anything else let's call the topic 'contemporary literature' - and then the
show began... well the 'panel' - not really that 'showy' but you follow

i took no notes and so will undoubtedly miss much - but - M.Martone's talk
was about a series of 'travel pieces' he's been writing about Ohio - he's
interested in the frame in which they get published and instead of sending
them to ficton venues or whatever he tries to publish in small local
newspapers in ohio
        Jack Foley had a prepared talk for which i wd be hard pressed to
extract any single thesis - various phrases stuck out "a blind man haunts
literature" (homer, don't you know) much was made of this by Foley that it
was a challenge to literature on the page and - "the crisis of literature"
apparently something due to the various options we have now, print, orality,
electronic - this drew a lot of questioning - mainly from me as i felt and
feel that the 'crisis' but is much overplayed - what of the crisis of colas
? we RC, Pepsi, etc... Foley used a series of examples that one can find in
early Derrida and at times seemed to be ghosting along in parallel to a
Jerome Rothenberg essay that i read someplace - within al of this it seem
that he wants to see a more conscious return to Orality (big O) and he feels
that the web/net (has anyone remarked on the slight creepiness of those two
images) will somehow promote this thing he wants to happen - after
criticizing langpo as poetry that is 'only on the page' he told me i wd see
what more cd be done with poetry if i attended the reading that evening
        Jake Berry's comments were impressionistic and responsive to the
mood up until that point - he put no program forward but seemed generally
pleased that the internet was in some sense letting poets have more access
and exposure
        Marvin Sachler spoke next from the standpoint of collector and
audience for poetry & literature but not - as he insisted - producer - with
his talk the themes of internet triumphalism that had been manifest in
Foley's talk and pointed at in Jake's came rushing to the fore - this
provoked some pointed questions about why poets should strive to have big
audiences and general critique of the rah rah web web cheering that had been
going on - Mr Sachler is certainly entitled to his opinions but to my ears
they boiled down to  a) writers should make their work more appealing
visually so more people will be motivated to look at it and  b) everyone
should use the internet so that they can have a bigger audience - as was his
wont Jack Foley got into this on Sachler's side of the debate and when i
said something about poetry never having had a large audience by today's
standards he disagreed and cited  some work of the 19th C and how widely
distributed it was - i have forgotten what this was unfortunately but i'm
tempted to think it was by Longfellow - my suggestion was that if this sort
of popularity was wanted then this sort of work ought be written
        Hank Lazer was next and he addressed more directly and with greater
balance the web rhetoric as rhetoric while also not dismissing the work that
is available there - Hank's talk was full of questions and  had a poetic
structure in many senses (which was unfortunately interrupted by another
panelist who desired to talk over it at times) - sorry to say that much of
what he was doing or trying to do in his piece was i think overshadowed by
the specters of arguments already raised
        it ended with Sachler showing us some goodies from his collection

the APG went in search of food and drink
times passed
we noted that we had little remaining until the performance was set to begin
we were wrong (time zone)
and arrived an hour early

the evening's performance was held in a small theatre - a good space i
thought for this sort of thing - the nights program was divided into two
parts - roughly an hour each
        in the 1st hour Jack and Adelle Foley, Jake Berry, and Hank Lazer
performed - the Foleys read together to begin - Jack seemingly the dominant
(certainly louder) and then Adelle coming in to read on top of him in a
performance that was - if nothing else - Loud - the material itself was hard
for me to get much sense of behind the very theatrical inflection and
general ostentatiousness of their production - but what i cd make out gave
me some sense of why Jack cited Dylan Thomas several times during the
afternoon panel - their performances cd also i think be characterized by a
two-tone sense of dynamics; loud (relative to speaking) and LOUD relative to
anything (be warned - i'm not in sympathy with Foley's work and so what
merits it may have i cannot hope to point to) - but
        Hank was great - he was working with musical accompaniment from Jake
Berry (guitar playing submerged bluesy stuff) and Wayne (forgot the last
name - he's a photographer i understand and a pretty sympathetic accompanist
on a variety of non-standard percussion instruments) - Hank's readings were
varied and i had varied responses to them - one that struck me as
particularly successful had him read a whole text of a poem to light
accompanying sounds and then to improv his way thru it a 2nd time in
collaboration with more input from Jake and Wayne - another that stuck out
for the APG featured a line something like "Chilli Davis Legged out a
grounder" - which Mark P - baseball man that he is 'got' to me it was a rush
of interesting sounds that left me wondering for several seconds before
something whispered 'baseball?' in my head
        Jake Berry read from Brambu Drezi book II (i think) and had only
Wayne on percussion to work with - but i must say that while i am generally
skeptical about the use of musical stuff with poetry - i think that these
two worked very very well together - one reason for this is that Jake's work
live has a chant-like insistence to it that Wayne was able to highlight
without ever getting in the way of - a portion of Jake's reading was in some
other language (made-up? real? glossolalia?) - this was maybe my favorite
part of the whole thing as he really kicked the words out of his mouth with
a lot of energy and yet never succumbed to theatricality - the live reading
didn't change my thinking about Jake's work but definitely intensified the
sense of it as a life-project and thickened the vibe which at times suggests
snake-handling and 'old-time religion' (think of the beefheart song) as well
as a sort of gothic sensibility with hints of voodoo and - frankly -
suffering (why this collection doesn't add up to pretense is what makes
Jake's work worthwhile)

the 2nd hour was a grab bag of everybody else who came that had something to
read - a visual highlight was a tuscaloosa native named Darryl standing tall
and dressed in a charmingly outlandish fashion with dozens of ear-rings
bracelets necklaces buckles and straps with flowing garb + a derby hat
(there were feathers involved someplace i know) - but the visual highlight
was him holding up in the spotlights a large translucent green dildo which
wagged limply back and forth sending out green reflections
        Susan Holbrook a poet from vancouver read from a series of prose
poems that build on lines from the brother grimm - i think the project is
called 'Grimm" but am not sure - the syntax was mostly normative and the
action came out of the sexual hints and suggestions in the opening lines
which wd then get played out and turned around and around as the piece moved
on
        we of the APG read as well - Mark took stage first and read from his
Loss Leider poems - and did i think a pretty bang up job of it - i read from
a ms. called Aeros in Err - Randy read a selection of poems and managed to
get the house lights turned up and had copies for everyone in the audience
which i think helped what was already a really great performance on his part
(clearly the best of the three of us that evening)
        the last reader and a stupendous show-closer was Bill Lavender -
introduced as The Man from New Orleans - Bill has great presence on stage
and sort of lacsidasical presentation that combined beautifully with a
substantial piece of poetry that made loops within itself to continually
revisit a particular joke the terms and punchline of which varied throughout
- it was really pretty great - not much else i can say about it

after the performance we all went to a mexican restaurant when thru a series
of mime-like activities and gestures i was able to get something that had no
meat in it - everybody drank beer and margaritas and got pretty silly until
time to go to sleep & Jake Berry looked very green under fluorescent light

Hank was a great host and we look forward to going to other events there in
the future - perhaps there are others in the southeast that might also in
the future attend

Kathy Lou, this seems to me a very mixed blessing.  I suppose there were
always those who could sniff out a Catholic or a Jew or a Black.  Often
the sniffing is offensive rather than defensive.  Sniff away: I find the
notion obnoxious.

In an issue of Adz, early 1980's there is an interview in English with
Jean-Paul Curtay, a second or third generation Letterist with a book in

important resource for info on the topic.

Miekal,

You probably already know about this, but "Poems for the Millennium," Volume
II (Rothenberg/Joris) has about 4 pages of excerpts.  If you don't have
access let me know and I'll copy the stuff for you and send it by email.

The President may be contacted via the www at The White House site,
<www.whitehouse.gov>; this is done with a form, so there's no
"portable" email address I can provide.

The State Department, too, has a "feedback" section; the URL for
that site is <www.state.gov>. Their "foreign policy opinion" email
address is <publicaffairs@panet.us-state.gov>.

Email is better than nothing, but personally I think it's a good
idea always to couple that with a snail-mail letter or a telephone
call - the relative ease of email contact (and email petitioning)
is not lost to these people.

poetry/poetics listservs through the bombing of Iraq and now Serbia.
I would like to see if it is possible to establish longer dialogues
than those which have erupted in immediate reaction to attack.  Poets
everywhere are welcome to join.  This is an unmoderated list.

i feel that i would argue that howe's formulation of the question is *the
better of the two*...

quite simply, the question as it was put to her, does point up precisely
the anti-intellectualism that is a basic structural component of U.S.
culture.  De Toqueville mentioned it sharply.  It is deeply rooted and
old, and distinguishes this national culture from many others..

i understand the point Chris is making below; it is not a totally
wrongheaded distinction, i think;  but (his "nitpicky" comment does indeed
get a bit at what i feel...) it is a very fine-grained distinction, and i
believe it doesn't do justice to the relevance of Howe's point.

These questions about educational level, etc., are often thrown at
interesting poetry;  and are very instructive for what they suggest about
the person asking 'em..

but often they are not, fundamentally, an accurate critique of
nonmainstream writing....partly for the reasons Howe mentions;  poetry has
many different functions and niches, and should not be imagined as aimed
at a "Common Reader;"

Almost all vital work done in the arts in the last 80 years has a specific
audience, one that is not authorized (as a "mass audience") by the
approval-machinery of the culture bizness;  whether one thinks of Ingmar
Bergman or Robert Wilson or Ornette Coleman.... And the 20th century was
not the only time this has been true, over history.

Mairead,
I don't care if you think it's obnoxious. Survival is
survival. One does what one needs to do in order to
survive. For poor and working class folks survival is
often the name of the game--not "offense." In any case,
you're just trying to turn what I said on its head without
responding to the crux of my point, which I find
obnoxious. Backchannel further, please.
Thank you.

Summi (and all who might be interested) -

Might not be the case any longer, but I know that as recently as last year a
video was available which archived three (?) of Child's 70's and early 80's
works - I remember, in particular, "Mayhem," don't know offhand whether "Is
This What You Were Born For?" was included. The distributor was one commonly
used by Media Studies folks at Buffalo - Anya Lewin would be a good person
to ask. Anya, are you out there?

In any event, if Anya isn't on the list, I'd be happy to forward queries to
her - hesitant as always to give out private e-mail addresses on lists, but
I'd like to help however I can.

Overcautiously yours,
Taylor

monday: i was in the center of the city seeing some friends. people already
start talking about bombing. i heard comment 'we will be occupied as macedonia,
bosnia and croation' didn't comment it. i stop commenting because it doesn’t
have any sense. we all think what we want to think.
thursday: all day spent in front of tv, reading newspapaers and was nervous and
paralyzed.
wednesday: decided do go to visit some friends who work in presses and to give
them new issue of pro femina magazine that appeared few days earlier. on my way
to the center first impression was that the town had very few people on
streets, which is unusual. belgrade is full of people specially because so many
refugees become its citizens, you could hardly walk through streets they were
so full of people and crowded with cars. my friends kept talking about bombing,
about buying enough food. again on streets, i could feel fear in the air.
belgrade was city of ghosts. went to NUNS (office of independent journalist
association, also pro femina is there) met friend who told me about veran matic
(b 92 is publisher of pro femina). all around could feel fear.  in the evening
sirens. we could hear few detonations. spent some time behind tv, but not much
information till 21 hours, then some confused one. during the night sirens, but
we continued to sleep.
saturday: went to downtown. few people on the street. went to buy food twice.
supermarket was full of people who buy food and didn't comment on anything. you
could feel fear on their faces. at night we were in darkness. few detonations
near my husband’s and my place. then we went in bed.
friday: went to downtown. more people on streets, more cars. the atmosphere
calmed. people walked. went to NUNS to pick up the some books. met friends who
spoke about what might happened. at quarter past four heard sirens. jumped into
the bus. look to the people on the street who just continued to walk normally,
back home. all afternoon was on line  with misko replying to friends from
slovenia, croatia, usa that we are ok. friends from belgrade and novi sad
called and we called then. words of courage, and deep worrying. people are
scared how long this could last, what could happen. the experience is that all
our lives are in danger. and i think about people, many of them our friends and
close relatives, in croatia and bosnia during the war... forwarded a message
from friends written by belgrade feminist peace activist lepa mladjenovic .
went to bed around 22. i couldn't sleep, and suddenly detonations. we all went
downstairs, whole city was in darkness. heard detonations for about 20 minutes,
somewhere relatively near us. scared. spent few minutes outside in yard. but
didn't see anything. arround 4 in the morning another siren, one detonation.
continued to sleep.

Mark's absolutely right here - who brings up these questions in most
cases? - highly educated mainstreamers, no? In places like NYTBR, no?  As
evidence to the contrary of this correlation btwn "experimental" and
educated "elite" I'd point to the many poets I know working in various
"poetry in the schools" projects and to one specific example: Susan
Stewart using Harryette Mullen's *Muse & Drudge* in a literacy program and
then having Harryette flown in to read for those students, to great affect
and much fun, I hear.  Elitist?  Hardly.  In contrast, could *anything* be
more alienating to, say, an undereducated, working class person than, say,
Richard Wilbur's "Still, Citizen Sparrow"?  Now *that's* a poem which
requires the full regalia of a long and evil "education."    -m.

this is very interesting. can you mention anyone other than dorothy allison
who seems to you to correspond to the class differences you indicate?  what
about kathy acker?  i'd peg her as a "nice middle class jewish girl" and
she does indeed allude to lots of high-falutin writers in her work, but
it's not exactly smooth.  someone like hejinian i can see ---a number of my
working class students are genuinely mystified by why anyone would want to
write like her or like jane bowles...

The book is called _La Poésie Lettriste_, was published by Seghers in 1974
and is excellent -- a long historico-critical intro on lettrism, followed
by a solid anthology of lettrist texts. The book is most certainly out of
print (unless recently reprinted) but should be available in some
University libraries via Interlibrary loan, if one has an institutional
affiliation.

Is there any validity to considering this a question of who sets the agenda? I
poet's "explanation" of a reality may serve as the context in which a reader
considers the meaning of an "event", even if the reader nd the poet have
diametrically opposede renderings of the same occurence.
By strssing poetry as information, I do not mean to suggest that a poem's
information is the only source. But, given the audience, may be of a limited
power in swaying. Take it further, there are probably poetic productions that
lower their audience's aspirations to advance.

What I mean to suggest is that a poem can impart to occurences their public
persona/character as it transforms a mere happening to a publically
recognizeable event. Along these lines I am thinking of some performances as
the modern replacement of the town crier. Some performances, perhaps more in a
griot tradition, track "fires", reporting on them, while offering help or
initiating criticism as appropriate.

"Theodore Enslin began his artistic career as a musician, trained by Nadia
Boulanger; and the titles of many of his books suggest his continuing
fascination with the "musication" of language: _Etudes, Opus O, Songs w/o
Notes, Carmina, The Diabelli Variations_. Like other poets of his
generation, such as Robert Creeley, Robert Kelly, and Edward Dorn, Enslin
carries forward Charles Olson's sense of the large historical and ethical
function of poetry and his dedication, at once ecopoetic and ethnopoetic,
to place. Also identified with the Objectivist tradition of Louis Zukofsky,
Lorine Niedecker, and George Oppen, he writes about meaning in the
dailiness of human life and the ineluctable reality of the things in this
world."

Well, not Spelling TV, at least.  I confess to more interest in the
translation (or not) of place names, and their spelling and pronunciation.
Shouldn't maps be the same in any language?

How to get to Loyola Marymount:  Go toward the airport, and turn at the giant
donut.  When the street names are the same as the names of famous Jesuits,
you're there.
When the angelus rings eight, the reading is supposed to start.  Try to mill
around looking cool, like you're not waiting for the reading.  I toured around
the business school, and picked up a free bumper sticker being given out by
the Center for Ethics and Business, "More Fun than Decent People Think Should
be Legal!"

While I believe I am more familiar with Peter Gizzi's work than with Elizabeth
Willis', I have her _Human Abstract_ book and none of Peter's books.
Therefore, I was struck by the difference between what I thought while reading
Elizabeth's poems and what I thought hearing them.  I was very interested,
reading, about the religious arguments, but was more interested, listening in
the grey room, about the images of and from visual art.  Ah, Blake, I might
say, had she not read mostly new work that was not from _Human Abstract_.  A
series called "Turneresque" was very enjoyable, and I guess I have to go to
the Getty again, something of a scary religious experience itself, to see
their Richard Dad painting.

Gizzi's emergent thread was Villon and ballads, IMO.

Mairead: In any multi-ethnic, multi-class environment everyone does this
kind of sniffing. When I moved into a largely Irish and Italian
neighborhood in Brooklyn the stoop-sitters very quickly quizzed me and
pronounced me Jewish. There was no malice in it, ever, and I lived there
for close to a decade. What they learned was what category of their
experience I fit into, and my behavior was measured against that norm (and
served to moderate it to some extent) rather than against what would be
expected of an Irishman. It wasn't "What else can you expect from a Jew"
but "He's Jewish, which means that x behavior probably indicates..."
The ability to maintain and apply disparate approximate models of behavior
is a necessary survival skill in cosmopolitan environments. Ethnicity and
class are among other things behavioral languages that often need to be
translated.
My ex-wife, who came from a part of North Carolina where, as she expressed
it, there were three classes: Southern, Mountain, and Black, was always
amazed at my ability (perfectly average for a New Yorker) to arrive at
quick and usually accurate hypotheses about class and origin--her
environment, with its fewer and starker distinctions, hadn't trained her to
do likewise.

I can smell class, they almost fired me for it once.

Survival is survival. Gertrude Stein.

Smell whitey.

Really. Smell has nothing to do with class. The chain bottom of survival
is a process of watching others and knowing your limitations. To
anticipate their next move from the last. To know where things are. Mix
desperation with cool to ask at the right moment.  The right moment has
a lot to do with it. But it is watching and understanding the nature of
the subject until the moment.

Subject:      The Joy of Poetry
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

"Poetry is a calling.  You are called to write and you follow."

Grant kindly requests that I elaborate on what I meant by "the joy of
poetry" when I intimated that the practical implementation of cultural
studies classrooms would have the effect of killing said joy.

Above I quote Susan Howe for my own purposes: For me the joy of poetry--the
phrase bringing to mind big, white-jacketed instruction manuals--has always
been (and I am going to preface everything I say with "For me" so as to
avoid the inevitable universalizing) its quality of given-ness, of temporal
rightness, unavoidableness, inevitibility. As a writer of it and a frequent
reader of it--though not a student of it--I would argue that the reading of
poetry is also a calling, in that there are equivalently inspired moments
of comprehension, agreement, pleasure as occur in the writing. Now, I've
always wondered about critics: what kind of engagement with a poem do you
have to have to write about it (well)? Is it the same kind of feeling of
cohesion? I suppose I've now worked my way around to undermining my first
complaint, about poetry in the classroom, as I guess my tentative answer to
my own question is that critics/students of poetry are not purporting to
engage with the poem as merely writer or reader, but also as worker. Poem
as material with which to make money by writing papers, getting jobs,
getting better jobs? So that the lack of the particular kind of joy I was
referring to would not in the end be such a criminal thing, but an allowed
exigence.

I faintly realize that I am again treading on eggs what with my distinction
here between poem as aesthetic object of transcendent aetheriality and poem
as cultural artifact--But I said "For me."

Here's a response to previous responses. I wrote it a couple of days ago
but had to stay away from the List for a little bit so as not to get an
ulcer.

***

I have decided to try to avoid contention, and so would like to frame most
of my response as sincere (ie, not  rhetorical) questions. I do realize
that some of these questions are naive. I am not an academic but have had
close contact with this world, and find it fascinating. The opinions I
tried to vent in my earlier posting about cultural studies spring out of my
actual practical experience as a student in a classroom such as I have
described, wherein the student body's attempt to guess at what the
professor was hinting at, and her programmatic approach to the reading
list, were depressing and ire-provoking.

It has likewise been pointed out to me that I probably don't really
understand what cultural studies IS or undertakes to be, and my response
again is that I was trying to speak not about the theory but about my
experience of its practice in the actual classroom. I did not mean
(disclaimer, apology) to suggest that I recommend "close reading" as the
only viable means of teaching poetry, nor that those who take joy in
studying poetry through the lens of cultural studies should just stop:
(although I guess I sounded like that's what I meant, and I think that's
just because contention is the most available tone to strike when making
these postings, and that's why I'm going to try to stop after this). I
really was just trying to describe what it was like to be a student
(middle-class or otherwise; that descriptor was a red herring) in such a
classroom at a middle-ground university (also perhaps irrelevant, though if
I had left it out that would be a pretty close reading indeed) and to have
the experience of an attempt at that shift in modalities as I understood it
per the listserv discussion.

Sincere questions:

1) How can the production of increasingly rarified critical papers and
books (a production embedded in and directly spurred by a factory-like
academic industry) be seen to be an agent for social change?

2) How is it materially different for a grad student to write a paper on,
say, Emily Dickinson's love affair with her sister-in-law, and trace its
progress through her poems, than for a grad student to write a paper on
lesbian inter-family relationships in the early part of the century, and
trace the progress of Emily Dickinson's love affair with her sister-in-law
as it is visible in her poems? One seems self-contained, and not purporting
to impact social anything, and the other goes outside literary
circumspection for its points of reference. So is the difference then that
one has the potential to effect social change, and the other doesn't? And
if that potential is not fulfilled, does that alter the quotient of actual
difference between them?

3) OK, so this one's not a question: in response to the relaying of Susan
Howe's interview responses to questions of anti-intellectualism and whether
a given poem needs to be applicable to everyone or just to a few: However
anachronistically, I do continuue to believe that poems, once shot out, are
beyond the control of the poet,  and so the kinds of responses to them that
are had by readers are also out of the poet's control. So if I choose to
read Susan Howe without the benefit of knowing, again, what her husband's
job was, or even knowing how she would LIKE me to read the poems, then
that's mah perogative. And if that makes me not her chosen reader than
that's really OK; I can continue to read her. And if that makes me un- or
anti- intellectual then those are my own unfortunate limitations and I
suppose I am to be pitied rather than despised.

I would also like to suggest that Ms. Howe's response is to be reviewed: I
thought I detected a certain archness which did not in fact indicate
"enragement" over the idea that some readers would not be
qualified/equipped to read her work as she wanted it read, but instead
bemusement that the question should be thrown upon her.  True, I have a
tendency to read archness in often where it is not, but again I suppose
this is harmless, and makes reading--and writing--a whole lot more fun for
me than it otherwise might be.
