The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CRespondings=E2=80=9D by Mart=
in Stannard
Description:=20
=E2=80=9CRespondings=E2=80=9D is the second collection of poet Martin Stann=
ard's reviews and writings about writing, this time selected from pieces pu=
blished between 2004 and 2007. Often controversial and brutally honest, and=
 never courting popularity, Stannard continues to question poets, poetry an=
d himself in an effort to find out whatever there may be to find out. Stann=
ard's writing has often been called "witty and outspoken". Others have just=
 said it's really clever and funny. It's always interesting.

Hi,

In a little over four weeks, to mark our 20th anniversary, we'll be
putting on our fifth annual Welcome to Boog City poetry and music
festival, featuring poets, musicians, and playwrights performing at
four venues, in two boroughs, over five days, from Fri. Aug. 5-Tues.
Aug. 9. Among the over 50 performers taking part are poets Cara
Benson, Charles Borkhuis, Bruce Covey, Alan Gilbert, Brenda Iijima,
Ish Klein, Mark Lamoureux, Tanya Larkin, Douglas Piccininni, Kimberly
Ann Southwick, Mary Austin Speaker, and Jill Stengel.

10 days before the event, we'll be putting out the festival issue of
Boog City. This issue will feature pieces on some of the performers
and a full schedule, illustrated with images of each of the performers.

Advertising in the festival issue of Boog City means you will reach
more than 3,000 readers, poetry lovers, and small press aficionados
throughout the East Village, other targeted areas of lower Manhattan;
Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn; as well as bonus distribution
at Boog City events. That's an increase of 33.3% over our regular
issues for no additional cost. And, since this issue is also a program
for the festival, readers will give it a closer read as they check to
see who's up later on that day and throughout the festival.

Boog City continues to offer our special Small Press Ad Rates. That
means when you advertise with us you will save 50% off of our regular
display ad rates.

      * Full Page        $250
      * Half-Page       $130
      * Quarter-Page   $70
      * Eighth-Page     $40

Here is a link to our full rate card:

http://boogcity.com/ad-rates.pdf

As I mentioned in previous emails to you, Boog City focuses on getting
the word out about lesser-known artists, be they poets, prose writers,
musicians, painters, photographers, or cartoonists. Each month we
publish poetry from the likes of Anselm Berrigan, Renee Gladman, Lisa
Jarnot, Eileen Myles, Kristin Prevallet, and Edwin Torres, alongside
our Urban Folk music section, small press book reviews, political
commentary, art, comics, and photographs.

We look forward to working with you to bring your message to the local
arts community to increase awareness and sales of your publications in
the New York area.

as ever,
David

(Over the Brick Oven Restaurant)

Bantry, west County Cork, Ireland

Dairena N=ED Chinn=E9ide and

Peadar =D3 hUallaigh

with R=F3n=E1n =D3 Snodaigh

Dairena N=ED Chinn=E9ide is an incantatory poet.  Her work is deeply
rooted in the language, folklore and traditions of her native Corca
Dhuibhne, but also pulses with cutting-edge contemporary rhythms.  Her
collections include "M=E1thair an Fhiaigh/The Raven's Mother" and
"Bleachtaire na Seirce."  Tonight she will be accompanied by K=EDla's
lead singer and multi-instrumentalist, R=F3n=E1n =D3 Snodaigh.

Peadar =D3 hUallaigh's "T=EDr Tairngre," winner of the 2010 Rupert and
Eithne Strong Award, is a vision-poet; and he is a unafraid to take a
voyage to the discrete lands of Utopia.  An accomplished traditional
musician, Peadar will also play on the flute tonight.

This bi-lingual reading is curated by Liam Carson, director of the
IMRAM Irish Language Literature Festival.

And then on ...

Wednesday 6 July 2011

1:00 p.m., Lunchtime Reading

at the Bantry Library, Free Admission

Boston Poet Laureate Sam Cornish: The Interview

By Doug Holder


When I lived in Brighton ( a section of Boston) in the 1980=E2=80=99s I u=
sed to see
poet Sam Cornish walking down Commonwealth Avenue. With his thick glasses=
 ,
powerful stride, and intense stare, I thought to myself this cat means
business. I never approached him, but I knew of his reputation as part of=

the =E2=80=9CBoston Underground=E2=80=9D school of poets, and knew he tau=
ght at Emerson
College. It wasn=E2=80=99t until he was appointed to the position of Bost=
on Poet
Laureate did I actually meet him, and now our paths have crossed more tha=
n a
few times. Cornish, 73, was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and for a long t=
ime
commuted between his native city and Boston. He was a poor kid, raised by=

his mother and grandmother after his father died. He was influenced by th=
e
small press movement in poetry, as well as the Black Arts Movement, but
basically he has been viewed as poet who is hard to classify. His poetry
deals with slavery, civil rights, as well as pop culture: from Louie
Armstrong to Frank Sinatra. His poetry is usually stripped down and poten=
t.
Cornish=E2=80=99s breakthrough book of poetry was =E2=80=9CGenerations=E2=
=80=9D published in 1971.
The book is organized into five sections: Generations, Slaves, Family,
Malcolm, and others. He combined his own family with figures from
African-American history. Cornish received a National Endowment for the A=
rts
Award in 1967 and 1969, he was the literature director at the Mass. Counc=
il
of the Arts, and owned a bookstore in Brookline, Mass for a number of yea=
rs.
He has a number of poetry collections under his belt, the most recent: =E2=
=80=9CAn
Apron Full of Beans=E2=80=9D (CavanKerry). I talked with Cornish on my So=
merville
Cable Access TV Show: =E2=80=9CPoet to Poet: Writer to Writer=E2=80=9D

Doug Holder: Sam, you told me that you did not consider yourself to be pa=
rt
of the Black Arts Movement in the 60's and 70's. Yet I have read in a few=

places that people consider you an "unappreciated" figure of the movement=
.
How would you define yourself?

Sam Cornish: What might distinguish me from poets of this generation in t=
he
movement, folks like: Sonia Sanchez, Nikki Giovanni, etc... , was that I =
was
influenced by a number of writers and sources that may not have been part=
 of
the influence and education in the Black Arts Movement. Some of the poets=
 in
the movement came from a conventional negro background. The negro middle
class: doctors, lawyers, teachers. I came from a poor family, raised by m=
y
mother and grandmother. My mother was forced to go on welfare when she co=
uld
no longer work. I went to a neighborhood school and frequented the public=

library.

I bought books and as a result became interested in poetry. The poets tha=
t
moved me were T.S. Eliot, Langston Hughes, prose writers like James T.
Farrell and Richard Wright. As an adolescent I loved Farrell's character =
,
Studs Lonigan. I could identify with him and I was motivated to find othe=
r
books that I could identify with. I read books by George Simeon, the grea=
t
French writer of psychological murder mysteries, for instance.

DH: Who published many of the writers of the Black Arts Movement?

SC: The Broadside Press. It was a small press that was based in Chicago. =
It
was started by a man named Dudley Randall. They were publishing young bla=
ck
writers who were very militant and defined themselves as being "Black"
rather than "Negro." There was a very strong political stance to them.

DH: Didn't you have a strong political slant to your work?

SC: If I did it was politics that grew out of the 1930's. That was a mixt=
ure
of left-leaning, the communist and the socialist.

DH: This was in contrast to the militancy of the 60's?

SC: Yes. Because a lot of that was directed at whites generally. It was
confrontational or abrasive. You were now BLACK and different from previo=
us
generations. You had no patience with your forefathers, your parents, tho=
se
who were living as NEGROES. It was a very angry and self-destructive
ideology. People like James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, and Robert Hayden w=
ere
viewed as not being pro-black.

DH: Your poetry seems to be stripped down rather than weighted with ornat=
e
flourishes.

SC: For me it is a choice of language. How do you describe something? How=
 do
you create a poem? How do you communicate? I would say that it is the
influence of the hard world or the naturalistic writer, where you use the=

language that's employed in common speech. At the same time you recognize=

the lyric possibilities in this language.

I have had my days when I had tons of words on the page. I realized thoug=
h
that it was necessary to use fewer words.

DH: You told me that a poet should reveal something about himself in a po=
em?

SC: I'm back and forth about that. There are poems where you can't find t=
he
poet. There are novels where you can't find the writer. I just feel very
strongly that it is important to present yourself as honestly as you
possibly can. Hold yourself up as a mirror people can see their selves an=
d
vice a versa.

Poetry does provide an opportunity for people to hide themselves behind t=
he
language. They use the poem as a form of escape. And that's OK as a form =
of
entertainment.

DH: You have talked about the photographer Walker Evans, who used to hide=
 a
camera under his coat, and snapped pictures of people that truly captured=

the moment, on the New York subway for instance. Should a poet be Walker
Evans-like?

SC: For me perhaps. But maybe not for others. I like the idea of interact=
ing
with people--different kinds of people.

DH: So you must have been an admirer of the late Studs Terkel?

SC: Very much so. He transcended the genre.

DH: Your breakthrough poetry collection was "Generations" published in 19=
71.
How was it a breakthrough?

SC: It might have been a breakthrough because the number of black writers=

being published at that time were few.The Beacon Press of Boston publishe=
d
it. As a black writer there may have been anger in the book. It was not a=
n
anger directed at White America. It attempted to describe living in an
America that is black and white, and all the other things that go with it=
.
The book is arranged like most of my books are: from past to present. It
begins with a slave funeral and it ends with a sense of Apocalypse. The
history comes from things I heard from home, and things I picked up from =
the
neighborhoods, not to mention popular culture.

DH: We have discussed Alfred Kazin's memoir A Walker in the City. Kazin w=
as
inspired by pounding the pavement on the teeming streets of NYC. How abou=
t
you in Boston?

SC: I used to walk with a pocket camera, and took pictures as I walked. I=

would also walk with a notebook. I would describe things I would see, and=

imagined them as little scenarios. That was an important part of my day.

DH: I get the impression that you are the consummate urban man. Could you=

survive in the country?

SC: If I did live in the country I would like the freedom to move back an=
d
forth. I like to be near theatres, bookstores and cinemas.

DH: You had your own small press: the Bean Bag Press. You hung with small=

press legends like Hugh Fox, and co- edited the anthology: "The Living
Underground: An Anthology of Contemporary American Poetry" ( Ghost Dance
Press: 1969) with him. What is vital about the small press in the literar=
y
milieu?

SC: Publication. The major presses publish very few books of poetry. They=

also have a fixed standard as to what they select. So you often get the s=
ame
voices. The small press allows us to have a variety of voices. It allows =
us
to be challenged, upset, disturbed and sometimes angered by what we read.=

The major press' books are pleasant and fun to read. But they are not
disturbing. They are basically not truthful. The small press has novelty,=

surprise, can be violent, and sometimes it can be damn good poetry.

DH: What are your goals in your position of Boston Poet Laureate?

SC: Right now I am available for people through the library and also thro=
ugh
Mayor Menino's office. If people call and request my presence at a school=
 or
senior citizen's center, or where people would like a poet, I go. I try t=
o
be the person to bring a poem to people who might not read poetry, or tho=
se
who want to talk to a poet about the craft.

a question.

a friend of mine is writing a story set 30,000 years ago. the characters are
of that time. i noticed that he has them use number language that they
certainly didn't possess. Like 'count to ten and then do this' (they almost
certainly couldn't count) and they occassionally say things like 'there must
be 400 reindeer' (they probably only had words for numbers up to maybe four.
probably they referred to large groups with terms like 'herd' rather than
specifically numbering them, and they might have had number words like
'pair', or a 'brace of pheasants', stuff like that).

what i'm looking for are papers/books on the specific language used by
'primitive' people specifically concerning number. so that my friend can use
similar number language.

ideally, there's a paper out there that looks at the specific language used
by one or more specific tribes concerning number.

looking at the net and my book by dantzig on number, it's a bit vague
concerning the specific language used, and its range. this could be remedied
if there's a study out there of the specific language used by one or more
specific tribes. anybody know of any such studies?

Subject:      rob's new editing service: poetry manuscript reading, editing,
              evaluation

For a few years now, I've offered a one-on-one poetry editing/evaluation
service, and have decided to expand.

I'm currently offering, to anyone interested, evaluation, editing
and otherwise help with shaping a poetry manuscript for potential publication.
I'd be thinking a series of back-and-forths, including notes, questions
and revisions. $200 for a manuscript up to 100 pages, or $250 for up to
150 pages.

If you are interested, send me an email at rob_mclennan@hotmail.com.

It has been a while since I've run poetry workshops at Collected Works
Bookstore and Coffeebar, but I've run nearly a dozen poetry workshops at
the store over the past decade, and run other workshops and manuscript
evaluations through my Writer-in-Residence position at the University of
Alberta (2007-8), through Encounters with Canada, and as part of the
(late, lamented) Ottawa Valley Book Festival, as well as editing numerous
books over the years for Broken Jaw Press, Vehicule Press, Insomniac Press
and Black Moss Press, and my own Chaudiere Books and above/ground press.

There's always a possibility that I might offer another poetry workshop.
Keep an eye either on http://www.robmclennan.blogspot.com or
http://www.bywords.ca/ for future announcements

Dear friends,

We want to sell 100 copies of Versal 9 by August 1! Yes yes yes! And you
can help!

http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=224305094268346

You basically have three options. Help, help more, or ignore this
completely (we might be crazy, but we're also realistic). Check the
Facebook event page for complete details. Or just order your copy of
Versal 9 here: http://www.wordsinhere.com/orderversal.html

Because funding for the literary arts is dying all over the place, so we
have to find ways to support ourselves.

Because we have a fantastic thing you can buy that will fund us
fantastically.

Because we're in love with Versal and we want to share that love.

Because 55 writers, poets, artists and everything put something truly
great in Versal 9's pages.

Please share this, tweet this, etc. this and help us reach our goal. 100
sales of Versal 9 equals half our printing bill!

Many, many thanks for supporting the literary arts wherever and whenever
you can.

Best,
Megan

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is "Inshore Seeds" by William Allegrezza.
Description:
"Inshore Seeds" by William Allegrezza is split into four sections.  The first section explores the intersection of language, meaning, identity, politics, and inconsistency, and the second reveals poetry as news articles without the news. The third section takes on the prose poem, and the fourth section plays with the dual image of kern from typography and military history, as if poetry is called to both.

I'm looking for a student intern to assist me this summer with final
production details of my Robert Duncan biography. This would include
research, fact checking and sorting files. The book will be out in
February so i'm in a mad rush to tie up final details.  My funds are
limited but I can compensate with books and poetry tutorials.  I can
be reached at ljarnot@gmail.com.  Thanks all, Lisa Jarnot

Rachel Aydt is a writer and assistant professor at The New School =20
University, where she teaches magazine journalism. She=92s worked on =20
staff at magazines for nearly two decades, including American =20
Heritage, Cosmopolitan, and CosmoGirl. Now she works from home (or =20
from any cafe that has electrical sockets and bottomless cups of =20
coffee), and she=92s a regular contributor of essays and features to The =

=95
When I was 18 years old I was reading poetry at an open mic night at =20
the QE2 on Central Avenue in Albany. That year, I was getting my B.A. =20=

from SUNY Albany, but what I was mostly doing was swinging 300 =20
burritos on a busy night at El Loco Mexican Cafe. Or hanging out at =20
Justin's on a flush night; Palais Royale on not such a flush night. =20
Come to think of it, this seems like a time when drinks were rarely =20
bought; they were just doled out and fueling general mayhem up and =20
down Lark Street.

In the audience at the QE2 were two stand-up young men named Rod =20
Sperry and David Kirschenbaum. They liked my poetry a lot, they said. =20=

They were starting a press=97what would become Boog Literature=97and =
they =20
wanted to publish a chapbook of my work. I wanted to date Rod, and so =20=

I said yes. That=92s not why I said yes, but the synergy of the xeroxing =
=20
of stapled chapbook days certainly helped to fuel a crush, and David =20
and Rod have remained stalwart friends and supporters for the last 20-=20=

plus years. My chapbook was titled A Canopy Sack of Details. I write =20
mainly nonfiction narratives now. I'd love to believe that not-so-=20
buried in each of these are bits of poetry emerging; it=92s a calling =20=

that seems to transform and reemerge at the most unexpected times and =20=

for the strangest reasons.

**Sean Cole http://www.shampoopoetry.com/shampoothirtyeight/cole.htm
Sean Cole is a public radio reporter and poet living in New York, =20
hailing from Boston, and formerly of Toronto. He's proud to be a long-=20=

standing member of the Boog family, beginning with his first chapbook, =20=

"By the Author," which came out so long ago he's forgotten the year.
=95
Who is this bouyant, Ted-Berrigan-sized, yarmulked guy at Aaron =20
Kiely=92s Boston Alternative Poetry Conference in 1998? I mean the one =20=

behaving (maybe overly so?) as though anything=92s possible. I mean the =20=

guy who sat on the publishing panel, with a bone folder and long-armed =20=

stapler, assembling chapbooks before our eyes=97chapbooks for which he=92d=
 =20
gathered the poems one day prior. When you meet someone who will be =20
your friend and collaborator for life, there=92s a hair of a second when =
=20
you know it. You don=92t know, necessarily, he=92ll be the first person =
to =20
mass-produce your poems. Nor that he=92ll one day send you 31 self-=20
addressed stamped postcards and demand a month of daily poems because =20=

he thinks you=92re not writing enough (because you aren=92t). Nor that =
you =20
will fight, for days, about whether it=92s unseemly to name a Boog =20
Literature volume Erections. I mean when you first lay eyes on him, =20
you don=92t even know his name. But there=92s an instant when, =20
inexplicably, you=92re already grateful for his unaccountable belief in =20=

you, for his tirelessly shepherding so many nutso poets into print, =20
for driving around New York delivering hundreds of free Boog City =20
issues to bars and caf=E9s. There=92s just a moment when you flash on =20=

that. And then it passes. And he sticks out his hand and says, =93Hi! =20=

http://www.myspace.com/crabsonbanjo
Crabs on Banjo is an experimental, improvisational musical act =20

Ben Krieger and Brian Speaker. Rarely will you find a more potent =20
combination of class and crass.

**Crazy and the Brains
http://www.myspace.com/crazyandthebrains
Punk Rock meets the Stone Age, Crazy and the Brains will have you =20
singing, dancing, and fist pumping to catchy grooves and fun lyrics. =20
They really do just =93Wanna Be On Saturday Night Live,=94 and with =
great =20
hooks, it wouldn=92t surprise me if they eventually were. Downstroke =20
guitars and xylophone makes them sound like The Ramones meet The =20
Violent Femmes.
=95
The self-described =93newest band in NYC=94 is a modern-day Ramones, =
with =20
lyrics so dumb they have to be smart (or so one hopes). "I don't want =20=

to do anything I don't like. I just wanna be on Saturday Night Live,=94 =20=

they artlessly state on a track from their self-titled EP, with no =20
evident irony and more energy than any amount of Ritalin could =20
control. You can see the live video at Youtube, along with loads of =20
other clips that showcase their sound.

The band's not-so-secret weapon is Jeff Rubin, the nominal Brains of =20

Veranda of The Grand Gables (excerpt)

disagreement with a =93real world=94 that is by comparison brutal and =20=

Thanks to Anne Waldman for allowing Chax Press to
print Feminafesto. This book was printed and sewn in
105 to 110 degree heat in late June and early July 2011
in our Tucson, Arizona studio, with fans blowing from
two directions on the printer at the Vandercook Press.
Type, wood type, and polymer plates were all used in
the printing process. Charles Alexander completed
the bulk of the printing, with valuable assistance from
Johann Martinez. The cuts used as visual information
in the book have been re-purposed from original work
by Sonia Telesco and Cynthia Miller. All papers used
were found under the main table in our studio, and
include Bristol for covers and Mohawk Superfine for
text. Type is Goudy Old Style and a wood type given to
us by friends.
160 numbered copies and about 10 lettered artist=92s
proof copies, and the copy you are now reading is [the number]

Dear SPD:

You have long provided a valuable service.  You have responded quickly
to changing technology in some measure, and so have been able to
support the burgeoning numbers of small press publishers in the
technology changes that make more and more great books possible to
make.

Please at your earliest convenience start supporting digital (.pdf,
kindle, MP3, whatever) downloads, and/or conversion for our books to
that format for vending. Some of us who know how to do that are
willing to help with specifications and processes at least.

Additionally, can SPD openly consider -- perhaps debate -- used book
sales a la half.com/eBay or Amazon (and Borders' original business
model -- one which abandoning caused the corporation to fail?)?

I have lots of thoughts on this last bit.  But if it is a profit
center for Amazon, was for Borders (and many independent bookstores
still), why not small presses?

All best,

As part of the 100,000 Poets for Change event on September 24, I will be
recording my friends, family and colleagues as well as new and inspiring
voices reading their own or their favorite poems for a website that will be
developed in the late summer. This is all in lieu of a grand project Doug
Mowbray and I are developing as a poetry non-profit, which will include an
extensive small press library and a network of teachers, poets and community
leaders.

The project is simple: record the voices of all who find in poetry a means
to understand themselves and their environment, and to to develop a
sustainable community ethic wherein creative literacy is at the forefront of
civility and compassion.

Anyone in the Baltimore area is invited to join in this project. If you'd
like to help with any facet of this experiment, be it recording or editing
audio/video for our website (tba), of if you'd like to read your favorite
poems, please contact me at furniture.press.books@gmail.com.

Cheers!

Dear Catherine,
We always love when a question can be answered with, "Ask and you
shall receive!" SPD is in fact now able to offer digital formats of
books. and you will see our very first e-titles available very soon
(the actual files are being created right now). Because of the way
that e-readers (like Kindle and iPads, for example) work, you will
actually download most digital SPD titles directly through your
particular device, but the books will indeed be from SPD. As for used
books, unfortunately we simply don't have a warehouse with the space
to house used books. It's also an issue (and something worthy of
discussion by all who buy used books) that used book sales generate no
profit for either publishers or authors (that only happens when a book
is initially sold). So, while as readers ourselves we certainly love
used books and would certainly prefer buying them through an entity
like SPD, it wouldn't make sense for our business model (practical
matters of space aside). For now, we hope that the digital books we
will soon be providing will be welcome by SPD readers and that this
might become a terrific way for many of the titles we make available
to be available long beyond their traditional print runs. As you
probably know, for now, ebook formats are not particularly friendly to
poetry or other types of writing where things like line breaks are
integral to a text, but there are a number of solutions on the near
horizon. We look forward to being able to offer a considerable number
of SPD titles in digital formats in the very near future. As for print
books, as long as readers keep buying them, publishers can keep
producing them. Digital or print, long live the book!
All best,
The folks at SPD

Description:
Harmonia is the immortal goddess of concord and harmony. Despite the cheeri=

 it. More happily: harmonia is the natural state of being of all living thi=
ngs, according to Plato; it=E2=80=99s a genus of beetles, and of weeds, a p=

ns from all these juxtaposed things, it is also the title of this collectio=

.

Here's a little review I wrote of four new HTML 5 works:
http://netartery.vispo.com/?p=1061

HTML 5 is touted as an open source replacement of the proprietary Flash. I
talk about that a bit and then look at four interesting art works created
with HTML 5.

A brief description of the first two pieces reviewed:

Chris Milk and The Arcade Fire, the Montréal band who won a Grammy for best
album this year with The Suburbs, have produced an excellent interactive
alternative to the music video that I review and link to.

Some dudes from France, Maxime Simon and Pete, have produced quite a
remarkable online game called Canvas Rider totally with HTML 5. The look of
this game is perhaps the most remarkable thing about it. Very unusual and
hand drawn. That and its ability to run fullscreen very smoothly. And the
way that kids have responded to the ability for them to create new skins or
maps for the game with their own pencil drawings.

Catherine, I worked for Borders for a number of years, and to my
knowledge, the resale of used books was not something that they ever
got involved in (unless this happened after 2000). Unless you mean the
original Borders store in Ann Arbor - perhaps they engaged in the sale
of used books, but I hardly think that contributed to their downfall
as a corporation.

Best,

Dan

Description:

Of =E2=80=9CCountry Without a Name=E2=80=9D, Morgan Harlow writes: =E2=80=
=98Ann Bogle=E2=80=99s latest collection of memoir fiction, is a sequence o=
f thoughts, dreams and conversations. Here white petunias are cut with scis=
sors to make a name, values are placed as if they were tarot cards, and app=
roximations of the sublime are revealed in mathematical detail. =E2=80=9CCo=
untry Without a Name=E2=80=9D recalls the work of Dada poet Tristan Tzara (=
whose name means =E2=80=9Ccountry=E2=80=9D in Romanian) and the semi-autobi=
ographical pharmaceutical quests and cut-up text collages of William S. Bur=
roughs. Bogle rebels, defines and ultimately defies hierarchies. Her writin=
g, manifesto-like, hints at what might have been learned from Andre Breton=
=E2=80=99s Nadja if we had been given her diary to read, along with the ide=
a that non-being dwells in language the same as being does, or in Bogle=E2=

MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Possibly useful blogpost:

http://mollybackes.blogspot.com/2011/07/how-to-be-writer.html

For my own students I retell a story I've heard about the now unread
Sinclair Lewis, a wretchedly unhappy man and a prolific but not very
good novelist who nevertheless did some good in his own time as a social
satirist. After Lewis became the first American to win the Nobel Prize
in literature (1930), an attempt was made to turn him into a respectable
man of letters -- not a particularly promising idea, because he was a
stone alcoholic. Nevertheless, after he returned from Stockholm there
did come an invitation to address the students at Columbia. The
auditorium there was large and full, but when Lewis took the stage he
turned out to be seriously drunk.

He stumbled over to the lectern and made the effort to focus on the
eager faces before him. Then he spoke.

"You want to be writers?" he asked. "Well then, God damn it, write."

And then he stumbled back off the stage and went to sleep.

I have no idea whether that story is true. Of course it's only a
retelling of an ancient adage that exists in several versions -- for
instance, the admonition _nulla dies sine linea_. But the advice is wise
wherever it comes from, don't you think?

fact that they were stolen, or from the fact that they came from Fada's
backyard -- from "owere Fada" -- or both. Maybe if we had been allowed to
harvest them freely, they wouldn't have been so tasty after all! Forbidden
things are always very attractive."

Rotary House / Nathaniel Vincent Mohatt

Author's Introduction: "In 2005 my father was diagnosed with Chronic
Lymphocytic Leukemia, and in 2008 I spent two weeks with him at MD
Anderson in Houston, staying at the Rotary House International Hotel
attached to the cancer center. During this stay I began to awake to a
deeper understanding of my father's illness, in particular the very real
threat it presented, my anger and fear towards the disease, and the
important but limited role that health care could play. Through reflecting
on this experience I have come to see health care, like art, as being
defined by the attempt, the process of trying to attain without the
ability to realize perfection. These poems weave together visions from the
MD Anderson trip, scientific articles, and pieces of my family's life
after my father's death two years later with a variety of images,
memories, characters, and spirits. The poems often begin with scenes and
people from MD Anderson, but the experiences they revolve around encompass
visions beyond my direct relationship with cancer, science, and health
care. I hope that through my art I can come to convey some of this
emotion, this swirl, this rotary." NVM

Author's Note: Nathaniel Vincent Mohatt is a postdoctoral fellow at Yale
where he researches community arts in behavioral health services. He holds
a PhD in Creative Writing and Community Psychology from the University of
Alaska Fairbanks and an MFA in poetry from Saint Mary's College of
California. His dissertation portrays a family's experience of cancer care
through poetry and essay, while his research and professional work has
largely been focused on Native American cultural psychology and health
promotion. He is a co-founder of the Pirate Pig Press, a community arts
promotion extravaganza based out of California. The intertwining of poetry
and the arts with community well-being and cultural resiliency are at the
root of his work both as a poet and a scientist. He was raised on the
Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation in South Dakota and in Fairbanks Alaska,
and he is married with two young daughters. He has been published in
scientific and literary journals, including MiPOesias, Big Bridge, Jack
Magazine, Camas, BorderSenses, and Literary House Review.

In *ECSTATIC/.of facts* Raymond Farr brilliantly investigates the
relationship between language, meaning and culture by vividly demonstrating
how language can shape worlds. In an insightful and stimulating journey,
Farr takes an intense and often playful walk through landscapes of
significance in which we are faced with the =93Onslaught of language,=94 on=
ly to
find that the =93amber light of meaning stares back.=94 To discover meaning=
 in
something as =93fundamental as chaos,=94 we need go no further than America=
n
suburban culture of generic mega stores, chain restaurants, popular music
and blockbuster movies. Reframing these ubiquitous icons in discursive
language results in an effect rather like =93Marcel Duchamp=85singing songs=
 once
sung by Doris Day.=94

Things are not, Farr shows us, as they seem =96 the daily reality we
experience is not the only reality. With an astute sense of phrasing and
rhythm, Raymond Farr explores the interplay of language and culture by
taking us through =93all possible versions of a straight line=94 to learn t=
hat
there is =93a cubicle in a circle after blue skies on Saturday night.=94 We=
 are
urged to take linguistic responsibility for the structure of the present
instance through being reminded that, =93We are the consequence of cause &
affect,=94 and that only =93moments ago there was the illusion of nothing.=
=94

The dialectical =93I=94 in these poems is our collective aloneness in the d=
esert
of constant traffic noise. Despite our need to belong, we are ultimately
alone, members only of ourselves. Overwhelmed by the lies we tell ourselves
to make the terror of existence bearable, our lives become =93a dream we dr=
eam
to the end of the world.=94 Farr invites us to strip away all pretence so w=
e
can listen closely to the amorphous flux of the real, where perhaps we will
hear =93the prayers of angels being answered in the dark,=94 and glimpse th=
e
inner heart where =93answers are vague=94 and the =93only true conclusion, =
we
conclude, is always inconclusiveness.=94 In the end, we have only our shado=
ws
to lose. =97*John C. Goodman*, author of *naked beauty* and editor of ditch



No new cities are being built. That arrangement is palimpsest. Boroughs
carved by a metonymy. And oscillation. One may artery about thing, about a
place, or both. Each fact is a tenement to situation a place from which
oscillations are discerned.  *ECSTATIC/.of facts* courses within this
layout, and Farr engages in no liminal simplification charting arrays of
snarl. =97*Matthew Johnstone*, author of *Let=92s be close Rope to mast, yo=
u Old
light*



Cold, hard facts:  not!  As Raymond Farr demonstrates in this wonderful new
collection, facts are the serendipity of the real.  Farr takes sentences an=
d
fragments, and he builds tenements of facts from the sky downward.  His gif=
t
to readers is a city of the materiality of language and of what is
absolutely, astonishingly material to life.  In Farr=92s words, =93The fact=
s are
convincing. I am one hungry carnivore.=94 =97*Joel Chace*

As part of the 100,000 Poets for Change event on September 24, I will be
recording my friends, family and colleagues as well as new and inspiring
voices reading their own or their favorite poems for a website that will be
developed in the late summer. This is all in lieu of a grand project Doug
Mowbray and I are developing as a poetry non-profit, which will include an
extensive small press library and a network of teachers, poets and communit=
y
leaders.

The project is simple: record the voices of all who find in poetry a means
to understand themselves and their environment, and to to develop a
sustainable community ethic wherein creative literacy is at the forefront o=
f
civility and compassion.

Anyone in the Baltimore area is invited to join in this project. If you'd
like to help with any facet of this experiment, be it recording or editing
audio/video for our website (tba), of if you'd like to read your favorite
poems, please contact me at furniture.press.books@gmail.com.

Cheers!

Tomas: Let us know if your appeal nets more results. Part of the ongoing de=

from "The poem as a type of activism"=20
A review of "War Rug" by Steve Halle

"Politically charged investigation raises the stakes of poetry for both =
the poet (as producer) and the poem (as art object). This type of poetry =
not only invokes the bardic practice of speaking the wisdom of the =
group, but also uses the poem as a type of activism. When critics =
question the role of poetry in the real world or what it can accomplish =
outside of its own existence, activist poetics that enters conversation =
with contemporary political happenings offers one of the better =
answers."=20

Notes on Torture & Survival

six feet by ten feet
wider than a lead coffin
no natural light

sometimes only darkness
a punishment for surviving
so many shades of black

or weeks of  light bulb
days have no rhythm but howls
torture knows no clocks

twenty three hours
every day alone boxed
one hour to breathe wind

will a cloud drift by
a patch of summer blue sky
a black bird's feather

perhaps tomorrow
arc of sun will show itself
kiss your skin  golden

Thanks Steve... feel free to submit any material you want, opinons, article=
s, poems, Haiku etc... a journal is as relevent as its contributors and its=
 readership, if it has a small circulation of a readership that are interes=
ted in it, its highly relevent, but a big readership who are not interested=
 in it is not.

Big fish in small pond and all that!!!!

It is hoped to develop a journal for all forms of poetry - the oft nowadays=
 neglected traditional rhyming scheme, the second section is inteded to be =
for haiku and the last section for free verse, with scattered through artic=
les and photos and explorations in images in poetry and poetry inspired by =
images and so forth...

Hope you enjoy it, if you or anyone else would like to do a review of it fr=
om your angle that would be cool as well...

Snowstorm of Doubt & Grace
Ken and Triona Hume.
ISBN: 978-1-908282-87-3
http://originalwriting.ie/bookshop/poetry/snowstorm-of-doubt-and-grace/

As featured in the latest issue of the Cartys Poetry Journal, Ken and Trion=
a Humes book "Snowstorm of Doubt and Grace" has been published and is set t=
o be launched in the Wolftrap in Tullamore on the 23rd of July by the Count=
y Offaly Arts Officer Sin=C3=A9ad O'Reilly.

The book consists of two parts, Snowstorm of Doubt are Kens poems and lyric=
s, and reflect his vision of the world, view of the world, expressed in the=
 written word, incorporating every writers feelings of doubt that their wor=
k is good enough, famously expressed by the Czech Yiddish writer Franz Kafk=
a who requested after his death that his freind should "Burn them all, the =
words that I have written".

The world is a richer place that his request was not granted - that itself =
inspired a poem from myself seen on Youtube - and so it is with Ken, the ac=
tive encouragement both of his mother Triona and freinds such as Anthony Su=
llivan, and Id suppose myself!!!! - hence the title of his section of the b=
ook.

His mother is seen by him as being a graceful person - sure we all think th=
at of the Irish mammy!!! - hence the title of the section that comprises he=
r writings, a collection of prose section and poems, my favourite of which =
was J'espirit. She has published a couple of chapbooks over the years and n=
urtured her sons intrest in the arts.

All too often we see writers who are full of themselves and their belief in=
 their own abilities, and whill thats all grand in its own way, its good to=
 see a writer comfortable and humble enough to express the doubts in their =
own abilities and who strive to connect with the reader as opposed to deman=
ding that the reader connect with and understand them.

The book costs approx =E2=82=AC10 and is avaialable from Irish POD form Ori=
ginal Writing.

Has there ever been a peer-reviewed Literary journal? In other words, =
submissions are sent out to other writers who then recommend whether or =
not the magazines publish the work?

The reason I ask is:  some scientist friends were telling me that with =
journals such as Science and Nature, there's a lot of editorial personal =
taste involved. In other words it's not just about whether or not an =
article is important, but if the editors "like" the research.=20

I suggested that with literary periodicals it's the same in the sense =
that a lot of the submitted writing or poetry is very good and =
ultimately it's editors personal taste (reading) which determines what =
is selected.=20

Somehow while I was explaining this, I gave my friends the impression =
that literary journals were peer-reviewed, in the same way that =
scientific journals are. While I was explaining that lit mags are not =
peer-reviewed, but have permanent editors, it occurred to me that =
perhaps it has been done before.

Carlos Soto-Rom=E1n writes from the center of Empire with a sense of play
(game pieces included) and clinical examination.* Philadelphia's Notebooks*=
 is
the work of an artist/world citizen who critiques the daily interrogations
that come with being a new immigrant. The fun fact that Ellis Island was
greatly expanded with landfill in the late 19th -early 20th century provide=
s
a basis for Soto-Rom=E1n's signage marking poetry's place in a disposable
culture. There are workbook exercises that encourage creative ways to answe=
r
the calls for loyalty oaths with a demand for radical possibility the host
country includes in its PR material. This work also includes what the USA
brand doesn't advertise=97isolation and moments of utter despair. It is a
truly American poem in that it's internationally inflected, from George
Perec to German cinema to self-immolators from all over the world.
*Philadelphia's
Notebooks* could not be a more artful and timely reminder that =93Every hea=
rt
is a revolutionary cell.=94=97*Frank Sherlock*

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CMother Earth=E2=80=9D by Ada=
m Fieled=20
Description:=20
Normal people tend to figure out what (and who) they want through relations=
hips. Poetry in 2011 doesn=E2=80=99t always need to deal with the exalted, =
the archetypal, or (as is the case with post-modern poetry) the conditions =
and contexts of language itself. Poetry that configures the extraordinary t=
hrough the normal is useful because it has utility value for an audience, l=
argely middle and working class, that is being challenged by threatening ex=
ternal conditions, economic and otherwise. =E2=80=9CMother Earth=E2=80=9D i=
s an ordinary story with some pertinent implications; if it is read with un=
derstanding, it can function as allegory and its relationships stand as rep=
resentations of the larger trends currently shaping our world.

ive had creative work peer reviewed before ..

by uts review (now cultural studies review) - not quite - as its name sugge=
sts - a literary journal

there was a creative writing journal called 'strange' at the university of =
melbourne which i think claimed to be the first peer reviewed purely creati=
ve journal

& i know we started the process when i was an editor for a postgrad journal=
 called antithesis - but i have a feeling we may not have had the poetry pe=
er reviewed in the end=2C but i think the stories were..

(status claims aside) it makes sense to peer review essays when it mightnt =
be the field of the editor - but if theres a poetry editor i dont see the p=
oint in peer reviewing poetry - it cd be an admission of limited capability

seeking interns for our 2011 =96 2012 season. Join our team of three editor=
s
in putting together the 2012 issue of *Monday Night*! This is an opportunit=
y

Please note =96 this is an *unpaid* internship but offers all kinds of
resume-boosting activities and general merriment.



*Time commitment & schedule:* We are looking for interns who can commit *at
a minimum* from September 2011 to March 2012. (If you wish to participate i=
n

available through June or July 2012.) September =96 December is our annual
reading period, so we will all be reading submissions from November 2011 to
early January 2012. We will have regular check-in gatherings for the editor=

m
January to March, we will have a series of editorial meetings to review the
work and make our selections. Other activities may include proofreading eac=
h

from contributors, and other miscellany.

   - Special projects may be available, time permitting

   your work by the deadline, you can make your own schedule.
   - Work with other cool writers =96 make friends!
   - Extra coolness in your life via your association with *Monday Night*!



*What are we looking for?*

   - Enthusiasm (reading submissions is not glamorous work but it can be
   amusing and/or educational).
   - Ability to sift through many pieces of writing without an excess of
   mercy and ability to trust your own judgment to find the best work.
   - Ability to use online social media and email communications. Commitmen=
t

Dear friends & colleagues,

Thought this might interest you, not only for the collaboration I did
with the work of the UK painter Jane Joseph, but also because this is a
very interesting site for news on the art world and because many poets
have also appeared in collaborations here under the guidance of David
Cohen, editor, and Bill Berkson as poetry editor.  Here's the link to my
collaboration, from which you can navigate to the entire site:

In "It Won't Work," the latest in our essay series, we republish a
piece by Don McKay on the 25th anniversary of Brick Books in 2000,
and the temerity of its founders despite naysayers and obstacles.
Brick Books was founded in 1975 and I, as an avid reader of Canadian
literature and particularly of books by Brick, am very glad they are
here and thriving. Please visit their wonderful site

Hey All - This Saturday July 30 in Chinatown I'll be premiering The Saffron
Green, a piece I did in collaboration with Geneva Skeen and with a number of
great performers and musicians... We'll be on rooftops, hanging out of
windows etc etc
I hope you can come and see, hear, experience the The Saffron Green with us
best

The Saffron Green

A Space Opera in three movements written for voice, walkie talkie, megaphone
and radio composed by Geneva Skeen and Mathew Timmons (radio score by
Garrick Hogg, Andrew Lessman and Max Mayer). Employing a minimal modular
score The Saffron Green brings together multiple analog technologies to
explore the concept of both an outer space opera and an opera in space.
Taking the structure of a space opera and bringing it to street level, The
Saffron Green borrows liberally from sci-fi operatic soundscapes and matches
it with protest chants from the "Arab Spring" revolts. The People Want to
Topple, The People Want to Overthrow, The People Demand the Fall. The
performance will extend throughout Chinatown, using Human Resources as a
staging ground and as home base from 5:30-7:00 pm and culminating on, in and
above Chung King Road performed by a group of roughly 35 people from
7:15-7:45 pm. You are invited to see The Saffron Green, the performance
before the performance, the staging of the work as a work in and of itself
at Human Resources from 5:30-7:00 pm as the performers ready themselves, get
into costume, tune their radios, ready the walkie talkies and the bullhorns
and warm up their voices. Then join us in walking over to Chung King Road
for the performance from 7:15-7:45 pm for Perform Chinatown! on July 30.



Performers: Geneva Skeen, Mathew Timmons, Garrick Hogg, Kim Calder, Claire
Cronin, Greg Curtis, Andrea Dominguez, Kate Durbin, Rafa Esparza, Matt
Fielder, Kate Gilbert, Gabi Gutierrez, Leah Harmon, Michael Anthony Ibarra,
Mandy Kahn, Joanne Mitchell, Tayor Murphy, Carmel Ni, Leila Perry, Jon
Rutzmoser, Yecenia Torres, Christine Werthiem, and more...

Please mark your calendars for this August 4th Dusie Kollektiv event. We
hope to see you there.
http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=135592276525449

The Zinc Bar welcomes
Dusie Press/the Dusie Kollektiv
(Switzerland)

Thursday, August 4, 5:30 p.m. sharp (doors open 5-ish)
Zinc Bar: 82 West 3rd Street (btw Thompson & Sullivan), Greenwich Village,
New York
Free & Open to the Public

Featuring readings from:

Cara Benson
Maria Damon
Amanda Deutch
Jennifer K. Dick
Greg Fuchs
Susana Gardner
Becca Klaver
Deborah Poe
Marthe Reed
Michael Ruby
Kathrin Schaeppi
Jill Stengel
Vincent Zompa

Curated by Dusie Kollektiv members Amanda
Deutch, Deborah Poe and Vincent Zompa.

The Dusie Kollektiv is a group of international poets who each produced
their own chapbooks for distribution among the kollektiv members. Many
editors published their chapbook under the name of a small press with which
they are already affiliated; some created small presses just for the
kollektiv. The point with the various names of press was to reify ownership
and flood the market with new presses.

Each year is different for the kollektiv, as every year there are different
participants. With that said, there are many loyal kollektiv members who
have been with the project since the first year. The project focuses more on
process and risk, and writers have no inhibition regarding publishing as it
is a completely open platform and all works get published. Also, the group
exchange gives an extra push in way of timeline and production, which also
motivates creation.

Hi,

or more of their authors to read (we=92ve had as many as 10 for one =20
press and usually have 3-6) for 60 minutes total. We also have a =20
musical act perform two 15-minute sets. If the visiting press is able =20=

to book the musical act that=92s preferred, so it=92s truly their night, =
=20
if not I can book one that I think will work well with the night. =20

One Hundred Thousand Poets for Change

* *

Thousand Poets For Change=94 Truly Historic***

* *

Poets around the world are currently organizing and planning nearly 400
individual events to take place simultaneously on September 24th in a
demonstration/celebration of poetry and the spoken word to promote
environmental, social, and political change.



In Baltimore City, I am organizing a massive recording session of area
poets, writers and readers, and then creating a free online anthology where
anyone in the world can listen. The purpose is to support the notion that
=93The City that Reads=94 reflects the manifest interests and poetics of it=
s
citizenry, and that creative literacy can be sustained in Charm City.



From now until September 24th, I=92ll be reaching out to individuals to rea=
d
their favorite poems in front of a microphone. It can be one poem or a
series of poems. The object is to show the world that poetry is thriving in
our fair city and that it=92s not just practicing or well-known poets and
writers who are engaged in the craft.



Immediately following September 24th, all documentation on the 100TPC.org
weblog will be preserved by Stanford University in California, which has
recognized 100 Thousand Poets for Change as an historical event, the larges=
t
poetry reading in history. They will archive the complete contents of the
weblog, 100TPC.org, as part of their digital archiving program
LOCKSS<http://www.lockss.org/lockss/Home>
.



So, want your 15 minutes of fame? Let=92s meet! You can find my contact inf=
o
below. Please write or call me to set up a time where we can meet. All you
have to do is pick your favorite poems and tell us a little about yourself.



Thank you,

Dear friends and colleagues (with apologies for duplicates),

Thought this might interest you, not only for the collaboration I did
with the work of the UK painter Jane Joseph, but also because this is a
very interesting site for news on the art world and because many poets
have also appeared in collaborations here under the guidance of David
Cohen, editor, and Bill Berkson as poetry editor. Here's the link to my
collaboration, from which you can navigate to the entire site:
http://artcritical.com/2011/07/23/michael-heller-jane-joseph-2/ .

Subject:      Orality and Art: Hitting the Sweet Spot in Performance
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

John Miles Foley's How to Read an Oral Poem (U. of Illinois Press), is a
great book that presents some useful takes on Ong & Co.,--also recommend
his Oral Lit. website.

Foley starts the book off with a picture (on the cover of an earlier
edition) of Grags-pa send-ge, an oral epic singer from the Chando area
of the Tibetan Autonomous region of China.  In Grags-pa send-ge's hand
is a piece of paper at which he appears to be staring as he "reads"
the epic.  The interesting point is this: the paper is blank, yet all
epic singers from this area hold paper as part of the performance.
Indeed, the blank page is a kind of "centering" device, or even, if
you will, an aid to visualization as the words roll forth.  This perhaps
is an extreme example, but one that brings up a question:

When you give a "reading" of your work, how do you fill the gap to hit
the sweet spot, as it were, between text and performance?  Do you
attempt to be true to the text before you, or do you use the text as a
platform for improvisation, both vocal, and content wise?  Are your
performances 50/50--with the text counting as much as the performance,
or are they--say--30/70, in which performance and improv. counts more
than textual accuracy?

Please do check out Foley's book--it's great.

Jess
