"When we're all eating the litter of
our former selves we'll be nicer to everyone along the way who needs a
hand."

I can't help but think that's a bit naive, or else I'm missing the
irony. There are poor assholes and rich assholes; there are people who
have lost everything who have become more violent and those who have
become less violent.

dear family and friends, i have finally (21 years!) finished the novel i
started writing when annie was born (paula gunn allen suggested i write
and publish it--i wish she were here to see it up on-line), and the same
publisher who has my dissertation at his site has put _Dora_ up there too.
go to http://www.theguildofwriters.com/books/shop.php?action=full&id=378
to order it (i think you need paypal).  you will make my day for months to
come if you'll buy a copy ($11.18).  it comes as a pdf downloaded to your
computer.  i've checked it out, and it works.  i'm really happy to see it
up there--though, of course, as soon as i downloaded it, i wanted to edit
it again immediately.  it makes a big difference to imagine it being seen
by other people--a different view.

the publisher's intro is a bit strange, but read _Dora_ and tell me what
you think.

many blessings, gabrielle

I'm against the bailout too, but I am against it because I don't think it's the government's business to be involved in business. Let the free market take care of itself. On the other hand, I don't hate the rich business owners like so many of you on the Left, as I realize that these are the people who provide us with all the things we enjoy, and also provide all the job -- well, all the jobs that are not provided for through robbery, as government jobs are. I don't understand the glee in those who are wealthy because they engaged in peaceful trade with others, while the same people expressing such glee excuse the butchers running Leftist governments around the world. I am, on the other hand, not entirely bothered by these government-controlled and -regulated companies the Democrats have used as their own personal monetary playgrounds going under, as it demonstrates the wickedness of the Left and of government involvement in the economy. The lesson that
 should be learned here is that the government has failed us all -- again. I doubt, though, that that lesson is the one that will be learned, as too many want to believe the outright lies of the Left.

Subject: EXCITED for the math

When the Dow (the Tao of the wicked) plummeted 777 points yesterday I felt
awe and relief.  In our age we don't need to arrive at the castle gates with
pitchforks and torches, the rich will undo themselves.

"Average folks" will also suffer everyone's saying.  Aren't we already?  The
makeshift village of NICKELVILLE was attacked the other night by POLICE!
The homeless cannot even be allowed homelessness.

When I was a kid my mother and I lived in our car for a little more than
half a year.  It's a terrible thing to have to live like that.  But the
problem with our culture the way it is is that unless A LOT of people are
living like that, few will do anything to help.  We have SO MUCH in this
country SO MANY resources, there's no reason we can't change the way we're
living and be better people for one another.

Let the numbers dive into the abyss!  When we're all eating the litter of
our former selves we'll be nicer to everyone along the way who needs a
hand.  When I think back on the people who were brutal to us when we were
living in that car, I also think about the handful of folks who were
generous.  Every single person who was generous was poor themselves, barely
enough for their own tables.

Let the numbers escape them!  Let this be the most amazing time of our
lives!  I'm NOT ONE TO PRAY, but I'm praying that on Thursday there's still
no deal, and that the numbers crash and burn them out of their mansions and
country clubs.

GRACIAS A LA VIDA!

We went to visit Jonathan about five years ago, which is when she took these
photos.  If you look at the photograph of the house, there's a tree on the
right side of the photo in front of the house.  That tree is a Franklinia,
brought back by Jonathan as a sapling in the 1950s when he first visited
Philadelphia and sat beneath Bartram's Franklina tree named after Bartram's
good friend Benjamin Franklin.  Jonathan's amazing poems for Bartram wound
up in the New Directions book AN EAR IN BARTRAM'S TREE, terrific poems!

*Date: *September 30, 2008 11:45:00 AM PDT
*Subject: **Hayden Carruth*

It is with great sadness that I am writing to tell you that we have lost
another of our great poets. Hayden Carruth passed away last night, at
home,
in the company of his family.

His poems, books, and encouragements were foundational to Copper
Canyon and
much of our present day work would not be happening were it not for
him. He
was dearly loved here at the Press and will be greatly missed.

Subject:      Keala's film, "Noho Hewa"--go see it and vote for it,
              and (or if you're not in hawai'i) please donate! (fwd)
MIME-version: 1.0

dear Hawai'i and non-Hawai'i friends all, my friend Keala Kelly's film,
"Noho Hewa: The Wrongful Occupation of Hawai'i," has been accepted into
the Honolulu Film Festival.  The premiere will be at DOLE CANNERY on
OCTOBER 13, at 6 PM.  This is the ONLY film in the festival by a Hawaiian
(or anyone else) that deals with the extreme effects of militarization,
tourism, and GMO on Native Hawaiians and the land in Hawai'i.  It's very
important that as many people as possible go see this film and vote for it
at the premiere.  That's one of the few ways a film can make it out into
the world.  The importance of this is not about personalities or
individuals, but about getting the real information about Hawai'i out into
the world.  PLEASE GO SEE IT and, very importantly, VOTE FOR IT!

You can see a trailer at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P-gkEp1A4k.

If you are not in Hawai'i (and also if you are), Keala's website is
www.nohohewa.com.  Please also go there and donate--she needs to convert
the film to digi-beta, which costs about $300, and to survive for the next
month.  She is focusing completely on the film and cannot work till it's
done.

Keala recently coordinated and helped the Al Jazeera film crew to produce
their tv documentary on Hawai'i:
(Part 1
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIq8x9vnLf4
Part 2
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QqOJGSKGWQ&NR=1).

"Noho Hewa" is a film that those of you who are teachers will be using for
years to come to inform students about the situation on the ground in
Hawai'i.  Those of you who are not teachers will want to see "Noho Hewa"
to inform yourselves and your friends and families, so the lies about a
U.S. "Paradise" in Hawai'i can be stopped.

Voting for "Noho Hewa" means shining a public light in militarism,
desecration, the Akaka Bill and removal of Hawaiians from their homeland.
Your vote will really matter.  If this film comes away from this festival
without a prize, the issues in the film will remain ignored.  Let's not
let that happen.

blessings to all, gabe

 NOTE:
THE ARTICLE NEGLECTS TO MENTION TWO OTHER NOBEL WINNERS FROM THE USA:
SINCLAIR LEWIS AND WILLIAM FAULKNER

The Nobel boss left out a huge chunk of the globe, limiting himself to a
comparison between European and US American. writers.

Even in the relatively limited amount of work available in translation, in
the world today are a great many writers of staggering interest,and in term=
s
formal and of ideas and content, more wide ranging and challenging than
their US Americans counterparts.

I have always wondered if one could ask that instead of accepting the prize
money, one might instead be awarded with the equivalent in dynamite, the
invention of which made the Nobel prize possible in the first place.

After all, what self respecting literary detonator wants to cede the fields
of battle to "explosive best sellers" only!

"Literary bombshells!"--Why not the "Explosive Text" that comes complete
with detonator and dynamite, making it possible for the reader to complete
their perusal of the tome by setting a match to it and throwing it at the
target of their choice.  And in actuality giving the wishy-washy  term
"allowing the reader to create their own meanings" some "real force of
emphasis."  Who knows, the authors themselves might find that they are the
target of some of these engines of destruction they have set forth in this
unpredictable world of roaming "readers at large," or among the halls of
academies where their works have been assigned as "text-objects"
exemplifying the "aggressive qualities of the avant-garde"  that, when
joined with "an aggressive but previously nebulous sense of outrgae and
injustice," are "with dynamic energies"  bringing about "an entirely new
Form and Genre, that of the Sponteneously Combustible Word." As one august
personage put it most sagely--"Therefore returning to the Word its Powers o=
f
Revleation via the combination of the Aesthetic and the Chemcial Sublime."

One ecstatic winner of the Nobel tonnage of dyamite even went so far as to
stand tall against incoming American drones, greeting them with shoulder
propelled launchings of his "explosive texts" and chanting a slogan in a

 Nobel literature head: US too insular to compete

By MALIN RISING and HILLEL ITALIE =96 15 hours ago

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) =97 Bad news for American writers hoping for a Nobel
Prize next week: the top member of the award jury believes the United State=
s
is too insular and ignorant to compete with Europe when it comes to great
writing.

Counters the head of the U.S. National Book Foundation: "Put him in touch
with me, and I'll send him a reading list."

As the Swedish Academy enters final deliberations for this year's award,
permanent secretary Horace Engdahl said it's no coincidence that most
winners are European.

"Of course there is powerful literature in all big cultures, but you can't
get away from the fact that Europe still is the center of the literary worl=
d
... not the United States," he told The Associated Press in an exclusive
interview Tuesday.

He said the 16-member award jury has not selected this year's winner, and
dropped no hints about who was on the short list. Americans Philip Roth and
Joyce Carol Oates usually figure in speculation, but Engdahl wouldn't
comment on any names.

Speaking generally about American literature, however, he said U.S. writers
are "too sensitive to trends in their own mass culture," dragging down the
quality of their work.

"The U.S. is too isolated, too insular. They don't translate enough and
don't really participate in the big dialogue of literature," Engdahl said.
"That ignorance is restraining."

His comments were met with fierce reactions from literary officials across
the Atlantic.

"You would think that the permanent secretary of an academy that pretends t=
o
wisdom but has historically overlooked Proust, Joyce, and Nabokov, to name
just a few non-Nobelists, would spare us the categorical lectures," said
David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker.

"And if he looked harder at the American scene that he dwells on, he would
see the vitality in the generation of Roth, Updike, and DeLillo, as well as
in many younger writers, some of them sons and daughters of immigrants
writing in their adopted English. None of these poor souls, old or young,
seem ravaged by the horrors of Coca-Cola."

Harold Augenbraum, executive director of the foundation which administers
the National Book Awards, said he wanted to send Engdahl a reading list of
U.S. literature.

"Such a comment makes me think that Mr. Engdahl has read little of American
literature outside the mainstream and has a very narrow view of what
constitutes literature in this age," he said.

"In the first place, one way the United States has embraced the concept of
world culture is through immigration. Each generation, beginning in the lat=
e
19th century, has recreated the idea of American literature."

He added that this is something the English and French are discovering as
immigrant groups begin to take their place in those traditions.

The most recent American to win the award was Toni Morrison in 1993. Other
American winners include Saul Bellow, John Steinbeck and Ernest Hemingway.

As permanent secretary, Engdahl is a voting member of and spokesman for the
secretive panel that selects the winners of what many consider the most
prestigious award in literature.

The academy often picks obscure writers and hardly ever selects best-sellin=
g
authors. It regularly faces accusations of snobbery, political bias and eve=
n
poor taste.

Since Japanese writer Kenzaburo Oe won the award in 1994, the selections
have had a distinct European flavor. Nine of the subsequent laureates were
Europeans, including last year's winner, Doris Lessing of Britain. Of the
other four, one was from Turkey and the others from South Africa, China and
Trinidad. All had strong ties to Europe.

Engdahl said Europe draws literary exiles because it "respects the
independence of literature" and can serve as a safe haven.

"Very many authors who have their roots in other countries work in Europe,
because it is only here where you can be left alone and write, without bein=
g
beaten to death," he said. "It is dangerous to be an author in big parts of
Asia and Africa."

Kwame Anthony Appiah, a leading African scholar and a professor of
philosophy at Princeton University, said that there has been a long history
of American writers being influenced by authors elsewhere and in turn havin=
g
an impact overseas, including in Europe.

"Is America really a diminished presence in the literary world? That's not
the sense you get looking at European book stores. I'm always amazed how
many of the books in German or Italian bookstores are translations from
American English," Appiah said.

"The big dialogue of literature isn't just going on in Paris and Frankfurt
... I assume even Engdahl agrees it is not centered on Stockholm," he said.

The Nobel Prize announcements start next week with the medicine award on
Monday, followed by physics, chemistry, peace and economics. Next Thursday
is a possible date for the literature prize, but the Swedish Academy by
tradition only gives the date two days before.

Engdahl suggested the announcement date could be a few weeks away, saying
"it could take some time" before the academy settles on a name.

Each Nobel Prize includes a $1.3 million purse, a gold medal and a diploma.
The awards are handed out Dec. 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred
Nobel's death in 1896.

Eating Chocolate Ice Cream: Reading Mayakovsky


Since I've decided to revolutionize my life
                         since
                                     "
                         decided

                         revolutionize
                                                 "
                         life
                                                 "

How early it is! It is eight o'clock in the morning.
Well, the pigeons were up earlier
Did you eat all your eggs?
Now we shall go for a long walk.
Now? There is too much winter.
I am going to admire the snow on your coat.
Time for hot soup, already?
You have worked for three solid hours.
I have written forty-eight, no forty-nine,
no fifty-one poems.
How many states are there?
I cannot remember what is uniting America.
It is then time for your nap.
What a lovely, pleasant dream I just had.
But I like waking up better.
I do admire reality like snow on my coat.
Would you take cream or lemon in your tea?
No sugar?
And no cigarettes.
Daytime is good, but evening is better.
I do like our evening discussions.
Yesterday we talked about Kant.
Today let's think about Hegel.
In another week we shall have reached Marx.
Goody.
Life is a joy if one has industrious hands.
Supper? Stew and well-cooked. Delicious.
Well, perhaps just one more glass of milk.
Nine o'clock! Bath time!
Soap and a clean rough towel.
Bedtime!
The Red Army is marching tonight.
They shall march through my dreams
in their new shiny leather boots,
their freshly laundered shirts.
All those ugly stains of caviar and champagne
and kisses
have been rubbed away.
They are going to the barracks.
They are answering hundreds of pink
and yellow and blue and white telephones.
How happy and contented and well-fed they look
lounging on their fur divans,
chanting "Russia how kind you are to us.
How kind you are to everybody.
We want to live forever."
Before I wake up they will throw away
their pistols, and magically
factories will spring up where once
there was rifle fire, a roulette factory,
where once a body fell from an open window.
Hurry dear dream
I am waiting for you
under the eiderdown.
And tomorrow will be more real, perhaps,
than yesterday.

David,
While the Nobel committee's remarks seem a bit provocative, I tend to agree
with them.  Maybe they were asked to consider American authors for the
award, prompted by those who may think America is beginning to feel left
out, since there hasn't been a literature laureate here for over 15 years.
Their perception might be accurate, as I too think there is a dearth of
translation, that we aren't widely encouraged to read translations, and that
those which do get published are poorly distributed or rarely discussed.  I
won't even try to account for the plummeting of reading practices among U.S.
citizens under 30, but it seems to be at an epidemic stage right now.  There
is also a damaging lack of large-scale commitments to serious translation
projects, projects that should be a priority in our literary culture.  This
also comes with a widespread absence of second-language instruction in our
grammar schools.  On top of all this, the literary-critical community has
been shying away from ideas of a "national" literature for some decades.
This must play a role in the perception of "insularity" in American
literature, even if it seems counterintuitive:  it might just be the
defining characteristic of American literature today that there is an almost
unanimous agreement among authors and critics that it lacks any defining
characteristics.  Maybe we are insular in that we don't have enough critical
distance to even help develop a useful picture of ourselves.  And why does
Roberto Bolano's _Savage Detectives_ seem like the best American novel of
the past 20 years to me?

As for the "explosive" best sellers: I am reminded of a remark made by
Christopher Morley of the Algonquin Roundtable, belle-lettrist of the
"Knothole" hermitage in Nassau County:

"Printer's ink has been running a race against gunpowder these many, many
years.  Ink is handicapped, in a way, because you can blow up a man with
gunpowder in half a second, while it may take twenty years to blow him up
with a book.  But the gunpowder destroys itself along with its victim, while
a book can keep on exploding for centuries."

peace,
Doug

this online community. We appreciate all submissions, but will be more
selective in what we choose to post. Queries for contact info,
messages intended for just a few subscribers, messages that are not on
topic, "flame" messages, and free-standing personal poems or journal
entries will, in general, not be forwarded to the list.

1. Posting to the List

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible. While we recognize that other
lists may sponsor other possibilities for exchange, we request that
those participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focused nature of this project and respect our decision to operate a
moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support and encourage
divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to doing what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Posts are limited to list
subscribers. All messages are reviewed by the editors in keeping with
the goals of the list as articulated in this Welcome Message. The
listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for discussion
and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow listserv
policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

Please note that this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics. We strongly encourage subscribers to post
information, including web links, relating to publications (print and
internet), reading series, and blogs that they have coordinated,
edited or published, or in which they appear. Such announcements
constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Queres for contact info, messages intended
for just a few subscribers, "flame" messages, and free-standing
personal poems or journal entries will, in general, not be forwarded
to the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers. Personal queries and off-topic submissions will not be
posted.

Send messages directly to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


2. About the Poetics List

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1500 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation.

In addition to being archived through the EPC and at the UB Listerv
archive, some posts to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices,
announcements, etc.) may also become part of specific EPC subject
areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also online at the
EPC.

3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email us at poetics.list --at -- gmail.com, subject-line
"registration," with your full name, street address, email address,
and telephone number. Failure to register at the time of subscription
will result in automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed frorm the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

In moderating this list, the editors must consider sometimes competing
interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

All posts not only go out to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

Note: Private correspondence via email and letters are always (c) the
author and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without the
written permission of the author. As a general rule, we will not
publish posts that include such material unless they indicate that
permission has been given.

We request that posters limit the number of posts they send to the
list on any given day. Given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 75
or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be changed at
the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

7. Flaming
"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This, of course, includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

the obvious contradiction here is plain for all to see: "I don't think it's
the government's business to be involved in business," and yet "The lesson
that should be learned here is that the government has failed us all --
again."

government has failed us PRECISELY because it failed to regulate business.

Subject:      love on -empyre-
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

October 2008, 'love' on -empyre-


'love'


"Oh my friends, there is no friend..."

Jacques Derrida, quoting Montaigne, quoting
Aristotle...in his treatise on friendship.

"There are no equals, only rivals..."

Constantine in the BBC docudrama, 'Ancient Rome: The
Rise and Fall of an Empire'...as he cultivated an
empire of Christian love.

"For nails would not have held God-and-Man fast to the
Cross, had love not held Him there..."

Saint Catherine of Siena


One supposes in life that some things are possible.
Love is one of these things, no? We presume such a
thing is possible? But what if love were impossible?

Our relationship with love, god (and the infinity of
price and spectacle), is recently articulated in
Damien Hirst’s 'For the Love of God' (2007), Platinum
skull, 8,601 diamonds and human teeth,(17.1 x 12.7 x
19.1 cm).

$100 million. A record: the highest price ever paid
for the work of a living artist. One marvels that we
can any longer, truly render Aquinas’ corporeal
metaphors for spiritual things. As for love: some
euphoria of the genetic Code and capitalizations as
currencies of that Code? A molecular symphony of
melancholy and bliss? As for God: Neurotransmissions?
A battery of concepts, like 8,601 diamonds in the
rough? All of which pale in comparison, perhaps, to
what is wished for in the impossibility of love as the
gift of some Other?

So two things: god and love. Every major religion of
the world syncopates these two concepts,
paradoxically, via the utilization of conceptual
infinity, and one concept’s weakness becomes the other
concept’s strength: the horizon of god’s love is
endless, and the horizon of one’s love for god, should
be too.

Yes, that is it: love is the purview of sacrifice. We
must bleed for love. This is the claim of the
disciple; the saint, and poet. But there are no saints
any longer, and poetry is endangered, if not extinct.
And the sacred, by definition, is always exterminated
as a functional violence of the holy service.

Is there no love, and instead, only relations of
sacrifice?

Join us in this thematic discussion and we shall
see...

The Nobel is the Oscar
for lit. And since no
Oscar was given to There
Will Be Blood, imagine the Nobel.

Dear Douglas and Stephen and all--

I think you can see from my letter that I agree with the Capo di Capi at the
Nobel; I simply extended his range from Europe to the rest of the world.

Something which has interested me for some time and I have written about, is
why it is that Savage Detectives is the one Bolano book that is always
mentioned by Americans, when several other, and better, of his works are
avaialble in translation from New Directions. I have a feeling that works
such as By Night in Chile, usually conisdered his masterpiece, especially in
terms of the writing, Distant Star and Nazi Literature of the Americas have
received less attetion, as have Amulet, also about Meixco, the events of
1968 and many of the young poets who show up in Savage Detectives, and Last
Evenings on Earth, a collection of excellent short stories. The first three
named, especailly, are profound explorastions of the connections between
modern poetry--and in Distant Star's case, multi-media poetry--and Fascism,
torture and violence.  Since the By Night in Chile and Distant Star (itself
a novella developed from the last entry in the Nazi Literature book, the
best seeling of Bolano's works in Latin America) are centered around the
events of 9/11/73 in Chile, and include written and unwritten allusion to
the American inolvement in these events and their aftermath, perhaps readers
in the USA prefer to ignore them for the youth-notalgia of Savage
Detectives, which excludes the sinister aspects of the times.

The house which figures in the final scenes of By Night in Chile is being
considered to be made a museum today in Chile, for in it a novelist and her
American husband held the most glittering literary salon of the Pinochet
Era, attended by many of the cream of literary-critical establishment who
felt themselves above the coup.  It turned out that the American husband was
an American agent in chrage of tortures in the basement underneath the
literary salon, and the Chilean wife later found herself and their children
abandoned by him, when he sought refuge somehwere in the USA.  The long arm
of this nightmare period extends to several of the exiled Chilean and Latin
American writers and friends in the stories of Last Evenings on Earth.

The current events in Central and Latin America are part of a huge movement
to push out for good the influence and oppression of the US, to rid the
region of the economic policies which are now catching up to the Anmericans
themselves, and to say good riddance for ever to the Monroe Doctrine, a
Doctrine which even Obama re-embraced during the campaign earlier this
year.  There is also the question of the Inidegenous, which threatens the US
in the form of the president of Bolivia, Morales, who is an Indian and the
first Indigenous person elected the head of a country anywhere in the
world.  The USA refused to sin the International Recognition of Rights of
Indigenous Peoples, which means that its own Indians remain as a population
without the same rights as the rest of the people.

I wonder if another roadblock to translation is the discouragement towards
other languages which is so marked in the US--that "why should we learn
their languages when everybody learns English anyaway," and the continual
attempts to make English the official language.    Immigrants who arrived
were supposed to assimilate into the new language, and their children to
neglect the language of their parents.  Eventually this became a form of
traveling away from foreign languages as much as possible in all areas of
the society, though the immigrants continue to arrive.  Perhaps "foreign
languages" are connected in a subconsious way with the "non-American"
pre-American exitsence of the ancestors, which needs to be "buried" as it
were.  After all, one finds a great many Americans who rant about the "evil
Europens" who arrived and sluaghtered the Indians and destroyed the
envirnoment--and yet those same "evil Europeans" were the forebearers of the
Americans of today.  It is as though the forebearers and their languages are
insome way not at all related to the Americans of the present, who rage
about the evils of the Western Civilization in the Western hemisphere, via
the tenets of Western philosphy and ethics.  A disconnect with the past is
created in which the enlgithened present carries onas though perhaps
purified of the past, and so does not connect it in anyway with the actions
of the present. If one is afarid of foreigness and the past, is one not then
locked into an insularity in space and time, in which what is demanded is an
endless imperial expansion as a continual sign of "triumph" and "rightness"?

It may seem paradoxical to be insualr and at the ame time on Imperilaist
rampages--yet all one has to do is mobilize the insularity, so that its
encounters with the foreign aboard are in terms of "new land and peoples to
conquer."  That is, to destory for the most part, so they are not in fact
actual people but "foriegners," "aliens and "their value of life is inferiro
to ours."  The same rhetoric runs throughout American history, from the
non-human Indian to the "let Asian boys fight Asians Wars" becuase "they
don't value life as highly as we do" of Vietnam to the same thing todayy
regrading Palestinains, Irqis, Iranins, Pakistanis, Afghans, Pashtun,
whoever the guns are trained on next.  "Illegal aliens" with in the US" are
treated in the same manner, as are an ever growing number of Americans
overcrowding the American prison system.

The intesne insanity greeting the "Bailout" is the same that greeted
"foreign attacks" on 9/11 and led to the "immediate danger and urgency" of
the "swiftly victoris wars" in Afghanistan and Iraq, where the Americans
were to be greeted with floers and crowds asking for bubble gum with cards
of the conquering heroes.  "We are being attacked!" the Senators and
Congresspersons and Paulson are all screaming--the Bailout has to right
now!!  It's as though some "alien entity" has invaded the otherwise noble
and righteous American sytem and immediate and extreme actions have to be
taken, following which Paulson will pretty much be respsonable to no one but
himself.  A coup will have taklen place that was voted on with al the
reasoning involved in going completely hysterically hallucinatorilly mad.

The "fear of the foreign" oddly begn with the first sights of the new World
and its indigenous peoples--

(Actually Stepeh, Mishima never won the Nobel Prize; the year that he
thought that he might, his fellow countryman Kawabata Yasunari won, a great
writer considered in Japan more Jpanese than Mishima, who despite his
Nationalism and wanting to return to the militarism of the Japanese past,
was regarded as being much more Western influenced than Kawabata.  In
Mishima's Sun and Steel, the original birth of his ideas of the beautiful
body occurred during a trip to Greece, and were truly awakened by the sight
of the young men in a fesitavl on his return to japan.  The Literal
"trajectory" of his thinking on ":sun and steel" finds its ultimate
expression in a short piece following the text, in which he recounts his
ascent in a fighter plane.  This extraordinary combination of mysticism,
militarism and the body-militant turnsinto the kind of aestheticized poetry
of pure speed as pure being of a Futurist Fascism which Marinetti never even
dreamed of.

In Mishima's novel Forbidden Colors, the protagaonist is a man so beautiful
that when making love with is beautiful wife, he sees himself watching
himself making love to himself, rather than with her. Mishima's writing and
works in film trace the arc of this intenisification of desire for physical
and youthful male beauty with that of the warrior at the moment of death, in
the serrvice of an ideal higher than his own flesh--that of the Emperor,
symbol of a Deity of a Nationalsim which is really Mishima's cult of the
hero Mishima, saving the Nation , failing and dying the great and most
honorbale of deaths.  It is an incredoible and long prpepared for moment of
theater as action which he had "rehearsed for" in the film almost a decde
earlier in which he commits with his wife a ritual sepuuku.  The apotheosis
of male auto- eroticism, the fascistic aesthetisization of the body militant
which becomes at one with a jet fighter, at one with the Emperor, at one
with the Japan of the samuruai and at one with death--Mishima carried al
this out literally "to the hilt."  And also wrote of it in a way that goes
beyond even the most elbaorate of the e texts in Klaus Theweleit's
monumental masterpiece, the two volume Male Fantasies.

On the morning of his final day, Mishima wrote the last pages of his great
tetraology, titlted ironically after that place on the Moon called "The Sea
of Fertility."  The name of the book is "The Decay of the Angel" and it as
some of Mishima's most beaitufl writing in it, and its ending is "perfectly
staged" as it were for the words and scene that are to be the author's last.

Hi everyone,

I've been fairly quiet the past few months on POETICS, but have decided that
the completion of my first MS would be a good way to break the silence.

If anyone would be willing to read *What Happens to Light* (46 poems,
approx. 65 pages), please shoot me an e-mail and I'll forward you the MS in
whatever format is easiest for you (although it currently exists as a Word
document). Any feedback, criticism, questions, answers, vitriol, praise,
etc. etc. would be far more than welcome, especially if you would be so kind
as to do so by the end of the month.

If you want a smaller sample before committing to the whole shebang, some of
my most recent poems can be found in Vol. 2.3 of Prick of the Spindle (
http://www.prickofthespindle.com/).


Thanks in advance,

Eric

  Instead of the Nobel Prize for lit, why not the Vulgar prize,
  awarded to those poets/playwrights/and authors who excell in
  intellectually compelling, offensive texts. How many Nobel winners
  would fit both catagories? Pirandello's "Six characters in Search
  of An Author" caused riots when it was first produced. He would
  certainly qualify. Would any American?

  It's possible to be both insular and innovative. Faulkner: the man
  was obsessed with the tragic history of the South; he hated
  anything to do with travel. He simply wrote/wrote/wrote some of
  the most breathtaking, risky prose of the 20th century. Hemingway,
  of course, was the exact opposite, a globetrotting word painter.
  & of course, Eliot is awarded the prize, but WCW is ignored. &
  Williams is the father, or Whitman son, of all American poetry,
  especially the innovative.

Apparently you are unfamiliar with the two ways of using the word "business," which I use for effect. Also, the government failed us because of the regulations it has on the books and because it "encouraged" (and we all know what it means when government "encourages" you to do something) Fannie Mae to encourage subprime loans. Consider this article from 1999 where a free market economist predicted that this would happen:

http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE7DB153EF933A0575AC0A96F958260&sec=&spon=&&scp=2&sq=holmes%20fannie%20mae&st=cse

The only contradiction lies in anyone believing the government has any business being in business -- or that the government is here to help you and not to rob you of what you have. People go into government because they want to rule others. Anyone who believes otherwise is naive.

the obvious contradiction here is plain for all to see: "I don't think it's
the government's business to be involved in business," and yet "The lesson
that should be learned here is that the government has failed us all --
again."

government has failed us PRECISELY because it failed to regulate business.

Dear friends:

Ed Baker's Restoration Poems is now available from the CVP website:
http://web.mac.com/countryvalley

"Here is the dwelling of past in present. The craft of abiding and an
abiding craft. Here is our home to be."
--John Martone

"To feel an old house being restored actually and within the fresh
materials of these poems 'chinked/w a secret/mix',
brings us all at once to one fine poet's home: now sit down and read
its timbres, words and boards, close to the fire."
--David Giannini


All the best,

From the Harriet Blog this a.m.



Featuring the work of 3, 164 poets. Completely unpermissioned and
unauthorized, pissing off the entire poetry community. Either you're in or
you're not. Full roster below the fold.

From http://www.forgodot.com/2008/10/issue-1-release-announcement.html:





For what's it worth, kudos to these three young guys.=A0 I imagine
they're students, twiddling their thumbs, trying to imagine how to stir
up the poetry world, steeped in some sort of theory (situationist?
dada-ist? surrealism?=A0 etc), facing the menacing world of "getting
published" and making something of themselves as poets, ahem.=A0 They've
decided to take on the death of the lyrical I, the death of the author,
the death of paper, the celebration of the internet sea, etc.=A0 They've
done something, though just what isn't clear, but yes, kudos to their
efforts to make a mess of the pool of internet muck -- it may be only a
ripple in the end, but maybe some of the worthwhile work and sites and
ideas will get a chance to rise (not necessarily from the anthology) after =
their
pebble has sunk to disappearance.

No irony here.  I have a firm disbelief that ANYTHING will be done to help
the poor unless there are millions more made poor.  My grandmother used to
mention that during the Great Depression everyone who was poor was helping
one another, and were used to lending help, sharing food, sharing
responsibilities with the kids, the washing.  The rich were throwing
themselves out windows at the same time because, like my grandmother said
and I believe her to be right, the rich knew that without their money their
friends were no longer their friends.  The poor have always only had one
another.  This is not naive, this is survival.

From my experience I can say that being desperately poor is awful.  But I
can also say that (something I've already said) it's other poor people who
give the most.

Call me naive, that's fine, I've been called much worse.  But the rich will
never lend a hand to the poor unless that hand is MADE to thrust forward.
History has shown this, and history shows it winds up being kind to no one
in the end, this sort of politics.

Call me naive Elizabeth, but poverty itself is created by the most violent
people on earth, those with the most money to perpetuate war and genocide.
And poverty is a form of war, a form of genocide.

Do you realize there have not been this many poor people (entire
families!) homeless, living in tents in America since the Great Depression?
The BBC has a bus on tour of America right now, leading up to the election,
and they have shown parking lots of people living in cars.  They've shown
the red tents of NICKELVILLE, which the police raided and terrorized most
recently.  Amy Goodman of DEMOCRACY NOW recently interviewed activists
trying to help the terrified families of NICKELVILLE who were raided.  And
NICKELVILLE is being shown so often because of its catchy name more than
anything, but there are a lot of places like NICKELVILLE in this country
right now.

None of this matters at the moment though as the vote went through.  The
world will breathe a sigh, and go on making shit no one needs to sell to
people who need nothing more than they already have while millions and
millions will fight and scrap over their place in line at the Salvation Army
food table.  My mother and I spent some nights at the Salvation Army when I
was a kid and it was awful.  They make you sing hymns and listen to
ridiculous lectures (sermons) about Jesus before you eat.  We did it because
we were hungry, of course, but when I look back on it I feel it's a terrible
thing to keep hungry people hungry until they adhere to your religious
doctrine.  And I especially remember one Salvation Army in Chicago where we
shared space with a Jewish mother and her two little girls, but they sang,
we all sang, you had to fucking sing.  This isn't naive, this is survival.

They got their vote the way they wanted it.  The money is for the rich,
again.  They pilfer and rape our resources and make presidential candidates
take their eyes off the war yet again.  And I still say that unless EVERYONE
is brought to their knees nothing will be done.  The poor need enormous
numbers before a FDR steps up and does something.  And I'm voting for Obama,
but when I hear him talk about Welfare Reform (welfare for the poor that is)
there seems little help on the way.  700 billion in welfare for the rich
seems fine to Washington though.

a lot of pretty average people have 401Ks and IRAs that're in mutual funds

it is mostly funds that dabble in mortgage-backed securities as well as in
shares in banks

a lot of pretty average people own houses or enough land for a doublewide; a
lot of people live in cars already (or, in our neighborhood, non-operable
campers parked on the street), and a lot of pretty ordinary people are
annoyed by people living in cars without feeling that they should assist
them, allow them to tap their electricity, or use their water

in the debates last night it seems that a certain person on a presidential
ticket as veep blamed banks for pushing exotic mortgages; an interesting
question is should exotic mortgages be available?  should certain financial
instruments be available to only people who have the education to understand
the risk of junk bonds, derivatives? what risk is? and of course those
people should not be bailed out?  but the government created that market by
keeping the prime rate artificially low.  the same government that has now
showed us twice that trickle-down doesn't work -- you know, that
trickle-down theory the same veep wannabe supported last night.

fannie mae was a great New Deal program that allowed more financial
institutions to make more loans to lower middle class and working class
would-be homeowners (banks previously were mostly loaning to the wealthy or
to companies -- so, for example, that whole bit in the jungle about buying a
house on time from the builder -- individuals couldn't get loans); freddie
mac was a little more dubious, a sort of "seems like a Great Society
program, but created under Nixon"; the loans weren't for amounts that would
purchase a median-priced home in most markets

I'm not really sure what this has to do with poetry; it seems complex
enough, but a nice combo of tangible and  intangible, politics and personal
experience

I really like the "equal housing lender" logo

Hi, Stephen.

I came across the odd surprise today of finding a poem by me (?) in =
arsonism's issue #1:

Witchcraft

Misses and has

                        Daniel Zimmerman

(p. 3593).

Nice. I wish I had written it (or perhaps I did--via witchcraft!). I =
don't know the Daniel Zimmerman=20
who did write this poem (though I'd like to), but if you plan an issue =
#2, you might want to choose
from

http://www.fieralingue.it/modules.php?name=3DContent&pa=3Dlist_pages_cate=
gories&cid=3D44

or

http://beardofbees.com/zimmerman.html

or

http://www.origamicondom.org/IssuesPDFs/OC.03.pdf (pp. 30-31)

--poems by (the real, as far as I know) Daniel Zimmeman.

(Too bad you didn't include biographies.)

I guess you've pissed a lot of poets off by publishing their stuff =
without permission.
Well, you didn't publish mine without permission (since I didn't write =
that one),=20
but you have permission to pick one from the sites above.

Your magazine (!) raises interesting questions about copyright. Since it =
appears you've
used only one piece by each writer, one might regard it as "inspired =
use" or a kind of
ad campaign for poets that might interest browsers in finding out more =
about particular
writers. I wouldn't mind, but I know some of the poets you've published, =
and they know
me; I wouldn't want them to think that I wrote that poem (though I do =
like it) if I didn't,
nor would I want the other Daniel Zimmerman to hear of me getting credit =
for it and
thus thinking that I had plagiarized his work. (If everyone had the same =
name, this would
not present a problem.) Anyhow, good luck with your project.

Best,

Daniel Zimmerman (this one)

I suppose this is the proper response:

I'm now curious to find who's NOT on the list....

the book is mesmerizing till you realize the poems aren't by the poets! (I
THOUGHT Rukeyser, Wms & Leonard Cohen sounded awfully contemporary!) then
you see what they have in common--similes. of course it's thrilling to be
included with rimbaud & yoko.

The editors of this anthology excluded (the names of) several of my favorite
poets, and I must say -- rather sincerely! -- that I am offended on their
behalf.

A poem on this sort of attitude toward the rich (who are quite generous, not to mention being the ones who provide jobs for everyone -- look to rick liberal politicians for lack of personal generosity):

No irony here.  I have a firm disbelief that ANYTHING will be done to help
the poor unless there are millions more made poor.  My grandmother used to
mention that during the Great Depression everyone who was poor was helping
one another, and were used to lending help, sharing food, sharing
responsibilities with the kids, the washing.  The rich were throwing
themselves out windows at the same time because, like my grandmother said
and I believe her to be right, the rich knew that without their money their
friends were no longer their friends.  The poor have always only had one
another.  This is not naive, this is survival.

From my experience I can say that being desperately poor is awful.  But I
can also say that (something I've already said) it's other poor people who
give the most.

Call me naive, that's fine, I've been called much worse.  But the rich will
never lend a hand to the poor unless that hand is MADE to thrust forward.
History has shown this, and history shows it winds up being kind to no one
in the end, this sort of politics.

Call me naive Elizabeth, but poverty itself is created by the most violent
people on earth, those with the most money to perpetuate war and genocide.
And poverty is a form of war, a form of genocide.

Do you realize there have not been this many poor people (entire
families!) homeless, living in tents in America since the Great Depression?
The BBC has a bus on tour of America right now, leading up to the election,
and they have shown parking lots of people living in cars.  They've shown
the red tents of NICKELVILLE, which the police raided and terrorized most
recently.  Amy Goodman of DEMOCRACY NOW recently interviewed activists
trying to help the terrified families of NICKELVILLE who were raided.  And
NICKELVILLE is being shown so often because of its catchy name more than
anything, but there are a lot of places like NICKELVILLE in this country
right now.

None of this matters at the moment though as the vote went through.  The
world will breathe a sigh, and go on making shit no one needs to sell to
people who need nothing more than they already have while millions and
millions will fight and scrap over their place in line at the Salvation Army
food table.  My mother and I spent some nights at the Salvation Army when I
was a kid and it was awful.  They make you sing hymns and listen to
ridiculous lectures (sermons) about Jesus before you eat.  We did it because
we were hungry, of course, but when I look back on it I feel it's a terrible
thing to keep hungry people hungry until they adhere to your religious
doctrine.  And I especially remember one Salvation Army in Chicago where we
shared space with a Jewish mother and her two little girls, but they sang,
we all sang, you had to fucking sing.  This isn't naive, this is survival.

They got their vote the way they wanted it.  The money is for the rich,
again.  They pilfer and rape our resources and make presidential candidates
take their eyes off the war yet again.  And I still say that unless EVERYONE
is brought to their knees nothing will be done.  The poor need enormous
numbers before a FDR steps up and does something.  And I'm voting for Obama,
but when I hear him talk about Welfare Reform (welfare for the poor that is)
there seems little help on the way.  700 billion in welfare for the rich
seems fine to Washington though.

I am very curious as to the precise algorithms or other methods used in the
gathering of these names and the creation of these poems.Twilight appears in
the title and body of "my" poem, which is a keyword for me and is in the
title of the online journal I run, but the line breaks are weak.

... and either less or more so if you recognise that the "poems" were
produced by a text generation engine, and (presumably arbitraily) assigned
to names trawled from the Web.

If anyone has a right to complain here, it's Text Generation Machine Mark
119, whose essential contribution to the anthology isn't acknowledged.

It's difficult to imagine who will be reading any of the 3000+ pages of
randomly-generated twaddle, other than the "authors" to whom any particular
stretch of words is arbitrarily assigned.

(Add to a child whom not even its mother could love, an anthology that not
even the compilers bothered to read.)

Did the "editors" even read the list of names compiled by their 'bot, or
simply feed them directly into the cover of the work?

        Enquiring minds want to know ...

Well, not really, but it would be *slightly interesting to know which text
generation machine was used, and what instructions were given to the 'bots
in their search for names.

Given the ommissions, I'd guess that the 'bots were scoring below random
chance in any search assocaited with the terms "poet" or "poetry".

Well CA, I've been brutalized by men who were quite poor, when I was quite
poor, so frankly saying that everyone will be wonderfully kind when they are
poor runs up against what I have learned about survival. If I took on the
belief that poverty made people help each other, I would likely be raped
again (real rape, not the metaphorical kind used to score a point in an
argument) and probably killed.

In my case, the violence was highly gendered, but that's not always so. My
father grew up in a New Jersey slum, and he had to be tough not because the
rich kids from a few neighborhoods away would hurt him otherwise but because
the kids in his own neighborhood would.

Please remember that you and your family are not the only ones with the
experience of not knowing where your next meal is coming from.

Having money certainly magnifies the ability of people do harm, and yes,
poverty can be a form of genocide. I never suggested otherwise.

Do I "realize there have not been this many poor people (entire families!)
homeless, living in tents in America since the Great Depression?" Yes, in
fact, I do. How does that invalidate my experience that tells me that the
poor do not always help the poor? Incidentally, they're pink tents, and it's
called NickelSville after the mayor of Seattle. Frankly, you seem to be
implying that my disagreement with your notions of how poor people behave
shows that I don't care about how poor people suffer. That's both dishonest,
and insulting.

I don't get this. Why should anyone spend so much time and effort 'p...ing
off the poetry community'?  What kind of utterly shallow aspiration is that?
If the intention had been to amuse the poetic community I might have given
it some credence but I object to its intention and I couldn't give a fig if
I'm mentioned or not - I'm certainly not ploughing through that list to find
out.  I'd lose my will to live and I don't need silly endorsements of this
kind.

I also find it strange that 'whoever' seems to think the 'poetic community'
is of one mind.  I think the posting to this list have shown that poets are
very diverse in their reactions.  My reaction?  I find it rather depressing
that in these troubled times (aren't times always troubled) there are far

Some of those poets aren't american at all - Gunnar Ekel=C3=B6f, Leevi Lehto,
Kari Kokko, and others. That makes you one of the top 3164 poets in the
world!

Dear Geraldine,

You're just jealous no one googled your name. Or maybe they did and I didn't see it because I only looked up my name, read the poem I wrote and then closed it.

What's the point in being made of fun as being shallow if I can't be shallow once in a while!

I don't get this. Why should anyone spend so much time and effort
'p...ing
off the poetry community'?  What kind of utterly shallow aspiration is
that?
If the intention had been to amuse the poetic community I might have given
it some credence but I object to its intention and I couldn't give a fig if
I'm mentioned or not - I'm certainly not ploughing through that list to
find
out.  I'd lose my will to live and I don't need silly endorsements of
this
kind.

I also find it strange that 'whoever' seems to think the 'poetic
community'
is of one mind.  I think the posting to this list have shown that poets are
very diverse in their reactions.  My reaction?  I find it rather depressing
that in these troubled times (aren't times always troubled) there are far
more deserving people to p.off.  I think 'whoever' did it should be
updated
on the world situation and then maybe they could consider getting a life.

That's the odd thing -- whatever method of selection was used, it doesn't
seem to have been a very useful or effective one, and it looks as if the
names weren't taken directly from google -- it's almost easier to note the
omitted names you'd expect from a straight trawl of high or even low profile
sites or whatever than to work out why anyone *is there.

Perhaps the problem is that not *enough work was put into it, beyond linking
a text generation program to a search mechanism, and pouring the results
straight into a preformatted pdf file.

A couple of evenings work for a relatively competent programmer, finally.

Irritation on the cheap.

Well -- thank you for your generally positive response (or at least not
aggressively negative, like some recent posts on the Poetry Foundation's
Harriet blog). For my part, I'm getting a good laugh out of this whole
thing. Just changed all my passwords to be on the safe side.


All the best --

I'm glad I'm not the only one who is pleased to be included in *any *anthology,

Anthology aside, what a search engine optimization technique this is for a
blog. For Godot and its editors have gone viral overnight.

The whole thing is wonderful fun, exactly what poetry needs once in a  while,
some playful ribbing. I'm even getting used to "my" poem (a  little).

In the midst of this so far rather minor flap (Until my SSN is circulated,
I'm keeping my cool.), I'd like to make a request. Anyone out there with a
published chapbook, a favorable disposition, and the means to cover
international shipping should send a copy or two my way. My address is
below.

No irony here.  I have a firm disbelief that ANYTHING will be done to help
the poor unless there are millions more made poor.  My grandmother used to
mention that during the Great Depression everyone who was poor was helping
one another, and were used to lending help, sharing food, sharing
responsibilities with the kids, the washing.  The rich were throwing
themselves out windows at the same time because, like my grandmother said
and I believe her to be right, the rich knew that without their money their
friends were no longer their friends.  The poor have always only had one
another.  This is not naive, this is survival.

From my experience I can say that being desperately poor is awful.  But I
can also say that (something I've already said) it's other poor people who
give the most.

Call me naive, that's fine, I've been called much worse.  But the rich will
never lend a hand to the poor unless that hand is MADE to thrust forward.
History has shown this, and history shows it winds up being kind to no one
in the end, this sort of politics.

Call me naive Elizabeth, but poverty itself is created by the most violent
people on earth, those with the most money to perpetuate war and genocide.
And poverty is a form of war, a form of genocide.

Do you realize there have not been this many poor people (entire
families!) homeless, living in tents in America since the Great Depression?
The BBC has a bus on tour of America right now, leading up to the election,
and they have shown parking lots of people living in cars.  They've shown
the red tents of NICKELVILLE, which the police raided and terrorized most
recently.  Amy Goodman of DEMOCRACY NOW recently interviewed activists
trying to help the terrified families of NICKELVILLE who were raided.  And
NICKELVILLE is being shown so often because of its catchy name more than
anything, but there are a lot of places like NICKELVILLE in this country
right now.

None of this matters at the moment though as the vote went through.  The
world will breathe a sigh, and go on making shit no one needs to sell to
people who need nothing more than they already have while millions and
millions will fight and scrap over their place in line at the Salvation Army
food table.  My mother and I spent some nights at the Salvation Army when I
was a kid and it was awful.  They make you sing hymns and listen to
ridiculous lectures (sermons) about Jesus before you eat.  We did it because
we were hungry, of course, but when I look back on it I feel it's a terrible
thing to keep hungry people hungry until they adhere to your religious
doctrine.  And I especially remember one Salvation Army in Chicago where we
shared space with a Jewish mother and her two little girls, but they sang,
we all sang, you had to fucking sing.  This isn't naive, this is survival.

They got their vote the way they wanted it.  The money is for the rich,
again.  They pilfer and rape our resources and make presidential candidates
take their eyes off the war yet again.  And I still say that unless EVERYONE
is brought to their knees nothing will be done.  The poor need enormous
numbers before a FDR steps up and does something.  And I'm voting for Obama,
but when I hear him talk about Welfare Reform (welfare for the poor that is)
there seems little help on the way.  700 billion in welfare for the rich
seems fine to Washington though.

Isn't that the aspiration of EVERY poetry anthology?  Usually people just
get pissed off about what's excluded; this is far more interesting.

hey i'll try adding "my" poem to my CV at "merit review" time to see if
i can actually cash in on it for a better raise...that would be really
great payback for having lent my name, however unwittingly, to this
enterprise. i was sorta flattered, like, now i'm a "real" poet if
someone's trying to fake me...

Dear friends & colleagues:

I'm very pleased to announce that this year's CPCW Fellow in Poetics &
Poetic Practice is *Rachel Levitsky*. She will teach a seminar called
"Writing Practice of the Avant-Garde or: Avant-Garde Hybrid Writing" and
at the Kelly Writers House will host the visits of several writers
associated with the course.

Rachel Levitsky's first full-length volume, /Under the Sun/, was
published by Futurepoem books in 2003. She is the author of five
chapbooks of poetry, /Dearly/ (a+bend), /Dearly 356/, /Cartographies of
Error/ (Leroy), /The Adventures of Yaya and Grace/ (PotesPoets) and
/2(1x1)Portraits/ (Baksun). Levitsky also writes poetry plays, three of
which (one with Camille Roy) have been performed in New York and San
Francisco. Levitsky's work has been published in magazines such as
/Sentence, Fence, The Brooklyn Rail, Global City, The Hat, Skanky
Possum, Lungfull!/ and in the anthology, /19 Lines: A Drawing Center
Writing Anthology/. She founded Belladonna--an event and publication
series for avant-garde poetics--in August 1999. A past fellow of The
McDowell Colony and Lower Manhattan Community Council, she teaches at
Pratt Institute and lives steps away from The Brooklyn Botanical Gardens.

Previous CPCW Fellows: Tracie Morris, Linh Dinh, Erica Hunt, and Kenneth
Goldsmith.

My initial response to being "included" in this was to ask to be removed.  =
 I've changed my mind.

I've only read a dozen or so poems in this=2C in addition to the one attrib=
uted to me.  I have to say that I like these poems.  Okay=2C what I've read=
 (so far) is only a nanofraction=3B still=2C I'm surprised that I don't fin=
d more fault in them=2C even given that minuscule percentage.

I have two thoughts on this.  First=2C this has to be the work of a single =
author=97 by which I mean a single individual or like-minded team=2C workin=
g with the aid of technology (or perhaps one of Jack Spicer's Martians=2C w=
ho gets no sleep).  My second thought is that I agree with whoever said tha=
t the most likely culprit is Kenneth Goldsmith.

Kudos then=2C somewhat grudgingly=2C to the perpetrator or perpetrators.

Strange, the formal, is it a salutation? on such a public=

Dear Dave,=0A=0AStrange, the formal, is it a salutation? on=A0such a public=
 space. & be warned, my spell check isn't working, not that I remember to u=
se it often, not good, no, not at all good enough, and I wish I had somethi=
ng to add about Bolano, but he's still on my 2 read list. As for translatio=
ns, I was suprised when Bernard Levy went on an extended riff about the Ame=
rican crime novelist James Ellroy in "American Vertigo." This wouldn't happ=
en in the States. Writers such as Ellroy or your favorite, Jim Thompson, ar=
en't fully appreciated in the States. & I'm also bereft of any language oth=
er than English. Which means I MUST trust the translator. What I'd give to =
be able to read Dante in Italian, Rilke in German, or Villon in French. Sti=
ll, this is America,=A0 we're supposed to be charmed by the likes of Sarah =
Palin also, don't you know, you should doggonit I do 2 and WHAT a great cou=
ntry it is don't you Forget=A0I know you've been to France and lots of othe=
r places,
 hey I'm ok with that -- it gets hard to understand our native speakers som=
etimes, know what I'm saying? You've clearly given this matter more thought=
 than I have. I've taken it as a given for some time that America is, if no=
t afraid of the other, at least suspicious of anything percieved as alien. =
& English is, I think, the most spoken language on the globe. Perhaps this =
will change as the dollar falls into whatever abyss awaits it. Your take is=
 far more complex than anything I have to say on the matter, however. Which=
 is why I'm going to have to read your post again and give it more thought.=

 Savage Detectives, and Last=0AEvenings on Earth, a collection of excellent=
 short stories. The first three=0Anamed, especailly, are profound explorast=
ions of the connections between=0Amodern poetry--and in Distant Star's case=

Night in Chile and Distant Star (itself=0Aa novella developed from the last=

 events and their aftermath, perhaps readers=0Ain the USA prefer to ignore =
them for the youth-notalgia of Savage=0ADetectives, which excludes the sini=
ster aspects of the times.=0A=0AThe house which figures in the final scenes=
 of By Night in Chile is being=0Aconsidered to be made a museum today in Ch=
ile, for in it a novelist and her=0AAmerican husband held the most glitteri=

Amy, I wonder if your "sunk into disappearance" is more than a bit strong,
similar to Ron Silliman's nearly threatening a lawsuit in his recent blog
entry.

I had thought about commenting on Ron's blog, then thought better of it, but
as I am again awash by the sea of (frequently silly, constantly
entertaining) commentary this item has created, I find myself again wanting
to respond, lest the mob gather itself too swiftly.  I wonder which 'author'
response has spooked Mr McLaughlin the most, which threat made him nearly
take down the project, tail between his foolish legs?  (Need I reference
Gatza's HCE anthology here?)

From mild amusement, to unintentionally evocative disdain, to supreme
financial retribution, to I DIDN'T WRITE THIS FUCKING GARBAGE! (the new I
HATE SPEECH?!), please, by all means, continue.

Subject:      new interactive audio piece: F8MW9

Here's a new work of interactive audio called F8MW9: http://vispo.com/mw .

You'll need the Shockwave plugin from http://vispo.com/sw if you don't
already have it installed.

Margareta Waterman did the audio and the "glyphs"; I did the concept,
programming, and design.

The main interactive controls:

1. The value that starts out at 1200 (milliseconds) determines
   the maximum duration of the audio samples. I suggest you
   gradually decrease this value down to 1, pausing to listen
   occassionally to hear the change in the audio. And then
   gradually increase the value.

2. Click the waveform or the area where the "glyphs" are displayed
   to make the audio commence at that point along the waveform
   representation of the audio.

3. Clicking the button with the rectangle and arrow on it changes
   the "glyph" that F8MW9 'draws'; there are 3 "glyph" drawings
   in each of the Shockwave pieces.

4. Clicking the button with the rectangle with an x through it
   clears the drawing area.

5. Clicking the infinity button causes the entire sound file
   to play from beginning to end (rather than shorter samples).

6. The round knob is a volume control

7. The wave-arrow button advances to the next Shockwave piece.

I could write several thousand words about what's going on in this piece,
but I'll spare you and leave it up to you to construct its meaning on your
own. Except to say you need to have it going for several minutes before the
'big picture' starts to emerge.

Many thanks to my dear friend Margareta Waterman for humouring me on this
one.

I am with Amy King, this is a mere Dadaist game, wonderful and playful. I
would have loved to have had a similar idea, Hopefully I will soon have One!

Just to make it clear: Robin Hamilton doesn't appear on the list of
"contributor" poets.

Perhaps if the process had been more competent, whatever it was,
Robin would be there too.

That's an easy dig, but I want to make it because this sort of
irritation is exactly the reason I think this was a worthwhile
project by whoever did it. I think it's also worthwhile that it made
Geraldine M. say that there are more important people to irritate.
Maybe there are, but then again, this is saying something about self-
worth, the value of poetry and so on. As previously noted, Geraldine
doesn't appear in it either.

I think it's even more interesting and more revealing that the crowd
over on harry-et tends more toward anger. That seems to me to jibe
with poetry-as-a-career, poetry-as-expression, and to fit less well
with the more open and odd and procedural poetics found on this list,
which has been more open to the humor in it.

Sure, the project may not be the bestest and smarterest thing ever
done, but it's provocative in ways that get people thinking about
poetic economies and the role of poets in society, and so on. It
reminds me a little of the Zurich Dada smartassery.

And yes, maybe I should recuse myself, because I did make whatever
cut the cyborg made.

Patrick,

I also wonder if you are willfully extracting a few of my words that clearl=
y imply this entire conversation will simply "disappear", as it surely will=
 in a week or so, and conflating my words with "threatening a lawsuit" out =
of some displaced need to defend the creators of this anthology ...?=A0 My =
entire statement is one of encouraging sentiment about the anthology, as is=
 my original blog post (http://amyking.wordpress.com/2008/10/04/the-author-=
resurrected/) , and to read otherwise smells of ulterior motive.

I have read many of the nasty comments as well in the various online venues=
 -- can't imagine how anyone can miss them -- but am a bit amiss that you c=
hose to read my own positive ones, using three extracted words, as negative=
.=A0 It is quite clear that you do not need to defend Stephen McLaughlin fr=
om me.=A0 The man himself has left a comment on my blog; he does not write =
as a threatened soul.=A0=20

As for defending him in general and the note that he might take the thing d=
own, I can't believe that anyone would attach poems with 3,000 poets who di=
d not write them and imagine only a hunky-dorey response.=A0 Of course ther=
e's going to be fall out, even if that "fall out" is a bunch of pissed off =
poets--but one hopes for more in the way of discussion/debate.=A0 That anyo=
ne would hope for otherwise is to live in on another planet.=A0=20

And that's just the point of the anthology, I speculate.=A0 Ownership and e=
gos would react first and generate conversation -- unless this is meant to =
be some huge and romantic kind of ode to all of the poets included (several=
 who aren't poets), this anthology is all about challenging lots of ideas a=
bout publishing, authorship, ownership, authority, anthologies, etc.=A0 Man=
y here have already noted, just by discussing this anthology's existence, w=
hat those issues are -- and beyond.=A0 To boil it down to me "threatening" =
the creators somehow is just downright disingenuous, detracts from the issu=
es raised, and does the creators no justice at all.=A0=20

Be well,

Amy

Amy, I wonder if your "sunk into disappearance" is more than a bit
strong,
similar to Ron Silliman's nearly threatening a lawsuit in his recent blog
entry.

I had thought about commenting on Ron's blog, then thought better of it,
but
as I am again awash by the sea of (frequently silly, constantly
entertaining) commentary this item has created, I find myself again wanting
to respond, lest the mob gather itself too swiftly.  I wonder which
'author'
response has spooked Mr McLaughlin the most, which threat made him nearly
take down the project, tail between his foolish legs?  (Need I reference
Gatza's HCE anthology here?)

From mild amusement, to unintentionally evocative disdain, to supreme
financial retribution, to I DIDN'T WRITE THIS FUCKING GARBAGE! (the new I
HATE SPEECH?!), please, by all means, continue.

Well, Google Alert let me know that I'm in this anthology (see:

=20

http://poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2008/10/3785_page_pirated_poetry_ant
ho.html)

=20

but of course my name appears below a poem I have not written. So am "I"
in this anthology?=20

=20

What I'm curious about is, first of all, if a poem of mine is in the
anthology sitting above someone else's name, and secondly, if not then
who wrote all this poetry-Kenneth Goldsmith?

Okay, someone signed as you, gave this blog address: http://vladdyzykovden.=
blogspot.com/, but their IP address is in Brooklyn.=A0 Go figure.

But the point remains, Steve McLaughlin doesn't strike me as someone gettin=
g scared enough to pull his anthology down due to angry responses, and mine=
 isn't one of them anyone, so cheers!

Thanks,
Amy

I'd hardly expect to -- I have neither blog nor homepage, and publish
relatively little online.

What caught my eye when this surfaced some weeks ago was the name of Dominic
Fox.

I was surprised, not because Dom isn't a good poet (I'm hoping to publish
his work eventually in Phantom Rooster Press) but because he isn't exactly
high profile.

I checked a number of names included against participants in the poetryetc
list, and there seemed to be three from there -- Halvard Johnson (though Hal
would qualify in various catagories), Andrew Burke and, Dom.  Possibly
others, but I didn't notice, but quite a few high profile names missing,
such as Alison Croggan, editor of _Masthead_.

(I used poetryetc as a test case simply because I know the list well enough
to judge, merit aside, the nature of the profile of the members of the list.
Anny Ballardini is also included in the compilation, but she tends not to
post poems to poetryetc.  The same relatively odd [arbitrary] selection of
names from New Poetry appeared.  The logic of the selection still intrigues
me.  Or the actual instructions given to the 'bot, and what it was sicked
on.)

So we aren't looking at a simple google trawl.

One suggestion that's come up is that the names were taken from blogger.com.

I don't think it matters much (other than the presence or absence of names
among the Favoured 3000 seems to correlate with neither merit nor
web-presence) except to suggest that the selection of names was done on the
cheap.

What disturbs me more is the apparently unironic approval of so many people
for the poems attached to their names that were produced by a text
generation engine.

This suggests that the response to what we have here is less to a dadaist or
Situationist manifestation than a return to the old Eliza program of the
sixties, when people were reluctant to admit that they were talking to a
singularly dumb computer program.

Mind you, as someone pointed out, given that the whole thing has gone viral,
it worked on that level.

> Perhaps if the process had been more competent, whatever it was,

I doubt it (see above).  I score higher on googlebooks (we all have our
little comfort blankets) than I do on plain vanila google.

> That's an easy dig,

Well, depends on what you mean by easy.  I did put a little work and thought
into it.  <g>

For anyone who's interested, from what I've seen, the discussion on New
Poetry tends to be the most technical in analysing the mechanism of how it
was done.

Nuff said.

I had a similar reaction. the pieces attributed to me do have
ELEMENTS that look like they might be related to me in some way. A
couple of the word choices do look a bit like something I might have
written.

Santa Claus is a pedophile and if I had kids he would be SHOT coming down

This is not a hoax, but neither is the anthology?

In Pennsylvania where I live we have the LEAST amount of paper trail for
election votes per voting machine per voter.  This is not a hoax, but so is
the anthology.

Crying and praying is the same release Joni Mitchess once sang, or something

Well -- thank you for your generally positive response (or at least not
aggressively negative, like some recent posts on the Poetry Foundation's
Harriet blog). For my part, I'm getting a good laugh out of this whole

Amy,

Thanks for your response. I had not read your blog entry, obviously, &
apologize for the stretching. I think my comment was much more colored
by Mr Silliman's, which upon reading again seems even stranger.

At the same time, all the net detective stuff seems overkill, from
your minor IP work to Ron's posting of Mr McLaughlin's address. Maybe
we could get his SS number too, & trash his credit rating as he has
trashed ours. Kidding, obviously.

Thank you for your response. As far as a 'displaced need', I take it
as a compliment.

Cheers,

Patrick

Children's Hour. Was exiled to L.A. at 16 & at 17 enrolled in an ongoing
academy w/ artists Wallace Berman, George Herms, Robert Alexander, Cameron;
migrated to San Francisco in l957 for higher education w/ peers & maestros
like Jack Spicer, Robert Duncan, Joanne Kyger, Diane DiPrima, Michael
McClure, Lew Welch, Philip Whalen, Jack Hirschman, a cast of thousands all
living extraordinary ordinary lives. Beat Thing [La Alameda Press, 2004] won
the Josephine Miles PEN Award, 2005. Was editor and interviewer for San
Francisco Beat: Talking With The Poets [City Lights, 2001]. With Steve

Selected Poems of David Meltzer by Viking/Penguin, a collection spanning
over forty years of work that paints a vivid portrait of Meltzer's life as a

versatile style and playful tone, Meltzer offers his unique vision of
civilization with a range of juxtapositions from Jewish mysticism and
everyday life to jazz and pop culture.

Michael Rothenberg is a poet, songwriter, and editor of Big Bridge magazine
online at www.bigbridge.org. His poetry books include Man/Woman, a
collaboration with Joanne Kyger, The Paris Journals (Fish Drum Press), Monk
Daddy (Blue Press), and Unhurried Vision (La Alameda/University of New
Mexico Press). His poems have been published widely in small press
publications including, 88: A Journal of Contemporary American Poetry,

He is also author of the novel Punk Rockwell. Rothenberg's 2005 CD
collaboration with singer Elya Finn, was praised by poet David Meltzer as
"fabulous-all [the] songs sound like Weimar Lenya & postwar Nico, lushly
affirmative at the same time being edged w/ cosmic weltschmertz. An
immensely tasty production." He is also editor for the Penguin Poet series,
which includes selected works of Philip Whalen, Joanne Kyger, David Meltzer
and Ed Dorn. He has recently completed the Collected Poems of Philip Whalen
for Wesleyan University Press.

To read poems by the authors go to WP's website:

--
Behind the storm of daily conflict and crisis, the dramatic confrontations,
the tumult of political struggle, the poet, the artist, the musician,
continues the quiet work of centuries, building bridges of experience
between peoples, reminding man of the universality of his feelings and
desires and despairs, and reminding him that the forces that unite are

Elizabeth you might have missed that I said brutal things happened to me and
my mother BECAUSE we were living in a car.  Things I didn't get into, nor
wish to.  Instead I brought up those who were generous, and those who were
generous were also poor.

In the end my point originally was, and continues to be that what we're
living in and living with is tantamount to complete madness.

I've been watching the Sunday morning journalists DEBATE over the debates
and DEBATE over the bail-out for Wallstreet.  What I keep hearing is
"construction is DOWN"  "we NEED to stimulate our economy with MORE
construction" ....

The idea of MORE is a form of madness.  We have enough.  We've had enough
for a very long time.  The idea of economic stimulation is totally bizarre
in a country which has a surplus of resources which often get burned,
dumped, housed in vaults (cheese for instance).

The Irish are pissing off the British with their INCREDIBLE offer to open
their banks with fixed protection, and now both McCain and Obama have called
to raise THOSE VERY STAKES by increasing America's 100,000 federal banking
protection to 250,000.

In the end nothing can protect us from the misery of polluted fresh water,
destroyed and fallow land, and a continued sense of MORE construction which
only continues to create more pollution, and in a time when more and more
people are homeless.

EXCITED for the math meant without abstraction the home run slide to the end
of all of this.  CARING PEOPLE are not people who chillingly pretend a
million deaths in Iraq are not everyone's responsibility.

I'm no longer EXCITED for the math as Washington proved its cowardice once
again.

We were on a roll, headed toward destruction of one system, a system which
rewards greed and murder and theft, to one where our government would be
FORCED to implement structures of aid to those who clearly need it the most.

FDR was brilliant because he saw how to offer aid for votes.  And I don't
care what motives he had so long as he helped the poor, which he did.
Neither of our 2-party candidates have offered substantial evidence that
they intend to help the poor in real ways.

What this anthology is to me about is the celebration of the internet. I
wonder what algorithm was used to arrive at the names of these poets.

 What everybody seems to be missing in all of this: I believe these poems
were written by a computer algorithm?

It seems to be a very sophisticated algorithm, written by somebody who "gets
it"; among other things, I am guessing it uses related groups of words
together as well as some ideas about poetic form.  Perhaps it is drawing
from our own poems as source texts?

Apparently it also passes the Turing Test, in that most people seem not to
notice that it was not written by a human.

Kudos to the programmers!  I've spent now several hours with the manuscript,
and am finding real poetry within it.

adam tobin

PS Also, if I am right about it being computer-generated -- especially if it
is using vocabulary and formal devices drawn from our actual poems -- it
seems perfectly appropriate to attribute these poems to "The Poetry
Community" (whatever that is: perhaps just a list of 3,147 names), rather
than, say, any one individual typist.

That attribution may also apply to the work we usually publish under our own
names, anyway.

per Charles McGrath in NYTIMES (Ideas and trends) today
The US is too insular to be considered for prize.  They don't translate
enough and "don't really participate in the big dialogue of literature."
 Claudio Magris, Adonis,Kadare mentioned as potential winners.

Submission call for Winter '08/'09:
For the winter themed section, we are looking for poetry about "travel" to cure us of our cabin fever. Send your submissions and a short bio in the body of an email  with "travel submission" in the subject line.

  Travel (Edna St. Vincent Millay)
The railroad track is miles away,
    And the day is loud with voices speaking,
Yet there isn't a train goes by all day
    But I hear its whistle shrieking.

All night there isn't a train goes by,
    Though the night is still for sleep and dreaming,
But I see its cinders red on the sky,
    And hear its engine steaming.

My heart is warm with friends I make,
    And better friends I'll not be knowing;
Yet there isn't a train I'd rather take,
    No matter where it's going.
  Also, we are looking for visual artists to be featured in the winter and future issues. If interested, send an inquiry with a link to samples of your work.

 All submissions should be sent to PJ Nights at tangerine_reflections@yahoo.com.

The thing is, the poems are all quite similar to each other. they're not
bad, but the similarity quickly makes the whole anthology a bit bland; i
guess this is part of the critique implied by the process as well as all
the other critiques people have mentioned.

i see jim carpenter is one of the 'editors'.=20

jim was at epoetry 2007 in paris. he showed us a program he is/was =
writing that writes poetry. what distinguished his approach was that he =
was primarily interested in trying to get the program to write =
'original', interesting poetry of the poemy poem variety. the poems were =
'based' on other texts (used them as 'seed' material), but the =
algorithms produced work that could include as much or apparently as =
little of the originals as one liked. so that the result could be made =
to 'stylistically' resemble the 'original' but otherwise not be =
particularly recognizable.=20

the poem in the anthology by 'me' doesn't have obvious relation to =
anything i've written.

if i recall correctly from epoetry 2007, his program was such that you =
could feed it several poems and then it would synthesize a new one =
'based on' what you fed it.

the programming is obviously relatively sophisticated; jim is a =
professional programmer. and is quite deeply immersed in these sorts of =
projects.

sort of a poetry synthesizer/sequencer.=20

i expect jim is the brains behind this project.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

This morning I was pleased to see that my friend Steve McLaughlin is
getting a lot of attention for his collaborative work Issue 1. I was
also pleased to discover that I am included in the anthology. Many
people are, understandably, unhappy. Depending on how one looks at it,
those included are either the recipients of a gift or victims. The
reaction seems rather split. Steve has more confidence than I do that it
will be able to remain on the web, but I am enjoying the dialog it has
triggered on its own page, Silliman's Blog, Amy King's Alias, and Harriet.

Issue 1 is edited by Steve and Jim Carpenter. The website lists Steve,
Vladimir Zykov, and Gregory Laynor as co-researchers. There seems to be
a lot of poor speculation about the authorship of the poems. For those
who are not familiar with Jim Carpenter or who won't take the five
minutes to research him, he is the creator of Erica T Carter or etc3, a
random poem generator. The poems attributed to the authors of Issue 1
are most likely randomly generated poems using this software or another
of Jim's creations.

The problem with this anthology is that it directly provokes an array of
actual authors. Personally, I am flattered to be included in this
anthology (no doubt because of my personal friendship with Steve), but I
do sympathize with those that are unhappy to have their names included.
My girlfriend, a law student not included in this anthology, has great
fear about the potential of the internet to invade privacy and hurt
reputations. Although I may not share these anxieties, I respect her
opinion and have learned from it. People may be genuinely upset when
false actions are attributed to them. So, in my opinion, this is a
rather disrespectful piece of art.

That disrespect will be a pro for some, a con for others. While this is
intentionally provocative, we must admit that the stakes are very small,
and anyone with half a brain or an internet connection will know that
these are unoriginal works. So what is the actual harm? Therefore, we
must also recognize Steve and Jim's bravado.

The merit of this piece results from the collision of theory and the
real world.We could use more of this interaction in almost every aspect
of our lives.

Thanks, Jim.

Actually, it seems to me that the poems have similies because to the
algorhythm designer, a simile is an easy to program phrase (throw in like!
throw in as!) that makes it seem like a poem, poetic language; the list
seems to be 1) a lot of POETICS list folks (easy to harvest from archives,
probably comprepoetica), 2) a lot of "very online" folks, 3) a lot of poets
who play with computer interference of various sorts, 4) dead folks with not
particularly litigious estates:  for 3000+ writers, seems like 3000+ of the
writers least likely to be freaked out.  Names from other poetry listservs
or just groups of other poets I know aren't there.

I'm sure I'm not the first to think of this, but it's pretty obvious
to me that the editors (or maybe their software) wrote the intro
(i.e. the 3,785 'poems') and we're all currently writing the actual
anthology, on this list and on Harriet. The e-mail/blog-comment
chapter has no problems of dubious authorship, unless any of us
besides Steve McLaughlin have been hacked in the recent past.

Of course it's obvious that it was computer-generated, if only because it i=

What fascinates me is the whole issue of intellectual property - as I
mentioned, I've found my work taken, rewritten, recontextualized,
reprinted, whatever - and that's great. If you're on the Web or for that
matter published in punk etc. stuff you should expect this. I fail to see
how any of our reputations are so precious that this is injurious -
instead, it's probably the best piece of Net literature (however def.)
that's come down the pike so to speak in a long while - it becomes a
rorschach test for just about everyone, including myself - a test not only
of our own reactions but the web. I admire this incredibly - so many
people have downloaded it! as opposed to downloading one or another
chapbook that seems somehow narrowed in relation to this ocean.

And the ocean of course reflects the Web/Net itself. I have a show up for
example on SL and other people have created interventions and you just
learn to deal with them - the net's porosity is only going to increase.

Re: Below - this anthology wouldn't have worked at all without either the
provocation or names of actual authors - that's the strength of it!

As far as the net invading privacy and hurting reputations - get used to
it; this happens to everyone who has much of an online presence. I think
of this action as a kind of creative commons at work - which includes as
some have pointed out - all these reactions.

And how is this invading privacy? My 'poem' (which I then sent out under
my own name) isn't telling any deep dark secrets or giving away tax
numbers, whatever. And how even plagiarism could hurt one's rep - I have
no idea, but it seems to go back to the usual romantic notions and
arguments about the inviolate author. There goes Lautreamont.

The list of names HAS in part to be from silliman's blog roll since i am on
that, i am in Issue 1, but have never had any other poetry published. (which
is a little funny i guess but pointless)... which means it's a lazy way of
doing it. why should i be in it?...

ANOTHER CUNY IS POSSIBLE!
#################

CUNY SOCIAL FORUM

@ CITY COLLEGE, OCT. 17-19th 2008

www.cunysocialforum.com

The CUNY Social Forum will be a gathering of students, faculty, staff
and alumni, of all CUNY campuses, who have come together to create a
more accountable, accessible, and democratic CUNY.   We want a CUNY
that is accountable to the students and surrounding NYC community,
accessible to all New Yorkers seeking higher education, and a CUNY
that is truly democratic, where students, faculty, and the community
have meaningful decision-making power.

The forum will feature workshops and panel discussion on a wide-array
of issues, including student movements (past and present) across
CUNY; institutional racism and unequal access to Senior Colleges; and
working for social justice in the classroom.  The many communities of
CUNY will be participating as well, discussing issues such as
housing, healthcare, human rights, the prison industrial and child
welafre complexes.  For a full list of workshops and panels, visit
our website and feel free to contact us cunysocialforum@gmail.com
with questions and concerns.

FDR put people into concentration camps and had food destroyed to drive up the prices during the Great Depression. That's what poor people need: higher food prices. Yet, that's what Obama promises: higher prices for everything. He's promising to raise taxes on corporations, which is a great idea if you want to raise prices on American-made goods, since that's what will happen. Corporations don't pay taxes, they just pass on the cost of taxes in higher prices. And if they can't do that, they will move someplace else where the cost of doing business is better, which will cost people jobs. The poor and the working classes are then hurt. Further, Obama has promised to raise tariffs. Great idea: raise prices once again on goods. Of course, that should make it easier for domestic companies to raise their prices once he raises their taxes. It will all get passed down to the poor. Personally, I don't like Obama's version of trickle down economics. But it
 certainly does sound like FDR. Of course, the tariffs that went up during the Great Depression were what drove Japan to go to war with the U.S. since they considered those tariffs to be an attempt by the U.S. to attack their economy. Who is Obama threatening with his tariffs?

Elizabeth you might have missed that I said brutal things happened to me and
my mother BECAUSE we were living in a car.  Things I didn't get into, nor
wish to.  Instead I brought up those who were generous, and those who were
generous were also poor.

In the end my point originally was, and continues to be that what we're
living in and living with is tantamount to complete madness.

I've been watching the Sunday morning journalists DEBATE over the debates
and DEBATE over the bail-out for Wallstreet.  What I keep hearing is
"construction is DOWN"  "we NEED to stimulate our economy with MORE
construction" ....

The idea of MORE is a form of madness.  We have enough.  We've had enough
for a very long time.  The idea of economic stimulation is totally bizarre
in a country which has a surplus of resources which often get burned,
dumped, housed in vaults (cheese for instance).

The Irish are pissing off the British with their INCREDIBLE offer to open
their banks with fixed protection, and now both McCain and Obama have called
to raise THOSE VERY STAKES by increasing America's 100,000 federal banking
protection to 250,000.

In the end nothing can protect us from the misery of polluted fresh water,
destroyed and fallow land, and a continued sense of MORE construction which
only continues to create more pollution, and in a time when more and more
people are homeless.

EXCITED for the math meant without abstraction the home run slide to the end
of all of this.  CARING PEOPLE are not people who chillingly pretend a
million deaths in Iraq are not everyone's responsibility.

I'm no longer EXCITED for the math as Washington proved its cowardice once
again.

We were on a roll, headed toward destruction of one system, a system which
rewards greed and murder and theft, to one where our government would be
FORCED to implement structures of aid to those who clearly need it the most.

FDR was brilliant because he saw how to offer aid for votes.  And I don't
care what motives he had so long as he helped the poor, which he did.
Neither of our 2-party candidates have offered substantial evidence that
they intend to help the poor in real ways.

There are some lists whose names --if one is upset about being in an
anthology of this kind--one may be glad not to find one's listed among--

as see the below video re prisons and prisoners in the USA from Brasscheck
TV and a little story that is true abt the creation of one form of an
anthology--as truly, think on how many are the infinite possibilities!  i
made a little zine anthology ages ago in which all the art work and writing
etc was done by quite different writers and artists--and al had interesting
names--and all of them were myself--

yet persons who purchased it were amazed at the variety of works
included--and the newness of these names--to their ears and eyes--and some
of the truly wild styles some had--
yes--did one ever tell them who the "real" "author" is?
why of course not!--
for were not as they made those pieces those people in a sense truly
existing and this is what gave such force and reality to their works--
yes
for --they had existed as they worked--and as they were read and looked at,
all these--
who?--

here is one way to make an anthology of the writings and writers of a city--

"The man had been a cab driver for twelve years in  Boston. He was an
amphetamine addict, a "speed freak."  Speed optimised  his efficiency and
endurance on the job.  As time and miles went by the taxi driver constructed
a vast system of references--a language--made up of the city's geography,
people's conversations and the signs he saw everywhere.  As addiction, time,
miles and signs accelerated it became evident that an apocalyptic crash was
imminent.  An uncanny conspiracy was afoot and the cab driver became wary of
each passenger who hailed him.  He never refused anyone a ride, because
anyone or everyone could supply information.  Finally the taxi driver
decided he had enough information to go to the authorities.  He went to the
FBI building at Government Center and told them a dangerous conspiracy was
threatening the whole city with chaos.  When asked for evidence the taxi cab
driver gave the agents the Boston Telephone Directory.
    --'All the names are here.'"

from "Heroin is King, Reagan is God"
by Chirot


There are many ways to make anthologies, many ways to find names and create
lists, and many a way also to "round up the usual suspects"--for a good old
rendition flight--
to the tropical islands!!
"Guantanamera!!--" ah the strains of that song echo out over the old
Guantanamo Bay, making the trees around the Famous Prison dance with the
maddening allure of swaying hips--
Ah!! where someday America will reinstall the true meaning of Cuba Libre as
just another wonderful drink at the very nice bars that line the newly
upholstered Havana of the wet dreams of "entrepreneurs" in al the world's
oldest and newest professions, with a few other variations added, "just to
celebrate,"-- behind the very tightly  closed doors, to be sure--!--yes--

For one may find in this atmosphere how prisons and anthologies, are they
not, are in many ways related,while appearing on the surface also not to be
so--

(the camouflage principle as used in literature--the uses of disguise,
undercover tricks--the aly allusion to the Trojan Horse!--) (I can see her
now, the Lenscrafter Lady of Liberty, winking, saying breathlessly, "you
betcha!")

On one side of the Bay the Prison and across from it, the Literary
Houses--where anthologies pour forth of the incredibly heteronymic array of
wildly varying in quality and style works of what is in fact a single very
patient poet, a very old ex-prisoner of Castro's who now makes up
anthologies of a Poetry which has never existed until now--with all the
patience of one who has spent eternities in the unlimited expanses of time
of sentences which were never throughly made clear--"incomplete sentences"
as the old prisoner poet thinks of them--in terms of that "grammatology of
correction" which he has also begun to create as he paints away at the final
images of the present collection--

if he cannot think of a name to affix to the poems and visual poems he is
providing for his poets, he simply picks up old tattered copies of long out
of date phone books, or the latest listings of names from the funeral
parlors, the dedications of military cemeteries or the colorful sobriquets
of the new breed of young professionals who sachet past him in the
shimmering heat--

yes, for a wonderful Yankee publisher and editor, the old man is creating a
whole fantasy world of Caribbean Poets, already to be packaged up and sent
off to Miami and broadcast from there to all the known corners of the Free
World, that giant sloppy and messily but cunningly inky octopus that has
being busy with its eight arms in enfolding al the forgotten and by passed
literaturess of previously "Unfree" peoples into its huge and heavy bosom, a
Bosom to end all Bosoms, as vast and mysterious as that of its mother, the
Sea--

The old ex-prisoner does this as he gazes out at the shining American prison
across the bay--
so much more up-to-date than his old huants!! so much improved it is said,
that he is very glad he was never sent there--

for will the world not always have prisons--just as much as poets--and may
not the anthologies have become confused--so that anthologies of poets are
of ones who should be in prison and those--as yet uncompiled anthologies--of
the prisoners--might they not be those of the real poets--
or in fact they might all be mixed up--and some belong here and others there
and stil others who knows might they not just be tossed iinto the shark
infested waters--or simply --left out, to wander aimlessly and without
knowing what kind of poetry they belong to until at last finding peace in a
nice shady grove or alcove or bar--

where someone is sure to find them and tell them just what kind of poetry
they are--

so one person's anthology is another's prison, and one person's prison is
indeed an anthology compiled by those who have been filling it with their
ideas of prisoners--

but then--

Ah!  to find one's name on yet another list, included in yet another
"collection," rounded up with the usual suspects, subjected to yet more
"harsh interrogations of the text," battered about by yet more "probing of
bodily embedded inscription and encryption cavities," to be stood naked
before the howling glistening healthy jowls of young men, women and dogs as
one's "gestural writings" are symbolically dismantled into the appropriate
forms for further deconstruction brought on by the application of the
electric "rock and roll" "Vitus' Dance"  torture, to be followed by the
"rosy fingered dawn" of the near drowning in the waters of Oblivion, those
perilous waters into which identity is thrust to the point almost of losing
its authorial being, and becoming yet another "anonymous Wall scribbler of
unspeakable perversity and criminality," yet another "forgotten writer" lost
in the sands of time . . .

Yes--to think on how many lists one' s name is found this whole wide world,
and in whose possesion!!

And then to see with whom else one is thrown into association with on these
lists!!

And never to be told the exact reason why!!

And, worse than that--to be "mis quoted!"  To have "one's words taken out of
context," or "right out of one's mouth," or--shoved into one's throat, words
to choke on, words to strangle with, words to carry one down to the depths
from which poetry springs forth as no more than the last screams of a once
human body . . . the finality of poetry's dying sounds in the stage setting
of death, surrounded by onlookers who are noting down the time it takes to
expire and fade away, whether it is with a a rattle or a whisper, a last
murmured prayer or simply the sound of air escaping the broken wind
pipe--the stove in ribs--the snapped spine--

Yes, think on how many anthologies one appears in already, as an "unknown"
person other than name numbers fingerprints dna samples voice prints video
surveillance images bank and credit print outs phone records police blotters
mentions in the high school paper mentions in the bulletin of the society
for the preservation of the such and such--think how many signatures of
yours exist in this world!--in so many different media and codes--how many
different images recordings and notations--how many records kept by ones one
never knew kept records--

and, as well, the invented records, if need be, the doctored photos, the
altered voice recordings, the slyly shifted statements given to a
conference, the mistranslated and distranslated versions of one's
pronouncements--
the "experimental writing exercises in translation" that have taken your
writings and turned them into a barrel of laughs or a symbol of the worn out
rag of the rag and bone shop where even the bones are laughing at the rag's
pitifullness--

Yes think on all these lists this wide world round and al the anthologies of
worst songs, worst baseball trades, best dressed emmy award winners, worst
dictators, best Marxists, the most fabulous and really swingin hot spots,the
very truest in its depiction of all narratives of the wars no one living has
ever seen--

Yes, so many lists and so many "anthologies" this wide world kept by so many
demographers politicos literary subscription sellers campaigns for such and
such and the lists just keep getting bigger and bigger and --

soon enough everyone living and dead is included in one huge anthology--if
only for a nanosecond--

before the next death and birth have altered it--and who shall cry out for
the unborn writers and poets? and who shall mourn those dead before their
time? and what abt those writers who never wrote a word yet were the living
flower of poetry itself--

what is Poetry itself were to miraculously appear in Judgement and looking
around--be bitterly disappointed!! enraged--or bursting at the seams with
laughter!
and were to say in a very loud voice
O Poets--how many of you there are that in my name are always  already
writing  fake poetry?

Why how very very few there are after al that are writing Real Poetry--!!
Would not that Poetry be charged and demolished!!

Would not Poetry also be cast into those Guantanamos and Abu Ghraibs, those
Bagrams, where are created the latest productions of the "New Extreme
Experimental American Poetry and Arts--"--

Or perhaps kept at home in the Homeland Security of the World
's most emprisoned population--?

FROM BRASSCHECK TV, 5 Ocotber 2008:

David

The US has a higher percentage of its population
behind bars than any other country in the world:
more than China, more than Russia, more than any
backwater dictatorship.

Roughly 1 out of every 142 US residents is behind bars.

This gulag system is fantastically profitable for
the companies that build and manage prisons...for
the companies that supply them...for the prison
guard unions...and for the state itself which sells
prison labor to private corporations for pennies on
the dollar.

Who are these two million plus people behind bars
in the US?

Are they all monsters the public has to be
protected from or has incarceration become
an addictive business for the state?

Is that's the case, how safe are any of us
in the long run?

These are questions a freedom loving people
should be asking
itself.

Nice to know that we can leave the fate of the poor in the hands of
those generous rich people, who so nicely provide jobs and housing for
everyone.

Now, I've got nothing personally against the rich. Or even the
moderately rich. But it would be nice to see some perception of how
much damage all-out corporatism and global finance has done to the
lifestyles of the poor and unknown all around the globe. Not to
mention the millions of species that are presently being wiped out,
due to pollution and unregulated development and everything that
follows on from that. Money is only interested in money. Maybe some
questioning on the place of the so-called "defence" industry and its
effects, politically, environmentally, socially? Or is terminal
naivety the order of the day?

From the Harriet Blog this a.m. --=20

I received the following email from Stephen McLaughlin this afternoon, who =
asked me to post this here:

"One morning about a month ago, I received a message from the
Poetics List that began something like 'Announcing Issue 1 of Broken
Caterpillar. Featuring new poems by . . . followed by a list of 45
poet's names. I'd seen one of them on Silliman's blogroll, but the rest
were just flat names. Barely names -- ethereal text strings. Keep in
mind that I receive hundreds of these announcements per year.

 I view it that way too and do have the feeling that it throws up interesting theoretical issues about authorship in the Age of the Computer/Web. Moreover, it does, in a very funny way, write for those of us who may be experiencing the "writer's block"! This is not being cynical; I'm dead serious!

What everybody seems to be missing in all of this: I believe these poems
were written by a computer algorithm?

It seems to be a very sophisticated algorithm, written by somebody who "gets
it"; among other things, I am guessing it uses related groups of words
together as well as some ideas about poetic form.  Perhaps it is drawing
from our own poems as source texts?

Apparently it also passes the Turing Test, in that most people seem not to
notice that it was not written by a human.

Kudos to the programmers!  I've spent now several hours with the manuscript,
and am finding real poetry within it.

adam tobin

PS Also, if I am right about it being computer-generated -- especially if it
is using vocabulary and formal devices drawn from our actual poems -- it
seems perfectly appropriate to attribute these poems to "The Poetry
Community" (whatever that is: perhaps just a list of 3,147 names), rather
than, say, any one individual typist.

That attribution may also apply to the work we usually publish under our own
names, anyway.

i see jim carpenter is one of the 'editors'.

jim was at epoetry 2007 in paris. he showed us a program he is/was writing that writes poetry. what distinguished his approach was that he was primarily interested in trying to get the program to write 'original', interesting poetry of the poemy poem variety. the poems were 'based' on other texts (used them as 'seed' material), but the algorithms produced work that could include as much or apparently as little of the originals as one liked. so that the result could be made to 'stylistically' resemble the 'original' but otherwise not be particularly recognizable.

the poem in the anthology by 'me' doesn't have obvious relation to anything i've written.

if i recall correctly from epoetry 2007, his program was such that you could feed it several poems and then it would synthesize a new one 'based on' what you fed it.

the programming is obviously relatively sophisticated; jim is a professional programmer. and is quite deeply immersed in these sorts of projects.

Poverty is the natural state of things in the world for humans. Wealth is what is unusual. We need to stop asking what causes poverty and ask instead what causes wealth if we really, truly want to help the poor. Historically it has been free markets creating wealth, not government. Government has historically gotten wealthy through theft and threats. You will find no friend of government here -- whether it is through the wrong-headedness of the welfare state or the "defense industry." The countries with the freest markets all have the cleanest environments, while those with strong central governments controlling everything -- the former Eastern Bloc, the U.S.S.R. and now China -- have been the biggest polluters. Go to a city in a poor country and you will see unbelievable pollution everywhere. Not that we can't do better, as we certainly can, but the first thing we need to do is acknowledge reality in the world before we can proceed to improve the world.
 Naivety and ignorance are two very dangerous things, and cause more harm than good. They're as dangerous as the good intentions that flow out of them. Good intentions minus an understanding of reality is what keeps poor people poor in this world. At least, I like to think that that's what's going on, because otherwise it means that the Left are diabolical.

Nice to know that we can leave the fate of the poor in the hands of
those generous rich people, who so nicely provide jobs and housing for
everyone.

Now, I've got nothing personally against the rich. Or even the
moderately rich. But it would be nice to see some perception of how
much damage all-out corporatism and global finance has done to the
lifestyles of the poor and unknown all around the globe. Not to
mention the millions of species that are presently being wiped out,
due to pollution and unregulated development and everything that
follows on from that. Money is only interested in money. Maybe some
questioning on the place of the so-called "defence" industry and its
effects, politically, environmentally, socially? Or is terminal
naivety the order of the day?

wow, the list hasn't been this hoppin' in years!
reminds me of my father's old quip: "We haven't had this much fun since
the rats ate the baby." Usually i only get to use that line at
department meetings.

However funny (offendingly funny, so to speak)as it may seem, I find it hard
to dissuade myself from an awkward thought of late. Especially after hearing
Sarah Palin's English pronounciation of names of certain countries during
last Thursday's Vice Presidential debate.

In any country as racially diverse as the USA, language accent undoubtedly
reflects the nature of the demographics. That's a given. However, in the
recent times, names of countries beginning with the letter "I" are
pronounced in a manner that almost invariably seems to reveal the speakers
feelings (or political opinion) about those countries. This might be of
interest to linguistic anthropologists. My personal polling has shown this
to be more of a problem with the very right-wing Republican tongue.

Anyway, the issue is this - many Americans tend to pronounce Iraq and Iran
as I-raq ("eye-raq") [instead of "ee-raaQ" which is  the correct accent] and
I-ran ("eye-raN") [instead of ee-raaN], whereas ally's and friends are
called Israel (ee-sraayel) and/or India (ee-ndia).

Of course why the margin of accentual error is so narrow in the case of
"Ireland" is another story and since most of us are totally nonchalant about
a country called "Iceland", we tend to pronounce the name conventionally.

As an American who spends much time in a lefty academic bubble,
I hear short-I for Iran and Iraq almost exclusively;
but I also hear short-I for India and Israel, exclusively.

You've noted a long-I pronunciation of India and Israel among (conservative)
Americans?  I'm both fascinated and skeptical....

I was also observing that it is funny that the anthology appeared when the
financial markets are eating down the meager earnings of working people.
What a coincidence, anybody knows better?

My friend Eric Rosenfield is in it and is not a poet, so I bet he
wouldn't mind if you swipe the minimalist ditty of his.

The left is more diabolical than the right? They both have their
monsters. And I'm not so certain that "left" and "right" mean much any
more (though I'm noticing an interesting nascent post-communist
marxism cropping up here and there). Democratic governments across the
west are steadily heading towards police states in the service of
corporate power - what else is the US government about these days? Is
Blackwater such a marvellous thing, really, that massive privatisation
of state violence? Rampant development is probably responsible for
most mass species extinction, and that occurs everywhere, not just in
the grim tips of Eastern Europe and Asia. Look at the recent figures
on the declining populations of common birds (or bees or frogs) across
the globe, including the UK (where animal populations are in serious
decline), the US and Australia.

And from Tamberlaine on, people have accumulated huge amounts of
wealth through pillaging the goods and labour of others. No mystery
there. Corporations are no different. All that pollution in the
"developing world" is our factories at work, without those pesky
government regulations that make it so inconvenient and expensive in
our own backyard.

We need to stop asking what causes poverty and ask instead what causes wealth if we really, truly want to help the poor. Historically it has been free markets creating wealth, not government. Government has historically gotten wealthy through theft and threats. You will find no friend of government here -- whether it is through the wrong-headedness of the welfare state or the "defense industry." The countries with the freest markets all have the cleanest environments, while those with strong central governments controlling everything -- the former Eastern Bloc, the U.S.S.R. and now China -- have been the biggest polluters. Go to a city in a poor country and you will see unbelievable pollution everywhere. Not that we can't do better, as we certainly can, but the first thing we need to do is acknowledge reality in the world before we can proceed to improve the world.

Good intentions minus an understanding of reality is what keeps poor people poor in this world. At least, I like to think that that's what's going on, because otherwise it means that the Left are diabolical.

in minnesota, the long-I for Italian and even Tibetan (!) are very
common. I've even heard eye-talian from waiters in supposedly Italian
restaurants. The news that this is an ethnic slur has not reached the
great midwest, apparently.

I am caught between loving this anthology and dismissing the idea of it.

I love it because it's more comprehensive than any poetry anthology
around...compared with Norton, this anthology is grandisimo!

I initially dismissed it; I find generated poetry only as interesting as our
expectations. The Sarah Palin of poetry....generated poetry is cool because
our expectations of it are low. This poetry is better than we think it could
be. Hell, sometimes it's better than our own poetry is, but that's not
really good enough, for me, at least. I like the errors, the "mistakes" in
human poetry. Irony and bathos in generated poetry don't seem as funny.

With generated work, "wonder effect" never lasts long.

Or go back to Bresson why models, virginal inside and mechanical outside,
are better actors than actors.

Here is the poem that "I" (vis-a-vis Ann Margaret Bogle) did not write  for the anthology, Issue 1:

Like a delight

Will he be black?
He will scream,
"I will long for
to will  glide
angrily"
This stream may stride and glare, but
it is angrily  meagre
A sort of wall
A kind of invasion
A sort of delight
A kind of  eye
Lustre is so motionless
it will quiver you
As if he will be steady,  turning,
laying, like a use.
He will be shiny, his  terrible
droop

The long I is very difficult to pronounce after n in India and almost as
difficult after s in Israel.
As much as politics, I think the distinction has to do with the education
level of the speaker. Most soldiers pronounce Irak with the long I. I wonder
if one does not know that Iraq and Iran are pronounced with the short I one
instinctively extrapolates from Ireland which is the more familiar word.

Troy,
I sometimes wonder if you are for real. Next you will introduce the term
"the deserving poor." Do you remember that one from Ricardo's "dismal
science."

As for "naivete and ignorance," are you referring to all genius Ceo's who
got us into this mess?

Elizabeth, don't forget that your fictional self is an amalgam of the
fictive and the real and that reality swallows a good dose of the fictional
before it sets off for the day. Strangeness is, of course, relative, ranging
between the unorthodox and the truly weird and varying in efficacy according
to one's breadth of experience. Your fictional self has a good measure of
you, so don't be too liberal with it and some people are into really weird
things so your strange might well be commonplace to them.  Have a sublime
but not too uncanny day.

Life being short, poverty and wealth
      are final verdicts, in that
 poverty and life are of equal duration
      and wealth and cold indifference
are perennial and hereditary, like diseases.

    (from /May, Eternal/, 1988, tr. by Anselm Hollo)


And, briefly:
The old part (1754-1762) is known as
The Winter Palace.
Accordingly everything,
Floor, ceiling, walls
Is covered with these exalted beings:
Venus, Jupiter, many ladies
Of a full-bodied vintage.
You can still see how many a man
Lost head and hat
By the Berezhina River,
You can see that Borodino
Was a victory;


Of such
I'm talking, here,
Under the roof
Thatched by my hair.

    (from /The Winter Palace/, 1959, tr. by Anselm Hollo)

I've been meaning to keep out of this but I've been genuinely surprised at
the response from lots of poets here.  Many of you seem more than happy to
have your names attached to something a computer wrote.  I just find this
extremely weird.  I can't honestly see the satisfaction gained but I'm not
disputing it because obviously much satisfaction has been gained.  But I
can't get to the nub of why this should be because it's the very act of
writing poetry that gives satisfaction - apart from book production which I
find integral to heart of  poetry.  The rest of it - putting your name to
it, getting it 'out there' is just the mechanics of transmission, and the
mechanics of transmission can be very rather tedious!

I certainly accept that something like this could act as a trigger for some
poets to develop work from it but if the satisfaction is merely to see your
name on a poem you didn't write then I'm totally mystified.

Why I saw Obododimma reply it intensified my mystification because I was
delighted when someone had gone to the effort to find out I wasn't included.
I couldn't get up the enthusiasm to check it out myself and somewhat dreaded
being there. My name is who I am and I don't relinquish that lightly.

Anyway I might be wrong in this but could we be seeing a real shift (or even
rift) in attitudes between younger and older poets?  Many of you will have
been brought up with computer and be totally at ease with the computer age
with its impersonal and intrusive ways. Whereas poets of my generation (I'm
56) were brought up in a very very private word, without television
(although they were just about beginning to infiltrate the homes)
telephones (public ones would be streets away  if you knew anyone who had a
phone to ring! - everyone wrote letters) - and of course no fridges, cars
and all the other things we take for granted.  Apart from the radio which
was the main source of entertainment our known world was a small pocket of
our neighbourhood.  The pace of change has been phenomenal and much of it
for the better but it has been at the cost of our privacy.  In a way it's a
matter of what you don't know you don't miss.  I think a lot of poets of my
generation know what real privacy was so we have something to compare it
to - and that comparison can be alarming.

Obviously I can't check out my 'age theory' in relation to the 'anthology'
but I wonder if this is a salient factor in all our attitudes towards this.
Just a thought.

Geraldine

TEN YEARS AGO TONIGHT...






...Matthew Shepard was driven out to a fence on the outskirts of Laramie,
Wyoming and tortured and beaten and left to suffer and fight for his life
until found by another young man on his bicycle.

TEN YEARS AGO TONIGHT, after torturing Shepard, and beating him over and
over with his pistol, Aaron McKinney would decide to go back into town, go
to a bar, get into a fight with a man much bigger than himself and be beaten
so badly that he would also wind up in the emergency room three beds away
from Matthew Shepard. Shepard would die five days later.

TEN YEARS LATER, queer teens still have the highest suicide rate. Queers of
all ages, but especially African American transgendered people, continue to
be murdered more than any other group.  No one else I knew had the stomach
for keeping track of this carnage like my friend, our friend,
poet/artist/musician kari edwards.  Up to the day she died she maintained
blogs with the most harrowing evidence, which you can see
HERE: http://transdada.blogspot.com/
and
HERE: http://transdada3.blogspot.com/<http://transdada3.blogspot.com/">HERE</a>

There is a presidential debate tonight, a debate which will be going on
almost at the exact same time Matthew Shepard was being tortured and beaten
to death for being queer.  Let's see if Obama and McCain mention Shepard, or
use queers so callously as did Biden and Palin at their recent debate.

3 times, actually. I think it's because JF J.F. and J F looked like
different names to the cleaning algorithm. still i'll take the top

No, I didn't mean that. Like you, I haven't, and I am just trying to amuse
myself with the thought that may be the short-i sound breeds
familiarity....those nations are seen as friendlier than the long-I nations.

"eye-talian" sounds even more funnier. That proves my postulate wrong, I
guess, to a great relief.

in minnesota, the long-I for Italian and even Tibetan (!) are very
common. I've even heard eye-talian from waiters in supposedly Italian
restaurants. The news that this is an ethnic slur has not reached the
great midwest, apparently.

I am not a linguistic expert, so feel free to disagree.

I have a problem with associating people's language patterns or accents wit=
h anything besides region or possibly socio-economic position. To suggest t=
hat these patterns "reveal" people's prejudices seems to inscribe our own p=
rejudices on others. People tend to pronounce words the way that others in =
their community pronounce them. To condemn entire communities based on thei=
r language patterns or accents seems to me a form of elitism and prejudice.

I was talking to my mother about this the other day. She's 60 and was
remarking at how little I cared about my name appearing on things
like this anthology. My response is that my name has very little to
do with me. It's a series of sounds and/or letters that is used to
designate me, and that i use to identify things that i've written,
but beyond that? it isn't much of anything. by publishing, which was
a choice that I made, i put my name OUT THERE. and i think that part
of the generational difference that you may be talking about here is
a different conception of what OUT THERE means. the public space of
the internet, and of discourse, is one where Identity has very little
to do with one's name and much more to do with ones actions. this
anthology, because it's clearly computer generated, and because the
way the names were presented were en masse in a sort of storm of
names is very different from the sort of thing i might object to,
such as someone specifically using my name to endorse something i
disagree with or using my bio to try to get crappy poems published.
There is no action attributed to me in my name's inclusion in this
thing. The only thing that my name being included in this says about
me is that I have a minor public presence as a writer, which fact is
the result of intentional action on my part. the project itself, as a
commentary on the field and as a utilization of machine generated
poetry, is worthy and as such I don't really see anything
objectionable about it at all. what you're calling real privacy to me
looks like something that is either illusory or an over strong
definition. a rose is a rose is a rose, and no number of garbage
poems about roses have ever diminished the rose from being a
beautiful flower. just the same, a JF Quackenbush is a JF Quackenbush
is a JF Quackenbush, and attributing a computer generated poem or
poems to JF Quackenbush says nothing about me or my work. so why
should it bother me?

I am just not amused. I understand the avant-garde-ness of it, thew
questions of authorship I was so entranced by in college, etc.

But mostly, I am pissed because I work very hard not to produce suck ass
poems. Most certainly, I keep my suck-ass poems locked away in a vault on my
hard drive which will hopefully never see the light of day.

So Silliman has the email address of the "compiler": fakesalt@comcast.net

I'm sending an email noting my desire not to be associated with bad poetry.
I have no real issue with the "idea", aside from the fact that no one gets
to say, "Yes, count me in".

Anyhow.

Well, I'm younger (though not quite young enough to have been brought
up with computers), but still hear-hear what you say, Geraldine.

Just because so many people have downloaded it -- out of little more
than curiosity at whether they or their friends are included --
doesn't seem as incredibly meaningful as some have said! Harmless fun,
perhaps, loaded with a little bit of a subversive message regarding
intellectual property/authorial vanity, but deserving of such
admiration?

Don't know of any "deserving poor." I just know that if you look at the world historically, you will see that the majority of people have been poor during that time. Go back far enough, and everyone was poor. But only if you take an evolutionary-anthropological view of things. I find it hillarious that the Left is always attacking religious people for believing in creationism, but then deny historical, anthropological, or evolutionary facts because those facts conflict with their ideologies.

As for the CEOs, I do include them with those on the Left, as if you learn who these CEOs were, they were on the Left. The seeds for this mess were planted in the very creation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac insofar as it resulted in the separation of those who sold the mortgages and those who owned them. This set it up for the Clinton administration to first push the CEO of Fannie Mae at the time, Franklin Raines, to encourage mortgages brokers to start offering mortgages to people without money or a job. Bush also liked the idea of home ownership for everyone, so he continued pushing this ridiculous plan. Naturally, people without jobs or money can't pay their mortgages, so they began defaulting, driving housing prices down. As housing slowly became devalued, the housing market dried up. More defaults resulted in banks and places like Fannie Mae owning houses rather than getting the money they were owed, and as a consequence, we are in this mess.

Troy,
I sometimes wonder if you are for real. Next you will introduce the term
"the deserving poor." Do you remember that one from Ricardo's "dismal

As for "naivete and ignorance," are you referring to all genius Ceo's who

Just because I find the Left despicable, that doesn't mean I like the Right, either. False dichotomy -- as you go far enough to the Right or the Left, and they end up being the same things (Naziism and Communism behaved almost identically). I'm a free market supporter, which isn't ideological at all, because saying you support a naturally-occurring human system like free market economies is much like saying you support the existence of deserts in the world along the 30th parallel. The pollution in the developing world is occurring not because of corporations per se, but because the governments there are socialist kleptocracies more interested in robbing the people than in providing the kinds of institutions (rule of law with independent judiciaries, property rights protections, etc.) which have proven everywhere they are tried to life the poor out of their poverty.

The left is more diabolical than the right? They both have their
monsters. And I'm not so certain that "left" and "right" mean much any
more (though I'm noticing an interesting nascent post-communist
marxism cropping up here and there). Democratic governments across the
west are steadily heading towards police states in the service of
corporate power - what else is the US government about these days? Is
Blackwater such a marvellous thing, really, that massive privatisation
of state violence? Rampant development is probably responsible for
most mass species extinction, and that occurs everywhere, not just in
the grim tips of Eastern Europe and Asia. Look at the recent figures
on the declining populations of common birds (or bees or frogs) across
the globe, including the UK (where animal populations are in serious
decline), the US and Australia.

And from Tamberlaine on, people have accumulated huge amounts of
wealth through pillaging the goods and labour of others. No mystery
there. Corporations are no different. All that pollution in the
"developing world" is our factories at work, without those pesky
government regulations that make it so inconvenient and expensive in
our own backyard.

We need to stop asking what causes poverty and ask instead what causes wealth if we really, truly want to help the poor. Historically it has been free markets creating wealth, not government. Government has historically gotten wealthy through theft and threats. You will find no friend of government here -- whether it is through the wrong-headedness of the welfare state or the "defense industry." The countries with the freest markets all have the cleanest environments, while those with strong central governments controlling everything -- the former Eastern Bloc, the U.S.S.R. and now China -- have been the biggest polluters. Go to a city in a poor country and you will see unbelievable pollution everywhere. Not that we can't do better, as we certainly can, but the first thing we need to do is acknowledge reality in the world before we can proceed to improve the
 world.

Good intentions minus an understanding of reality is what keeps poor people poor in this world. At least, I like to think that that's what's going on, because otherwise it means that the Left are diabolical.

Geraldine,

I write to you as a huge fan of your work -- I first saw you read in
London in '86, in connection (I think, if memory serves) with
MHorovitz's Grandchildren of Albion anthology -- and with no
disrespect whatsoever.  In your post, you wrote:

> But I can't get to the nub of why this should be because it's the
> very act of writing poetry that gives satisfaction

Indeed.  So much so that having a little hoax poem (or two or three)
with one's name on it included among over 3,000 other little hoax
poems could/should never detract from that.  There's no real
satisfaction to be gained from seeing one's name on a poem one didn't
write (sometimes there's no satisfaction from seeing one's name on a
poem one did  write!).  There's a giggle, yeah, at the joke -- that
the poems are so obviously not the work of the many, many poets whose
names are affixed to them --  but a giggle's not satisfaction.  Okay,
sometimes it can be, but I think not in this case.

The anthology has certainly revealed a lot of very interesting
attitudes (about, for one thing, litigation) among certain poets, and
maybe that's its "value."  But what you wrote here is the most cogent
thing, in my opinion, anyone's said about it:

> could we be seeing a real shift (or even rift) in attitudes between

There has definitely been a shift in the way I configure time in my
own brain, and the presence of a computer has contributed to that.  I
KNOW that the computer, as a kind of outside-the-body brain, has
changed poetry.  In my own life it is intrusive, but at the same time
an interesting tool -- and there's the slippery slope.  And if we
slip, do we cling onto something, or let go and see where we land?
Either way, it might hurt.

x, Sharon Mesmer

I obviously can't speak for anyone else on the subject of why they may be so
pleased to find somebody else speaking on their behalf -- In my own instance, I
thought it hilarious to find a (not so bad) poem attributed to Aldon Lynn
Nielsen -- a name that has never appeared on a poetry publication in the past

It may be generational, but I doubt it. I think the divide here has a
couple of sources. I do think it's important to distinguish between
the pleasure of the reader and the pleasure of the creator. I suspect
many people who are happy with the poem attributed to them are happy
as readers. There may be a few who look at the poem attributed to
them as a piece of found art, and that's a sort of authorship, no
doubt, although it doesn't fit the sort of writing experience you
describe.

Anyway, here's a list of all the various positions or motivations I
could come up with. It's by no means exhaustive. I tried to be fair,
but no doubt I slipped in a dig or two despite myself.

There are people who, perhaps like yourself, see the computer as an
agent rather than a tool. This is one reason why I think things like
the Turing Test keep arising.

Some people are unhappy because they see poetry as one of the great
humanist endeavours. That it, like opposable thumbs, are part of what
makes us truly human. They tend to talk about soul, meaning, and
Turing Tests.

There are people who are invested in such methods of creation and who
see the computer as a tool, like a typewriter. This may speak to the
divide you identify.

There are people who are invested in control more than others. That
is, some of the folks outraged also don't place value in things like
automatic writing, chance operations, and so on.

Conversely, there are people who get very excited (in a happy,
appreciative way) about found work, chance operations, computer-
generated texts, and so on.

Some may think of this as a sort of mechanical muse and that the
poets' names listed here have a status similar to those real frogs in
Moore's imaginary garden or Lorca in Spicer's After Lorca.

There are also people who feel that their name/brand is threatened by
such activities. They therefore see this as fraud, theft, or some
other threat to the value of their name and, possibly, to the real
income it generates. I know at least two major poets have made it
know that this is the issue for them.

There are people who see this as part of a disruption of subjectivity
and who value it as a prompt to think about what it means to be an
author.

There are others who see it as a threat to their author-ity as the
creator. This is starting to overlap, but I want to make the
distinction.

Some people would be okay with this project if the poem attributed to
them or to some they like weren't what they consider a bad poem.

Others would be proud to call the poem the product of their own
labor. (There may even be those who would be happy to have a
published book or two regardless of having written it themselves or
not.)

I bet others can add more to this list, and I'd be grateful if
someone did. I think all of these are valid positions, but I disagree
with some of them.

"Artworks synthesize ununifiable, nonidentical elements that grind away at
each other; they truly seek the identity of the identical and the
nonidentical processually because even their unity is only an element and
not the magical formula of the whole." -Theodor Adorno, Aesthetic Theory

Theorizing the system as a poetic is explicitly a practice of theorizing the
collective. In producing a journal based on this understanding, the aim of
W+S has been to negate the glossy individualism of poetry as such. For issue
#2, former contributors were invited to also be editors, tagging poets whose
work they admired; the connections spiraled out dialectically, creating a
dynamic and living process, one that is unified to the precise degree it
negates unity. The grinding is the core project.

Tonight, W+S#2 contributor Meg Hamill is part of the State of the Union
reading at Pegasus in downtown Berkeley. The first copies of #2 will make
their way into the world from there.

Onward,,,

Dan/W+S

It may be generational, but I doubt it. I think the divide here has a
couple of sources. I do think it's important to distinguish between
the pleasure of the reader and the pleasure of the creator. I suspect
many people who are happy with the poem attributed to them are happy
as readers. There may be a few who look at the poem attributed to
them as a piece of found art, and that's a sort of authorship, no
doubt, although it doesn't fit the sort of writing experience you
describe.

Anyway, here's a list of all the various positions or motivations I
could come up with. It's by no means exhaustive. I tried to be fair,
but no doubt I slipped in a dig or two despite myself.

There are people who, perhaps like yourself, see the computer as an
agent rather than a tool. This is one reason why I think things like
the Turing Test keep arising.

Some people are unhappy because they see poetry as one of the great
humanist endeavours. That it, like opposable thumbs, are part of what
makes us truly human. They tend to talk about soul, meaning, and
Turing Tests.

There are people who are invested in such methods of creation and who
see the computer as a tool, like a typewriter. This may speak to the
divide you identify.

There are people who are invested in control more than others. That
is, some of the folks outraged also don't place value in things like
automatic writing, chance operations, and so on.

Conversely, there are people who get very excited (in a happy,
appreciative way) about found work, chance operations, computer-
generated texts, and so on.

Some may think of this as a sort of mechanical muse and that the
poets' names listed here have a status similar to those real frogs in
Moore's imaginary garden or Lorca in Spicer's After Lorca.

There are also people who feel that their name/brand is threatened by
such activities. They therefore see this as fraud, theft, or some
other threat to the value of their name and, possibly, to the real
income it generates. I know at least two major poets have made it
know that this is the issue for them.

There are people who see this as part of a disruption of subjectivity
and who value it as a prompt to think about what it means to be an
author.

There are others who see it as a threat to their author-ity as the
creator. This is starting to overlap, but I want to make the
distinction.

Some people would be okay with this project if the poem attributed to
them or to some they like weren't what they consider a bad poem.

Others would be proud to call the poem the product of their own
labor. (There may even be those who would be happy to have a
published book or two regardless of having written it themselves or
not.)

I bet others can add more to this list, and I'd be grateful if
someone did. I think all of these are valid positions, but I disagree
with some of them.

@Ryan,
I have this strange feeling a computer program would make just as many
compositional "mistakes" as a human poet. Perhaps we could devise some sort
of poetical Turing test to tell the difference. Which raises the issue of
what to call it--a Homer Test? A RACTER test? A W(h)it-mus test--like
measuring acid, but cleverer, with a beard?

This "fake anthology" and the question of "stolen" or "invented" identity it has raised would certainly be useful to me in developing the concept of the "indivirtual", which I tried to play with sometime ago but only succeeded in publishing a rather starved essay on my blog:

http://obododimma.livejournal.com/#entry_640
I think I have got very relevant data now from "fake anthology" and from those who have been writing in.

I've been meaning to keep out of this but I've been genuinely surprised
at=20
the response from lots of poets here.  Many of you seem more than happy to=
=20
have your names attached to something a computer wrote.  I just find this=
=20
extremely weird.  I can't honestly see the satisfaction gained but I'm
not=20
disputing it because obviously much satisfaction has been gained.  But I=20
can't get to the nub of why this should be because it's the very act of

writing poetry that gives satisfaction - apart from book production which I=
=20
find integral to heart of  poetry.  The rest of it - putting your name to=
=20
it, getting it 'out there' is just the mechanics of transmission, and
the=20
mechanics of transmission can be very rather tedious!

I certainly accept that something like this could act as a trigger for some=
=20
poets to develop work from it but if the satisfaction is merely to see your=
=20
name on a poem you didn't write then I'm totally mystified.

Why I saw Obododimma reply it intensified my mystification because I was=20
delighted when someone had gone to the effort to find out I wasn't
included.=20
I couldn't get up the enthusiasm to check it out myself and somewhat
dreaded=20
being there. My name is who I am and I don't relinquish that lightly.

Anyway I might be wrong in this but could we be seeing a real shift (or eve=
n=20
rift) in attitudes between younger and older poets?  Many of you will have=
=20
been brought up with computer and be totally at ease with the computer age=
=20
with its impersonal and intrusive ways. Whereas poets of my generation (I'm

56) were brought up in a very very private word, without television=20
(although they were just about beginning to infiltrate the homes)=20
telephones (public ones would be streets away  if you knew anyone who had a=
=20
phone to ring! - everyone wrote letters) - and of course no fridges, cars=
=20
and all the other things we take for granted.  Apart from the radio which=
=20
was the main source of entertainment our known world was a small pocket of=
=20
our neighbourhood.  The pace of change has been phenomenal and much of it=
=20
for the better but it has been at the cost of our privacy.  In a way it's a

matter of what you don't know you don't miss.  I think a lot of poets
of my=20
generation know what real privacy was so we have something to compare it=20
to - and that comparison can be alarming.

Obviously I can't check out my 'age theory' in relation to the
'anthology'=20
but I wonder if this is a salient factor in all our attitudes towards this.=
=20
Just a thought.

Yes, I agree, the pleasure of seeing one's name attached to something one d=
idn't write--when it is in a harmless situation such as this, e.g., as some=
one else said, where it is not implying endorsement of something one oppose=
s--induces a sort of light and pleasurable shock: What if one had, if one c=
ould have, written that? What poet would one be then? It's a thought experi=

Troy,

You mean "believing in a free market" is not ideological? The, only not
believing in it is? That more or less sounds nonsensical to me. Have you
been following the congressional hearings at all? As it is turning out, the
credit swaps, which were completely unregulated and unobserved (your
"natural" state of the world) and with a size of over forty trillion at the
root of a lot of our present financial problems, were nothing but a casino
in the sky, the wizard of Oz turning out to be a mountebank.

As for your "anthropoligical" analysis, if we encounter slavery today, we
should tolerate it because it has existed before.

Ciao,

Murat

Subject: Revised: Reading at NYC Telephone Grill 11-13

Apologies for the crossed-out version you received earlier:


Prose Pros presents

CARMEN FIRAN and MARTHA KING

Thursday, November 13,  2008, 6:30 [fairly promptly] to 8:30 p.m.

at The Telephone Bar & Grill =96 149 Second Avenue btw 9th & 10th Streets

All trains to Union Square, 6 to Astor Place, F to Second Avenue

Carmen Firan

Carmen Firan has been living in New York City since 2000, forging artistic
links between New York's literary groups and the poets and writers of her
native Romania.  Widely celebrated in her home country, she writes fiction,
poetry, and essays on a remarkable number of subjects.  A special focus in
her fiction is the complexities of life for immigrants who are suddenly
confronted by irreversible changes when history, politics, and personal lif=
e
collide.  Her essays often deal, fittingly enough, with communication =96 t=
he
loss and possible return of the redemptive power of words.  See more at
www.carmenfiran.com

            Her latest book, Words & Flesh (with a preface by fellow
countryman Andrei Codrescu), is just out from Talisman House.

 "A crafter of wickedly satirical, sly and subtle short fictions," notes
Isaiah Sheffer, artistic director of Symphony Space and host of "Selected
Shorts" on NPR.

"Her works have deep layers of darkness intermingled with dazzling moments
of comic sadness," writes Kirby Olson.

"It took a survivor of Eastern
 European tyranny like Carmen Firan to reveal the true absurdity of the
American story. What seems normal and mundane to our jaded eyes becomes
surreal and even a little bit tragic through the wry lens of her writing." =
=96
Bruce Benderson

Martha King

Co-curator of the Prose Pros series, Martha King writes poetry, essays,
fiction, and memoir (and sometimes memoir/fiction).  Her most recent fictio=
n
collection, North & South, was greeted by Publisher's Weekly with these
comments:

"King attended the fabled Black Mountain College in the mid-1950s: her shor=
t
stories suggest the spare hardness and amused diffidence of Black Mountain
poet Robert Creeley; wrenching plot twists and the instability of narrative
itself=97King often interrupts to discard or evaluate the proceedings=97roo=
t her
best work in the postmodern contingency...."

She has been writing memoir in the same vein for the past few years. A shor=
t
section, titled "A map of Charlottesville, 1945" appears in the new
anthology Wreckage of Reason which has just been published by Spuyten
Duyvil.

The reading takes place in the comfortable backroom Lounge of the Telephone
Bar, famed for fine vegetarian and carnivore fare, cooked with an English
flair. Admission is free.

True. We (read, those who can, unlike me) should devise a way to anthologize

Hmm. I wonder what I'm about to walk into?

By "valid" I mean informed by desires and assumptions that I think
the majority of us should be able to accommodate in our little
individual Cartesian theaters, either because they spring from
desires we may share on some level or because they correspond to
recognizable positions that have a history. Though I'm prepared to
argue with many positions I'm willing to call valid.

If you're getting at what my position is on all this, well, I lean
toward thinking we should see this thing as a work of art rather than
an attempt to steal someone's identity. I think it's just as clear
here as it was in After Lorca that we're not seeing real toads in an
imaginary garden. That is to say, this is not a pipe, and you can
smoke it in a nonsmoking area.

"To feel an old house being restored actually and within the fresh

brings us all at once to one fine poet's home: now sit down and read
its timbres, words and boards, close to the fire."

Jules Boykoff and Kaia Sand

Time: 7:30 PM
Admission: $0-$5 sliding scale

@ DIVA
110 W Broadway
Eugene, OR


Kaia Sand is the author of the poetry collection interval (Edge Books 2004),
selected as a Small Press Traffic Book of the Year. She created a dusie
kollektiv (www.dusie.org) chapbook for her poem tiny arctic ice, which was
re-configured as a broadside by Bowerbox Press and as an artist book by Jim
Dine. She is creating multi-media investigations of political histories
lodged in Pacific Northwest of the United States, as well as a series of
poems collaged from dystopic documents. Sand co-edits the Tangent Press (
www.thetangentpress.org).


Jules Boykoff is co-author, with Kaia Sand, of Landscapes of Dissent:
Guerrilla Poetry & Public Space (Palm Press, 2008). He also wrote Beyond
Bullets: The Suppression of Dissent in the United States (AK Press, 2007),
The Suppression of Dissent: How the State and Mass Media Squelch USAmerican
Social Movements (Routledge, 2006) and the poetry collection Once Upon a
Neoliberal Rocket Badge (Edge Books, 2006), which was recently translated
into Italian by GAMMM. A collaboration with visual artist Jim Dine is
forthcoming (Steidl, 2008). In November 2006 he was an invited speaker at
the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Nairobi, Kenya, where he
presented research he carried out with his brother Maxwell Boykoff (Oxford
University) on U.S. media coverage of global warming. Boykoff teaches
political science and writing at Pacific University and lives in Portland,
Oregon, USA where he co-curates the Tangent Reading Series with Rodney
Koeneke and Kaia Sand.


DIVA offers a monthly avant-garde poetry reading series that brings to
Eugene emerging poets from Oregon as well as innovative writers touring the
Northwest.

As she is a Canadian, Naomi Klein cannot run for US president. A
stupid person from Alaska can, though.

Meritage Press Announcement

Meritage Press (MP) is pleased to announce two new releases from its
"Tiny Book" series:

               Randion screpts
               by Jukka-Pekka Kervinen
and
               (b)its
               by Joel Chase

MP's "Tiny Books" are structured to align poetry with fair trade and
economic development issues. They utilize small books (1 3/4" x 1
3/4") made in Nepal by artisans paid fair wages, as sourced by
Baksheesh, a fair trade retailer. Photos of a sample "Tiny Book" are
available at http://www.flickr.com/photos/lolabola/1618955048/in/photostrea=
m
as well as through Crg Hill's Poetry Scorecard at
http://scorecard.typepad.com/crag_hills_poetry_score/haynaku/index.html
. Another illustrated review by Geof Huth is available at
http://dbqp.blogspot.com/2008/02/one-2-free-for-5ve-sex-sever-ache.html
.

Jukka-Pekka Kervinen is a Finnish writer, composer and visual artist.
He has published 16 books so far, as well as numerous e-books and
collaborative  books; his texts also have appeared in several
magazines, electronic publications and anthologies. His works are
focused to modern technology, heavy use of computer for generation,
manipulation and re-synthesizing of textual, visual and aural
materials. Jukka lives in the small village Puhos, in Kitee, Finland.

Joel Chace has published poetry and prose poetry in more than a dozen
print and electronic collections.  New from BlazeVox Books is CLEANING
THE MIRROR:  NEW AND SELECTED POEMS, and from Paper Kite Press, MATTER
NO MATTER, another full-length collection.  For many years, Chace was
Poetry Editor for the experimental electronic magazine 5_Trope.

All profits from book sales will be donated to Heifer International,
an organization devoted to reducing world hunger by promoting
sustainable sources of food and income. This project reflects MP's
belief that "Poetry feeds the world" in non-metaphorical ways. The
Tiny Books create demand for fair trade workers' products while also
sourcing donations for easing poverty in poorer areas of the world.
Note, too, that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has awarded a $2.5
Million Matching Grant to Heifer, which means every dollar donated
(e.g. through "Tiny Books") can be doubled!

Each "Tiny Book" costs $10 plus $1.00 shipping/handling in the U.S.
(email us first for non-U.S. orders). To purchase the "Tiny Books" and
donate to Heifer International, send a check for $11.00 per book, made
out to "Meritage Press" to

Eileen Tabios
Meritage Press
256 North Fork Crystal Springs Rd.
St. Helena, CA 94574

Please specify which of the "Tiny Books" you are ordering, since the
entire "Tiny Books" Series continue to be available:

              from "The Tradition
               by Juliana Spahr
and
               some hay
               by Lars Palm
and
               Speak which
               Hay(na)ku poems
               by Jill Jones
and
               "=85And Then The Wind Did Blow..."
               Jainak=FA Poems
               by Ernesto Priego
and
               Steps: A Notebook
               by Tom Beckett
and
               all alone again
               by Dan Waber

With "Tiny Books," MP also offers a new DIY, or Do-It-Yourself Model
of publishing. You've heard of POD or print-on-demand? Well, these
books' print runs will be based on HOD or Handwritten-on-Demand. MP's
publisher, Eileen Tabios, will handwrite all texts into the Tiny
Books' pages and books will be released to meet demand for as long as
MP is able to source tiny books -- or until the publisher gets
arthritis or debilitative carpal tunnel syndrome.

FUNDAISING UPDATE:
In addition to providing livestock, Heifer International also provides
trees. In, 2007, Meritage Press' Tiny Books program sold enough Tiny
Books to finance the donation equivalent of at least seven sets of
tree-gifts. Here's what Heifer has to say about trees:

One of Heifer International's most important commitments is to care
for the earth. We believe development must be sustainable =97 that
projects should be long-term investments in the future of people and
the planet.That's why in addition to livestock, Heifer often provides
families with trees. On a steep Tanzanian hillside, Heifer
International helped a family learn to plant trees and elephant grass
to keep the soil in place. Today, they have flourishing rows of
leucaena trees and corn.Through training, families learn how to keep
their small plots of land healthy and renew the soil for future
generations by planting trees, using natural fertilizer, and limiting
grazing.By helping families raise their animals in harmony with
nature, you can fight poverty and hunger while ensuring a healthy,
productive future for us all.

Then of course there are the chickens, goats, water buffalos, pigs,
ducks, honeybees, llamas....all of which can help ease hunger around
the world. Meritage Press thanks you in advance for your support and
hopes you enjoy Tiny Books -- small enough to become jewelry, but with
poems big enough to resonate worldwide.

Dear Doctor Camplin=2C

@Ryan,
I have this strange feeling a computer program would make just as many
compositional "mistakes" as a human poet. Perhaps we could devise
some sort
of poetical Turing test to tell the difference. Which raises the issue of
what to call it--a Homer Test? A RACTER test? A W(h)it-mus test--like
measuring acid, but cleverer, with a beard?

There's info about that at
http://poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2008/10/anthology_spoiler.html

If I understand correctly, there is 0% correlation between the poets and
'their poems'. Although several poets wrote in to the Poetics list =
noting
some perceived correlation between their own work and what appeared =
under
their name in the 'anthology'. I think they were mistaken, actually.

That's an informed response, Philip. About pomo art. But the poets on =
the
Poetics list are quite varied in their sophistication concerning such
things. From absolutely clueless to very knowlegeable indeed. Because
contemporary poetry scenes and approaches run the gamut from =
cluelessness
about technology and contemporary art (apart from print poetry) to local
dominance to ... to ... international media art synthesis of arts, =
media,
and technology.

Also, Jim Carpenter's project deals with the poemy poem. Not visual =
poetry
or sound poetry or obviously algorithmic poetry and so on. So Jim's =
project
deals with a type of poetry that most poets and readers of poetry =
understand
to be poetry.

I expect that, whether one is talking about poetry or visual art or =
music
yadayada, what will get a wide audience will not so much be how the =
project
deals with the sort of issues we raise concerning generative =
art--fascinating and
genuinely important as those issues are, I believe--but issues that are =
more
widely understood. And, of course, the appeal to vanity in this project =
is
also, well, amusing.

99.9999% of the folks out there will only get into the issues of =
generative
art when they are led there via a string of considerations that don't =
start
there.

This is precisely like reading your horoscope and saying "Oh my gosh,
this is totally relevant to my life right at this instant!" Every poem
was randomly assigned.

I do, however, acknowledge the existence of the possibility that I may
have altered this or that poem or assigned poems based on word matches
from book titles harvested from SPD. And I further acknowledge that I
can provide no objective proof of my actions in this regard. Even
further -- now that these ideas have been generated by list
discussion, I may well use such ethically questionable practices in
future projects. I'll have to sleep on it. In any case, they were all
randomly assigned. In fact, this is the first time I've seen your
name.

Jim, just a quibble: I would say that any perceived similarities
between our work and our "work" were likely to be coincidences rather
than mistakes (but hey, who knows, I could make those I saw portals of
discovery).

Full disclosure: I wholeheartedly believe in the pursuit of
significant coincidences and the search for synchronicity.

Well, I suppose it could be done. Ask poets to send in their own
mistakes or to trawl the web for mistakes they see other as having
made; this would probably best be done as a blog to allow for links to
mistakes (to avoid fussy legal issues) and to allow readers to point
out mistaken identifications of mistakes (and this could be extended
ad infinitum).

Or maybe a wiki would be better? Only one that foregrounds the
palimpsest of edits rather than the finished thing.

I adore mistakes.

I propose a Fake Generation game. Anyone born between Jan. 1, 1935,

Drunken Boat Design  Contest=20
=20
Help Drunken Boat < www.drunkenboat.com >, an international online =
journal of the arts, celebrate its 10th anniversary. Part of our =
conceptual origin has been in exhibiting works of art that use the =
medium of the Web as constitutive of meaning; with this in mind we are =
soliciting proposals for the design of a special 10th issue dedicated to =
arts and literature online. The winning designer receives a $2500 =
honorarium in return for designing the home page of a publication that =
attracts nearly half a million unique visitors per year.

=20
PERMISSION=20
Contestants grant Drunken Boat permission to display a designer=92s =
name, company name, client name and/or relevant design work at =
www.drunkenboat.com.=20
=20
COPYRIGHT NOTICE=20
Drunken Boat assumes all submitted artwork is the property of the =
designer or design firm submitting the work. Drunken Boat will not be =
liable for any copyright infringement on the part of the contestant. All =
rights to the work will revert to the designer upon publication.=20
=20
ETHICAL GUIDELINES=20
Drunken Boat reserves the right to revoke the award from any individual =
or company, whose artwork does not fall within the ethical guidelines =
set forth by the magazine, whether before, during or after the judging =
is complete. Fees are non-refundable once the entry has been submitted =
for any reason.=20
=20
TERMS OF DELIVERY=20
The winner will receive a $2500 honorarium, payable upon launch date of =
the 10th anniversary issue. The winner will be responsible for all =
aspects of the home page design, including its interface with all other =
sections of the issue (particularly the 10 mini-sites). The winner must =
also be willing to work with other individuals, as needed, to enable =
completion of the issue in time for a Winter 2008/2009 launch.=20
=20
DEADLINE
December 01 2008=20
=20
RULES=20
The Drunken Boat Design Contest is open to designers from any =
discipline, from anywhere in the world, particularly individuals attuned =
to the potential dynamicity of designing work online. We at Drunken Boat =
are open to any number of aesthetic models that might encompass this =
issue=92s contents. Best of all would be an interactive / dynamic =
component that actively invites reader participation. The only =
parameters of the contest are that all of the home page designs must be =
structured to encompass a group of 10 mini-sites designed by Drunken =
Boat Web Editor / Site Designer Shawn M. McKinney. A sample of the =
visual design of the 10 mini-sites may be found here: =
www.drunkenboat.com/db10/designcontest.=20
=20
All entries will be considered potential home pages; some finalists may =
ultimately provide alternate home page designs.=20
=20
NOTES=20
We don=92t expect you to submit an entire Web site. We do expect you to =
provide us with a clear sense of the graphic =93look and feel=94 of a =
home page, as well as a proposed system of navigation, for Drunken Boat, =
Issue No. 10. In addition, all proposed design elements must be =
aesthetically compatible with the 10 mini-sites mentioned previously. =
Although your email confirmation and digital artwork will be sufficient =
for our judges to assess your entry properly, contestants may physically =
mail design samples to allow for a more in-depth evaluation process. In =
any event, no materials will be returned (unless prior arrangement has =
been reached). Please submit disposable materials wherever possible.=20
=20
We urge you to explore the archives of www.drunkenboat.com. Take a look =
at some of the creative work we have published in the past, while you =
consider the design sensibility that has shaped previous issues. Also, =
you might want to read the =93designer=92s note=94 (essay) found in the =
Oulipo section of Drunken Boat, Issue No. 8. Locate it as follows: =
www.drunkenboat.com/db8 > oulipo > shawn m. mckinney > =93Oulipo Redux: =
Extensible, Exegetic, Ex Post Facto.=94
=20
A spirit of collaboration is essential to the success of this contest =
and this special issue of Drunken Boat. The winning designer will be =
expected to work closely with a staff of designers and editors to =
complete the design of Issue No. 10. Mavericks need not apply.=20
=20
All entries must be received by midnight. No late entries will be =
considered.=20

Hmm, I was surprised to find my name there. A friend told me I was
there, so I checked. My 'fame' gland was momentarily excited - but
then I read the poem. My 'shame' gland leapt into life. Awful; no
redeeming features at all. I was disappointed in them portraying me
like that. What if somebody should even half-way believe it was mine?
Awful. An absolutely strange mix of 'poets' - just names drawn out of
a cyber hat. I feel used - I laughed at the project until I found
myself in it - so much work for what? It isn't even a good sham in as
much as I doubt there is a public readership out there who would
believe in it. Too much exposure has happened for that to be achieved.

... but a fun game for those who created it. That is all. It would be
doubly cool if the perpetrators now offered us a 'true' anthology with
OUR poems in it as Issue 2.

I found, reading "my" poems that I had a tendency to read for signs
of my signature on the poem. I had entertained the possibility that
there were word choices in the machinery linked to specific poems
culled from online journals, but then, several of my friends who are
not poets were also included so that seemed unlikely. in any case,
the exercise of reading in to these poems i think is part of the

The financial crisis is not even remotely as you portray it.  There is nothing in the area of finance not regulated, and anyone who told you otherwise was lying to you.

Believing in evolution is not ideological; not believing in it is.
Believing in a heliocentric solar system is not ideological; not believing in it is.
Believing in the spontaneous order known as the free market system of economics is not ideological; not believing in it is.

My anthropological approach does not excuse slavery any more than it excuses poverty. What it allows us to do is understand the origins of poverty, that it is a natural state, that wealth is new and something that we should be trying to get more people into. But wealth is not the natural state of things, and the wealth of others does not cause poverty in others. Historically, the wealth of others, especially in free market situations, allows for the wealth of others. THe world is not a zero-sum game.

Troy,

You mean "believing in a free market" is not ideological? The, only not
believing in it is? That more or less sounds nonsensical to me. Have you
been following the congressional hearings at all? As it is turning out, the
credit swaps, which were completely unregulated and unobserved (your
"natural" state of the world) and with a size of over forty trillion at the
root of a lot of our present financial problems, were nothing but a casino
in the sky, the wizard of Oz turning out to be a mountebank.

As for your "anthropoligical" analysis, if we encounter slavery today, we
should tolerate it because it has existed before.

Ciao,

Murat

Hello Jason (oh and thank you all for the other replies, but I just want to
take up a point with Jason - sorry Jason - you've got the short straw this
time! ).

Aren't you being slightly contradictory here?  You say your name has little
to do with you.  Fair enough, the word pain is not pain itself but it's the
word we use to convey a state of mind or body.  Your name may be a series of
sounds and letters but that is what language is - so you could be saying
that language has little to do with you.  Try it out for a day.  No talking,
no word thought, no name - eer no don't try it out because except for
exceptional cases it's usually called death.  It's virtually impossible not
to inhabit language ipso facto it has everything to do with us.

And I think, with all respect,  that's why you end up seeming to contradict
yourself by saying that you would object if you're name was attached to
something you didn't like or was appropriated for foul means.  But doesn't
this demonstrate that we can't pick and choose - and that is the danger of
being complacent about our names being stolen.  Lots of you had a giggle at
the anthology and thought it hilarious  but what if the next list with all
your names isn't so amusing -  is something very dark.   It could be. This
could just be the grooming to soften you up. Ah they love it - now let's
give them more.  The bottom line is it's identity theft and you don't care.

On an even more serious note I believe many on this list are dead and I find
this rather sick. It includes my dear friend Bob Cobbing.  So we're not
talking long dead but recently dead with a widow and children. Poets with
friends and family in living memory are fair game?   Maybe I should check
out what they have attributed to Bob - but I just can't do it because I know
it's not him.  The very callousness of these inclusion of the dead show that
the people who did it don't give a fig about you, me or anyone - they are
using us all - it's a practical joke - hilarious?  I don't think so.  If I
was a widow and saw my darling husband in this list I wouldn't be amused.

Bob Cobbing used every artificial device available (he was the first person
I knew who got a computer type thingy - we tried typing in poems into it and
it keep saying  'fatal error' - we laughed our socks off at this assessment
of our writing but it got a bit frustrating after a while). He/I loved and
thrived off found writings, cut and paste, stick it in the tumble dryer,
leave it in the sun, bung it in a shredder and see what comes out  -
brilliant - we have to try and bump ourselves out of our own mindsets (or
into them before the word and world got to them).  Computer generate your
own poems but don't  give up your identity when it pleases you otherwise you
have to accept that it will be taken from you when it doesn't. Yes?

Hi Geraldine,
Here's my point:
Am I JF Quackenbush who writes poetry and publishes it in various
small journals? Am I JF Quackenbush the widely published
microbiologist? Am I Jason Quackenbush the minor league midwestern
professional wrestler? If you google my name, you'll find all of
those people. One of them is the result a collection of actions that
I have taken. The others have nothing to do with me. Ultimately, it's
just the internet and who cares. I can't pick and choose how my name
gets used detached from my actions and the "JF Quackenbush" who is
part of this anthology is peripherally related to me, but it's in
that grey area where it doesn't get my back up. Now were someone to
start a smear campaign against me and accuse me of taking actions
that I find reprehensible, like murder or publishing bad poetry, that
I might take exception to but because they're attributing actions to
me that aren't mine. I don't think any reasonable person with a
reasonable familiarity with contemporary poetry ought to be able to
tell that the poems in this thing are computer generated, and the
inclusion of "new" poetry by Bill Shakespeare, ee cummings, and Edna
St. Vincent Millay should clue in everybody else who isn't paying
close enough attention that these poems aren't real acts by the
persons whose names are listed. That to me as a fundamental difference.

As a side note, this idea of name as personal property is not
necessarily something that existed once upon a time and has vanished
in the information age. Prior to the last couple hundred years and
the expansion of copyright protections and libel/slander laws, there
have been all kinds of uses of false attribution in order to make
some sort of political or artistic point. Heck, some of the greatest
selling poetry of all time, the stuff in the Bible, is largely
pseudoepigraphal. Pseudoepigapha of unknown quantities like myself is
maybe a little bit strange, but frankly I think that that sort of
democratization is precisely what makes this particular project so
interesting. It's precisely the sort of question that a piece of
conceptual work like this should be acting. I think of all the poets
I only know and interact with through the internet, and all that a
lot of you are are neames to me. Who are Jessica Smith, Anny
Ballardini, Geof Gatza, or Jim Andrews? They're all there in the
Anthology, and I "know" them all, and as writers I know and respect
their work. But really that knowing is just text on a screen, well
and pictures and sounds sometimes, but really, it's not direct human
contact despite the fact that if I was asked I might say, yeah I know
so and so. I think it's possible that I've built up an unsupportable
and overly strong idea of identity in the face of what I think is a
reasonable rejection of Barthes claim that there is no author just
text. And I don't think I'm alone in that. But in a world where all
so many of us know of one another, and I think this is wider than
just poetry but extends to everyone who is at all involved in human
interaction through the internet which these days at least it's
largely impossible not to be, is through a form of authorship, I
think a project like this has value in the way that it highlights the
vagaries of what actually is going on in that authorship which
vagaries led to the authors epitaph in the first place.

Who knows though. I could be wrong. Maybe I really am a professional
wrestler and shouldn't be talking about this literary theory stuff at
all.

My friend Eric Rosenfield is in it and is not a poet, so I bet he
wouldn't mind if you swipe the minimalist ditty of his.

Mine had similies in it. (Yes, that is a proper spelling).
That proves that the computer is a bad poet.

Hello everyone,

The Blackbox summer gallery is now online.? Per usual, we have a mix of semi-regulars and new contributors.? One more contributor will be added shortly, but I wanted to keep my promise to go live in a couple of days.? So here it is.
Go to WilliamJamesAustin.com and follow the Blackbox link.? Then take a long stroll (scroll) through the galleries until to arrive at the latest.? Enjoy!

Best, William James Austin (Bill)

Yes, Geraldine, dead poets are there. And, could we be wrong to think that dead poets don't write (bite/byte?)? Perhaps, in the thinking of the anthologists, dead poets, disembodied as they are, are the number one netizens. Which was why I had to write a comment on behalf of my friend, e.e. cummings, who is also listed.

Hello Jason (oh and thank you all for the other replies, but I just want to
take up a point with Jason - sorry Jason - you've got the short straw this
time! ).

Aren't you being slightly contradictory here?  You say your name has little
to do with you.  Fair enough, the word pain is not pain itself but it's the
word we use to convey a state of mind or body.  Your name may be a series of
sounds and letters but that is what language is - so you could be saying
that language has little to do with you.  Try it out for a day.  No talking,
no word thought, no name - eer no don't try it out because except for
exceptional cases it's usually called death.  It's virtually impossible not
to inhabit language ipso facto it has everything to do with us.

And I think, with all respect,  that's why you end up seeming to contradict
yourself by saying that you would object if you're name was attached to
something you didn't like or was appropriated for foul means.  But doesn't
this demonstrate that we can't pick and choose - and that is the danger of
being complacent about our names being stolen.  Lots of you had a giggle at
the anthology and thought it hilarious  but what if the next list with all
your names isn't so amusing -  is something very dark.   It could be. This
could just be the grooming to soften you up. Ah they love it - now let's
give them more.  The bottom line is it's identity theft and you don't care.

On an even more serious note I believe many on this list are dead and I find
this rather sick. It includes my dear friend Bob Cobbing.  So we're not
talking long dead but recently dead with a widow and children. Poets with
friends and family in living memory are fair game?   Maybe I should check
out what they have attributed to Bob - but I just can't do it because I know
it's not him.  The very callousness of these inclusion of the dead show that
the people who did it don't give a fig about you, me or anyone - they are
using us all - it's a practical joke - hilarious?  I don't think so.  If I
was a widow and saw my darling husband in this list I wouldn't be amused.

Bob Cobbing used every artificial device available (he was the first person
I knew who got a computer type thingy - we tried typing in poems into it and
it keep saying  'fatal error' - we laughed our socks off at this assessment
of our writing but it got a bit frustrating after a while). He/I loved and
thrived off found writings, cut and paste, stick it in the tumble dryer,
leave it in the sun, bung it in a shredder and see what comes out  -
brilliant - we have to try and bump ourselves out of our own mindsets (or
into them before the word and world got to them).  Computer generate your
own poems but don't  give up your identity when it pleases you otherwise you
have to accept that it will be taken from you when it doesn't. Yes?

 No, Hal. Let's use a computer program to generate a "fake" generation! That, I think, would be fair.

It would be a way to interrogate our mistakes. We could sit back and
"understand" our own flaws.

It would be like having a town hall debate, but with thoughtful questions.

 1) I view the writer of the algorythm, program, whatever, as well as the
writers of any source material (but there doesn't seem to be any? ???) to be
the writers of this work (except if placing it in .pdf format involved
indents, for example); when I decided this, I started having very much more
of a problem with the use of names of people who did not write the program
with the results.  It disguises the essential nature of the writtenness of
computer programs, deliberately, and seems to align with posthuman theory I
disagree with.  It disguises the fact that the writing is "results" or
"output" -- of, I may point out, a "test."  Is the test of the system the
real thing?  Is the system completed?  I don't know. What was the test bed?
Can you feed this back in and get a different anthology?

It also raises another question, which is,

2) has the writer read the work?  He has called the results poetry, but has
he read it?  How does he know?

His reading would make it more "his" -- his response:  to publish it not
under his name.  Making Anne's reading of the poem ascribed to her, finding
in it poetry, a second reading, not a first one.  The first "reading"
unfortunately cannot be the machines, because um, they can't read.  They can
scan.  (How was the text fed in?  Or not -- just trawled?  Any intervention
of any type?  Programmed intervention? Human intervention not via
programming? Any humans read anything?  Tweak the code during output?)

3) Also, my piece is really terrible.  It is just awful.  At first, I was
objecting to the program, since it was producing dreck.  Then I thought,
maybe something about poetry and aesthetics.  Now I think:  what a miserably
aimed, sloppily controlled, misanthropic project.  What was it devised to
do? Why is that design or intention important, inherent, significant, or
not?  (for example, it is a design through and through?)  Why did the writer
insert or collate harvested names -- many of whom have very specific ideas
and various ideas -- into a text that was "one substance"?  That they were
(mostly) poets from lists were postings about readings, publications, etc.,
has replaced discussion?

4) post-identity  = posthuman?

Dear Sharon,
Thanks so much for your reply.  I honestly don't understand their
satisfaction with being given a poem - it's not the same as a found poem you
find yourself - its all done and dusted with no input from them whatsoever
except the frisson of seeing their name - and then they have the 'hilarity'
to argue that their name doesn't matter.  Are  they are reading everyone
else's fake poems! They just don't seem to see the contradiction - nor the
paucity of it. Hilarious!  Bloody hell.  I despair. I think the lesser known
are most thrilled so maybe we shouldn't be to harsh on them but catch my
next letter to Jason where I outline some more of my other concerns.

London 86!  Was that at Young Vic Theatre on The Cut?  I think I also read
at  the Festival Hall.  20 years ago!  Oh no.  22 years ago.  Not water but
torrents under the bridge.  How lovely that you were there.

Take care,

And best wishes,

Geraldine

Some comments in defense of the "perpetrators" being pilloried as
wicked, wicked people:

Something very dark? Are you really comparing an obvious
misattribution done as part of an artwork to, what, blacklists?
Terrorist watch lists? What does "something very dark" mean? If it's
theft, I'd just like to say I still have my name, and no one that
really matters would be confused longer than a heartbeat over whether
that's me in that anthology or not.

It's easy to claim this is identity theft. But it's not. Not in any
sense that would hold up in court. Maybe you could win a civil suit
claiming your name has declined in value and that's what your income
is based on. But it is not identify theft. It is obviously, as many
have observed, not real. Again: This is not a pipe.

In my case, the answer to the "what if the next list [with your name]
isn't so amusing" would be: I'd object then because it would then be
appropriate, by my light, to object. That is, we can pick and choose.
Granted, I can't control whether or not I'm on some terrorist watch
list, but I can at least object to it. If I find my name supporting,
say John McCain, as a recent pop group did, I can make my ire known
and put mud in McCain's eye.

The "sickness" here depends on your perception of it as a wicked
thing to do. I suspect anyone I left behind would think I'd
appreciate the gesture. Again, I'm thinking of Spicer and Lorca.
Spicer assumed some affinity.

Given Cobbing's interests, does such a work and such a borrowing of
his name amount to an homage? At least a little?

Up to now, the discussion of the anthology has focused on the quality of the
poems and different people's reactions to having one's name attached to a
piece they did not "write, " the delight and anger towards the process. I
sympathize very much with those questioning the idea of "authorship," in
Ron's words, "a brand" attached to that name. For years I firmly believed
what Kent Johnson did with The Doubled Flowering and The Miseries of Poetry
were profound activities. My own Eda Anthology of Turkish poetry resonates
with a similar ambiguity about the nature authorship -though the Turkish
poets in it are "real" persons. I also understand Barry's comment in a
parallel thread about how a poem to which his name is attached by others can
spur him to write other poems, again pointing to the porousness of poetic
identity, how that can be a dynamic force.

*But* this collection is also an anthology and in an anthology the issue of
selection, and indirectly authority, are of primary importance. I see
absolutely no analysis of, interest in this aspect of the project. When, in
a previous post, I asked what was the algorithm which made the selection, in
a way determining what name is visible and in that sense "real, I was
pointing to that question. In a moment in our history when a completely
obscure and unanalyzed series of programs -the creators of all those credit
swaps, for example- will cause untold misery to potentially *b*illions of
people, it is important to ask this question. Are we not similarly enamored
of this mysterious "algorithmic edtor"? I believe there is a profound
connection between our present economic/financial crisis -one can call the
financial side the signifyer and the economic/main street side the
signified- and this "fake anthology." For poets I believe this can be a
great opportunity for poetry to emerge out of a coccoon -where poetry's
place basically is in The United states, despite all its protestaions- and
truly engage and merge with wider social issues.

Ciao,

George, I had no idea Naomi Klein is Canadian.  Well, the whole world is
lucky to have her as no one has a keener sense of how we got ourselves into
the mess we're in.  Her way of placing the crisis into large but accessible
frames of economic theory is invaluable!

Jim, just a quibble: I would say that any perceived similarities
between our work and our "work" were likely to be coincidences rather
than mistakes (but hey, who knows, I could make those I saw portals of
discovery).

Full disclosure: I wholeheartedly believe in the pursuit of
significant coincidences and the search for synchronicity.

K.S. Ernst's Drop Caps is an alphabet book, a Pandora's box of verbo-=20
visual treasures, a crate of sculptures, a litany of of the textual =20
imagination, and a pure delight for the eye. Combining the eye of a =20
painter, the ear of a poet, and the hand of a typographer, Ernst =20
examines the power of text through color, cancellation, eradication, =20
shape, torquing, humor, pathos, and a dry sense of humor and =20
seriousness that surprise on every page. Beginning as an alphabet book =20=

that swerves from frame to frame with visual legerdemain and grace, =20
the book ends with a flickering set of even greater experimentations, =20=

each of which on every page are haunted by individual capital letters =20=

of the alphabet, often askew, the dropped capitals that give the book =20=

its name.

	=97Geof Huth

It's always a pleasure to write about K.S. Ernst, allowing me an =20
opportunity to try to spread the good news of new publications and to =20=

further contextualize her in the frames of her own opus and of the =20
arts of our time. Writing about publications in editions is =20
particularly important in her case, since most of her oeuvre is one-of-=20=

a-kind works of art. Still, I've had the opportunity to write about =20
her in her Web Survey  (http://www.thing.net/~grist/ld/ernst/=20
ernst.htm) and in an extended essay on her and her closest =20
collaborators, Marilyn R. Rosenberg and David Cole in Correspondence =20
Art Solos and Choruses (http://www.bigbridge.org/young/so-ch.htm). =20
Drop Caps, gives the reader a better sense of her abilities to work in =20=

multiple dimensions than those editions which have come before. =20
Dimensions in this case include reproductions of bas relief sculpture =20=

that come as close as an affordable book can manage to demonstrating =20
her work with three dimensional pages. The text itself may be the =20
fullest published to date. Here, phantom narratives nest conundrums in =20=

their coyly side-stepping and evasive sentences, in turn nested inside =20=

questions with multiple answers=97and answers to multiple questions. =20
These stories in turn find themselves graphically placed inside =20
layered explorations of the shapes and potential functions of letters =20=

in a delightful play of dancing wit and in-depth exploration of signs =20=

we take for granted. How much can the intrusion of the upper serif and =20=

middle bar of the letter G fill in the spectral tones and messages of =20=

ungrateful ghosts whispering above obscured candles? It may be =20
surprising how much particularly for those too familiar with now =20
predictable genres ranging from popular fiction to the latest in =20
deconstructionist theory to the rigidity of the Concrete Poetry of =20
half a century ago. In previous comments, I've called Ernst the Mozart =20=

of current visual poetry. If my comments here suggest a forbiddingly =20
difficult work, that's just a reflection of my problems in summing up =20=

the book in a brief space. As in the early through middle Mozart, =20
Ernst has an uncanny ability to make the most complex ideas clear, =20
free of pretension or obfuscation, and not only easy but fun to follow.

	=97Karl Young

For inventive elegance, few visual poets in any language now can equal =20=

K. S. Ernst.
=09
	=97Richard Kostelanetz

The visio-textual art of K.S. Ernst lifts poetry to its rightful three-=20=

dimensional habitat where it comes alive: viewable, palpable, =20
performative. This essential, generative synthesis of mind and heart =20
creates experience, immediately memorable. Raw truth spawns multiple =20
probable realities. Works by K.S. Ernst should be seen widely, studied =20=

intently, and savored by discerning viewers for whom art equals =20
infinity. The text of Drop Caps, generous, insightful, and framed by =20
its source letters, encompasses mind in matter. Anchored by coherence =20=

of the alphabet, this book characterizes what is best in contemporary =20=

visio-textual art. Drop Caps is a must-have for every library seeking =20=

to encompass what is most dynamic in 21st Century art.

	=97Sheila E. Murphy

Just when I thought everything anybody could do with the alphabet had =20=

now been done, K.S. Ernst finds ten million new ways to use it (while =20=

doing a lot of other good stuff, too=97some of it Very Funny)!

	=97Bob Grumman

Much more than just an ABC, this alphabet-structured book explores the =20=

possible complete randomness (therefore a kind of order) of our ways =20
of arranging language, and thus of consciousness itself.  Each letter =20=

is approached from numerous perspectives and is shown to be at the =20
center of a swarm of text, structure, form, color, dimensionality, =20
emotion, idea, and many other manifestations of what is.  An =20
impressive and beautiful work.

geraldine, sharon, et al.:

i like j.p. craig's initial taxonomy of responses to the anthology project,
to which i add my own take here: i see the gesture of
distributing/attributing the computer's labor over/to a large community of
poets as a reminder of broad custody (as opposed to ownership) we all have
for the language.

my satisfaction or delight comes from seeing words combined in new ways, in
large part without regard for whose name is or isn't on it. those who are
impressed by the high quality of many of the anthology's poems will be
further surprised to begin working through, as i have, the fruits of jim
carpenter's electronic text composition project

http://www.slought.org/content/11227/

and find the quality appears pretty consistently high. i take this less as
an effront to than a furtherance of poetry's humanist underpinings (the
input and the algorithm and the hardware are after all human, it's only the
processing speed that is super-human) and a clarion call to flesh-and-blood
poets to step up our game...

tom orange

p.s. re "generational" -- my nephews (ages 7 and 11) already express no
preference for reading printed pages over computer screens as do many of us
older folk...

PBS has an online=20

Apparently the right wing=20

The poll will be reported on PBS and picked up by mainstream=20

can influence undecided voters in swing states.

Please do=20
two things -- takes 20 seconds.

1) Click on link and vote=20
yourself.

Here's the=20

2) Then send=20
this to every single Obama-Biden voter you know=2C and urge

The last thing we need is PBS saying their viewers think=20

I would just call it-The Unbearable Lightness of Issue #1. For days I've
been coming back to posts about the faux anthology and trying to write a
response. Geraldine Monk and Sharon Mesmer added perceptive things to think
about and some of it connects to the aspect that I was focused on yesterday
that had to do with the loss of something, maybe privacy, but that word does
not get the whole thing I've been feeling today, a day later. In a way, I
feel like this is the kind of note I should write drunk.  As I've said
publicly and privately many times, it was in the wake of 9/11 that I began
to truly value and appreciate the opportunities for ongoing and immediate
community with poets made available on this list.  After the satisfactions
and challenges of that experience, I began blogging, and have found great
value in that as well. But, as with every expansion, there is a price to be
paid. While I also very much miss the privacy Geraldine Monk is writing
about so vividly and sensitively, I very well realize it is rapidly becoming
a relic of the past like a tune you can tap your foot to but not quite
remember the words of or the old mood completely. But there is something
about that huge sudden ironic parody that calls for instant recognition of
the non serious nature of the intervention. This is the "unbearable
lightness of blogging" as I once termed it, par excellence. A poetry circus
wagon blows in, warm wind and ill wind, spins a few sails, shakes a few
tails and blows out: a party with  real laughs, a few growls and roars and
some intense conversations where you recognize a lot of people, don't know
some, you figure "everybody" was there, but of course that's not literally
possible. The feeling is, maybe they were out of town or something, or just
couldn't make it, but not that they were deliberately excluded. I know I
would have felt left out had I not been mentioned. But since I was I do get
into that lightness, but it is a blue lightness while still feeling
nostalgic for the more private days of the whole long stretched out thing-
getting an invitation, figuring what to send, waiting to hear, then getting
accepted.  But in this party atmosphere it's just all so quickly thrown
together, no time, so quickly check how my poem was dressed and acted, ok,
did I see some friends, yeah, their poems are ok. So then it's over, and
there's the hangover of- what did I do, did I actually write that thing, no
way, nobody did,  a computer wrote it. After all, it is the era of the
machine. So what did I say- I'm not sure how I feel now. Then the party
really starts and everyone talks about it for days. No, not like a reading
or an opening, more like a bash, or an old fashioned happening where people
were only half aware of what was going on. Maybe all the evidence has
already been put away and the place has been swept up. Maybe a few people
actually kept their party favors and others left and forgot them. But now
there's a memory, that Godot thing that gets talked about. People have been
saying that we are in a time warp in that in New York now, that we are in a
repeat of the Weimar era. Maybe this Godot thing is our cabaret- rude,
crude, risque, funny, a little dark, with music by Kurt Weill and a set by
Kirchner, Grosz or Hannah Hoch. I had even written in the comment section of
Issue 1, "There has been talk of a poetry bailout. Is this it?" It looks
like the powers that be are plotting to send the whole batch of us poets and
day workers out onto the streets as in *The Threepenny Opera* while
"citibank" robs everybody blind. And then we'll listen to the barrel organ
sound, in the city while the sun sinks low.

From what I've seen, I would argue that many of the barbarisms committed in
the name of socialism were committed because people forgot that no
collective good exists without the good of the individuals who make up that
collective.

JF/Jason/whoever you are-- So does that mean my name is mine if the only
other one I can find with first and last identical is dead (and the only
thing on her is an obit)? Or does that mean that with my middle name
included, it's definitely my name since I'm the only one who comes up under
it? Hurrah for given and family names with mismatched ethnic identities
then! (I prefer, too, to be referred to in publication with my middle name
included not for this reason of uniqueness but for the related goal of
ensuring that my initials are different from those of my brother, my late
father, and his late father.)

Really, my primary thought about the anthology was that it was boring. A big
mass of dull, dull poetry sometimes mediocre and sometimes dreck; I'd really
rather have godawful poetry that mediocre work associated with the name that
perhaps by the wonders of idiosyncrasy I could be said to possess. The
outrage responses, however, are hilarious!

The trouble with comparing a poet with a radio is that radios
      don't develop scar-tissue. The tubes burn out, or with a
      transistor, which most souls are, the battery or diagram
      burns out replaceable or not replaceable, but not like that
      punchdrunk fighter in a bar. The poet

Takes too many messages. The right to the ear that floored him
      in New Jersey. The right to say that he stood six rounds with
      a champion.
  ...

The poet is a radio. The poet is a liar. The poet is a
      counterpunching radio.

And those messages (God would not damn them) do not even
      know they are champions.

Oops. Pardon me. This was meant to be private.  So apologies about
the tone.  Not saying anything in it that I haven't already said but it's
all in a more flippant and jokey tone.  I don't of course despair of this
anymore than I'm in a constant state of despair about everything - better
than being bored. Bring back melodrama.

Cheers and hopefully no offence caused.

Hi Geraldine,

I saw you at Young Vic on an afternoon AND Festival Hall the next
evening (I think)!  Young Vic was also my intro to the work of
Elizabeth Smart, who had just died -- before the Young Vic
performance a tape of her reading from "By Grand Central Station ...
" was playing.  WOW.  I chased that book down when I got back to the
States (couldn't afford it when I was living/travelling abroad) and
now I teach it in an MFA seminar on book-length prose poems at the
New School.  (Oh --during my residency at Hawthornden Castle in
Scotland I was in a room that Sebastian Barker had previously
occupied the month before!).

> I honestly don't understand their satisfaction with being given a

I wouldn't say there's the kind of "satisfaction"  you get from your
own work.  And I must say I was a little disappointed that the poems
themselves were not, in fact, hilarious.  Or even dirty.  If you're
going to offend, at least have the decency to be obscene.

x, Sharon

p.s.  After I wrote you yesterday I re-read "Spreading the Cards" and
"Tiger Lillies" -- absolutely wonderful.

Not sure we've been over this point yet, but here goes: If the free market
is "open," what does that "open" mean? "Open" to destroy us? Itself? Free
for what? Burdens and choices? Or progress? What's "free" about it?

I would rather it be called the "untethered" or "orderless" market, or,
better, Amok.

one of my fave net art pieces (unfort it isn't online anymore) was such that
you'd type your name into it, whereupon it would generate about 25 pages on
you as a profile. it would do a search on your name (or whomever's name you
typed in) and assemble pictures and text based on that information. and the
texts would key on sentences/paragraphs  culled from the net including your
name.

'jim andrews' is a common name. there is another poet named jim andrews.
there's a porn star named jim andrews. a sports surgeon. a sherrif. and on
and on. so the portrait of 'jim andrews' is quite extensive, and it involves
elements of all these people.

certainly the act of using the internet's vast data is fraught with moral
peril. no question. but, also, it really is tantalizing, as an artist. i use
google+yahoo image search in dbCinema. because you can type something in and
get 5000 related images. how sweet is that? o mi gawd. but then what? what
are you going to do with them? the art is not simply in enabling a google
search but in what is done with it.

and, in my opinion, using web services to tap the social scope of the search
term is just so compelling as something for artists to investigate.

of course, that doesn't give anyone permission to act unethically.

i didn't have a problem with steve and jim's project. as jason pointed out,
there are plenty of clues that the 'authors' aren't the real authors. and
it's amusing for those in it to see what they 'wrote'. as steve pointed out,
very like looking at a horoscope and seeing relation with one's life. also,
i admire jim carpenter's poetry generation software. that's hard stuff to
create and he's maybe the best at it. and steve has done a remarkable job
getting it out there, in the concept, in the framing.

rest assured that what we are seeing now is the tip of the iceberg
concerning artists using the vast resources of the internet to create new
work. if steve and jim's project scared you, hold on to your hat.

the moral issues that arise have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

Neither Bush has been a friend of free markets. The first one termed free market economics "voodoo economics." So don't give me that nonsense. You are right, though, that every economy is mixed. However, those that are freest produce the most wealth and benefit the poor the most. That motto, by the way, belongs not to any free market economy, but to the soviet bloc, and had in fact that result. It's Leftist materialists who think everything it economic, not those of us who support free markets.

Troy, 3 cheers for the unregulated, "open" economy. Your guy, Bush 43, & Greenspan have done wonders for the average wallet. Gosh, what most people wouldn't give for a little entrophy now. & besides, what economy isn't mixed. Socialism, as in sane governance/mixed economies works well enough, ain't nothing wrong with the 2 hour lunch breaks and early retirement favored by Joe Sixpack Frenchman in France. Seems the quality of life is ok in old Europe, meaning, avoid the East for awhile.  Besides, don't people get bored with the same old motto: Produce/Produce/Produce, a slogan that's done wonders for the enviroment.

The financial crisis is not even remotely as you portray it.  There is nothing in the area of finance not regulated, and anyone who told you otherwise was lying to you.

Believing in evolution is not ideological; not believing in it is.
Believing in a heliocentric solar system is not ideological; not believing in it is.
Believing in the spontaneous order known as the free market system of economics is not ideological; not believing in it is.

My anthropological approach does not excuse slavery any more than it excuses poverty. What it allows us to do is understand the origins of poverty, that it is a natural state, that wealth is new and something that we should be trying to get more people into. But wealth is not the natural state of things, and the wealth of others does not cause poverty in others. Historically, the wealth of others, especially in free market situations, allows for the wealth of others. THe world is not a zero-sum game.

Troy,

You mean "believing in a free market" is not ideological? The, only not
believing in it is? That more or less sounds nonsensical to me. Have you
been following the congressional hearings at all? As it is turning out, the
credit swaps, which were completely unregulated and unobserved (your
"natural" state of the world) and with a size of over forty trillion at the
root of a lot of our present financial problems, were nothing but a casino
in the sky, the wizard of Oz turning out to be a mountebank.

As for your "anthropoligical" analysis, if we encounter slavery today, we
should tolerate it because it has existed before.

Ciao,

much that has been done in the name of socialism is barbaric.  Orwell longed for a humane brand of Socialism. & much of Europe, not the East, seems to be moving in that direction. The 2 party system in the States is morally and intellectually broke.

In an open system, you necessarily have to have energy coming into and exiting from the system. As the occurs, internal order is created -- an order that lies on the borderline of order and chaos, also known as creative destruction. In other words, it is a self-organizing system. It is liberals who want us to be free of burdens and choices. Freedom does not mean that, as it cannot be separated from responsibility. Freedom does not mean anarchy, but rather the implementation of the best rules to make the system creative. Note that I said "rules" and not "laws," as the former are flexible and can be bent, but the latter are inflexible and cannot be broken. Thus, the market is not orderless, but rather is a spontaneous order, ordered by no one person or group of people, but emergent from the activities of everyone.

Not sure we've been over this point yet, but here goes: If the free market
is "open," what does that "open" mean? "Open" to destroy us? Itself? Free
for what? Burdens and choices? Or progress? What's "free" about it?

I would rather it be called the "untethered" or "orderless" market, or,
better, Amok.

I think my point, as my thinking develops on this, is that perhaps
there is a sense in which our names are not ours at all. rather they
belong to the community as signifiers of us, but that use doesn't
limit them from being used in other ways. names are perhaps the most
public of language. wittgenstein would suggest that a use of a name
is meaningful if there are public criteria by which the particular
use can be determined to be used correctly or not. i'm inlcined to
agree with that sort of thinking, and as such think that the correct
reading of this is that these names are used en masse in a group of
writer's names. it is clear from the content that none of the writers
listed actually wrote this stuff. so i'm inclined to think that the
meaning in this is that this is a list of writers, here are some
poets they didn't write, and as such this is a use of a name that is
very different from the normal sorts of uses that we think of for
names, such as signing work, hailing someone, or specifying a
specific person.

the interesting thing here then is to ask whether the use of your or
my or geraldine monk's or shakespeare's name is meaningful at all. i
think it is, and am inclined to read it in the way that nick piombino
mentioned and that silliman hinted at in his blog post about the
topic. that is, these things function as a signifier of our communal
stewardship of the language as writers, even those on the list who
aren't poets, and further that there is something here in the
questioning of authorship in the age of authorial identity through
textual communication the likes of whcih so much of our socialization
revolves around.

as such it as value and meaning and is a good thing.

or maybe i really ought to go back to a one fall cage match and shut
the hell up.

I'm surprised at this. For one thing I'm never sure what "the writers of
this work" means, especially when online work is considered. Second, if
'real people's' names weren't used, the anthology would lose its axis;
it's about, among other things, poetics and the 'poetry world,' such as it
is - not an attempt to create a fictitous school of writing.

Third I'm not sure about the 'essential nature of the writtenness of
computer programs' - why this is essential. And it doesn't spout
post-human or other theory - you're making the connection - one might just
as easily see it as the last gauge of romanticism.

Why on earth a 'test'? If I write something, say this, is this also a
'test'? Is it a 'test' if you can't locate intentionality in the - what?
word choice, method of composition, thing itself?

Does the writer read his work? Do all writers read their work? Does
Kenneth Goldsmith? I've known writers who don't in fact; I think we all
must.

How does he know it's poetry? Is there a test about what's poetry and not?
What's bad poetry and not?

I think harvesting names is wonderful, and a text which (you say) is one
substance is fascinating and raises a lot of interesting questions about
aesthetics, Kant, sublime of course, etc.

What bothers me on this list most of all is that I think what was produced
was and is amazing, brilliant, and I worry that the authors etc. will
back-track. I wish I had done it. And it's raised as much discussion if
not more than Yasusada did, or is that another bad person thing?

That is the point, of course. That there is no "public readership" other than us (those whose names are in the anthology). The joke is on us and for us, no one else. That's what makes it funny.

Hmm, I was surprised to find my name there. A friend told me I was
there, so I checked. My 'fame' gland was momentarily excited - but
then I read the poem. My 'shame' gland leapt into life. Awful; no
redeeming features at all. I was disappointed in them portraying me
like that. What if somebody should even half-way believe it was mine?
Awful. An absolutely strange mix of 'poets' - just names drawn out of
a cyber hat. I feel used - I laughed at the project until I found
myself in it - so much work for what? It isn't even a good sham in as
much as I doubt there is a public readership out there who would
believe in it. Too much exposure has happened for that to be achieved.

... but a fun game for those who created it. That is all. It would be
doubly cool if the perpetrators now offered us a 'true' anthology with
OUR poems in it as Issue 2.

I'm finding the relationship between this thread and the fake anthology thr=
ead peculiarly similar.

Troy, I'm gonna have to call you out on this one, though, because, like Mur=
at, I wonder if you are for real.=A0 Are you an algorithm of capitalist spe=
ak that strings together coarse rhetoric?=A0 I'm sorry, this is not a perso=
nal attack, but I sometimes wonder if neo-con, economic-terrorists should b=
e pursued for espousing their brand of un-information (not misinformation, =
just information that isn't complete and is more self-serving, ie your the-=
wealthy-should-be-appreciated bent; I mean, could you shove your nose up th=
ere any farther?=A0 The poor should appreciate the wealthy so that the weal=
thy can have a population on which to regulate wealth.=A0 This teeters on
 hate speech, Troy.=20

I remember a comment by the IMF (or world bank?) VP a few years back, somet=
hing about how third world countries should accept waste from first world c=
ountries since they have nothing better going on anyway.

I'm glad you brought up the anthropological approach, because economics is =
a biological science, a label most economists would resist, I'm sure.=A0 Th=
e
 predominant world view (think indigenous American, if it helps
 you) holds that when an open system is functioning properly, wealth is nat=
urally occurring and poverty is the deviate.=A0 When an open system, (think=
 agriculture) is functioning properly (rain, sun, soil) it is self-sustaini=
ng.=A0 As example, I don't have to do anything to my apple trees, and they =
provide me with a wealth of apples.=A0 However, if we get an unusual freeze=
 that kills the blossoms, I don't get squat for apples.

Another example, think buffalo - to continue my first-peoples thread - hoar=
ding and fencing property for personal gain prevented access of animals and=
 of people, and the mass slaughter of animals created wealth for one people=
, and suppressed another people, to say the least.=A0 And that was certainl=
y not "naturally" occurring.

But I suppose our arguments depend on our definitions of wealth.=A0 Yours, =
I suspect, is monetarily based, mine is the opposite.=A0 (What is the oppos=
ite of money?)=A0 You see, I think the more wealth one has, the more potent=
ial he/she has to impoverish others.=A0=20
When a wealthy person buys a yacht, for example, can we not see the teak fo=
rests in its deck, the fine silk in its sail?=A0 Those resources have more =
wealth potential if they are left standing.=A0 Every time we spend money th=
at means somebody else has to go without something.=A0 But you see, I think=
 that my money isn't really my money,
 it's your money.=A0 And by my
 holding it, I am promising that I will do something with it, not for me, b=
ut for you.=A0 I am promising a return for service or goods, for payment of=
 debt, public or private.=A0 And furthermore, by hoarding it and accumulati=
ng mass wealth, the wealthy are preventing others from returning services o=
r goods and living in a self-sustaining way.=A0=A0Biologically speaking.

Even President Eisenhower understood it.=A0 He said something like, every t=
ime a bullet is fired or a warship is launched, that means people are going=
 without food, or clothes, or roofs over their heads.

Wealth causes poverty; accumulating and using it for personal gain is dange=
rous.=20

I didn't even scratch the $700b bailout surface.=A0 Private profits, social=
 debt, do you really need it explained?

I believe in free markets.=A0 But the market we are living with is not a fr=
ee market.=A0 It is heavily governed and regulated by the
 wealthiest people in our population.

But these are my beliefs, I don't portend to impose.=A0 I've worked with ec=
onomists, but I am not an economist.

Troy,

You mean "believing in a free market" is not ideological? The, only

believing in it is? That more or less sounds nonsensical to me. Have you
been following the congressional hearings at all? As it is turning out, the
credit swaps, which were completely unregulated and unobserved (your

root of a lot of our present financial problems, were nothing but a casino

As for your

today, we
should tolerate it because it has existed before.

Troy,

I'm not satisfied in saying that liberals are those that seek an end to
responsibility, tho' I'm sure you can cite examples. I've always taken
"liberal" to mean not drawing on a fear of the future to dictate decision as
rote -- that our "freedom" (with its burdens of decision) cannot mean
"algorithm." (While we're at it, how do you differentiate burden/choice from
Sartrean existentialism? And why does freedom not mean anarchy? Surely there
are choices when no established order exists? Surely when there is nothing
there are greater freedoms? Could this have been what Bush had in mind when
he sent troops -- soldiers -- to destroy a foreign "power", thus eradicating
all remnants of anything, establishing a "nothing" in its place?)

My questions and doubts aside, if this system exists spontaneously, it seems
to exist outside of society. I recognize this, but I also reject the idea
that the market should be left on its own, since its very spontaneity
categorizes it as dangerous and anti-social. Individuals engaging in
activities with the goal of bringing about such spontaneity should be viewed
as anti-democratic, and need regulation at best.

In American democracy, the Freedom, the burden, is reworked into Liberty
(sometimes civil, sometimes human, sometimes viewed as a "right") that there
are things we cannot do. We're free to murder, but we're not at liberty to
do so; our burden is relaxed. [An aside: It's interesting to note that in
Romance languages such as Spanish (and I assume French too) that liberty/la
libertad functions to mean both freedom and liberty.] To differentiate
between Freedom and Liberty was something our fledgling government sought.
So it's not that we're burdened by a social contract, but nor are we to be
held bound to burdens imposed by a corporate class. The emergence of said
class isn't part of society, since it cannot partake in the liberties
afforded to citizens. [Laws have, of course, been passed to give human
rights and recognition to corporations; but the difference is plain in most
cases, i.e., you cannot commit a hate crime against a corporation.] The
architects of democracy, never all-knowing but well aware of this, knew this
corporatism would seek to shift burden, in the name of freedom, to the
citizenry. An open system is "free" to do this, but it certainly isn't at
"liberty" to do so, and regulation establishes that this gap between freedom
and liberty exists, and further seeks to fill it by rule of law, which
should always come before the narrow binary of profit/loss. Since an open
system demands it be regulated in order to not collapse on itself, it cannot
be considered open, as such a move would be akin to calling a dictatorship a
"participatory democracy."

thanks for the questions

 I'm surprised at this. For one thing I'm never sure what "the writers of
> this work" means, especially when online work is considered.


just because it is online doesn't mean there aren't writers, and they can't
be determined

Is it?  I'm not convinced, especially not by virtue of the text.

>

It seems to me essential that computer programs are written and that
computer languages are largely English-based.  I have long placed a value
this way.  This leads me to say that, for instance, computer garbage on a
VAX was written by all the users of the VAX as well as the programmers and
perhaps some of the designers; in a similar fashion, I argue the anthology
was written -- more so, more so than a garbage file -- ; and then I learn
that it is a sort of super advanced gnoetry that doesn't use a deliberate
aiming perhaps?  I dunno.

But it does, because I think a guy in a room wrote the thing and pretended
that 3000 people with some duplicates, non-poets, and spoofs did, to show
what?

Why on earth a 'test'? If I write something, say this, is it also a 'test'?
Is it a 'test' if you can't locate intentionality in the - what? word
choice, method of composition, thing itself?

If a person writes it, it is tested by reading and revising; if I have a
test bed of stuff and run it through my program, that is also called a
test.

Does the writer read his work? Do all writers read their work? Does Kenneth
Goldsmith? I've known writers who don't in fact; I think we all must.

How does he know it's poetry? Is there a test about what's poetry and not?
What's bad poetry and not?

But this is the prime area of my concern; Kenneth at least proofs the
majority of his work:  that involves reading of a sort.  By publishing it as
poetry, at least he and / or his editor or publisher call it poetry because
they make the similie:  they publish it as poetry.  But here, a writer and
an editor called it poetry for the very overt signs that make it bad and
because they ascribe it to poets who call themselves poets.

I think harvesting names is wonderful, and a text which (you say) is one
substance is fascinating and raises a lot of interesting questions about
aesthetics, Kant, sublime of course, etc.

I don't, but I don't care for Kant much either.

I had to go back and reread The Barrel Organ (1938) by Alfred Noyes after I
alluded to the poem at the end of my last post. I hadn't remembered these
lines:

"There's a thief, perhaps, that listens with a face of frozen stone
  In the City as the sun sinks low;
There's a portly man of business with a balance of his own,
There's a clerk and there's a butcher of a soft reposeful tone,
And they're all of them returning to the heavens they have known:
They are crammed and jammed in busses and--they're each of them alone
  In the land where the dead dreams go.
There's a labourer that listens to the voices of the dead
  In the City as the sun sinks low;
And his hand begins to tremble and his face is rather red
As he sees a loafer watching him and--there he turns his head
And stares into the sunset where his April love is fled,
For he hears her softly singing and his lonely soul is led
  Through the land where the dead dreams go...
There's a barrel-organ carolling across a golden street
  In the City as the sun sinks low;
Though the music's only Verdi there's a world to make it sweet
Just as yonder yellow sunset where the earth and heaven meet
Mellows all the sooty City! Hark, a hundred thousand feet
Are marching on to glory through the poppies and the wheat
  In the land where the dead dreams go."

Nick

ng=0Aabout that huge sudden ironic parody that calls for instant recognitio=

=0Alightness of blogging" as I once termed it, par excellence. A poetry cir=
cus=0Awagon blows in, warm wind and ill wind, spins a few sails, shakes a f=

It's interesting that Troy argues for an open system in economics, but his poetics are closed closed closed.

In an open system, you necessarily have to have energy coming into and exiting from the system. As the occurs, internal order is created -- an order that lies on the borderline of order and chaos, also known as creative destruction. In other words, it is a self-organizing system. It is liberals who want us to be free of burdens and choices. Freedom does not mean that, as it cannot be separated from responsibility. Freedom does not mean anarchy, but rather the implementation of the best rules to make the system creative. Note that I said "rules" and not "laws," as the former are flexible and can be bent, but the latter are inflexible and cannot be broken. Thus, the market is not orderless, but rather is a spontaneous order, ordered by no one person or group of people, but emergent from the activities of everyone.

Not sure we've been over this point yet, but here goes: If the free market
is "open," what does that "open" mean? "Open" to destroy us? Itself? Free
for what? Burdens and choices? Or progress? What's "free" about it?

I would rather it be called the "untethered" or "orderless" market, or,
better, Amok.

This is a very interesting point, Catherine, that hasn't been brought out u=

 True, and the same could have been said of a sonnet in relation to a haiku=
. There is some essential connection between the scale of one's overall for=

France's Le Clezio wins Nobel literature prize

 By MATT MOORE and KARL RITTER, Associated Press Writers * 6 minutes ago*

STOCKHOLM, Sweden - France's Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio won the 2008 Nobe=
l
Prize in literature on Thursday for works characterized by "poetic adventur=
e
and sensual ecstasy" and focused on the environment, especially the desert.

Le Clezio, 68, is the first French writer to win the prestigious award sinc=
e
Chinese-born Frenchman Gao Xingjian was honored in 2000.

The decision was in line with the Swedish Academy's recent picks of Europea=
n
authors. Last year's prize went to Doris Lessing of Britain.

The academy called Le Clezio an "author of new departures, poetic adventure
and sensual ecstasy, explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning
civilization."

Le Clezio made his breakthrough as a novelist with "Desert," in 1980, a wor=
k
the academy said "contains magnificent images of a lost culture in the Nort=
h
African desert contrasted with a depiction of Europe seen through the eyes
of unwanted immigrants."

That novel, which also won Le Clezio a prize from the French Academy, is
considered a masterpiece. It describes the ordeal of Lalla, a woman from th=
e
Tuareg nomadic tribe of the Sahara Desert, as she adapts to civilization
imposed by colonial France at the beginning of the 20th century.

The Swedish Academy said Le Clezio from early on "stood out as an
ecologically engaged author, an orientation that is accentuated with the
novels 'Terra Amata,' 'The Book of Flights,' 'War' and 'The Giants.'"

Le Clezio told Swedish Radio he was busy reading when a member of the
academy phoned him on his wife's telephone to announce the news.

"I am very touched and very emotional, it is a great honor for me," he said=
.

Le Clezio described himself as "born of a mix, like many people currently i=
n
Europe." He said while he was born in France, his father was British.

He was already planning to travel to Sweden later this month to receive
another award =97 the Stig Dagerman prize, which honors efforts to promote =
the
freedom of expression.

Since Japanese writer Kenzaburo Oe won the award in 1994, the selections
have had a distinctly European flavor. Since then 12 Europeans, including L=
e
Clezio, have won the prize. The last U.S. writer to win the prize was Toni
Morrison in 1993.

Last week, Academy Permanent Secretary Horace Engdahl told The Associated
Press that the United States is too insular and ignorant to challenge Europ=
e
as the center of the literary world. The comments were met with fierce
reactions from across the Atlantic, where the head of the U.S. National Boo=
k
Foundation offered to send Engdahl a reading list.

"I was very surprised that the reaction was so violent. I don't think that
what I said was that derogatory or sensational," Engdahl told AP after
Thursday's prize announcement.

He added that his comments had been "perhaps a bit too generalizing."

Asked how he thought the choice of Le Clezio would be received in the Unite=
d
States, he said he had no idea.

"I'm not aware that there are today any anti-French sentiments in the U.S.,=
"
Engdahl said.

"He's not a particularly French writer if you look at him from a strictly
cultural point of view. So I don't think this choice will give rise to any
anti-French comments," he said. "I would be very sad if that was the case."

Le Clezio has spent much of his time living in New Mexico in recent years.
He has long shied away from public life, spending much of his time
traveling, often in the world's various deserts.

He has published several dozen books, including novels and essays. The most
famous are tales of nomads, mediations on the desert and childhood memories=
.
He has also explored the mythologies of native Americans, who have long
fascinated him.

Engdahl called Le Clezio a writer of great diversity.

"He has gone through many different phases of his development as a writer
and has come to include other civilizations, other modes of living than the
Western, in his writing," Engdahl said.

Le Clezio was born in Nice in 1940 and at eight the family moved to Nigeria=
,
where his father had been a doctor during World War II. They returned to
France in 1950.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy hailed Le Clezio's win.

"A child in Mauritius and Nigeria, a teenager in Nice, a nomad of the
American and African deserts, Jean-Marie Le Clezio is a citizen of the
world, the son of all continents and cultures," Sarkozy said. "A great
traveler, he embodies the influence of France, its culture and its values i=
n
a globalized world."

In addition to the 10 million kronor (US$1.4 million) check, Le Clezio will
also receive a gold medal and be invited to give a lecture at the academy's
headquarters in Stockholm's Old Town.

The Nobel Prize in literature is handed out in Stockholm on Dec. 10 =97 the
anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896 =97 along with the awards in medicine,
chemistry, physics and economics. The Nobel Peace Prize is presented in Osl=
o,
Norway.

I think my point, as my thinking develops on this, is that perhaps
there is a sense in which our names are not ours at all. rather they
belong to the community as signifiers of us, but that use doesn't
limit them from being used in other ways. names are perhaps the most
public of language. wittgenstein would suggest that a use of a name
is meaningful if there are public criteria by which the particular
use can be determined to be used correctly or not. i'm inlcined to
agree with that sort of thinking, and as such think that the correct
reading of this is that these names are used en masse in a group of
writer's names. it is clear from the content that none of the writers
listed actually wrote this stuff. so i'm inclined to think that the
meaning in this is that this is a list of writers, here are some
poets they didn't write, and as such this is a use of a name that is
very different from the normal sorts of uses that we think of for
names, such as signing work, hailing someone, or specifying a
specific person.

the interesting thing here then is to ask whether the use of your or
my or geraldine monk's or shakespeare's name is meaningful at all. i
think it is, and am inclined to read it in the way that nick piombino
mentioned and that silliman hinted at in his blog post about the
topic. that is, these things function as a signifier of our communal
stewardship of the language as writers, even those on the list who
aren't poets, and further that there is something here in the
questioning of authorship in the age of authorial identity through
textual communication the likes of whcih so much of our socialization
revolves around.

as such it as value and meaning and is a good thing.

or maybe i really ought to go back to a one fall cage match and shut
the hell up.

I'm finding the relationship between this thread and the fake anthology thread peculiarly similar.

Troy,
I'm gonna have to call you out on this one, though, because, like
Murat, I wonder if you are for real.  Are you an algorithm of
capitalist speak that strings together coarse rhetoric?  I'm sorry,
this is not a personal attack, but I sometimes wonder if neo-con,
economic-terrorists should be pursued for espousing their brand of
un-information (not misinformation, just information that isn't
complete and is more self-serving, ie your
the-wealthy-should-be-appreciated bent; I mean, could you shove your
nose up there any farther?  The poor should appreciate the wealthy so
that the wealthy can have a population on which to regulate wealth.
This teeters on
hate speech, Troy.

I remember a comment by
the IMF (or world bank?) VP a few years back, something about how third
world countries should accept waste from first world countries since
they have nothing better going on anyway.

I'm glad you brought
up the anthropological approach, because economics is a biological
science, a label most economists would resist, I'm sure.  The
predominant world view (think indigenous American, if it helps
you) holds that when an open system is functioning properly, wealth is
naturally occurring and poverty is the deviate.  When an open system,
(think agriculture) is functioning properly (rain, sun, soil) it is
self-sustaining.  As example, I don't have to do anything to my apple
trees, and they provide me with a wealth of apples.  However, if we get
an unusual freeze that kills the blossoms, I don't get squat for apples.

Another
example, think buffalo - to continue my first-peoples thread - hoarding
and fencing property for personal gain prevented access of animals and
of people, and the mass slaughter of animals created wealth for one
people, and suppressed another people, to say the least.  And that was
certainly not "naturally" occurring.

But I suppose our arguments
depend on our definitions of wealth.  Yours, I suspect, is monetarily
based, mine is the opposite.  (What is the opposite of money?)  You
see, I think the more wealth one has, the more potential he/she has to
impoverish others.
When a wealthy person buys a yacht, for
example, can we not see the teak forests in its deck, the fine silk in
its sail?  Those resources have more wealth potential if they are left
standing.  Every time we spend money that means somebody else has to go
without something.  But you see, I think that my money isn't really my
money,
it's your money.  And by my
holding it, I am promising
that I will do something with it, not for me, but for you.  I am
promising a return for service or goods, for payment of debt, public or
private.  And furthermore, by hoarding it and accumulating mass wealth,
the wealthy are preventing others from returning services or goods and
living in a self-sustaining way.  Biologically speaking.

Even
President Eisenhower understood it.  He said something like, every time
a bullet is fired or a warship is launched, that means people are going
without food, or clothes, or roofs over their heads.

Wealth causes poverty; accumulating and using it for personal gain is dangerous.

I didn't even scratch the $700b bailout surface.  Private profits, social debt, do you really need it explained?

I believe in free markets.  But the market we are living with is not a free market.  It is heavily governed and regulated by the
wealthiest people in our population.

But these are my beliefs, I don't portend to impose.  I've worked with economists, but I am not an economist.

Eric

The financial crisis is not even remotely as you portray it.  There is nothing
in the area of finance not regulated, and anyone who told you otherwise was
lying to you.

Believing in evolution is not ideological; not believing in it is.
Believing in a heliocentric solar system is not ideological; not believing in
it is.
Believing in the spontaneous order known as the free market system of economics
is not ideological; not believing in it is.

My anthropological approach does not excuse slavery any more than it excuses
poverty. What it allows us to do is understand the origins of poverty, that it
is a natural state, that wealth is new and something that we should be trying to
get more people into. But wealth is not the natural state of things, and the
wealth of others does not cause poverty in others.

Historically,
the wealth of
others, especially in free market situations, allows for the wealth of others.
THe world is not a zero-sum game.

Troy,

You mean "believing in a free market" is not ideological? The, only
not
believing in it is? That more or less sounds nonsensical to me. Have you
been following the congressional hearings at all? As it is turning out, the
credit swaps, which were completely unregulated and unobserved (your
"natural" state of the world) and with a size of over forty trillion
at the
root of a lot of our present financial problems, were nothing but a casino
in the sky, the wizard of Oz turning out to be a mountebank.

As for your
"anthropoligical"
analysis, if we
encounter slavery
today, we
should tolerate it because it has existed before.

Ciao,

Murat

The idea that there is any sort of life experience that can prepare =20

has become a political issue because the McCain campaign taking a =20

If you look say at Jeremy Hight's work, he might have written part of it

Which brings up perhaps the main point, how should the text be judged? My
poem wasn't particularly good by whatever standards of poetry I might have
but some of the writing is brilliant, as one might expect from generated
texts. So in a way I'd argue that the texts are readerly, not writerly, if
that distinction holds - they're there for the culling or skimming. What
does disappear is individual intention or differentiated intention from
one piece to another, which places them within the aegis, I think, yes, of
the weather - although not a natural phenomenon, there's something chaotic
(in the sense of chaos theory) about the results here.

Well a lot of languages, experimental languages for one thing, aren't
English-based, and this is changing in general - what you're talking about
I think of as historic happenstance (especially with the VAX!), not
intrinsic to programming. There are also a great many programs today
written by programs, and while one may well trace this back to human
origin, sooner or later, I think this becomes less and less relevant in
time; sooner or later, programs might be seen as relatively autonomous
structures in this sense. And programming for that matter is now as much a
matter of 'borrowing' - modules, subroutines, etc. - as it is of 'writing'
- to the extent that one might see the anthology as a metaphor for pro-
gramming among other things, which makes it more interesting. I read part
of it with Adam Tobin, looking for clues about the program itself - for
example the types of parallel structures, for me more than the vocabulary.

What could be more romantic than this? You've conjured up the garrett and
the Lautreamontian borrowing, plagiarism, etc. And to show what? Surely
this extended dialog on Poetis indicates that a lot of things are shown.

Well, there's an essential difference which was primary at the codework
conference we had in W Virginia; if you make an error in a program, it's
likely not to run at all and need correcting - there's a bifurcation here
- if you make an error in writing or creative programming, it may well
lead you on to something else. I don't like 'test' which implies results,
just as 'experimental' implies a. that ALL poets aren't experimenting when
writing, and b. that poems must GIVE RESULTS and pass or fail according to
some sort of abstract standards.

What's really at issue here, no one seems to be commenting on this, is
notions of _community_ - the author list implies a community, some people
think they're part of a 'poetry community,' this list is a community of
sorts, and so forth.

I've done a lot of proof-reading and one can certainly do this without
reading (at least I could, but then I might not be a good proof-reader!).

Not all poets call themselves poets - a minor point, but one that comes up
at every conference on electronic literature or digital media I've been
to. So the term might in some circumstances be problematic, as it is here
- but it's this very problematic that's healthy for poetry and poetics.
I'm always surprised at the conservatism of the Poetics list for example,
when there are absolutely amazing things going on in digital domains, in
literature and new media, that aren't really covered here. So the
anthology is a crack in this facade, so to speak, a sign that things are
more open than one might have thought. The anthology _depends on_ the Net
and computation; if it were 'just' a print publication, it wouldn't have
created a stir.

A few days ago I wrote a letter here re anthologies and prisons, who filling
them may in some ways be analogous.  And, with the use of the Internet at
one's fingertips, made all the easier!

That is to say, the compiling of lists of both "poets" and "suspects" is
made much easier, as well as, if need, the retrieval of quite a bit of data
about any of the names one has come across by whatever method.

The suppying of the poems/evidences by a machine--"an anonymous
source"--adds an air of mystery and confusion does it not--?  For after all,
there is an appeal to the vanity or the the affront to the insecurity of the
poet/suspect upon reading the charges/poems laid against them.

The Internet is not only a source of information, but also a megasource for
the megaproduction of propaganda, disinformation, dis-translations,
re-editings of entries and re workings of maps.  There are anumber of groups
dedicated to just such tasks, some of them open and publicly proud like
CAMERA which alters any site with maps and information on Israel-Palestine
to erase the Palestinian presences, towns, etc--with those CAMERA sees fit
to supply.  Then there a host of more "under cover" operations and operators
at work also, going about steadily eating away at the structures of
knowledge like so many termites eating away at the old Colonial homes of the
Master or the rotting shnty towns of the "wrteched of the Earth."

When studying even the antholgoies easily availble of for example ancient
Greek lyric poets, or pre-Socratic thinkers, it is very difficult for the
foremost of scholars to establish always with any real certainty who wrote
what and when--and what is simply a poem written "after" the style and
diction of the copied Master or Sappho, the Ultimate Lyric Poet,  or may be
a few lines "quoted" from a long lost original and included in an otherise
shoddy "late Hellnistic Latin job."  How much indeed, of these antholgies
comes down to one as third hand quotes and glosses, and the overheard urban
legnds carted about the Mediterranean by sailors conversing with the would
be Herdotus' of their day?

Much the same meay be said for a great many constructions in words found on
the web, and so the anthology of poems attibruted arbitrarily to this or
that person who is also listed as being a poet-is no surprise, just as it is
no surprise how many persons have come under suspciion and harssement or
arrest simply by being lanted as part of a parcel sent out over the Intenet
mails.

All kinds of amazing "information" can be passed along in this way,and have
the utmost certitude given to it-- --or be passed off  as a kind of
"experiment."  For example, when there was a huge argument at the FBI over
some of the evidence provided by "Curveball" that led tothe War in Iraq--one
of the doubters in Curveball's veracity asked a defener of his all knowing
truths--show me some evidence!  Where did yo find it?  And the evidence
turned out to have been corroborated by some found on line--To which the
doubter responded--where do you think he (Curveball) found it!

There are all sorts of other consequences of things found on line, whther
they are faked or not--at one point there had for the second time been
ciruclating a story attacking the teaching methods of some Muslim schools in
Great Britain--which Leevi Lehto was mass distribtuing.  When it was pointed
out that these stories were fakes, and had been used previously and
exposed--and were now being used again with a lsight change--Lehto responded
that he thought that they might have been not true, but since he agreed with
the cause for which they were being psuhed across the web, he had sent them
on.

In this manner, though someone might know or think they may know a poem
attributed to a poet is indeed not by them, they might still pass it on or
include it elsewhere as by them nonetheless.

I think that these are some of the "other side" of the issues which the idea
of Anthologies itself suggests in relation to prisons, arreests and the
like--that is, that if one may consider how easy it is to create a genration
of fake poets, or genrate an anthology of ake poems--who easy is it not also
to generate a fake generation of suspects and detainees, and to create an
Anthology of them in the form of a prison?

here is the intro to the previous letter, with the link to it (it has
illustrations with it now, too!! how marvelous! indeed is the mighty web--!
that web of the "spider's strategem--")
Wednesday, October 08, 2008  Poetry Anthologies &/As Prisons &
Prisoners<http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com/2008/10/poetry-anthologies-prisons-prisoners.html>
Note:
Recently in the blogosphere there has been a lot of "controversy" among for
the most part American poets over their inclusion or not in an Anthology of
Poetry which is created by a computer program, with the names of the poets
being affixed to the machine-made poems by a process that chooses from
various lists of names. Some of the poets are also non-American and others
still are also dead. (So far there have been no signs of any uproar coming
from the last named's direction.)

Since the Internet is already used to compile all sorts of lists, many of
which can possibly lead to arrests, or the person whose name is being
tracked being counted as a suspect of some kind, involved in anything from a
shoplifting ring to massive identity fraud to "terrorism," the using of
names for a poetry anthology created by amassing computer generated poems
seems relatively innocuous.

Innocuous, that is, unless one begins to think of anthologies themselves as
another form of prison-creation, or prisons as another form of anthology
making.

After all, the throwing together of a seemingly "loosely associated" group
of people under one rubric might seem to designate the persons named and
assembled thereby as a "movement," a "trend," or even a "terrorist cadre,"
made up of several interlinked "sleeper cells." Even if the various "cells"
are unknown to each other, by showing them to be linked in some way by the
over riding theme of the Anthology, one has created of them an overall face
& effect of "Terror," and "Alert," or of a new kind of poetry "that bears
watching in the future."

Since critics and agents often share the same goals of uncovering "secret"
analogies, "hidden" symbolisms,"traces of fragments of the palimpsests of
previous plots," and so forth--it seems quite possible that a critic could
turn out to be an "undercover" agent--seeking for what is indeed "between
the covers of the book," as, after all, the agent/critic continually reminds
one, "you can't judge a book by the cover." And that person who claims to be
an agent in the field working for the government might well turn out after
all to be no more than just another critic desperately hunting for the next
"great and sobering poetic discovery," the next "pre-teen prodigy of poesy."
or "the latest previously unknown towering genius, all these years lost in
the back lands, hidden among the knitting and the sheep."

Whoever they are, whatever they are up to, the Internet, so rife with names
and information about the names, is a regular Happy Hunting ground beyond
the wildest dreams of Ernest Hemingway set loose in a Protected Wild Life
preserve for those who are hot on the heels of compiling Anthologies, let
alone filling prisons, or committing kidnappings for huge ransoms, or
uncovering the Babylonian origins of the Sicilian Code.

So here are some thoughts addressed to this topic--
to while away the time of one's sentence--
a continually postponed hearing--
where death row and publisher's row
are the same place

The U. S. Constitution says "No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this
Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall
any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age
of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United
States."

Those are the only "Qualifications" to be President of the United States.
Naturally, since the Vice President has to assume the Presidency in case of
the office being vacated for whatever reason, the qualifications for Vice
President are the same as for President. Given those criteria, Palin is
absolutely 'qualified.'  What we should be asking, however,  is this:  "Is
Sarah Palin _fit_ to be President?"

If Obama is qualified to be President with his pathetically thin resume,
then
Palin is certainly qualified to be Vice President. Your hypocrisy on this is
ridiculous. And I'm not even concerned with "being qualified," as
the history of those who have been "qualified" does not exactly
inspire confidence.

that includes (I think) Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, the
Palestinian territories, Egypt, Libya, Tunesia and Algeria, and constitutes
upwards of 10,000 persons.  A good percentage of those in it use generic
email
servers, Hotmail, Live, Yahoo, etc., so they can all vote with alacrity and
the
necessary fearlessness that they will not be discovered as non-Americans.

Since most people will vote in THAT poll  (and the general election)
driven by some emotional connect other than perhaps some agitprop
given off by a tally win.

Personally, I'm repulsed by her and by her politics, as well as what I
perceive to be the roots of her politics, so, yeah, I'd be votinging with
my emoticons too.

Gerald S.

The idea that there is any sort of life experience that can prepare
one for the presidency of the united states is in itself absurd. it
has become a political issue because the McCain campaign taking a
tack from the Clinton campaign, has made the issue of "experience" a
question in the political dialog. While this by itself is absurd, the
fact that they have undercut their own argument in the selection of
Sarah Palin is even more so.

France's Le Clezio wins Nobel literature prize

 By MATT MOORE and KARL RITTER, Associated Press Writers * 6 minutes ago*

STOCKHOLM, Sweden - France's Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio won the 2008
Nobel
Prize in literature on Thursday for works characterized by "poetic
adventure
and sensual ecstasy" and focused on the environment, especially the
desert.

Le Clezio, 68, is the first French writer to win the prestigious award sinc=
e
Chinese-born Frenchman Gao Xingjian was honored in 2000.

The decision was in line with the Swedish Academy's recent picks of
European
authors. Last year's prize went to Doris Lessing of Britain.

The academy called Le Clezio an "author of new departures, poetic
adventure
and sensual ecstasy, explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning
civilization."

Le Clezio made his breakthrough as a novelist with "Desert," in 1980,
a work
the academy said "contains magnificent images of a lost culture in the
North
African desert contrasted with a depiction of Europe seen through the eyes
of unwanted immigrants."

That novel, which also won Le Clezio a prize from the French Academy, is
considered a masterpiece. It describes the ordeal of Lalla, a woman from th=
e
Tuareg nomadic tribe of the Sahara Desert, as she adapts to civilization
imposed by colonial France at the beginning of the 20th century.

The Swedish Academy said Le Clezio from early on "stood out as an
ecologically engaged author, an orientation that is accentuated with the
novels 'Terra Amata,' 'The Book of Flights,' 'War' and
'The Giants.'"

Le Clezio told Swedish Radio he was busy reading when a member of the
academy phoned him on his wife's telephone to announce the news.

"I am very touched and very emotional, it is a great honor for me,"
he said.

Le Clezio described himself as "born of a mix, like many people currently
in
Europe." He said while he was born in France, his father was British.

He was already planning to travel to Sweden later this month to receive
another award =97 the Stig Dagerman prize, which honors efforts to promote =
the
freedom of expression.

Since Japanese writer Kenzaburo Oe won the award in 1994, the selections
have had a distinctly European flavor. Since then 12 Europeans, including L=
e
Clezio, have won the prize. The last U.S. writer to win the prize was Toni
Morrison in 1993.

Last week, Academy Permanent Secretary Horace Engdahl told The Associated
Press that the United States is too insular and ignorant to challenge Europ=
e
as the center of the literary world. The comments were met with fierce
reactions from across the Atlantic, where the head of the U.S. National Boo=
k
Foundation offered to send Engdahl a reading list.

"I was very surprised that the reaction was so violent. I don't think
that
what I said was that derogatory or sensational," Engdahl told AP after
Thursday's prize announcement.

He added that his comments had been "perhaps a bit too generalizing."

Asked how he thought the choice of Le Clezio would be received in the Unite=
d
States, he said he had no idea.

"I'm not aware that there are today any anti-French sentiments in the
U.S.,"
Engdahl said.

"He's not a particularly French writer if you look at him from a
strictly
cultural point of view. So I don't think this choice will give rise to any
anti-French comments," he said. "I would be very sad if that was the
case."

Le Clezio has spent much of his time living in New Mexico in recent years.
He has long shied away from public life, spending much of his time
traveling, often in the world's various deserts.

He has published several dozen books, including novels and essays. The most
famous are tales of nomads, mediations on the desert and childhood memories=
.
He has also explored the mythologies of native Americans, who have long
fascinated him.

Engdahl called Le Clezio a writer of great diversity.

"He has gone through many different phases of his development as a writer
and has come to include other civilizations, other modes of living than the
Western, in his writing," Engdahl said.

Le Clezio was born in Nice in 1940 and at eight the family moved to Nigeria=
,
where his father had been a doctor during World War II. They returned to
France in 1950.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy hailed Le Clezio's win.

"A child in Mauritius and Nigeria, a teenager in Nice, a nomad of the
American and African deserts, Jean-Marie Le Clezio is a citizen of the
world, the son of all continents and cultures," Sarkozy said. "A
great
traveler, he embodies the influence of France, its culture and its values i=
n
a globalized world."

In addition to the 10 million kronor (US$1.4 million) check, Le Clezio will
also receive a gold medal and be invited to give a lecture at the academy's
headquarters in Stockholm's Old Town.

The Nobel Prize in literature is handed out in Stockholm on Dec. 10 =97 the
anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896 =97 along with the awards in medicine,
chemistry, physics and economics. The Nobel Peace Prize is presented in Osl=
o,
Norway.

Has anyone google mapped Wasila, AK? Can you even actually "see" Russia?

There's a grand difference, damas y caballeros, between inexperience and
idiocy, and Sarah Palin has been kind enough to show us the latter.

Inexperience, as Mr. Camplin stated, shouldn't keep us from the polls. You
can bet my Obama vote it won't keep me...

In an odd twist on the campaign trail, Gov. Sarah Palin made a viscous
attack on America=B9s cultural landscape, specifically mentioning BlazeVOX
[books] a Buffalo, NY based publisher, as =B3Anti-American and unpatriotic.=B2

Standing before a sea of red T-shirts and homemade signs reading =B3No
Communists!=B2 and =B3Palin=B9s Pitbulls,=B2 Ms. Palin on Tuesday nestled in to her

BlazeVOX [books] as a liberal poetry outlet with a =B3left-wing agenda that=B9s
packaged and prettied up to look good like mainstream poetry.=B2

Mentioning poets as Kent Johnson, Michael Kelleher, Anne Waldman, Ted
Greenwald, and others; and identifying BlazeVOX [books] founder and

Dear Luke,
I suggest Frank O'Hara---deceptively accessible---just the kind of poetry a
non-specialist audience might not find on their own (i.e. Borders).

I think it would be fairly easy in the current environment for someone to
jumble together 3000 pages of pro-terrorist (orgs, politics, slogans,
anarchist handbook instructions for wmd, nearly-secret docs, etc.) and sign
the names of 3000 artists likely to need to enter or leave the US.  I think
all of us know people who, over the past few years, have been scheduled to
speak, or read, or perform, somewhere in the US and were not allowed into
the US.  This person might even do such a thing so that 3000 more articulate
people start battling a bit harder to return the laws to normal.

It would be easy to harvest the names of a group of academics at schools
with a religious mission or at publicly-funded universities where the
legislature has more direct oversight, and write something that would create
job problems for them.

It would be easy to publish a number of anthologies on the "wrong' side of
the culture wars to create an overall impression of poets that would be
untrue:
these are the dark things I thought about when Geraldine mentioned them.
Note they all have to do with human intent -- of a writer, say.

*

I don't see a reason why this particular anthology, since the "poems"
are lineated, couldn't be reformatted with every poem being split into 25
lines, say, and the names also seperated, so that each one of us wrote 3000
x 25! poems.  Except for Quackenbush, who'd write 9000 x 25! poems.

--
All best,
Catherine Daly

You are probably right although Naipaul, Gunter Grass and Pamuk [all winners
since Saramago] are great writers who are still contemporary,
internationally important and inspiring.

I know someone who recently did a brief interview of Saramago. Like fine
wine Saramago is still ageing (84 or 85...) well but doesn't write very
much. Interestingly, he lives in Spain these days, just outside of Madrid. I
didn't know that Saramago was fluent in Spanish.

Don't know anything about Le Clezio. Hopefully someone in the listserv could
tell us more. And about him living in North America......that was warped
humor. Reacting to the Nobel committee's complain about North American
literature, that it is "insular". Somehow this has been a bad week for me.
Something seems to have warped my sense of humor a little too obtuse.
Perhaps Sarah Palin......

Hi all,

I'm creating a contemporary poetry list that will consist of works that have significant literary merit and yet are accessible to a non-specialist audience (think Collins, Dunn, Oliver, Hass, Kooser, Olds etc.). I would be very pleased if you might recommend some authors/works that would fall into this category.

Much appreciated,
Luke

In an open system, you necessarily have to have energy coming into and exiting from the system. As the occurs, internal order is created -- an order that lies on the borderline of order and chaos, also known as creative destruction. In other words, it is a self-organizing system. It is liberals who want us to be free of burdens and choices. Freedom does not mean that, as it cannot be separated from responsibility. Freedom does not mean anarchy, but rather the implementation of the best rules to make the system creative. Note that I said "rules" and not "laws," as the former are flexible and can be bent, but the latter are inflexible and cannot be broken. Thus, the market is not orderless, but rather is a spontaneous order, ordered by no one person or group of people, but emergent from the activities of everyone.

Not sure we've been over this point yet, but here goes: If the free market
is "open," what does that "open" mean? "Open" to destroy us? Itself? Free
for what? Burdens and choices? Or progress? What's "free" about it?

I would rather it be called the "untethered" or "orderless" market, or,
better, Amok.

Subject: Looking for accessible poetry rec's



Hi all,

I'm creating a contemporary poetry list that will consist of works that hav=
e significant literary merit and yet are accessible to a non-specialist aud=
ience (think Collins, Dunn, Oliver, Hass, Kooser, Olds etc.). I would be ve=
ry pleased if you might recommend some authors/works that would fall into t=
his category.

Much appreciated,
Luke

well, I have found that readers are best served by poems that are
interesting to them and as poetry simultaneously, so the "accessible" poets
you mention seem unsuitable to fostering discussion about reading poetry

context?

I had very excellent results teaching a reading poetry course for mostly
adult/nontraditional undergrads that allowed students, with my counsel, to
select whole books of poetry by contemporary authors (I would often list
similar historical authors who were better known), and then write reviews:
the reviews were important, because it reinforced that every reader can have
something valuable to add, for one thing (there were other reasons this
worked particularly well); the course didn't work one term when an old (not
mine) course description about accessible, issue-based poems ran in the
catalog -- we (me, admin, students together) only figured out the problem
when a student asked "when are we going to talk about AIDS?" in class -- I
say this because the student in "English 3xx:  Reading Poetry" came up with
it; not even when are we going to talk about any topic about poetry or
reading, but about an issue.

New York School poems, the shorter ones, can be fun; Gunslinger, movie
poems, too; try local poets historically and now -- the best of the best,
the ones with a familiar place, and the ones reading at local bookshops.

I second Finch for students caught in "Robert Frost is the only poet" zone.

You're using [anthology] I think and by stating this "Innocuous, that is,
unless" seems a kind of problematic baiting that ignores in fact the
freedom and fancy of the particular anthology under question.

You then jump to cells and terrorism, and for me, this jump is a kind of
cell or terror itself, not the thing itself, but an accumulated surplus;
for me if we're going this route, I'll take Mormon.

But then I've edited a number of anthologies.

I think it would be fairly easy in the current environment for someone to
jumble together 3000 pages of pro-terrorist (orgs, politics, slogans,
anarchist handbook instructions for wmd, nearly-secret docs, etc.) and sign
the names of 3000 artists likely to need to enter or leave the US.  I think
all of us know people who, over the past few years, have been scheduled to
speak, or read, or perform, somewhere in the US and were not allowed into
the US.  This person might even do such a thing so that 3000 more articulate
people start battling a bit harder to return the laws to normal.
It would be easy to harvest the names of a group of academics at schools
with a religious mission or at publicly-funded universities where the
legislature has more direct oversight, and write something that would create
job problems for them.

It would be easy to publish a number of anthologies on the "wrong' side of
the culture wars to create an overall impression of poets that would be
untrue:
these are the dark things I thought about when Geraldine mentioned them.
Note they all have to do with human intent -- of a writer, say.

Still, quoting from sustainable aircraft:

"The fact that there are 367,294 Iraqi civilians who we couldn't say are
alive or dead right now is indicative of both the impossibility and the
urgency of the project". Meg Hamill (to write an obit for each)

"The impossibility of the project is not merely a result of that
mathematical sublime..." Diana Hamilton

*

I don't see a reason why this particular anthology, since the "poems"
are lineated, couldn't be reformatted with every poem being split into 25
lines, say, and the names also seperated, so that each one of us wrote 25!
poems out of 3000 x 25! poems .  Except for Quackenbush, who'd write 3 x 25!
poems.  God bless Japes.

The intrinsic mathematical, and mathematically extensible nature of this
raises questions, most of which are boring, but my primary question today
is:  are the poems -- given that a certain number of "cursory readers" and
one "writer" see a homogenity, and a certain number of readers -- and an
editor -- see a divergence: are the recombinant poems actually separable, or
individual poems?

As far as I'm concerned, the right has won, given the way these discus-
sions are going. Yes, you could have 3000 pages of bombs and slaughter,
you could also have 3000 pages of bird behavior, even in "the current
environment," and by this reasoning, you should be suspect of every
single-authored book since Hitler wrote Mein Kampf and who knows what lies
beyond even this simple-minded response of mine, perhaps I have a gun.

So the anthology is now associated with terror, and so is Obama. Great.

Robert Creeley's Library

Granary Books is pleased to offer for sale a selection of more than
1,300 books, pamphlets, manuscripts, correspondence, and related
materials from the library of preeminent American poet Robert Creeley
(1926-2005). This selection is offered as a group, rather than as
individual items, because of the preponderance of archival material
accumulated within the books. Robert Creeley made a practice of
inserting relevant letters, manuscripts, clippings, photographs, and
ephemera into his books, many of which also bear significant
inscriptions, thus making his library an important documentary archive
occupying a rich site for research parallel to the primary repository of
his papers at Stanford University.

Highlights among the author collections particularly rich with
inscriptions and often including important correspondence and other
association and archival material are: Ted Berrigan, Paul Blackburn (14
items), Joe Brainard (12 items), Stan Brakhage, Richard Brautigan (13
items), Basil Bunting (14 items), Tom Clark, Fielding Dawson (33 items),
Diane Di Prima, Edward Dorn (31 items), Robert Duncan and Jess (over 50
items including "Caesar=B9s Gate," Divers Press, 1955, Creeley=B9s copy [1
of 3 =AD letter =B3C=B2] with an original Jess collage and holograph poem by
Duncan), Larry Eigner, Allen Ginsberg (35 items many with excellent
inscriptions), John Hawkes, Anselm Hollo, Ronald Johnson, Joanne Kyger,
Irving Layton (12 items), Denise Levertov (28 items), Alison Lurie,
Michael McClure (42 items), Charles Olson (59 items including several
inscribed), Joel Oppenheimer (including "The Dancer" (1951) with Robert
Rauschenberg, Jargon 2), Ann Quin, Tom Raworth, Aram Saroyan (11 items),
Gary Snyder (including an inscribed copy of "Riprap," Origin Press,
1959), Philip Whalen, John Wieners, Jonathan Williams (26 items authored
by JW including "Garbage Litters the Iron Face of the Sun=B9s Child"
(1951), Jargon 1, along with more than 35 other titles published by the
Jargon Society), and Louis Zukofsky (29 items including "80 Flowers").

The library includes Creeley=B9s personal copies of most of his regular
separate publications (217 items) and contained within many are
inscriptions, annotations, corrections, cards, letters, photographs,
clippings, notes, etc. from Marisol, Edward Dahlberg, Stan Brakhage,
Louis Zukofsky, Sherman Paul, Octavio Paz, Jim Dine, Georg Baselitz,
Walter Hamady, Fielding Dawson, Denise Levertov, among others. Several
of Creeley=B9s collaborations with artists are present including "A Day
Book" with R.B. Kitaj (Graphis, 1972), "Signs" with Georg Baselitz
(Graphicstudio, 2000), and "7 & 6" with Robert Therrien and Michel Butor
(Hoshour Gallery, 1988).

Price and detailed catalog (via pdf) are available on request to
interested institutional clients.

Trawling further afield - into the poetry of song lyrics - might I suggest
Nina Nastasia, Stina Nordenstam and Hope Sandoval.  The sounds are good too!

Dear Troy Camplin,

Interdisciplinarian or no, I think you might be in the wrong place - I sense
there are no converted to preach to here - which is what you seem to be
attempting. I imagined that an interdisciplinarian would have demonstrated
more flexibility of thought and certainly no traces of allegiance to
fascism. Hey anyway, I thought this was a forum for poetry and not politics,
(I know, poetry without politics is a paradox - but politics without poetry
is the fossilization of culture!) so I take back what I said.

Thanks everyone. I very much appreciate your suggestions and comments. =
You may be interested to know that this list isn't just a pet project. =
It will be a sublist in a much more comprehensive literature booklist =
that is currently being produced/put together by a reading institute =
that I work for ( Also, which is neither here nor there, in teach a few =
writing/lit. classes a semester at the local university). The booklist =
is intended to be utilized by adults who would like some guidance in =
advancing their education and reading. Originally the booklist wasn't =
going to have a poetry section, but I successfully argued that, given =
exposure to rich, meaningful, accessible poetry, there is as much =
likelihood as not that the newly engaged reader might spend at least =
some time reading poetry as part of their daily (weekly?) reading diet. =
You can see that this invites all sort of questions about the current =
relationship between poetry and the reading public. In light of the fact =
that the booklist will go out to some 10,000 adults a year, my hope is =
to influence some modest number to re-think their attitudes about and =
engagement with poetry.
=20
Thanks again. Now I have to go read the poets you mention that I'm not =
familiar with!
=20
Luke

well, I have found that readers are best served by poems that are
interesting to them and as poetry simultaneously, so the "accessible" =
poets
you mention seem unsuitable to fostering discussion about reading poetry

context?

I had very excellent results teaching a reading poetry course for mostly
adult/nontraditional undergrads that allowed students, with my counsel, =
to
select whole books of poetry by contemporary authors (I would often list
similar historical authors who were better known), and then write =
reviews:
the reviews were important, because it reinforced that every reader can =
have
something valuable to add, for one thing (there were other reasons this
worked particularly well); the course didn't work one term when an old =
(not
mine) course description about accessible, issue-based poems ran in the
catalog -- we (me, admin, students together) only figured out the =
problem
when a student asked "when are we going to talk about AIDS?" in class -- =
I
say this because the student in "English 3xx:  Reading Poetry" came up =
with
it; not even when are we going to talk about any topic about poetry or
reading, but about an issue.

New York School poems, the shorter ones, can be fun; Gunslinger, movie
poems, too; try local poets historically and now -- the best of the =
best,
the ones with a familiar place, and the ones reading at local bookshops.

I second Finch for students caught in "Robert Frost is the only poet" =
zone.

Dear Alan:

I don't know if you read the entire piece as it is linked to--

I am NOT denying "the freedom and fancy" of this particular anthology nor of
any other. In fact I am *fighting for the Freedom* of ever more Anthologies
to exist and to continue to exist.   I think you misunderstand what I am
writing and in turn deny it its own "freedom and fancy" and refuse to
understand it's point by lumping it with beings going to Heaven and Mormons,
etc. in the tone of mockery used to consign actual ideas to the dustbins of
rubbish of religions the enlightened writer and audeince take to be
superstitions, and so present the ideas as nothing more than a kind of
debased and laughably "irrational" concept.

"Sad but true, folks, "sighs the Wise Sheriff, reassuring the anxious
populace, "all the monkeys ain't at the Zoo!  But don't you worry, we'll
catch'im, this dee-ranged fella. Can't have no smart ass Simians disturbing
the sleep of the Just, now can we?"

In the part of the piece that appeared here some days ago and is linked to,
one of the points is how many lists a person is already on by virtue of the
Internet, how much information about anyone is so easily available, and as
well how easy it is to fabricate information and "evidence," plant false
stories, alter encyclopedia entries, create distransaltions of poems, news
stories, reports, essays.  Photos and videos, voice recordings, everything
is malleable.    The War in Iraq was stated with "proofs" that were
known-to-forged letters and information from an extremely dubious informant,
whose evidence, as I gave an example of, when "proved" by images on line,
was in reality only using the same images on line that the informant had
used to offer as "proofs."

Since one of my ongoing projects is "The New Extreme Experimental American
Poetry and Arts," I am simply using my own "freedom and fancy" to further
examine the rnage of possiblities of the Anthology's mixing of "fake" poems
with "real poets' names" in terms of the ways in which "fake" evidence may
be used to round up "real" suspects.  Or, to create "fake" suspects using
programs producing from already available information "profiles" which make
them seem in terms of the new laws to be "real" threats and so worthy of
apprehension.

Now, from the point of view of a proud Commandant of a First Class prison in
which there is a cross section of various profiled "types," is it not
possible that this person might not speak of his assembled "detainees" as
not simply a "collection," but an Anthology of the various kinds of
"profiles in terrorism?"  You see--there is a gallows humor in all this you
are missing.

I think perhaps what disturbs you may be that for the most part the use of
the Internet and programs in connection with projects is considered from a
"freedom and fancy" perspective while ignoring the immense and often already
actual possibilities for the dystopian uses of exactly the same methods and
media and techniques with which such an Anthology may be produced.

That is, I am using all these examples and questions imaginatively, in order
to say--how the Freedom underlying the production of things filled with
"freedom and fancy" is threatened by the very techonolgies and methods which
it uses.

If this is evidence of religious superstion of some kind to you, perhaps it
is because you might want to dney this?  I do not know--

And, also, I think that there is for a very long now the separation of the
artistic "avant-garde" from its originary connection with the military in
the term "avant-garde" itself.
By this separation, it is easy to make onself believe that there is no
connection among things such as poetic and military productions which share
the same technolgoies and often very simlar methods of "composition."

In the "New Extreme Experimental " works I write of, invented, imagined and
actual also, I make use of "real events" and examples along with my own
inventions and terms from poetry and literature to restore a connection
between these two--the military and artistic avant-garde.  My point is that
a great deal of what happens today, is kept separated, so that the right
hand is to not admit to what the left hand is doing. My enquiry is to look
into the ways in which every aspect of a society is part of its overall
system, rather than being discrete parts from which one may pretend to
detach oneself from those one refuses to acknowledge, while championing
those that one does.

The project I am working on has at its very heart Freedom, and investigating
how it is threatened, and how often what in one area is seen as a thing of
"freedom and fancy" can as easily function in the overlapping area in the
same society for uses which deny any freedom and fancy.

I have cited the quote before, but repeat it as it provides one of the keys
to my project:

In the first lines of his Introduction to Torture: Cancer of Democracy
France and Algeria 1954-62, Pierre Vidal-Naquet asks "Can a great nation,
liberal by tradition, allows its institutions, its army, and its system of
justice to degenerate over the span of a few years as a result of the use of
torture, and by its concealment and deception of such a vital issue call the
whole Western concept of human dignity and the rights of the individual into
question?"

I think that by extending the terms and tropes of poetry and literature
beyond their own area and into those of the political and military, and vice
versa, by investigating their ways of being used to create this new form of
poetry which I invent and imagine, and discover as I go along, , I am
creating an ongoing "panorama" as it were of a literature which exists and
is hidden in plain site/sight/cite as there is a refusal for the most part
to make any connections among any of these events in the world and events on
the page or in virtuality.

That is, that for most part, the society practices a deliberate
self-deception which qucikly calcifies into a recieved wisdom, and makes it
nearly taboo to question any of its practices and assertions and theories,
as these themselves are the outgrowths of an inital self-deception.

I am working with the Fake that  already exists, and the Real that is Faked,
as well as with information from many sources, texts, and yes, lists,
anthologies, compendiums, the Internet and the library and the daily news in
all different media, and using with these works from poetry and writing,
cinema and painting, to create a work that is both imaginative and critical,
a critique and and an investigation and into enquiry into "findings."

These writings are supplemented by the ongoing series of stories featuring
the character called "El Colonel," which go much further into the "literary"
realms of many of these questions and turn into themselves investigations of
the :"literary" and many questions of "conceptual" literature and the like.

All of these actualites are the source for fictions, as are all the fictions
and fakes sources for many actually occurring events.

I am not al denying the "freedom and fancy" of this particular project, but
extending it much further, that is, I have been before it came along already
going much further in many of these areas.  I think that the
misunderstanding and rejection of what I am writing is that it proposes  a
different approach in which one is taking theory and using it with things
that are actually occuring in the world and examining these in terms of the
languages they employ in order to present themselves.

In a sense, a convention of the "seperated" avant-garde today is to use
words very often as if they have no meanings and consequences.  This is fine
if it is limited to a predefined area, yet once out of there, everything
changes swfitly and who controls meanings and who performs consequnces
becomes quite another matter to say the least.

Again, part of the fear in your criticism of my ideas is that perhaps I
suggest underatking a much different investigation into the nature of what
is meant by "language experiments," and "experimental writing," that is, I
propose extending what is understood as writing and as experiment on a
vaster scale and sphere of action than one perhaps more limited to the
areana of "language games."  It is not even that I propose any such
thing--it already exists all around one, and in order to understand it, one
needs to accept that all kinds of workers in language exist as well as poets
and writers, and that all of these may be engaged in their own various ways
on projects which might be approached more "subversively" so to speak by
using some of the methods and terms of poetic and literary theory, not for
creating further abstractions and theories, but for creating works of
imagination and imaginative critique which help make visible those things
which are either concealed or deliberately overlooked, go unseen on purpose
in a society such as the US is today.

In a sense, for myself, when you mock such ideas, all it does is exhibit
that you have a belief in and support of the status quo.  That's fine with
me if you choose this route, all I ask is that you respect my right to
follow mine.

I think that with the Anthology what you are defending is a kind of
conventional idea of the "freedom of the web."   Due to its manner of
presentation, for you, there occurs in the Anthology the feat of separation,
in which it is agreed that in some areas, any kind of intrusion of such
things as the disinformation, surveillance, coercive, constraining,
capturing aspects of the Internet are denied in favor of only the "fun"
aspects.  And the same with separating the idea of Anthology from a gallows
humor in which it is proposed that some jailer might look about at the cells
of detainees and say--ah!! my Anthology of the faces and persons and words
of terrorists!"

And, after all, are there not the Poems from Guantanamo anthology, or the
writings of Roberto Bolano about poetry and Chile's fascist era under
Pincohet among a great many others in which these things are seen as united?
That is, that poetry and torture are not seperated, but part of the same
system, co-existing? And that even within that system, some forms of
"freedom and fancy" are allowed, while, of course, several others are not.

Until very recently, there has been very little in the American arts and
writing that has examined at all what the open use of torture by this
society means, in the sense that Vida-Naquet is writing of.  What are the
effects and behaviours of the language itself of a society which makes use
of torture, which supports Apartheid, which is genociding the Iraqi people,
which is threatening to continue to widen the scope of Wars which are
annihilating its own economy and people?  How does such a society remain so
quiet in so many areas about what it is doing and what is happening to it?
Why the kinds of taboos which Vidla-Naquet observed in France, a nation
which had only recently had its own citizens tortured while being Occupied?

Why is it that you accuse me of "denying the freedom and fancy" of an
Anthology when I haven't at all done this, but think of it  as a part of a
vast parade of projects investigating similar aspects of some of the much
larger overlapping areas I propose to examine?  Why do you say that project
has "freedom and fancy" and in a sense deny mine this, and mock it with
allusions that are distasteful to yourself?

Is this its own form of a "Homeland Security," conducted in order to protect
said Security from too many questions, ideas, imaginings, findings?  Does
this mean that only a few persons are allowed to have dominion over what is
considered to be "aceptable practice" within a confined realm of writing?
And is not that in a sense constructing its own small sytem of prisons or
gulags or exiles for that particualr aspect of writing?  If one is not
allowed to question or have a different "take" or come up with "alternative
ideas"----then how much freedom and fancy is there really being allowed to
happen?

If one is truly concerned about Freedom, is it not necessary to go beyond
the happy faces of the received ideas and conformism-by-consensus
acceptances of what constitutes projects which are "good, healthy examples"
of "freedom and fancy" and question how it is that those same methods that
create happy faces can be used to create torture cells?  Is the web so
"free" as one is continually being told, so much a vast gateway to the
wondrous new experimental poetries of the future, riding a wave of hyper
texts into a spectacular simulated sunset?

Or is it not also a tool which may be used to assemble information, create
disinformation and target anyone and everyone in some way that is useful to
the ends of someone else, whether it is Amazon keeping track of its
"preferred customers' interests," or a covert operation tracking the daily
shopping routes of a young mother suspected to be purchasing chemicals at
the store along with the baby formula, chemicals that someone claims are
going to be used for a suspected or framed up plot to incinerate some gated
community, some private plane, some local Mosque?

Right now, people are detained and being readied for trials in Minnesota as
"terrorists"--and their act of "terrorism?"  Demonstrating at the Republican
National Convention.  Under al the new laws passed in such a hurry and
subtly attached as small riders to much larger pork barrels through the
years since the First Patriot Act, it is now possible to try people for
things no one would ever have thought possible, and to punish them for
these, too.

The State makes use of the threats of "terrorism" to cerate its own Terror,
a Terror which it calls for "one's own good," Security.    One of the
functions of Security in a sense is to perform the kind of operation one
does in separating what is a project that is full of "freedom and fancy"
from one that is full of the kinds of things I write of.

Ironically, your not understanding my project misses the point that my
project is all about there being the Freedom for works of "freedom and
fancy" to continue to exist.

I write out of personal experience with many of things I present, as well as
with imagination and invention, and a continual research into the
information, history, backgrounds and literatures of the subjects I make use
of.

At one level there are "language games."  At another level are the areas
where language is weaponry, manipulation, propaganda, deception,
provocation, control, and also torture, life and death.

Both need to be thought, and not separately,as you are advocating, but as
two sides of the same coin.

It's saddening that you don't understand my project, and that in a sense
advocate a conventional wisdom which is to "play it safe" as it were by
playing "language games" and not investigating any further what language,
technology and their consequences may be, beyond the realm of language
games.  If there is to be freedom and fancy, why not think of how this is
existing because some are concerned about the freedom in the world to
actually be able to create Anthologies of this sort?

In a sense, what you are saying is that, as in George Orwell's Animal Farm,
"all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others."  That is, one
idea of Anthologies is Good, and any investigations of my sort are Bad.
Therefore, "freedom and fancy" are considered the "pastures of plenty" for
some, and for others--get rid of them, pay no attention, etc.

Or, perhaps, there is a line being drawn between allowing "fancy" but not
Imagination?

How does one in fact legislate Imagination?  One method you used already is
to mock it, and say it is a threat to "freedom and fancy."  In an implicit
sense is this not saying figuratively--lock that guy up!  Shut him up! Or
simply--don't listen, it is too far out there to be considered.

Which is precisely one of the points I am trying to make, that things
considered "too far out there" are already happening, and that too little
note is being taken of them at all.  One may delude oneself with freedom and
fancy and at the same time have freedom like an old rug be pulled out from
underneath one without even noticing, so rapt is one in the delusions, or
the distractions, the entertainments as it were.  You see?  Without fighting
for the old rug of Freedom, there isn't going to always be "freedom and
fancy" to play with, if some have their way.

And what, after all, is not "enhanced interrogation" but an "experiment in
language, in the body of the text, in the production of language out of the
body--"

The same electricity running the computers for our conversation is powering
the wires which are used to torture someone somewhere during this very same
time--
Have you ever seen the convulsive dance of the "Body Electric?"--

Just imagine the day when such interrogation can be conducted via
computers--directions given from a modem in a city thousands of miles from
the on-screen prisoner--
and a jolly party of invited guests having some wine and cheese and
discussing the aesthetico-linguistic mastery of the keyboard torturer's
control and manipulation of the "Body Electric" as it dances and sings and
spouts sound poetry for the benefit of the acute and enlightened art
theorists and critics, the literary theorists present, and the poets who see
before them the Theater of the future, a new form of Puppet Theater!  The
Marionette wires being those carrying electrodes attached to different
pressure points and tender spots, and making the movements of the gesturing
puppet before them seem oh so very lifelike, and at the same time so puppet
like!! As it dances its way along the paths of the Dance of Death.


You see, there is literally a "connection" which "runs through" all these
things even as we converse-!

I hope that you may understand that my project is not at all what you think
it is.

I often wonder if what I write is understood or not, if it is even noticed
to begin with, and, if often it is very hard to be understood becuase all
the training that one is gievn is to not believe in the things I write of,
even when one may give al the examples of it happening in front of people
everyday.

The problem is that those things one believes in, is trained al one's life
in a society to believe in, do not exist--the soceity long since has
dispensed with them.  They may exist symbolically, and in language, and as
things people trumpet about and convince themselves are the foundations of
their thought--and al of this is manipulated by those who would like one to
continue to believe in all of this.

If in order to believe in it, one has to steadily readjust onself through
time to the ever shifting meanings of words as they make room for ever more
things thought impossible in the system before--since one has fought to make
a place in that society, one goes along with it.

Yet all the same, the gap between what words are saying and what they are
doing grows larger and larger.

The greater the gaps are, the harder it is to "connect the words and
actions"--such as simply re-connecting the military and artistic meaning of
"avant-garde" in order to findout what this may lead to, and to help in
understanding why the avant-garde functions quite differently once it has
abandoned that early connection, which Italian Futurism embraced and Dada
was so "violently" opposed to

The great and tawdry paradox of the pseudo-hoaxy "fake anthology" is that
while the project wants to make a cynical and, yes, misanthropic statement
against human-only poetry in order, it seems, to say "if a machine can do it,
then poetry is dismissed as an endeavor" (I'm 99% certain this is the primary
intent of the project) it, the project, must LEGITIMiZE ITSELF by pretending to be
human!?

In that, the whole project feels like a sham on the face of it.  Let alone that fact
that the "sophisticated algorithm" does nothing that hasn't been done already
by poetry-generating programs dating from the 1970s (Racter, for one) and
even earlier. It's not at all that difficult to get a computer to spew out free verse
using source texts based on some form of Markov Chain or other stochastic
logic, nor is it that difficult, in the open field that is poetry, to hit upon a few
machine-assisted poems that read, in style, like poetry written by mere
humans.  Joshua Kotin wrote a trim essay a few years back on this very subject:
what are the implications of a poetic "style" if a computer can successfully
mimic that style?

So, yes, machine assisted poetry raises very interesting questions about poetic
origin, readership, authorship, &c but without the need for clap-trap one-
upmanship (one-upmachineship??) and thumbing one's nose at human-only
poetries.

Let machine poetry be machine poetry!  Let computer-assisted poetry be just
that--another tool in the procedural verse tool box.  It's a shame to reduce
machine-assisted poetry to the level of a bad joke.

Also--can anyone else use this software?  Can we see the code?

Hi Luke,

I didn't turn on to poetry until I was in my first year of college.=A0 I ha=
d begun to write short stories during my senior year of high school, and be=
fore that, years of being exposed to "accessible poetry" bored me.=A0 That =
sort of poetry didn't register much, except to scare me in a class because =
my southern ear couldn't count meter "correctly" in a more northerly classr=
oom.=A0 I wonder if you might be doing students an injustice -- the one tha=
t so many high school teachers perpetuate every year -- by limiting this li=
st to whatever you count as accessible.=A0 Here, I imagine the type of poet=
ry which allows for simple, usually morally-driven meanings such as Frost's=
 roads and fences or the few fun 'obvious' Dickinson poems anthologized ad =
nauseum.=A0=20

These kinds of poems deliver college students up who yawn at the thought of=
 poetry or are ready to run because they too have been taught the tangibles=
 such as counting meter and identifying smilies versus metaphors and kinds =
of rhymes.=A0 And they really loathe the abstract morals such poems drive h=
ome, only a little more than the story books that told them to share and be=
 kind, etc.=A0 Nothing wrong with those lessons, but I fear poetry is not t=
he medium for reduction and easy pleasing/teaching.=A0 We also do poetry an=
 injustice and the young people being introduced to it by pretending it is =
all simple and fun - kind of like raising suspicions that there's some evil=
 medicine within the spoonful of sugar we're trying to get them to swallow.=
=A0 And I think there may be in that particular spoonful.=A0=20

Good luck with the list,

Amy

Thanks everyone. I very much appreciate your suggestions and comments. You =
may
be interested to know that this list isn't just a pet project. It will be a
sublist in a much more comprehensive literature booklist that is currently =
being
produced/put together by a reading institute that I work for ( Also, which =
is
neither here nor there, in teach a few writing/lit. classes a semester at t=

local university). The booklist is intended to be utilized by adults who wo=
uld
like some guidance in advancing their education and reading. Originally the
booklist wasn't going to have a poetry section, but I successfully argued
that, given exposure to rich, meaningful, accessible poetry, there is as mu=
ch
likelihood as not that the newly engaged reader might spend at least some t=
ime
reading poetry as part of their daily (weekly?) reading diet. You can see t=

Well, let's see, I'm 1) not a nationalist, 2) not a socialist, so it would be impossible for me to be a fascist. The only inflexibility to thought I have encountered have been from the Left, whose thoughts have certainly fossilized over the years. Of course, that is because of their strong aversion to poetry, as demonstrated by the "poets" on the postmodern Left (which in fact has ITs roots in fascism and Marxism both). Being flexible doesn't mean believing anything yur Leftist professors threw at you in school, nor is it believing just anything any everything. Open-mindedness and being willing to change your mind based on a change in your knowledge of the facts, yes; being so open-minded your brain falls out so that you'll fall for anything, no.

Dear Troy Camplin,

Interdisciplinarian or no, I think you might be in the wrong place - I sense
there are no converted to preach to here - which is what you seem to be
attempting. I imagined that an interdisciplinarian would have demonstrated
more flexibility of thought and certainly no traces of allegiance to
fascism. Hey anyway, I thought this was a forum for poetry and not politics,
(I know, poetry without politics is a paradox - but politics without poetry
is the fossilization of culture!) so I take back what I said.

Luke,

While I became obsessed with poetry earlier in my life than Amy, I had
a similar experience. On the whole, "accessible" poetry pushed me away
from a genre that was beginning to pique my interest and "difficult"
poetry that drew me in.

A book like Tender Buttons excited me because it didn't ask me to
decode the poem and reduce it to a pithy message, an impoverishing
experience that makes so many high school English student run from all
writing, but it asked me to simply read the words on the page, to
experience them, and to intuitively respond to them: I had finally
found a poetry that asked me to enjoy the reading of poetry.

I understand that my experience might not be typical, but please
consider putting "difficult" writers like Stein, Jack Spicer (is he
considered "difficult"?), and John Yau (whose humor can be a real
draw) on your list.

But as far as the sort of poets for whom you originally asked, I
haven't heard Helen Adam mentioned yet. Her poems often relate to folk
murder ballads in a way that can easily be called fun.

Also, I'm not sure if James Schuyler has been mentioned. His poems
have are intoxicatingly lush (beautiful vowels, colors, the feel of
the daydream), and his lyric usually has an easily identifiable
subject or narrative.

And how about Joseph Ceravolo? His lyricism might feel a tad hermetic
to some readers, but so many younger poets, including myself, are
drawn to this too often overlooked poet that you might consider him as
a poet who speaks to our moment.

I hope this helps,

Andy

Whew, first I hardly support the status quo; second I wasn't mocking your
ideas; third I appreciate your reply; fourth you should be aware of my
work at least to the extent of knowing it deals precisely with larger
contextualizations, not just political or philosophical (which in fact is
one of the reasons most of my posts aren't accepted here); fifth, I don't
know what 'freedom of the web is' - when I've taught the net etc. I've
gone over the territory you describe in detail but - in relation to this
anthology, I find the approach heavy-handed, your agenda - which I largely
agree with - crushing the work/s as thing/s in itself/themselves, in other
words looking at the work and giving it room to breathe. And what happens
too often on this list is a hypostatization of the preciousness of the
proper name, as if all kinds were natural, so that any possibility of
celebrating what might be seen as alternative communities and their
inhering even in these dark times is lost, which makes the times darker. I
think of alternative universes or discourses of poetry/poetics in which
these very names might be attached to all sorts of writings, and while
some people have pointed to identity theft, this is hardly the case any
more than if I call a name on the street for proper or mistaken identity,
that is no one will take the "Alan Sondheim" poem for my work for example
who has ever read either my work or any of the other works in the
anthology. It's interesting and depressing that you and Catherine I think
both bring up torture as if there's a theoretical lineage between the
antghology and that sort of violence and again, I see these lineages as
suspect in the same way as Ayers/Obama is suspect, yes, but for example,
although I may be guilty of misreading. So from Issue I and relatiely
innocuous generated poetry to torture for me is problematic. You mention
language games; I have no interest in them and never had, nor have I had
interest in language poetry, just to set the record straight.

I'm not doubting your project or your personal experience, I hope any more
than you're doubting mine. But I think when [x] whatever comes along it
doesn't have to fit into either your worldview or ideas or mine and that
maybe the best approach is not to do that, not that I have any real say or
taste in the matter. I do read a great deal of what you write, including
this long piece, which I appreciate - I can't write that much or reply to
the whole thing unfortunately - I just think in this case the relation of
torture etc. to this is misguided and certainly takes the joy and wonder
out of reading such an anthology, although "such an" is meaningless since
this was the first at least to create such a commotion on the list. Now
Yasusada did, but Johnson was pushing the political there as well as the
proper name and a phenomenology of authenticity, for me Adorno comes to
mind, but this is different, and for me one of the major aesthetic
categories - if not the major one - and again I'm speaking only for myself
- is wonder, and wonder appears in the sense that Merleau-Ponty speaks of
Cezanne - James Elroy uses the term as well in a similar sense - and this
moves me, and the anthology moves me, and I think moving in the direction
of torture (which can be done with anything or anyone, this movement and
that is a problem of function and/or structure) just, for me takes the joy
out of the thing, and I want that. This doesn't mean I'm not political or
politically active, but that I worry about seeing the world always through
the same lens, which is what it would mean for me. - Alan

attributing the ideas of the opposition soley to the mindless acceptance of dogma (an epistemology that knows no political allegiance) rather than accepting that reasonable people can differ greatly on fundamental principles of politics and economics is the root cause of close-mindedness. without taking opposing viewpoints seriously, which clearly you do not given both your dismissal of the opposition as worthy of the title and your obvious ignorance of the arguments in favor of progressive democratic principles, a claim to open mindedness is absurd.

I am pointing this out to you not because I want to insult you, although I grant that saying this about someone is insulting, but because i don't think you realize quite how absurd your claims are and would like to give you the benefit of the doubt that you would like to avoid such errors in the future.

I would also like to point out that what you may not also realize is that your incendiary behavior and ocmments may have the opposite effect that you intend. In my own case, i found myself a center left classical liberal driven to the left looking for political allegiance thanks to the ignorance and tactical foulplay that's come from the right over the last ten to fifteen years. In other words, the kind of absurdity on display in your attitudes sir are precisely the sort of thing that radicalized me. it had nothing to do with my college professors.

I haven't been following the fake anthology thread. missed the first dozen
emails, picking up the thread thereafter didn't make much sense. a poet
friend (not fake) from outside the listserv called today to talk about this
unique project. he said - you are there. curiously amused I took my first
peek at it. well.....funny. the fakeness seems to have logical cracks in it,
at least one. I have two poems in it, not one. and my name shows up twice.
first with my Bengali last name - Mukhopadhyay and then with the English,
Mukherjee. I wonder if that was bad oversight or the editors knew I was a
bilingual writer.....

has this happened to anyone else ? showing up twice ?

Only when people demonstrably ignore facts do I accuse people of mindlessly accepting dogma. Marxism is a secular religion and hermeneutic circle and, thus dogmatic. I do accept the fact that reasonable people can differ greatly on how they interpret the facts -- but reasonable people do not shut themselves off from the facts. I do enjoy reasonable discussions with reasonable people.

My arguments are not anti-democratic, as you imply. Democracy, too, is a spontaneous order -- but of a different kind. Nor are my arguments from the Right. I have as little use for the thoughtless ideology of the Right as I do for that of the Left. I am interested in facts, when it comes to economics. Ideas belong to the realm of politics and philosophy. If you want to discuss ideas, we can move the discussion into those arenas.

And why is it that my behavior is "incendiary," but all those on the Left who have been attacking me aren't? It seems to me that the only way you can even begin to think they haven't been incendiary is because you side with them. Please note, though, that up to this point, I haven't yet complained about such irrational tactics.

attributing the ideas of the opposition soley to the mindless acceptance of dogma (an epistemology that knows no political allegiance) rather than accepting that reasonable people can differ greatly on fundamental principles of politics and economics is the root cause of close-mindedness. without taking opposing viewpoints seriously, which clearly you do not given both your dismissal of the opposition as worthy of the title and your obvious ignorance of the arguments in favor of progressive democratic principles, a claim to open mindedness is absurd.

I am pointing this out to you not because I want to insult you, although I grant that saying this about someone is insulting, but because i don't think you realize quite how absurd your claims are and would like to give you the benefit of the doubt that you would like to avoid such errors in the future.

I would also like to point out that what you may not also realize is that your incendiary behavior and ocmments may have the opposite effect that you intend. In my own case, i found myself a center left classical liberal driven to the left looking for political allegiance thanks to the ignorance and tactical foulplay that's come from the right over the last ten to fifteen years. In other words, the kind of absurdity on display in your attitudes sir are precisely the sort of thing that radicalized me. it had nothing to do with my college professors.

I haven't been following the fake anthology thread. missed the first dozen
emails, picking up the thread thereafter didn't make much sense. a poet
friend (not fake) from outside the listserv called today to talk about this
unique project. he said - you are there. curiously amused I took my first
peek at it. well.....funny. the fakeness seems to have logical cracks in it,
at least one. I have two poems in it, not one. and my name shows up twice.
first with my Bengali last name - Mukhopadhyay and then with the English,
Mukherjee. I wonder if that was bad oversight or the editors knew I was a
bilingual writer.....

has this happened to anyone else ? showing up twice ?

wow.

anyone who does the sort of work jim carpenter does will have more or less
constant occassion to realize how much fear there is of his sort of work.
fear from artists. but also a more widespread contemporary fear of machines
being made to do human things.

fear of being replaced. fear of our humanity being diminished; fear of
humanity being diminished. fear of poetry being diminished; fear of poets
being diminished. fear of the life being squeezed out of things into
mediocre mechanized processes accepted as replacements for what is beautiful
and lively.

one cannot scoff at these fears.

there is a long way to go concerning the dissemination of a more capacious
vision of the possible roles of computers and software in society and art.

and that is precisely one of the things work such as jim's is concerned
with. it raises these questions even when the poems themselves may not
address this sort of issue. which is one of the reasons it also needs
steve's sort of work of considering a frame and a concept for jim's work.

anyone who spends the sort of time jim has to program his software--count
upon it--is seriously interested in poetry both as a fully human undertaking
and also, of course, interested in the degree to which poetry is mechanical.
when we really understand that, that's when we'll know what is essentially
human about it.

it isn't about trying to fool people into believing what was written by a
computer was written by a person. it's about trying to explore the
difference as poetically, dramatically, and thoughtfully as possible.

one emotion, though, that i imagine would be relatively easy to program into
software: fear and its predictable responses.

Your behavior is incendiary because you make statements like: "Being
flexible doesn't mean believing anything yur Leftist professors threw
at you in school" and "The only inflexibility to thought I have
encountered have been from the Left" those are very broad, very
unqualified statements which attack large swaths of the subscribers
to this mailing list which i think most anyone would acknowledge has
a primarily left leaning demographic.

i would quibble that your support of open markets and what appear to
me to be largely libertarian sympathies are in fact right wing
positions. but i'm not particularly interested in those sorts of
conversations. what i would say is that the economic and political
view that you appear to support is one that to me appears to be every
bit as sectarian as the brands of marxism you appear to be talking
about, which, and please correct me if i'm wrong, seem to be limited
to only extremist views like marxist/leninism and maoism.

there are interesting ideas to be found in marxism, and while i don't
consider myself a marxist I do think that you're doing the same thing
you accuse leftists of by painting marxism with so broad a brush.

of course, this whole conversation ignores the real differences
between the political economic philosophies of social democracy,
socialism, communism, and marxism. and of course, one does not need
to be any of those things to make an intelligent critique of
monetarist/milton friedman style laissez faire capitalism. The term
"free market fundamentalist" was coined by Joseph Stiglitz, who is a
neo-Keynesian, and like it are not Keynes and his descendents are
also capitalists. George Soros additionally makes a strong critique
of the laissez faire in favor of strong mixed economies, and my guess
is that you and he probably agree on an awful lot.

if i've misunderstood or misconstrued your positions at all, i
apologize for that. i simply wanted to point out that there appeared
to be a disconnect between the style of your rhetoric and its
content, as there was what appeared to me to be a contradiction
between your criticism of your opposition and the manner in which
that criticism was offered. a certain kind of postmodern read could
be taken of your statements that implied that everything you've
written is in fact ironic.

there are elements of that in Plato's republic as well, though, so
even if i'm right you're in pretty good company.

The flaws, in my flawed opinion, bring Issue 1 closer to the realm of human
work. What I mean is that computers can't make mistakes: they can break down
and have errors, but the software does only what it is told to do. With
perfection's even surface, it would be more identifiably the work of a
computer. Its computerized approaches to perfection accounts for the
blandness I have found to be characteristic of the work as a whole. (Where
are the exceptions?)

The growth of computer poetry should lead to a greater celebration of
mistakes if we wish to banish fears of replacement, though we must always
strive to err in greater less predictable ways if we wish to stay ahead of
algorithms. But then, I have long held to the belief that it is the
intriguing flaw--the departure from one's stated poetics, the line the poet
can't quite explain, the divergence from grammar or syntax with powerful
effect--that gives a poem its greatness for however long that subjective
stature can last. This connects, of course, to aspects of wabi-sabi, though
outright simplicity is more of something to be striven for than something to
achieve in my ideal (subjective) poetics.

eric and others,

jim carpenter, who authored the software that created the poems used in the
issue 1 anthology, is very clear about his intentions, the availability of
the code, demonstrations of the parameters under which it can be run, etc.
here:

http://etc.wharton.upenn.edu:8080/Etc3beta/Erika.jsp

note also that stephen mclaughlin, who compiled the list of names and added
them to the poems compiled by carpenter's software, like had intentions
other than (or at least not 100% consistent with) those of carpenter.

allbests,

Then why submit poems composed by his software, like Carpenter has done, to
journals without mentioning the fact that a computer assisted in the poem's
composition if not to try and perpetrate, at least in part, a sort of hoax hinging
on the fact that people (editors in particular) were "fooled"?  This action also
seems to fly in the face of exploring "difference," no?

All I was saying is that computer poetry can raise all the kinds of questions and
make the kind of explorations you mention without all the folderol.

I think you also mistook annoyance for fear--yes, many people do not like the
idea of machines "encroaching" into what they consider a purely human
endeavor, but I have no such fear.  Machines can do things in poetry humans
can not or dare not, but humans can also do things a machine can not be
programmed (as yet) to do.

From the outside, looking through the lens of the actions Carpenter has taken
with his software, I think it's fair to think that there's something snarky lurking
within...

Dear Alan:

I don't think that the discussion means that "the right has won," at all.
Perhpas some might see the creators of the programme producing the Anthology
as "the Right" as it is intended as an anti-experimental example; that is,
that a computer program can produce peoms just as intersting as any given
set of "experimental" as well as dead poets.

The anaology with terorism is not to say at all that the anhtology is
terrorist, or even terrifying.  For you it brought a sense of wonder, and
wonder is something the world is ever in good need of.

I think that --well, I know in my case, what intersts me and brings a sense
of wonder is how many things have a doubled, punning nature, are two edged
swords.  On the one hand a method may produce an anthology of poems; on the
other hand the same method may be used to fill a prison with "suspects"
complete with the "evidence" from an "unidentified source."

Personally, I don't think there is a "terrorist" aspect to the project in
itself,; rather, like many hoaxes, it is intended to expose an aspect of
something whith which the authors are in disagreement, or are crritical of,
or simply laughing at.

The real Terror is when the State uses forged documents and faked evidence
to begin genocidal Wars as the US State has in Iraq.  The use of lies to
mureder milions and destroy an entire society and culture--well, the US has
done this before, right "at home," it is only that the technology used has
changed.

Barry has a very good point.  I don't know if anyone here--I am sure many
probably have!--has run into someone they know who is a hard core Dead Head,
and has just acquired about a hundred new bootleg tapes and CDs of Dead
shows from various tours that they immmediately kindap you and hold you
hostage until you have gone with "on the journey" for many long long long
hours, far longer than one can bear, if one were not a captive audeince so
to speak.

When you have heard about fifty different versions of the same song which
are being played amazingly almost exactly the same--even the "jams" after
awhile are incredibly similar--the non Dead Head is bewildered by the
endurance for montony and self-consistence which one's Dead Head friend
has.  yet al the while, the Dead head will point out some very tiny
difference, some slightly different vibration in the Cosmic groove--as
though this is a Revelation from the
Mighty Source itself.

I've been passionate about some artists in the same manner, and listened to
every single creaky old vinyl, every bootleg, every cassette recorded radio
show, of some one whose music I was manic about--and within the same song
performed a different time heard entire symphonies of difference, where
others might not distinguish anything much other than a variation in the
degree of the quality of the recording from good to barely non-noise sounds.


I also used to collect versions of the smae song done by as many artists as
I could find, especially obscure Punk gargae band versions of massively
covered songs.  One might hear five or six bands in a row that sounded
almost identical, trying their hardest to sound note for note like the
Yardbirds, say.  Then would come some explosion and a suddenly completely
different version, so different that in effect it was a completely new song.

(In Jamaica, when an artist cut a cover, they called it simply "Version.")

As an auctioneer in Vermont my brother and I were fans of said once, when
selling "a real special pair of tires,"--"what makes these tires so special,
you see, is that one's the same and the other's different."

And they sold at quite a good price!

Lists of names with affixed "crimes" have been produced throughout history
to send persons to prison or beheadings, the gallows or simply to vanish
into the Blacklist oblivions.  It is simply that now with computers having
at their disposal such massive lists of names and amounts of information--as
well as disinformation--one could indeed compile both an Anthology of poetry
as well as a list of suspects to be "detaineed indefinietly."

The wonder to me is how different--or even the same-- persons, taking the
same method, may see quite different methods of employing it.

After all, not that long after the invention of writing in ancient Iraq--the
first forgeries also began to appear.

Considering what has happened to Iraq based on forgeries--
one may ask, is that thanks there is for the invention of writing?--

As though writing itself is to pen a Pandora's Box!--

Content-type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"

Ted Greenwald's 30th book, In Your Dreams, new from BlazeVox.

Ted Greenwald=B9s 30th book consists of 79 72-line poems, each with his
trademark recombinatory drop-stitch weave. As a basic pattern, which is
varied, each poem=B9s 26 demotic lines is repeated in 9 interlinked free
triolets (ABCACDABDEFDFGDE). In Your Dreams is almost, then is, hard to say=
,
In Your Dreams is almost, hard to say, autopoiesis, In Your Dreams is
almost, then is, autopoiesis, flickering fugal strobe of the everyday, or
sublime sonic moir=E9, autopoiesis, or sublime sonic moir=E9, spoken and
shimmering, autopoiesis, flickering fugal strobe of the everyday.
=8BCharles Bernstein=20

In your dreams, text messages are cinematic connectives; in the rushes of
Ted Greenwald=B9s talking pictures, a spoken grammar steps out of the voice
and into language proper, only to find that the comma is an extra (Natalie
Wood plays the waitress=B9s pad; Laurence Harvey, the double helix). Shots an=
d
cuts are balanced for maximum clarity and accommodation. What happens next
is in the present tense.
=8BMiles Champion=20

As the centered layout replicates a spinal column or double helix of
symmetrical verticality that allows the eye to scan rapidly down through
each stack of lines, the use of interwoven repetition creates an echoic
choral effect that builds-in rhythmic intensity: In Your Dreams. Two steps
forward, one step back, these improvised speeches for an in-town head
reverberate with second, third and fourth takes that take out loans on
short-term memory only to break the bank of thought-heard voices and walk
right through the door in a hum.
=8BKit Robinson=20

The poems to be found in this extraordinary book exert obsessive
fascination, and they do so on numerous fronts. The title, In Your Dreams,
suggests that this is a dream book; it is important to note, however, that
the dreams are not materials of Ted Greenwald=B9s inward musings. They are
propelled outward, rather, to =B3your dreams,=B2 which is to say ours=8Bwe of the
shared, not-so-nice realities of the contemporary world. It is also
important to note the affective import of the title: it is witty and
slightly melancholy and caustic and confrontational. The poems reflect not
some dreamy inner consciousness but on-going social processes with their
intricate (and some might say relentless) patterns. Patterning is
perceptible in the structure of the poems, and that is a manifest source of
the technical fascination they yield. Indeed, Greenwald has produced a
masterpiece of the American variable foot. But the emotional power of this
utterly compelling book emerges from the inter-personal conditions that giv=
e
the poems their thrust. The poems speak in and out of love, irritation,
tension, wry amiability, nervous and unnerving intimacy; they represent
daily interplay, quotidian perseverations; they resonate with comic
intensity and the blues. That=B9s it: they are beautiful and very bluesy.

Let me clarify, then. I oppose the following economic systems: marxism, socialism, fascism, Keyneseanism, capitalism (as defined by Marx, who coined the term), and interventionism by any name. All of these are man-designed systems or man-interventionary systems. I support naturally-occurring spontaneous order economies. That's not a right-wing position, as the political Right is not pro-market (Pat Buchanan once said "I oppose the free market."). If you consider Bush to be a member of the Right, then the recent activities of him in regards to the economy should belie any support of the free market, as he has done nothing but undermine it. The most recent evidence: the suggestion that the federal government partially nationalize the banks. That's not pro free markets by any stretch of the imagination. That's the kind of things you would expect from Hugo Chavez.

I'm not saying there aren't good ideas in Marx. I take good ideas wherever they come from. But if one is to take the overall political ideology of Marxism, I do oppose it. The contemporary Left is primarily Marxist, though of course the Left historically had its origins in the French Revolution. Still, the secular  egalitarianist ideals are still to be found there. The Right also had its origins in the French Revolution -- they were the religious royalists. Neither side were friends of the free market. At the time "liberals" were those who, like me, supported the free market, supported representational democracy, supported science, and supported free expression in the arts and in life. Over time, the Left began to take on support of democracy, seeing it as a way of achieving their goals through the manipulation of the populace. Science was making such progress that some began to argue that we could create a "scientific society," which is where socialism
 had its foundation. The technocrats believed that we could learn all there is to know about the physical world, therefore we could learn everything about how an economy runs, and we could therefore learn how to design an economy so that it was perfectly efficient and everyone was treated equally. The science of the time showed them that, though what we have since learned from systems science is that such a dream is impossible. Still, you hear it in political rhetoric all the time with promises to "make things more efficient." Science has left the Left far behind. The response? To adopt an anti-science postmodernist world view. Which is where we are now at politically in the U.S. In Europe, they are still trying to fit systems science into Marxism, which requires them ignoring what systems science says about systems, particularly self-organization. Other problems occur when they don't differentiate between entities and environments.

Other things that don't place me anywhere near the Right: my strong support for gay rights, including state recognition of gay marriage, my support for equal rights and protections under the law, my opposition to the government being involved in private life, my support for drug legalization and for legalizing prostitution and gambling, and my support for transparency in government and economy. My cosmology is big bang cosmology and emergent complexity, and I take an evolutionary perspective on most things. Of course, much of this puts me in direct opposition to many on the Left in the U.S. as well.

Your behavior is incendiary because you make statements like: "Being
flexible doesn't mean believing anything yur Leftist professors threw
at you in school" and "The only inflexibility to thought I have
encountered have been from the Left" those are very broad, very
unqualified statements which attack large swaths of the subscribers
to this mailing list which i think most anyone would acknowledge has
a primarily left leaning demographic.

i would quibble that your support of open markets and what appear to
me to be largely libertarian sympathies are in fact right wing
positions. but i'm not particularly interested in those sorts of
conversations. what i would say is that the economic and political
view that you appear to support is one that to me appears to be every
bit as sectarian as the brands of marxism you appear to be talking
about, which, and please correct me if i'm wrong, seem to be limited
to only extremist views like marxist/leninism and maoism.

there are interesting ideas to be found in marxism, and while i don't
consider myself a marxist I do think that you're doing the same thing
you accuse leftists of by painting marxism with so broad a brush.

of course, this whole conversation ignores the real differences
between the political economic philosophies of social democracy,
socialism, communism, and marxism. and of course, one does not need
to be any of those things to make an intelligent critique of
monetarist/milton friedman style laissez faire capitalism. The term
"free market fundamentalist" was coined by Joseph Stiglitz, who is a
neo-Keynesian, and like it are not Keynes and his descendents are
also capitalists. George Soros additionally makes a strong critique
of the laissez faire in favor of strong mixed economies, and my guess
is that you and he probably agree on an awful lot.

if i've misunderstood or misconstrued your positions at all, i
apologize for that. i simply wanted to point out that there appeared
to be a disconnect between the style of your rhetoric and its
content, as there was what appeared to me to be a contradiction
between your criticism of your opposition and the manner in which
that criticism was offered. a certain kind of postmodern read could
be taken of your statements that implied that everything you've
written is in fact ironic.

there are elements of that in Plato's republic as well, though, so
even if i'm right you're in pretty good company.

When the machine can write a sonnet, I'll be impressed. Can it write a sonnet? If a mere algorhythm can produce your kind of "experimental" poetry, then perhaps you're not really doing anything that interesting.

Dear Alan:

I don't think that the discussion means that "the right has won," at all.
Perhpas some might see the creators of the programme producing the Anthology
as "the Right" as it is intended as an anti-experimental example; that is,
that a computer program can produce peoms just as intersting as any given
set of "experimental" as well as dead poets.

The anaology with terorism is not to say at all that the anhtology is
terrorist, or even terrifying.  For you it brought a sense of wonder, and
wonder is something the world is ever in good need of.

I think that --well, I know in my case, what intersts me and brings a sense
of wonder is how many things have a doubled, punning nature, are two edged
swords.  On the one hand a method may produce an anthology of poems; on the
other hand the same method may be used to fill a prison with "suspects"
complete with the "evidence" from an "unidentified source."

Personally, I don't think there is a "terrorist" aspect to the project in
itself,; rather, like many hoaxes, it is intended to expose an aspect of
something whith which the authors are in disagreement, or are crritical of,
or simply laughing at.

The real Terror is when the State uses forged documents and faked evidence
to begin genocidal Wars as the US State has in Iraq.  The use of lies to
mureder milions and destroy an entire society and culture--well, the US has
done this before, right "at home," it is only that the technology used has
changed.

Barry has a very good point.  I don't know if anyone here--I am sure many
probably have!--has run into someone they know who is a hard core Dead Head,
and has just acquired about a hundred new bootleg tapes and CDs of Dead
shows from various tours that they immmediately kindap you and hold you
hostage until you have gone with "on the journey" for many long long long
hours, far longer than one can bear, if one were not a captive audeince so
to speak.

When you have heard about fifty different versions of the same song which
are being played amazingly almost exactly the same--even the "jams" after
awhile are incredibly similar--the non Dead Head is bewildered by the
endurance for montony and self-consistence which one's Dead Head friend
has.  yet al the while, the Dead head will point out some very tiny
difference, some slightly different vibration in the Cosmic groove--as
though this is a Revelation from the
Mighty Source itself.

I've been passionate about some artists in the same manner, and listened to
every single creaky old vinyl, every bootleg, every cassette recorded radio
show, of some one whose music I was manic about--and within the same song
performed a different time heard entire symphonies of difference, where
others might not distinguish anything much other than a variation in the
degree of the quality of the recording from good to barely non-noise sounds.


I also used to collect versions of the smae song done by as many artists as
I could find, especially obscure Punk gargae band versions of massively
covered songs.  One might hear five or six bands in a row that sounded
almost identical, trying their hardest to sound note for note like the
Yardbirds, say.  Then would come some explosion and a suddenly completely
different version, so different that in effect it was a completely new song.

(In Jamaica, when an artist cut a cover, they called it simply "Version.")

As an auctioneer in Vermont my brother and I were fans of said once, when
selling "a real special pair of tires,"--"what makes these tires so special,
you see, is that one's the same and the other's different."

And they sold at quite a good price!

Lists of names with affixed "crimes" have been produced throughout history
to send persons to prison or beheadings, the gallows or simply to vanish
into the Blacklist oblivions.  It is simply that now with computers having
at their disposal such massive lists of names and amounts of information--as
well as disinformation--one could indeed compile both an Anthology of poetry
as well as a list of suspects to be "detaineed indefinietly."

The wonder to me is how different--or even the same-- persons, taking the
same method, may see quite different methods of employing it.

After all, not that long after the invention of writing in ancient Iraq--the
first forgeries also began to appear.

Considering what has happened to Iraq based on forgeries--
one may ask, is that thanks there is for the invention of writing?--

As though writing itself is to pen a Pandora's Box!--

Tom,

Thank you. I was fascinated to read the perimeters within which Jim
Carpenter has built his program: a grammatical model interacting with a
finite lexical set. I would be curious to know how one can build a
grammatical model which, it seems to me, may contain infinite variations. I
wonder if by grammatical model he means a set of rhetorical devices, which
is more circumscribed.

I am particularly fascinated by his idea of an "inhibiting" dimension to
contain the "irrational exhuberance" of his software program, its
permutative possibilities, to prevent the result fom turning into
"gibberish." A few months ago, I was discussing with Chris Funkhauser an
idea he posits in the last section of his book, *Pre-Historic Digital Poetry
* (a great book, by the way). Chris says that for digital poetry truly to
become its own, first, it must develop a sense of the "outside"; second, the
digital language must integrate the ability to "learn." I responded that,
since in digital work learning consists of positive reinforcements of
responses to it, does learning not progressively narrow down the range
within which the program moves -which is the very opposite of developing an
outside. I told him perhaps what digital work needs is the ability to
un-learn, to create resistances to its cumulative knowledge (or, may be put
in another way, its permutational impulse). Resonance occurs moving through
a resistant space. I wonder if Jim Carpentar's inhibiting dimension is
pointing to something similar to "unlearning" or if it has a more limited
practical application, basically an attempt to create "balance," a kind of
golden rule.

Ciao,

Murat

"See if yr theories don't meet with some suspicion on the streets of
Michigan."

I live in Michigan, in Lansing, to be specific, where the median income is
somewhere around poverty level. No one I know has seen any type of
trickle-down help, myself included.

Freeing up the market won't help until the government stops intervening. If
this country is to have a truly free, capitalist market, then no more
bailouts, for anything. No government intervention in the market. I give it
less than a decade to implode.

To ignore history is to ignore facts. History shows that the countries with=
 the freest economies were and are the richest countries -- for everyone li=
ving there. History shows that countries with the least free economies have=
 been poorest and the worst polluters. =0A=0AYou mistake mixed and interven=
tionist economies with free markets. You complain about power, then want to=
 hand it all over to a handful in government. The free market distributes p=
ower. Government concentrates it. At least, history shows this to be true. =
Rather than opposing free markets, one should insist on their being institu=
tions in place that prevent concentrations of power that create the problem=
s to recognize. I will say, though, that the free market system does not oc=
cur in tribal situations. It emerges with complexity of society. =0A=0AI am=
 not at all interested in a equal distribution of wealth. That has never cr=
eated wealth anywhere. Resentment is what makes people want equal distribut=
ion, and resentment destroys the soul as well as society. Those sour faces =
come from resentment, fostered by those who want redistribution of wealth. =
A fair distribution of wealth occurs when people engage in things that resu=
lt in a just creation of wealth -- when they engage in free and open trade =
with others. =0A=0AThe U.S. is not the most violent, though we are up there=
.. We are not the biggest polluters, despite the fact that we are the bigges=
t consumers. Pollution is waste, and anybody who wants to maximize profits =
wants to eliminate waste. We are anti-social in this country for reasons th=
at have little to do with the free market, and more to do with certain psyc=
hologically isolationist ideologies such as existentialism and postmodernis=
m that have pervaded this country. Most rural areas are still quite friendl=
y, by the way. =0A=0AI, by the way, am quite green. I don't think I ever us=
ed that term in a negative way. I think the Leftist greens are not so much =
green as red, so I do oppose them. There is a kind of free market green of =
which I am a member. Property rights are the best way to keep the planet gr=
een and to protect species (as a recent Science article suggests in recomme=
nding we get rid of the fisheries commons if we want to avoid making certai=
n species extinct and to avoid a fisheries collapse).=0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=

Ironically, that sort of statement places more importance on the easily
analyzable structure and technique of a poem than on its subjective effects.
Dickinson, who I seem to recall writing in formal verse, would have been
horrified. More to the point, it seems to ignore even devalue the main
difference between we humans and machines so far, which is that capability
for irreproducible and not-wholly-logical internal experience. Last I
checked, the definition of interesting was more connected to that than to
whether a machine could imitate an item's structure.

Furthermore, I wonder if it has occurred to you that it's possible that
people haven't created sonnet-writing programs because the people creating
writing programs are more interested in experimental styles.

Having watched this conversation for a bit, I'd like to make a few
suggestions towards the possibility of creating a good-faith exchange that
might actually open up some interesting debates:

               1) Don't use the terms socialism or communism. Clearly, there
are several different     definitions of it in play in this conversation.
Socialism with Chinese characteristics, for example, as I personally
witnessed in the PRC, has nothing to do with any theoretical socialism or
communism I've ever heard of. While I have far less personal experience with
the Kingdom of Cambodia, what people I met there told me would lead me to
conclude the same. If you want to say socialism or communism, say instead
what you mean by those words.
                    I'm not trying to say here that anyone is using an
incorrect definition, merely that right now the use of different definitions
is getting in the way of a good conversation.

               2) Drop the terms Left and Right; while they can be a useful
shorthand, their use in this conversation seems to be leading to a lot of
jabs and emotional outbursts that are not helping.

               3) Try to ask questions, and not merely rhetorical ones, in
your emails. I have never been able to understand someone better without
asking questions, and trying to understand someone better is a big part of
doing something other than simply try to prove that you're correct.

Anyway, these are just a few ideas that come from my own efforts to spend
less time engaged in pissing matches on the Internet and more time learning
from other people (and if you don't think a woman can piss farther than the
guys, then you've never met one who was a Camp Fire girl.)

Under 'About' :

This project originated as a graduate research project the intent of which
was to learn whether machine-generated poems could compete in the
marketplace with the poems of blooded authors. (They can.) But it has
evolved into an aesthetic proposition: That the MACHINE is a legitimate
methodology for artistic expression.

In so doing it has also become a barometer for measuring the sincerity (even
the humanity) of the community of academic writers and critics whose
gatekeeper status it openly seeks to subvert: We're pretty sure they aren't
wearing any clothes, but you never know, they might just have a corner on
the invisible threads market.

That is not to say that the project is an elaborate articulation of the
often voiced objection to contemporary art that "My 5-year-old could do
that!" And the obvious response: "But she didn't." That is not it at all.
Rather, the project seeks to disrupt the Academy's mission of exclusion, its
selfishness and greed, its supercilious arrogance. It does so by composing
texts that democratize both the processes of reading and writing. It's
obvious that many of Erica's poems are as good as most of what emerges as
academic verse. But more important, absent an author, any reader's reading
is a valid reading.

In short, We don't need no fucking academician to tell us how we don't get
it, how we could never get it. We get it--we *always* got it.

Fine with me, it goes with the Dadaists (1916-1920), nothing new under the
usual Sun. It also stuck with our private pasts, usually a typical
adolescent syndrome. It sticks with us, otherwise we would not be here in
this moment typing and typing and trying to invent. The Machine is new,
partly. As Eric Elshtain already said, we had Racter before (1970,
exceptional, indeed!).
The same quotation shows where we are:

 *poetry is still the biggest snob-racket in the Arts with little poet
groups battling for power - Charles Bukowski

*
*The*
We, children of Bukowski. Then, why am I disturbed? Why am I writing in this
moment? I don't think that I am a fucking Academician, even if I teach. Nor
do I think that Barry Schwabsky is, nor Tom Orange. We could be sharing the
rules of a competition for the "best," but within this process there is a
refinement that requires a lot of work. If on one side I applaud this
Anthology, on the other I do not agree with the verbalization of the
Authors. Authors, by the way, who are themselves part of the same process
since the Experiment was "originated as a graduate research project."

Just this. I accept their work and cheered it. They should be humble enough
to accept mine.

I wonder if this is the intention - certainly I haven't seen it stated

just isn't interesting in any case!

Yes! But I do find the analogy problematic.

This is true of almost anything; you can use a fork to eat or to stab

But certainly it's not a hoax - it's far too transparent for that. Which
is one of the things that makes it interesting - it occupies an anomalous
position in relation to the 'fake.'

Absolutely, not to mention doing this on our own turf as well.

That's generally true of restrictive styles in general, even blues or Carl

But lists don't _inherently_ have these connotations, any more than
positive connotations. And for lists, of course there's Auschwitz, the
HUAC blacklists, all sorts of lists; even the Poetics list is just that, a
doubled list, of subscribers < email posts > archives.

Which is also true of a fork or just about anything, I think.

That I haven't read, are you talking about after the bullae? I think
Egyptian hieroglyphics have been pushed back earlier recently. I also
think that even before the invention of writing - graffiti! - in other
words, a poetics of the (im)proper name.

> Considering what has happened to Iraq based on forgeries-- one may ask,

Again, I'm likely to thank Egypt; I also think China can be pushed back.
Not to mention Acheulian pebbles which are a form of writing, from France,
and Marshak's early book on scratched enumerations/tallies on bones going
tens of thousands of years back in Europe. More and more I think the idea
of _an_ origin of writing - in the sense of a singularity - is going to be
questioned.

I find it interesting as an aside that Sarah Palin can't deal with the
'issues' but her handlers have her verbally spewing hatred which usually
starts and stops with being local except for the occasional new/byte
that comes up here to Brooklyn.

Yes, it can write a sonnet.
Why are algorithms "mere"? Have you ever written one?
In fact algorithms or machines or organisms can produce boring or
interesting writing, whatever, which increasingly has very little to do
with the source of the production but more with the wonder and delight of
the reader.

 that, though what we have since learned from systems science is that such =
a dream is impossible. Still, you hear it in political rhetoric all the tim=

One of the reasons I want to take my time carefully replying on this thread
is that the literary hoax is directly aimed at many of the reasons this lis=
t
devolved into obsessive postings about computers, identity, and
experimentation, and also about identity and hoaxes and writing and then
became a mostly announcements list.



Many, if not most, hoaxes are misanthropic; this is certainly no exception.
See the JACKET hoax issue for more information about a few 20th century
poetry hoaxes (including my article on Marjorie Seiffert, who was involved
in an anti-modernism hoax).  The primary genesis, for the editor, is
supposedly



"One morning about a month ago, I received a message from the Poetics List
that began something like 'Announcing Issue 1 of Broken Caterpillar.
Featuring new poems by . . . followed by a list of 45 poets' names. I'd see=
n
one of them on Silliman's blogroll, but the rest were just flat names.
Barely names -- ethereal text strings. Keep in mind that I receive hundreds
of these announcements per year."



Words =96 nouns =96 names =96 no longer indicate anything to the future edi=
tor; he
feels besieged by an announcements list he has chosen to join.  He doesn't
manipulate text well, as the dupes in the names list indicate.  Find and
replace two spaces with one, alpha sort, delete dupes.



He finds the announcements nature of the list funny, and the complaints of
those whose names he's used =96 or not =96 numbingly funny.  I don't think =
it
funny, but this is the hoax's point.  A feeling of exclusion yields to sang
froid when others feel excluded?  The list ought to be dominated by divisiv=
e
arguments about hoax poetry and computers & poetry, and not about
announcements?  I would love to find the spot in the archive pointing to
Broken Caterpillar.



If it is any solace at all, Bob Cobbing is probably on the list because
there were so many tribute sections in 'zines after he died.



As I've mentioned, I am concerned with my name being associated with what I
did not write, not because I wish to protect my literary reputation or
identity (I am far too online not to have my identity stolen with great
regularity), but because this is a poorly-designed and executed literary
project of misanthropic intent I do not share (I am made a target, in fact)
and it is repeatable.  Names of (mostly) artists have been associated with
things they did not make.  The anthology demonstrates malign results can
spring from a fairly benign idiocy.  "The seal is broken," as my college
friend Keith McCabe would say.


The second post could be about Carpenter, but it could also be about Ray
Biachi's great book I just published that uses, oh, you know, Mein Kampf an=
d
some fairly simple web-based cutup engines as starting points to individual
pieces.  He wrote it; Waltraud Haas did some great drawings to complete the
collaboration.

I hope to try to enter some of my thinking into the discussion, because
while I have long been interested and involved in computers and poetry, I
really don't follow the beaten path.  Jim Carpenter's work is I
feel misapplied / poorly designed in this hoax.



But just because copyright is waived and/or fair use / creative commons use
is encouraged doesn't mean Carpenter didn't write the code, btw.

All best,

Those who have children usually like to raise them not to inflict damage but
to contribute in the spirit of cooperation, enjoyment, and benevolence. We
would do well to extend that attitude to our art works, also.

Pranks will amuse during adolescence.

The power of the prank to amuse doesn't last long though.

There is much more serious work to do in machine poetry than fooling
editors.

The important issues are as important as the question of what we are, what
it is to be human.

When we look at the poetry communities and the dynamics thereof, what gets
lauded, accepted, and why, well, it's all over the map from silly to serious
(and will be for the duration). More important is why we ourselves are
involved in poetry and what we ourselves are trying to do. Eventually it
isn't sufficient simply to subvert the corpus but to offer a body of
work--whether of poetry or criticism or whatever, poemy poems or some
alternative--that *is the thing itself you want to bring into the world*,
not just criticisms of what already is.

forms are an algorithm. although i've never tried, i would think that
getting a machine to compose something according to the following
algorithm

print fourteen lines
each must contain 5 feet or redo
final output must adhere to rhyme scheme abab cdcd efef gg or redo
insert stanza breaks at lines four, eight, and 12

would not be all the difficult. now, it may not be a good sonnet, and
that's where the art of something like Erika T. Carter comes in is in
the figuring out of what the machine has to do in order to pass
quality muster.

now we're getting somewhere. i would put the following question to
you: on what grounds do you assert that spontaneous order economies
are better than the mixed economies of the sort present in the
developed world?

in answering, i'd also like you to answer the following questions:

1.) what is the standard by which an economy can be judged better or
worse than another?
2.) how do you know that your ideological preference for naturally
operating unregulated markets would work the way you think they well
in a technologically advanced society given that the theory you hold
has never been attempted in such a system? Particularly given that
moves in that direction have often been shown to be disastrous on a
macroeconomic scale (see our latest financial crisis, argentina in
the nineties, the great depression)

second point: while your historical breakdown of the roots of the
left and right tying them to the french revolution are interesting, I
would argue that they are in fact not found there, although it's
clear that the impact of the revolution on the ideals of the
enlightenment is important and must be recognized. I would in fact
argue that the enlightenment, from which the political philosophies
we are talking about actually originate, has it's roots much earlier
in the protestant reformation and the english civil war. the right
left divide that obtained in the run up to the french revolution is a
convenient political shorthand but in fact the issues exist on
something more than the one dimensional scale that that implies. this
is civics 101 stuff, though, with which I'm sure you're familiar. the
point i would make though is that given your opposition towards both
left and right on some issues, it makes more sense for you to abjure
those phrases and try to speak in different terms that are less
loaded ideologically if only to avoid the retort that your own
beliefs are right wing.

because, sir, your beliefs on political economy are in our discourse
right wing. granted they are not the ONLY beliefs held by members of
the right, but the sort of economic anarcholibertarianism that you
are describing, if one has to stick it on the spectrum, is more in
line with the fundamental philosophies of the american right (reduced
government intervention in all things due to a fundamental mistrust
of government to either act effectively and/or avoid abusing power.)
It's a powerful philosophy and it's one that is well supported in the
tradition of jeffersonian republicanism, which I think is one of the
greatest things that the American experiment has offered the world.
however it's worth noting that while Jefferson was certainly a
radical, and given his support of the reign of terror one very much
in line with the original french left, the ideas of jeffersonian
republicanism due to their allegiance with proslavery democrats and
the states rights ideologies of the antebellum south, as well as the
later allegiance to corporatism and anti-communism post world war II,
have become in the american discourse right wing positions. you are
of course free to dispute this, but i don't think i'm the only one
who sees things that way.

of course you will be able to find examples of right wing politicians
who disagree with you. but thats because there isn't just one right
wing in america, just as there isn't just one left wing. the right
wing of pat buchanan, descended from william jennings bryan (a
remarkable man with whom i find myself in the strange position of
disagreeing almost as often as i agree) is not the same right wing as
George Bush sr, which strangely enough, is not the same right wing as
george w. bush jr. And none of them are the same right wing as
richard nixon who for all of his personal flaws is also a much more
complex figure than the popular characature allows for.

In closing, I would argue that the complexity of angloamerican
politics in particular, given the divides along the axes of liberty
vs. fraternity, liberty vs. equality, and equality vs. fraternity, to
which fundamental conflicts I think we are all heirs, left and right
alike, requires much more careful language in discussing both
individual issues and the labels we wish to attach to our ideas and
eachother.

On the last statement, I don't think so. They are creating programs that can do what is easy. Creating a program that can create sentences that are grammatical, logical, and have sound-rhythms, whether it be iambic or rhymes, and structural rhythms is practically impossible for a computer to do at the present time. What computers can do is throw labeled words together into simple grammatical trees to create something that sounds like "experimental" poetry. If people could write an actual sonnet-writing program, they'd have done so. Many of the people I know who are into using computers for this sort of thing would certainly love to be able to do it.

Ironically, that sort of statement places more importance on the easily
analyzable structure and technique of a poem than on its subjective effects.
Dickinson, who I seem to recall writing in formal verse, would have been
horrified. More to the point, it seems to ignore even devalue the main
difference between we humans and machines so far, which is that capability
for irreproducible and not-wholly-logical internal experience. Last I
checked, the definition of interesting was more connected to that than to
whether a machine could imitate an item's structure.

Furthermore, I wonder if it has occurred to you that it's possible that
people haven't created sonnet-writing programs because the people creating
writing programs are more interested in experimental styles.

I agree with the no more bailouts. The problems in Michigan come form the high taxes, restrictive regulations, etc. Michigan is very hard hit by its anti-market state government. But, if the government doesn't intervene, we won't get an implosion. QUite the contrary. If the federal government had told Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and AIG they were on their own, this who financial mess would have been over in that first week. The more they have tried to nationalize things, whether totally or partially, the worse things have gotten.

I live in Michigan, in Lansing, to be specific, where the median income is
somewhere around poverty level. No one I know has seen any type of
trickle-down help, myself included.

Freeing up the market won't help until the government stops intervening. If
this country is to have a truly free, capitalist market, then no more
bailouts, for anything. No government intervention in the market. I give it
less than a decade to implode.

Show me a sonnet written by an algorithm. I want to see it. Does it have the complexity of meaning found in a Shakespearean sonnet? Or a Petrarchan? Or one by any of the romantic poets? Does it have the proper development of a sonnet of thesis, antithesis, synthesis?

Algorithms are "mere" because they are math, the simplest form of knowledge on earth. They are typically linear (unless neural nets) and thus can only create simple things. I'm not saying that computers won't some day be able to create a sonnet, but they are nowhere near complex enough to create one with the kind of complexity a human can create yet. If you can, though, prove me wrong.

Yes, it can write a sonnet.
Why are algorithms "mere"? Have you ever written one?
In fact algorithms or machines or organisms can produce boring or
interesting writing, whatever, which increasingly has very little to do
with the source of the production but more with the wonder and delight of
the reader.

One of the reasons I want to take my time carefully replying on this thread
is that the literary hoax is directly aimed at many of the reasons this list
devolved into obsessive postings about computers, identity, and
experimentation, and also about identity and hoaxes and writing and then
became a mostly announcements list.

The bottom line is the entire damn thing is *trivial.

It says little about identity and less about post-modernism.

There's a slight degree of interest here insofar as this turns on
computer-generated texts -- but insofar as it intersects with (as has been
suggested) dadaist phenomena or Situationist manifestations ...

My earlier impression would have been that the impetus behind the project w=
as not necessarily misanthropic but possibly just playful. (And of course i=
t is the work of two people; they may have different agenda.) But as I cons=
ider it more, however, I'd agree that there is a strong component of misant=
hropy involved. But implied in what you write here is that to ascribe misan=
thropy to a literary work is in itself a negative. I don't think that can b=
e right. Although I myself am not at all misanthropic (I don't think), I ca=
n't deny that there is much just cause for misanthropy in the world. And mi=
santhropy has been a motiviating factor in much great literature--Celine, B=
ernhard, and Swift are just thee first to come to mind.=0A=0A=0A=0A----- Or=

new from ntamo:
LOCAL COLOUR by derek beaulieu
http://ntamo.blogspot.com/2008/10/derek-beaulieu-local-colour.html
Local Colour is a full colour page-by-page interpretation of Paul =
Auster's novella Ghosts. Ghosts concerns itself with Blue, a private =
detective hired by a mysterious character named White to transcribe the =
actions of Black, a denizen of Brooklyn Heights. As Blue reports his =
findings, the reader becomes more aware of the intricate relationship =
between Black and White, and a tactile awareness of colour spreads =
through the narrative.

With Local Colour, Canadian conceptual novelist and visual artist derek =
beaulieu has removed the entirety of Auster's text, leaving only =
chromatic words-proper nouns or not-spread across the page as dollops of =
paint on a palette.=20
The colours, through repetition, build a suspense and crescendo which is =
loosened from traditional narrative into a more pointillist =
construction.

derek beaulieu is the author of chains (2008), fractal economies (2006), =
with wax (2003) and co-author, with Gary Barwin, of frogments from the =
frag pool: haiku after basho (2005). His conceptual novel flatland: a =
romance of many dimensions was published in 2007.

beaulieu's writing is a record of reading, a trace of absence. A writing =
without writing.

Local Color: 8.5" x 11", 80 pages, full colour ISBN 978-952-215-049-3, =

How can you prove any of this? Can you prove that nationalization causes a
worsening? When business is privatized and "deregulated", how is there any
accountability? Are we relying on the good thoughts of entrepreneurs and the
joyous gut feelings of investors?

Troy,

Wasn't this same quip used in your attack on younger poets not being as
talented? "Show me their complexity," you bellowed. That this "show me the
complexity" continues to come up baffles me...

Creating a program that can create sentences that are grammatical, logical, and have sound-rhythms, whether it be iambic or rhymes, and structural rhythms is practically impossible for a computer to do at the present time. What computers can do is throw labeled words together into simple grammatical trees to create something that sounds like "experimental" poetry. If people could write an actual sonnet-writing program, they'd have done so. Many of the people I know who are into using computers for this sort of thing would certainly love to be able to do it.

Hi,

I just wanted to weigh in a bit on some of the recent discussion about
Issue 1 and maybe help to make a couple of things clear.

First off, Issue 1 is not a hoax nor a prank.  It is (and I think
should have been immediately seen as) parody, parody as obvious as
anything on The Onion.  If there is anything amusing about the
project, it is that so many folks did not see that.  Maybe that's
because it is bad parody.  I'm too close to the project to be
objective about that--I'll leave it for others to make that judgement.
 But speaking for myself, there was no intent to fool anybody, just to
evoke a chuckle or two.

Second, the ETC project is, and should be discussed as, separate from
Issue 1.  I was multiply motivated to continue the project after
completing my thesis.  I did not feel as if the thesis satisfactorily
answered the question as to whether machine poetry could compete with
traditional poetry.  I had attempted to devise and implement some
controlled testing, but could not for the life of me devise an
adequate null hypothesis.  So after some considerable time, decided
that the only way to test was to actually send out the work and see
what happened.  It was important that in sending poems out I not
identify them as machine works because that would irreparably
compromise the experiment.  Some editors would accept the work only
because it was  borne of the machine and others would reject it for
the same reason. So Erica was born.  And of course that kind of
exercise does have at least some of the characteristics of the hoax.
And I confess to some pleasure in the act.

And as are most alternative artists (and I would think, just about
everyone who participates in this list), I wanted to be disruptive.

But there is another, to me, more important motivation, which speaks
squarely to Issue 1.  And that has to do with the broader community of
computational artists, particularly those working with text.  A
problem confronting these artists is where to get text to support
their work, especially since the demands of an artifact capable of
processing thousands of elements per second and storing gigabytes of
data require enormous amounts of it.  It is physically impossible to
manually write the 1000s of pages needed to support certain types of
work.  Further, developing excellence in the skill sets required for
developing computational artifacts and literary artifacts would
require double the effort it takes to become either a
highly-skilled technician or highly-skilled author.  My thoughts were
that artificially generated texts could be used in such works.  (One
of the reasons I wrote the most recent version in Java was to
facilitate such usage--and also why I've posted the source.)  So far
only Issue 1 has taken me up on that.

Finally, all of this is past.  I have turned to other interests, none
of them computational, and at this time, have no ambitions toward
furthering the project (another reason for releasing the source).  If
the project has value, someone else will pick it up.  If not, not.
BTW:  There is a clear line along which Erica's poetry can be improved
significantly, which does not require any programming knowledge
whatsoever.  Just a little Xml.

If anyone is interested, I am happy to respond to questions about the
software's design.  Just email me directly: jcarpenter47@gmail.com

Best,
--jim

I think that the failure of the US auto industry to compete
effectively with Asian companies might have something to do with
Michigan's plight. That inability to compete famously has a lot to do
with the reative quality of the project, but also with the unfair
disadvantage American companies face because of the lack of a
national health care system--it simply costs Detroit and Flint a lot
more to keep its workers healthy.

Anyway, it's a done deal. For the next few years a lot of banks are
going to be run for the most part by the feds. We'll see how it goes.

Let me ask you: what would it take to write a program that could construct grammatical sentences? I'll even go so far as to suggest not including the lists of words as part of the algorithm. How many more bits of information are required by the written program to create the sentence than are required by the sentence it produces?

The arts are more more complex than the social sciences, like economics and sociology
Economics and sociology are more complex than psychology
Psychology is more complex than biology
Biology is more complex than chemistry
Chemistry is more complex than physics
Physics is more complex than math, on which it is built.

The more complex something is, the more complex the math needed to explain it. It has been shown that there are things in the universe that are so complex, that even if the math were developed, it would take longer to do the calculations than to just sit there and wait for it to happen. Why? Math is too simple to properly deal with it. That is why the most complex things listed either do not have the math do describe them, or only use statistics.

And, yes, I know math can be nonlinear. I mentioned neural nets, though I also know there are more. There are also the kinds of time series which give rise to fractal patterns, among others.

It's because complexity is a essential element to good art. Do not mistake complexity for complicatedness. Complicated means "knotted," meaning once you unknot the thing, you find out that what is there is one-dimensional, that it is simpler than you thought it was. Complex means "folded," meaning there are layers upon layers. As you get into the thing, you find out there is more and more there than you could have first imagined. SOmething folded has a surface you can see, of course -- meaning it has something anyone can enjoy -- but the more you get into the work, the more there is, and the more you can learn about it. If the more you read something, the less you get out of it, that work was complicated (and, I would also argue, ugly); if the more you read something, the more you get out of it, that work was complex (and, I would argue, beautiful).

There's been a lot of work done in this field, as you probably know.
SmarterChild is the irritating pop culture example. But a current
researcher who comes to mind in a literary context is Nick Montfort,
who's done a lot of work on dynamic grammar generation for interactive
fiction. That is, his software comprehensibly 'talks back' to the
user, without using the madlib cut-and-paste method you'd see in a MOO
or something.


>I'll even go so far as to suggest not including the lists of words as part of the algorithm.

This doesn't really make sense, unless you're talking about a program
that goes out into the wild and automatically learns its vocabulary
and grammar by crunching huge data sets.

Yes, there are obscure cases in which flipping a coin solves a problem
faster than carrying out the necessary calculations. Is this what
you're talking about? But these are really esoteric cases, and
definitely exceptions to the rule. Would you flip a coin repeatedly to
calculate the load distribution among suspension cables in the process
of building a bridge? Would you just let the bridge 'happen' by
itself? Would you give the project to a team of poets? It seems to me
that this sort of "math vs. poetry" conversation bears little fruit
and breaks down quickly.

My earlier impression would have been that the impetus behind the project w=

work of two people; they may have different agenda.) But as I consider it m=

But implied in what you write here is that to ascribe misanthropy to a lite=

work is in itself a negative. I don't think that can be right. Although I
myself am not at all misanthropic (I don't think), I can't deny that
there is much just cause for misanthropy in the world. And misanthropy has =
been
a motiviating factor in much great literature--Celine, Bernhard, and Swift =

just thee first to come to mind.

One of the reasons I want to take my time carefully replying on this thread
is that the literary hoax is directly aimed at many of the reasons this lis=

experimentation, and also about identity and hoaxes and writing and then
became a mostly announcements list.



Many, if not most, hoaxes are misanthropic; this is certainly no exception.
See the JACKET hoax issue for more information about a few 20th century
poetry hoaxes (including my article on Marjorie Seiffert, who was involved
in an anti-modernism hoax).=A0 The primary genesis, for the editor, is
supposedly



"One morning about a month ago, I received a message from the Poetics List
that began something like 'Announcing Issue 1 of Broken Caterpillar.
Featuring new poems by . . . followed by a list of 45 poets' names. I'd
seen
one of them on Silliman's blogroll, but the rest were just flat names.
Barely names -- ethereal text strings. Keep in mind that I receive hundreds
of these announcements per year."

He finds the announcements nature of the list funny, and the complaints of

think it
funny, but this is the hoax's point.=A0 A feeling of exclusion yields to
sang

arguments about hoax poetry and computers & poetry, and not about
announcements?=A0 I would love to find the spot in the archive pointing to
Broken Caterpillar.



If it is any solace at all, Bob Cobbing is probably on the list because
there were so many tribute sections in 'zines after he died.



As I've mentioned, I am concerned with my name being associated with what I
did not write, not because I wish to protect my literary reputation or
identity (I am far too online not to have my identity stolen with great
regularity), but because this is a poorly-designed and executed literary
project of misanthropic intent I do not share (I am made a target, in fact)
and it is repeatable.=A0 Names of (mostly) artists have been associated wit=
h
things they did not make.=A0 The anthology demonstrates malign results can
spring from a fairly benign idiocy.=A0 "The seal is broken," as my
college
friend Keith McCabe would say.


The second post could be about Carpenter, but it could also be about Ray
Biachi's great book I just published that uses, oh, you know, Mein Kampf
and
some fairly simple web-based cutup engines as starting points to individual
pieces.=A0 He wrote it; Waltraud Haas did some great drawings to complete t=
he
collaboration.

I hope to try to enter some of my thinking into the discussion, because
while I have long been interested and involved in computers and poetry, I
really don't follow the beaten path.=A0 Jim Carpenter's work is I
feel misapplied / poorly designed in this hoax.



But just because copyright is waived and/or fair use / creative commons use
is encouraged doesn't mean Carpenter didn't write the code, btw.

PRINTING POETRY: A LETTERPRESS WORKSHOP
Saturday October 18th 11AM-5PM

In this one day workshop with instructors Kyle Schlesinger and Daniel
Morris, you will learn the foundations of letterpress printing: how to
handle a composing stick, set type, set up the form, and operate a press
with safety and efficiency. Participants will be asked to bring one original
haiku or poem of a similar length and will take home a dozen hand printed
cards with envelopes. No printing experience is necessary for this workshop.

Hosted by The Arm in Brooklyn, New York.

Well, Congratulations. As I said in my previous previous post you had an
incredible marketing strategy, see the number of people who know of your
work now. And as I said in my previous post, the only thing I did not like
was the following sentence:
Rather, the project seeks to disrupt the Academy's mission of exclusion, its
selfishness and greed, its supercilious arrogance.

I do not identify with this concept and there are about 300 people that I
know who do not. Then, there are about a couple of dozens whom I would set
there, in their hell or arrogance, included some that you excluded (I love
it, chuckles from here),

devilishly,
me.

Post-ironic(?) or intelligent pre-ironic (including contemporary
country), lyrics sought for three separate Velvet Underground-meets-
Cramps generic garagerock cliche grooves
(on the cusp of oldie and antique, yet with just enough edge, what
current 'industry standards' would call sloppy, code for 'sweaty').
An understanding of the "syllabics of rock" an added bonus (or having
managed to get the lines "My voice is really warm, it's just that
it's got no form"
to go a groove that would put "The bird is the word" to shame).

Deadline is October 15th, 2008. 12 Noon EDT.

uards killed as soon as possible.=0A=A0=0A"We've launched in inquiry to ver=
ify the truth behind this news," Franco Roberto, a coordinator of the local=
 anti-mafia squad for Naples, told Reuters.=0A=A0=0AItalian papers said the=
 Naples mob's notorious Casalesi clan -- in the news recently over the murd=
er of six Africans, which sparked riots by other immigrants -- had moved th=
e threat into the "operative" phase and wanted Saviano dead by Christmas.=
=0A=A0=0AThe source of the tip-off was a "supergrass" related to the jailed=
 Camorra godfather Francesco Schiavone, aka "Sandokan."=0A=A0=0AThe Camorra=
 has its finger in every pie in Naples and the surrounding areas, from the =
protection racket to drugs and even waste disposal, as Saviano's book docum=
ents in great detail.=0A=A0=0AWith his shaved head, dark close-cropped bear=

 spends some of his time boxing with escorts "who sometimes call me 'captai=
n.'"=0A=A0=0AThe writer said it was the millions of people who had bought t=

the Italian public to show their solidarity with the writer.=0A"Nobody must=

I have no idea whatsoever why complexity is an essential element of good
art, beyond your sayso. If you look at Kant's sublime, where's the
complexity? Or for that matter Carl Andre or Robert Barry.

Personally I like ugly but that doesn't have to be complex or complicated
for that matter, either. - Alan

Hi Folks - I just wanted to remind you about the 7th Big CLWN WR Event tomorrow night, Thursday, October 16, 2008, at the SAFE-T-GALLERY (111 Front St., Gallery 214) in the DUMBO ("Down Under Manhattan Bridge Overpass") section of downtown Brooklyn.  It will start around 7:00 and will feature Paul Pines and Phyllis Wat, along with singers Carolyn Ota and Moira T. Smith, and writers Adriana Scopino, Jane Ormerod, Elizabeth Smith, Evie Ivy, Nathan Whiting, and George Spencer, and myself, host and CLWN WR editor, Bob Heman.  Admission is free.  Take the "F" train to York Street, then turn right and walk downhill to Front and turn left under the Manhattan Bridge.  I hope you all can make it.  As always it should be a lot of fun.
CLWN WR has been publishing a series of small poem issues containing works no larger than 50 (or sometimes 20) words.  From this date forward we will only consider poems no larger than 20 words.  We will also continue to publish a series of ephemeral CLWN WR "letter" issues for which we will consider only prose poems no larger than 300 words (but preferably a lot smaller).  We are particularly interested in the experimental, the minimal and the highly compressed, and in works in which the imagination manifests itself in unexpected ways.
CLWN WR was founded in 1971 by Bob Heman and Stephen Fairhurst, and has been edited by Bob Heman since its third issue.  It is never for sale.

with special guests:
hosted by Bob Heman
editor of CLWN WR since 1971

Apologies for any cross-posting, and please do forward!

DEEP OAKLAND CALL FOR PROPOSALS

Deep Oakland (www.deepoakland.org<http://www.deepoakland.org>) is an ongoin=
g collaborative website that presents archival and current materials about =
Oakland.

We are currently seeking proposals for intermedia projects to be presented =
online in 2009-10. We will be offering small start up grants (no more than =
$250 each) for proposals that need funding for materials.

We will consider both new creative works and archival projects. We are espe=
cially interested in work that examines the social, cultural, economic, his=
torical and political conditions into and out of which Oakland residents li=
ve, relate and make (make art, text, family, video, buildings, clothing, et=
c.) We are also interested in collaborative and multi-disciplinary projects=
.

Some examples of proposed projects and/or projects currently underway:

-          Studio visits / interviews with local artists.

-          Scene reports from performance sites (music, theater, reenactmen=
ts, readings, etc.)

-          A piece that focuses on sound recordings from farmer's markets i=
n several different Oakland neighborhoods.

-          A photography series of Oakland taco trucks documenting the cust=
omers at these locations at particular times, such as noon and midnight.

-          A photography series of houses and institutions meaningful in th=
e history of the Hell's Angels, and a photography series of houses and inst=
itutions meaningful in the history of the Black Panthers.

-          Video works: an hour-long visual & sonic exploration of east bay=
 tides/shoreline.

-          Mass observation of a location or event in Oakland and Miami, FL=
, and/or another city.

-          Short interviews with longtime Oakland residents and then presen=
tations of an older photo from their personal album, along with a current p=
hoto of the same location.

-          A collection of photographs, zines and other materials from priv=
ate archives of materials around the Weather Underground.

-          Walking tours.

We encourage those interested to take a look at the website. Proposals shou=
ld include a short description of the project, budget and material needs if=
 any, and some sort of work sample.

Please email proposals to deep.oakland@gmail.com<mailto:deep.oakland@gmail.=
com>. Consideration of proposals will begin on November 1 and continue unti=
l we run out of funds.

Seven of nine eye witnesses have recanted testimony and three persons have
come forth testifying another man has confessed to the murder of the police
officer that Troy Davis is convicted of.  The Supreme Court declined to give
a reason for its refusal to hear Davis' appeal.

   With
today's Supreme Court decision, a man with a credible claim to innocence may
soon be executed.

             Dear david,

Today, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Troy Anthony Davis' appeal.
His fate is back in the hands of Georgia authorities who may seek a new
execution date at any time.

The Supreme Court's decision to deny Troy Davis' petition means that *no
court of law will ever hold a hearing* on the witnesses who have recanted
their trial testimony in sworn affidavits.

Doubts about his guilt raised by these multiple witness recantations will
never be resolved. An execution under such a cloud of doubt would undermine
public confidence in the state's criminal justice system and would be a
grave miscarriage of justice.

*The state of Georgia can still do the responsible thing and prevent the
execution of Troy Davis: *

   - Write a letter to the
editor<http://www.kintera.org/TR.asp?a=8nKBIQMwHjLRL3I&s=afKHIRMyFdJNI3OEIqG&m=hhKQK0MEJjJ2G>calling
on Georgia to stop the execution of Troy Davis!
   - Call on the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles to
reconsider<http://www.amnestyusa.org/troydavis>its previous decision
and grant clemency to Troy Davis.
   - Urge your friends and family to go to *amnestyusa.org/troydavis* or
   text *TROY to 90999* to add their voices to the over 200,000 that have
   already taken action on this case.

          Join the fight for
justice.<http://www.kintera.org/TR.asp?a=fkLPIbPYIhJOJgL&s=afKHIRMyFdJNI3OEIqG&m=hhKQK0MEJjJ2G>

   *The Cut and Paste Poets  - An Anthology of Collage Poetry*

*Special Limited Edition Collector's Prepublication Version*

Greetings all,
I would like to announce the publication of a new book. This is a special
private stock collector edition without ISBN number or barecode as found on
commerically available books.  This is a chronological compilation of poetry
submitted to an email listserv dedicated to collage poetry. Some additional
notes by the authors are also included if they helped to illustrate the
intention, construction techniques or source material used in a particular
poem's creation. The email group was started as an online studio space where
poets and artists explore the methods of collage construction as it applies
to poetic texts. This group of collagists have become known as the Cut and
Paste Poets because of their methods of poetic construction. A wide range of
processes and techniques are represented in this volume illustrating the
breadth of possibilities involved in the use of found materials. Each poet
exhibits a definite and refined working style that encompasses a wide
ranging set of search and gathering methods to compile the raw materials for

This is a counterweighted railroad bridge, partly burned, which has been
raised for decades. You walk a couple of hundred feet out, and from there
Daniel Byers climbed vertically up to the top of the raised span, maybe
110 feet. Foofwa performed below. Azure Carter and I filmed in PAL and HD.
Rob watched from a beam. This was probably the most dangerous performance
to date. Foofwa was avatar but Daniel was in flight. There was no sky-
sphere. Daniel would have permanently broken if he fell. I tried to reboot
the game but it was useless. Daniel sat at the top. I think one other per-
son has made it to the top. The water was below just like the exhibition
space. The surface was perforated with broken, split, charred, burned, and
missing railroad ties. My left foot broadcast a lot of pain from a kind of
degeneration. Foofwa and Daniel were brilliant. Some kids watched. Some
kids smoked. Dance and climb were risky. I hugged the rails and lay on the
ties. It was impossible to take it all in. I couldn't teleport. None of
the prims had signs. I just filmed and filmed, Azure as well. Later Daniel
took one of the cameras up a couple of crossbeams. His videowork amazes
me. He's cool. Foofwa and Azure are cool. Rob's face was cool. I lay on
the beams and dreamed up a storm. The old country was never so hot.

UNTITLED (CONFERENCE):

SPECULATIONS ON THE EXPANDED FIELD OF WRITING

Friday October 24th to Saturday October 25th
At REDCAT, The Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater
631 West 2nd Street, Los Angeles CA 90012
The fifth in an annual series of experimental writing conferences at =20
REDCAT, =93Untitled=94 is a two-day conversation about writing which in =20=

some manner exceeds the printed page.  While we are familiar with =20
visual artworks constituted as a set of instructions, secrets written =20=

by visitors in a book, or one artist erasing of another artist's work, =20=

what would be their equivalents in the literary world?

=93Untitled=94 is a common title of contemporary art works and also =
refers =20
to the incipient moment of a new text or idea; it was chosen to convey =20=

a sense of openness and process.  A variety of writers and artists =20
will discuss the use of language and words and/or their object status, =20=

the book and the letter, the question of the "emptiness" vs. the =20
fullness of language as a poetic medium, the pictorial versus the =20
narrative, the incorporation of extra-linguistic symbols and signs =20
(maps, diagrams, formulas, etc.), the question of conceptual writing, =20=

and words off the page =96 performed, sited, projected, incanted, or =20
invoked.

Among the participants is Kenny Goldsmith, an =93uncreative=94 writer =
who =20
labels himself the =93most boring writer in the world=94  and writes =
books =20
that include everything he said for a week (Soliloquy, 2001), every =20
move his body made during a thirteen-hour period (Fidget, 1999), and a =20=

year of transcribed weather reports (The Weather, 2005).

Artist Young-Hae Chang is part of a =93corporate=94 web art group known =
as =20
Heavy Industries, whose short Flash texts have mesmerized the art =20
world with their combination of graphic boldness and acute commentary =20=

on culture, politics and commerce, yielding a new kind of literary =20
cinema.

Currently teaching in the Writing Program at CalArts, Salvador =20
Plascencia=92s first novel, The People of Paper, takes place in the =20
Chicano disapora.  Reflecting on the nature of literary characters, =20
some of his people are literally made of paper, and other characters =20
get paper cuts from them.

The conference will include two panels on the topic of =93Litterality,=94 =
=20
examining how writers use what we normally consider non-linguistic =20
elements, such as symbols, diagrams, maps, or scores placed in the =20
context of writing.  We will also look at invented writing systems, =20
and what it might mean to think about the book as an object rather =20
than as a collection of words or sentences.

As in the art world, many kinds of appropriation have been undertaken =20=

by experiemental writers in the last several years.  The panel on =20
=93Appropriation and Citation=94 will look a these practices, asking =20
questions about whose work and what material gets appropriated, cited =20=

or resurrected, who owns texts, and if there is a difference between =20
appropriation and citation.

A panel on =93The Meaninglessness or -fulness of Language=94 will =
examine =20
language as a vehicle of meaning.  Rather than look at what texts say, =20=

it asks if language simply taken on its own is empty, saturated with =20
meaning, both, or something else.

The fifth panel on =93the concept of conceptual writing," looks at the =20=

use of writing not to convey meaning or tell stories but to convey =20
concepts, asking how this might be similar, or not, to the work of =20
conceptual artists in the visual arena.
In addition to the five panels, there will be two evening readings.  =20
The participants in the conference are Young-Hae Chang Heavy =20
Industries, Latasha Diggs, Johanna Drucker, Kenneth Goldsmith, Robert =20=

Grenier, Douglas Kearney, Steve McCaffery, Julie Patton, Salvador =20
Plascencia, Jessica Smith, Brian Kim Stefans, Stephanie Taylor, =20
Shanxing Wang, and Heriberto Yepez.

Organized by Matias Viegener and Christine Wertheim of the Writing =20
Program at CalArts, and funded by The Annenberg Foundation. See =20

CALL FOR PROPOSALS:

2009/2010 LINKS HALL ARTISTIC ASSOCIATES
http://www.linkshall.org

DEADLINE: OCTOBER 31, 2008=20
Applicants do not need to be based in Chicago.=20

Links Hall=E2=80=99s Artistic Associates (AAs) each curate a month-long (fo=
ur-weekends, Fridays-Sundays) performance series for the Links Hall space, =
for which they receive a budget, along with marketing and technical support=
.  These programs have included dance, puppetry, live art/performance, expe=
rimental theater, readings, music, and multidisciplinary work.  There is in=
formation about the 2005-2008 AA programs on our web site: http://linkshall=
.org/o-aa.shtml.=20

AA projects have taken place annually since 2005, and have enhanced the qua=
lity of our artistic programs, generated significant press coverage, and ex=
panded audiences for new work at Links Hall.  The AA program format allows =
for welcome shifts in artistic perspective each year, keeping programming f=
resh and interesting. Many AAs have had limited or no curatorial experience=
 before, and the opportunity to curate a month-long program has been experi=
enced as an opportunity for new creative and professi on al development.

Links Hall plans to select three AAs for 2009-2010, and welcomes proposals.=
 The proposal review and selecti on of AAs will be made by Links Hall=E2=80=
=99s Programming Committee, which comprises artists (including some past AA=
s), as well as Links Hall Staff and Board members.=20

Selected AAs will receive:

* Space: Links Hall=E2=80=99s studio will be provided for the four weeks of=
 your project:

Evening hours for rehearsals: Tuesday-Thursday

2 hours before each performance showtime: Friday-Sunday

It is important that the multi-use nature of Links Hall is understood =E2=
=80=93 we have commitments to residency artists, classes, and other renters=
 for many daytime hours. The space must be completely cleared after each re=
hearsal and performance. Additional time can be made available for workshop=
s, classes, and public discussions. Please also note that rehearsal time is=
 provided for the technical and practical get-in and set-up of work, and no=
t for the creation/development of that work.

The space is a white room with a blonde wood floor. We have fixed riser sea=
ting for 65. If you would like to visit the space, to help with developing =
your curatorial ideas, please contact us to set up a time.=20
Note: Links Hall is a second floor walk-up; there is no elevator or escalat=
or.=20

* Budget: Links Hall will provide the following budget for your project:

Curator=E2=80=99s fee: $500

Program Budget: $2,500 plus 50% of ticket revenue

The program budget should cover artists=E2=80=99 fees, travel costs, accomm=
odati on , and technical/prop/material needs. Public workshop income, if an=
y, will usually be allocated 100% to your budget. In addition , Links Hall =
will provide marketing (print and electronic publicity) and technical suppo=
rt (Technical Director for the performances and some rehearsals). In some c=
ases, AAs work with Links Hall to secure additional funding, which has allo=
wed for larger scale projects -- including, for example, being able to pres=
ent visiting artists.

Each year's AAs are also invited to participate on  Links Hall's Programmin=
g Committee to select the subsequent year's AAs.=20

All practicing artists are welcome to submit a proposal, and no past curato=
rial experience is necessary.  AAs do not need to be based in Chicago . If =
you are based elsewhere, please reference in your proposal whether you plan=
 to be in Chicago for any program planning and/or your program.

We will review proposals in the context of Links Hall=E2=80=99s missi on : =
=E2=80=9CLinks Hall encourages artistic innovati on and public engagement b=
y maintaining a facility and providing flexible programming for the researc=
h, development and presentati on of new work in the performing arts.=E2=80=
=9D

AA programs are the largest scale public programs presented by Links Hall, =
and past AAs have worked closely with Links Hall and their artists to ensur=
e effective programs. We will select proposals that not on ly appear to be =
artistically innovative, but that appear practical in the c on text of the =
available resources (time, space, and budget), as well as the proposer=E2=
=80=99s likely ability to conceptualize, develop, and realize a large scale=
 project.

Please include the following items in your proposal. Do not exceed three pa=
ges in total:

* Contact information : Your name, contact mailing address, telephone numbe=
r, and email address.

* Project title: Please provide a working project title, and identify the a=
rtistic discipline(s) your project falls into.

* Creative process: Please summarize how participati on in the AA program w=
ould assist your creative process and development, and include a summary of=
 your arts-related experience (within the three page maximum noted above). =
Briefly describe your current areas of interest as an artist, and whether o=
r not you have past experience as a curator (past curatorial experience is =
not required).=20

* Project summary: Summarize your proposed curatorial project. Please expla=
in your interest in curating this project, as well as your goals and object=
ives. Is there a pressing need for the project (for example, a gap in progr=
amming in the City?) and what are the challenges involved in your project?

If you know which artists you would like to curate, please include a list o=
f their names; we do not require bio informati on about them. If you do not=
 know artists=E2=80=99 names, please make sure your proposal dem on strates=
 a clear picture of the likely content of your program.

If available, please indicate a general plan for your performance schedule.=
 Bey on d the expectati on that AAs will program four weekends of performan=
ces (Fridays-Sundays), we have no requirements regarding the structure of t=
he schedule: e.g. full length pieces vs mixed programs; different programs =
each week, or l on ger runs etc. Please review past AA programs to see diff=
erent approaches which have been undertaken. AAs are welcome to curate them=
selves into their programs.=20

Please identify any special technical requirements your project may have. T=
he Links Hall ground plan and Technical Handbook are available on line at h=
ttp://linkshall.org/a-tech.shtml=20

Note: we recommend scheduling artists with a focus on quality before quanti=
ty. Please be sure you are not curating a busy and technically demanding pr=
ogram which will unreas on ably stretch Links Hall=E2=80=99s office and tec=
hnical staff =E2=80=93 or yourself! However, a packed schedule of work whic=
h is low tech and low maintenance could n on etheless be effective.

* Additional programming/fundraising: Please indicate opportunities for add=
iti on al programming you would like to consider =E2=80=93 for example, wor=
kshops, discussions, off-site partnerships. Also include any ideas for addi=
ti on al fundraising you or Links Hall may like to pursue. Additi on al pro=
gramming and fundraising ideas are welcome in your proposal, but are not re=
quired.=20

* Audience development: Please describe the audience you plan to attract. H=
ow does this align with your understanding of Links Hall=E2=80=99s current =
audience base? What opportunities for new audience development does your pr=
ogram provide?

* Additional materials: Please include your resume (2 page maximum; this is=
 in addition to the 3 page maximum for your proposal). No artists=E2=80=99 =
documentati on (your own or the artists you plan to curate) is required. No=

create an endowment and establish a poet-in-residence program.

Washington Broadcast Set for "Torturing Democracy"

Reviewers rate new documentary "compelling," "impressive," "top-shelf"

Washington, DC, October 17, 2008 - The new documentary film on the Bush
administration's interrogation and detention policies, "Torturing
Democracy," will air on Washington D.C.'s WETA-TV tonight at 10 p.m.

Produced and written by eight-time Emmy winner and National Security Archiv=
e
fellow Sherry Jones, the documentary has drawn major online buzz as well as
New York Times coverage of PBS's failure to find a national scheduling spot
for the film before President Bush leaves office in January 2009.

Reviewers have described the film as a "compelling example of video
story-telling" that "delivers impressively on a promise to connect the dots
in an investigation of interrogations of prisoners in U.S. custody."

Slate.com selected a key revelation in the film as the Slate "Hot Document"
this week - a previously unpublished December 2002 draft of "standard
operating procedure" at Guantanamo which shows that interrogators there
adopted their techniques directly from the survival training (Survival
Evasion Resistance Escape or SERE) given to American troops so they could
resist the worst of Communist gulag treatment.

The companion Web site for the film, www.torturingdemocracy.org , features
key documents, a detailed timeline, the full annotated transcript of the
show, and lengthy transcripts of major interviews carried out for the film.
Hosted by the National Security Archive at George Washington University, th=
e
Web site will ultimately include a complete "Torture Archive" of primary
sources.

JOHN AMEN: PUTTING HIS LITERARY MAGAZINE ON A =93PEDESTAL=94

By Doug Holder

  John Amen is the founder of the well-regarded online magazine =93Pedest=
al=94=20
that was launched in 2000. His most recent poetry collection is titled: =93=
More=20
of Me Disappears=94 that was praised by the prominent American poet  Thom=
as=20
Lux . I talked with Amen on my Somerville Community Access TV Show: =93Po=
et=20
to Poet: Writer to Writer.=94



Doug Holder: Why did you start an online literary magazine like Pedestal.=
 Are=20
online lit. mags as important today as print journals?

John Amen:  In terms of starting the magazine I guess I have always been=20=

interesting in doing something like this. I always thought it would be a =
print=20
publication. Around 1998 or 9, I started to explore the Internet more. I=20=

noticed that there were a few literary magazines online like: PIFF, THREE=
=20
CANDLES, etc=85 I noticed a few science fiction on- line zines as well. W=
hen I=20
encountered this it seemed like a very interesting way to go. But there w=
as,=20
and still is, some prejudice against online publishing.

DH: Yeah, but some say Pedestal is as good or better than most print=20
magazines.

JA:  Yeah. I think so. I think we have come a long way. We have been arou=
nd=20
for eight years. We have managed to create something that is well regarde=
d.=20
It is gratifying to see how things evolved. We have brought together  the=
=20
tradition of poetry magazines with the technology of the time. I think we=
 have=20
traditional literary values in a modern setting.


DH: Are you a nonprofit?

=20
JA: Yes. Going nonprofit helped us a lot. The first time we went nonprofi=
t I=20
would open letters and see checks from readers, and it was kind of mind=20=

blowing. It was a mark of approval, validation.

DH:  How are you going to adjust for the economic straits the country is =
in?

JA: October is usually our fund raising month. We held off sending emails=
 to=20
readers. I thought that this would be the worst time to ask readers for m=
oney.=20
Fortunately we got a grant. We do pay writers. Right now we are going to=20=

publish the same amount. But we would modify it if need be.

DH: In an interview with poet Gloria Mindock, you said that you like bein=
g an=20
editor because they are on: =93 =85the firing line of creative endeavor.=94=
 Can you=20
expand on that?

JA: I am exposed to a lot of poetry, manuscripts. You see such diverse wo=
rk,=20
and you get a sense of what=92s going on. What are the collective mindset=
s?=20
Are the timeless themes still there? etc=85 You can see how things evolve=
=85you=20
have a sense of connection.

DH: Do you think you have seen more of your own work published because=20=

you are the editor of a well-known magazine?

JA: I think it helps more with speaking and reading engagements. I see it=
=20
primarily in that area, but it may be true in publishing.

DH: I notice you publish such well-known small press poets as Jared Smith=
,=20
A.D. Winans, and Eric Greinke. What do you look for in a poem?

JA: Jared=92s work has evolved and changed=85I like his work a lot.=20=20=


The poem has to have that intangible magic that grabs you buy the balls. =
Of=20
all the poems you=92ve read, what poem do you remember? And after all the=
=20
things you read only a few things really stick.

At Pedestal we are open to a lot of work that others might not be. There =
are=20
a lot of poets I have connected with that I am not sure other editors hav=
e. I=20
am not afraid to go with them.

DH: Does the buck stop with you?

JA: It varies. Sometimes I am more involved. If my editor is given full j=
udgment=20
over the work=97then I usually sit back.

DH: In your poems there is mention of time in NYC and drug abuse. Is this=
=20
autobiographical?

JA: Loosely. I did live in New York for a while. I have experience=20
with =94substances.=94 The details are modified.

DH: There are a lot of late night diners too.

JA: I always loved diners. Diners at 2AM, with bad coffee.

DH: I had a disagreement with Rebecca Wolff the founder of Fence Magazine=
.=20
I had asked her if any of her books were Print-On-Demand. She told me tha=
t=20
she would never use Print -On-Demand=85she never saw one that looked like=
 a=20
real book. Do you feel there is an elitist attitude toward POD? How do yo=
u feel=20
about POD as a method for publishing books?

JA: I emailed somebody, and asked him : =93What does it matter if somethi=
ng is=20
POD? He said the potential problem is that people put out these books but=
=20
they are not invested in them, so there is a surplus of books with no bac=
king.

  However most people I know who are involved in the business of publishi=
ng=20
poetry are pretty invested in poetry.

DH: I mean the publisher has to buy the books from the online printer, he=
 has=20
to edit them, select the poet, design the book, etc=85That=92s an investm=
ent.

JA: Financially it seems that it would be to the advantage of the publish=
er to=20
be invested in his project.

DH: Do you have an MFA?

JA: No. I majored in English and Philosophy as an undergrad. I took creat=
ive=20
writing classes as part of the degree and I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the spa=
ce to=20
explore and interact. I suppose, a lot of people go to an MFA to get a=20=

teaching job and to get published.

DH: Do you teach?

JA: I tutor high school age kids. I have taught four-day workshops at=20
Colleges, etc=85

DH: What would you tell the readers about submitting to Pedestal?

JA: Send us your work. We are always open. Pedestal is doing well and we =

going to be around.

2 hours of setup mishaps then running on a slower machine and line than
expected. Foofwa dances/proscenium & somewhat in the round, Second Life
projected behind him. Here doubled spaces and problematic: full round in
Second Life projected on a screen, proscenium and partial round in real
life, flattening the screen which is pushed further into the background
by virtue of the architecture, So modalities of architecture, performance,
and dance/behavior interact; the full depth of Second Life becomes more
illustration than anything else, and the shallow depth of the proscenium
becomes fecund, replete with possibilities, in the partial darkness. These
are orders of the real and virtual, of dancing and engineering, which
still clash in the new century; the entanglements will take decades to
work out, as human beings adjust to the newest furious computation speeds
tending towards more elaborate interfaces. The performance appears oddly
barren in the photographs; with sound and audience, it was electrifying.

Projective Industries results from an impression thrown off by steam press.

Projective Industries likes pop rocks.

Is there a little decency which Projective Industries may have picked
up in Canada?

Projective Industries buys technoorganic.

Projective Industries is breathless waiting for you.


We are please to announce the launch of www.projectiveindustries.com,
with new chapbooks by Thomas Hummel, Thibault Raoult, and Samuel
Amadon.

Small Press Traffic is thrilled to present:

Edwin Torres and Albert Flynn DeSilver

 Friday, October 24, 2008 at 7:30 p.m.
Timken Lecture Hall
Refreshments will be served

Join us!


 EDWIN TORRES has collaborated with a wide range of artists,
creating performances that intermingle poetry with vocal &
physical improvisation, sound-elements and visual theater.
He has received poetry fellowships from the New York Foundation
for the Arts, The Foundation For Contemporary Performance
Art, The Poets Fund and The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council.
He has taught workshops at Naropa University, St. Marks
Poetry Project, Bard College, Mills College and Miami University
among others. His work has been published in many anthologies,
and his CD, Holy Kid (Kill Rock Stars Records), is in the sound
archives of The Whitney Museum for American Art. He is co-
editor of the poetry journal/DVD Rattapallax. His books include,
The PoPedology Of An Ambient Language (Atelos Books),
Fractured Humorous (Subpress), The All-Union Day Of The Shock
Worker (Roof Books) and I Hear Things People Haven't Really
Said. His recent project is a collaboration with Spanic Attack
(www.spanicattack.com) called NORICUA, a noh-boricua inspired
non-movement gaining worldwide momentum, whose non-ideologies
have been performed in the Bronx, Berlin, Loisaida and Puerto Rico.

 ALBERT FLYNN DESILVER has recently begun his tenure as
Marin County's very first poet laureate. He is the author, most
recently of Letters to Early Street (La Alameda Press, 2007), and
Walking Tooth & Cloud (French Connection Press, 2007). Andrei
Codrescu has said about Letters to Early Street:"This is one of
our poets and we stand behind him (or to his side) in any fight,
physical or literary, he might be involved in. Except maybe the
situation he describes thus: 'A stuffed moose has just capsized in
my bed.'" Albert has published more than one hundred poems in
literary journals worldwide including Zyzzyva, New American Writing,
Jubilat, Jacket (Australia), Poetry Kanto (Japan), Van Gogh's Ear
(France), Hanging Loose, Exquisite Corpse, and many others. Some

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Folks,

Andy Gricevich here, writing from Madison, Wisconsin. I publish CANNOT EXIST, a little quarterly print poetry magazine.

For the fourth issue of the magazine, I'm trying to get 50 artists (whether they habitually think of themselves as artists or occassionally produce interesting things by accident--or anywhere else along the spectrum) to contribute works that will each grace a single copy of the magazine. These can be paintings, drawings, prints, visual text pieces, photos, very thin sculptures, pages for pop-up books, collages--you name it. An individual artist is welcome to contribute more than one work. My ideal is to have a significant number of these covers be originals (i.e., not copies), so that someone who buys the magazine gets a unique artwork with it.

Details (written quickly--I'm madly preparing to hit the road for a week) are at http://cannotexist.blogspot.com

If you're interested, or have questions, write to me at cantexist@gmail.com.

And feel free to forward this to others who you think might be interested, and who you think would make a good cover.

Submissions of poetry are still open for issue 4 as well, and will remain so until the end of the month, or maybe just after if things keep pouring in. And the first three issues are still available, and still really, really good.

all the best to all of you,

Andy G.

*CALL FOR PAPERS AND WORKS*

On behalf of the scientific committee and Prof. Loss Glazier, President
of the E-poetry Festival, I am glad to inform you about the 5th edition
of the E-Poetry Festival, which will take place in *Barcelona in 2009
(May 24th-27th)* at the Universitat Obertat de Catalunya (UOC) hosted by
the Hermeneia Research Group.

E-Poetry is both a conference and a festival. The festival is the most
significant digital literary gathering in the field. Authors and
researchers worldwide meet and present their researches and works. This
will permit researchers to present their latest research and artists to
premier their newest works. A selection of the papers will be published
after the conference following the peer review system and we will also
like to publish proceedings of the conference. Artistic events will take
place at key Barcelona venues such as the Barcelona Center for
Contemporary Culture (CCCB: http://www.cccb.org/en/
<http://www.cccb.org/en/>), providing authors the opportunity to
present their works to a public curious about new literary and artistic
trends employing technology and communication during the Setmana de la
Poesia, that is also sharing a part of our artistic program.

*Katherine Hayles (Duke), Roberto Simanowski (Brown University) and
Jean Clément (Université Paris 8) have already accepted to be key-note
speakers.*

The UOC's research group Hermeneia with the collaboration of Electronic
Poetry Center (University of Buffalo) and the Laboratoire Paragraph
(Univ. Paris VIII) will organize the event.

You are invited to submit original papers (not presented in other
conferences) and works for the Conference & the Festival.

Please do not hesitate in contacting us for any further information you
may require.

*CALL FOR PAPERS*
Paper topics:

- Close readings of specific works of e-poetry.
- Discussing the terminology: ontologies and definitions of e-poetry
and e-lit forms: a historic approach to e-poetry.
- Relations between e-poetry and other literary and artistic forms and
movements.
- Translating e-poetry
- Recording, presenting, archiving and preserving e-poetry. Devices,
modalities and writing tools.
- Teaching e-poetry: experiences, results and goals.

Abstracts should be in English. Presentations of papers should last no
longer than 20 minutes and should be original.

Researchers and scholars should send an abstract of approximately 500
words before December 1st to hermeneia@uoc.edu

clearly identified. The abstract should be sent to hermeneia@uoc.edu
<mailto:hermeneia@uoc.edu>

2) If the work is published online, the URL at which it is located
should be included in the abstract.

Laura Borràs Castanyer, Professor
Languages and Cultures Studies
Universitat Oberta de Catalunya

Monday November 10
*eNow! presents Tom Raworth*
2:30 pm, Lind Hall 207A
University of Minnesota
Minneapolis
Poet, publisher, and translator since the late Fifties, the English
writer has published over 40 books of poetry and numerous works of
prose. He is also a visual artist, and has collaborated with painters,
photographers, musicians, and book artists. Influenced by the Black
Mountain and New York School poets, he became a major figure in the
experimental British Poetry Revival in the Sixties and Seventies. Among
his recent books are /Caller and Other Pieces/ (Edge) and /Landscaping
the Future/ (Porto dei Santi).

The largest institutional holdings of Bukowski are at the U. of S. CA
(http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/arc/findingaids/bukowski/inventory.html),
Arizona State (http://knet.asu.edu/archives/?getObject=ualib:117308)
and UC Santa Monica.

None of these, however, are CB's official "archive."  It appears he
neither made arrangements to place his papers with any institution,
nor were they brought to market after his death.  My guess is they
remain with his widow.

Hope this helps.

gathered his two donkeys, Alfa and Beto, in front of his home on a recent
Saturday afternoon.

Sweating already under the unforgiving sun, he strapped pouches with the
word "Biblioburro" painted in blue letters to the donkeys' backs and loaded
them with an eclectic cargo of books destined for people living in the small
villages beyond.

His choices included "Anaconda," the animal fable by the Uruguayan writer
Horacio Quiroga that evokes Kipling's "Jungle Book"; some Time-Life picture
books (on Scandinavia, Japan and the Antilles); and the "Dictionary of the
Royal Academy of the Spanish Language."

"I started out with 70 books, and now I have a collection of more than
4,800," said Soriano, 36, a primary school teacher who lives in a small
house here with his wife and three children, with books piled to the
ceilings.

=E2=80=9CThe most cockeyed, twitching, wobbliest gait eventually becomes so=
 ungainly, so weirdly lopsided that it dances. This book would rather linge=

 the French language, my second; I clutter it with l=E2=80=99on-lit and qu=
=E2=80=99on-con, unthinkable infractions, maim it with impossible malaprops=
. I torment and overthrow my other second language, English; I embrace ever=
y solecism, bludgeon with blunders every ear within eyeshot; I merrily redu=
ce the English language to a frenzied shuffle. Or else I unhinge language, =
dislocate it, as though I were a gnome in a museum tilting picture-frames f=
or a good laugh, just enough to discompose the patrons. Aficionados object;=
 campaigns are launched against the crooked: the virtuous demand redress.=

How books are printed: From Letterpress to Print-On-Demand


By Steve Glines

Somerville, Mass.

When I was about ten my grandfather gave me a book he had been saving=20
just for me. It was my first book. I don=92t remember the title or conten=
t but it=20
was a beautiful book, my own book. It had a dust jacket that my grandfath=
er=20
removed and tossed aside to reveal a soft brown leather book with the tit=
le=20
and author embossed in 18 carrot gold on the cover and spine. Both the co=
ver=20
and spine had been tooled with a beautiful border. I thought the spine=20=

especially beautiful. The hide had been glued to a form of cardboard made=
 of=20
cotton fibers and the endpapers of the book itself were glued to the spin=
e=20
with the glue joint covered over with a beautiful hand made gold and gree=
n=20
marbled paper. The body of the book had been printed by letterpress in gi=
ant=20
16 page signatures then sewn into a cloth backing with a Smyth Sewing=20
machine. The first signature of the book, only 4 pages, had been printed =
by=20
engraving and contained the title page with a florid design together with=
 a=20
portrait of the author reminiscent of those found on currency. There was =
a=20
phantom signature of tissue paper between each of the engraved pages to=20=

protect the engravings.=20

You could tell the book had not been opened and read because the signatur=
es=20
had not been cut. The binding process included folding and gathering the=20=

signatures then sewing them into the backing but the resulting signatures=
=20
were not trimmed as they are today. My grandfather ceremoniously handed=20=

me his paper cutter and instructed me to cut the signatures firmly but ge=
ntly.=20
For him learning how to properly open a book was a sacred right of passag=
e.=20
As I slowly sliced the first signature open I could feel the individual c=
otton=20
fibers stretch then break as I drew the dull knife upwards. By the time I=
 had=20
cut the last signature the book had become mine. I would be the first per=
son=20
to set eyes on the printed page since they had come off the press. There =
was=20
magic in that.=20

When I opened the book and looked at the first page in the first signatur=
e I=20
could see the slightly uneven imprint of the type in the soft textured pa=
per.=20
Even without a magnifying glass I could see the needle edge of the types=20=

serifs where it cut into the paper carrying with it the carbon black fill=
ed ink. It=20
was beautiful.=20

Books were made this way for several hundred years. Typesetting was a=20
tedious, expensive and challenging work when done by hand and dangerous=20=

when done by a linotype machine that cast individual lines or slugs of me=
tal=20
type from negatively shaped type masters and hot molten lead. These slugs=
=20
were then printed for proofing on small presses called galley presses. Wh=
en all=20
was well the slugs were then placed in a large 2 x 4 page panel for print=
ing.=20
Two of these were required to print one sixteen page signature. It was a =
slow=20
tedious labor intensive process.=20

Before about 1970 fine, hardbound books were only printed by letterpress.=
 I=20
am old enough to remember when the change occurred. Offset printing was=20=

considered cheep and not worthy of a fine printed book. By 1980 all=20
hardbound books were printed by offset lithography.=20

Offset lithography printing uses a flat metal or plastic sheet called a p=
late that=20
has been photographically prepared so that ink sticks to the image area a=
nd is=20
rejected elsewhere. Ink is transferred from the plate to a roller that pr=
esses=20
into ink into the paper. One of the drawbacks to offset lithography is th=
at the=20
offset plate cannot carry as much ink to the paper or press as hard as a=20=

letterpress. Because of this the paper used in offset printing must be ve=
ry flat=20
and without the =93tooth=94 that characterizes the =93fine=94 papers used=
 in=20
letterpress. When the thin film of ink on an offset roller is pressed aga=
inst the=20
very flat paper, fine lines, dots and type serifs tend to spread so serif=
 type=20
faces printed by offset tend to look a little muddy when compared to iden=
tical=20
type printed by letterpress. This feature of offset printing lead directl=
y to an=20
explosion in the use of san-serif type faces like Helvetica, Universe and=
 others=20
in book design. One good feature of offset printing is the ability to pri=
nt=20
photographs with a resolution many times greater than letterpress offers.=
=20

In older books photographs were often printed individually then glued=20
or =93tipped=94 into the book or entire signatures of photographs or draw=
ings were=20
printed by etching presses then sewn into the book. The maximum resolutio=
n=20
of a letterpress was about 45 dots per inch using newsprint and as much a=
s=20
85 dots per inch using paper specially prepared for the purpose. This pap=
er=20
was often hard and brittle from the clay used to prepare the paper to tak=
e a=20
very sharp image. The harder and flatter the surface the sharper the dots=
=20
could be. Etching presses or rotogravure, are capable of impressions of u=
p to=20
200 dots per inch but this process is very expensive and gravure doesn=92=
t print=20
type very well at all. The colorful magazines distributed with Sunday=20
Newspapers were always printed by rotogravure. That was then; today both=20=

newspapers and the colorful magazines they contain on Sunday are printed =
by=20
offset. Because offset printing was an inexpensive way to print both type=
 and=20
art on the same page it became very popular with textbook publishers. It=20=

didn=92t take long for paperback publishers to switch to offset followed =
quickly=20
by traditional publishers.=20

Not only did the switch to offset represent a revolution in printing at t=
he same=20
time there was a revolution in typesetting. Letterpress printing was a pa=
rt the=20
old industrial revolution characterized by big dirty machines, steam engi=
ne=20
technology. Typesetting was a blue-collar profession conducted in the bow=
ls=20
of a factory. Type was literally hot as the liquid lead flowed down open=20=

channels to form the slug in a linotype machine. In the late 1960=92s =93=
cold type=94=20
became popular. Early =93cold type=94 systems came from IBM Selectric =99=
=20
Typewriters modified to print real typographers=92 fonts onto specially p=
repared=20
paper and Compugraphic =99 and other brands of machines that composed typ=
e=20
onto photographic paper. These galleys would then be used to =93paste-up=94=
 a=20
dummy of the publication which then was then used to photographically=20
create an offset plate.=20

Today, of course, hot type and paste-up is a thing of the past because of=
 the=20
multitude of personal computer programs that can electronically paste-up,=
=20
proof the image on ink jet or laser printers and electronically create an=
 offset=20
plate. Xerox, Hewlett Packard and Kodak all pioneered in the use of ink j=
et and=20
laser as =93page-proof printers=94 with a quality image that rivaled or b=
ettered=20
that produced by an offset press.=20

The best offset printers can print images with a resolution of 300 dots p=
er=20
inch at a rate measuring in the thousands of impressions per minute but a=
n=20
offset pressman might have to print as many as 50 sheets to get the inkin=
g on=20
a plate exactly right before turning up the press. Because of the tuning=20=

required an offset job is cheaper than a proofing press only of the print=
 run=20
exceeds many hundred or thousands of impressions. For many years book=20
publishing has been constrained by the economies of scale in offset print=
ing.=20
For example, printing a 200 page paperback book might cost as much as=20
$2000 to set up and 2 cents per impression. Printing and binding 100 copi=
es=20
could cost $35 or more per book but in quantities of 50,000 the cost fall=
s into=20
the range of pennies per book.=20

Modern proofing presses, for example Hewlett Packard=92s Indigo series of=
=20
industrial laser printers, are capable of printing an 11=94 by 17=94 imag=
es in full=20
color with a resolution of 1200 dots per inch at the rate of up to 1000 p=
ages=20
per minute. The quality of the image produced by these printers is superi=
or to=20
almost all offset printing but cost considerably more than offset at its =
optimum=20
but considerably less than offset in very small quantities. With the=20
introduction of home, commercial and industrial laser printers =93printin=
g on=20
demand=94 was born and =93publishing on demand=94 soon after.=20

Publishers face two dilemmas: First, Can they sell enough books to make=20=

publishing worthwhile? Second, how can publishers keep their back list al=
ive=20
without having to print and stock uneconomical quantities of books? For m=
ost=20
mainstream publishers pre- and post-publication costs dictate an initial =
print=20
run of many thousands of books. These same economics prohibit the=20
publication of books with potentially smaller audiances and prohibit alto=
gether=20
books on the backlist that could have long but active tails. A book by a =
major=20
publisher that might sell 100 =96 300 books a year in perpetuity is quick=
ly marked=20
out of print.=20

=93Publishing on demand,=94 or POD, is a technology that solves the probl=
em of=20
small press runs. POD marries laser proofing technology with conventional=
=20
bindery equipment to create a book production system that is as efficient=
 at=20
printing a one-of book as it is 2,000 books. Of course the unit cost is m=
uch,=20
much higher and the production rate much lower than offset but back liste=
d=20
books that once would have gone out of print can be quickly and effective=
ly=20
produced by a Lulu or Lightning press one at a time at a cost point=20
guaranteed to earn the publisher a profit.=20

To a small to medium sized publisher POD is a revolution. Not only does t=
he=20
use of POD eliminate an investment in inventory but the quality of public=
ation=20
is greater or equal to that produced by offset. The simple elimination of=
 large=20
inventories allows smaller publishers to publish more books than they oth=
erwise=20
could and the availability of POD published works guarantees that no book=
 will=20
ever go out of print. The agility of POD will almost guarantee that new a=
nd=20
exciting works will flow to those publishers who using POD, will be able =
to=20
respond quickly and decisively to the market. By reducing the cost to mar=
ket=20
while maintaining expected quality will insure the publisher using POD wi=
ll have=20
an advantage over their more conventional competition.=20

Yes, at the nth hour!

Thanks, Geraldine.

For those who are in London, I'll also be giving a lecture on what
I've been doing for the last 24 years or so with Chax Press, at the
Birkbeck Research Centre, Univ. of London, 7:30pm on Oct. 29. More
details at

	http://www.bbk.ac.uk/cprc/news/talkscharlesalexander

I'll also be reading in the Crossing The Line reading series in
London on Nov. 6. Please contact Jeff Hilson for details about that.

	J.Hilson@roehampton.ac.uk

On Nov. 5 I'll be lecturing at the Univ. of Sussex. Please contact
Daniel Kane for details:

	djk5474@gmail.com

 From the night of Oct. 30, until Nov. 3 or 4, I'll be hanging out at
the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. If anybody around there
is on this list and wants to get together, please send me an email.
During the trip away from Tucson, though, I may have spotty reception/
checking of email, at best. I look forward to meeting lots of people
in the UK, as well as seeing old friends. I'll be back in Tucson on
Nov. 8, though perhaps jetlagged until Nov. 9.

best wishes,

Charles

"While physicists at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland,
seek to discover the mechanism by which energy acquires mass, Chace's
Scaffold, with its words hung in space like particulates of a universe
trembling at the threshold of creation, perpetually hovering between
absence and presence, initiates an inquiry into the dynamics of
speech. How do words acquire mass? Weight? Dimension? Density? Chace
pins it down to the "lip's loom." This is a true radium of the word."

--John Olson


"Scaffold, so aptly titled, offers readers an arrangement on which to
climb up and over and around its seen/read/heard words in a
pleasurably unnerving way=97for we start out, at least, reading/climbing
down, not up=97and life is like that, all evidence to the contrary.  I
imagine even falling off this Scaffold would be a wholly fascinating
experience."

Subject:      Second Life Installation Phenomenology (please post)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Second Life Installation Phenomenology


The Second Life show at http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22
continues to change; since it's complex and interactive, it makes sense
for you to visit it. The images and videos I put up almost daily can
present one or another new (static or dynamic) topographic feature, but
only in an isolated and framed configuration; one doesn't get a sense of
the roil or negotiated pathways of the spaces which are always under
construction.

At one point symmetries dominated, as well as moire patterns related to
early cinema; at another, flat black areas created a problematic of depth
that remained unresolved. At times a machine-structure (gears, wheels,
cams) appeared out of partial assemblages; at best, these were metaphors,
doing nothing in the virtual or the real. In the exhibition, objects tend
to ignore one another unless given physical weight; few objects have that,
since those that do tend to tumble out of the exhibition, 'out of world,'
ending up in lost-and-found inventories.

Now the symmetries have corroded by 'foreign' non-repetitive textures that
indicate movement trajectories (it's easy to follow the movement of a flat
black square for example) and block moire effects. It's as if the symmet-
rical properties of objects and assemblages are falling apart. Almost
every object moves vertically; some are aligned, some are harmonic, some
appear independent. It's easy to fall vertically at this point, from sky
objects to the exhibition hall surface, and from ground surface to the
underwater environment beneath the hall. Teleport labels may or may not
take you somewhere; you might end up where you started or even more en-
tangled on a different level. The environment as a whole appears as shaky
as the economy, and there's a parallel with bandwidth and prim quantity
issues. I build and don't know who sees what; I find my own computers
locked up on occasion.

At this point I want to start radically modifying the installation; again
I urge you to visit while it retains a semblance of its current state. As
objects are given weight, they'll fall and reorganize the surface; they
may well pile up without falling out of world, at least temporarily; they
may provide new surfaces and cavities to negotiate. It's almost impossible
to document the dynamics of this; things fall too fast for cameras to
follow.

When I sleep at night, spaces open up; I'm torn and brought close to death
in nightmare after nightmare, some of which are set in apparently real
environments that slough off into the virtual. A train begins here, the
tracks connect there, leading to dilapidated and jumbled architecture. Or
arousal which disseminates in the midst of prims sharp enough to slice
through site and sound. From Dhananjaya: "'Rasa is that which is made
enjoyable by the behaviour of the characters that gives enjoyment because
the object of the drama is not to enjoy the behaviour of the characters
since that belongs to the past.' (Otherwise, says the author, the specta-
tor might as well himself fall into love with the heroine." And again:
"The spectators enjoy at the site of characters like Arjuna and others
what they themselves feel inside just as children enjoy, playing with clay
elephants, the fervour that is within themselves." (From Adya Rangacharya,
Drama in Sanskrit Literature, Bombay, Popular Prakashan, 1968.) Enjoyment
is not enjoyment in the sense of pleasure, but inhabiting a diegetic cons-
tructed through a series of coded interfaces. In the Second Life instal-
lation, the strange remains strange, but one learns to negotiate complex
trajectories among levels, prims, sounds, spaces, worlds; soon rasa
(flavor among other meanings) emerges as one's eyes are one's avatar's
eyes and one becomes comfortable with hir body. There are no identifica-
tions in the Second Life show, only corners, plateaus, and circulations
that permit discourse, that one might conceivably inhabit. All of these
spaces, like capital, are rickety; Second Life is governed by exchange,
not use value and things constantly threaten to fall apart. The only
certainty is an absence of breakage and death; what is attached for the
most part remains attached, no matter how far it falls, no matter how
sharp and difficult, impossible, the landing. Death in Second Life is
never death, but literally a passing-away; an avatar disappears more or
less permanently and one might assume that something has occurred in real
life parallel to this - illness or death or disinterest or bankruptcy -
one never knows.

The spaces in exhibition are malleable, not liquid, not liquid architec-
ture so much as capable of distortion and linkage at a distance: things
may well move in synchronization, even over a fairly large distance, as if
Bell's theorem suddenly appeared in the large and abstract. When the space
- the normative space of Second Life - fills up, it transforms the avatar
within it. Boundaries are no longer fixed or even apparent. I imagine a
Kristevan chora, part-objects and pre-linguistics driving the show, as if
the birth of language were imminent and immanent. The birth never occurs;
the chora remains at the state of the laugh or scream or orgasm or even
free-fall. One is stripped down, and the images, such as they are, textur-
ing the prims are often sexualized - penises, breasts, rings, faces in
pain or ecstasy, posed mannequins of fossilized desire and dance. One
senses an alien choreography behind everything, the world inverted in
Plato's cave from virtual shadows to the watching and participating body
on the damp floor. The alien is ourselves of course and the aliens are our
self, chora to chiasm.

Rasa is the taste of this, the taste or flavor of the enlightened audience
which means the knowledgeable audience, who have already migrated past the
strangeness of the exhibition towards an inhering organic that passes for
flesh and tissue. I think of the space as avatar body, as avatar hirself,
as chora, as womb, as phallus, as adverb. I think of rocketing through the
space as the dissipation of vectors without origin and destination; one
lands in the midst of circulation and circles hirself.

But all of this takes time on the part of the visitor, as does the reading
of signs, even the writing and writhing of signs in sky and water and
within the earth itself. One has to enter the space, ascend and descend,
allow oneself to be caught up in the multiplicity of worlds, even the
smoke of catastrophe and catastrophic industrialization, the destruction
of families, speech and phenomena which are always already in a state of
withdrawal. The world comes and goes without saying; we pass away as it
passes by, and even a minute after our death we no longer hear a voice,
see the sun, read the next day's market.

**Subpress Collective
http://www.durationpress.com/subpress/
=20
=B3Subpress popped off a Listserv one day and began to take shape and grow in
another Listserv, specially created for it. That is, in the course of casua=
l
griping about how no one could get their book published, or about fellow
poets growing weary while watching their manuscripts age, suggestions were
made that we publish books ourselves. The discussion evolved quickly into
process and finances.

=B3At the moment Subpress is a dozen poets spread across the US, France and
England. Our communication is, and always has been, conducted by email. I
have never met some of my fellow-editors in person.

=B3We began by agreeing to contribute our own money to a bank account.
Everyone threw in one percent of their gross annual income. The disparity
was wide but people agreed it was fair. We figured we had enough money to
publish a certain amount of books per year. Because that number was less
than the number of editors (18 editors at that time) we agreed to spread ou=
t
our first publishing round over three years.

=B3Each editor was allotted equal funds to edit, design, and produce one book
in that first cycle. Editors with different skills for typesetting,
designing, etc., volunteered their time to help when help was asked for.
There were no editorial requirements or standards for choosing a book. Ther=
e
was no vote or veto process for whatever title an editor brought to press.
There were no limitations on design or print specifications except those
created by one's budget.=B2=8BDaniel Bouchard
=20
=20
*Performer Bios*
=20
**Steve Carey
=20
Subpress co-editor Anselm Berrigan will present work by poet Steve Carey,
whose book Berrigan and his brother Edmund are editing for Subpress.
=20
=B3Steve's books are very hard to find, but include The California Papers
(United Artists), Gentle Subsidy (Big Sky), Smith Going Backwards (Cranium
Press), and 20 Poems. Alice Notley's book of essays Coming After contains a
memoir/essay on Steve, and the Up Late anthology edited by Andrei Codrescu
has, I believe, a few of his poems. Steve's poetry is hard to describe, but
I want to say, and so will, that a title like Gentle Subsidy in and of
itself gives a sense of his predilection, one of several at least, for word
combinations=8Ba really delicate consonant balance, if such a thing makes
sense. And a great sense of humor, love of song (he was a drummer and could
play guitar) and companionship, and weirdness (of a mostly non-threatening
kind, but you=B9d have to figure that out yourself). He was like this huge gu=
y
who wouldn't harm a soul, with a deep voice and ability to loom. Bob Newhar=
t
and Jimi Hendrix and Philip Whalen. His dad is Harry Carey Jr., the actor i=
n
many of John Ford's films, and so Steve was a Cali kid from the 1950s who
spent time in New York in the 1960s a bit then moved to NYC permanently in
the late 1970s. Brother of poet Tom Carey. Steve died in 1989.=B2 =8BAnselm
Berrigan
=20
=20
**Brett Evans
=20
Greg Fuchs will present work by Brett Evans, professor of English at Delgad=
o
Community College in New Orleans, and author of Subpress=B9 After School
Session, edited by Fuchs.
=20
=B3After School Session is a generous and brassy cull of correspondence from
Brett Evans to Buck Downs. The poems are a direct jack into the miniamp of
postcard art sent between two friends; they hit hard in an open-all-night
punk rock show for the audience of one. Like the form of Kerouac's Mexico
City Blues, limited by the small size of a breastpocket notebook, Evans's
gumbo is cooked in the scant pot of the postcard--an "afterschool rest stop
of the imagination / real special." The poems offer one slamming and dammin=
g
notation after another. Down's artful arrangement and selection should stan=
d
as a model for what one can do with our hazardous mail.=B2 =8BTom Devaney



**I Feel Tractor
http://www.myspace.com/ifeeltractor
http://www.goodbyebetter.com/
=20
I Feel Tractor is available to you with musings of space folk and cut ups. =
I
Feel Tractor has a self-titled 7=B2 from the Loudmouth Collective, and a CD,
Once I Had an Earthquake, from Goodbye Better.
=20
=20
**Denize Lauture
=20
Denize Lauture, first born of 13 peasant children, migrated to the U.S. fro=
m
Haiti in 1968. He is a professor of French and Spanish at St Thomas Aquinas
College in Sparkill and lives in the Bronx. Lauture writes in Creole,
English, and French. He is the author of Blues of the Lightning
Metamorphosis, Father and Son, Running the Road to ABC, Mothers and
Daughters, The Curse of the Poet, When the Denizen Weeps, and Subpress=B9 The
Black Warrior and Other Poems, edited by Fuchs
=20
=20
**My Invisible
http://www.myspace.com/myinvisible
=20
=B3Put aside your preconceived notions of a chamber-instrument ensemble.
Neither aloof nor pretentious, Providence's My Invisible maintains a
punk-rock subversiveness while gleefully coloring outside the lines of genr=
e
limitations. They're wry changelings, equally at home crafting waltz-time
laments as they are writing off-the-cuff paeans to their favorite Detroit
Piston. They even have their own cheer.
=20
=B3Fittingly, its easier to define them by what they aren=B9t than by what they
are, given that their very name evokes a kind-of absence by design. Neither
drawing-room prim or Gothic kitsch (see: Rasputina), their music although
not rock by any stretch flirts with the same quiet/loud dichotomy first
patented by the Pixies, and to equally stirring effect. Exploiting negative
as well as positive space, the band shapes gripping music, sometimes out of
thin air.
=20
=B3You can hear it on their self-released debut, My Invisible, but its even
more pronounced during their vibrant live show, in which the blend of cello=
,
violin, guitar, Roxy (an antique instrument), pick-up percussion, and
intricate harmonies intertwine to create something that=B9s hard to pin down.
Searching for influences, one hears echoes of the Slits percussive,
ramshackle humor, of This Heats haunting complexity, of Dirty Threes
sun-drenched expansiveness. And if that sounds complicated, embodying all
sorts of seemingly contradictory impulses is part of My Invisible=B9s
considerable charm..." =8BAndrea Feldman, The Phoenix

later recorded another=2C and then another=3B until it was suggested that I
gather them into a book.

had been aware for a quite some time that I was doing more than

as an item in the memory box=2C placed alongside the first baby-grows and

a female writer=2C writing in a way that foregrounds motherhood=2C I
believe that I have also been articulating something of the unsaid
feminine. I have recently been guided to Mary Kelly=92s Postpartum

collaged life of women who choose to create and procreate=92. That
particular work has been critiqued by many but it is when Mary
describes the Document as =91the rationalisation of a difficult

find myself smiling and releasing an exuberant =91Hear=2C Hear=92.

=93The Man in the Booth in the Midtown Tunnel" goes to Endicott College=20=


I was invited to give a workshop for my poetry collection =93The Man in t=
he=20
Booth in the Midtown Tunnel=94 by an unusual man, Dan Sklar. Dan Sklar is=
 the=20
Creative Writing Director at Endicott College in Beverly, Mass. Dan has t=
urned=20
into a great supporter of the small press in the Boston area. There are t=
oo few=20
colleges, universities, that welcome little magazines and small presses, =
and=20
because of Dan, many poets who would not have been heard by many=20
students, are given a voice. Besides the Cape Cod Writers Center headed b=
y=20
the gracious Ann Elizabeth Tom, and Michael Sullivan of the William Joine=
r=20
Center at U/Mass/Boston, and a few select others, Sklar is a major solid=20=

citizen. Sklar, of course is a widely published small press poet and prob=
ably=20
mentions his credits in Free Verse and Ibbetson Street more than he menti=
ons=20
his publications in the Harvard Review, and other top shelf mags. When yo=
u go=20
out to Endicott, Sklar treats everyone the same. Whether you are a big de=
al=20
poet with a Pulitzer, or you are putting out a stapled chapbook with a=20=

minipress, well, Sklar digs you=85as long as the work works for him. I te=
ll Dan=20
whenever I go out to Endicott I feel like a mensch, a distinguished poet,=
=20
instead of an extinguished one. Hats off to this guy and buy his latest=20=

book =93Bicycles, Canoes, and Drums=94

*I included some remarks that I made to his class about =93The Man in the=
=20
Booth in the Midtown Tunnel=94 (Cervena Barva Press):

There are some people who are nature poets, there are language poets,=20
metaphysical poets, and you name it. I guess I can call myself a peoples=92=
 poet.=20
I write mostly about people=97character studies, if you will. I guess it =
goes back=20
to when I was a kid watching the Twilight Zone=97you know the original in=
 black=20
and white. Rod Serling, the host, would introduce some character, a guy,=20=

down-on-his-luck, maybe a reclusive bookworm, a snake oil salesman, in a=20=

gone-to-seed hotel room, with the requisite neon sign blinking garishly o=
utside=20
his window. Serling would introduce him: =93Have if you will Mr. Henry Be=
amish, a=20
small fastidious man whose only passion is the written word.=94

To me, often people on the margin have been a source of fascination. I ha=
ve=20
worked a s a counselor at a psych. hospital, McLean Hospital, for 26 year=
s=20
now, and I guess for some reason I was attracted to the =93craziness=94 o=
f the=20
ward, over the =93craziness=94 of the outside world. When we discharge cl=
ients=20
from the program I work now, I often joke; =93I haven=92t been discharged=
 yet,=20
and won=92t be anytime soon.=94 A good portion of the work I have produce=
d has=20
dealt with the often overlooked denizens of the back ward, and the people=
 I=20
have encountered in bars, coffee shops, and subways, etc=85 in=20
Boston/Cambridge/Somerville.

In my life, and I am sure in yours, there has always been a person, who=20=

remains a strong symbol, an icon for you, a flashing light, on this journ=
ey we=20
all take. So when I wrote: =93The Man in the Booth in the Midtown Tunnel,=
=94 I=20
concentrated on a man I saw in a small booth in the middle of the Midtown=
=20
Tunnel when I was a kid. The tunnel connects the borough of Queens to the=
=20
borough of Manhattan. The booth and the man are long gone, but the booth=20=

hasn=92t given up the ghost. Now as a middle age man, probably around the=
=20
same age as the guy in the booth, I realized this man represented encroac=
hing=20
adulthood: the trip from the relative security of a Long Island childhood=
, to an=20
unknown, alluring, yet frightening adult world. Did this man have a wife,=
=20
friends, a life outside the booth, I asked my Dad. My father confused as =
to=20
why I was fixated on this obscure figure said: =93How the hell do I know?=
=94=20
When I was on the skids, I retreated to a booth of my own making, whether=
 a=20
cubicle in a dark library, or the small furnished room I lived in the Bac=
k Bay of=20
Boston for many years. We emerge and submerge in metaphorical tunnels. We=
=20
emerge from the vaginal tunnel towards the light and cry, later we reente=
r=20
that tunnel and die. We have many rites of passage. All I know is, wherev=

I, too, came up in the era of letter-press books, and linotype newspapers=

When offset=20

960s, I worked=20
nights at a cold-type house in New York City, typesetting (which was real=
ly typing on IBM=20
Executive typewriters) and "stripping in" corrections at a light table. T=
his was before the=20
"Selectric Composer" and there was no way to change typefaces. We had spe=
cial italic=20
machines, and would strip in all the itals in a text, as well as smaller =
fonts for footnote=20
numbers, etc.

Armed with this experience and the help of a less than ten more well-off =
artists (painters,=20
mostly) I bought a Fairchild Davidson Offrset Press secondhand, took a we=
ek-long course=20
that came free with the purchase, and started Poets Press in 1964.

I've been amazed and excited as each technological advance made publishin=

text, which=20

Another difficulty with POB, unless there's a substantial first printing:=
 when a small poetry=20
"came out" there was usually a substantial run: at least 500 copies. (Aft=
er the first Poets=20
Press book, A.B. Spellman's "The Beautiful Day", which had a run of 750 c=
opies, we never=20
did less than 1000 copies, and after the first four books most first prin=

Diane - a privilege to talk with you.

I too have produced books and scads of printed material and find it
difficult to read a book which is below par in production qualities. But I
have Sheila Murphy's Collected Chapbooks recently, and, even though it is
from a different publisher, I obtained it from LULU publishing - who seem t=
o
produce books and do the marketing work for some other publishers. If this
book is POD I'm very surprised at its quality. None of the usual hallmarks
of such production are visible and the quality of print and stock is high
class. Does anybody know more about LULU? (And don't break into song, all
you fellow sexagenarians and older.)

POD books have gotten a lot better, Diane--still not with same physical qua=
lity as I would like, but acceptable. I just recently received a pile of bo=
oks from BlazeVOX, for instance, and they don't have any of the problems yo=
u mention, even though there is still a certain material "solidity" that I =
find lacking. Mainly the paper is not as heavy and opaque as I would like. =
But perhaps this reflects budgetary constraints more than the technology it=
self. I can also mention that Salt and Shearsman put out decent quality POD=
 paperbacks.=0A=0AOn the other hand, I would have a concern about that sens=
e that the book is "out there." And I also agree that there is a positive a=
spect of a book being able to go out of print. That is what allows for a ne=

*Two adorable things about Mozart*

* *

*                        *First: he's straight into it. No preamble

                        ever, as if he's saying: there's plenty more

                        where that came from. You can bank on it.



                        And secondly: how he drags something

                        like heavy fabric, like a train behind him

                        up stone stairs to a window with a view of graves.

Eugene Ostashevsky is a Russian-born American                 poet from New=
 York City. His debut poetry collection, Iterature,
displays the dissonant rhythms, heavy unexpected rhymes and
multilingual puns that occupied him at the turn of the century, as well
as a healthy interest in mathematics. His new book from UDP, The Life      =
           and Opinions of DJ Spinoza,
employs characters such as MC Squared, Peepeesaurus, the Begriffon and,
of course, DJ Spinoza, to explore the shortcomings of axiomatic systems
with the insouciance and energy of Saturday-morning cartoons. He has
edited an English-language anthology of Russian absurdist writings of
the 1930s by such authors as Alexander Vvedensky and Daniil Kharms. His
PhD dissertation was on the history of zero. He teaches the humanities
at New York University.

Talk Series - Robert Grenier on Larry Eigner

Robert Grenier looks forward to presenting an account of his relation with
poet Larry Eigner (beginning w/ a visit to the Eigner home at 23 Bates Road=
,
Swampscott, Mass. in early January 1971, on to LE's 3 readings/classroom
visits at Franconia College in northern New Hampshire where RG was teaching
in the 70's, then to the 10 years RG lived in a household w/ & took care of
LE in Berkeley in the 80's) & of his work over the years w/ LE establishing
authoritative texts of some 1800 poems & editing 3 books, leading to RG's
current project of editing (w/ Curtis Faville) a Collected Poems of Larry
Eigner for the Stanford University Press. A number of Eigner typescripts
from different periods of LE's work will be made available to evidence an
amazing & various achievement (in the space/field of the page, w/ the
typewriter as instrument) & RG will discuss the present state of the
Collected Poems undertaking (including the editorial approach guiding the
task) w/ everyone present who may wish to participate.

A Helen Adam Halloween

Halloween time is a good Helen Adam time. Adam's work inspired many poets,
such as Robert Duncan and Jack Spicer, to explore the ballad. This event is
to celebrate the publication of A Helen Adam Reader (National Poetry
Foundation, 2008) edited by Kristin Prevallet. Songsters who will conjure
Adam through her ballads are: Anne Waldman, Edmund Berrigan, Dan Machlin an=
d
Serena Jost, Franklin Bruno and Bree Benton, Cecilia Vicu=F1a, Julie Patton,
Tracie Morris, Lee Ann Brown, Charles Bernstein, Bob Hershon, Susan Howe an=
d
Bob Holman. This event is co-presented with Poets House.


Friday, October 31, 10 PM
HALLOWEEN!

This Halloween, the Parish Hall will be inhabited by ghosts of the past.
Poets and performers of the present will take on the specters, mannerisms,
clothes, and yes, poems and songs, of your favorites from yesteryear. The
siamese twins, Sylvia Plath and Charles Bukowski, may make an appearance,
while the two-personed Arthur Russell could break out his cello and play a
tune or two from 'World Of Echo'. Of course we've all been waiting for Alle=
n
Ginsberg, Kathy Acker, Frank O'Hara and Emily Dickinson to return. Ed
Sanders coming face to the face with The Fuggs is not beyond reason and
Sappho could even show up to show off her soul at this show! Please join
guest host Ben Malkin of So L'il for this haunted and certainly magical
evening. Come dressed as an other, living or gone.

Hey, this is an interesting discussion. I was just in Italy talking =20
with Caterina Davinio, whom I met on this list, and she suggested I =20
look into LULU. And she also directed me to YouTube, to show my =20
videos. I am curious to see about this, since my Concrete Poetry in =20
France (1981) is out of print but still an oft-cited source (it has =20
lots of footnotes), and I wonder if there is a way to  get it back =20
into print.

Meanwhile, I have to cite my Lettrist colleagues, who say that =20
production values are a distraction from the essence, which is the =20
creativity. This did not mollify me when I looked at dittoes and =20
mimeograph journals. And yet, isn't the creative act the most =20
important part?

Interesting "reading" of music.

I like the kinesic idea of "going straight into it."
Motion in music; music as motion.
Movement: move meant.

And this MozARTistic kinesic also stirs an imagination of the visual -- the
dragging of "something like heavy fabric.../up stone stairs...."

Art analyzing art, inhabiting art.

Good sample for discussion on music-poetry dialogism.

I agree with you. I find this poem incredibly perfect in its briefness,
visual imagery, distillation of Mozart and concise summary of Mozart's life
and heritage. The same Mozart is present and absent at the same time -
reference could be made to Barthes' studies. The poem implies much of the
imagery I confer to his music and the way I perceive his personality
(different from the one depicted in the movie that came out several years
ago). Music is better expressed in poetry than through visual images that
collide with the mental impulses we receive and transform into a personal
sort of dream-like undefined ensemble of colored waves.

Going back to lit. crit. I find myself at ease with Derrida in appreciating
this poem. The way by which the words acquire essential meaning in a sort of
imprevu and with the utmost simplicity (First [...], Secondly [...] which
also scan the musical time in two stanzas), and directly comprehensible to a
contemporary audience (You can bank on it) requires a longstanding ovation.

BRAVO !

every aspect of a book, or any other media, can be approached 'creatively'.

one of the things i like about much of the lettristic works i've seen is
they often seem more deeply informed concerning visual art than is usually
the case with visual writing.

a book or any other media involves, or can involve, several senses, several
arts, fields, different aspects, every way it can touch us, reach us,
communicate.

so that a work can be lettristic yet beyond solely the letter, even while
remaining solely of the letter.

Call for Papers


Why Are You Laughing?: Humour in Experimental Poetry

A Special Issue of Open Letter Guest-Edited by Jonathan Ball and Ryan =
Fitzpatrick



A common complaint of poetry pundits is that experimental poetry tends =
to entail a humourless flaunting of critical theory. Yet within this =
field, there are a number of poets that make use of humour as a literary =
tactic. How exactly is humour used in experimental poetry and what are =
its effects? In what ways could we theorize humour in terms of poetry =
and language in general? Is humour useful as a destabilizing device, or =
is it politically benign? Can humour make difficult poetry more =
accessible to a general readership, or does it provide an excuse to =
dismiss this work?



We are seeking submissions of essays for a special issue of Open Letter =
regarding these issues. Possible topics could include (but are limited =
to):



  a.. humour and pop culture references in poetry
  b.. irony and/or the failure of irony
  c.. the absurd in poetry
  d.. humour as a coping mechanism
  e.. political uses of humour
  f.. humour as an attack on authority
  g.. shock humour and its poetic value
  h.. specific schools or movements for whom humour is an important tool


Please send proposals (300-500 words) by January 1, 2009. If proposals =
are accepted, then final papers will be due June 1, 2009. Submit in the =
body of an e-mail to either jonathan@jonathanball.com or =
rcfmod@gmail.com.=20

Am wondering if anyone might have a Noon #4 they would be interested in selling. While having work appearing in this issue, and loving this wonderful publication put together by Phillip Rowland, I have managed to give all of my copies away as gifts. Too, the issue is, naturally, out of print.

An apology if this seems moderately out of place.

In the past several months, I have been making "haptic" drawings in respons=
e to
poets reading their works in public.=A0 I tend to let the pen move in respo=
nse to the contours, rhythms
and levels of a pitch in a poets voice. The movement of the pen is a
way of =A1dancing=A2 with the work - as well as responding -=A0 as it is em=
bodied by the poet=A2s voice.
There is nothing specifically narrative about process - the pen can
take off from any part of the page, can layer back and forth across
itself, etc. The "haptic"=A0 becomes a unique way of manifesting a poem and
poet=A2s presence, as distinct in its own way as a still photograph, a
video and/or an audio recording. A haptic is a kind of cardiograph of
the process, much in the manner that Philip Whalen talks about the poem
as a moving graph, etc. All of these works are
done with a Faber Castell India Ink brush pen, often in combination
with Micron hard-point pens of different guages (=A2fine=A2, =A1medium=A2,
etc). If some of it looks familiar, the pieces have been periodically hoste=
d on my=A0 blog; I thought it might be advantageous for comparative reasons=
 to create
this little anthology with some commentary, some not. Poets include
Taylor Brady, Rob Halpern, Philip Lamantia (as rendered by Brian Lucas,
Andrew Joron, Neeli Cherkovski, Adam Cornford, & J. Vale), Chad Lietz,
Judith Goldman, Aaron Shurin, Joanne Kyger and Ann Waldman.

Delving further down in recent blog history will show pieces derived from b=
oth live and recorded musians.

As always, I appreciate any feedback, well, most feedback!

The Bone was first printed as a chapbook in 1997.   The process removed all
the words from Clement Greenberg's article Avant-Garde and the Kitsch (1939)
what was revealed was a long concrete poem. The bones are a struncture and
they are also thrown to the dogs.  Remind you of our election, and  many
other  processes, and just as easy to read.

 Performances of the piece:  Beyond Test Festival 2002 Beyond Baroque and
Bowery Poetry Project as punctuation performance in 2005.

The Chapel is located at the far north end of the 5th floor.   The space is
open for viewing when the building is open to the public-Monday-Saturday 9-6
pm. Thursday night until 9 pm.  It is 180 sq ft. with one large arched
window and an exit sign.

TINFISH 18.5: THE BOOK: POETRY, PUZZLES AND GAMES

TINFISH 18.5: THE BOOK introduces five young poets from Hawai`i in a
format modeled after the word puzzles and games books people carry onto
airplanes as they go on vacation.  Vacations and games are both
respites from practical preoccupations; many people come to Hawai`i for
their vacation.  But there is another Hawai`i, too, one well known to
its residents.  This Hawai`i is riven by historical and ethnic
conflicts, drug adiction, homelessness, economic downturns,
environmental problems, and the near extinction of the Hawaiian
language in the 20th century.  The poets included here all write about
these stern facts in beautiful poems, a paradox that befits the place
itself.  This interactive book is illustrated by five exceptional
artists.  $15 from Tinfish Press or Small Press Distribution (spdbooks.org).

insistence on transforming a given state of affairs." - Charles

Although 'driven by a different engine', your 'haptic' works, aeshetically
at least, are reminiscent of the works of the 'Tachist' artists of the 50's
and 60's such as Henri Michaux or Mark Tobey, although their drawings and
paintings were either drug-inspired or spiritually driven, they had that
same spontaneity of the line, which to some extent Jackson Pollock's 'action
paintings also espoused. I imagine that as you develop these works more, a
greater distinction will emerge between the rhythms and cadences of the
different poets you engage with and perhaps more punctuation (visual) and
counterpoint.  I like the energy of these works, and their apparent
portability and accessibility. Keep it going.  I would be interested to know
the responses of the poets featured here.

Roy Exley.

Call Me Waiter. Joseph Torra.  (Pressed Wafer 9 Columbus Sq. Boston, MA $=
10)

Review by Doug Holder

=20

Joe Torra, poet, writer, and publisher, has lived down the block from me =
in=20
Somerville, Mass. for many years. For the longest time I have heard about=
 his=20
literary accomplishments, be it his critically-acclaimed novel =93Gas Sta=
tion,=94 his=20
literary journal =93lift,=94 his numerous poetry collections, etc=85 When=
 I asked him=20
what he was doing for a living he always told me that he was a waiter.=20=

Recently though Torra, a man in his 50=92s, is now teaching at U/Mass Bos=
ton.

=20

Now Torra and I have a few things in common. We are contemporaries, and=20=

like him I have always been involved in the writing life in one shape or =
form.=20
Like Torra, I had many jobs that afforded me the time to write. I was nev=
er a=20
waiter, but I worked as a dishwasher at the long-defunct Ken=92s Deli in =
Copley=20
Square, Boston in the 70=92s, and I was a short order cook at the =93Fatt=
ed Calf=94=20
in Boston, where I flipped burgers, and appointed little balls of cheese =
on the=20
bloody pucks of meat. So I know what it is like to work in the food indus=
try=20
and it ain=92t easy.

=20

Torra, has written a memoir =93Call Me Waiter,=94 that recalls his many y=
ears as a=20
server and his struggle to establish himself as a writer. The waiter jobs=
 he had=20
were transient, grueling, often well-paid, and most importantly provided =
him=20
with the flexibility to write. Torra writes of his slow ascent as a write=
r, and his=20
vocation as a means to an end:

=20

=93My poetry was bringing a modicum of success and that is where I would =
put=20
my energy. Poems were being accepted by various little magazines. After=20=

reading at the Word of Mouth, I also gave readings around the city.=20
Friendships developed with writers I came in contact with.  If it took wo=
rking=20
shifts in a restaurant at night to support this life, so be it.=94

=20

Torra goes into detail not only about his working life, but also about th=
e=20
subculture of restaurants: the gay waiters, the alcoholic managers, the=20=

sociopath cooks, the parade of grad students, artists, musicians, support=
ing=20
their lifestyle, and pocketing tips. In this passage Torra describes the =
typical=20
reaction when he tells people at work that he is a writer:

=20

=93I=92m always bemused at the way they react when they find out I am a w=
riter.=20
It shouldn=92t come as any surprise. There are probably more artists in t=
he=20
restaurant business, pound for pound, than any other industry, I=92ve wor=
ked=20
with jazz, rock, folk and classical musicians, sculptures, dancers, femal=
e=20
impersonators, actor, singers, photographers, poets and novelists=97I eve=
n=20
worked with a guy who painted with spoons. Why else, they must wonder,=20=

would someone my age be doing this=85?

=20

I tell them . They look puzzled. If I publish novels what am I doing here=
? I=20
attempt an abridged account of the publishing industry. They=92re bewilde=
red.=20
Then a friendly grin, perhaps they figured it out=97I can=92t be much of =
a writer if=20
I publish books and tend bar for a living.=94

=20

At the end of the memoir Torra realizes that he is at the end of the line=
 with=20
being a waiter, and cuts himself loose. Although frightened, he enjoyed a=
=20
sense of freedom:

=20

=93I have no idea where I am headed, what the future holds. Images of wor=
king=20
all night as a shelf stocker, a cab driver or variety store clerk cross m=
y mind. I=20
know I must remain out of the business no matter what it takes. Something=
 is=20
out there for me. Standing on bike pedals to stretch my legs, I feel like=
 I am=20
floating.=94

=20

=93Call Me Waiter=94 is one of the better books I have read about the wri=
ting life.=20
Torra has a workman-like style, that lays out the consuming need to write=
,=20
and the need to support it anyway you can=97no matter what, in a straight=
, no=20
chaser fashion. Torra, born to a blue collar family in Medford, Mass brin=
gs a=20
work ethic to his life and art that is a refreshing change from all the L=
eft Bank,=20
Iowa Writers Workshop stuff that lines the bookshelves.

=20

Highly recommended.

I too have experienced first-hand the inconsistent quality of
print-on-demand books (including my own!). I wonder, though, if we can start
to think creatively about how to design books so that when they are printed
on demand (e.g. without some human controlling their quality), they still
come out well. Ideas for how this can be achieved? Maybe just doing
extremely plain covers, more like Gallimard Editions books? I'd love to hear
your thoughts.

Wonderful post! I'll get the book. And save the post to share with my
writing community.

This reminded me of the early 1990s back in Bengal when I began to write
poetry. Rather unusual, the only contemporary poet I could befriend happened
to be a young farmer. He lived in a remote village and came from a family of
10 people crammed in a little hut. The household made $800 annually. For a
third of the year they could afford one paltry meal and one snack a day.
This guy was shaping out to be a family rebel wanting to opt out of a
farmer's life for some kind of technical school. It was strange indeed for
someone like me, fairly upper middle class & sinfully urban, to bond with a
country mouse like him. His poetry reeked of an intensely powerful innocence
which I might have broken my head against, but was never to come.

A common friend visited his country farm once. His father was sick that
morning, so he had to take the plow-cattle to the field. It had rained the
whole week. The fields were muddy. The common friend asked if he could be of
any help. If he could take off his shoes and join him in the fields ?
(Indian farmers usually go barefeet into the fields)

The guy thought for a second and said - "Why don't you go to the country
store, buy something for the peahen (the only other living stock in the
farm)? She hasn't eaten anything past three days. Besides, we had cobras in
the field. Two of my neighbors died last week. You are a guest, so ...."

Our common friend fed the peahen and left the farm.

This young man didn't complete technical school. He went back to his farm
which remains as wretched as it was back then. The parents are gone. Passed
away. So are the two old birth-blind aunts. The guy married. Had a son.
There are 6 people now instead of 10. Living in a 800 sq. ft cottage. He
still writes, has authored 5 books of poetry since then. The last time he
wrote to me he said -"The non-expectant life of an Indian farmer has at
least brought me a rare joy. The joy of living to write. Anything I write is
surely more valuable than my own life, anything I earn from writing can buy
me something I can't otherwise buy."

The cobras still rule the fields in the monsoon.

Call Me Waiter. Joseph Torra.  (Pressed Wafer 9 Columbus Sq. Boston, MA $10)

Review by Doug Holder



Joe Torra, poet, writer, and publisher, has lived down the block from me in
Somerville, Mass. for many years. For the longest time I have heard about
his
literary accomplishments, be it his critically-acclaimed novel "Gas
Station," his
literary journal "lift," his numerous poetry collections, etc. When I asked
him
what he was doing for a living he always told me that he was a waiter.
Recently though Torra, a man in his 50's, is now teaching at U/Mass Boston.



Now Torra and I have a few things in common. We are contemporaries, and
like him I have always been involved in the writing life in one shape or
form.
Like Torra, I had many jobs that afforded me the time to write. I was never
a
waiter, but I worked as a dishwasher at the long-defunct Ken's Deli in
Copley
Square, Boston in the 70's, and I was a short order cook at the "Fatted
Calf"
in Boston, where I flipped burgers, and appointed little balls of cheese on
the
bloody pucks of meat. So I know what it is like to work in the food industry

and it ain't easy.



Torra, has written a memoir "Call Me Waiter," that recalls his many years as
a
server and his struggle to establish himself as a writer. The waiter jobs he
had
were transient, grueling, often well-paid, and most importantly provided him

with the flexibility to write. Torra writes of his slow ascent as a writer,
and his
vocation as a means to an end:



"My poetry was bringing a modicum of success and that is where I would put
my energy. Poems were being accepted by various little magazines. After
reading at the Word of Mouth, I also gave readings around the city.
Friendships developed with writers I came in contact with.  If it took
working
shifts in a restaurant at night to support this life, so be it."



Torra goes into detail not only about his working life, but also about the
subculture of restaurants: the gay waiters, the alcoholic managers, the
sociopath cooks, the parade of grad students, artists, musicians, supporting

their lifestyle, and pocketing tips. In this passage Torra describes the
typical
reaction when he tells people at work that he is a writer:



"I'm always bemused at the way they react when they find out I am a writer.
It shouldn't come as any surprise. There are probably more artists in the
restaurant business, pound for pound, than any other industry, I've worked
with jazz, rock, folk and classical musicians, sculptures, dancers, female
impersonators, actor, singers, photographers, poets and novelists-I even
worked with a guy who painted with spoons. Why else, they must wonder,
would someone my age be doing this.?



I tell them . They look puzzled. If I publish novels what am I doing here? I

attempt an abridged account of the publishing industry. They're bewildered.
Then a friendly grin, perhaps they figured it out-I can't be much of a
writer if
I publish books and tend bar for a living."



At the end of the memoir Torra realizes that he is at the end of the line
with
being a waiter, and cuts himself loose. Although frightened, he enjoyed a
sense of freedom:



"I have no idea where I am headed, what the future holds. Images of working
all night as a shelf stocker, a cab driver or variety store clerk cross my
mind. I
know I must remain out of the business no matter what it takes. Something is

out there for me. Standing on bike pedals to stretch my legs, I feel like I
am
floating."



"Call Me Waiter" is one of the better books I have read about the writing
life.
Torra has a workman-like style, that lays out the consuming need to write,
and the need to support it anyway you can-no matter what, in a straight, no
chaser fashion. Torra, born to a blue collar family in Medford, Mass brings
a
work ethic to his life and art that is a refreshing change from all the Left
Bank,
Iowa Writers Workshop stuff that lines the bookshelves.



Highly recommended.

Print on demand is simply ultra small run digital printing. In theory
the thousadth book and the first are identical, barring problems that
occur no matter how the image is applied to the paper--glitches in
inking, folding and binding. In all cases a human should be doing
quality control. When that fails the printer should redo the book.
I've been having all of Junction Press' books printed digitally for
the past several years and will soon digitize all back titles. All
printers screw up occasionally, and my luck with offset printers was
in general considerably worse than with digital printers. In
particular, they were far less pleasant about redoing badly-made
books. Maybe your publisher should find a different digital house.

Plain covers are a good solution. Another might be to make something of the
misaligned printings and various other potential problems. Put the original
design on a website. Put a note inside encouraging readers to send in the
variations they receive. Have people vote on their favorite.

**Boog City
http://www.welcometoboogcity.com

Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 17th year and Eas=
t
Village community newspaper of the same name. It has also published 35
volumes of poetry and various magazines, featuring work by Allen Ginsberg
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme issues on baseball,
women=B9s writing, and Louisville, Ky. It hosts and curates two regular
performance series=8Bd.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press, where
each month a non-NYC small press and its writers and a musical act of their
choosing is hosted at Chelsea=B9s ACA Galleries; and Classic Albums Live,
where up to 13 local musical acts perform a classic album live at venues
including The Bowery Poetry Club, Cake Shop, CBGB=B9s, and The Knitting
Factory. Past albums have included Elvis Costello, My Aim is True; Nirvana,
Nevermind; and Liz Phair, Exile in Guyville.


**Liv Carrow
http://www.myspace.com/livcarrow
=20
Navel gazing, highly biographical, cathartic lyricism, obnoxious punning,
moot metaphor, unabashed self-consciousness, and run-on sentences of
self-promotion are qualities nary as compelling as in the case of NYC's Liv
Carrow. Her songs are like the little animals that your 4-year-old nieces
and nephews make out of play-doh; lumpy yet distinguishable in form,
rudimentary to the point of psychedelic complexity, dry and crumbly on the
outside but all kinds of squishy on the inside.
=20
The mysterious and oddly lovable bassist from ecstatically weird acts
Huggabroomstik and Griffin and the True Believers takes the scenic back roa=
d
to your heart with her porch-swing guitar folk songs and clever-ish
observations on life, death, love, health food, human reproduction, the
unseen world of cosmic currents, awkward crushes, metaphysics, and,
everyone's favorite, despair.
=20
Her influences run the gauntlet from Patsy Cline to Kate Bush to Michael
Gira. Her debut album, It's About Time, recorded and produced by
Huggabroomstik co-frontman Dashan Coram, is available through Olive Juice
Music.
=20

=20
CAConrad is the son of white trash asphyxiation whose childhood included
selling cut flowers along the highway for his mother and helping her
shoplift. He escaped to Philadelphia where he lives and writes with the
PhillySound poets. He is the author of Deviant Propulsion (Soft Skull
Press), (Soma)tic Midge (Faux Press), and The Book of Frank (Chax Press),
and, forthcoming next year, advanced ELVIS course (Soft Skull Press), and a
collaboration with poet Frank Sherlock titled The City Real & Imagined:
Philadelphia Poems (Factory School).

the novel, Eyes of the Forest, and the poetry collection, Breathing Nose
Mountain. Her work has appeared in a variety of U.S. and Canadian journals

As a solo artist and with his band Cheese On Bread, Dan Fishback has
released four full-length albums in the past four years. As a performance
artist, he received the 2007-2009 Six Points Fellowship to develop his new
play, You Will Experience Silence, which will open in the spring of 2009. I=
n
2006, P.S.122 mounted a mini-festival of his work in "No Direction Homo: Th=
e
Many Identical Personae of Dan Fishback." His other theater work has been
presented at Dixon Place, Galapagos Art Space, and Brooklyn Arts Exchange.
His writing has been published in Mentsh: On Being Jewish and Queer (Alyson

**Casey Holford + Daoud Tyler-Ameen
http://www.caseyholford.com/
http://www.myspace.com/artsororityforgirls
=20
Casey Holford was raised on a diet of folk music and comic books in
Massachusetts. He started playing piano at 12, picked up his mother's guita=
r
for coffeehouse and DIY shows at 14, and was performing regularly in the
Boston-Providence songwriter circuit by 18. Now, living in Brooklyn at age
27, he has recorded three self-released solo albums, two EPs, and a 7-inch
on RiYL records. He moonlights in the bands Outlines, Urban Barnyard, Dream
Bitches, and Art Sorority for Girls, playing bass, electric, 12 string, and
baritone guitars. Casey is also a prolific producer, helping to document hi=
s
community by working on projects with fellow bands and songwriters, most
recently pop riot Cheese on Bread, visionary Dave Deporis, and upstart
Creaky Boards.
=20
Daoud Tyler-Ameen grew up on the lower east side of Manhattan. His
songwriting career began in high school with a string of extra-credit
projects about literary characters and the life cycles of plants. After
graduation he started a new project called the Art Sorority for Girls, a
collection of story-songs about the awful messes kids can get themselves
into. Daoud's versatility as a drummer and multi-instrumentalist is the
creative glue that has helped to hold Urban Barnyard, Outlines, and Cheese
on Bread together. Daoud is working on Art Sorority's debut long player wit=
h
Casey, Major Matt Mason USA, and Andrew Hoepfner.

**Eliot Katz
http://www.poetspath.com/exhibits/eliotkatz/

Poet and activist Eliot Katz is the author of five books of poetry,
including Unlocking the Exits and When the Skyline Crumbles: Poems for the
Bush Years. His forthcoming book, Love, War, Fire, Wind: Looking Out (North
America's Skull), is a collaboration with the artist, William T. Ayton.

**Ben Kreiger
http://www.benkrieger.com/
=20
Ben often claims to be a Brooklyn songwriter. Anyone who meets him, however=

We might start by asking people like Geoffrey Gatza how he maintains the

the instructions the publisher gives the printer. It doesn't seem to be, =

The best POD service I've run into is bookmobile.com   You would be
hardpressed to tell the difference between traditionally produced
books & their titles. They print a lot of books for a long list of
university presses. They have choices of coverstock as well as several
choices for interior paper.  The downside of them is their pricing is
only competitive over 50 copies.

The rest of it is about your design & setup.

I'm in the process of digitizing all 130 of Xexoxial's backlist so I
know all too intimately the ins & outs of making digitally printed
books stack up.

NOW AVAILABLE: Jim McCrary's All That



ManyPenny Press is pleased to announce the release of All That by Jim
McCrary. This collection of chapbooks, McCrary's first full-length book,
spans over twenty years of the author's efforts.

Channeling William Carlos Williams, Ed Dorn, Robert Grenier, Joanne Kyger
and others on and within the airwaves, McCrary has created a body of poems
that snips and snaps, chuckles and guffaws, tugs and strokes, kisses and
bites. Steve Tills puts it this way: "Jim has devoted his spirit and heart
to pursuits decidedly antithetical to self-aggrandizement. Quietly, he has
followed a most courageous lineage of others also both gentle and careful in
their approach to telling the truth and making it uniquely compelling. You'
ll sometimes recognize that lineage when you take up All That. You'll
frequently marvel at the quiet, substantive authenticity McCrary has
achieved in the sometimes lonesome but always deeply communal turns his
truly individuated, unequivocally human poeming has taken."

Or as K. Silem Mohammad puts it: "Out of the wild Kansas plains comes a
howling wind, and in that wind is a howling wolf, and in that wolf is a
howling lamb, and in that lamb is a Russian doll with another Russion doll
inside it, and inside that one another one, and inside that one a plastic
pill bottle because one of the dolls got broken, and in that bottle one last
Russian doll, and in that last doll another howling wind-and here we go all
over again. Somewhere in there, probably around the first wind and the wolf,
is the poetry of Jim McCrary, which is really really really really good."

I've done better with Sterling Pierce, and it's a real plus that
they're local (NY suburb)--on occasion I've watched the covers come
off the press. They print for a lot of the majors.
There are now a lot of digital printers around the country. Check to
see who's in the neighborhood.

All forms of publishing have their limitations, and limitations can have
their advantages if they're seen in the right light. A number of people hav=
e
asked me why Jed Birmingham and I are using print-on-demand publishing for
our magazine Mimeo Mimeo, rather than making it a nice letterpress edition
or using an actual mimeograph. I think of print-on-demand as the mimeograph
for the 21st century: it's cheap, fast, and allows anyone with access to a
computer the potential to become a publisher. That raises the question of
quality control and editorial authority as it applies to the publisher,
author and designer. The mediation of books by corporate publishing houses
is still an issue, but one that is distinct from the circulation of writing
in poetry circles such as this. The majority of the authors I read made
their first appearance in print by way of the little magazine, small press,
or through independent online sites. What would the face of poetry look lik=
e
if our reading was controlled by only a hand of major presses? With
print-on-demand, a magazine or chapbook can materialize overnight, whereas =
a
letterpress edition would take months to produce and the cost (both overhea=
d
and retail) would be significantly higher then what it is now. That said,
the materials and to some degree the dimensions are limitations, tho
companies like Bookmobile will trim to size, and as we have seen in some
Ugly Duckling Press books, they will accept the client's coverstock if a
request is made in advance.
=20
So I=B9m all in favor of companies (Lulu, Cafe Press, BookSurge, etc.) that
allow writers to publish what they want, whenever they please at an
affordable price, but the integrity of the design is still key, and I can
only speak from experience when I say that books like Robert Bringhurst's
Elements of Typographic Style or Ellen Lupton's Thinking with Type can be
very useful for publishers and self-publishers who don't have any formal
typographic training. As Bringhurst says in his foreword, "If you use this
book as a guide, by all means leave the road when you wish. That is
precisely the use of a road: to reach individually chosen points of
departure. By all means break the rules, and break them beautifully,
deliberately and well. That is one of the ends for which they exist." The
computer poses few limitations in terms of design, and in some ways the
freedom of programs like InDesign can be overwhelming. In Mimeo Mimeo, Jed
and I have attempted to create a minimalist design based on classical
proportions and conservative notions of legibility in order to honor and
preserve the author=B9s intentions, and yet we=B9re perfectly content with the
=B3no frills=B2 aesthetic of the journal.
=20
As to perfect-bound books, spines are often misaligned, the trim size can
vary significantly, and the fragile covers have the potential to become
scuffed and scratched. Taking these things into account as one designs can
help to hide the inherent shortcomings of the technology and production
value (for instance, introducing an asymmetrical spine where the lettering
doesn=B9t come too close to the front or rear covers will disguise the
irregularity of the binding). That said, I feel strongly that the printers
still have an obligation to stand behind their services, and make good on
any shortcomings that are brought to their attention.

Lightning Source's cover colors seriously migrate over multiple printings;
my Da3 color is becoming a greener yellow over time.

I have not had good luck with bookmobile; they have done the gala *first
printing* of Ray Bianchi's IMMEDIATE EMPIRE, now available in stores, in
addition to two rounds of galleys for that book.  Get it now, while you can
get the rare *canary paper* print run!!!

This is not peculiar to digital printing, and in fact is more of a
problem with offset, although it doesn't become an issue as often
because offset runs tend to be larger and we tend to do subsequent
printings less often, which means that usually we're dealing with
only one set of inks. It's always easy to correct in digital--it's
just a setting on a machine.

One book that I did digitally managed to turn the author portrait
from black and white to bilious green and white, although in the
proof copy that I had approved it had been fine. Always get a proof
done--the printer can be held to accounts for whatever differences. I
showed the book to the printer, who promptly dumped the entire run
and got a new run to me, this time with correct colors, in two days.
There were no arguments, no ill feelings. It turned out that the guy
who does their covers was out sick the day it was run--he had done
the proofs. Mistakes happen. McNaughton and Gunn, on the other hand,
ran out of a color in the middle of a print run on one of my books,
as a result of which the run wasn't uniform. Dealing with them about
their mistakes was often so difficult that I let it ride.

 Sarnoff, chairman of=0Athe publishers association. "It's hard work writing=
 a book, and even=0Aharder work getting paid for it," said Roy Blount, pres=
ident of the=0Aguild. "This deal makes good sense."=0AThe agreement mirrors=
 the=0Away that Apple's iTunes music store helped revolutionise the record=

=0AUK publishers hoped the deal will=0Abe replicated. Simon & Schuster UK's=
 chief executive, Ian Chapman,=0Asaid: "It's a significant agreement, but a=
lso has substance for the=0Alonger term - it's ground-breaking." Mark Le Fa=

 for, while at=0Athe same time it promises to make the practicalities easil=

version 3. they say, of software, that only when it gets to version 3 does
it start to really hit its stride. version 1 was terrific in that it
provided a service in a way that no one else did, previously. but the
software was buggy, and the features and their options were limited. version
2 filled out the big picture of the main feature set, but the software was
still buggy and, although the feature set was more visible, the options
within the features were still limited.

we seem to be at web 2.0.

hopefully 3.0 will expand the options within the features sufficiently.

i think pod is a beautiful event. it wrests control of the means of
production away from just a few.

though, nonetheless, cultural power is still location-centred,
unfortunately. by this i mean that however good one's work and also
knowledge of the technologies, it is still hard to operate with influence
outside of the world centres such as ny paris london berlin. and what has
influence from those centres often does so only by virtue of location, not
the quality of the work. still, via communications tech, there is more
access of x to y, regardless of location.

Christophe, are you soliciting stolen materials that have been miraculously=
 cured of liability, in terms of ownership and copyright? Intellectual prop=
erty for sale? Give it away, give it away, now? How can you verify that you=
 can and will publish their work with impunity, etc. Are words or groups of=
 words copyrightable, etc. Is this the trend, a reuse/recycle mentality, et=
c. What of the true poet, etc.


(I do know a poet quite good at this, however! He's master of his mesh-craf=

Thanks, Andrea. What a classy subject. POD books are a great idea, with poo=
r quality. The worst is those grooves or ridges down the spine-sides of the=
 POD covers. Right away it looks tacky. Plain covers are a nice solution. (=
Except, we'll all look like thesis writers, haha, or pretentious intellectu=
als, hehe.) We at AWAREing print editions, small at first, until they sell =
out, and then another edition can be printed if demand continues. Eventuall=
y we will all print everything out at home--- did you know scientists, arch=
itects and other visual thinkers can select to print 3-D models for almost =
anything? As always, content is superior to packaging--- although, we all l=
ike a book to look nice on a nightstand, don't we.

dear listers,

i feel i'm having a mental block and am eager for the remedy of your
collective wisdom: i am looking for precedents in the history of
poetry for appropriations of other texts into one's own poems, and yet
nothing comes immediately into my view prior to tzara's dadaist poem
and the high modernist use of documentary materials (pound, williams,
reznikoff, rukeyser).

any thoughts on the history or genealogy of appropriative poetics
greatly appreciated.

sincerely,
tom orange

[Apologies for cross posting]

Suddenly out of nowhere, at very short notice, there will be a reading
by

Chris Goode, Tomas Weber & (hopefully) one or more others t.b.a.

this Friday, October 31st, at 7.30pm

at the Judith E Wilson Drama Studio, Faculty of English, West Road,
Cambridge

Free entry. Refreshments.

All are welcome.

Chris Goode is a writer and performance maker. His most recent book of
poems is NoSon House (Barque) and his work was featured in the recent
British Poetry issue of Chicago Review. He has read widely, including
at the Cambridge Poetry Summit, Sub Voicive, Crossing the Line and
Total Writing London, and quite frequently at the Klinker. He blogs at
Thompson's Bank of Communicable Desire (http://beescope.blogspot.com).

Still in his teens, Tomas Weber is one of the most interesting and
incisive young poets now emergent. His work can be seen at Blackbox
and at the Poetry Society web site, and some of the thinking around it
can be traced at his widely read and appreciated blog, Green Ideas
Sleeping Furiously (http://tomasjosephweber.blogspot.com). He is among
the contributing writers on Chris Goode's new theatre piece Hey Mathew.

I'd say that the earliest appropriative form is probably the cento (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cento_(poetry)), composed entirely out of
borrowed lines from various sources.  Ashbery's "To a Waterfowl" and
Berrigan's "Cento: A Note on Philosophy" are two contemporary examples that
jump immediately to mind.

Eliot, a high modernist, managed to sneak some Shakespeare into the Waste Land. Most notably, Anthony & Cleo... & no no doupt he smuggled a good deal of other stuff in as well. I mention Eliot, because his method of doing this was perhaps the most subtle, avoiding mere documentary.

I'm not familiar with the cento, but I'm interested in it now.

Tom:

This is a great question, but I want to know more context: hoping to answer
the questions, appropriate/appropriation "how" and "why" for your use?

Where are you drawing the source / translation / genre switch / stealing
lines?

All best,
Catherine Daly

or Homer: I don't think you could find a single line of his that
wasn't appropriated from another poet's work.

downtown Manhattan or around Park Slope in Brooklyn.   One or two
months is ok.  Dates are flexible. Please back channel to barbhenn@mac.com

From PennSound -- Race and Poetry
=A0
Recorded September 21, 2008 as part of this year's BOOG City Festival, "Rac=
e and Poetry: Integrating the Experimental" is a panel discussion organized=
 and moderated by Amy King, featuring Tisa Bryant, Jennifer Firestone, Timo=
thy Liu, Mendi Obadike, Meghan Punschke, Christopher Stackhouse and Mathias=
 Svalina.

The conversation begins with opening statements by King, Svalina, Obadike a=
nd Punschke, which are followed by further commentary by King, Firestone an=
d Liu. Liu's comments on the late Reginald Shepherd's take on the marriage =
of race and aesthetics, and the conjunctions of homoeroticism and race, pro=
voke a round of responses from the panelists, which is followed by comments=
 by Tisa Bryant. From there, the discussion moves into a number of thematic=
 topics, including "the Question of Difference," "Buying into Whiteness," "=
Destabilizing Whiteness" and "Disfunctioning Color." The hour-and-forty-min=
ute recording concludes with a lengthy question-and-answer period.

Am I right that the question was about the appropriation of
identified blocks of text, like mincorporating a newspaper article or
a folktale? As opposed to simple borrowing or plagiarism.

& why not go back to the Old Testament, how much of it was original?
Homer, hmmm, how much do we really know about him? really, not a single, repeat, Not a single line of his ... as usual, speculation isn't proof.

Since a great deal of the work of the Pre-Socratics and ancient Greek poets
(Sappho, for example--and many others--I'm only writing of the West, though
this has occurred in Taoist texts also in China, poetry and otherwise)--a
great deal of work has come down as being included in the works of
others--who may or not make note or sly allusion that these are buried lines
attributed to so and so--and yet--being appropriated thus reflect as well on
the one preserving them--so that appropriation becomes a badge of knowledge
and taste, a sign of one's own high standing in the ascending rungs the
stars must take on their "stairway to heaven"--
that is--the greater the name, or--the more obscure--that one
appriopriates--the more of aninsider cult one--or the more popularyy
recognized--all these sources from which appropriations are made become, as
a "value" as a "name brand," also part of the "value of appropriation as a
method" when it is done in this manner--
and so in turn confer upon the "knowing and alert reader" the sense also of
ebing one of these stars ascending ther stairway and likewise "in with the
in  crowd"--
but this is only one aspect of appropriation's wild and colorful history--

in the period of roughly 1590-1700, in the genre, immensely popular at the
time--of "travel literature," there was massive plagiarism going on and in
immensely imaginative ways, with a borrowing here, a stolen bit there and
everywhere a stitch in time saves nine and voila one has produced yet a new
book of wonders, authored by a pseudonym--
in turn translated by the same person under a different name into the
"french"--so that it there appears as the work of yet another pseudonym--and
then is translated back into English by again the same person, with the
"translation" appearing under yet a new name--

(this method is used today by various agencies planting disinformation,
among them MEMRI, which furnishes almost  the Middle Eastern news for the
entire mainstream American media--)

(these things all happened--Defoe was one of the great practitioners, and
Sterne also was a merry inventor of the voyages to the various then "New"
worlds as well as ones among the "old"--)

the greatest contemporary practitioner of creating works from found
materials is Paul Metcalf, great grandson of Herman Melville--Paul's
magnificent sound poem APALACHE is a full book--history of that area of the
proto-United States--constructed entirely of texts he put togetehr--
not a word of his own appears in the text--
many of his other works are built using the same principal, although in each
a particular set of themes or images is used to make connections which bring
togetehr "unrelated" events, histories, persons to create revelatory
histories, geographies and physiognomies--for example, I-57--written to
celebrate his 57th year--is an account of a journey up route I-57--which
uses texts from nervous system ailments, migraines and others to make
another form of mapping simultaneous with that "found on the AAA maps"--

BOTH--combines the lives of John Wilkes Booth and Poe--and in Genoa, the
diaries of Columbus and works of Melville occupy the mind of a narrator
during an evening as he cares for his children and travels also in time
through the adventures of his criminal brother's life--

I think Metcalf of any writer i have so far found is the greatest at making
"connections" among found  materials, quantum leaps that are a pure poetry
in action--and using these juxtapositions of words and phrases to bring
forth new arrangements of images, sounds, ideas that are astonishing, for
again, their uncanny effect--
things which seem at once familiar and yet strangely new, unknown--as though
seen for a first time and at the same time with a sense of eerie deja vu--
and as well plunging one, like his ancestor, into depths which are found to
be teeming among the materials of the existent world of elements and
objects, forces and actions, of something Other--
Paul cited a number of times the music of Charles Ives as an example--the
use of bits and pieces of music from every sphere of hearing--arranged into
a completely different yet at the same time uncannily familiar "picture" in
sound--

Clark Coolidge wrote a very amazing work of appropriation i think influenced
by Metcalf (as was a lot of Susan Howe's earlier work)--Smithson
Depositions--which makes use of texts by Kerouac, WCW, Robert Smithson,
Godard, geology texts, etc--it's an extraordinary and beautiful work--

the travel literature texts--a number of them are yet in print--even though
chunks of them are inventions as well as appropriations--sewn togetehr by a
traveller who never left a cosy fire side desk--
Defoe wrote a book on Madagascar for example that was still used seriously
by travellers for over a hundred fifty years after Defoe had entirely
imagined it and used also the bits and pieces his sharp eye had come across
in the flood ties of verbiage washing ashore in England and the other
countries of Europe during the mad rushing years to gobble up the hew
world--

out of this literature was born eventually the first forms of the modern
novel of "realism"--such as Defoe's own!--to be sure--

earlier, as has been noted, Shakespeare was using huge chunks of work that
came ashore from Italy and Spain--and there were cross pollinations of texts
through the late Middle Ages, into the Renaissance and Elizabethan
periods--often one may find transpositions (translations of another form, to
put it in a poetic manner--)--

transpositions of  whole works, with only the names of characters and
settings changed to conform the local area and ruler's policies and the
scandals of local  VIPs--

what is now the United States of course furnished an incredible breeding
ground for texts of all sorts which in turn produced texts from amongst
themselves--with cross breedings, transpositions, faked translations,
plagiarisms, al mixed with here and there some actual observations of an
actual traveler--not to mention the accounts being included given by Indians
who were simply "giving the wrong directions" to gullible explorers--

if one examines the history of the survival of much of Sappho's writing, it
is really long history of it's been erased (by burnings primarily) as well
as its being 'included in" the works of others--a kind of incredible hood
ornament added to make the vehicle of the moment have more class so to
speak--and at the same time the efforts made to have it "melt" into the
surfaces of the appropriators' works--

of course the greatest appropriator in a sense, the one who turns this
method on its head entirely--is Borges' Pierre Menard--who manages the
writing, word for word, of two Chapters and part of a third, of Don Quixote,
and which the commentator and historian of  Menard's works demonstrates the
superiority of to the originals by Cervantes--

however, it may be argued, Menard is not setting out to appropriate
Cervantes, but to write Cervantes--

write not as Cervantes but write as Pierre Menard writing Cervantes--

The first great critic in American literary history is Edgar Allan Poe, for
whom the questions of plagiarism and appropriation were an obsession. Since
Poe himself often filched a bit here and a tidbit there, as well as
inventing "classical authors and their quotations,"--one may see the common
psychological effect of projection at work--accusing others of what one sees
and fears to see and know of in oneself--

Poe was also the past master of hoaxes--furthering confusing the issues when
it came to his own works, prompting him to insist al the more loudly and
wildly on the crimes of others against the rigors he insisted upon as being
necessary for a nascent literature to be taken seriously as having, indeed,
its own existence at at all, and one separate from that of the English
language--

(this is why he's in WC W's In the American Grain--for his criticism--the
original "Tommyhawk Man")

appropriation of course, is also used in detournement, to turn an image
against itself by the addition of a caption--which can be accomplished also
in lines of poems--
and appropriation simply as a montage or collage--the one building to an
ideological statement, the other to a satire perhaps--

or, as in some examples from the visual arts (Sherry Levine, Cindy Sherman,
et alia--) one may simply take a photo of a photo or reconstruct a photo and
take a photo of that--and so be making a commentary on the original photo
itself being an example of an image within a prior system which constructed
it--

i think an interesting area is that in which it becomes difficult to discern
the distinctions between mimicry and appropriation--

at a certain level, one might say that all writing is a form of
appropriation, for in each word that one writes, each writer has in them a
sense of their own from which source they are appropriating it in th sense
of which first time hearing or seeing of that word they have carried with
them in memory--

so that with each word in each writer may be living millions of teeming
appropriations--or fewer, depending on the writer--

in another way, so many words are already constructed as things made to be
appropriated, carried about daily as the basic materials "to get by in this
world"--that without anyone realizing it, they are just things "everyone has
on them"--

such is the meaning of "stock phrases" for example or "cliches" and
"nostrums"--al this baggage one totes about that one pulls out in an
emergency or in a daydream half interrupted--and dishes out blandly--

think on how many things in a day one might write or say really that are
just appropriations more or less word for word of something heard or said
just a bit earlier in the day--
and one produces them calmly, casually, quite offhand, mind you--as though
they are indeed the completely new and original thoughts of one's own--

probably a good deal more than anyone realizes throughout the course of the
day is just a continual appropriation of texts from earlier in the day
culled from here and there, screen, CD, video, news flash, email, book,
overheard conversation, direct conversation--and so and on--al this immense
flood of words and phrases with which one is quickly and nimbly making those
quick hand outs of platitudes that smooth the operations of negotiating
one's passage through the language infested day--

so itis that one begins to wonder--my God!--have i said or thought one
original thing all day!
or  but been just an appropriatin' fool!
skipping along happily flinging out the posies of phrases picked up on the
lawns of others--

ah yes--and to ask of Emily Post--
my dear, when is it appropriate
to appropriate?

for are not disquisitions on etiquette as formally of interest as though of
ethics says a little mouse, who hopes someday to be the Oscar Wilde of the
mouse holes in Emily's decaying--genteely, to be sure, old heap--

to appopriate refuse, the thrown out, is another tradition--(to which i
belong)--the "utility of the useless"--the use of the mud for gold a la
Baudelaire--alchemies of alleyways--Rimbaud's famous catalog of junk he
found of use--and Schwitters picking up used bus tickets in the muddy
desparing streets--

an appropriation of what no one wants!--
because in good part, "necessity is the motherfucker of invention"--

this is the appropriation method or style at the other end of the spectrum
form that which makes use of the highest of vlue materials in order to
refelct well on the caliber of the poet doing the appropriating--

as one may see, there reamins really vast work to be done with the questions
involved with appropriation, in the realms simply of what it means in terms
of taste, for example--and of the ettiquette of the approproiate use of
appropriation--and al the hosts of meanings that may be wrung from each
different aspect and its contexts--

its placements within the streams and flows of time--

for each appropriation is it not, creates a new history for the words whcih
it appropriates, reframes them, regalvanizes them--that is, if the
appropriator is worth their salt-!

as some indeed simply fall falt--but when it is working the old
approrpriation mill is helping to keep alive the endless quantum
possiblitlies of what are the uncertainty principle of words, letters,
signs--

hi all,

catherine daly and mark weiss were looking for some clarification on
my question regarding a possible genealogy or history of appropriative
writing. first off, and thanks to those who provided 20th-century
examples but yes i'm really looking for precedents prior to dada and
high modernism.

as far as defining terms, i really do have in mind mostly what mark
says, substantive if not wholesale incorporation of an other('s) text,
however identified or not, into one's own. so i'm less interested in,
say, the rhapsode as song-stitcher of a people's tales; or as dave
chirot points to among his many great suggestions, the renaissance
notion of imitation or authority through citation of others rather
than through originality; or citation as example, through which, as
dave points out, many pre-socratic, sapphic etc fragments found their
sole survival; or translation, which still in most cases wants to
preserve and remain faithful to the original author's intent...

and so as to catherine's "appropriation how/why," precisely. i'm
looking to a genealogy of appropriative poetics in part to
differentiate poets' means, intents, motives etc for doing so in the
first place. so for example, 1) tzara says make a dada poem by tearing
up a newspaper and arranging the strips you've pulled from a hat; 2)
pound, reznikoff, rukeyser pull documents from the historical and
legal records to include in their poems; 3) cage reads thru joyce,
thoreau, etc and creates mesostics from their words. clearly in each
case the authors have different motivations for these appropriative
acts and i'd like to try to map out the field, including precedents
for this kind of activity.

additional suggestions and discussion welcome...

thanks,
tom orange

Thanks, as usual, for all that, David.=0AJJust one thing to add: It is well=
 worth readiing "The=C2=A0Dream of the Poem," Peter Cole's great anthology =
of Medieval Hebrew poetry....If you read the extensive annotations along wi=
th the poems you will see that, however original no matter what the ostensi=
ble subject, each one is basically a web of allusions to the Bible. It beco=
mes clear that for them, the ultimate poetic trope was the citation.=0A=0A=

Walter Benjamin's *The Arcades Project* and Montaigne's *Essays* are
masterpieces made mostly of quotations, the writer's own thoughts weaving
around them.

Translation, if properly understood as the creation of parallel meta-texts
rather than as copies, is a genre of appropriation. W. Benjamin's "ideal
language" -which is his concept of what translation involves-  is
essentially a hypertext composed entirely of appropriated texts.

Since the early 1960s, legendary multimedia artist Carolee Schneemann has b=
lazed a groundbreaking, taboo-busting path through the art world. Expressiv=
e, exuberant and intelligent, her work ranges from hand-made diary films an=
d politically charged performances to painting, poetry, and installation, a=
ll the while exploring and overturning preconceived notions of sexuality, g=
ender, and the body. Tonight, Schneemann will present a collection of recen=
tly restored films, performance videos, and new work, including the first t=
wo installments of her landmark Autobiographical Trilogy: FUSES (1964=E2=80=
=9467), in which she painted, scratched, and collaged self-shot footage of =
herself and then-partner James Tenney's erotic explorations, and PLUMB LINE=
 (1971), along with the influential performance pieces BODY COLLAGE (1967) =
and AMERICANA I CHING APPLE PIE (1978=E2=80=942007) and her latest video IN=
FINITY KISSES=E2=80=94THE MOVIE (2008).

Tickets to movies are $9 general admission, $7 students, $4 for student, fa=
culty of the School of the Art Institute, and staff of the Art Institute. $=

individual in relationship to social bodies. Her works have been exhibited =
internationally, including a full retrospective at the New Museum of Conter=

u, MoMA, and Whitney. Schneemann has taught at several universities, includ=
ing the California Institute of the Arts, the School of the Art Institute o=

Tom,

I'm new here and possibly a moron, but bear with me... IS it possible that
appropriations of poetic and quasi-poetic texts exist in early renditions of
religious texts, doctrines, holidays and parables? Does oral tradition
itself bring up questions of appropriation when looking at the geneology of
authorship?

Just some questions.

JR
