From: "Steven Shoemaker"
"To consent to language signifies to act in such a way that, in the
abysmal experience of the taking place of language, in the removal of the
voice, another Voice is disclosed to man, and along with this are also
disclosed the dimension of being and the moral risk of nothingness."
(Giorgio Agamben, Language and Death, cited by Taggart writing on Oppen)

and this just in bc from another list:

Exactly.  I don't think any of us has a handle on it yet.  But we're all
more than spectators and are participants, though the majority don't
have a clue about that.  The odd and frightening thing is that most
treat it as a spectator event.   Cheer cheer cheer!  Roar of the crowd
as the blade comes down, then quick-cut to one's own head in the basket.
 Oh.  This was a reality show?

Anyway, those who *are* aware, and are writers, have a different task.
Unfortunately, looking back at how previous writers handled similar
moments in their life and work is of little help this time around.

- Jim [Cervantes]

but what of Pushkin? and the Gendarme of Europe?

to write out of pain it must be accepted?


"Poetry is both the _repetition_ of an ontological moment and the ongoing
_process_ or work of enunciation by which that moment is recursively known
and carried forward....Human beings are unique in th compexity of form and
rang of semantic interpretations of their facial expressions - expressions
hat we have seen, in our mention of Charles Morris's work in semiotics, are
dependent on the rcognition of others, for we cannot see our own faces."
Susan Stewart, _Poetry and the Fate of the Senses_.  But what if the
expression determines the emotion and expression


BRAIN HAS A WAY OF DISTORTING MEMORIES

By Carey Goldberg, Globe Staff, 5/13/2003

Bad news for diary enthusiasts and raconteurs: Accumulating evidence
suggests that when it comes to preserving memories, certain things are
better left unsaid. For example, researchers found that when subjects
watched a videotape of a mock bank robbery, those who were asked to describe
the robber in detail just afterward had a harder time identifying him later
than those who had never tried to put their memories into words.
.............
then if pain is accepted and written about it is false?

on another point gender-recognition programs are not really required when it
comes to posting theory to a listserv,
are they?

fruitfull oliue and the platane round/Of highest God the Lord of life
and light/Thereby a Christall streame did gently play/Bidding his beades
all day for his trespas/Long way he trauelled before he heard of ought.

  Whose sences all were straight benumbd and starke/Her chast hart had
subdewd to learne Dame pleasures toy/And this faire couple eke to shroud
theselues were fain/Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy/To
proue his puissance in battell braue/Far hence quoth he in wastfull
wildernesse/That path he kept which beaten was most plaine/From turning
backe and forced her to stay/The drouping Night thus creepeth on them
fast/The fearefull Dwarfe this is no place for liuing men/And comming
where the knight in slomber lay/With bowres and beds and Ladies deare
delight/They flocked all about her bleeding wound/At last dull
wearinesse of former fight/Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell.

  The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide/Of a straunge man I
can you tidings tell/Whose corage when the feend perceiu'd to shrinke/At
night doth baite his steedes the Ocean waues emong/At last dull
wearinesse of former fight/And euer-drizling raine vpon the
loft/Approcht in hast to greet his victorie/Tydings of warre and worldly
trouble tell.

  He that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame/Her doubtfull words made
that redoubted knight/And more to lulle him in his slumber soft/Mixt
with a murmuring winde much like the sowne/She lookt about and seeing
one in mayle/Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes/Most like
that virgin true which for her knight him took/So forward on his way
with God to frend/There was an holy chappell edifyde/Faire harbour that

  I better wot then you though now too late/And creeping sought way in

suddain all were gone.

  Let me not dye in languor and long teares/That soone to loose her
wicked bands did her constraine/Whose sences all were straight benumbd

Very interesting, Gabe.

What is more surprising to me is that (1) according to the paper, gender is
more reliably deduced from fiction than non-fiction, and (2) that in
biography it succeeds only 90% of the time.  10% it cannot figure it out
from biography?  humans would be, uh, much more successful at guessing
biography.  for now.  as computers become more intelligent, people become
less intelligent, and so the scales will tip.  it is certainly NOT
surprising to either of us that authorial identity is more easily determined
from fiction than non-fiction.  i wonder if the study's basis texts included
poetry and, if so, whether they were considered fiction or non-fiction.

i'm also pleased that ideas particularly on the relationship between
identity and pronomial play i first outlined & demonstrated on proximate.org
four years ago are validated by Argamon's study.  one way of gesturing
authorial identity is from pronomial, number, and determiner use.
*misapplying* words in these categories confounds the ability of the reader
to make inroads on the author, forcing the reader "to stick to the text."

Kirby -

One plus one equals two is not a problem, actually.  you just have to assume
first that your requirements for identity (x=x) are loose enough.  that is
to say, you can remove the stricture of 4-d coordination from the identity
(or require not identity) and say that, for our purposes, these two
*separate* pencils are identical.  or, even better, you don't need identity
at all.  just commonalities.  so we can have two "yellow things."  or "two
long pointy writing things with erasers."  etc.

what your counting base is seems to have more of an impact.  if your base is
2 (binary), then 1+1 is 10.  but is this 10 called "ten" or "one-zero"?

Whitehead and Russell in the Principia were taking a Fregean approach to
mathematics:  they attempted to define mathematical entities, like numbers,
in pure logic and then derive their fundamental properties from those
entities.  They wanted a systematic way of describing mathematics, from the
ground up, using logical symbolism, to explain just about everything in
math.  While they stopped short of geometry (a proposed fourth volume never
written) I think they adequately showed it could be done.  Of course some
guy named Godel shows upa few years later to show that no such accounting
can ever be complete.  But just because it can't be complete doiesn't mean
it can't be done.  It just means you gotta keep poppoing outside the system
and look in to see where you came up short.

But Russell and Whitehead to my knowledge had no epic struggle over the
specific issue of addition. It was just one of many mathematical concepts
they covered in their 3 years of working on Principia.

I frequently encourage folks to be wary of confusing description and
generalization (re: abstraction) with stereotype.  i've fallen into this pit
myself.  the difference between generalization and stereotype?  stereotype
is an OVERsimplification: a generalization that has no predictive power and
may even be wielded for slander.  stereotype is a generalization that simply
isn't true AND is immediately hurtful or destructive, not instructive.  a
deletory side-effect of the 1990s lexicography wars was that a lot of
formerly intelligent people, in trying to do the right thing, confused
generalization and abstraction (the produce of intelligence) with stereotype
(the produce of idiocy).  As a result many intelligent persons stopped using
their intelligence, having lost the ability to make abstractions and careful
but necessary distinctions as a result of their confusions, and told others
that using their intelligence WAS BAD....

Math is dependent on generalizations, not over-generalizations.  Though, of
course, the line frequently blurs between the two, and sometimes the line
drawn between generalization and sterotype isn't there.  Sure, sure.  Such
delineations require your careful use of intelligence on a case-by-case
basis, not stereotypes.  To say that "math is based on stereotypes" is
itself, perhaps ironically, a stereotype.

To be critical of Olson (gasp!), I'd say that the desire for "getting back
to the immediate" is the opiate dream of the intellectual, right next to the
idea of revolution.  Like rich white urbanite Americans reading Walden and
then in a desperate quest for authenticity moving into a cabin in the woods
where they might become more intimate with their compost.

As a guiding ethic for poetic production, however, I'm not so sure that
Olson's call makes much sense today, at least, not for me.  While it may be
true that someone like Olson, immersed in books and ideas, reading and
writing indoors, might need to get back to perceptions, the average
American, full of the Matrix, Miller Lite, crystal meth, internet sex,
Comedy Central, Jet Skis, Grand Theft Auto, George Bush, child-molesting
priests, Las Vegas, Cosmo, and the Fox Network, is leading an intensely
*sensate* life.  These are lives perhaps in need of *backing away* a little
bit from perceptions and feeling, lives in need of making *more*
abstractions, having more thought, not less.

Interestingly enough, if you wanted to address such a problem in poetry, you
can't write abstractly for a sensate person and hope they're somehow going
to become a little more "thinking".  You have to write in a
sensate-provocative way to lead them to thinking.  But if you do write in
such a way, don't plan on having any poetry books of yours published. :(|)

I am related to J.L. Austin, but only academically.

Thanks for the interesting post.

Dear Bill Austin,

It may be true that I have rocks in my head for trying to express anything
but
the party line in regard to Iraq (and the rocks would therefore be a form of
consciousness), but I wanted to get back to a more peaceful topic with a
more
civil interlocuter (thanks to Kazim Ali and Mark Weiss and the others
willing to
provide room for discussion, though!).

I was thinking about the Principia Mathematica, which I've never read, but a
math scholar once told me on a plane trip that what Russell was attempting
to do
was to verify, or prove, that one plus one equals two.  After ten years he
realized he couldn't do it, and the way this was glossed was that Russell
realized there was no such thing as two of any one thing.  So, even two
Eberhard
#2 pencils, fresh out of the factory, are not the same.  They occupy
different
points in time and space, and they will have different futures: different
kids
chewing on them, and so on.

So from this I got thinking -- that even basic math doesn't really describe
the
world but is dependent on stereotypes.  "One" being a stereotype.  Like,
there
are all kinds of different shades of blue (I didn't quite understand the
shading
issue, but missed the original post) but we still say the word blue to cover
them when we say the "blue" car just went past.

By the way are you related to the important British philosopher of language
whose name if I recall is J.L. Austin?

Patrick Herron,

This was an enormously interesting post. I'm one of these people who are
terrified of mathematics, but also really interested in it.  It began in fourth
grade with the problem of -1 x -1 = 1.  How could it be, when I couldn't find
any real world adequation for this.  I talked with a high school math teacher at
a picnic recently and tossed him the question and he said, when a bad thing
happens to a bad guy, it's a good thing, so you see, it is adequate.  -1 x 1 =
-1, I asked.  When a bad thing happens to a bad guy, that's also bad.  1 x 1?
When a good thing happens to a good guy, that's good, too.

I wish my fourth grade teacher had thrown that at me.  I got wary of math,
instead.  At any rate, I really liked your note.  I'm going to print it out and
keep it.  I have wondered endlessly about Frege. I've read only a few essays,
but really enjoyed them.  Lyotard as you probably know uses him as a source.

What do you think Frege would say about the Marxist idea of classes?  Would he
buy them as do-able (is that the word?) sets?

Would he say that race, gender and class (our only aesthetic criteria as far as
I can make out these days) are understandable entities?  They all seem to be
under attack -- race is constructed -- I guess.  I knew a guy who ran an
all-black church but who was technically white, for instance.  His parents died
in a car-crash, and he was raised by a black family.  He went to Morehouse
College and wasn't accepted by the blacks, he said, and yet he was completely
black, culturally.  And he wasn't completely rejected, either.  He was, after
all, the chosen pastor of an African Episcopal congregation.  And yet in terms
of affirmative action reports he was considered white.  Meanwhile gender appears
to be completely porous -- or has been assumed to be.  Men can become women, and
women men, and according to some theorists, are always popping back and forth.
And poor people get rich, and rich get poor.  What does Frege do with such
seemingly porous sets?  I have wondered about this forever, but have never
gotten around to doing the math, so to speak, or in other words, reading Frege.
There seems to be so many prerequisites to doing this -- although he does have
some essays that don't depend too heavily on math.  Would you have any
recommendations?  I think his ideas of set theory are amazingly coherent and
sharply defined, but they also have lots of paradoxical kinks in them -- like
the one about the barber -- or was that Russell's joke?  These guys are a little
outside my area -- I'm mostly interested in aesthetic theory.  I thought so
beautiful his description of Venus and the morning star as one object but with
different frameworks of meaning around them (this is what Lyotard uses to talk
about the slipperiness of politics of identity, I think, or at any rate, that's
what I was thinking about when I read it).

Interesting bit of info cited in this article, that Americans on average
read only 24 minutes a day. This includes books, magazines, cereal boxes,
etc.  I wonder how this compares with other countries. Does anybody have the
statistics on this?

Ebay has a couple of EEG's selling for $600-$1,000 if you really want to

I've been reading a Hawaiian grammar and another Hawaiian dictionary; I've
also been reading some of the history, mythology, etc. of Hawaiian. Hawaii
is a conjunction of so many issues of colonialism, language,
misrepresentation, stereotyping, etc.; it is also another example of
ongoing US imperialism and a conjunction or disjunction for my interests
in Japan. The texts I've been generating have been from Hawaiian words,
sometimes including their English counterparts - for example ala and nei.
I want to work with texts that are collocations, rhizomatic and fragmented
collections, of tendencies towards answering philosophical questions - as
if philosophy itself were now a collocation. I also wanted texts that I
could not read, as you say, except in part - so that whatever might be the
'thing in itself' is shown to be a kind of colonialism or production
itself.

I hope this is clear. These are also done with more than respect for
native Hawaiian culture and cultural practice. Could you say more about
hanai?

Agree with you about the Principia. It was first of all an answer to
Frege, not based on it - the theory of types developed as a way to deal
with Russell's paradox of classes. Second, it's a far richer book of
course than we're giving it credit for - along with Boole, Cantor, and
Peano, it forms the basis of modern logic. Part of its success is the
development of a mathematical formalism itself.

And you're right about Godel of course - but the idea of a firm axiomatic
foundation of mathematics was problematized by his results (even though he
was a Platonist), as well as by Tarski, Skolem, Church, etc. -

IN THE PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM

Grandpa is no longer dead, but dressed in a fine wool suit.  He presides
over the dinner table while Grandma shuttles to serve, and gazes upon us as
if we were each a continent, and together the whole world was indeed his. I
guess Grandpa knew nothing of continental drift, of plates in constant
horizontal movement.  Continents, after all, are pieces of a jigsaw puzzle
that have been taken apart in other eras, with coastlines that would almost
click if pushed back together. We grind and bump, create seismic pressure.
New seas are birthed between us. Your daughters draw together after second
thoughts, and the pressure swells mountains Himalaya high.  This ritual,
it's nothing new, nothing that hasn't been going on since the beginning.
Things bigger than we are feel the forces, the movement of the plates.
Someday, Grandpa, Italy will lose its boot, California its tip, but on the
bright side, Australia and Asia might become one.

NATURE AND SUPERNATURE
As we look around wherever we are, we see bodies, objects, things, people,
animals: There are cars and houses, plants, trees, and birds, clouds in the
sky and sun on high, and on and on we can make an endless list. All these
constitute the world around us, and they extend from the center of the earth
and dust bits to the very ends of the universe and the most distant galaxy
imaginable. All this is part of Nature.
Is there anything more than what we see and feel as tangible entities? Yes
there are: Like beauty, music, notions of truth and justice, love, hate and
thought. What are these intangible, insubstantial items that are no less
real in our experience as sentient beings? They too are part of the natural
world, one could argue, for none of these would have arisen without the
materials that constitute  the universe. Love and lunacy are surely not
material things, but they could never arise in a world without neurons, and
that means electrons and protons, sodium and calcium, and all the rest of
it. Thus, ultimately, there is only Nature: so proclaim many in the
scientific establishment.
But this is not all that obvious to many who wonder about and reflect on
this mysterious universe where, by some magic mode, we enjoy and suffer for
a brief span of eternity. By we, I don't mean just the bone and flesh and
blood that embody us, and the skin and skull that encase it all. I mean
rather this individual entity that thinks and reasons, computes and creates
in its own fantastic mode: symbols, equations, and all. The  universe, with
all those twinkling stars and grandiose galaxies, spouting endless  energy
and whirling and wandering, all in accordance with perfect mathematical
laws: How did all this come to be, and with such balance and  elegance,
culminating in a mind that knows right from wrong and good from bad, or at
least thinks it does?
It arose in the hearts and minds of many ancient visionaries that there is
something beyond nature: a supernature, as it is called in Latin-derived
tongues. Aristotle called it metaphysis:  beyond-nature, because he believed
it to reside way beyond the stellar dome. Hindu thinkers described it as
alaukik: not of the world. Their word for Nature assumed its existence, for
Nature is srishti in Sanskrit, meaning that which has been created. That
supernatural something must be powerful enough to create the world and
oversee it too. Being beyond nature, it must also be intangible, and not
subject to any of the laws and rules that govern the world, and hence can
cause occurrences (miracles) that do not conform to the laws of nature.Every
traditional religion accepts some kind of supernatural entity. It seemed
reasonable to many thinkers to imagine the supernatural entity to be in some
ways very like us, and so this all-powerful, all-knowing creative principle
came to be envisioned as God.  Some Hindu seers pictured the world as the
play of the Supernatural (bhagvaan ki leelaa), even as Dante talked of
eternal God whose art Nature is (Deus aeternus, arte sua, quae natura est).
How can we know if the supernatural exists? One may believe, postulate, or
recognize that there are modes of perception beyond the ordinary sensory
channels. Through such extra-sensory perception (ESP), and only through it,
one can affirm the existence of supernature. From this perspective,
religious visions and revelations are instances where  supernature is
recognized. Some believe there are supernatural processes, like clairvoyance
and clairaudience, in which humans can participate. Once accepts all this on
the basis of intense personal experience, or because one is convinced that
the world is  richer and more complex than has been painted by naturalistic
science.
----------------------------------------------
NATURE AND SUBNATURE
Science gives a very different answer to the question, "What gave rise to
nature?" Whereas religion, in its inspiration, speaks of something above
nature, science, in its quest,  has found a good deal below nature in terms
of which the features of the world can be explained in minute details.
Thus, instead of supernature, science unveils subnature: a world in the core
of palpable matter. Physics has penetrated into the substratum of perceived
reality and discovered a whole new realm of entities thereunder, beyond the
imagination of the most creative minds of the past. Through sophisticated
labyrinths of theory and mathematics, aided by an array of experimental
ingenuities, science has uncovered a microcosm that is abundant in minute
bits which are not like sand grains, but are smeared out mini-clouds of
electric charge and other properties. That unseen world is dense with a
plethora of particles: bearing such names as hadrons, mesons, leptons, and
field-bosons. Hadrons and mesons are complex, made up of quarks, while
leptons are of two kinds: electrons and neutrinos. These ultimate bricks of
the substantial world are subject to fundamental forces, transmitted via
field-bosons called photons, gluons, W & Z, and gravitons.
From all this subnatural splendor arise the atoms of a hundred elements,
where negatively charged electrons whirl around positively charged nuclei.
There is a cosmic culinary complex, as it were, by which nature concocts an
incredible richness from atomic ingredients. These are the molecules of
compounds, forming salt and sugar, wine, water or whatever. All the
substances we see and feel, and a multitude that we don't, are made up of
molecules, mostly with two or more atoms.
A molecule barely stretches to a few millionths of a millimeter. The number
of molecules in a teaspoon of water is of the order of a trillion trillion:
more than there are stars in the entire universe.
Some molecules are mammoth and magical: Deoxyribonucleic acids or DNA are
stupendously large, nearly a hundred and twenty million times as massive as
a hydrogen atom.  With variations here and there, they get intertwined in
pairs, intertwine as spirals, often in a few thousand turns, forming a
structure known as the double helix. These are the most precious formations
in the universe, for they encode every bit of information pertaining to the
throb of life. The combined mass of all DNA molecules on earth is minuscule
compared to that  of all ocean water, but they are like the libraries of the
world: in them lie all the knowledge and information relevant to life.
Thus, science has uncovered that the nature we see and feel, admire and
enjoy is like a complex building, constructed from invisible components with
specific properties. Some of the molecular configurations at the basis of
life have blossomed into myriad patterns of beauty and complexity.  In one
of them is the miracle of the human brain  from which emerge  the associated
wonders of mind and thought and creativity.
The religious vision of supernature has instigated great art, glorious
music, epic poetry, colorful festivals, magnificent architecture, and more.
Scientific understanding of subnature has led to some of the most fantastic
wonders of technology from solid state electronics and lasers to computer
chips and much more.
Whether the notion of supernature emerges from subnature, or supernature
creates and sustains subnature, is the crux of the science-religion
dialogue.

Hi Stephen -

Just quickly, I want to make clear why I try to separate Barney's *intent*
from Barney's *work.*  I see the work as participating in the Hugo Boss
world, dressed in tall black leather military boots, and clearly,
indisputably, it does.  The Guggenheim, after all, overlooks Central Park on
Fifth Avenue.  I've previously described Hugo Boss' role in the cashmoney
world.  Now Barney himself said at one point that he intended to show that
the architecure is evil: Barney in a recent interview claims he was
fascinated and compelled in part by the blood running down the bare
lightbulb in Evil Dead II.  To him the image said the architecure itself
could be evil.  So maybe Barney wanted to show the architecture of the
Machine is evil.  I think the work ultimately shows that the evil is sexy,
sexier than I ever imagined it.

There's that sexual repression we've both described, and somehow that
repression is delivered by Barney as something sublime and beautiful,
including its horror.  I consider that to add to such repression's
glorification, whether or not Barney intended it.  Cruelty indeed keeps
coming up all over the work.  And it is very pretty, and we are enticed to
look closer, come under its gaze more and more.

I did not read your response yet in full but I will and will respond more
fairly.  In the meantime, I'm beginning to wonder about the work of Barney
with respect to Debord's Society of the Spectacle.

Thanks again Stephen, this thread is marvelous.

Thanks, Patrick, for what's probably a more considered and contextualized
look at Barney's Cremaster 3.  Yesterday, again here at the Castro Theater
in San Francisco for 1 & 2, I sat in a 2/3rds full house for the 4:15
showing - a great attribution to word of mouth and, I guess, the Guggenheim
to the west ripple-off effect.  (I have not read Peter S's Barney piece in
the New Yorker or most of the Art mag reviews of the work, but those are
still small frames in proportion to producing the afternoon audience on a
sunny, fog going into retreat day).

As much as I like the 3 and the iconic/symbolic bounce containing the work
from bottom to top inside the verticality of the Chrysler building,
Cremaster 2 I even like better. As Michael Kimmelman argued in his NY Times
piece - in which he connects this work of Barney to the earth or land
artists working in the West (Smithson, De Maria, Heizer & Judd) - Cremaster
is cradled in the mountainous and arid landscapes that impinge on and occupy
the Great Basin - Utah's Bonneville Flats and the south to north ascension
of the Rockies on into Canada. The camera eye goes back and forth between
panoramic and a close-in intimate view of the immense, fluid and
metamorphosic presence of the material landscape - salt, ice, water, cloud -
as if they were all different versions of syllables and as concretely uses
as in a  Coolidge poem.  Panoramically - through out the movie - the lens
varies between integrating sky and land in either the dark laden,
threatening manner of an Alfred Beirdstadt or the sensual convergence of
cloud, pink light and water of O'Keefe (which the camera converts 180
degrees into a vertical ovulum.) Much of it is spell-bindingly done.

I dwell on the landscape not as symbolic ornament - though Barney creates
sculptural signatures and rituals from within its materials - what is
mesmerizing and compelling about the film is the absence of separation
between the landscape and its narrative evocations. In one of the relatively
few spoken dialogues - an 1890's Victorian theosophist woman appears in the
darkend after hours in the pavilion of the Columbia Exposition to accuse
Houdini of being a fraud because his escapes are not composed of a real
metamorphosis. Houdini expounds from the stage that she is wrong, that when
he is locked in the box, "I become that box", the very wood of it, etc. This
said juxtaposed against glacial ice formations are dripping into streams
over rock) In that sense - going back to Patrick's question about the
authenticity of Barney's use of surface - I think Barney and this work are
everything but consumed by the material integrity of the landscape - and
it's that fidelity embraces the eyes to watch his processes so closely.

If Cremaster (Chrysler) 3 takes its iconic scope in the ingestion of
Metropolis, it's probably too simple to say that Cremaster 2 is its western
gothic counterpart. Embattled within the landscape - and against an
inheritance of 19th and 20th century western myths - there is a genuine
sincerity to engage the artifice and detritus of manifest destiny and its
cruel cast of cohorts. Instead of formalized architecture(in 3/4) of the
Masonics or or Wright's western organic curves manifested in the Guggenheim,
Barney is constructing his own unique tools, machinery, architectural shapes
and devices out of salt, ice, fiber glass and some Beuy's like bee's wax.
(Well there are there are the rows of curved wooden curved benches inside
the Mormon Tabernacle and the Victorian gingerbread). The machinery, the
tools, the sculptural salt enclosures are each used to perform implied acts
of savagery on their captives. (As if all the saddles and stirrups had been
turned upside down and their lone riders done-in - juxtaposed against a
magnificent glass saddle in the dance hall - drawing the two partners around
and around in a perfectly patterned two step to the sweetest imaginable
western romantic courtship croon).
I am not about to say what Cremaster 2 is "about" in terms of where one
arrives at the work's end. (In a certain way nothing in it seems to imply
any kind of end). The word 'cruelty' keeps emerging - the sadistic cruelty
of romantic sexual repression, the sadistic cruelty of and around Gary
Gilmore (himself and his his ritual community exorcism) - juxtaposed around
Houdini's aging and strained attempts to use elaborate sculptural devices to
liberate what? (his soul?) from the material cycle.
Interesting I find the occurrence of old and neo western cattle brands and
ranch logos that inevitably attach themselves to cruel (boundary setting)
behavior. In this context - instead of the romance of the western visual
romances of O'Keefe and Beirdstadt - for example - I get an echo of Mardsen
Hartley - his romance with the German officer in those paintings with the
various Kaiser uniform insignia - which I think are read as glimpses of
social & personal power, control and violence (a discussion that is left out
of most visual discourse in romantic American 19th and early 20th century
painting).  Barney, I think, brings those factors into play in ways that I
think are both baroque and compelling - and if it weren't for the beauty in
the production, mostly heartless, scary and chilling.     I also left the
theater thinking of Herzog's world of urban terrors and Fassbinder's heroic
ambitions - blending the eye of the film as one does to the street, Castro
Street and all of its characters in full manifest in the early evening sun.

Anyway, Patrick - I wouldn't push jading Barney's set with all the
money-collector-museum-fashion camouflage that his current success invites -
I (perhaps obviously) see/hear a real there there.

Dear Alan--I appreciate the truth of your statement that there is much
American imperialism to be found in this neck of the ocean, and that
theology was used as an instrument of colonization in Hawai`i--witness
the translation of the Bible into Hawaiian, the influx of New England
missionaries in the 19th century and so on.  But I suspect that your
efforts to sympathize by way of using Hawaiian words taken from a
grammar (itself a colonial apparatus, perhaps) would not be as welcome
as you might wish among Hawaiians, since you might seem to be re-doing
what has already been done in an odd way.  Not knowing the language but
still writing in it is a dangerous thing, at least when it comes to a
white American writing in an indigenous language.  This may not seem
fair, but there's a long history to it.  The way in which "we" play
with languages is not the way in which languages are used here, and in
other colonized places, and "our" attempts to play our way out of
colonial practices often backfire.  It's a lesson that's been long and
difficult in the learning for me.

As for hanai practice, that's the way in which Hawaiians adopted
children.  It's "unofficial," but you see lots of obituaries, even now,
where the dead person's hanai children are listed.  Often these lists
are quite long.  As an adoptive mother and someone who writes about
adoption language, it's good to learn about non-western adoption
practices.

aloha, Susan Schultz

I own a Matthew Barney

. . . as it were.

I saw all of his movies and videos as soon as each was
released, I have the CD of his Ursula Andress opera
Cremaster, I've invoked him in my own criticism (see
the testicles conclusion to my Standard Schaefer
review), and I used to go to all the follow-up gallery
shows that accompanied the movie release (a Vaseline
nautilus benchpress gym equipment machine in a
refrigerated basement, Jacobin pigeons pecking about
in a gallery sideroom...).

Somewhere in the early '90s, I think it was, Barney
came to speak at the Graduate School of Arts studio
building at Columbia.  While he was waiting to be
introduced, he sat doodling in a notebook, somewhat
dragon-/creature-like doodles of a comic book sci-fi
variety.

That was during my astrologer phase, and I was going
around approaching celebrities who were anywhere on
the cusp of the drag/transvestite/transsexual world,
asking to do their charts for this "research" I was
doing.  (In a Village Voice interview about his
apartment, Charles Busch referred to my visit to his
apartment to do his chart as the anonymous "astrologer
who . . .".)

After his talk, I approached Barney.  To give me his
contact information (and possibly his birth stats,
although for some reason [I may have been scared of
him] I'm fairly sure I never did his chart, and I
definitely never followed up with contacting him), he
wrote his number and address on the back of a slip of
paper that he tore from his notebook: thus, the
Matthew Barney in my collection: on the back of the
torn paper, there were his doodles.


He was much more lean than he appears in his recent
photographs and in the Chrysler movie.  An impression
of beads of perspiration, taut forehead.  He was
wearing a short sleeve T-shirt over a long sleeve
pull-over, one of the first time I ever noticed that
style.

The timbre of his energy was one of the most memorable
things about him.  It was kind of scary.  He seemed
really wired, and it was hard to decide if he was just
on drugs (which would be innocent, normal, and
expected) or if there was more driving it, as appeared
to be the case.

The main way that becomes relevant to this Poetics
List discussion was during his lecture and the Q-&-A.
He was meticulously delineating all these abstruse
connections between the characters and imagery that he
uses; going into much greater detail than anyone could
possibly make use of, about these characters, satyrs,
zeppelins; and, graduate students being graduate
students, questions about, say, the ~Large
Glass~/Duchampian-like aspects of these
confabulations, were answered with only further
mystification and ~emphatically,~ emotionally
reasserted intricacies of these art fantasias of his.

. . . So that people began to become sort of nervous.
Like, "Hey, maybe he's not kidding."  The expectation,
jaded as we all sought to be, was that what we were
hearing were ironies, tongue-in-cheek, . . . but he
kept coming back with this intensity and stressing all
the more passionately (delusionally?) how the football
player with the two zeros on his jersey related to
Houdini and how Houdini related to . . .

The combination of Barney's stunning model good looks
and this sense of danger.  One walked out in this
state of cognitive dissonance, like, he ~can't~ be as
crazy as he sounds.  It's ~got~ to be ambiguous.


So, from this limited first-hand encounter with him,
"personal cosmology" seems terribly apropos.  Despite
my own theory-mania,--- I suspect that it's wrong to
overlay the pure libido fantasia that's there on the
surface (depths) of the work with highly theoreticized
critique, or to expect that there are layers of meta-
commentary in his work, . . . at least as far as the
relation of the art to the artist here.  In a way,
what he exudes, in person, is Noble Savage.  There's
also talk about gender and sexuality: the assumption,
the nearest approximation is that he would be gay,---
but, after seeing him, there was this perhaps more
unsettling intuition that something funkier than that
might be going on, something non-mating, like
Narcissism.  The hermeticism, which was compellingly
important to him, seemed to fascinate him deeply.  (I
would imagine the Masonic symbolism in his work should
be regarded like the Masonic symbolism in Mozart, in
~The Magic Flute.~)

He seemed, in a way, not to be completely divided up
into strata of conscious/unconscious the way we expect
a person to be.  He could have been talking in his
sleep with that lecture, almost.

Kirby -

Re: you edit...STET!  -1 x -1 = 1 because negating a negative is a positive.
'p iff (not(not p))' is a way of saying this in logic (iff - if and only if,
or, the first and second are necessary and sufficient for each other).  If
you ride a bike, then it is not true that you don't ride a bike, and vice
versa.  So when a bad thing happens to a bad something it's a good: a good
way for a teacher to explain the mathematical idea.  (As a rule this might
not be the best thing when applied to people, however.)  You were right the
first time.

Frege in relation to Marx?  I laughed at this at first, but considering some
of the readings of Marx that try to show that Marx heavily depended upon the
language of anti-Semitism in critiquing capitalism, maybe such a statement
is not so funny.  Marx probably perceived class as less porous in 19th
century Europe than we do in 21st century America, which would explain some
differences.

My library on Frege is fairly limited, as is my knowledge.  On-list you
might try Alan Sondheim, who is very well-read in this area (as in many
others).  Or you might try the sci.logic group discussion list, which
includes some more serious logic scholars who would undoubtedly be able to
answer you questions on Frege.

Maybe we could read Frege's descriptions of functions as functions between
sets and therefore the functions are the pore-makers for sets.

Russell's paradox about the set of all sets that are not members of
themselves (a barber who shaves all and only the people of a town who don't
shave themselves is a sort of Schrodinger's barber who does and does not
shave himself) was apparently a response to Frege and caused great problems
for Frege.  Such a set is a member of itself iff it is not a member of
itself.  Paradox!  Frege could not escape this problem.  Given that set
theory leads to a contradiction, it then makes all statements true (p and
not p imply all concepts, as Frege would call statements).  And then we
don't have a theory anymore.  Russell developed the theory of types to solve
this problem which is a significant part of the Principia Mathematica.

Fascinating story about your friend.

Subject: Re: Frege Question

Patrick Herron,

This was an enormously interesting post. I'm one of these people who are
terrified of mathematics, but also really interested in it.  It began in
fourth
grade with the problem of -1 x -1 = 1.  How could it be, when I couldn't
find
any real world adequation for this.  I talked with a high school math
teacher at
a picnic recently and tossed him the question and he said, when a bad thing
happens to a bad guy, it's a good thing, so you see, it is adequate.  -1 x 1
=
-1, I asked.  When a bad thing happens to a bad guy, that's also bad.  1 x
1?
When a good thing happens to a good guy, that's good, too.

I wish my fourth grade teacher had thrown that at me.  I got wary of math,
instead.  At any rate, I really liked your note.  I'm going to print it out
and
keep it.  I have wondered endlessly about Frege. I've read only a few
essays,
but really enjoyed them.  Lyotard as you probably know uses him as a source.

What do you think Frege would say about the Marxist idea of classes?  Would
he
buy them as do-able (is that the word?) sets?

Would he say that race, gender and class (our only aesthetic criteria as far
as
I can make out these days) are understandable entities?  They all seem to be
under attack -- race is constructed -- I guess.  I knew a guy who ran an
all-black church but who was technically white, for instance.  His parents
died
in a car-crash, and he was raised by a black family.  He went to Morehouse
College and wasn't accepted by the blacks, he said, and yet he was
completely
black, culturally.  And he wasn't completely rejected, either.  He was,
after
all, the chosen pastor of an African Episcopal congregation.  And yet in
terms
of affirmative action reports he was considered white.  Meanwhile gender
appears
to be completely porous -- or has been assumed to be.  Men can become women,
and
women men, and according to some theorists, are always popping back and
forth.
And poor people get rich, and rich get poor.  What does Frege do with such
seemingly porous sets?  I have wondered about this forever, but have never
gotten around to doing the math, so to speak, or in other words, reading
Frege.
There seems to be so many prerequisites to doing this -- although he does
have
some essays that don't depend too heavily on math.  Would you have any
recommendations?  I think his ideas of set theory are amazingly coherent and
sharply defined, but they also have lots of paradoxical kinks in them --
like
the one about the barber -- or was that Russell's joke?  These guys are a
little
outside my area -- I'm mostly interested in aesthetic theory.  I thought so
beautiful his description of Venus and the morning star as one object but
with
different frameworks of meaning around them (this is what Lyotard uses to
talk
about the slipperiness of politics of identity, I think, or at any rate,
that's
what I was thinking about when I read it).

The only reply I can give is this - first the grammar is written by a
Native Hawaiian; second, it's not by far the only source I'm using; third,
the point is not the Hawaiian language itself, obvious, but the English
and other languages that surround it; fourth, it's not about my
'sympathizing', which I honestly feel incapable of - that, for me, would
be a colonialism itself; and fifth, it's _is_ about the concepts of
philosophy - please see the titles, and the recognition that "philosophy"
itself is an obviously western word with Greek/IE origins.

If this is a colonialism, I apologize; but I don't see that it is - I
tried to make it clear (and with the surrounding texts as well) that it is
about notions of philosophy and their simultaneous exhileration/damage, as
well as my/our ignorance.

The words by the way are not from the grammar at all, but from other
sources, again written by Hawaiians. And one of the main books is from the
library of Armand Schwerner, who also used and worked with languages and
languaging. This is not a defense of my practice, but simply to indicate
sources. I can send you a list of the five books (not including Net
sources) I'm using, all written by Hawaiians, but this would also be, for
me, the need for a proof of intentions, which is also problematic.

Avant gardener=20

Born in the Bahamas, Ian Hamilton Finlay left school in Scotland aged
13. He published short stories and poetry before establishing himself as
a conceptual artist, and fought a long battle with the authorities over
his horticultural haven in the Pentlands. Now 77, he has accepted a CBE.
James Campbell tracks him down

James Campbell
Saturday May 31, 2003
The Guardian

Next to the gate that opens on to Ian Hamilton Finlay's farm at the
southern fringe of the Pentland Hills, where he has created his
celebrated garden of poetry and sculpture, stands an oblong brick
monument about three feet high. A bronze plaque depicts a machine gun. A
line from Virgil runs across the top - "Flute, begin with me" - and
below the barrel, which punningly suggests a flute, is the date February
4 1983.=20

The monument commemorates the First Battle of Little Sparta, which took
place here when the sheriff officer of Strathclyde region attempted to
seize works of art from Finlay's property, in lieu of rates amounting to
=A3500 due on a farm building. The region categorised the structure,
originally a barn, as an art gallery, whereas Finlay claimed it was a
garden temple. His garden was "a place apart, if you like a religious
place", and the building in question "developed naturally into one which
performs the normal functions of temples in classical gardens". The
sheriff officer, acting in the role of bailiff, was thwarted by a
formidable group of Finlay's supporters known as the Saint-Just
Vigilantes, after the French revolutionary. The farm, marked on maps as
Stonypath, was now known as Little Sparta.=20

The Saint-Just Vigilantes (Saint-Just is remembered for the pure, indeed
"spartan", nature of his philosophy) rallied behind Finlay in other
battles, of which there have been many. "I used to be quite pugnacious.
I'm not now," Finlay admits sheepishly, sitting in the glass-covered
porch of the farmhouse, situated about 25 miles southwest of Edinburgh,
in gorgeous hilly countryside. Last year, he suffered a stroke that
reduced his fighting capacity, but there is still a blend of mischief
and obstinacy about his face, which has at times more the air of a child
than of a 77-year-old man. Judging by the activity in the outbuildings
and the separate portions of the garden, as he prepares for its summer
opening, his activity is uninterrupted. He takes delight in discussing
his various "pugnacious" encounters - with publishers, famous poets, the
Scottish Arts Council. The Battle of Little Sparta, for which a medal
was struck, was his glorious campaign.=20

"It was an actual battle," Finlay says. "The sheriff officer came up to
the gate here, but the vigilantes were guarding it and so he couldn't
get in. I was concealed in the barn. The idea was that he had to find me
in order to carry out his duties, and of course he couldn't find me. We
had constructed a panzer tank, and were letting off explosions and so
on." Journalists and television cameras were present to record the
fighting. When the sheriff officer felt he had absorbed as much enemy
fire as any local government official should be expected to in one day,
he made a temporary surrender, saying he was leaving but that he would
be back. "But the farmer from over the hill had parked his tractor
behind the sheriff officer's car, and taken the wheels off the tractor.
So he had trapped the sheriff officer in Little Sparta. It was a
thoroughly satisfactory day." Finlay called the place Little Sparta
"because Sparta was traditionally the enemy of Athens, and everybody
knows Edinburgh as the Athens of the North. So this was established as a
separate state."=20

The sheriff officer returned six weeks later, on budget day, when the
attentions of the media were focused on the House of Commons, and began
a second assault. The vigilantes were absent, leaving the defence of
Little Sparta to the "Dryads", statuettes of classical divinities
dressed in modern camouflage. Several art works, not all of which
belonged to Finlay, were removed from the garden temple. The fallout
continued for many years.=20

Finlay is almost as well known for his pugnacity as his poetry, which is
nowadays difficult to obtain (he has occasionally stood in the way of
its re-publication). There is a Scots word that describes him: thrawn;
stubborn, uncompromising. As the writer and gardener Charles Jencks
remarked at the time of the Little Spartan wars, Finlay and his wife Sue
"do attract hostility, like a lightning rod attracts electricity". But,
he added, "once the first shot has been fired against them, they leap to
their symbolic battle-stations. Quite rightly, the garden temple is
dedicated to Apollo - 'his music, his missiles, his muses' - revealing
all sorts of latent meanings in this sometime god of war and music, the
namesake of Apollo in the American space programme."=20

Finlay was born in 1925 in Nassau in the Bahamas, and brought back to
Scotland as a child, growing up in both city and country. His earliest
memory is of sitting on the deck of a schooner. His grandfather worked
at Hopetoun House, an 18th-century mansion not far from Edinburgh,
designed by the Adam brothers, and Finlay speculates that his interest
in the classical "may have been partially inspired by memories of the
grounds, the lands, the deer, the classical house - who knows?" His
education after the age of 13 took the form of one year at Glasgow
School of Art. "My first job was working in a commercial art studio - I
was the 'boy' who got the clean water for the artists. Later, I worked
for a year in advertising, as a copywriter, and learned something about
brevity." When war broke out, he was evacuated to Orkney, and later
joined the Royal Army Service Corps. As a soldier, he met the writer
Derek Stanford, who recalls Finlay as "a fair-haired and faunlike
creature". From looking pitiful one minute, "his eyes and face would
swiftly twitch into wild vivacity and mirth". If Finlay's lifelong
affection for fishing boats, which recurs throughout his visual art, can
be attached to his memory of the schooner, then his later fixation on
warships, fighter jets and panzer tanks, he suggests, echoes his
military experience.=20

Among the poets he befriended at the end of the war was Hugh MacDiarmid,
who was best man when Finlay married his first wife, Marion. As a
teenager, Finlay was apt to identify himself as a painter more than a
poet. His first serious literary work came in the form of short stories,
published in 1958 in a book with a card cover and the pages stapled
together. Like much of his writing, The Sea-Bed and Other Stories was
put out by an obscure publisher, has never been reissued, and is very
rare. Finlay's stories often feature a young protagonist who is forced
to confront a problem posed by the social world. They have a quality
that might be called canny naivety. Poverty creates the atmosphere, as
much as the rural setting. "The Money", for example, begins: "At one
period in my life, as a result of the poverty I was suffering, it became
impossible for me to tell a lie." Finlay has described himself as, "in a
wee homemade way, a sophisticated person". His references are equally to
the world beneath his feet and the world in his head. "I write poems
that demand that people know what has been done in the literature and
the art of the past and present." Stephen Bann, professor of history of
art at Bristol University, who has written widely on Finlay, says that
he "wants us to take our art full of the richness that comes from
historical reference. But he also renews the historical reference by
confronting it with everyday experience. The world of the French
symbolist painters and poets can be recharged with meaning by the simple
image of a Scottish fishing boat. It is a matter of creating a bridge
between the symbolic and the real."=20

The same combination of erudition and homemade charm in The Sea-Bed
directs Finlay's first book of poems, The Dancers Inherit the Party,
issued by a small press when he was 35. They are brief, often funny
poems. One, "Mansie Considers the Sea in the Manner of Hugh MacDiarmid",
takes a playful swipe at his old mentor, with whom he had by now fallen
out, and who had declared himself an enemy of Finlay and all his works:=20

The sea, I think, is lazy,

It just obeys the moon=20

- All the same I remember what Engels said: "Freedom is the
consciousness of necessity."=20

Finlay became closely associated with a group of avant-garde American
writers, loosely clustered around the Black Mountain poet Robert
Creeley. In 1961, he established the Wild Hawthorn Press in Edinburgh
with Jessie McGuffie, and published collections of poems by Objectivists
and Black Mountaineers, such as Louis Zukofsky, Lorine Niedecker and
Jonathan Williams. The words of Creeley and the San Francisco poet
Robert Duncan endorsed The Dancers Inherit the Party , rather than those
of any Scottish writer. At the same time, Finlay set up a poetry
magazine called Poor. Old. Tired. Horse (POTH), after a line in a poem
by Creeley. The Scottish poet Edwin Morgan, a contributor to POTH,
recalls: "To some, its surprise element, with each issue being in a
different format, seemed flighty, which it wasn't. It opened up a scene
and was part of the revitalised Scottish culture of the 1960s."=20

Of his American associates, Finlay says: "They liked my poems, they came
to visit me in Scotland, they were kind to me. At the same time, the
Scots poets were being unkind. Scotland has never been kind to me. I
don't know why." Interviewed for BBC radio in 1972, Finlay set out his
position on his native land, a position that has shifted only a little:
"I feel on the edge as regards the Scottish scene, but as regards the
world I feel in the centre. I seem on the edge because I'm in the
centre." POTH published "lyrical poetry from all over the world. The
stand I have always taken is in favour of 'pure art', and this is what
causes the prickles in Scotland, because the Scots don't like pure art,
and they don't trust it." Morgan believes the "rejection" Finlay feels
and has long felt "is at least arguable. It is true that since he moved
more and more from being 'writer' to being 'artist', he is more likely
to receive commissions for public artworks from Berlin than from
Edinburgh, and that is bad, but on the other hand his poems and stories
are in Scottish anthologies, there are appreciative articles on him in
Scottish literary and art journals. In the 60s he had an uphill
struggle, against a heavy-handed artistic conservatism suspicious of the
lighter touch, humour, puckishness, paradox."=20

The intermediary stage in Finlay's transition from "writer" to "artist"
was concrete poetry. Also, he was making small models, and in 1963 had
an exhibition of "toys", which he called "little things of no account in
themselves, yet true to my inspiration, which was away from Syntax
towards 'the Pure'". That year, he published Rapel , a thoroughly visual
foray into concrete poetry, and Standing Poem I , his first poem-card.
There followed, mostly from his own Wild Hawthorn Press, "kinetic
booklets" and poster poems. In 1964, he exhibited a "poem in sandblasted
glass". A typical piece of metamorphosis is seen in a book let called A
Pretty Kettle of Fish : Finlay took the trademark of the Scottish
Agricultural Industries, a four-pronged pitchfork with the bold letters
S A I in each of the three spaces. He reproduced the emblem, but with a
handwritten L at the end (hence, SAIL), calling the resulting piece
"Land / Sea". He has also pioneered the one-word poem with an extended
title: "One Orange Arm of the World's Oldest Windmill / autumn". Morgan,
who has become the more familiar face of Scottish concrete poetry, says:
"It was I who first told Finlay about concrete poetry, and although we
both plunged in and enjoyed it, we went different ways. He soon moved
out from the printed page into cards, posters, and then
three-dimensional freestanding objects. I was more willing in my
concrete poems to allow for strangeness and suggestion, and especially
for sound-effects, which were not important for Finlay."=20

Finlay is uneasy with the suggestion that his increasing interest in the
plastic arts meant a renunciation of literature. "I never thought of it
as a move away from literature. I was reckoned to have left behind
written forms, but that's not the way I see it." He is happy to call
himself a poet - "a poet who wants to build lochs and make a garden ...
these things seem to me to be natural extensions of my poetry. I would
write rhyming poems now quite cheerfully if they came to me." As Morgan
sees it, Finlay "never gave up words but he stretched the idea of poetry
to extremes. He became, perhaps, a conceptual artist, where it is not
the hand of the artist but an idea, often a striking metaphor, that is
important".=20

His conceptualism extended to his battle with MacDiarmid. During the
1962 Edinburgh festival, the older poet wrote to a friend that "Ian
Finlay and his friends ... hope to stage an anti-MacDiarmid
demonstration" in the capital. Finlay, having circulated a letter to
press and radio, had elicited a banning order from the Edinburgh police.
In fact, the protest was, in his own word, "mythological". MacDiarmid
responded by describing the poetry of Finlay and his associates as
"utterly vicious and deplorable". Finlay now expresses much admiration
for MacDiarmid, with whom he made his peace before the latter's death in
1978.=20

In 1966, he and his second wife Sue, whom he had met two years earlier,
having separated from Marion, bought the five-acre farm at Stonypath. He
had in mind the model of the 18th-century landscape gardener and poet
William Shenstone. "Everything was derelict. We started from scratch. It
was a question of doing things without money." For many years he
scarcely left Stonypath, though he countered the notion that it had
become his "retreat" with one of his "Unconnected Sentences of
Gardening": "Certain gardens are described as retreats when they are
really attacks." At Stonypath, he discovered that "you can change a bit
of the actual world by taking out a spade of earth". Finlay formed a
small loch, which he named Lochan Eck, after his son Alec. Over the
years, as the garden took shape, sculptures and carved poems were
introduced. Most imposing of all is the assembly of massive fragments of
irregularly cut stone, facing a hillside, made by one of his main
collaborators, Nicholas Sloan. On each stone is incised a single word,
so that together they read: "The Present Order Is the Disorder of the
Future. Saint-Just." Upslope from Lochan Eck are seven brick turrets,
bearing the names of "camouflaged flowers" -"verleand", "incomap"
(anagrams of lavender, campion) and so on. On top of each turret is a
bronze machine gun. Every turn of a corner at Little Sparta is an
aesthetic adventure. A tiny wooden bridge across a stream bears a poem
("lines of Foam / strings of Foam / strands of Foam") while another
bridge, consisting of two planks, has the motto on each: "That which
joins and that which divides is one and the same." A sundial takes the
shape of a Madonna, with the words "Hour Lady". There is no end to it,
and no end to the "improvements" that Finlay carries out.=20

As with the poem-cards, which have drawings of fishing boats or pansies
(metamorphosing into panzers), the sculptural work is always carried out
in collaboration with craftsmen. Though his name is attached to hundreds
of sculptural works, Finlay never does the practical work himself. Ron
Costley, now the typographer at Faber and Faber, began working with
Finlay more than 30 years ago. "Collaboration is one of the least
understood aspects of Ian's work. It's all done by correspondence. He
has the germ of an idea. He will describe it in a letter. If the project
includes a drawing, he will send references, perhaps a text or a picture
torn from a book. He will also suggest an idiom for the lettering -
perhaps from Greek inscriptions. It works because Ian is very clever at
choosing the right collaborator for the job." He has worked with the
letter-carvers Brenda Berman and Annet Stirling, the printmaker Gary
Hincks and the ceramicist David Ballantyne, among others. Finlay usually
makes the approach. "I see their work somewhere, in an exhibition or a
catalogue, and I write to them. I begin by asking them to do something
quite modest, and if it's good I go along with them. They are not so
much artists in their own right as craftsmen. Sometimes they want to
develop into artists, but I don't like that. I want them to stay as
craftsmen. I don't look down on craftsmen - not at all." Costley has
never doubted his place in the enterprise: "You are working with him,
not for him. It's not just a job."=20

While Finlay insists on calling himself "a wee, old-fashioned poet",
others have taken the task of discussing his work into labyrinths of
exposition. A typical passage in the most widely distributed book on his
work, A Visual Primer by Yves Abrioux, goes like this: "Metaphor is
transference. The distance it incorporates by transporting words or
meaning into a context where they do not literally fit explains its
aura, hanging between its verbal and semantic levels. Finlay pays close
attention to metaphor." Ultimately, Finlay's aim is to plant poetry in
the natural world. He wishes his work to be taken as "something that can
be used by society", citing as examples the sundial poem at Canterbury
and the poem on Biggar High Street, near Stonypath. Part of the
resentment he feels towards Scotland results from being deprived of
opportunities to put his work to good use. His own garden aside, there
are few public works by Finlay in Scotland. The most extensive display
in a natural setting in Britain is at Stockwood Park in Luton, which
houses Finlay's Improvements , a collection of six pieces in a green
expanse, made in collaboration with Nicholas Sloan.=20

The visitor who goes there after Little Sparta sees how Finlay is apt to
transfer motifs from one setting to another. The practice of placing a
sculpted column-base at the foot of a tree is seen at Luton, at
Stonypath, and also at sites in Holland and elsewhere. A poem originally
printed on a card might also be viewed in neon installation in Germany,
and on the door panels in Finlay's kitchen - made in each case with a
different collaborator. Several partnerships are active at the same
time, although the craftsmen do not necessarily come to Stonypath. "Some
I've never even met," he says. The result seldom turns out different
from how he expected, but occasionally a piece has to be destroyed,
which can be expensive. "The turnover is immense," says Costley, "but I
believe the profit margin is quite small, or was until recently, and
practically all of it is ploughed back into the work." The question of
authorship in Finlay's production has been raised; at least one
collaborator has expressed dissatisfaction at the dual attribution.
Finlay points out that other artists use collaborators and don't
acknowledge them. "I always do. Shenstone didn't make the inscriptions
in his garden - he wrote the inscriptions, but somebody else carved
them. Nor did Capability Brown make the sculptures in his gardens. So
it's quite natural for me to collaborate." Bann believes "one of
Finlay's greatest strengths is his ability to range over a variety of
techniques that is far broader than any one person could master. The
best of his collaborators have always realised this, and valued the
opportunity to deepen the meanings of their products."=20

Among many skirmishes with the outside world, the one that hurt Finlay
most occurred in 1987, when he was commissioned by the French Ministry
of Culture to design a garden as part of the celebrations of the
bicentenary of the French Revolution. The garden was to be at
Versailles, site of the Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789. It
seemed a perfect project for an artist who self-consciously has one foot
in the classical past, and the other in the modernist (or revolutionary,
or indeed avant-gardening) present. However, a French magazine, Art
Press, organised a campaign against him, claiming to have detected in
his work an unhealthy fascination with Nazi iconography. The magazine's
editor was Catherine Millet, who has since achieved greater fame with
The Sexual Life of Catherine M. Finlay sued his defamer (a disgruntled
collaborator) for slander and won a nominal victory in the French
courts, but the valuable commission was lost.=20

Finlay's use of imagery and language associated with warfare and the
Nazis had caused stuttering and frowns among the public and critics
before the Versailles incident. Stepping from the farmhouse at Stonypath
into the first garden, the viewer is greeted by a stone that says
"Achtung Minen!" (Beware of mines). Model fighter planes rest on
plinths, aircraft carriers serve as bird-tables and machine guns peep
out from shrubs. What level of irony is being plumbed? Finlay
corresponded with Hitler's architect, Albert Speer, who had made a
garden at Spandau prison, from which emerged Finlay's Third Reich
Revisited series (1982). Does he worry about that and certain other
series being misunderstood? What, for example, is the significance of a
variation on Poussin's pastoral scene, Et in Arcadia Ego, in which the
figures are replaced by a tank with SS insignia? Finlay is reluctant to
explain. "I wouldn't call it Third Reich Revisited if I worried about
what people might think. And why not put a tank into a pastoral setting?
Tanks are part of the world. Does the fuss worry me? Sometimes, but I
try not to let it get to me." Abrioux sees Third Reich Revisited, which
includes Hitler's Column and Little Fields at Nuremberg, as "an attempt
to raise, in a necessarily roundabout way, the questions our culture
does not want to put into idea form".=20

"The loss of the Versailles project did hurt him," says Jencks. "It
would have been right for him, and right for France, too. He would have
flowered at that moment. It is a calumny to accuse Ian of anti-semitism
or Holocaust exploitation. Like any poet, he naturally gravitates
towards the most electrically charged signs, and uses them. Most
positive symbols have been drained of power by our consumerist,
sensationalist culture, but these symbols - the SS lightning bolts, the
machine guns, and so on - retain their potency. Finlay is showing a
Britain without a belief in anything much. Hitler and the Nazis still
carry a very strong negative charge, but I think he uses the iconography
of violence and hatred far more responsibly than, say, the artists who
made up the Sensation exhibition."=20

It is only in the past few years that Finlay has taken to leaving
Stonypath. Sue, from whom he is now separated, was the gardener, and
also Finlay's envoy in the art world, visiting sites and meeting
dealers. Lately, however, he has been to London to receive the CBE, and
to Edinburgh to accept a Creative Scotland award from the Scottish Arts
Council, of =A330,000, which will help fund improvements to the garden. =
If
anything symbolises the peace that has broken out in the southern
Pentlands, it is surely this rapprochement with the Scottish Arts
Council, a body that at one time Finlay recommended be "destroyed". One
day, Little Sparta might even revert to being Stonypath.=20

Hi again, my response to David was rejected the other day cuz I'd reached me
limit, and I haven't had a chance to resend, here it is:

David, I'll be curious to know whether you change your mind by the end of the
article - to me the overall effect was to ridicule Stein as a scam artist and
to (more subtly) suggest to the general reading public that experimental
writing is a pastime for conservative dilletantes.  I've never dug deep enough
into Stein's biography to know whether she loathed FDR as Malcolm claims - but
I do know that she revered William James, one of the greatest
liberal/progressive/egalitarian thinkers ever (Malcolm erases this history by
quoting an anecdote about a test in James's class out of context, implying that
Stein was some kind of proto-hippie-slacker whom James was patronizing - this I
can say with absolute certainty is total bullshit.  No writer has ever
understood the aesthetic implications of The Principles of Psychology like
Stein did - James, for his part, praised Three Lives effusively).  Again, I
think what I'm reacting to in Malcolm is her profound intellectual dishonesty,
her total lack of interest in seeing nuance in such a complex writer and
person.

Yes, Patrick, I think you are right to question the seduction of the
material surfaces in Barney's work - especially the ravishment of the
western landscape that is maybe similar to Leni Riefenstahl=A0's mountains.
Today I actually met a woman art critic/historian who is doing a piece on
Barney's work in relationship to "30's Germany and fascist aesthetics" and
the Riefenstahl was her comparison converging with her complaint that the
reviewers of Barney's Gugenheim show had been been seduced by its beauty an=
d
had not gone below to examine the implications. "No one wants to talk about
narrative and risk an interpretation." (Barney least of all)
This work - in my opinion - is clearly not moved by a politics of liberatio=
n
on any apparent level (Jeffrey Jullich kind of confirms that in his very
interesting Barney encounter post of today. One would be hard pushed - for
example - to find a feminist presence in the work. Fraternity among men -
let alone a larger social bonding in any progressive democratic/humanist
sense - is a "non-starter" (as Ari Fleischer and Co like to repeat). No
Brecht is about to enter this picture.    At the same time the work is
deeply implanted inside and violently writhing/wrestling - and sometimes
petrified - within the national zeitgeist  - which I think accounts for par=
t
of its public arrest and attention.  (In a moment of highly polished
theater, President Bush arrives by jet on the aircraft carrier all dressed
up- picture perfect -  in a young man's flight suit, while in Quantanamo,
Msrs. Ashcroft & Rumsfeld are operating a little no exit cruelty pit for th=
e
alien accused.) Edgar Allan Poe is much more operative here than say the
transcendental Emerson.

If I can risk this, Barney's is an aesthetics of kinesthesia - it's led and
imaginatively conducted by materials that are seductive and
counter-seductive (brutal). These films are metamorphic sculptures. I guess
my gratitude and/or admiration is that he's willing to take on and let this
kinesthetic explore major icons within the national culture and to give the=
m
a transparent visual  shape, no matter how cruel the inner-workings. He's
pulling up the curtains wherever he moves. It's the exposure, the tension o=
f
the exposure that is embracing and done so with a frequently taunting
beauty. Ultimately, however, what appears to be a pretty picture, is not a
pretty picture at all.

You might not have liked the symbolic implications of the Chrysler Imperial
in 1966, but it was a hauntingly impressive, beautiful car.

Stephen Vincent

P.S. Barney - a Wyoming native - makes me remember that it the State that's
recently given us both the late Matthew Sheapard and the very living Dick
Cheney, both western icons that now go to the core of the violence under
those great mountains and skies - as well as now a much larger internationa=

I'm not entirely sure that's what happened in this piece. It seemed to me that the
point of greatest concern (for Malcolm and for the scholars highlighted here) was
Stein's friendship with a known Nazi collaborator, who provided for Stein and Toklas
during the occupation years. While Malcolm did register incomprehension at Stein's
work, she also acknowledged (in what seemed to be a pointed fashion, designed to
counterbalance her moments of incomprehension) how remarkable Stein's work was. In
fact, she often quoted Stein in a semi-worshipful way. The episode in class that you
mention seemed--again, to me--to be an example of Anne Carson-esque arbitrariness,
and not an example of hippie slackerdom. While Malcolm's work often has venom in it,
the emphasis here seemed to be on the story itself, rather than ad hominem
indictment of Stein. Or of experimental writing. But maybe I should check my
subscription--it could be they left the juicy parts out of my copy...

I heard an interesting story about a use of webcams. A journalist by the name of Rex Sorgath
had, by chance, set up some webcams in the town he lived in. Then a flood happened in his town.
And the flood set off fires. So the press could not cover the conflagration because the town
became inaccessible to outsiders owing to this combination of fire and water. But Sorgath was
able to cover the story via his webcams set up on rooftops. I believe he won a pulitzer for his
coverage of this story.

I saw Sorgath, quite a bit later (after the flood), demonstrate some more interesting use of
webcam tech. He did some programming using the Flash Communications Server. You'd connect to his
web page. And if you had a webcam, you could make it so that your video image was displayed on
the web page. Along with up to four other people who also had webcams and were also connected to
this page. And you could talk with them. And control their webcams, ie, scan around their place.
Kind of wacky public video conferencing. Public since anyone who connected to the webpage, even
if they didn't have a webcam, could see the five video images as long as they had the flash
plugin, and could hear the audio, if i recall correctly.

But it takes a weirdo like Rex Sorgath to open one's eyes to the possibilities. In short, it
pretty much takes an artist. Though our notion of what an artist is is, uh, well, changing. Like
Apollinaire said back in 1917,

"The divine games of life and imagination give free rein |to a totally new poetic activity.
{size=36} {enter=zoomOut} {pause=1} |The poet is he who discovers new joys\n even if they are
hard to bear. {enter=wipeLeft} |One can be a poet in any field: {enter=fade} {exit=none} |it is
enough that one be adventuresome {enter=none} {exit=none} |and pursue any new discovery....
{enter=none}"

When I met Sorgath, this was among journalists (except for me and Sue Johnson). The question of
'who/what is a journalist?' came up several times during this event. Just like the question of
'what is an artist?' comes up in similar situations. As you point out, technological dispersion
provides those who have the tech with the opp for audience.

Most of the boring webcam work we see does, i suppose, "swamp" the more exciting uses. But, uh,
Sorgath was flood fire and water compared with swamp. He was experimenting in his usually pretty
adventurous way when he lucked out. Like they say, gotta be good to be lucky, for the most part.

And most of the web pages one sees swamp the more interesting ones. same with print poetry.

what's journalism and what's a journalist, what's poetry and what's a poet...these are all
(happily) quite subject to the vicisitudes of technological/media/art dispersion--and audience
dispersion, as you rightly point out.

Another example of this blurring. http://cbchomedelivery.com is quite interesting as
'narrative'. Check out the 'murder in the neighbourhood' piece, for instance. This is a
relatively ambitious project by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Compare this piece as
'narrative' with other attempts at narrative on the web. It fares pretty well in the comparison.
Or check out http://www.donniedarko.com concerning 'narrative'. This is a Web site based on a
movie. The notion of storytelling cuts across media, arts, journalism...

I'm looking forward to being able to open a cell phone and have an interactive (300 dpi)
holographic space emerge from it the size of a monitor (cubed). Like the message involving
Princess Leah in the first Star Wars movie. Zoom to reach the ceiling.

Even still, it's the metaphysical space that one creates (rather than the physical space),
whether in print or hologram, isn't it. for me, anyway.

I think there's quite a bit of misunderstanding of McLuhan. I wonder how many people actually
have read him and thought about what he said. Don't know if you've ever checked out
http://vispo.com/writings/essays/mcluhana.htm . This is an essay I wrote about some of McLuhan's
basic ideas. I don't think the phenomenon you're pointing out is well-described as
"un-McLuhanesque".

McLuhan attempted not so much a history of western technology as a history of the noetic (or
cognitive) and sensorial (affective) changes brought about in the individual via technology.
Always before us in his work is an image of the individual human being. He wasn't satisfied with
trying to explore the ways in which technology determines culture but, instead, urges us to
examine ourselves and others for the signs of change within us. He wasn't interested in the
history of technology but in the history of people modified by technology. He was interested in
the ways that technology mediates relations between people and changes individual's world views
and nervous systems. In that sense, his work was humanistic.

There's a common misunderstanding that McLuhan believed that "the medium is the message".
McLuhan's famous remark that "The medium is the message" is typical of his overstatements. I
interpret the rhetorical intent of the slogan as an attempt to correct an imbalance. If there's
a great weight on a fulcrum and you want to displace the dead weight toward the centre, you must
apply considerable force from the extreme end. It was McLuhan's misfortune to have been
successful enough to displace the rock onto the top of his head.

Thanks for the update Mike, I guess this means that you've moved!
Congralations. Let me know if you are interested in any plantings. I have baby lavender,
columbine, several sunnyish ground covers to choose from, black-eyed susans, i
think an extra yucca, several varieties of grasses etc. etc. You'd just have
to bring potting soil with you, and maybe some pots, although I do have some
extra plastic pots around for transfer.
Wishing for warmth,
Karen

Max, I guess we just disagree on this, and I don't know whether I could sway
you or you me on the question of Malcolm's intentions.  My reading of it (and
I've just read it again to confirm) goes something like this: 1) she believes
that Stein's writing involved no genuine intellectual activity or effort,
indeed barely any cognition at all - "Stein didn't even type her work; she just
oozed into her notebooks and Toklas did the rest." 2) She fails to quote ANY of
the numerous examples or opinions which run counter to her narratives regarding
Stein's writing and politics (e.g., the real details of her involvement w/
William James, the high opinions of her work by authors her New Yorker readers
would recognize and admire; feminist and queer readings of the books) except in
the case of Dydo who acts as her straw man, having "a tart manner that
struggles with, and is defeated by, a deep underlying softheartedness." Wha???
Who the fuck writes like this?  3)She has a DEEPLY annoying habit of making
enormous generalizations as if the consent of her readers was not at all in
question: "Anti-semites, as is well known, often actually have best friends who
are Jews" [Oh yeah? I often actually have to disagree...]; "It is generally
agreed that, without Alice Toklas, Stein might not have had the will to go on
writing what for many years almost no one had any interest in reading" [almost
no one except half the 20th century writers in the Norton anthologies she no
doubt reveres; and of course it goes without saying that someone who wrote
thousands of pages of experimental writing would have simply written NONE of it
without the back-patting and house tending of her companion.  I wonder whether
Malcolm would say the same of the dozens, hundreds, of 20th c. male writers who
never lifted a finger except to pick up a pen?]; 4) the pop-psychologizing of
her childhood, her relationship with Leo, and how all this is the key to
reading her work, including books like Tender Buttons - well, it's just
un-fucking-bearable.

Truth be told, I think Malcolm is a run-of-the-mill dope and don't know why
I'm spending so much time on this except that Stein herself deserves it.

It's a biographical piece, not a critical one. I took the criticism she offered of
the work itself with a grain of salt--which wasn't hard to do, given that a large
portion of the article was devoted to the demonization of Toklas for "making" Stein
change "may" to "will" in one poem to avoid a reference to one of Stein's early
loves; to the suspicious friendship I mentioned before; to descriptions of
conversations with her scholars; and to stories of Toklas and Stein's real estate
misadventures. Malcolm has an ongoing interest in the way that a person's
personality may interfere with, or undercut, or give the lie to, that person's "life
pursuit" -- see In the Freud Archives, whose slow (but honest) roasting of Jeffrey
Moussaieff Masson earned her a seven-year lawsuit, or The Psychiatrist and the
Murderer, or portions of her recent Reading Chekhov, for examples. This seemed to be
just an expansion of that interest. She's not predominantly a literary critic, nor
does she pretend to be one--nor would it be appropriate for her to do so in The New
Yorker, home of E.B. White, the originator of a down-to-earth, unassuming voice that
has persisted from the magazine's inception, regardless of the layers that may have
accumulated over it over time. That voice doesn't have the range to speak about
Stein's more difficult, complex work, nor should it be expected to--the magazine can
only be *so* long. Your expectations may have been a little misplaced here...

a narrative of resistance
kari edwards

        recently I went to an =93I am a _________(fill in the blank) and =
I am=20
beautiful and sexy and fine and I am ok with who I am no matter what=20
you say=94 performance. the fill in the blank in this case could be any=20=

word that describes any category or any group of nouns that are a=20
category or any adjective that describes a group or category of nouns=20
that are recognizable within the repeatable patterns of situated=20
narratives, whether on a  part time or full time basis.  this is not a=20=

judgment about the =93I am this _________(fill in the blank)  and I am=20=

beautiful and sexy and fine and I am ok no matter what you say,=94 club,=20=

since it is a first step in seeing one=92s self other than as a formless=20=

form situated in social  shame.  it is more a question of, if this is=20
the stopping point, does it do anything more than reinforce the =93I=94 =
as=20
the ultimate achievement; where the end-game is the epiphany of late=20
capitalism; to become an all consuming self-controlling anorexic=20
life-form on automatic here to be the greatest consumer by buying one=92s=20=

way into endless cycle of unexamined representations of the grand tale;=20=

a maybe, a reiteration of the heroic journey, or a story with a moral? =20=

I am not interested in morals, morals situate one within the state of =20=

label placements and finality. as whatever said in a day in the life of=20=

p. writing an article for the psycalene quarterly: =93to the funeral =
ball=20
- to the bat-n-ball, hand shaken going on at the funeral ball.=94
                I am not interested in situating myself  or seeing =
anyone situate=20
themselves in a state of subjugation, =93or a felonious definition that=20=

creates a category.=94 on the other hand trying to escape from this=20
multi-labeling assembly line at the commodification factory is like a=20
fish trying to open a franchise of macdonlds . . . though this is not a=20=

probability, it might as well be possible.  the probable we live out of=20=

  has as many options as the impossible . . . . . we exist in the=20
probable of the planned out, knowing the outcome ahead of time. I want=20=

to explore the possibilities hidden away in dark rooms, the unnamed and=20=

unseen . . . . I want to experiment with new ways to articulate the=20
inarticulate that do not situate it in =93a larger than persephone cast=20=

iron cog with teeth of cement blocks,=94 and at the same time affirm our=20=

humanity while calling attention to flagrant lapses of=20
institutionalized thoughtlessness. whether we were dropped off here by=20=

someone's god, or by accident there is too much suffering and=20
destruction going on for it to be always about  the =93me=94 theme in=20
personal =93I=94 narratives.
        so then what is a narrative of resistance?  what is a narrative =
that=20
informs and resists at the same time?  what is this miracle and how did=20=

I get here? is there a stable body? can there be more than twenty=20
pronouns?
         words become important in the act of resistance or the =
corruption of=20
words, or what you can do with them, or not. and just for the record, I=20=

am a self proclaimed deviant and all that that can mean. it=92s just a=20=

word right? deviant is like queer, but more so; I deviate as much  as=20
possible from moral norms . . . . or social norms, right path, or a=20
proper code of conduct, proper spelling, right grammar, right way to=20
be, here to serve someone's god and country.  that does not mean=20
anything goes, it is still and always about reducing suffering.
        basically, the way things are going now, the implementation of =
the=20
social contract is not working, there is too much suffering and=20
destruction going on and I/we need to deviate from this path of=20
institutional subjugation.  in a day in the life of p., p. the main=20
character is =93referred to as sometimes, something, whatever - or =
both.=94=20
are we not at all times, a both or whatever sometimes? and a whatever=20
as we glide through our own positional grid, qualitatively changing=20
with each passing event. we can pick and / or choose (as much as one is=20=

able) multiple categorie(s) to situate in, if we choose to pick a=20
category at all. there is also the possibility that no matter how=20
positioned we think we are in category or our choosing, an individual=20
can experience a sudden sift in one=92s postion as one subjugated by=20
another's gaze into a different category. =09
=A0=A0  this dance with a narrative of resistance started for me when I=20=

=93discovered I was writing this secret diary, totally unaware of the=20
fact that I was keeping this secret diary . . . . (but) there was was=20
always this feeling I was doing something I didn=92t know I was doing.=94 =
I=20
began reading books that allowed me to say, =93oh, there are  others =
like=20
me, and they all did similar x, y, and z things.=94 finding these=20
connections with others are important, if not critical to resistance.=20
having a language to speak ones truth is a critical tool for=20
resistance, but it does not creates an environment of resistance if one=20=

stays in an identifiable category; just the opposite happens, one=20
becomes, =93I am this, I will always be this,=94 =93this is my story,=94 =
and =93I=20
am going to tell my story.=94 then there is a city full of stories, and=20=

television shows with everyone's story on it, all day all the time. =20
after reading numerous  =93x, y, and z things books,=94 what  I started =
to=20
notice was, all these  =93x, y, and z thing=94 books were more of the =
same=20
thing, then there were more books that said the same thing from a=20
different perspective, and all these books ended up on a bookself in=20
the back of =91barrens and nobles,=92 or those bookstores with rainbow=20=

flags out front...  another way of looking at this is, this is a=20
country of,  =93I am an island theme songs,=94 =93my story counts as =
possible=20
docudramas points,=94 =93I am an island in a special ocean=94 . . . . . =

effect. artificial boundaries are foolish and create the is the first=20
step to nationalism and creation of the =91other.=92 we are a nation =
that=20
thrives on islandism . . . . psychotherapy induces islandism. there is=20=

a blue jean company that produces 45 different types of blue jeans, so=20=

we can become one of 45 special islands . . . how many types of blue=20
jeans do we need?  it becomes nothing but a celebration of =93the=20
national assembly line production quotas for the year. look at me I am=20=

the newest of the new in my 1 of 45=94
         what ends up happening with all these =93x, y and z=94 books,  =
is they=20

recognizable forms are those events that take place in progress.=20
recognizable is something repeatable enough to be seen as a noun and=20
can be situated in a category.  the problem is once one zeros in on a=20

outside ourselves the more we can connect with others. =93truth=3Dmaybe.=94=

                all this brings back the question of how does one write =
a narrative=20
of resistance of the inarticulate, in a language that situates? lean=20
towards deviation, migration, position shifting, slipping in and out of=20=

focus, shifting, (that kind you do when your bored and sitting on your=20=

seat to long).  try to find alliances that go in the same direction by=20=

a different track, corollaries that  get lost in their own direction,=20
which challenge the =93find myself=94 narrative. so why do this? this is =
a =20
tool for disruption, activism, acts of personal and public empowerment.=20=

give back to the community, with glorious havoc and come up with new=20
possibilities. as =93p.=94 stated, =93remember - all prescribed =

from nowhere.=94

at its utmost durational posture.
a bed is a personal outcry

from En-gedi even to En-eglaim.

I used to lie in bed from ear to ear,
but now I lie in bed from head to toe.

HEADBOARDWARD

always point to True North.

BED PROVENCE

beds break the bank and the sun
shines darkly over the linen
she writes it out when she's out of her head - in
               my Provence, my bed.

THE BEDS

do you remember how this all started -
with the tables turning like beds?

 Dear Mairead,
          Thanks for your hospitable reply. That's what I'd like to do, =
meet
poets. I'm supposed to be at a conference at Harvard from the 15-20th
(although it decamps to Portland, Maine for the 18-20th, and I have to =
go
too because my paper's on the 19th.) This is the International History =
of
Cartography conference. I am not a cartographer so I will need to seek
relief now and then, and my evenings are free. I don't know whether =
this
meshes in any way with other meetings up with but if it does I'd be =
most
pleased.
           Cheers

Dear Wystan,
One thing a poet can do is meet other poets.  I'm already hoping to =
meet
Trevor Joyce and Ann Fisher-Wirth in Boston or Providence in June.  =
Would
you like to meet too?  I live in Providence, which is well worth a =
visit.
It's an hour by bus or train from Boston.  I could take you to the =
terrific
John Hay collection of 20th century poetry at Brown University.  =
Another
great thing to do, if you can, is go to Provincetown: that's 2-3 hrs by
Bonanza Bus from Boston.  The great poet Alan Dugan lives nearby in =
Truro
and there is usually some action around the Fine Arts Work Center.  But =
the
Boston dudes will kill me for touting Providence and Provincetown (I'm =
glad
there aren't any more towns around here beginning with "Prov," like
"Provisionaltown" or "Probablytown"..)as Boston itself is bursting with
poets and poetry and bookstores and stuff.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

> One would be hard pushed - for example - to find a
feminist presence in the work. <



I feel, in a way, as though ---no attitude intended
here (I love you all!)--- you and/or Patrick are
eating your Barney on a skewer or with escargot forks,
with a lobster bib, some sort of rigorously civilized
implement, whereas the Barney that I'm attached to
pumps goop straight back through my bellybutton.  I
might use my mouth, too, like you, except he's
shuffled it away in some sort of cornucopia of Klein
~part objects.~

That is, there's some sort of cortical armature that
keeps characterizing your critique of him, a sort of
one-size-fits-all critique heavily dependent on
codified theoretical touchstones that can, tomorrow,
be re-deployed against--- whomever, against Hugo Boss,
against Lilly Pulitzer floral pattern summerwear.
Meanwhile, Barney keeps re-rooting me down to a
virtually ~pre-natal~ iconography that simply bursts
through all those secondary defenses.

It may be because I "knew him when",--- that is,
before his dealer, Barbara Gladstone, managed the
amazing feat of bringing such scads of money to the
production of his films.  (His career and her role in
it seems comparable to that of Pollock and Peggy
Guggenheim: it's a mistake to forget about the early,
Jungian totemic Pollock in the wash of imperialist
murals that brought in the art mobs.)

The ceiling of the gallery was marked with distracting
but inconclusive sort of ~hook~ apparatuses.  Take the
video that was shown there in the Gladstone gallery,
meanwhile, while the aforementioned Vaseline
benchpress equipment froze in the basement: the young
Barney, buck naked except for a kind of hood-helmet of
some sort and various mountainclimer-like straps
fitted around, at armpit, at knee, slowly, very slowly
working his way upside-down across that same ceiling
Spiderman-like hooking and un-hooking and re-hooking
supporting cables into the handholds on the ceiling.

This isn't the nudity of fashion ads.  The composite
inverted ~crawling~ instinct and strangely
prosthetized nakedness harkened, rather, to some sort
of infantile exhibitionist urge, maybe, at best,
---the way junior plays on the rug, only topsy-turvy.



The point that I tried to make by bringing Barney into
my Fall 2001 Standard Schaefer review
(http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2001fall/schaefer.shtml),
an observation which I think is true, is that what
Barney offers, importantly, is a lushly erotic but
~non-phallic~ male:

"The performance artist and sometimes film-maker
Matthew Barney closes one of his
Cremaster films with a strange shot: some weird,
bumpy, infinity sign flesh protuberance fills the
entire screen, squeezed through an opening. One
realizes: balls. 'The End' and closing credits will
come down over or after a panoramic close-up of
anonymous testicles. In his Cremaster opera film, a
naked satyr has a Barbie's boyfriend Ken-smooth crotch
but unmistakable, makeup-powdered scrotum, that tied
to long ribbons at the ends of which are tied doves
roosting on his shoulders. At his pantomime signal,
the doves break into flight, pulling the ribbons in
their wake. . . . disturbing, scrotal masculinity."


Eros like his might seem to be foreclosed by
castration, ---except that I think the neo-infantile
sexuality he celebrates shows strong evidence of being
pre-genital.  There's an overall lack of
differentiation which I believe is distorted by
reimposing binarisms such as "feminist" or other party
politics power.

In the Chrysler Cremaster, the audience was shown
Barney's rectum, (yay!) down at the bottom of his
surgical gown as he lay stretched in the ~Marathon
Man~ dentist's chair  (Latent: Nice butt!), his legs
up in more of a gynocological exam position.  But the
~insertion~ was happening at the wrong end, as the
compacted shrapnel of a smooshed automobile is wedged
into the gaping maw of Barney's wounded mouth, knocked
toothless by his earlier champing on a horse's bit,---
and, for every force there is an equal and opposite
force, out of his pretty anus comes--- more
pearlescent goop, not his trademark tapioca this time,
but a strange nacreous glisten that then gradually
coalesces into--- ~a scrabble of teeth~ forced down
his intestinal tract.

Where status quo masculinity (or feminism or any
ideology, per se) of ~any~ dominant or identity
politics stripe figures into so completely mixed-up a
fusion of organs and drives is beyond me.  I left
those neat categories in the lobby.  They're bubblegum
stuck on the bottom of the chairs.

Beckett used to claim that he still retained conscious
memory of the pre-natal stage, ---and that it was very
depressing.   :0   That seems to be where Barney
resides, except in a more vividly technicolor version
of it, ---his continual, slug-like crawls through
tight, tapioca-splattered tunnels as revisited passage
through birth canal--- And I don't know how
successfully or appropriately critical clichés latch
onto such a polymorphous artistry.

If I went to the Gary Gilmore Cremaster with a friend
(I can't recall), my friend ---or ~somebody~---
afterwards said to me, Did you see his ~dick~ when he
was sitting in the car?

I didn't.

Not without good reason, though, apparently, as my
friend told me the glimpse of Gilmore's weenie that we
catch was a little mistake about two inches long (!).
My friend thought maybe Barney meant this was the
"deep" shame reason Gilmore was driven to his crimes,
---but I rather tend to see it as the contestation of
all the assumptions about power that these critiques
are layering over this art.

Foot fetishism of a robust "Kiss my boot!" ~Miss
Julie~ (Strindberg/Rorem/Kenward Elmslie) variety
would be ~salutary.~  Instead, besides the continual
Rockettes kicklines, in the most recent Cremaster what
we get is an ~amputee from the knees down~ balancing
on teetering glass Cinderella legs! . . . Which might
only be misleading, though, as that pushed Barney's
career-long foot motif over the top into a pristine
horror that could just re-invoke expectable
categorizations (somehow).  The feet and boot that
~really~ has to be opposed to ~Miss Julie,~ I think,
is that strange woman locked away in that tiny
triangle-shaped room at the top of the Chrysler
Building, where the kittycat goes running out the cat
door to avoid all the ~potatoes.~   Like other
Barney-designed footwear (this is, to be sure, no
Manolo Blahnik), this boot doubles as a machine: she
laboriously works at connecting an odd wedge-shaped
device to the sole of her boot, which she then
proceeds ~to cut potatoes with!~ into Masonically
arcane polygon cookie cutter shapes.  (The maligned
feminist's ~potato-chopping boot??!~)


To get back to ~what actually happens~ in Barney's
work is a totally different art experience than
misrepresenting it by only sketching it in from a
distance and mainly via critical caricatures that
don't address the core Freud he's escaped Museum Mile
into.

IMHO.

The LEIU website (Removed on 30 May 2003)

Cached version of The LEIU website:
http://seattle.indymedia.org/local/webcast/uploads/leiu_2003_training_seminar_seattle2.htm



What is the LEIU?

The LEIU is a loosely-associated group of law enforcement
and intelligence officers, whose private network of
affiliations allows information to be shared between
agencies. It was created in 1956 by the California
Department of Justice. It first included 26 law
enforcement agencies from seven western states but now
includes more than 250 agencies from the US, Canada,
Australia, South Africa, Mexico, and Britain. What is the
purpose of the LEIU?

"The [official] purpose of this organization, which is a
voluntary confederation of police agencies, is to exchange
information on organized crime and certain criminals." (1)
The unofficial purpose was to establish a national
criminal intelligence network independent of the FBI,
whose agents frequently refused to share information with
local law enforcement officers. (2)

The original format of LEIU information was hundreds of 5
x 8" cards. Each card listed, among other data, a
subject's name, alias, occupation, family members,
vehicles, associates, arrests, and physical traits. A
subject may be a person suspected of committing a crime; a
person suspected of aiding those involved in a crime; or a
person associated with a principal subject. Associates
might include family members, business associates, or
attorneys of the principal subject. (3) This data has
since been computerized, using federal funds. (4)

Why should I be concerned?

* The information is frequently wrong. The federal General
Accounting Office found that only a small percent of the
information on the LEIU cards could be completely
documented. Auditors expressed concern that "the grantee
has not yet effected either its promised verification of
index information or its promised elimination of outdated
and inaccurate data." (4)

* They don't just monitor organized crime. Topics at the
1962 training meeting in San Francisco included "police
intelligence units' role in securing information
concerning protest groups, demonstrations, and mob
violence" (FBI summary). Representatives from the INS, the
US Department of Labor, the Pacific Gas and Electric
Company, and several military investigative units were
present. (2)

* A 1974 suit filed against the Chicago Police Department
by the Alliance to End Repression revealed that LEIU files
were kept "on a University of Washington professor; a
teacher of the Republican of New Africa, a southern black
separate movement; a member of the Black Panther party; a
member of the Communist Party; and members of the American
Indian Movement." (5)

* A 1979 investigation by the Detroit Board of Police
Commissioners found that many LEIU subject cards had
information on people "not apparently related to criminal
activities." (2) "Among the subjects catalogued in LEIU
files have been minority, labor and community organizers,
many with no criminal records." (6)

* In 1991, investigative author Frank Donner's book,
Protectors of Privilege: Red Squads and Police Repression
in Urban America, documented political repression
practiced by urban police. Donner described the LEIU as a
private organization which served as a conduit for
information and technology and may also have helped local
departments evade restrictions on their intelligence
gathering. (7)

* A May 10, 1993 San Francisco Chronicle article revealed
how local police secretly use the LEIU to preserve
intelligence files that are supposed to be destroyed. (8)

Isn't that illegal?

Yes. There are local (Seattle Ordinance 108333), state,
and federal laws that restrict when and how law
enforcement officials can gather and disseminate
intelligence on political activists, organizers, and
protesters. However, the LEIU is seen as a private
organization, even though member agencies use tax dollars
to pay LEIU dues and fees. Therefore, the LEIU is not
subject to governmental oversight or the Freedom of
Information Act.

The ACLU Foundation of Northern California sued the
California Department of Justice in 1982. Under the
California Public Records Act, modeled after the Freedom
of Information Act, the ACLU sued to gain access to the
DOJ?s LEIU index cards. The trial court found in favor of
the ACLU. But the California Supreme Court found that the
burden of separating non-exempt information from exempt
information before handing the cards over to the ACLU was
too great, and ruled in favor of the State (3).

Is the Seattle Police Department (SPD) involved with the
LEIU?

Yes. Seattle Municipal Code Chapter 14.12 sets out
regulations outlining the circumstances under which the
SPD can gather and disseminate information on individuals
and groups. (SMC 14.12.010 Statement of purpose) (9)
Subsection 14.12.020 states, "No person shall become the
subject of the collection of information on account of a
lawful exercise of a constitutional right or civil
liberty; no information shall be collected upon a person
who is active in politics or community affairs, unless
under the same or similar circumstances the information
would be collected upon another person who did not
participate actively in politics or community affairs."
(Subsection A)

The ordinance also provides for "in-place audit of
Department files and records at unscheduled intervals not
to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days since the last
audit." (SMC 14.12.330) Unfortunately, this audit does not
include the LEIU files received by the SPD. (Section
14.12.320) The LEIU files are audited by the Chief of the
SPD and are maintained separately from other SPD files
(subsection C3).

The Chief submits a report to the City, which includes a
description of the documents audited, (without revealing
their contents), the number of documents audited, and the
number of documents received from LEIU. It also includes a
current set of bylaws for LEIU. (Subsection D) The most
recent report, for the audit completed July 25, 2002,
states that the SPD has 10,977 LEIU subject entries, which
are those dealing with the identification of criminal
subjects and associates (Clerk File No. 305363). The
Seattle City Council is aware of the interaction between
the SPD and LEIU because they approve the SPD Chief?s
report each year. This has been happening since at least
1983. (10)

This is interesting, the same I think as the old CuSeeMe, which I used
quite a lot - the same sort of thing would occur; you could also log in to
any of the channels without a webcam/microphone. The sound was bad, but
the image was terrific. A lot of the usage was sexual of course -

Absolutely. I've been trying to figure out why I like 'ancient' poetry so
much - for example, I've been reading William Dunbar with a delight I
rarely feel with contemporary work.

Absolutely. I think of this as world-creation, or better, worlds-creating.
I think the work of Michel Dufrenne (I may have the wrong spelling here)
on the phenomenology of literature is quite useful.

This holds for a while, but then things settle down; Cybermind for example
is quite stable, and has been for years now. It's not a question of me and
my cronies, but users who have found a communality, Lessig's commons,
among each other.

I read your essay a while ago; I've also read McLuhan. It's not that much
of an issue with me. I noticed something a while ago, which is relevant I
think - that, early on, say 6-7 years ago, communities were determined in
part by the software - MOO/MUD/various webchats, etc. etc. - but then
there was a change - communities would actually move/shift from one site
to another - the community, in other words, was becoming more autonomous
in terms of media/software domain. This is oddly in line with the Smart
Mobs book of course -

Oh, I totally agree here -

Agree here as well - your reasoning is also why I tend to like
Baudrillard, even though he's oddly transparent -

Hey Wystan (and list),

David Kirschenbaum from Boog City here.

Yeah, yeah, I know we're in NY, but here's my quick "how I got turned onto
the Boston scene" story, which should be of help to you.

I went up in 1998 for the first Boston Alternative Poetry Festival, organized
by a then-unknown Aaron Kiely (this is the festival that has become the
Boston Poetry Marathon run by Donna DeLapierre, Joseph Lease, and, this year,
Joanna Fuhrman).

I had met Dan Bouchard, then the editor of Mass. Ave, now the co-editor of
Pressed Wafer, and solo ed. of the Poker, two years earlier, on the
recommendation of Pavement Saw editor David Baratier. I had an extra ticket for the 1996
Red Sox Patriots' Day game and Baratier suggested calling Dan up, and I did and
we had a swell time though the Sox were destroyed.

At the 1998 festival I met many Boston-area poets who have played some sort
of a role in my life over the past five years, be it as good friend and amazing
poet or simply sounding board or signpost.

If I was giving my, here's the people you must be in contact if you want to
say you've done the Boston poetry thing, and, again, bear in mind that it's not
my city, so my knowledge is 1) not as deep and 2) not as informed and 3)
well, not as biased into all the pettiness that is always a part, however small or
large, of any big city's poetry scene, my own included, here's who they'd be,
in no particular order, and a quick why:

--the three Pressed Wafer editors, Dan Bouchard, Bill Corbett, and Joe
Torra--Forget that these three run one of the best small presses in the country,
they're also three great writers and people. Dan is the one to whom you'll
probably be able to get the easiest access to, as Bill and Joe lay low.

--Michael Franco--He may be the warmest person I know, opening his home back
in the day to a good dozen poets to flop here and there in rooms in his
under-remodeling three-story home, cooking a wonderful spaghetti dinner on saturday
nights of the festival for everyone, and opening up his home to party in. That
said, he's also a letterpress wonder, amazing designer, and damn fine poet,
too. And his wife Isabella rocks. He has, to this outsider, been laying low for
the last three years or so since his wife gave birth to their little boy,
Thomas. If somehow he'd find the time to grab a cup of coffee with you or, pray
tell, show you some of the Duncan work he's done, you'd leave as a
card-carrying member of the church of michael franco.

--Sean Cole--I'm biased here, cause Sean is a dear friend, I published his
first chap,  he does a postcard project for my press each December, and when i
come to boston it's his and his lady Mary Ellen's home that I crash at. Now,
and I don't know how I can say this without offending every other poet living or
dead, but if I was told I could only publish one poet from now until the day
I died, that poet would be Sean Cole. And, as a community member, he is the
one who arranges for these various festivals to get recorded properly--he works
at the local NPR station, so he has equipment access. He also hooks up the
poetry community through the station he works at, helping features get on the
radio about the upcoming festivals and the like.

--Jim Behrle--I can't say enough about Jim Behrle. As much as I like Sean's
work is how much I admire the work Jim does as organizer/editor/gadfly/poet. He
is the one you call when you want something done, done yesterday, and done
well, be it the various series he has run/runs, the web site
canwehaveourballback.com, the recent 60 poets festival at MIT, or, simply, his blog, where even
as we are learning way too much about him we want to learn more. He also don't
take no guff, has moxie by the gallon in his veins, and speaks his mind, a
rarity in this enclosed poetry world of ours where everyone is worried how others
will view them.

--Luisa Solano--She owns the Grolier Poetry Bookshop, THE place, as a poet,
you can live in for a day as you thumb through every title and consistently go
"WOW!" Everyone I've ever dealt with in Boston has something bad to say about
her, everyone. Me, as a visiting poet who's been to Boston maybe a half-dozen
times, even has a negative story about my interaction with her. That said, if
you catch her on a good day, when the store's empty, and her dog's behaving
well, she'll quite often open up with stories about poets and publications that
most people would never hear elsewhere. And, there is no way, no matter how
sad she makes you feel, if she does, that you won't walk out of there spending
some $ on some title you know you'll never find elsewhere. She's also beyond
good about taking stuff on consignment.

--Maria Damon-Now the swonderful Ms. Damon is, I think, only a summer
visitor, perhaps a summer liver, since she's out in Minnesota during the school year,
but, somehow, every festival I ever attend in Boston has her listed as
reading. Yeah, she's a great poet, but she's big on community-building and has been
around the block doing it.

--Jack Powers-The Boston people will know this more than me, hell, I'm not
even sure if he's still alive,  but he ran/runs a great open mic at a local rock
club, publishes a mag whose name escapes me right now (BOSTON, HELP), and is
a bit of a character. Luisa at the Grolier actually hooked me up with his info.

--Aaron Kiely-You can take the boy out of Boston, but you can't take the
Boston out of the boy. Aaron's still a frequent visitor to the city, be it to
perform--as he will this weekend at the Boston Poetry Marathon--or see his many
friends and family. He's a dear friend, someone who I've frequently published
and had perform, both his poetry and the music of his and Sean's band, Ruth
Gordon (now an Aaron solo project). That said, getting an audience with Kiely may
be tougher than getting one with the Pope. But, if you get one, your head may
delightfully explode.

Doing this list I'm realizing one main thing, how fucking white-male centric
it is. Since it's not my city, I'm simply writing of who I know and dig and
have been exposed to, and, unfortunately, I haven't been turned on to many women
poets who are still in Boston. All of the ones I dig--Ange Mlinko, Prageeta
Sharma, and Tracy Blackmer among them--live down my way in NYC.

And as for people of color, I just haven't been real exposed to it through
this scene, much the same as in NY where, for all the integration we may have,
the scene that revolves around the Poetry Project is, essentially, a white
boy's club, but without the No Coloreds Allowed sign on the door. Girls are
allowed to play, it seems, but are never given the leadership positions, a situation
that has recently repeated itself, however much my love for Anselm Berrigan
knows no bounds.

Alrighty Wystan, hope this helps man, and if you wanna hook up with any of
these folk, backchannel me, and i'll do my best to make it happen.

as ever,
David

Hello All,

This Friday, June 6th @ 7:30 PM, Chop Suey Books in Richmond Virginia
will host a reading and book release party for Cheryl Pallant's newest
book, Into Stillness, published by Station Hill Press.

Into Stillness, written in prose-like paragraphs, is a meditation on
the sacredness of the body in the shadow of atrocity. Carole Maso
describes it as "a death-defying act of language and imagination. An
audacious, fluid living thing."

hi everyone, i'm reading this graham robb bio of rimbaud --i'm
hooked. it's wonderfully engaging. i started browsing it just for the
info on his travel writing in his later years, but of course went
further and further back into the wealth of detail about verlaine,
london, germany, even java and possibly australia.  the truth is
stranger than fiction etc (what an original insight...)  anyway
highly recommended for entertaining summer reading.

With crime, high dropout and teenage pregnancy rates in these communities escalating, The Woodson Project intervenes and inspires at risk students with after-school programs that give them academic support in literature and art. With the education crisis continuing in the form of budget cuts, governmental neglect and inept reorganization, programs like the Woodson Project must be supported. In helping their communities, they are helping us. Let's acknowledge them.

And then waves of blackbirds rise from the bed. You,
who love so much to be martyred: red yarns fill you
with an accidental narrative, one in which you get out
of bed, force a face on your thoughts, saw through
jules of calendar-warped spaghetti; all the while
wanting you to watch me, watch my cry, shimmer like
smoke. By that time she was noticing the color of the
wind. It smears across my dead stepfather's mouth as
he never kisses me goodnight; mother's not allowed to
either, your maggot tongue beating in the rain like an
opened road kill, wet dog strewn across wet squirrel
across wet rabbit, bunny rabbit: the pavement drools a
honey sulphur rush. Will I blush to think of you,
years after the networks unravel, no hard critic to
unknot the nothing chains, no star-spattered art in
your hands anymore,  but grasping the root, saplings
bent to this shade of wind? What hue will water talk?

        Teal is one likely candidate, a diluting of black.

        No-one's paying attention now, so you can loosen your
cells in long trails through the lake. I fell down
trying to follow you, slim Virginian with a
belt-buckle shaped like a globe; you were too right
and too natural for my footprints to bury you. A hard
critic moans into duct tape and pillows, something
dead about expression that twists into all the shapes
we love: especially the food, which has spoiled now
because I kissed it with lips refuting their own
composition. Some say her plane never left that
holding pattern over snowy Cleveland. Even so, the
balance of cryptic green on layers serrated by her
mouth enveloping these tinny deaths online keeps
circling over my inert distributions;  restless, I
comb through the hex and octal strands, prefixing
curls with a truth-table half submerged in a barbarity
of bright ideas: turn the light on, dear, turn the
light on me so you can see me crawl over the floor,
dead stepfather in straight-jacket mouth, deader
father watered with yarns of silver ivy! Am I not
beautiful, refusing to hold form?

        What did you dream about, under the lake where cats
equal their shadows?

        I dream of car crashes, and snakes that blur with
flippant scales.

        Hold me! You could cave in and let me enter you: let
me fill you up:  give me a face!

> One would be hard pushed - for example - to find a
feminist presence in the work. <

Jeffrey, you indeed get a lot of wonderful gooey, bummy mileage out of my
quote of saying what's "not" in Barney's work . Which is great to draw
attention to - as was your yesterday post attention to Barney's
mytho-doodling away in his classroom appearance, and, in your view, if I am
paraphrasing you accurately, Barney's narcissistic, hermetic side -  in I
guess what you are here visually dwellng on and suggesting is
pre-differentiated sexual, yet non or pre-erotic world.

I think what I am experiencing in the work (again I am just recently
immersed in the Cremaster film series) is a visual space that is rendered in
both erotic and counter-erotic terms. This is obviously a highly sensual
eye, totally embraced/consummed by whatever its content - but as film the
experience of the ecstatic goes from luminous to dark dark.

The mere fact that the films take Barney and his pre and post natal
equipment and consciousness into the national realm (football fields,
Chrysler building, Gilmore, etc. etc.) necessarily call the work into larger
political and other kinds of critique.  You have to admit he's banging on
and swinging with some pretty large demons here.

And I suspect - if I can speculate -  that this move will always remain at
odds with your fondness for the  pre-Barbara Gladstone cinematic/book etc.
launch of Barney into an international spectacle. It is out of the local gym
and into the major coliseum - complete with corporate boxes.

But it's great - and I don't mean to say this with any condescension - to
have your 'nativist' memories of Barney and to keep those at play in the
fore. The naked eye bouncing off the lens.

Dear friends,

On June 5, Thursday, the House will vote on a bill oddly called the "Family
Time Flexibility Act."  Under the bill, employers will no longer be
obligated to pay their employees overtime for working over 40 hours a week.
Instead employers can force comp time on the employee.  For those of us
living on hourly pay, forced time off hurts us greatly.


CALL YOUR REPRESENTATIVES AND TELL THEM TO STOP HR 1119
(look up your representatives' phone numbers:
http://www.visi.com/juan/congress/)

SPREAD THE WORD IMMEDIATELY!!!

Interesting how there is almost zero media coverage on this hot topic.

This week the government cleared the way for media monopolies.  Now they're
about to remove employers' obligations to pay overtime, thus destroying the
40 hour workweek.  For those of us who live on hourly wages, this is
DEVASTATING.

Comp Time legislation, now called the "Family Time Flexibility Act" (H.R.
1119), would replace overtime pay with time off from work. It would allow
employers to work employees more than 40 hours per week without paying them
overtime pay, for up to 160 hours a year. Instead, employers would "pay"
workers with a promise of time off in the future, when the employer -- not
the worker -- deems it convenient.]


Talking points to oppose H.R. 1119:
(from the Coalition of Labor Union Women website)

The 40-hour workweek, enacted in the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938,
remains the bedrock family-friendly statute. This is the law that "brought
us the weekend."

The only mechanism by which the 40-hour workweek is "enforced" is its
requirement that employers pay time-and-a-half premium for all hours in
excess of 40 in a workweek. In other words, the law establishes a monetary
disincentive for employers to work their employees more than 40 hours a
week.

Comp Time legislation (currently H.R. 1119 in the House of Representatives)
removes this monetary disincentive by allowing employers to compensate
employees who work overtime with a promise of time off in the future instead
of time-and-a-half pay.
With the disincentive removed, the number of hours worked by American
workers (already the highest among industrialized nations) will inevitably
increase. The 40-hour workweek will erode.

It is a simple fact that workers who are compensated in time off will take
home less money than workers who get premium pay. For millions of workers,
time-and-a-half overtime pay is essential to meet their basic needs like
housing, food and health care costs.
The Comp Time legislation is not about giving work time flexibility to
workers, it's about cutting costs for employers. The current Fair Labor
Standards Act already allows an employer to permit workers to adjust their
work schedules to take care of personal matters, such as attending a child's
school activities.

H.R. 1119, Family Time Flexibility Act, erodes the 40-hour workweek; it
means less pay for workers, and it is not needed for work time flexibility.

AScribe Newswire - June 02, 2003

BLOOMINGTON, Ind., June 2 (AScribe Newswire) -- How infants respond to
their mother's touches and smiles influences their development in a
manner much like what young birds experience when learning to sing,
according to a research project involving the Department of Psychology
at Indiana University Bloomington and the Biological Foundations of
Behavior program at Franklin and Marshall College.

An article on the research, titled "Social interaction shapes
babbling: Testing parallels between birdsong and speech," will be
published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences. The Web site for the journal is
http://www.pnas.org/misc/highlights.shtml. The academy's Web site is
http://www4.nationalacademies.org/nas/nashome.nsf.

"The main point of our research is how the reaction of the babies to
their mother's touches and smiles changes how they talk, and this
corresponds to what birds do when learning to sing," said Meredith
West, a professor of psychology and biology at IU. She collaborated on
the article with Andrew King, a senior scientist at IU, and Michael
Goldstein, an assistant professor of psychology at Franklin & Marshall
College in Lancaster, Pa.

"This research takes advantage of infants' sociality to understand
development as it is constructed by interactions with caregivers,"
Goldstein said, "and it shows that social learning is a crucial part
of vocal development."

Goldstein is the principal author of the article, which he researched
as part of his IU doctorate that was supervised by West. King directed
the research on birds that was a model for Goldstein's work.

"This is the first time for research showing that babies change how
they vocalize in response to social responses -- not sounds, but
sights -- by using more mature sounds," West said. "This shows that
parent behavior plays a role very early in the process of babies
learning to talk, a role that goes beyond simply talking to the
infant."

West studies behavior development in animals and humans. She is
particularly interested in the development of communication and social
behavior in the young.

She said the research shows that babies, and birds, pay attention to
the social consequences of sound-making and change their behavior
accordingly. So their sounds have a function beyond simply making
noise.

"By manipulating how mothers behave," West explained, "we demonstrated
that babies can change how they vocalize without copying or imitating
their mother's behavior. The mothers did not change how they talked
but whether they touched or smiled at the baby. That changed the
content of the infant's sounds, as they were more mature or
word-like."

Goldstein added, "This project shows that maternal behavior and infant
sensory capacities interact to generate the development of more
advanced infant behavior. It shows that social learning is a crucial
part of vocal development."

The researchers studied 30 infants with an average age of 8 months and
monitored their interaction with their mothers over two 30-minute play
sessions. This included sessions when the mothers were directed to act
in specific ways while responding to the infants, and audio and visual
testing equipment monitored the results. An analysis of these results
formed the basis of the findings.

"This data provides strong support for a parallel in function between
vocal precursors of songbirds and infants. Because imitation is
usually considered the mechanism for vocal learning in both
situations, the findings introduce social shaping as a general process
underlying the development of speech and song," the researchers wrote
in the abstract of the journal article.

Funding for the research came from the National Institute of Mental
Health, the National Science Foundation and the IU Center for the
Integrative Study of Animal Behavior.

> One would be hard pushed - for example - to find a
feminist presence in the work. <



I feel, in a way, as though ---no attitude intended
here (I love you all!)--- you and/or Patrick are
eating your Barney on a skewer or with escargot forks,
with a lobster bib, some sort of rigorously civilized
implement, whereas the Barney that I'm attached to
pumps goop straight back through my bellybutton.  I
might use my mouth, too, like you, except he's
shuffled it away in some sort of cornucopia of Klein
~part objects.~

That is, there's some sort of cortical armature that
keeps characterizing your critique of him, a sort of
one-size-fits-all critique heavily dependent on
codified theoretical touchstones that can, tomorrow,
be re-deployed against--- whomever, against Hugo Boss,
against Lilly Pulitzer floral pattern summerwear.
Meanwhile, Barney keeps re-rooting me down to a
virtually ~pre-natal~ iconography that simply bursts
through all those secondary defenses.

It may be because I "knew him when",--- that is,
before his dealer, Barbara Gladstone, managed the
amazing feat of bringing such scads of money to the
production of his films.  (His career and her role in
it seems comparable to that of Pollock and Peggy
Guggenheim: it's a mistake to forget about the early,
Jungian totemic Pollock in the wash of imperialist
murals that brought in the art mobs.)

The ceiling of the gallery was marked with distracting
but inconclusive sort of ~hook~ apparatuses.  Take the
video that was shown there in the Gladstone gallery,
meanwhile, while the aforementioned Vaseline
benchpress equipment froze in the basement: the young
Barney, buck naked except for a kind of hood-helmet of
some sort and various mountainclimer-like straps
fitted around, at armpit, at knee, slowly, very slowly
working his way upside-down across that same ceiling
Spiderman-like hooking and un-hooking and re-hooking
supporting cables into the handholds on the ceiling.

This isn't the nudity of fashion ads.  The composite
inverted ~crawling~ instinct and strangely
prosthetized nakedness harkened, rather, to some sort
of infantile exhibitionist urge, maybe, at best,
---the way junior plays on the rug, only topsy-turvy.



The point that I tried to make by bringing Barney into
my Fall 2001 Standard Schaefer review
(http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2001fall/schaefer.shtml),
an observation which I think is true, is that what
Barney offers, importantly, is a lushly erotic but
~non-phallic~ male:

"The performance artist and sometimes film-maker
Matthew Barney closes one of his
Cremaster films with a strange shot: some weird,
bumpy, infinity sign flesh protuberance fills the
entire screen, squeezed through an opening. One
realizes: balls. 'The End' and closing credits will
come down over or after a panoramic close-up of
anonymous testicles. In his Cremaster opera film, a
naked satyr has a Barbie's boyfriend Ken-smooth crotch
but unmistakable, makeup-powdered scrotum, that tied
to long ribbons at the ends of which are tied doves
roosting on his shoulders. At his pantomime signal,
the doves break into flight, pulling the ribbons in
their wake. . . . disturbing, scrotal masculinity."


Eros like his might seem to be foreclosed by
castration, ---except that I think the neo-infantile
sexuality he celebrates shows strong evidence of being
pre-genital.  There's an overall lack of
differentiation which I believe is distorted by
reimposing binarisms such as "feminist" or other party
politics power.

In the Chrysler Cremaster, the audience was shown
Barney's rectum, (yay!) down at the bottom of his
surgical gown as he lay stretched in the ~Marathon
Man~ dentist's chair  (Latent: Nice butt!), his legs
up in more of a gynocological exam position.  But the
~insertion~ was happening at the wrong end, as the
compacted shrapnel of a smooshed automobile is wedged
into the gaping maw of Barney's wounded mouth, knocked
toothless by his earlier champing on a horse's bit,---
and, for every force there is an equal and opposite
force, out of his pretty anus comes--- more
pearlescent goop, not his trademark tapioca this time,
but a strange nacreous glisten that then gradually
coalesces into--- ~a scrabble of teeth~ forced down
his intestinal tract.

Where status quo masculinity (or feminism or any
ideology, per se) of ~any~ dominant or identity
politics stripe figures into so completely mixed-up a
fusion of organs and drives is beyond me.  I left
those neat categories in the lobby.  They're bubblegum
stuck on the bottom of the chairs.

Beckett used to claim that he still retained conscious
memory of the pre-natal stage, ---and that it was very
depressing.   :0   That seems to be where Barney
resides, except in a more vividly technicolor version
of it, ---his continual, slug-like crawls through
tight, tapioca-splattered tunnels as revisited passage
through birth canal--- And I don't know how
successfully or appropriately critical clichés latch
onto such a polymorphous artistry.

If I went to the Gary Gilmore Cremaster with a friend
(I can't recall), my friend ---or ~somebody~---
afterwards said to me, Did you see his ~dick~ when he
was sitting in the car?

I didn't.

Not without good reason, though, apparently, as my
friend told me the glimpse of Gilmore's weenie that we
catch was a little mistake about two inches long (!).
My friend thought maybe Barney meant this was the
"deep" shame reason Gilmore was driven to his crimes,
---but I rather tend to see it as the contestation of
all the assumptions about power that these critiques
are layering over this art.

Foot fetishism of a robust "Kiss my boot!" ~Miss
Julie~ (Strindberg/Rorem/Kenward Elmslie) variety
would be ~salutary.~  Instead, besides the continual
Rockettes kicklines, in the most recent Cremaster what
we get is an ~amputee from the knees down~ balancing
on teetering glass Cinderella legs! . . . Which might
only be misleading, though, as that pushed Barney's
career-long foot motif over the top into a pristine
horror that could just re-invoke expectable
categorizations (somehow).  The feet and boot that
~really~ has to be opposed to ~Miss Julie,~ I think,
is that strange woman locked away in that tiny
triangle-shaped room at the top of the Chrysler
Building, where the kittycat goes running out the cat
door to avoid all the ~potatoes.~   Like other
Barney-designed footwear (this is, to be sure, no
Manolo Blahnik), this boot doubles as a machine: she
laboriously works at connecting an odd wedge-shaped
device to the sole of her boot, which she then
proceeds ~to cut potatoes with!~ into Masonically
arcane polygon cookie cutter shapes.  (The maligned
feminist's ~potato-chopping boot??!~)


To get back to ~what actually happens~ in Barney's
work is a totally different art experience than
misrepresenting it by only sketching it in from a
distance and mainly via critical caricatures that
don't address the core Freud he's escaped Museum Mile
into.

IMHO.

Thanks for posting this, Tom.  Intriguing stuff, and I look forward to
reading the referenced article to get more details.  Doubly interesting to
me because 1) we have a new-ish baby at home, and 2) I've long had a
lingering ardor for the idea of the jungle girl who can speak/sing
bird-language/song in Hudson's Green Mansions.  Notable, tho, that the
study is concerned only with mothers--no mention of
fathers.

I had the same response as Steve, here - I mean it is 2003 - and depending
on class and circumstance, among co-parenting families, fathers combine to
create a whole other contribution of gestural  intimacies with new babies,
let alone those among "the funded", which bring nannies of all different
ethnic, age and national makes into majority contact with the new kid.  I
think you would really have to create a wider frame to also include same
gender parents, etc.

But with Bush as President - or whatever foundation politics - there might
have been in built-in bias to the funding?

Keep us posted, Steve, on your observations.  I'm a grandfather who lived
with my granddaughter for a year and I still plays a role.  I think there
are biological and cultural factors in the mother/child monopoly.  They
probably play more of a role in publication: mother/child poems are a
natural but I have yet to see any by fathers?

Now that sounds like a list challenge *par excellence*.  Surely, there
have to be some good father/child poems out there?!

Let's see,  Williams has some great ones about babies, and about being a
grandfather (and surely some about being a parent?).  And I think Robert
Hass might have a couple.  Hmmm, I'll have to ruminate on this, or maybe
go write a poem...

Ted was a great admirer of Langston Hughes & his work & often talked about
him.

On the occasion of Hughes' birthday in 2000, Ted did a reading at UC
Berkeley. The audio is here: http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/VideoTest/joans.ram
Ishmael Reed introduces Ted for a little over eight minutes, then Ted
reminisces about Langston Hughes, reads a few of Hughes' poems, and a number
of his own.

Ted was indeed a surrealist, having been proclaimed one by Andre Breton. He
was a painter & collage artist as well as a poet. He edited the surrealist
journals and contributed work (poetry / prose / art) to a great number of
surrealist periodicals & books. Ted identified himself more with the
Surrealists than the Beats, and often proclaimed "Jazz is my religion and
surrealism is my point of view."

He was all of these: Surrealist - Beat - jazz poet & muscian -  artist.

A good introduction to Ted's work would be WOW, published 1999 by
Quartermoon Press. It is about 60 pages of poems which span Ted Joans'
career & includes quite a number of Surrealist poems. His selected poems,
Teducation, was published by Coffee House Press in 2001 & is excellent as
well. You can also follow the links at
http://www.emptymirrorbooks.com/joans.html to read some of his work online.
There are book reviews on his official website,
www.emptymirrorbooks.com/laurated . And, of course, the tribute to Ted at
http://www.emptymirrorbooks.com/tedjoanslives/ is still ongoing (and now
numbers 9 pages!).

Kyle:
Hope the move went pleasantly and is now complete. (Some hope!)

When you have a moment, could you possible send me a list of what
broadsides I sent youi? I've just unearthed another snall cache (the
result of unpacking a box from our move in 1997!), and will send those
(if any) that I didn't send. Like an oaf I never took a note of what I s
ent you - or if I did, IU've lost it after forgetting it.

The name of the poet or the poem shd be enough.

Thanks.

=========

And Meredith says I should send you a hunk of my autobiography for
consideration by Kiosk. I kinda doubt it's even remotely apt, but if you
agree with her, let me know - and what sorta length limits you have for
prose (I have 130,000 words to choose from).

Best,

Peter

Blue Wind Press announces
the expanded 2nd edition of

Chances Are Few by Lorenzo Thomas

Originally published in 1979, this was the first major collection of poetry
by the internationally acclaimed Panamanian-born African-American poet and
critic. Now Lorenzo Thomas' poetry will be available again to the 21st
century reader. This expanded second edition has almost 30 pages of new
poems, as well as a new introduction by the author.

Lorenzo Thomas writes in the introduction: "Writing poems involves that
desperate attempt to pass through sophistication into wisdom. So the
poet-disdaining fashion-tries on hats and costumes, modes and forms. Takes
soundings. There is always the need to find and recognize beauty. Wherever
we are. And, as Roberto McKay insists, there is the need to tell the truth."

Library Journal said of the first edition: "Sharp, urbane, caustic social
criticism by a black Panamanian poet (currently living in Texas). 'traveling
through' the derailments of our times, anticipating disaster. Thomas
addresses Middle America in the emperor's clothes, and locates a demonic
inferno in the center of the American dream..."

Erica Hunt in the "The Black Scholar" said:  "The poems in Chances are Few
are urban poems - they walk the walk and talk the talk, dense with the
murmurs, boasts, chants, grousing, borrowed speech, rhetorical brilliance,
and hyper-realism of city culture."

The Houston Chronicle said "There is a quality to Thomas' poetry that makes
one want to read it aloud and drink in the sound...short pithy lines roll
off the tongue and captivate the ear."

Chadwyck-Healey, in its database of 20th Century African American
Literature, states: "Lorenzo Thomas, born in the Republic of Panama,
migrated with his parents to New York in 1948. A native speaker of Spanish,
Thomas credits his struggle to learn English with the growth of his interest
in literature. Thomas participated in the Umbra workshop, a group of
experimental writers that became associated with the Black Arts Movement of
the 1960s, while attending Queens College, where he earned his BA (1967). He
entered the U.S. Navy in 1968, serving in Vietnam in 1971. After leaving the
Navy in 1972, Thomas became writer in residence at Texas Southern University
in 1973. In addition to teaching at the University of Houston, Thomas has
been a member of the literature advisory panel for the Texas Commission on
the Arts. His criticism of American music, art, and literature has been
published widely.
"Thomas is what is often referred to as an 'experimental' poet because of
his willingness to work in a non-narrative lyric mode. His use of
fragmentation and open form lend his poems a powerful musical intelligence,
conveying the complexity and immediacy of contemporary experience.
"Thomas has been a recipient of the Dwight Durling prize in poetry, the
Lucille Medwick Award, two Poets Foundation awards, in addition to a
fellowship with the National Endowment for the Arts."
 His most recent book is "Extraordinary Measures: Afrocentric Modernism and
20th Century American Poetry" from the University of Alabama Press.

In the spirit of summer reading recommendations (and this rimbaud one
sounds terrific), I'm attaching an amazon review I wrote for Mike
Magee's MS.  This is amazon, mind you, not the New Yorker or even the
Nation, but I hope it piques your interest if you haven't seen the book
already.  Hello June!

The Shafted Strike Back
review of:  Michael Magee MS (Sputyen Duyvil, 2003)

Remember that capsule they sent into space with examples of earth art to
show any aliens out there what it means to be human?  I wonder what
they’d think if they found this dazzling book on board.  Magee’s put the
English through a cyclotron of contemporary American voicings and come
out the other side with a souped-up language that feels big enough and
fast enough to just about cover Where We Are Now.  The title “MS” moves
in a lot of directions—manuscript, multiple sclerosis, the gender-savvy
“miz”—and the poems touch on all of these and then some, often in the
same stanza.  I especially like the way Magee takes quirks of the
language like homonyms and puns and uses them to explore a crazy quilt
of subjects most of us would never think to loop together.  Like in
“Daughters of the American Revolution,” where he moves the word “wesson”
from guns to cooking oil to black gold to blackness with the warp speed
of a master turntablist.  Or “Leave a Light On,” which rings the changes
on the meanings of “shaft” (think Isaac Hayes meets Lucky Charms).  Or
“P”—one guess where that starts—where a schoolyard rhyme gets hit with
some seriously funny theory.

    There’s a deeply American rat-a-tat to these poems that owes a lot
to hip-hop’s verbal glee (“this is a fact check/from the girl at the hat
check with a hatchet”).  But Magee draws on whole families of
vernaculars, black and otherwise, and manages to graft them onto wider
poetic traditions in a way that seems totally natural:

“Death, maybe, isn’t gluttonous, as in Donne—
it’s more like someone says to Him, “You
want the rest of this cheeseburger?” and He
  says, “I guess so.”

or:

“the belles of St. Mary knell
‘The Real Slim Shady.’”

Magee’s out for more than just nyuks;  these poems tackle some heavy
questions about mortality, history and the way gender, ethnicity and
race consciousness graffiti our personal manuscripts.  But they do it
with a phat beat that feels just right for the new millennium.  “MS”
trades fours with a good chunk of American culture and, by the time you
reach the last poem, you half-believe it just might win.  I hope this
exciting collection finds the readers it deserves.  Even on Uranus.

hi everyone, i'm reading this graham robb bio of rimbaud --i'm
hooked. it's wonderfully engaging. i started browsing it just for the
info on his travel writing in his later years, but of course went
further and further back into the wealth of detail about verlaine,
london, germany, even java and possibly australia.  the truth is
stranger than fiction etc (what an original insight...)  anyway
highly recommended for entertaining summer reading.

I think I've written a couple of dozen. Armand Schwerner wrote several that
are included in the Selected Shorter Poems. There's a lovely piece by John
Crowe Ransom, "Janet Waking." I don't think it would be hard to find a lot
more.

i am looking forward to reading robb's bio on rimbaud-  and i wanted to tell
people that jean-luc steinmetz's relatively recent bio of rimbaud is
excellent... he writes in the first-person, which gives it a real sense of
vitality lacking in many bios.

i suspect starkie's work is getting pushed further and further to the back
of the line, as newer and more honest rimbaud scholarship continues to be
done. but that is just my opinion... it has been a long time since i read
starkie's bio...can anyone tell me if and why it is still relevant?

well i read the starkie bio so many years ago i can't honestly give
an impression.  i loved reading that one too at the time but was
aware that i was reading a piece of cult lit --it was "so bad it's
good" --this seems more closely researched --a lot more info seems to
have surfaced in the intervening years --and robb deals quite
extensively with the post-writing years, which of course were the
majority of AR's life.  Hi, by the way. bests, md

News from Cuneiform:

David Pavelich's Outlining

Outlining is David Pavelich's first chapbook. After studying Lorine =
Niedecker's reflective poetics at SUNY Buffalo, he moved to Madison, =
where he is continuing his research at the University of Wisconsin. A =
broadside, Sketches for Fields (So & So Press) appeared in 2002, and =
"Six Stanzas" were recently published in Antennae. In 2003, he will =
co-curate the reading series Felix.


There are 100 copies of this chapbook printed in blue, black, purple, =
violet, red and copper inks in the month of May on a Vandercook 4. =
Copies of this title are available for $10.00 (including S&H).


Read Ron Silliman's "David Pavelich's Outlining: articulating the =
process of the poem" @ : http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/

Wednesday, May 28, 2003 =20


One of the advantages of bird watching as an activity is that the =
process organizes one's experience of any given hike, yet does so in =
such a fashion that two walks literally down the same path will be =
appreciably different. The supposedly stable elements of the walk - =
foliage, ponds, trails - now are seen primarily as a background context =
for a more variable &, to a birder, exciting element. Outlining, David =
Pavelich's new chapbook from Cuneiform Press, has some similarities to a =
bird walk in that these short texts - seven in all, with none over seven =
lines long - have in fact been stripped down literally to the level =
suggested by the title, such as:

     in exchange of profile
     unshared span, shading
     action

       in settling down


Or the following, which may very well be, at some level, "about birds":

      of crest and down
      of step, of flight, of pattern
      in nest differentiate
=20
      point - but no specific
      series - but no specific
      field

=20

In much the way that Jackson Pollock's painting might be viewed as being =
"about brush strokes" or the way Ellsworth Kelly's are about shape, =
Pavelich's poems articulate the process of the poem while giving away =
only a minimum of its "context," as Roman Jakobson characterized the =
realm referenced by any given statement. In this sense, they are direct =
descendants of the poems by Zukofsky or Creeley that literally count out =
the positions within the text:=20

     Here here
     here. Here.


Or, also from Pieces,

      Again
      and again
     now
     also.


Pavelich's pieces aren't as strict in their sense of redaction, but =
rather - as in the first piece - want the reader to hear & feel the pace =
of the language, the space of that extra wide line break between the =
unfinished tercet & that final partial line. The shift in the second =
piece - I read it as first stanza birding, second stanza poem - makes =
not only a specific point, but does so with a humor that is interested =
in testing its own gentleness. I wonder, in today's poetry, just how =
many readers will be able to hear that, but I do and am very glad to =
have found it.=20

Cuneiform Press does gorgeous work, but in very limited runs. This book =
is so beautiful that it borders on the obscene. Though I would not have =
complained at a heavier weight paper stock. There are just 100 copies. =
Pavelich I believe - I don't know the man - is somewhere in Wisconsin =
these days, a part of the country where poets have been known to go for =
decades before anybody takes much notice. I hope we don't have to wait =
nearly so long to see more of this careful, thoughtful, wise writing

I suppose this post will drive 90% of the people on this board insane
because it would appear to totally disconnect with the viewpoint
expressed.  I am a great believer in cognitive dissonance, however, so I
post it in that vein.  It was written by a lifelong pacifist and member
of the Assyrian Christian community of Iraq.  It's getting a lot press
in Lutheran circles, but I don't think has gotten to much of the
academic community.  It's a totally different viewpoint than anything
else that you hear, at least, on either side of the simple dichotomous
zero-sum game of football that America calls politics but then maybe
you've heard this before -- I have largely tuned this issue out to avoid
grinding my teeth any further:

'Mother of the Nation,' Poet and Lesbian?

June 4, 2003
By LARRY ROHTER




Nearly a half-century after the death of the poet Gabriela
Mistral, her iconic status in Chile is being re-examined.

likes especially the poetry of Carla Harryman and Ron Silliman, so he's
not averse to language poetry per se, but he asked me to keep his
response anonymous as he kind of likes his life without extra hassles or

If I may add something of a little more prosaic nature on the wonderful
post about mom and daughter, and bird language.  My boy Tommy is 2.
Teaching him to speak I was very aware of what level he could attain.
For instance, at first it was all objects.  And the clearer harder
consonants were easiest -- cat, dog (he likes to pretend to be these
animals at this point).  There was another level of abstraction from
reality having to do with colors.  This took nearly a month of going
over before he finally got it -- and now he knows about ten colors.
Words like freedom, or even abstractions like gadgetry -- they will have
to wait maybe another year or so.  So it seems to me that we are
starting with real stuff, and moving towards abstractions.  I think
anybody with kids could verify this.  But now his longest sentence is,
"I like to play basketball at Chuck E. Cheese."  This sentence really
excites him and he says it about a half-dozen times a day, and sometimes
in his sleep.  I felt gratified to see that my very postmodern friend
thought too that reality exists and that language is description in all
the major postmodern French authors.  It is, too, in my kid's language.

Wolfowitz: Iraq war was about oil

George Wright
Wednesday June 4, 2003

Oil was the main reason for military action against Iraq, a leading White
House hawk has claimed, confirming the worst fears of those opposed to the
US-led war.
The US deputy defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz - who has already undermined
Tony Blair's position over weapons of mass destruction (WMD) by describing
them as a "bureaucratic" excuse for war - has now gone further by claiming
the real motive was that Iraq is "swimming" in oil.
The latest comments were made by Mr Wolfowitz in an address to delegates at
an Asian security summit in Singapore at the weekend, and reported today by
German newspapers Der Tagesspiegel and Die Welt.
Asked why a nuclear power such as North Korea was being treated differently
from Iraq, where hardly any weapons of mass destruction had been found, the
deputy defence minister said: "Let's look at it simply. The most important
difference between North Korea and Iraq is that economically, we just had no
choice in Iraq. The country swims on a sea of oil."
Mr Wolfowitz went on to tell journalists at the conference that the US was
set on a path of negotiation to help defuse tensions between North Korea and
its neighbours - in contrast to the more belligerent attitude the Bush
administration displayed in its dealings with Iraq.
His latest comments follow his widely reported statement from an interview
in Vanity Fair last month, in which he said that "for reasons that have a
lot to do with the US government bureaucracy, we settled on the one issue
that everyone could agree on: weapons of mass destruction."
Prior to that, his boss, defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, had already
undermined the British government's position by saying Saddam Hussein may
have destroyed his banned weapons before the war.
Mr Wolfowitz's frank assessment of the importance of oil could not come at a
worse time for the US and UK governments, which are both facing fierce
criticism at home and abroad over allegations that they exaggerated the
threat posed by Saddam Hussein in order to justify the war.
Amid growing calls from all parties for a public inquiry, the foreign
affairs select committee announced last night it would investigate claims
that the UK government misled the country over its evidence of Iraq's WMD.
The move is a major setback for Tony Blair, who had hoped to contain any
inquiry within the intelligence and security committee, which meets in
secret and reports to the prime minister.
In the US, the failure to find solid proof of chemical, biological and
nuclear arms in Iraq has raised similar concerns over Mr Bush's
justification for the war and prompted calls for congressional
investigations.
Mr Wolfowitz is viewed as one of the most hawkish members of the Bush
administration. The 57-year old expert in international relations was a
strong advocate of military action against Afghanistan and Iraq.
Following the September 11 terror attacks on the World Trade Centre and
Pentagon, Mr Wolfowitz pledged that the US would pursue terrorists and "end"
states' harbouring or sponsoring of militants.

I'd queried the CIA electronically some time ago about two things: (1)
whether the organization knew anything about the death and possible
assassination of Senator Paul Wellstone, and (2) whether the organization
had assassinated Paul Wellstone.

This is the CIA's reply. I guess they don't do domestic assassinations.

Is there any written record of how Gertrude Stein wrote her texts? I.e., has
she or anybody observing her while she wrote written of how she wrote what
she wrote? Was it simply a standard free-association type process as is
often claimed, or did she make emendations, etc.? Were there dictionaries or
other reference texts she consulted? Did she ever outline chapters, keep
lists of characters, employ abstract structural techniques, etc.?

I am trying to distinguish between speculation and actual evidence here.
What do we actually know of Stein's working methods?

Do look at the new book on Stein called Gertrude Stein: The Language that
Rises by Ulla E. Dydo (Northwestern University Press).  I've begun reading it for
review.  Terribly detailed!  It will certainly inform you.

Yep. The CIA has been working overtime in an attempt to prove Saddam had
the stockpiles of WMD we helped him build up. Its staff had no time to
reply to you, GG.

Excuse me.

That's the old story.

Wolfowitz said that the WMD claim was a war-starting ruse/negotiating ploy.

It was about the oil. The oil, Gabe!! You see it's much more complex than
you radical knee-jerk conspiracy pinkoes always make it out to be. It's
about all that oil. It's about all that oil in which Iraq swims. I mean WE
were the ones telling anyone who would listen that it was about tons and
tons illegal weapons, ridding the world tyrannical despots and making it a
better place for democracy. I mean, it was about oil. The oil, Guh!!

This discussion seems destine toward an ever-recursive referral to
philosophical theoreticians, so I'll toss in Piaget on children learning
language.  Somewhere in the recesses of my mind (thirty years ago on child
development) he describes what Kirby is referring to here:

I wouldn't see these as prosaic as it was from observations like this that
Paiget's theories grew.  If my recollections serve me at all here, Chomsky's
first claim to fame in the sixties was championing empirical or prosaic
observation of language learning and he came down on Piaget's side contra
Freud on the idea that there is an unconscious.  I could supply more names
here but have not seen evidence that anyone here is curious enough to read
on the expansion of the preconscious? [possibly not sexy enough to generate
discussion]

K. McElderry Books/Simon & Schuster).  It was inspired by Bob Grumman's
mathemakus.  In the book, words take the place of numbers in all types of math
problems:  addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, graphs,
fractions, and
more.

The Case for War Relied On Selective Intelligence

Bush Team Bypassed Internal Disputes In Laying Out Evidence of Iraqi
Weapons

By DAVID S. CLOUD

Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

WASHINGTON -- In a classified report last fall, the Central Intelligence
Agency concluded that Iraq appeared to have resumed work on obtaining
nuclear weapons -- a finding that President Bush began trumpeting.

But one important fact was kept secret: Some State and Energy department
analysts dissented, arguing there wasn't enough evidence to support that
conclusion. "Whole agencies ... were in disagreement" with the October
report, says Greg Thielmann, an intelligence official at the State
Department who was responsible for Iraq until retiring last fall.

The episode underscores an important point about prewar U.S.
intelligence findings on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction: Much of it
wasn't very solid, and the fragmentary information sometimes produced
fierce internal disagreements about its meaning.

Yet those shades of gray were washed out in pronouncements by
administration policy makers eager to win United Nations support for
military action. The transformation of intelligence from uncertain
analysis to seemingly hard fact lies at the heart of a burgeoning
political storm over how information on Iraqi weapons was gathered,
analyzed and disseminated.

Worried that intelligence agencies could face blame for providing poor
information, officials at some agencies have begun defending their work
more openly in recent days. "The process was somewhat reversed -- not
intelligence informing policy, but policy makers going to the
intelligence community to find ways to sell the policy that was
predetermined," says a senior intelligence analyst involved in Iraq.

Doug Feith, undersecretary for defense policy, contested that complaint
as controversy about the matter escalated Wednesday. At an unusual
Pentagon news conference called to dispute reports his office had set up
a small team of analysts to supplement the CIA's work, Mr. Feith said he
didn't know of pressure by Pentagon officials on CIA or other analysts
to conform to the administration's view of the threat posed by Iraq.
"This suggestion that we said to them, 'This is what we're looking for,
go find it,' is precisely the inaccuracy that we are here to rebut," he
asserted.

But there is no sign the issue is going away. Several congressional
committees have announced inquiries into U.S. intelligence on Iraq. The
CIA itself has brought back several former analysts to compare prewar
intelligence reports with whatever is found in Iraq to assess whether
there were flaws. Democratic presidential candidate Bob Graham said
Wednesday that President Bush should be held accountable if intelligence
was exaggerated. "It would raise serious questions about the political
leadership that engaged in that manipulation and the misleading of the
American people," said Mr. Graham, former chairman of the Select
Committee on Intelligence.

This week, the British Parliament launched two similar investigations,
and Mr. Bush's strongest wartime ally, Prime Minister Tony Blair, has
suffered significant political damage over the weapons issue. "The whole
credibility of his government depends on clearing this up," said Iain
Duncan Smith, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, which
strongly backed the war.

Intelligence officials insist they didn't overstate what they knew. They
say agencies were scrupulous about including contrary evidence and
agency disagreements in formal reports presented to senior officials.
That approach was dictated by CIA Director George Tenet, who since the
Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has worried about criticism of the quality of
U.S. intelligence.

But Mr. Tenet, despite close relations with the president, couldn't stop
administration officials from dropping those nuances when they made
their arguments against Iraq. "He tells them this ... is how we would
say it, but if somebody decides to do it differently, that's OK,"
explains a senior intelligence official. Mr. Tenet, whose spokesman said
he wasn't granting interviews, released a statement saying, "The
integrity of our process was maintained throughout, and any suggestion
to the contrary is simply wrong."

White House officials say that Mr. Bush and other officials were careful
in public statements not to exaggerate what was known about Iraq's
weapons activities. It is also still possible that significant weapons
stockpiles or documents revealing more about what Iraq was doing will be
uncovered in coming months and years, they say. "It's a process that
continues, and it will take a lot of time," White House spokesman Scott
McClellan said.

Days after completion of October's formal assessment of Iraq's weapons
programs, Mr. Bush himself glossed over a debate on whether the
attempted purchase of aluminum tubes was evidence of an active nuclear
program. CIA weapons experts insisted the tubes were suitable as rotors
for gas centrifuges used in making nuclear-weapons material. But
analysts from the Department of Energy's nuclear labs were dubious,
according to officials involved. They argued that coatings on the tubes
aimed at preventing corrosion were inconsistent with use in centrifuges.
More likely, the tubes were intended for making rockets, some U.S.
analysts argued.

In a speech in Cincinnati on Oct. 7, Mr. Bush made no reference to this
disagreement. "Iraq has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum
tubes and other equipment needed for gas centrifuges, which are used to
enrich uranium for nuclear weapons," he said.

Secretary of State Colin Powell spent days culling intelligence about
Iraq's weapons activities before his Feb. 7 presentation to the U.N.
Security Council. He decided not to refer to an intelligence report that
Iraq had sought to purchase uranium oxide -- material for nuclear
weapons known as yellow cake -- from African countries, including Niger.
According to two senior officials, some U.S. intelligence analysts had
been suspicious for months of the reports, one of which was later deemed
a forgery.

Yet only a month earlier, Mr. Bush had cited one of the reports in his
State of the Union address. "The British government has learned that
Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from
Africa," he said.

Officials now conclude the U.S.'s ability to see inside Iraq's weapons
programs was always sketchy. Analysts across the intelligence community
were in rough agreement that Iraq probably had hidden stocks of chemical
nerve agents. An unclassified version of October's report on Iraq's
weapons activities asserted that "Baghdad has begun renewed production
of chemical warfare agents." Yet none have been found so far in more
than a month of searching by Pentagon inspectors.

Bush administration officials suggest that Iraq destroyed its weapons
stocks just before the troops arrived. But some experts have a different
theory. They say Iraq may have been focused on keeping intact the
brainpower and hardware for making chemical and biological agents -- not
on producing the weapons themselves.

Iraq had made biological and chemical weapons in the past. Restarting
production would have been easy -- once the inspectors went away -- as
long as facilities and scientists were available, but getting caught
with actual weapons stockpiles was too risky, this theory holds.

Subject: [gulfwar-2] Guardian Retracts, Apologizes For False
Straw/Powell "It's All About Oil" Story

 From <http://www.news24.com/News24/World/Iraq/0,,2-10-
1460_1369424,00.html>:

--snip--
Although The Guardian earlier reported that US deputy defence
secretary, Paul
Wolfowitz had said that the Iraq war was all about oil, the newspaper
has now
removed the article from its web site, and will print a full correction
in Friday's
edition. According to the Guardian's ombudsman, the quote, "Let's look
at it simply.
The most important difference between North Korea and Iraq is that
economically, we
just had no choice in Iraq. The country swims on a sea of oil," was
taken out of
context, and misconstrued.
--snip--

An early version of the aforementioned correction ran today. From
<http://
www.guardian.co.uk/corrections/story/0,3604,970468,00.html>:

--snip--
Thursday, June 5, 2003

In our front page lead on May 31 headlined "Straw, Powell had serious
doubts over
their Iraqi weapons claims," we said that the foreign secretary Jack
Straw and his US
counterpart Colin Powell had met at the Waldorf Hotel in New York
shortly before Mr
Powell addressed the United Nations on February 5. Mr Straw has now
made it clear
that no such meeting took place. The Guardian accepts that and
apologises for
suggesting it did.
--snip--

The Guardian retraction comes on the same day this article ran in The
Scotsman
<http://www.thescotsman.co.uk/index.cfm?id=623512003>, via <http://
www.instapundit.com/archives/009907.php#009907>:

--snip--
ALONE in a national newspaper industry congenitally reluctant to
correct its mistakes,
the Guardian has an exemplary record: its famous "corrections and
clarifications"
column has even been turned into a book.

All the more mysterious, therefore, that it has yet to correct or
clarify its Saturday
page-one splash which alleged that Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary,
and his US
counterpart, Colin Powell, met in New York's Waldorf Hotel just before
a crucial UN
session on Iraq on 5 February and moaned to each other about the poor
quality of
their intelligence on Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction.

Some sort of clarification, at the very least, is surely in order
because no evidence has
yet been produced to show that the alleged meeting between Mr Powell
and Mr Straw
ever took place, much less that they said what the Guardian alleges. .
. .

The story's provenance is not helped by the joint byline: Richard
Norton-Taylor is an
experienced correspondent on intelligence matters, but his name comes
after Dan
Plesch, who is not even a journalist but a "defence expert" who was
opposed to the
Iraq war and whose commentaries at the start of hostilities have not
stood the test of
time.

Oh, I know.   Thank you, just the same, for letting me know, though.  Sorry
if my post suggested that.
Anastasios also wrote, "I think that the Guardian must be getting some

Ah, yes, maybe they're getting some unexpected heat.  Thank you for
mentioning that, too.  Personally, I'm so darn conditioned at times these
days to feel that they can escape from any criticism and reality that's
thrown back in their faces(s) that I immediately thought, "Shoot, now they
caught the good Guardian in a lie.  Damn."  Your take, however, is sturdier
and tougher and thus inspires me to check my "giving up so easily."  So,
Yes, maybe they're getting some unexpected, but that in itself is good (More
Heat all around), and "external sources" means, one day, more scabs to
unearth later...
Very best regards, Steve

Tom Bell,

Part of the problem here is that I don't know psychology very well.  Yes, I've
read most of the major texts of  Freud and Jung and some of Lacan, but Piaget is
just a name to me.  Is he being shot to pieces like the other three?  I've heard
that Chomsky's linguistic theories have been shot to pieces, but it's not my
domain, so I don't know.  That's hearsay.

As far as preconscious goes -- I don't know this term.  I wouldn't mind reading
Piaget.

I teach philosophy, so I happen to know it, but some parts better than others.
I am pretty much only interested in aesthetic theory now, especially in how it
relates to cities (the categories of the Kantian period, sublime, beautiful, and
Gilpin's addition the picturesque -- and how they are being played out in urban
planning -- many folks that is are trying to use these categories to develop a
standard for what the national heritage foundations should attempt to save --
I'm interested in how poetry might play a role in this via poet's descriptions
of places they consider sacred).

But I also want to rescue the idea of language as description in order to do
this.  How did my boy's language intersect with Piaget?  Is there a short
crucial text of his that I could start with to get a flavor?  He's at least
French, so that might make him sexy to others.  Or was he Swiss or Belgian.  His
name sounds French -- Jean Piaget, I think.  My mom was a reading teacher and
taught first grade so I remember seeing those books in the house.  Piaget was
blown off the map by something called the whole word movement.  My mom was
furious because she didn't think whole word worked.  Maybe Piaget has staged a
comeback, though.  I remember reading something that said he did in some journal
for teachers.  I sent it to my mom and she was pretty happy to hear about it,
because I believe that she thought he was dead on in terms of his accuracy and
methodology, whatever it was.  I remember my mother taught using a system called
phonics.

Most of what I've posted over the last few weeks is I think related to the
preconscious.  I hate to resort to spatial metaphors as that's what gets
peoples' thinking confused when they thin of the unconscious as a space but
I don't see any way around it.  The preconscious can be visualized as the
body of the iceberg with a 'visible' top that is consciousness and maybe a
base that is the unconscious and eighty percent in between the base and the
top or tip.

I'm not up to date on my reading but I think Damasio talks about this, as
does Polyani.  This might be what's called the liminal.  It can be made
conscious with work and its effects on thinking and perception can be
measured.

You Alice Doesn't Live (T)here Anymore



            "What happens when we lose the other side?"

            In a subtle movement through those invisible spaces that
separated here from there, Alice disappeared without a trace into an
unnatural photograph. A spring downpour washed away the faint and
schizophrenic footsteps of Alice's slightly curious departure. No one, not
even Alice, knew where she had arrived. Her flight down into this little
peep of the passageway is now only remembered inside tidy bedtime stories
that fathers use against their daughters' desires. Stories told before night
falls in order to keep them locked in childhood innocence. Safe and still.
There, and there alone, Alice remains forlorn and sweet. Light forehead
kisses like breath over a mirror from forgotten fathers. The helpless bodies
of Alice's sisters and daughters tucked inside sheets, frozen beneath the
weight of shabby blankets. Girls everywhere being told to sleep tight and to
dream well. Princes will charm you with their kisses early in the morning.

            But Alice feared that she would never again awaken. Before
falling asleep, she worried that she would become stranded in red corridors
with billowing white curtains. She suffered the joy of being photographed by
her dreams of unborn, unbound daughters. Alice worried that all infant
traveling that she did while sleeping would be captured and spoken over in
the voices of strangers.

            Alice lost herself.

            In a blink.

            She caught herself in a mirror looking, a child of tears
suspended between doubts and dreaming.

            A lonely girl, Alice's older sister, pressed her hand on the
dark wall where the mirror used to be. Alice herself was no longer there;
she had become absent and could only enter her sister's life through stolen
photographs. Torn photographs of broken dolls, girls with black hair,
twisted and matted, crippled girls with mouths that had been cut open in the
belief of a promised land were scattered everywhere in Alice's memory. Her
voice in the stillness became lost in the desert that arrives before
looking. Her hand reached out from the taint of the missing looking-glass.
At times the terror of her own reflection took over the real. There was no
way out of that place, out of the present, because her trauma had cut into
her body and lived there alive in marks on the inside of her skin. She no
longer could look out away from her looking.

            Alice had grown tired of eavesdropping. As a child she used to
peep into her older sister's books, but her sister's books were always
without a place for looking. Now Alice had slipped and become caught inside
one of these nearly impossible books. A hopeless book without dialogue.
Silent readers rubbed their fingers over her breathing. Bread crumb trails.
Her words. Drawn and quartered photographs from the land of broken sins.
Readers following and following their own needs to turn the page, to see
Alice growing bigger and bigger and smaller and smaller. She never was one
to remain still. With each touch she changed. Abrasions of her skin were
torn from the material of her body as she slipped away into language. Still,
she left shreds of paper, fallen leaves from Mimosa trees, for her sister to
follow. To cling. "Come to me when I am not looking."

            Alice grew exhausted by the stares of old men. Abandoned
strangers in boats on the lake.

            "In a small cottage, I posed and I became exposed," Alice told
her sister. "I recall experiencing a mysterious thrill gazing up at my own
shape emerging from a negative clipped to a string. Day after day, I watched
myself in the dark room of his stories."

            Alice wanted to escape truth and avoid guilt, so she sewed words
beneath the hem of her dress, and she smiled and twisted her body into
playful moments that broke the trust of those watching her. "I just wanted
to be a happy girl that refused to be really frightened." Alice sought
uncertainty. She wanted to transform her skin from the reflection of other's
desires into her own speech. Alice tried to look the other way. Just outside
the mirror she caught a glimpse of her sister reading a book that appeared
and disappeared.

            "This is the photograph you stole," she whispered to her older
sister, "and you are the woman. I am."

            Alice never believed.

            Her older sister warned her. Slapped her wrists. On her lap she
held books. Opened books with pages and pages of ink. Spilled desires. She
rarely ever lifted her eyes. Alice stood beside her sister with her hand
resting on her shoulder. She watched her sister wet the tip of her index
finger and turn another page. Without looking away from her book, Alice's
sister spoke.

            "Be careful around the outside of mirrors, Alice."

            "You may fall in."

            Looking glass deceptions threatened to become flesh before the
word. She told Alice stories of other tiny girls that had been cut to pieces
by the broken glass. "You're living there as unfinished, as perishable as a
flower inside your reflection." Alice wondered about her sister's own
reflection. The one she saw in her sister's vanity.

            Alice began dreaming after a fashion to be here before the eyes
of her victims. To remain not yet a woman of her own. In the mirror, a girl
once surprised Alice into looking away from her own body. Alice held this
girl by her hand. She became invisible and unknown.

            "When was the last time you recognized yourself?"

            Alice waited.

            She invited them to look into her, to grow suspicious of their
own desires. They loved to stare at her with their frenzied eyes. Her opened
mouth. A kind of benediction. The moment before prayers. She wanted to trap
each man, to force each one to look back at their own reflections. She
wished to violate their eyes with her body. To be captured in the gaze by
the purveyors of the plague. Each morning, she awaited the stares of these
men with derelict desires. Men who arrested her on the taint of the mirror.
A paused image that stuttered near the tremble of knowing. They told her
lies. They did not know that Alice knew these were the lies of greedy men in
despair. They told her that dirty knees were the sign of an innocent girl.
She, because she knew what could not be said, shifted her weight from one
hip to the other. Her mouth had edges. They took first one photograph then
another. Photograph after photograph. She lived in this world of photographs
without end.

            "I can only see what I've already seen."

            Like a photograph whose images continue to emerge.

            In the basement Alice became an archive of still life portraits
and reflections. Image after image fractured. No longer an outside. She
longed to find her way to be on the inside. Away from the deprivation of
looking. Here, Alice desired a witness. One that could escape to tell what
she had seen. "Tell me one story," she pleaded, "that is not afraid of
truth."  These men became guilty with looking. Someone had written on her
eyes with desires that did not belong to her. Alice feared she would be
condemned to only ending up in a book. One without drawings. She tore her
sister's books into pieces when her sister was not looking. Alice feared
that her all her life would be trapped inside one of these silent books. She
feared these deaf and dumb books would kill her daughters.

Alice was no longer there.

            Alice remained silent. She existed simply as this incompletion
of words. Wanted only to live on the inside before the making possible of
forgetting. She carried with her too great a weight of untold stories. This
weight of memories. Ghosts that haunted her. She could not name these ghosts
from her past. Wanted only to speak one sentence to her sister. But her
breathing hesitated. Not one single memory of her childhood could break
free. She longed for her own echo. Desired a way to travel back into the
taint of the mirror.

            Alice wanted to stay on the inside of sleep. To be covered by
the dead leaves of nearly lost memories. "Wake up, Alice dear!" Her sister's
voice from a distance. Alice remained with her dreams. She whispered back to
her sister from the inside of her long sleep and carried her sister,
remembering her own child-life, with her to the place before sacrifice.

Subject:      Rimbaud bios
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

  Hello Maria and others who have posted to this thread,

    I read the Robb biography about 2 and a half years ago which started me on a Rimbaud quest and I have read many of the
available bios since then (also some of the original French sources such as the memoirs written by Rimbaud's friend Delahaye and
teacher Izambard).  I think Graham Robb's biography is probably the most complete, unified and accurate in English - one valuable
central point is Robb's trying to provide a more balanced, less 'myth-based" accounting of Rimbaud's life than other earlier bios such
as Enid Starkie's picture of Rimbaud as a failed, burnt-out romantic who spent the last eleven years of his life wandering aimlessly
and being taken advantage of by other, supposedly more "worldly" types.  In fact, as Robb is careful to show, Rimbaud was very
good at his trading and commerce activities in Africa, actually much more so than most of the other European traders/explorers of
that time, as he was much more open to a radical alteration in his own life-style, lived most of his years in Africa and the Middle
East pretty simply, close to the indigenous way of life, adopted local customs and even dress at times, and spoke most of the local
languages fluently.  He had a true passion for travel which I think Robb depicts very well.  Charles Nicholls' Somebody Else:
Arthur Rimbaud in Africa is very enjoyable and thorough re that aspect of his life, though it is a much more personal and
subjective book than Robb's, as Nicholls sets out on his own road trip to retrace Rimbaud's steps and writes about that as well.
Rimbaud's own letters, as well as those of his sister Isabelle and a few of his mother's, are available in his Ouevres completes and
are very revealing and fascinating and are a great complement to Robb's book.

    In the October 2002 issue of Harper's, Wyatt Mason critiques the Robb bio (rather unfairly) as well as several others - he
actually does find an instance where Robb appears to have extrapolated a little too wildly on one of Rimbaud's known comments
(issue at point is whether Rimbaud actually did ejaculate into a glass of Carbaner's milk or just said that he did to shock people -
evidence seems to show the latter is probably true while Robb indicates the former).  Mason does acknowledge than Robb's
biography is written so well and has such a strong dramatic and narrative drive to it.  In this article Mason refers to a recent bio that
is currently only available in French, Arthur Rimbaud by Jean-Jacques Lefrere - which is 1200 pages long and incredibly
complete.  I managed to obtain a copy through inter-library loan and was able to get through the first 200 pages in the time I had it
(I plan to buy my own copy later this year) - Lefrere is almost obsessively thorough in unearthing any possible scrap of docmentary
evidence, to the point of giving us the family histories of each of Rimbaud's teachers at the College de Charleville - I did learn
something new from reading those 200 pages - Rimbaud at age 14 was already set on traveling to Ethiopia to be an explorer -
actually made a pact with two of his slightly older classmates, who were seminary students, to each learn one of the necessry
languages for such a trip - Rimbaud chose to begin studying amharic (the predominate language of Ethiopia), while the others began
studying Arabic and Porteguese.  This tidbit seems to be corroborated by letters that have been found in which the two seminary
students were actually expelled or suspended from the seminary for studying "un-Christian languages").  I think this is fascinating as
it shows that far from being a lost wanderer, Rimbaud actually ended up exactly where he wanted to go.  Another tidbit I learned
from Lefrere is that there is some evidence that Rimbaud was actually engaged, informally, in obtaining information for the French
government -

    I think Robb does a really excellent job of showing how deep an impact both of Rimbaud's parents had on him .  Much of what I
have responded to has been the passion and human integrity with which he lived his life, also the poignancy of his final months of
suffering after he developed cancer and his right leg was amputated.  Of course he was filled with his own human contradictions,
eccentricities  and inconsistencies - for example, perpetuating  his own type of racism and colonialism even though he was much
more sympathetic to Arabic and African cultures than most Europeans of the time).

    Rimbaud it seems to me is an archetypal and alchemical figure and everyone is inevitably going to respond to him in their own
way.   My own response has been to write a series of poems based on his life (two have just come out in the current issue of
Spoon River).  And there is the whole issue of  responding to Rimbaud's own writings, which seem to me to be wonderfully
non-linear - each time I reread one of his prose poems it is as though I had never read it before - somehow the way he is writing
doesn't seem to want to imprint on my conscious mind but must impact or be processed on another level -

    By the way, in reading Neruda's Memoirs I discovered that Neruda actually had a photo of Rimbaud on his writing desk, and
owned two of the original letters that Rimbaud's sister Isabelle wrote to their mother while she was staying with Rimbaud during his
final few months in the hospital in Marseilles - a friend of his (a French writer, can't remember which one) gave him the letters as a
birthday present.

    best wishes,

I agree with you, Anastasios: The Guardian's "correction" certainly did not appear to invalidate its original reading of Wolfowitz's comment, which clearly implied that we would not attack North Korea because--unlike Iraq--it has no resource we could draw upon to pay for the cost of the attack (not to mention to profit from for years in the future). It feels as if someone leaned on Wolfowitz for his excessive candor, who may then have contacted Blair's cronies, who then leaned on The Guardian, which sought to appease its critics by way of an ambiguous apology. Of course we did it for the oil!

Philosophy Text of the Northern Trek


We ran off, it was an exciting escape! We left the ruined snowmobile at
3000 meters and began our slow trek northward. We went passed fallen
ski-lifts, half choked by glaciers, cormorants nesting among the rusted
cables. We continued northward. Anything to escape the wars and slaughters
in the south. In the south, humanity was disappearing; blind animals died
sullenly beneath the noon-day sun. We walked across the upper crusts of
the glacial beds, crevices everywhere. Some disappeared, the rest of us
continued to the station. We hoped for signs of life. We were disappointed
at the ruined station. Corroded batteries were everywhere. The fury had
hit; we thought it stopped elsewhere. Everywhere the planet shuddered; the
obscene auroras with their unearthly colors reflected the future of the
world. "Stop Here" he said. "This is as far as we can go." But the rest of
us left, and continued our trek. He was speaking to himself now, mumbling
and describing the death of billions. Breathless, we approached the frozen
waters of the polar ocean. The last remnants of surface life moved slowly
to the meandering field of true north. Unaware of global precession, our
trek continued, shuddering in our tracks. The nights were harsh with
bioluminescent fury beneath the missiles overhead. They crawled, exploded
across the sky, raining radioactive debris into the frozen north. Metal
fragments burned through the ice in fiery storms. We watched silently,
vowing to remain there, as the ice began to crack. We heard shouts of
"Open water!" over and over again... ...We held on for dear life to the
last vestiges of the polar ice...

“Our future looks sunny and fun”



What is the purpose of this visit?  Does every song mean to end memorably?
What did the memo say?  Clipboard contains required paperwork
hand from above.  Leather gloves and belt in strong-arm kiosk roadsides
vehicles
guts inside.  Peep from glass nose over.  Stop.
Fire from the wood know dances hidden with ribbon from belt buckles
like May Day if September may replace smog with clock radios.  Blink alarm
off.
String section carefully brings back bows; head to chest cough butt of to.
To open lungs, A.M. shutters to noonday sun.
To cease, light finds tangents at ball bearings and perhaps medicine balls;
a gown to abandon waves and particles as light theory.
Traffic turns orange; light turns corners.

Which answer is the simplest?  This answer must be correct.  Forget graphs
and charts.
Street forges summer snowstorm through overanalysis.
Center sky so bright shadow cannot hide.  Smile hooks eyes upward as eyes
doe eternally.  Children are bobby soxers, poodle skirts are propellers.
Throw the blade to the ground spins upward; wind curls under hypothesis.
There is a magnifying glass in sand.  Chew on grind down teeth.
Speak endlessly and laugh; smile when observing.  Is this needed to prove
anything?

The sun will not set despite trying.  Breathes heavy.  Where will the sun
set to?

The sun is on a towering double helix.  Administration offices suspend on
tight wires,
while senior politicos oversee movement curves measure cosines.
A political giggle.  Holsters hiccup at flatbed trucks for unacceptable
shipments
don’t smile enough don’t scuff knees enough don’t play ball.

But historical analysis dumps dreaming as a social pheromone.
Precise instrumentation locks readings as dent hammers swing
armour into amour for knock knee kids dancing cholera in the water.  Okay to
swim,
okay to drink.  Bottom is black but sky back refractfully.  Black turns
attractive.

On March 20, 2003, the clock reverses.  Sundials cease.
Outer casing cracks; latch is improper.  Springs break as paper swings
pendulous match sticks down like snow.  Every song means to end memorably
fade out or.  Dance in circles cracks underfoot
clues to retract gears and stones swing arcs so buoyant that tanks can’t
orient with the sun
constantly overhead.  The sun swings without gravity.  A fixed point.

Waiting on an airstrip.  Four airplanes.

Hi,

Does anyone know where I can get a copy of Stephen Rodefer's ONE OR TWO LOVE
POEMS FROM THE WHITE WORLD? It's an old favorite, and my copy seems to have
disappeared one or two moves ago.

Thanks.

  TINA LA PORTA - TOTAL SCREEN
Curated by Jennifer Farrell
Presented by White Box

June 5 - June 28, 2003
Opening reception Thursday June 5, 6-8 PM

Total Screen, a multi-media installation gathered from a wide range of
media
sources dealing with representations of gender during times of bellic
conflict.
Using photography, text, and photosilkscreened images, La Porta shows how
the veil, hijab, burka and chador function as powerful cultural symbols.
Moving
beyond religious connotations, La Porta uses the veil to represent the
media's
"veiling" of information--the presentation of news through a limited
perspective--
and her attempt to uncover what is hidden under mediated wartime
propaganda.
Total Screen examine the power of such images to portray notions of gender
and cultural differences that correspond to and encourage Western
stereotypes
of the Middle East. Promulgated by the Orientalist school of thought,
prevalent
in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th Century.

As La Porta states "Since 9/11, I have been researching text and
collecting images
from a wide variety of media sources including the internet, television
and print
media, focusing on how we are experiencing the recent wartime events in
Afghanistan and the Middle East region through the news media from a
distance.
I decided to pay special attention to representations of gender via the
veil, hijab,
burka or chador. The gender differences between the veiled woman and the
masked man is of particular interest to a western audience just becoming
exposed
to the eastern practices of covering. However, an additional reading of
the work
is the consideration of the media as veil, or--an attempt to unveil (see
through) the media."

A panel discussion entitled "What is Orientalism? A Cross-Cultural
Dialog in Times of Global Conflict" will be held 11 June, 7 PM at the
Annex with panelists including Eleanor Heartney,  Shiva Balaghi,
Tala Dowlatshahi, Persheng Vazari and moderated by Rashmi Jaipal.

Kenneth Goldsmith
DAY
(836 pages, $20.00)


"I am spending my 39th year practicing uncreativity. On Friday, September 1, 2000, I
began retyping the day's New York Times, word for word, letter for letter, from the upper
left hand corner to the lower right hand corner, page by page."

With those words, Kenneth Goldsmith embarked upon a project which he termed "uncreative
writing," that is: uncreativity as a constraint-based-process; uncreativity as a creative
practice. As Goldsmith claims, "It's one of the hardest constraints a writer can muster,
particularly on a project of this scale; with every keystroke comes the temptation to
fudge, cut-and-paste, and skew the mundane language. But to do so would be to foil the
exercise."

Long an advocate of extreme writing processes ? recording every move his body has made in
a day (Fidget), recording every word he spoke over the course of a week (Soliloquy),
recording every phrase he heard ending in the sound of "r" for four years (No. 111) ?
Goldsmith now turns his attention to quotidian documents.

By typing page upon page, making no distinction between article, editorial and
advertisement, disregarding all typographic and graphical treatments, Goldsmith levels
the daily newspaper, reducing it to mere text. From the  stock quotes to the Macy's ads,
everything is assigned equal weight.

What emerges is a monument to the ephemeral, comprised of yesterday's news: a fleeting
moment concretized, captured, then reframed into the discourse of literature.

With this simple act of transcription, Goldsmith critiques the culturally cherished
values of creativity and originality in writing. Following the traditions of Duchamp's
Fountain (1917) and Andy Warhol's work in the visual arts, or the ubiquitous practices of
sampling and plunderphonics in contemporary music, Goldsmith asks, "Nearly one hundred
years after Duchamp, why hasn't appropriation become a valid, sustained or even tested
literary practice?"

But there's also something of an alchemist in Goldsmith, thus evoking more Pierre Menard
than Jeff Koons. The text is full of formal choices and chockfull of hundreds of tiny
decisions, making Day a unique and playful work unto itself.

"Even John Cage, whose mission it was to accept all sound as music, ultimately failed;
his filter was on too high," says Goldsmith. "However, if Cage claimed that any sound can
be music, then by extension we can conclude that, properly framed, any language can be
poetry."

"When I reach 40, I hope to have cleansed myself of all creativity."

Jerry Saltz
SEEING OUT LOUD: THE VILLAGE VOICE ART COLUMNS, FALL 1998 - WINTER 2003

"Jerry Saltz is the best informed and hair-trigger livliest of contemporary art critics,
tracking pleasure and jump-starting intelligence on the fly. Confirming the adage "first
thought best thought," Jerry's fast takes usually stand up better in retrospect than
other people's long views. This book preserves the crunch and heat of art's collisions
with life in these times."
-Peter Schjeldahl

"Jerry Saltz looks at art from the perspective of the viewer, the ignorant, the lover,
and the enemy. his writing is overwhelmingly passionate, yet without sentimentality. his
words pierce the content and beauty of each work of art to test its endurance in time and
memory."
- Franceso Bonami, Curator, 2003 Venice Biennale

LIGHTS OUT

Divided into seven sections, LIGHTS OUT takes the reader from the supple brevities of Et
toi, beaute, [put accent on the final e](leaning to the right)   to the longer poems in
Thrifty, Brave & Clean (which opens with "Drive, It Said," as a marriage ends, and closes
with "Elegy LY III," on the death of Young's father).  In the mini-classic of romantic
woe, The Dump, a series of short poems confesses the spectral tenderness of love and
loss, while memory and experience give shape to the writing in Ad-lib and Savoy, when
not pressing experimental ("Druid Lover / Squid Mover") or phrasal issues ("Text
Pre-op").  In a thousand word tour de force, Mount Trove Curry orchestrates an obsessive
formality, while Space Jam by Billy Higgins lets fly with jazz-driven lyric
insouciance--a lively coda to this poet's best work to date.

 Mariia, I think that the notion that there is an on-going and dominant 19th
century 'blind to the other' imperial voice among in USA poetry is off the
mark (the Voice of America(!?), other propaganda sources, and some poets
non-withstanding). I think it's important to point out poets who have made
important (& public) counter-imperial gestures & work. Here in SF in the
seventies (and perhaps repeated in New York) Ferlinghetti and Ginsberg
created and performed in venues with Russian counterparts - whose names I
will not misspell here. Later Lyn Hejinian, Barry Watten, Kit Robinson and
several others - including the Rova Saxaphone Quartet - built and maintained
on-going relationships with Russian poets in the eighties. Correspondingly
that have been many interesting translation and reading projects with both
Vietnamese and Chinese poets.
I will bet there are already similar International projects in relationship
to the artists and poets in Iraq (?). I can't imagine folks - on either
'side'  sitting idly  by while Rumsfeld-Bush-Cheney-Wolfolitz etc. attempt
to orchestrate what they deem will be culturally etc. valuable to the lives
in a 'liberated' Iraq.

As to the residual power of 'the imperial voice within' - that is the x
poets who continue to operate as if there is a central quo all powerful
voice in United States poetry - I think that's been under assault for
several decades now no matter hard institutions continue to implant that
notion and appoint such 'masters' to fulfill those chairs.  That 'tradition'
will probably stay with us for years. The Bush folks obviously love
maintaining "retro", if any culture at all.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=ISO-8859-1

from our friends at the Ruckus Society an djust in time for the week-end

http://www.warprofiteers.com/index.html


The War Profiteers Card Deck exposes some of the real war criminals in the
US’s endless War of Terror. This is no Sunday bridge club. These are
individuals and institutions that stack the deck against democracy in the
rigged game of global power. Exposing their place in the house of cards
illuminates the links among corporations, institutions, and government
officials that profit from endless war. The US War of Terror is not about
liberation, democracy, or UN resolutions. Plainly put, the War of
Terror--whether in Iraq, Colombia, Afghanistan, or the USA--is about
subjugation, resource extraction, and opening markets: a practice once
referred to more honestly as colonialism.

Each suit in this deck represents a category of war profiteers:

   Oil, gas, and energy companies
   US government officials (because they love you)
   Military and defense contractors
   Heads of industry, finance, media, policy, and hype

This deck is designed to support on-going campaigns against many of the
evil-doers present here. For more extensive information on each of the
players and how you can get involved, please refer to the links section at
the bottom of each profile.

I arrive in my work slanted from
birdsong. The wings I once
wounded for loving hang dis-
jointed or limp across my back.
Her bottomless moping pours
roles I could fake, imaginary or

safe, or chips the paint
from cinderblock to show
the moonhide pores that
can't breathe us in. You

scatter me, I say to her, or
even then confusion should
flourish. The sky today wants
nothing more or less than to
swallow what could be my voice,
yours, singing to myself the

signs. If we part, the whole of mornings
roams my skin, searching for holes that
might allow more furrowed spore. In a dark
or contemplative gesture, our breathing

evens. Even the dead need pillows
below our feet.  To sweeten a jagged
sky. To muffle what freezes under
your scold of blasting silence. But
you stir sometimes, watching the
world from our screened-in porch;
there some laughter just beneath you
when you tell me how you love those birds.

Whitman has been so pervasive an influence in Latin America that much of
its poetry is unthinkable without him.  I don't think Neruda, for example,
no supporter of US imperialism,  experienced him in the terms you suggest.

CALL FOR PAPERS

CONTEMPORARY ANTI-WAR MOBILIZATIONS
Agonistic Engagement Within Social Movement Networks

A two day workshop to be held in Corfu, Greece, November 6-7, 2003

The network perspective is often discussed in relation to social movements
and collective action. Key elements of the latter, such as actors,
agencies, organizations, institutions etc. witnessing, participating,
confronting or allying with social movements, can be studied in their
networked entanglements - consensual or conflictual, deliberative or
agonistic - at any level of collective action - local, national or global.

This international workshop seeks to explore a particular form of
contemporary social movements: anti-war mobilizations and peace movements,
increasingly connected with networked forms of collective action in the
era of globalization. In particular, we seek papers addressing one or more
of the following questions:

* How are national, subnational and transnational mobilizations
articulated to each other specially when they put forward distant issues
an in the case of the contemporary anti-war movements?
* What sort of networked patterns or organizational forms emerge from such
movements and how these expanded network structures are configuring or are
configured within broader political processes and global information
flows?
* Do the recent episodes of anti-war collective action cluster in emerging
cycles and waves of protest? Is their diffusion affected by the geographic
scale or on any other underlying heterogeneities?
* What kind of data or/and ethnomethodological work could properly map the
anti-war movement?
* What sort of causal models or agent-based simulations of evolving
dynamic and self-organizing networks could describe the dynamics of these
mobilizations?
* How do policies and politics over anti-war mobilizations relate to each
other? What is the response of the authorities or the state to this type
of contentious action? What is the interaction between anti-war protest
and repression?
* How is globalization connected with the upsurge of global terrorism
together with many other types of violence (state, racial, ethnic,
cultural or gender-based)?
* How do the modern states of emergency and risk society react against the
threads or accidents of network vulnerabilities, failures or collapses?
* Could modern movements as global anti-war protests be viewed as a
particular instance of reflexive remodernization?
* How public deliberation and pluralist democracy can foster inside the
radical agonistics against globalization?
* Can the democratization of science or the idea that 'another science is
possible' be advanced and sustained within these mobilizations?

The Workshop will be organized by Dr Iosif Botetzagias
(iosif_botetzagias@yahoo.co.uk) and Prof Moses Boudourides
(mboudour@upatras.gr), University of Patras, Greece. There are no
registration fees and delegates interested in participating will soon
receive information about hotels in Corfu and traveling within Greece.
Abstracts up to 250 words should be sent by email to one of the organizers
by July 15, 2003.

The Media Justice Fund supports local and national organizing efforts
aimed at media reform policies, open access to technology and
accountability by media corporations.  The Media Justice Fund promotes
projects that manifest strong collaborations between social justice and
media justice activists and agendas.

The Fund supports specific media justice organizing projects and
activities in the United States using three grant-making mechanisms:

* Annual grant-making for the development and dissemination of Media
Advocacy Toolkits,

* Annual grant-making for Pilot Media Advocacy Organizing Projects, and

* Immediate Response Grant-making to support organizations that
demonstrate both an immediate need for funding and a viable action plan in
response to unexpected developments in the field. (Guidelines for this
funding streamare below.)

A major goal of the Media Justice Fund is to reach grassroots, social
justice organizations interested in incorporating media advocacy into
their social justice work. These include organizations that are concerned
about the impact of media regulation on their communities, organizations
that want to support or create local independent media infrastructure and
organizations interested in developing media literacy.  The Fund gives
strong consideration to geographic, cultural, ethnic, and programmatic
diversity among the funded projects.

The Media Justice Immediate Response Fund

The Media Justice Immediate Response Fund makes grants in response to
quickly developing political situations in the media advocacy field. Media
Justice Immediate Response Fund grants may be used to support travel,
rallies, mailings, printing, materials and other costs associated with
political organizing activities. Grants are intended for use in mobilizing
and educating communities in situations where a small grant of up to
$3,000 can have a significant impact.

The Media Justice Immediate Response Fund does not make contributions
toward
on-going program work, salaries or matching grant campaigns, or to cover
debts or pay regular expenses.  Organizations may apply to this Fund only
once each calendar year.  However, an organization may apply for a Media
Justice Immediate Response grant and to other Media Justice Fund and
Funding Exchange programs in the same year.

To apply for a Media Justice Immediate Response grant mail, fax or email
to the FEX Grants Department the following information:

1. A two-page (maximum) description of the situation the organization is
trying to address.  Explain:

Why you believe the situation constitutes an emergency.

How this grant will make a difference to the work.

2. A detailed budget for the emergency activities being planned including
sources of other needed funds.

3. The total annual budget of the sponsoring organization.  A line item
breakdown is not necessary.

4. Clarification of your organization's or fiscal sponsor's tax- exempt
status.

5. Contact information, including the address, phone and fax numbers,
E-mail, and contact person.

Emergency Fund requests may be submitted at any time. The FEX Grants
Department will make a determination as quickly as possible, usually
within ten business days.

Applications for Media Justice Immediate Response Fund grants may be faxed
to: 212-982-9272;

ATTENTION: Media Justice Immediate Response Fund

or emailed to :

Anthony.riddle@fex.org

The Media Justice Fund is made possible by a generous grant of the Ford
Foundation.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Dear Friends,

On Friday, July 4th George W. Bush has been invited to
Philadelphia to attend the opening ceremony of the
National Constitution Center. A number of Philadelphia
area organizations and individuals, along with
representatives from national anti-war and peace and
justice organizations have come together to call for a
National Protest in Philadelphia on July 4th to Stop U.S.
Wars at Home and Abroad.

Unite to Demand a total change in priorities: **An End to
U.S. Occupation of Iraq -- Bring the Troops Home ** No
Endless Wars, Occupation, Colonialism or U.S. Empire **
Repeal the USA Patriot Act, Restore Civil Liberties, End
Election Fraud & Corruption ** No to Racism, Sexism, and
Attacks on Immigrants ** No to Privatization, Cuts in
Education, Welfare, Veterans & Other Benefits & Services
** Money for Human Needs -- Not the Pentagon War Machine

Bush lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and
continues to lie when he claims the war is over, as more
troops are being sent to crush Iraqi resistance to U.S.
occupation. The people of Iraq are without electricity,
drinkable water, or medical care as unexploded cluster
bombs, a cholera epidemic, and bullets fired by U.S.
troops claim more lives every day. The U.S. continues to
discuss plans for regime change, either through invasions,
economic pressure or stepped up covert operations, against
all those who attempt to retain nominal sovereignty over
their own land and natural resources. Syria, southern
Lebanon, Palestine, North Korea, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Iran,
Venezuela, Colombia, Haiti and other countries are slated
for aggression. Yet the Pentagon's $400 billion budget is
over 30 times the combined military spending of all the
countries targeted in Bush's endless war plans.

We have an unelected president who stole the election by
denying the Black vote in Florida. There has been a
wholesale assault on the Bill of Rights through the
passage of the USA Patriot Act and institutionalized
racial profiling. Imprisonment is at an all time high with
over 2.2 million incarcerated and over 3,000 are on death
row. Single mothers of color are the fastest growing
prison population. Thousands of immigrants, even U.S.
citizens, have been detained without charges or trial. Due
process continues to be denied for political prisoners
Mumia Abu-Jamal, Leonard Peltier, the Cuban 5 and others.
Racism is on the rise; Affirmative Action is under attack;
restitution for slavery, the slaughter of indigenous
people, and colonial occupation has not happened; and the
corporate media gives right-wing politicians carte blanche
to attack the rights of workers, people of color, women
and lesbian, gay, bi, and trans people.

The Executive Branch under Bush has taken on near
dictatorial powers - its decisions rubber-stamped by
Congress and the Supreme Court. The Bush wars for US
corporate interests require a massive transfer of wealth
from social programs. The administration hands out
lucrative contracts to Bechtel, Halliburton, and Exxon,
and it has engineered over $2 trillion in tax giveaways
that primarily benefit the very rich. But the majority in
the U.S face record high unemployment; cuts in spending
for public transportation, housing, welfare, education,
childcare, veterans and HIV/AIDS benefits; and the closing
of hospitals, libraries, drub rehab centers and more, as
states are forced to balance their budgets because
Washington won't. The income gap is widening. According to
the Department of Labor, in the 1980's, income for the
average CEO was 40 times that of the average worker. Today
the difference is 531 times. Women earn 73% of what men
earn, 63% for Black women and 53% for Latina women while
women's caring work remains unvalued and unwaged.

But we do not face these difficult times without hope.
Millions of people from all walks of life came together in
this country and around the world in an unprecedented
outpouring against war and for social justice, and we
can't give up now. Let's draw from our peoples' histories
of resistance to injustice and stand up to be counted. We
in Philadelphia have been solid in our unity. By making
our voices heard in protests, by entering the political
process directly, we the people become a decisive factor.
The eyes of the world will be on Philadelphia on July 4th.
We ask you to be here with us.

Much thanks for the mention, Maria, and in the
post-header, too!  Betsy said this in the book itself,
which was Very Nice and made me Very Happy and got me
Great Respect from several people at the high school I
substitute teach at to whom I showed the book, but
while I guess I did inspire her to do her own long
division math poems, she did many other kinds--and has
given me as many good ideas for future math poems as I
gave her, I'm sure.

Still, I'm as pleased with the excellent reviews
Betsy's book is getting as though it were my own!  And
I love the idea of elementary and middle school pupils
learning about one of the newest kinds of poetry being
composed sooner than college students.  (In class, I
mean.)

It has great illustrations, too.  Several of the poems
are visual as well as mathematical, too.

In the year 2003, the Read_me festival (http://www.m-cult.org/read_me) was held for the second
time, and for the first time in Helsinki. A year has passed since the first Moscow 2002 edition
(http://www.macros-center.ru/read_me), and the festival has grown and germinated through
Runme.org (http://runme.org) - the online software art repository it is now based on.

The idea of Read_Me 2.3 is to test an alternative festival model, especially since the subject of
the festival is software art, a realm where people with artists' self-identities coexist with
programmers whose views on the process of creation, distribution and even the very meaning of
their work can be dramatically different from those of the artists.

The current shape and organization of Read_Me is the result of a number of discussions and
analyses concerning the traditional schemes international media art festivals are based on, as
well as the organizational forms of open source developers communities.
Art festivals as widely accepted forms are often compromised by a lack of transparency in
submission and evaluation processes, which prevents interesting authors from submitting their
projects and generates quite problematic winners. Open source communities are much more
democratic, but have their own drawbacks: they focus on functionality and pragmatic usefulness,
thus sometimes leaving out interesting projects seen as unnecessary in these contexts.

In order to keep the advantages and avoid the disadvantages of the two realms a few steps have
been taken. An open, moderated software art repository Runme.org (http://runme.org) has been
developed and put up on the Net.
The web-site was developed creatively and in an excitingly short period of time by Alex McLean.
Amy Alexander participated largely in the testing, development and realization of the solutions
along with Alexei Shulgin and Olga Goriunova. The group of concept developers also included Pit
Schultz, Florian Cramer, Matthew Fuller, The Yes Men, and Thomax Kaulmann.

The first Read_me 1.2 was also based on an online database where all the entered projects were
stored, but the database was closed for new submissions after a pre-arranged deadline. The second
Read_me 2.3 is based on a database functioning parallel to and independent from the off-line
festival. Projects entered into Runme.org before a certain date were considered as entries for
the festival, but the submission of the works was not closed as the database was kept running on
a permanent basis.

Read_Me 2.3 has abandoned the monetary prize format, but has retained other features of the
festival: calls for submissions, an off-line event with invited participants, a book, etc.

Amy Alexander, Florian Cramer, Olga Goriunova, Matthew Fuller, Alex McLean, Alexei Shulgin,
and The Yes Men have reviewed the most interesting in their opinion submitted projects.
These projects were featured without ranking in order to avoid giving preference to one approach
over another.

The new experimental practice has yielded some unusual results. Since Runme.org was open for
submissions from everyone, and its developers have uploaded found projects and invited many
people to submit their works; the number of works uploaded onto Runme.org during the one and a
half month period from the launch to the festival deadline, reached 150, including a large number
of interesting works. That is why there were 47 works selected and featured by experts, with
other works to be reviewed later. This quite unexpected result of the experiment caused some
difficulties in the presentation of all the featured works at the festival, but was also very
positive and significant.

I'm helping Caterina Davinio with her English on a paper she's writing and
came across this sentence "In my performances the communic-action flux is
assumed as act/sign, introducing the necessity of a new semiotic to describe
the process."  This seems to suggest that in Italian, at least, a
communication action (or poem, etc) as a whole can be considered a
"semiotic".  It also makes me wonder if a visual poemwould be considered two
joined semiotics and a visual/animated/text work would be three?
thoughts appreciated.

"For the materialist dialectician, discontinuity is the regulative
idea of the tradition of the ruling classes (and therefore, primarily,
of the bourgeoisie; continuity, the regulative idea of the tradition
of the oppressed (and therefore, primarily, of the proletariat). The
proletariat lives more slowly than the bourgeois class. The examples
of its champions, the perceptions of its leaders, do not grow old, or,
at any rate, they grow old much more slowly than the epochs and great
personages of the bourgeois class. The waves of fashion break against
the compact mass of the downtrodden. The movements of the ruling
class, by contrast, having once come into their ascendency, maintain
in themselves a reference to fashion. In particular, the ideologies of
the rulers are by their nature more changeable than the ideas of the
oppressed. For not only must they, like the ideas of the latter, adapt
each time to the situation of social conflict, but they must glorify
that situation as fundamentally harmonious. Such a business is managed
only eccentrically and desultorily; it is modish in the fullest sense
of the word."

Walter Benjamin, The Arcades Project, page 364.


I. Norman Invasion

This lecture will begin by elaborating on details introduced on March
23, where as you may recall mention was made of the renewal of Danish
raids on England, which culminated in the reign of Canute and the
incorporation of England into the Scandinavian empire of Denmark and
Norway. In order to maintain control over England, Canute divided the
country into four major areas, each governed by an earl. Every effort
was made to continue the policies of the previous Anglo-Saxon
monarchy, and the reign of Canute was known as a peaceful one. This
king died in 1035, and with the death of both of his sons by 1040 the
Danish royal line in England came to an end. The throne of England
returned to the Anglo-Saxon monarchy when Edward the Confessor came
back to England after a 25-year exile in France. Upon his death in
1066, Harold Godwinson was elected to the throne (the crown was
elective in Anglo-Saxon England) at a time of increasing contention
for lands and power among the English nobility. There was a rebellion
in Northumbria, connected to a Norwegian expedition, which Harold
Godwinson defeated, only to be faced with the invasion of England by
William of Normandy, who claimed that Harold had sworn allegience to
him and his hereditary claim to the English throne on a visit to
Normandy. This is the story that is told in the famous Bayeux
Tapestry. Harold was killed at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, the
Anglo-Saxon monarchy came to an end, the nobility of Normandy took
possession of the lands and estates and leadership positions held by
the English nobility, and for a century and a half England was ruled
by a governing class which spoke another language than that of the
common people.

The date of 1066 is useful for marking the boundary between the Old
English and Middle English periods in the history of the language, but
as we shall see it is far more accurate to speak of a complex
transition due to foreign language influence, not only of French and
Latin but Scandinavian in the north, and the struggle for an English
language standard from among distinctly different regional
dialects. What happened after 1066? It is important to remember that
the King of England was also the duke of Normandy, and subject to the
King of France. In the 13th century, the French king made the Norman
nobles living in England surrender their estates on the continent,
furthering the growing separation of the French and English
nobility. This was accomplished in 1244 by the Decree of the Two
Masters. The Hundred Years War, which lasted from 1337-1453, ended in
the defeat of the English and the loss of nearly all English
possessions in France. Here's how Jane Zatta at Southern Illinois
University tells this history: "England and France had been complexly
interwoven ever since the conquest of England by William I, who set a
precedent by leaving his French holdings to his eldest son, Robert,
and his English holdings to his second son, William II. English
dominion of French territories reached a high point under Henry II,
but from the 13th century, France began to be successful in restoring
French sovereignty to French lands, first during the reign of John,
who managed to lose Normandy, and then with the division of the two
aristocracies from 1244 with the Decree of the Two Masters." The reign
of Edward II was a troubled one, she continues. He married a French
princess, Isabelle, daughter of Phillip IV, who later plotted to
overthrow him, leading an invasion of England in 1326. Edward was
executed, but revenged by his son Edward III, who declared himself
King of France in 1338 after the death of Phillip IV. This was the
beginning of the Hundred Years War
(http://www/siue.edu/CHAUCER/14thcent.html). Richard II assumed the
English throne at the age of 10 in 1377. He was 14 years old at the
outbreak of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.

A prior but related historical event worth noting from this time was
the outbreak of the plague in 1348-49, which killed more than
one-third of the population of England. The population in England
during the 14th century fell to about two million. One effect of the
Black Death, the reduction of the number of laborers in England, led
to conflict between the English peasantry and artisans against their
feudal bonds, since the need for laborers meant that they could sell
their labor for a higher price. Laws were passed which were intended
to restrict the movement of laborers and to confine them to their
traditional feudal estates. The resulting rebellion is known to
English history as the Peasant Revolt of 1381. The British historians
Rodney Hilton and V.J. Kiernan, among others, have researched this
period extensively in the 20th century, and they have concluded that
the lower-level clergy were influential in leading the revolt of day
laborers and landless peasants. Jane Zatta's website tells the story
of one of the leaders, Wat Tyler: "The Rebellion of 1381 began in
Southwest Essex when a tax commissioner was driven from a village. The
revolt's most effective leader was Wat Tyler, who led the commoners to
Canterbury where the Archbishop was executed and judicial records
burned. The commoners occupied London and requested a meeting with the
king, who granted collective charters of pardon and freedom from
serfdom.... On June 14 and 15 the so-called Anonymous Chronicle speaks
ot 140-160 Flemish textile workers killed." It should be noted that
the Anonymous Chronicle is written in Anglo-Norman French, and the
other chronicle which tells the history of this event was written in
continental French by Jean Froissart. There is no account of this
revolt in the English that was spoken by the commoners, and we are
reminded by this fact that French and Latin represented the social and
political world view of the educated and ruling classes at the end of
the 14th century. There is no mention of the Peasants' Revolt in the
works of Chaucer. John Gower wrote about it in Latin in a poem called
Vox Clamatis, and the hero of William Langland's Piers Plowman, a
fictional character, is named in court documents as one of the leaders
of the revolt.

II. Social and Political Structure of the Society

We are reminded by these details of the distinction between gentle and
common birth in the Middle Ages, the organization of an agrarian
society on feudal estates, and the use of indenture and other forms of
bondage to manage the laboring people. The lords and ladies of the
court (Chaucer's audience), the institution of the church which
crossed all social levels, and work on the land as well as among
emerging groups of artisans in the towns constituted the basic social
structure in addition to a military caste of knights who were
mercenaries that swore fealty (loyalty) to their lord and who were
rewarded with lands and other forms of property for their warfare. War
in the Middle Ages was waged by the aristocracy for lands. At the end
of this period we begin to see another form of wealth develop from the
buying and selling of manufactured goods. This new form of wealth
develops in the towns, and 250 years later the conflict between their
interests and the hereditary landed estates will lead to the deposing
of Charles I.

Ludmila Petrochenko writes in her Introduction to the History of
English Literature that the Peasant's Revolt in 1381 "was decisive in
the breakdown of the feudal system: by the end of the Middle Ages the
great landlords of Norman and French origin had almost disappeared and
a new class, the yeoman, or farmers, had become the backbone of
English society." She adds that "English craftsmen, merchants, had
also assumed new powers and demanded new rights." Who were these
craftsmen and merchants? Manufacturing in late medieval society was
contained within the guild system, and organized through the hierarchy
of apprentices, journeymen and masters. To have a trade it was
necessary to have been an apprentice; once apprenticeship had been
completed (normally after seven years) an apprentice could expect his
master to register him as a full guild member, with the freedom to
practice trade as an independent journeyman. Knowledge of the trade
was part of the mystery of the guild, and guild boundaries were
strictly enforced. Guild inspectors would check not only the quality
of the goods produced but also adherence to proper employment
societies for the rising trades. It is impossible to imagine the
Middle Ages without including this element of the society which
developed in the towns.

III. Dialects of the Period

The decline of Old English is completed by the middle of the 13th
century. Since the two status languages were French and Latin (French
because of the social prestige of the aristocracy, and Latin because
it was the language of religion and education), Old English ceased to
be used in any documents. But this fact does not mean that one
language was substituted for another after the Norman conquest. The
12th century especially was an age of exceptionally rapid linguistic
change. One way of stating what happened is that "greater freedom of
intercommunication assisted the southward diffusion of those
grammatical simplifications that had been developed in the northern
dialect. The use of the French language among large classes of the
population may also have tended to accelerate the movement towards
disuse of inflectional endings." (Cambridge History of English). For
example, the use of the preposition "of" instead of the genitive
inflection most likely is due to the imitation of French. But the
influence of French on English grammar is far less than the many and
profound traces left in the English vocabulary. The great differences
between the grammar of Old English and that of Chaucer's time could be
attributed to internal causes, helped by the influence of Scandinavian
settlements in the north. How did grammatical simplification develop
in the northern dialect? According to a recent study, "if we follow
modern sociolinguistic approaches to the relationship between language
change and second-language acquisition, we are led to suggest that the
simplification is the result of second-language learning of English by
the Norse invaders of the 9th to the 11th centuries. One feature of
imperfect learning is the imperfect acquisition of inflectional
endings; and the northern Middle English endings seem to have
originated this way." Most important of all, as you may remember from
an earlier lecture, the strong stress on the root morpheme--found in
English in the first or second syllable of a word--may have strongly
contributed to the dropping of word endings and their grammatical
functions.

As for a picture of the language dialects of this period, we can use
Chaucer to get a sense of the distribution of regional dialects: The
clerks in the Reeve's Tale are from the Northern Dialect Area (north
of the river Humber, which divided the Northern from the East Midland
dialect area). Chaucer himself is from London on the Thames, which
divided the Kentish and the East Midlands dialect areas. The Parson
says he is from the South (south of the Thames river). Basically, the
dialectal division which existed in Old English was preserved in later
periods, and page 91 of our textbook shows this map. N.F. Blake in his
History of the English Language tells us this: "The extant Anglo-Saxon
documents allow us to outline only four major dialect areas: West
Saxon, Kentish, Mercian and Northumbrian. After the Conquest this
remains the basic division, but the individual dialects can often be
broken down into subdivisions. The dialects in this period are now
referred to by their geographical position in England rather than by
the tribal or shire names used for Old English varieties. The
southeastern dialect corresponds to Kentish in Old English and retains
a distinctive character. The southeastern dialect includes more than
what is the modern county of Kent, for it embraces parts of Sussex and
Surrey and had some influence on the speech of London. The
southwestern variety corresponds to the West Saxon dialect and
stretches from Surrey westwards through the counties bordering the
channel, and northwards towards a line from the Thames to the
Severn. The number of texts from this dialect is limited. The Midlands
variety corresponds to the Mercian dialect, but in Middle English
there is a crucial division between the eastern and western halves of
this area. The division between the eastern and western areas follows
the line of the Danelaw. These two halves of the Midlands dialect area
can each be further subdivided into a northern and southern form to
give four Midlands varieties: southwest, northwest, southeast and
northeast. Many texts come from the Midlands area and the eastern
variety increases in importance as this period continues. The northern
variety corresponds to the Northumbrian dialect in Old English. This
area steretches northwards from Yorkshire and Lancashire." A region
that Blake says can harldy be traced dialectally in the Old English
period is East Anglia. He does not explain why, but it may be due to
the great number of texts produced in this area and the mixture of
dialects in the copying of texts in scribal production.

Petrochenko writes that "the development of trade, the growth of towns
with a mixed population favored the intermixture of the regional
dialects." In addition to this, we should remember the complexity of
the making of manuscripts, since the texts which came down from this
period were copied by scribes. It is important to note that the texts
as we have them represent a mixture of grammar, pronunciation and
vocabulary of different dialects. Also, vernacular writers, especially
poets, often used words and forms from dialects other than their own
for expressive purposes. Thus, there are few writings of this period
that can be regarded as unmixed representatives of any single
dialect. But we will name some titles of literary works and the
dialects they may be said to have written in: West Midlands is the
language of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and Piers Plowman;
Southeast Midlands is the language of the region around London, the
dialect of Chaucer, and the ancestor of modern standard English;
Northern English is the speech of the students in the Reeve's Tale,
and another literary work distinguished for its dialectal features is
the Ormulum by Ormulus, whose author had a Scandinavian name and whose
work is full of Danish words, some of which survive in modern rural
dialects. Finally, the Ayenbite of Inwit is written in Kentish
dialect. In addition to these regional dialects, we must also take
London into account. This city grew quickly in this period and
attracted a large number of immigrants from counties to the north and
east. At first immigration was strongest from East Anglia, but during
the 14th century it appears that is was the East Midlands which became
the major source of new settlers in London. As a result of this
immigration the dominant dialect in London changed from a more
southern variety to become a Midland type. This is important since it
is from the London area that the next standard emerges.

IV Summary of the Literature of the Period

The Writing Lesson of 1381. "The topoi of woman's incoherence" or
"Woman as Riot." As if the Wife of Bath could vitiate the discourse
within which she is powerless and illegitimate. Vitiate: to violate
the chastity, contaminate, pollute, to make air impure, to render
ineffective to destroy the force. But break might also be used in the
sense of to vent, as in breaking one's mind--literally, an utterer of
strife or debate (even without giving it any thought). Francoise: "A
Baron? What Baron? Where's the Baron?!" The Baron: "It is far more
difficult to disfigure a great work of art than it is to make one."
Transpose lls. 23-46 from "East Coker," Zukofsky's notation in "A"-23,
Pound (The Spirit of Romance--Langland left off of Pound's list),
William Morris (A Dream of John Ball), Robert Southey's Wat Tyler and
Byron's excoriation of the author's political reversal re the same,
John Clare's The Parish (a decayed allegory), the Cade episode in
Shakespeare, Florimel's unnannounced arrival at the hut and the
impossiblity for the Peasant to pronounce his love (Book III, Faerie
Queen), "Wynner and Wastour," "Perce the Plowman's Crede," "The
Plowman's Tale" appended to the Canterbury Tales, Usk's Testament of
Love, Chaucer, Gower, Lydgate, et al. Walsingham: "It was especially
dangerous if an inkpot were to be found at one's elbow." Lord Berner's
translation of Froissart (the first volume having the chapters on the
Peasants' Revolt) appeared "at the high commandment of his most
redoubted sovereign Lord King Henry the VIII, King of England and
France, high defender of the Christian faith, etc." The translation is
contemporary with the rebellion in Germany Engels will write about in
1850. The editor of the Froissart notes that Lord Berner's book was
second only in popularity to Malory's Morte d'Arthur. (The full text
of Engels' Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith became known only
in 1968 when it was found by a Swiss scholar in the archives of
Joachim Martens together with the draft rules and circular for the
First Congress). It was a question of chronology, now that I saw it
only from aside, and seeing no other possible obstacle than the basic
fact that I had a body, hands which were not my own immense and
belligerent forms. Tonight a romp, rolling from side to side, at the
end of an item in the print-haze. Pages that possess the immediacy
that might be expected of reports written a few days or even hours
after the events they describe. Writing that has thoroughly
materialized and socialized the field of the Imagination's
activity. An allegory charged with a multitude of overlapping schemes,
concentric circles of reference, instinctive contraventions. Austere
profanations and as material designated and adapted enduring theft,
wrenched linkages, inconstant token--and make of them messengers. The
conditions that gave rise to the life we lived are gone.

I've seldom read sentences as poorly written as, ""In my performances =
the communic-action flux is
assumed as act/sign, introducing the necessity of a new semiotic to =
describe
the process." =20

What's bad about the sentence is that it makes absolutely no sense.  Ask =
yourself these:  "what the hell is a communic-action flux?  And if you =
can answer that using words of fewer than three syllables, then, why the =
hell aren't those words in the sentence to begin with? =20

And when you have answered that question, try linking the answer to =
"semiotic" and see it the thought makes sense.  It doesn't for me.  I =
read the entire thought as a kind of academic doubletalk. =20

Ok, somebody, (Caterina Davino) performs her poetry.  Ok, her =
performances are both visual and verbal (or at least I get the =
impression they are from your question).  And, ok, she wonders if what =
she's done will be acceptable to her peers on both sensual  levels. =20

WHat else is there?

  I'm helping Caterina Davinio with her English on a paper she's writing =
and
  came across this sentence "In my performances the communic-action flux =
is
  assumed as act/sign, introducing the necessity of a new semiotic to =
describe
  the process."  This seems to suggest that in Italian, at least, a
  communication action (or poem, etc) as a whole can be considered a
  "semiotic".  It also makes me wonder if a visual poemwould be =
considered two
  joined semiotics and a visual/animated/text work would be three?
  thoughts appreciated.

Hi All,
I teach poetry in public schools and this summer I will be teaching poetry
to 2nd graders in East Palo Alto
(Ca) with a program called  " I Have a Dream. "  A large percentage of my
students are Pacific Islanders. I would love to find a book of poems and/or
stories representative of their culture. I'm having a hard time finding
anything. I'm using several other books from Children's Book Press in San
Francisco. In the recent past something came up here on the list serve about
an anthology of  pidgin language poets/ writers of the Hawaiian Islands/
Samoa. Perhaps, someone can help me....

"What Appears to Be a Yacht in the Distance: An Interview with Kent Johnson"

By way of celebrating the release of perhaps one of the most bizarre books
I've seen in the last several years, Skanky Possum, publisher of the work,
has just posted the above-mentioned interview to its website.

In the interview, conducted under bright high windows in the spacious study
of his windswept Illinois home, Kent Johnson (co-author -- with respected
Greek poet Alexandra Papaditsas -- of the book in question, THE MISERIES OF
POETRY: TRADUCTIONS FROM THE GREEK) is asked questions that cut to the core
concerns many in the poetry world have about the Elusive Poet, prolific
editor, and controversial executor "Knet" Johnson and his relation not only
to the texts that surround him but to the beautiful and brilliant Greek
recluse Alexandra Papaditsas and her disturbing malady.

THE MISERIES OF POETRY: TRADUCTIONS FROM THE GREEK, by Kent Johnson and
Alexandra Papaditsas,

Hi all,

For a music project that's been on hold until recently for a while, I
need recommendations of anthologies of American poetry from about
1910-1940 that include the MOST standard stuff. It doesn't have to
include any "innovative" work, though it won't matter if it does.

Thanks in advance.

Good Day

What it is, that the sunlight falls or shoots, that ladders are an
integrated architecture of form and space, function and engineering, and
that we've made the canyon grand. All over Calgary, the people are talking
and apparently the difference is spreading which is a little different than
has spread. Not at all like an epidemic. These words arrive or are left or
maybe are just given over and drop like throwing pine cones into a bucket.
Is it now full? Or was it empty? That these words cling to the line directly
above, desperate to satellite, or that they will stop at exactly the point I
intend and never seem fragile or perched to fall. The legacy of the blank
space, words, that letters are a capital idea and so is ice cream. 31
flavours and 26 figures. If I put you in, then it is spelled wrong, or at
least unamerican. Oh, what I meant to say was that you're in the shower and
I'm listening to that new CD on the computer. But I really have to go and
open the window, maybe repaint the frames, clean the panes, let some of this
warm weather into our basement.

has either the one or the other, a disaster, back to modernity and
classical or medieval analyses of perception and meaning - the filter is
constructed through the protocols and dispersions - the dispersions are
already filtered - both proceed as if there's a source or origin - it's
the source or origin that's identified as thinking and moving in the world
- it's the source or origin that gives rise to culture - that tends
towards an inconceivable and inauthentic absolute - that tends towards
this absolute with its inherent violence -

Laura--you might try Bamboo Ridge's anthology, _Growing Up Local_,
about growing up in Hawai`i; would include work by writers of various
ethnicities.  And Eric Chock's _Small Kid Time_ is a good book about
teaching poetry writing to children (also Bamboo Ridge).    I think
Bess Press has a number of children-oriented books out of Hawai`i.  And
there are collections of Hawaiian mythology that are appropriate for
elementary school children, as well.  You might contact Ron Cox at
native Books (coxr@hawaii.edu); he's a font of information on the
subject.

Good luck!

aloha, Susan

Introducing a Major New Piece: "PAX"

"Pax" is a lesser apocalypse that began to unveil itself one stormy spring =
day near Dallas when someone closed the terminal and the guns came out. It'=
s about flying and falling, truth and desire, nakedness, terror, and the =
home land. While some may find these themes all too American, they are as =
Chekhov might have said originally Russian: recall what happened to those =
cosmonauts who took off from the USSR and landed in the CIS, displaced by =
a trick of history, discovering (as we all must) that we travel through =
time as well as space. It's become a common experience these days, this =
journey to another world, this never coming home. Especially when the guns =
come out.



Stuart Moulthrop is Professor of Information Arts and Technologies at the =
University of Baltimore.  His previous electronic works include Victory =
Garden (1991), "Hegirascope" (1995), and "Reagan Library" (1999). He is an =
emeritus editor of the journal Postmodern Culture and was a founding =

I remarked recently to some grad students how uncannily the faces of
Gertrude Stein and G W Bush resemble each other. They did not believe me
until I sent them to this URL: http://www.bartleby.com/people/Stein-Ge.html

if you gently wiggle your mouse on browser's scroll bar such that her face
goes up and down up and down it looks like she is laughing at evil doers

Even if it is or does not become true, the Democratic Party - yet, it
appears, in absence of the Candidate -  has come up with a great way to
raise money. We got a call yesterday with the rumor-news that Justice
O'Connor will announce her retirement within the year and the current
President will nominate John Ashcroft to replace her. The resistance is
already forming.

If you want to see a spontaneous set of physical tremors among your friends,
share this well-might-be-true rumor. Talk about tilting the so-called
balance of the court. Amazing. The News practically ruined the beautiful
after-glow of a Berkeley Hertz Hall concert last night of a beautiful series
of John Adams and Ingram Marshall pieces, conducted and played with other
musicians by the composers themselves.

 When is somebody(ies) going to get this Administration on a "corked bat" or
"cooked books" and make it stick.  (Blair, on the other hand, now looks like
a bull going slowly down - check in London's Independent).

Well City Lights Bookshop is 50 years old this month and still going strong
and the City is closing down Columbus this afternoon in celebration. Some
things do survive the interpretation of the Constitution.  & I will be
there.

Jeez, I hope Bush is stupid enough to do this. We can assume that whoever
retires a right-winger will be nominated as replacement, but usually these
battles aren't even noticed by most voters, unless there's a pubic hair in
the coke. If Ashcroft's the nominee it becomes a massive, very public
debate about the administration's human rights record and its sham defense
against terrorism. And I don't think the nomination could possibly survive
the process--there'd be nothing in it for the Dems to persuade them to cave.

Every account I've read about the looting of the Baghdad museum,
including petitions I've seen from archeological orgs have been fixated
on the image that 170,000 pieces were removed.  Now suddenly the media
is saying the actual number of significant artifacts missing is in the
tens.  Did someone just originally concoct a fanciful story?  Welcome
to the age of the haze of the NYTs freefall school of reporting.

Yes, if the treasures have been found then great, but how can this
miraculous discovery be any more believable than that other, flipside news
of their apocalyptic destruction?

This waffling between extremes is so rhetorically suspect: no matter if NYTs
or another--all are sounding way too oracular, and it serves political
agendas remarkably well.  The same oracular confusions seem to have been the
case--and to have helped the case of aggressive neo-cons (for they are cons,
no?) and Bushies to the max--over the *crisis* of those elusive WMDs.  You
know, those elusive mortifyingly fearful things that CNN re-images &
re-proves daily as *Found! At Last!*

The article says that 33 major works, and 2000 minor works, whatever that
means, are missing. Can you imagine the outcry if 33 major works were
missing from the Smithsonian, or the Metropolitan! And what the truth
actually is, as usual, we don't know.

The Rosenberg execution - whether or not he was guilty  - I remember as a
bullet and warning to the heart of the left. It was quite momentarily
successful attempt to savage the progressive language of the left that
emerged and found broad public currency in the thirties - unions, worker
protections, right and access to higher education - stuff that was really a=
t
odds with the Hearst banana republic world view of how much the 'comman man=
'
should be entitled.  The execution, as Mark suggests, was also a horrifying
anti-Semitic message aimed at a strong portion of the socialist leadership
that had led the charge against corporate goon and racist control of the
working place and political landscape. One way to read Ginsberg's Howl is a=

a vent and articulation of the pain and wound that was inflicted. It was no=

until the Civil Rights movement  in the late fifties that progressives were
able to begin to re-emerge in struggle - one in which Jews again played a
very strong and shared role in the leadership.

Instead of Hearst we now have Murdoch and the thugs - with all their
religious decorations.  Heah, without contraries - as Blake pronounces - no
progression. But wow, do we need or deserve this much regression!!??

The City Lights celebration had delightful moments - Lawrence Ferlinghetti
was radiant and as politically tuned as ever. The young who read - James
Katz(?) and David Eggers - were fresh, alive, publicly and politically
engaged and heartening. Before maybe 500 people standing out on Columbus Av=

Kirby - you shouldn't have to build an argument o prove a point as there is
good 'scientific' evidence for the preconscious - it's past speculation.
You might want to look at this 'monster' compilation:  _Repression and
Dissociation: Implications for Personality Theory, Psychopathology and
Health -- by Jerome L. Singer 1995
You can skip the heavy science and it should give you some idea of the
research hat has been happening and now being conducted.  It'll also give
you a grounding in psychology as opposed to the airy Freudians and
Lacanians. {there I go again, I guess]

The role of the face in expressing emotions - do we have an emotion and then
make a face expressing it or do we have on a face and then feel the
emotion - is hotly debated and has been for years.  I hink I posted one side
of this recently.

Keep up the good work - it's pretty obvious that real psychology is not
studied in Humanities programs.

Another area that gets short schrift is the phenomenology of the body as
everyone that talks about it knows the big old names but can't find any new
research.

Review of Google Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips and Tools


Tara Calishain and Rael Dornfest, O'Reilly, 2003, $24.95, 330 pp.

I've been using Google Hacks for creative work for the past few weeks, and
have found the book of tremendous value. There are of course hegemonic
issues surrounding Google; it's by far the most popular search engine on
the Web. But it's also the only search engine that has released its API,
defined as "'Application Programming Interface,' a doorway for
programmatic access to a particular resource or application, in this case,
the Google index." In other words, the API provides a remarkably supple
method for embedding Google queries in a program (mostly Perl here), which
makes this search engine eminently useful for creative and/or database
work. The book includes a large number of programs taking advantage of the
API; they're also available at the O'Reilly site for downloading. Examples
are given in Java, PHP, Perl, Python, etc.

One difficulty which may be more than minor - many programs use a
SOAP::Lite Perl module. This is easy to download for ActivePerl for
Windows; on one of my linux laptops (running RedHat 7+), it wouldn't
install at all, but downloaded Perl 5.8.0 which didn't help. On another
laptop with a later RedHat, it went in fairly easily.

Once you have the module installed, most of the programs run without any
difficulty. They allow you to do such things as summarize results by
domain, set up automated repeat searches, "Meander Your Google
Neighborhood" and so forth. They also allow any number of search results -
this is changed by increasing the looping which is set for 3 (thirty
results). I did a search for "internet" - returning the domain statistics
- using the first 1000 entries; it only took a minute or two.

As an artist, I tend to see Google as a universal sememe or memory house
that attempts to gather all human knowledge. Some of my recent work
operates "upon" this sememe, locating categories, paths, and convolutions.
The programs in Google Hacks (and their modifications) give the user
tremendous control over these. I will now be using the same to look at the
Google groups archiving. (The book not only covers Google Groups, but the
Directory, Images, News, Catalogs, Labs, and Froogle.)

The last section of the book is written from the "Webmaster Side" of
things and is quite useful for indexing/configuring your own webpages.
And the book as a whole is useful for anyone using search engines in
general - its range extends far beyond "How do I look up X?" - into issues
that, at least for me, bear on the organization and epistemology of
knowledge itself.

I wanted to write this review for a number of reasons. Tara Calishain is
in my Being On Line book, and I've subscribed for a long time to her
ResearchBuzz newsletter. Google itself has allowed me to explore certain
aspects of my textual/literary practice, and has been invaluable for my
interests in both ancient languages (Sumerian, Assyrian for example) and
ecology (behavior of the yellow-headed blackbird for example). I've always
admired the surface simplicity of the site; on the other hand, I'm not
blind to its political economy and the vast areas of the Net that aren't
indexed (as well as those areas indexed "against their will").

But above all, this book oddly reads as a commentary for the searching
many of us do in many ways - and in my case, the artistic and cultural
rewards gained by using it are enormous. I'd suggest for everyone to give
it a try (as well as learning a bit of Perl and programming - although
neither is necessary to use it) - at least check it out through the
O'Reilly site.

A final note - a plug for O'Reilly in general. If you haven't explored
their publications, you're missing what are probably the most intelligent
computer-oriented books around. And oddly enough, they don't tend to go
out of date!

When Some Lives Are Worth More than Others

by Naomi Klein > May 21 2003

Jessica Lynch and Rachel Corrie could have passed for sisters. Two all-American blondes, two destinies forever changed in a Middle East war zone. Private Jessica Lynch, the soldier, was born in Palestine, West Virginia. Rachel Corrie, the activist, died in Israeli-occupied Palestine.

Corrie was four years older than 19-year old Lynch. Her body was crushed by an Israeli bulldozer in Gaza seven days before Lynch was taken into Iraqi custody on March 23. Before she went to Iraq, Lynch organized a pen pal program with a local kindergarden. Before Corrie left for Gaza, she organized a pen pal program between kids in her hometown of Olympia, Washington, and children in Rafah.

Lynch went to Iraq as a soldier loyal to her government. In the words of West Virginia Senator Jay Rockefeller, "she approached the prospect of combat with determination rather than fear."

Corrie went to Gaza to oppose the actions of her government. As a U.S. citizen, she believed she had a special responsibility to defend Palestinians against U.S.-built weapons, purchased with U.S. aid to Israel. In letters home, she vividly described how fresh water was being diverted from Gaza to Israeli settlements, how death was more normal than life. "This is what we pay for here," she wrote.

Unlike Lynch, Corrie did not go to Gaza to engage in combat -â€” she went to try to thwart it. Along with her fellow members of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), she believed that the Israeli military's incursions could be slowed by the presence of highly visible "internationals." The killing of Palestinian civilians may have become commonplace, the thinking went, but Israel doesn't want the diplomatic or media scandals that would come if it killed a U.S. college student.

In a way, Corrie was harnessing the very thing that she disliked most about her country â€” the belief that American lives are worth more than any others - and trying to use it to save a few Palestinian homes from demolition.

Believing her fluorescent orange jacket would serve as armor, that her bullhorn could repel bullets, Corrie stood in front of bulldozers, slept beside water wells, and escorted children to school. If suicide bombers turn their bodies into weapons of death, Corrie turned hers into the opposite: a weapon of life, a "human shield."

When that Israeli bulldozer driver looked at Corrie's orange jacket and pressed the accelerator, her strategy failed. It turns out that the lives of some U.S. citizens - even beautiful, young, white women â€” are valued more than others. And nothing demonstrates this more starkly than the opposing responses to Rachel Corrie and Private Jessica Lynch.

When the Pentagon announced Lynch's successful rescue, she became an overnight hero, complete with "America loves Jessica" fridge magnets, stickers, t-shirts, mugs, country songs, and an NBC made-for-TV movie. According to White House spokesman Ari Fleisher, President George W. Bush was "full of joy for Jessica Lynch." Lynch's rescue, we were told, was a testament to a core American value: as Senator Rockefeller put it in a speech to the Senate, "We take care of our people."

Do they? Corrie's death, which made the papers for two days and then virtually disappeared, has met with almost total official silence, despite the fact that eye-witnesses claim it was a deliberate act. President Bush has said nothing about a U.S. citizen killed by a U.S. made bulldozer bought with U.S. tax dollars. A U.S. congressional resolution demanding an independent inquiry into Corrie's death has been buried in committee, leaving the Israeli military's investigation - which conveniently cleared itself of any wrong doing as the only official probe.

The ISM says that this non-response has sent a clear, and dangerous, signal. According to Olivia Jackson, a 25-year-old British citizen still in Rafah, "after Rachel was killed, [the Israeli military] waited for the response from the American government and the response was pathetic. They have realized that they can get away with it and it has encouraged them to keep on going."

First there was Brian Avery, a 24-year-old citizen shot in the face on April 5. Then Tom Hurndall, a British ISM activist shot in the head and left brain dead on April 11. Next was James Miller, the British cameraman shot dead while wearing a vest that said "TV." In all of these cases, eye-witnesses say the shooters were Israeli soldiers.

There is something else that Jessica Lynch and Rachel Corrie have in common: both of their stories have been distorted by a military for its own purposes. According to the official story, Lynch was captured in a bloody gun battle, mistreated by sadistic Iraqi doctors, then rescued in another storm of bullets by heroic Navy SEALs. In the past weeks, another version has emerged. The doctors that treated Lynch found no evidence of battle wounds, and donated their own blood to save her life. Most embarrassing of all, witnesses have told the BBC that those daring Navy SEALs already knew there were no Iraqi fighters left in the area when they stormed the hospital.

But while Lynch's story has been distorted to make its protagonists appear more heroic, Corrie's story has been posthumously twisted to make her, and her fellow ISM activists, appear sinister.

For months, the Israeli military had been looking for an excuse to get rid of the ISM "troublemakers." It found it in Asif Mohammed Hanif and Omar Khan Sharif , the two British suicide bombers. It turns out that they had attended a memorial to Rachel Corrie in Rafah, a fact the Israeli military has seized on to link the ISM to terrorism. Members of ISM point out that the memorial was open to the public, and that they knew nothing of the British visitors' intentions. As an organization, the ISM is explicitly opposed to the targeting of civilians, whether by Israeli bulldozers or Palestinian bombers. Furthermore, many ISMers believe that their work may reduce terrorist incidents by demonstrating that there are ways to resist occupation other than the nihilistic revenge offered by suicide bombing.

No matter. In the past two weeks, half a dozen ISM activists have been arrested, several deported, and the organization's offices have been raided. The crack down is now spreading to all "internationals," meaning there are fewer and fewer people in the occupied territories to either witness the ongoing abuses or assist the victims. On Monday, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process told the Security Council that dozens of UN aid workers had been prevented from getting in and out of Gaza, calling it a violation of "Israel's international humanitarian law obligations."

On June 5 there will be an international day of action for Palestinian rights. One of the key demands is for the UN to send an international monitoring force into the occupied territories. Until that happens, many are determined to continue Corrie's work, despite the risks. Over forty students at her former college, Evergreen State in Olympia, have already signed up to go to Gaza with the ISM this summer.

So who is a hero? During the attack on Iraq, some of Corrie1s friends emailed her picture to MSNBC asking that it be included on the station's "wall of heroes," along with Jessica Lynch. The network didn't comply, but Corrie is being honoured in other ways. Her family has received more than 10,000 letters of support, communities across the country have organized powerful memorials, and children all over the occupied territories are being named Rachel.

It's not a made-for-TV kind of tribute, but perhaps that's for the best.

Tom Bell, and others interested in the language thread --

I got a great post from someone who wrote about yoga and the origins of language
via Indian philosophers working on Derrida.  It sounded amazing, but maybe he
made a mistake and posted it to me privately.

I'm going to keep working on Polanyi for a while.  Now P. writes that he wants
to separate people and machines, saying that people are sentient and machines
aren't.  This line has been under tremendous stress for a long time with Donna
Harraway's Cyborgs leading the charge, I guess.  But there is still a difference
between a machine and a sentient being, I think.  Once a pig dies, you can't
make it live again.  Any machine can be fixed.  For instance, you have a fan
that won't work, you squirt WD-40 in the back, and it will go again.  You can
fix refrigerators, and cars, etc., after they've "died."  Pigs and birds have
something in them that once it goes, it's gone.  You can't bring it back.

People, too.  Once a baby dies, there's no bringing it back.  There's nothing to
fix!  Or whatever it is, you have to fix it instantly.  Machines you can let sit
around in the garage for a couple of months before you get around to repairing
them.

And I think the mechanistic view of language that lang po implies is based on
the idea that people are machine-like.  I think this is the implication that
comes out of Saussure -- the language is neat and arrangeable and somehow
machine-like.

Is this right?  Just a hunch.

Reading August Highline's poetry which is made up of computer coordinates and
rule-making is a new kind of paradigm about poetry that negates the older
traditional view that people are sentient souls who operate to a certain extent
outside of causal nature.  We are not like minerals or chemicals but have free
will.  This is of course under tremendous attack.  In Marxism you get this very
weird idea that people are both subject to some kind of universal history that
comes out of Hegel, and also that they should try to do something to help this
inexorable struggle of the classes.  Is there free will in Marx?  I think not
because it turns people into subjects of science.

Something else is going on in religious thinkers like Kant.  Kant assumes that
we have free will (some, and certainly not perfect) and that we can therefore
intervene, in a moral sense, and that this is in fact our responsibility.  We
are NOT programmed.  We are not only the only animal capable of good, but the
only animal capable of evil -- this seems to be lost when a computer program
does the thinking.

Highland's work is therefore a pretty big problem.

Whatever it is that dies in a baby or in a bird that can't be fixed is beyond
reach of our current understanding.  At least in positivist terms, it can't be
put.  Does it mean therefore that it isn't there?  Polanyi is arguing no, that
it's there.  So are these Indian philosophers.  This mechanical framework that
you get after the industrial revolution with the implication that people are
just like machines -- or practically that they are just upright zippers -- is
being held out against by a lot of folks.  This might even be a point of
commonality between overly zealous Christians, overly zealous Muslims, and
overly zealous Jews.  But when people lose their sense of humor they become like
robots.

And I've decided to stay away from that abyss of robotic ill will, because I
don't want to lose my sense of humor, either.  What is a sense of humor, anyway,
and can it be "lost"?

Tom Bell, can you explain what you mean by real psychology, versus the false
stuff?  Freud it's true has a mechanical model of the mind in the book on jokes,
for instance -- he sees us along the lines of hydraulic machines.  Do you have a
better model in mind?  I don't know anything about these theorists you've
mentioned.  The Indian philosophers who are working on Derrida and Yoga are in a
book edited by a guy named Coward.

I think the mechanical versus the soul model has huge implications for poetry
and it bears on theological questions, etc. etc.  It's too big for any one
person to think about, and is probably a matter of faith or the lack thereof,
finally, but the implications of this are kind of endless, no?

Sorry for the slip of the key.

Kirby, I didn't mean to imply Freud was not real or not a great system
builder.  He's obviously important.  What I meant to say is that he and
Lacan are sytem builders who did not necessarily have a lot of contact with
real clients.  I think most therapists do not keep a synopsis of Freud, for
example, bu the side of the couch and ask themselves what would Freud have
done?  Kristeva is an exception but for the most part these 'theories' are
up in the closet but at the same time philosophers and lit people take them
as straw men when talking about psychology.  As far as therapy goes the
likely arguments are to be found on such subjects as medicine or not (the
best and swer seem to be both) and short-term brief therapy vs. ananlysis of
many stripes.

The other problem with thee theories is that neither F or L take into
account the large amount of research that has been done in psychology and
neuropsychology (F did come too soon).  Damasio and Modell take some of this
into account.

Even though it is summer for many it's too bad we seem to have scared off

Hello Laura,
You could try something by the Polynesian writer Sia
Figiel - especially her early poem "The Centre"- 1995
(It was published in "The UTS Review" from the
University of Technology in Sydney, Australia) She has
at least two books published & is represented in
anthologies. She is from Samoa.

Kirby,

That weird experiment reminds me of a quote from Harold G. Coward in The
Sphota Theory of Language: "Because the whole sentence meaning is inherently
present in the mind of each person, it is quite possible for the prathiba of
the sphota to be grasped by the listener even before the whole sentence has
been uttered." The experiment certainly tries to force this in a bizarre
way, especially since it focuses only on the syllable--and it seems blithely
to assume that people can't sense the next thing coming without some outside
Pavlovian intervention ("Oh, ye of little faith," &c.). But everyone knows
somebody annoyingly good at finishing one's sentences (especially annoying
if accurate!)--and not just the couple married for 50 years who need only
grunt to understand each other, but even 'perfect' strangers. A sort of
synchronicity . . .

So what about the implications of these phenomena for poetics? Klunky rhyme
seems like the weird experiment, and similarly makes the reader flinch. I'd
like to think that 'my' reader would not so much fail to anticipate
what would come next in a poem, but perhaps find some delight in discovering
that he or she had not only not anticipated it, but had not even tried (cf.
Negative Capability). Some Langpos and their scions, it seems, try to
enforce such an outcome by antisemantic means somtimes as draconian as the
shock experiment you describe. I'd prefer the unanticipated more embedded
within the (not necessarily quotidian but) narrative sense, rather than as a
function of the logos interruptus.

What do you/y'all think?

All psychologists are not Pavlovians or Skinnerians or Freudians or
Lacanians but from the posts I've seen here we seem to be victims of our own
colonizing as in Harry Polinhorn's preface to _Across the Line/Al otro lado
: "What did the colonizing authorities in Mexico's large interior cities
really know of this far-flung outreach [Baja california] except what their
own baroque imaginations figured for them (p. 9)" Pressing the analogy here
it might by that language as all theorists are colonizing what is beyond
language.

Barchelard does a lot of equivocating on the issue, but does have this to
say: "But all these images...are _dynamic_ images rather than substantial
ones.  Our firebirds are not images of the substance of fire, but rather
images of speed.  Firbirds are _flashes of fire." _Fragments of a Poetics of
Fire.

community organizers to explore the potential of performance for personal,
organizational and social-cultural change. Over forty sessions showcased
innovative practice and scholarship and provided a rich context for learning
and performing together. (You can read about it at
www.performingtheworld.org.)

Since then, performance-based practice and theory have grown in recognition
and popularity worldwide. Today, there exist hundreds of programs in scores
of countries, disciplines and areas of life that utilize or study
performance as developmental and transformative. In addition to helping the
individuals they reach, such programs speak to the growth of a movement to
reinitiate the relational, the communal, the creative, the developmental
drive of human beings. Performing the World 2 is being convened to support
and expand this international, cross-disciplinary community.

The weekend will feature
. A smorgasbord of performance and improvisation training workshops led by
professional trainers and performers.
. Demonstrations and hands-on exploration of performance approaches to
community development, teaching and learning, therapy, social work and
mental health, medicine, body work and movement, social activism and
politics.
. Performance art and dance from established artists-activists from all over
the globe.
. Explorations of ritual and traditional culture as tools for personal
growth and social change, highlighting projects from Bangladesh, the former
Yugoslavia, South Africa, and various ethnic communities in the US and
Canada.
. An evening Youth Development Festival featuring theatre projects from the
US, South Africa, Germany and Australia.
. A plenary session featuring Susan Jaffe, former principal dancer with the
American Ballet Theater
. A special plenary session where participants get to perform their
responses, reactions and questions to presentations they've been part of!

A sampling of confirmed presentations:

"What's Therapeutic about Philosophy and What's Philosophical about Therapy"
(US and Canada); "Theatre, Improv and Organizational Consulting" (US);
"Traditional Games and Healing" (a working experience with the tribal people
of Bangladesh); "Our Hands"  (Yugoslavia); "Community Empowerment as a

Kirby,

Your post touched on a lot of points currently of interest for me too,
although I suspect we're coming at this from very different angles.

The problem of mind is the problem of the body but with people still
operating in a Cartesian mindset quite gruesome visions of the human
condition are being put forward in art as much as in Hollywood movies. It
would seem that dualisms like mind/body or even brain/body in the arts gives
rise to misguided optimism in people like the Australian artist Stellarc who
proclaim that the human body will become obsolescent, but also manifests
itself in dark the dark fantasies found in  movies like the Matrix or
Bladerunner or even AI. There are of course artists operating on the "other"
side., i.e. the side of the body, like Gins and Arakawa (or vice versa)
whose development of the Architectural Body seems to me an exemplary
response to the embodied mind in the world.

More seriously, studies in computer intelligence are, if Fritjof Capra is to
be believed, coming to an grind because the body and our idea of
"information" (Capra says that "information" is a misnomer, but I honestly
don't know enough about IT to comment the extent of the unfortunate
neologism) has been flawed from the start. -- Quickly, the problem of
information is that in IT information is actually a signal, and nothing to
do with information as we commonly know it, please someone add to this --

But what I can't work out is what attitude to machines and the body is being
expressed in these computer generated texts. They are, dare I say, just
texts; often unreadable, but sometimes mildly entertaining. You say that
these texts are" a new kind of paradigm about poetry that negates the older
traditional view that people are sentient souls who operate to a certain
extent outside of causal nature," though I don't see them negating of this
view at all, but deeply inside it. In fact, technology that has as its base
a dualistic image of humanity simply mechanizes the "spirit" and lets the
body go hang.

Also, are texts such as Highland's or sometimes Sondheim's asking questions
of technology or even foregrounding technology or merely using technology?
Last summer, Jesse Glass created quite a stir by asking a similar question,
I hope my comments don't do the same.

Finally, as far as I know, Freud and Lacan  are something of a joke among
cognitive scientists and people in psychology and I think Tom is absolutely
right to bemoan humanities departments that still teach them as anything
other than in the context of the history of ideas..

Anyhow, thanks for keeping this very interesting thread going..

-Ben

The unemployment rate and mortality rate
evidence my vacancy rate.
Fuck you suckers.  I have no maturity date.
I'm cold as the Bering Strait, like
Herod with hate, wasting all those Iraqi kids--
with million dollar 'mizzels' I turned them to splatter.
Fo' schizzle, bizzel, watch 'em sizzle!
You and I both know I forbid you all to matter.
I'm madder than Henry the Eight,
badder than Alexander the Great.
I am your fate. I am fully prepared to humiliate
everyone from here to the oily capital of Kuwait.
Your mouth is my toilet seat; open wide, dear.
Deceit is what I bring, and what I excrete is right-wing
crap.  I'll bitchslap your ass if you don't make me king.
I got Ashcroft right here to slide in da police state greased with fear.
Bling-bling and extending suffering is what I sing.
So listen up please, 'cause there's nothing to hear.
As you can see I have nothing to hide.
I bring nothing between my white ears for you to demodulate,
what my face formulates is permanently snide.
No need to recriminate me for my efforts to desecrate your ass
through hijacking the separation of church and state
in order to hyperinflate the size of my collection plate.
Hate fate?  Hell, boy, it's all fate and hate is your fate.
I sent 150 people to the chair while Governor to fry
and made sure to laugh each time I watched them die.
Next up? Step up to my Texas Rangers Ballpark plate.
I'll use my landed estate to acquire some armor plate,
lick my dessert plate and depopulate the welfate state
while I defoliate with nukes
all the lands surrounding the Korean Strait.
I'll repopulate the world with
gun-running dope-smuggling terrorist-funding
money-laundering genocide-provoking covert operative spooks.
My utopia is apocalyptic myopia.
After I'm done shitting I'm gonna pee you ya.
Fixed election, passing laws about heaven,
and so many unanswered questions surrounding 9/11.
Blindly lying in wait escaping all public debate.
Somehow I got America tied in a figure of eight.

Me and Dick Cheney, cruisin' state galas,
Suckers wanna play me while we're gobblin up the dollahs?

So be careful who you try to berate,
if it's me you try to execrate as excretory gas.
I'll show all you sucker MCs your fate
by shoving diplomacy and democracy right up your ass.

Bushwhack in da house.
Murder you an' yo spouse.
Bushwhack in da house.
Crush ya all like a mouse.

I think Joel Weishaus and others posting to the list also have or are
struggling with technology rather than succumbing.  Also there is some
history here, for example the Russian futurists (Not the Italians who were
enthralled by machines).  Dmitry Bulatov is putting togeether a book of
contempoaray stuff.  Most of my work deals with my struggles with my body
and the duende attitude I'm tring to attain.

Cybermidrash is a collaboration between Alan Sondheim and Joel Weishaus. The
project begins with correspondence between the two writers that leads to a
page of commentaries concordant with midrash, juxtaposed rabbinic remarks
annotated over the
centuries. http://web.pdx.edu/~pdx00282/temp/title.htm

"The Iraqi central bank, run by the coalition in conjunction with Iraqis,
has begun rolling out huge quantities of 250-dinar notes bearing Saddam
Hussein's face, because Iraqis fear their 10,000-dinar notes are losing much
of their value and may become invalid altogether. It is believed that Saddam
had a great many of the 10,000-dinar notes printed in the final days before
the war and that counterfeit versions abound. The 250-dinar notes are worth
about 25 U.S. cents each." From CNN News on the web.


Well, well, well, this is fun. So much for the photo/viz op dramatics of
"Coalition" forces pulling down statues and any other State image to be
found of Hussein. His image is back and rolling out on the cash. Printed by
our very own Coalition-run Iraqi Central Bank. And this is a CNN story -
that is apparently - as far as I can tell -  no lie. I find this an
absolutely astonishing capitulation to the realities of getting operative a
remnant of whatever is stilled deemed "real" in the Iraqi economy. Can you
imagine, Bechtel and Haliburton will be paying their new employees in money
still carrying the image of Hussein?

Something is really twisted about this picture.

New Poetry in Iraq is going to have a curious job!

And this country?

could someone help me?
i'm thinking about why people write poetry and the word acceptance keeps
coming up.
is anyone aware of any work done on seeking acceptance(or seeking
recognition of ones existence within a culture, ie as an adult, as a
writer, as a woman) as reason to write, or motivation to write.
i'm sure the theorists are plentiful but i'm looking for a really good
quote that encapsulates this concept.

thanks in advance

SEX MACHINE
EYEDRUM ART & MUSIC GALLERY
MARCH 20 - APRIL 17 2004

SEX MACHINE
In March 2004 Eyedrum Art and Music gallery will host SEX MACHINE, an
international show on the most intimate of human extensions.
In previous times (that is, before the modern era, say, about 300 years
ago) the only accoutrements to the sex act may well have been the
fetishistic materials of bondage, and those tools which accompanied the
act of seduction: musical instruments, wine or other chemical enhancers, a
book of poetry perhaps.=A0 No doubt the prolonged application of technique
to sexuality was the=A0prerogative of the nobility and the leisured class.=
=A0
For most people then the accentuation and prolongation of the sex act
would have been most often considered perverse in and of itself, disabling
it from the world of procreation and subsequent nurturing of the family.=A0=
=A0
But now we seem to be entering the epoch of 'bare life' as philosopher
Giorgio Agamben has termed it.=A0 The 'naked life' of the population comes
under increasing scrutiny and control of the sovereign forces of the state
(in the mediated form of the corporate trans-nationals); in fact, CREATING
many aspects of this bare life, at the root of which is the sex act itself
and it's increasing severance from human reproduction in an age of cloning
and recombinant DNA research.=A0
The sex act itself, in its non-metaphorized state, is indeed a simple
mechanical machine, rhythmic and lulling, while strangely excitory, in its
repetitive nature, a repetition which music generally and rock music
particularly have used to its own detourned advantage.=A0 (Perhaps why the
'bare life' of the sex act itself has not been much valued by artists, the
metaphorical and phenomenological 'clothing' of the act seeming to be more
productive of various forms of representation, not to mention seductive
for the artist's own purposes.)=A0
The act itself is now completely permeated with mechanisms of various
kinds: contraceptive 'machines' of various materials (we must include
condoms of various sorts, male and female, as well as contraceptive and
Viagra-type pharmacologies as machinic), the whole apparatus of the
PRODUCTION of sexual desire such as the videos, movies, and games of the
porno industry (probably the only industry which makes money from the net)
and in fact the vaporous intrusions of the net itself into our psyche.
(There are even people doing work in haptic research called Teledildonics
which hopes to sell a part of the population on the dream of virtually
'reaching out and touching someone' in order to stimulate and bring to
fruition the sex act.)=A0 Not to even mention the whole industry of sex
aides such as vibrators, dildos, and so on.

Eyedrum is doing an 'all stripped down' show of sex machines. Lovingly
crafted devices for the practice of, well, if not love, then one of love's
major components.=A0=A0 Unlike Terry=A0 Eagleton's quote that "An instrumen=
tal
rationality, one attentive to the use of object, is at least an
alternative to the fetishism of them," we would like to have our cake and
eat it too -- a fetishized rationality of lubricious (and artistic, which
we think can count for the same thing) intent.
We are looking for workable (or potentially so) sex machines, or plans for
such, or utopias of sex machines, stroking, throbbing, probing, their way
into a brave new alliance between flesh, steel, latex, plastic, and
electricity.  Any interpretation of the sex machine will be considered.

My Eternity


I write ahead of time, that my readers of 2053 will perhaps understand me
and my lack of hatred for everyone who refuses to support me, who stands
by, who closes his or her eyes to the brilliance of a new dawn of writing.
And the readers of 2103 who will finally begin to comprehend, not only my
literatures, but my philosophies of truths or lack of them. And my
stupidity, which is close to that of Stendhal's, as if the future gathers
a promissory note which will never been collected. What is variegated now
will come together in critical coherency. No one can begin in this or any
other present. What will be will be. I will not mention my enemies. They
are legion. They affect me but remain outside my work. They are only of
personal concern. Their names will be forgotten. I will not honor them.
Someone will write my biography - myself, I would be sued. I cannot afford
to tell the truth (in this regard). I tell the truth otherwise. The truth
I tell is what is important in 2053. You may have to look hard for my work
but my only wish is that it is available. And available in 2103. In 2103
it will be understood. My enemies will be long dead. My biography will
include their names. Everyone I know will be long dead. Their descendents
will have forgotten me. My work will stand on its own. My work will be
read in 2203 and 2303. My work will continue to be read.

hey,

"The world can accept me now because there is coming out of _your_
generation somebody they don't like, and therefore they accept me because I
am sufficiently past in having been contemporary so they don't have to
dislike me. So thirty years from now I shall be accepted. And the same thing
will happen again: that is the reason why every generation has the same
thing happen. It will always be the same story, because there is always the
same situation presented. The contemporary thing in art and literature is
the thing which doesn't make enough difference to the people of that
generation so that they can accept of reject it."

this is how gertrude stein deals with the topic (in How Writing is Written)
and you're probably looking for something less abstract and more personal.
still she makes clear that it should be rather hard to be accepted. elswhere
she distinguishes between acceptance and recognition - something like:
nobody needs to be accepted, everybody needs recognition... but don't quote
me or her on this.

so if you're in for the ambivalence of it, stein is definitely a challenge
in her ponderings on contemporariness and master pieces. also e.g. in
Composition as Explanation:

"For a long time everybody refuses and then almost without a pause almost
everybody accepts. In the history of the refused in the arts and literature
the rapidity of the change is always startling. Now the one difficulty with
the _volte-face_ concerning the arts is this. When acceptance comes, by that
acceptance the thing created becomes a classic. It is a natural phenomena a
rather extraordinary natural phenomena that a thing accepted becomes a
classic. And what is the characteristic  quality of a classic. The
characteristic quality of a classic is that it its beautiful. Now of course
it is perfectly true that a more or less first rate work of art is beautiful
but the trouble is that when that first rate work of art becomes a classic
because it is accepted the only thing that is important from then on to the
majority of the acceptors the enormous majority, the most intelligent
majority of the acceptors is that it is so wonderfully beautiful. Of course
it is wonderfully beautiful, only when it is still a thing irritating
annoying stimulating then all quality of beauty is denied to it.
Of course it is beautiful but first all beauty is denied and then all the
beauty of it is accepted. If everyone were not so indolent..."

beware though, you might get hooked.
cheers, hl.

Kevin Killian's enthusiasm for my sequence of poems is a deep pleasure for
me, and quite an honor.

His range is amazing: a poet, novelist, and playwright--he has a
sense of writing as a community, as in his collaborations-- with Leslie
Scalapino, Peter Gizzi, and most recently with Barbara Guest, among others. I
remember the vivacity of a reading he gave at UB; and I heard him again
at the University of Maine, this time he seasoned his reading with a
very funny, improvised shtick. Just as the conference was over he
emailed to everybody a summary and assessment of the conference that
was absolutely brilliant, and got high praise from Marjorie Perloff.
        ...and Kevin is so much younger than I am.
        Who would not be pleased by reaching out beyond one's aged cohorts?
        I am truly grateful.

IMO, give it 2 months, the odd insurrection or two with it's usual dancing
partner, the bloody suppression, and it really will feel like old times.
So, for poetry, it might well be back to grief management.

EARLY NEW ENGLISH

This lecture will review the Early New English period (1475-1660) and
the Modern English Period (17th to 19th century). The development of a
national literary language from a multiplicity of dialects in the
Middle Ages will be our primary concern, with special attention to the
historical background to this development, normalizing tendencies
which contributed to the establishment of both a written and a spoken
standard, the influence of grammars and dictionaries on this process,
word borrowings from other languages (especially the French language),
and finally the geographical expansion of English to the North
American continent, and India and Africa.

1. Historical background

The historical background to the development of English into a
national literary language includes first and most importantly the
transformation of feudal economic and social relations into the early
modern forms of bourgeois relations and the capitalist mode of
production, especially in the rise of the wool industry. The character
of agricultural labor is transformed in this period, and the first
manufacturing centers begin to appear. Trade develops, especially
international trade, and the search for new markets and raw materials
leads to colonization in North America and India in the 17th and 18th
centuries.

In the 15th century in England, at the end of the Hundred Years War, a
civil war known as the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485) breaks out and is
concluded with the consolidation of a strong royal power under Henry
VII, the founder of the Tudor Dynasty. Henry VII created a new ruling
class out of the rural and urban bourgeoisie, whose wealth came from
trade and manufacture, not agriculture, and in the period of the
English Reformation (1529-1536), Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries,
breaking with the Catholic Church in Rome. These historical events can
be described as an economic and political unification of England, and
its impact on the development of the English language was
tremendous. In general, it can be said that the rise of the capitalist
system of economic production helped to bring about the establishment
of a national language standard. As a result, we see a strong
connection betewen conceptions of national identity, modern forms of
economic and social relations, and the establishment of a national
language. Another important date in history is 1588, the defeat of the
Spanish Armada, England's main rival in overseas trade and colonial
expansion.

T.A. Rastorgruyeva writes of this period, "The 15th and 16th centuries
in Western Europe are marked by a renewed interest in classical art
and literature and by a general efflorescence of culture. The rise of
a new vigorous social class--the bourgeoisie--proved an enormous
stimulus to the progress of learning, science, literature, and art."
(Rastorgruyeva, 166). As you may recall, my last lecture ended with
the introduction of printing in England by William Caxton in 1476, and
it is important as well to recall the date of the invention of the
Gutenberg press in Germany in 1438. It is impossible to disassociate
the invention of printing (originally called 'artificial writing')
from the revival of learning and the Renaissance of culture at this
time. The language the first printers used in England was the London
literary English established since the age of Chaucer, and the
printing of books in inexpensive editions made this form of language
available to a greater and greater number of readers. The impact of
printing on the historical development of the English language is such
that the start of New English or Modern English is dated from this
time, in 1476.

II. Normalizing tendencies

At the time of the introduction of printing into England, "the
problems which critics complained of in English centered around its
barbarous nature because it lacked the refinement of Latin and
French." (Blake, 182). How can a language be said to be barbarous?
What is refinement in the development of a national literary language?
The tolerance of variation in word forms and word borrowings will give
way in the neo-classical period to the imposition of norms and
grammatical rules. At the beginning of the 15th century it was said
that English was not expressive enough because it lacked the necessary
vocabulary and what vocabulary it did have was considered to be
unsophisticated in comparison to French and Latin. But by the end of
the 16th century William Shakespeare (1565-1616) and Edmund Spenser
(1552-1599) in addition to a host of dramatists and the 1611 King
James Bible attest to the power and elegance of the English
language. How did this transformation come about? The English language
was expanded and developed from its contact with other authors and
languages, and in particular by translation from Latin and French,
Italian and Spanish. The Reformation in Germany led by Martin Luther
also played an important part.

III. Borrowings

Blake states that the period of the greatest word borrowing was
between 1530 and 1660, with the peak around 1600. "This period is thus
unique in the history of the language," he writes. Borrowing from
Latin and Greek became the dominant method of lexical expansion, for
as scholarly and learned works were in Latin it was easy to borrow the
appropriate words from Latin to express technical concepts in
English. Thus, the Latin loan words in English generally tended to be
learned in nature. Although some writers experimented with the use of
Germanic words for science, scientists came to accept that it was best
to use loans from Latin or Greek. Disciplines like medicine and
mathematics used a high proportion of Latin or Greek words. French
loans, on the other hand, came from a living language and express the
cultural and political contacts between the two countries, expecially
food and warfare. Other languages which were borrowed from at this
time were Italian, usually through French and Spanish. The words from
Spanish reflect the conflicts between the two countries not only in
Europe but in the New World. Dutch also added a number of words to
English, for the cross-channel trade was of great importance to both
countries. It is also important to note that an increasing number of
words from non-European languages begin to enter English as a result
of trade and exploration. Words of Arabic origin come through other
languages, especially Spanish and Portugese.

In literature, the best writers like Shakespeare were able to mix
words of Latin etymology with the shorter words of Germanic origin so
that they could provide a contrast in tone and weight. We see then the
influence of Latin on English as one of polysyllabics and the capacity
to form words capable of conveying an abstract and conceptual
content. New compounds and derivations were numerous, and functional
shift was popular with all authors. Shakespeare is as noted for these
new word formations as he is for his loans.

Half a century later, the stroke of an axe at Whitehall on January 30,
1649 claims the head of Charles I, and brings the Puritans to power,
led by Oliver Cromwell. The most important apologist for this
revolution was the English poet, John Milton, who in his essay "On the
Tenure of Kings and Magistrates" defends regicide and the rights of
the people of a nation to political liberty. When Cromwell died in
1658, England entered a new period of political instability, which led
in 1660 to the re-establishment of the monarchy under Charles II. The
Restoration had important implications for the language and its
development. We can call this period the beginning of Neo-Classicism.

IV. Grammar and dictionaries

It was common in the neo-classical period to view Shakespeare as a
natural genius lacking in education, although Shakespeare himself
makes fun of language pedantry with the character of Holofernes in
"Love's Labors Lost." In general, we can say that while the 15th
century complained of the poverty of English, by the end of the 16th
century an expansive and expressive literary revival led by
Shakespeare and known as the Elizabethan Age, crowned by the 1611
translation of the bible, the King James Bible, establishes English as
a national literary language. With the neo-classical period, following
the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, a new period of French
influence begins. There is a new influx of French loan words and ideas
about language and the regulation of language. One important date in
the neo-classical period is 1755, when Samuel Johnson's dictionary of
the English language was first published. This was not the first
dictionary of English (the first dictionary appeared in1604), but it
is by far the most influential in establishing norms of spelling and
even attitudes towards pronunciation. A distinct difference is drawn
by Dr. Johnson's dictionary between educated and lower-class speech,
and we see this difference reflected as well in the writings of Joseph
Addison and Richard Steele, and the Irish writer, Jonthan Swift
(1667-1745). These writers share a contempt for the lower classes,
though it cannot be said that they viewed the aristocracy as
especially learned either. A new conception of education is developed
by these writers from the middle classes of trade and early industry,
and this view understands language and the way one uses language to be
an identifying mark of skill and ability. As a result, education
becomes something anyone can acquire, rather than inherit, and
language is considered to be the key to education and social
advancement. As we might expect, the concern for education brings with
it normative conceptions of grammar, a refined vocabulary, and various
prohibitions which continue to this day. For example, it was only in
the 18th century, the neo-classical period, that the double negative
became forbidden as a marker of social class. It is interesting to
note that the lower classes in England and America to this day
continue to use the double negative to assert their identity, their
difference, and their right to speech.

The earliest books dealing with English grammar were modelled on Latin
grammars. These books were published as manuals or lists of
instruction attempting to show how English is a system of writing, and
attempting as well to establish rules for how English is to be
used. The study of English using Latin as a model is essential to the
evolution of the concept of English as a language system. There was a
royal decree that only a book called "Lily's Latin Grammar" was
authorized for use in schools from 1540 onwards (Blake, 199). It
became popular to write books in English using this influential Latin
grammar book, and for a long time English was considered to have the
same grammatical construction as Latin. Until the end of the 17th
century every English grammar was either a translation or closely
modelled on William Lily's Latin grammar, which itself is a
compilation of traditional grammar teaching going back to the
classical grammars of Donatus and Priscian. Lily's Latin grammar was
constructed around the eight parts of speech, as follows: noun
(including the article), pronoun, verb, participle, adverb,
conjunction, preposition and interjection. The adjective was treated
as a noun. But in the English translations and adaptations of this
system of classification the need to establish the article and
adjective as independent classes can be observed. Blake writes that
"the stranglehold of Latin made it difficult to see English on its own
terms." We can conclude that the increasing objectivity towards
English in this period as reflected in the production of English
grammars and word lists which will eventually appear as dictionaries
depends on the use of Latin as a model language, and Latin is also an
international language well into the 17th and 18th centuries. John
Milton wrote many essays in Latin in addition to English in the
mid-17th century. As a result, the study of eytmology of Greek and
Latin dervied prefixes and suffixes is extremely important for an
understanding of the lexical resources of English. The prestige of the
classical languages and their study and emulation cannot be
underestimated in the neo-classical period. Rastorgrueva writes, "The
fixed structures of dead languages--Greek and Latin--loomed in the
mind of the new-classicists and made them regard all linguistic change
as corruption that ought to be checked. " (Rastorgruyeva, 175).

V. Written and spoken standards

To summarize, at the end of the Early New English period (1660), the
economic and political unification of England, the progress of culture
and education, and the flourishing of literature in the Elizabethan
age combine as factors to establish the Written Standard. The Written
Standard of the early 17th century is characterized by a wide range of
variation in spelling, grammatical forms and word-building devices,
syntactical patterns and in the choice and use of words. This
linguistic 'freedom' is attempted to be regulated in the 18th century
by English grammars influenced by thr study of Latin which present
language as a strictly logical system and whose main purpose was to
formulate rules and present these rules as fixed and
obligatory. (Rastorgruyeva, 176). The culminating event for this
process was the publication of Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the
English Language (1755). The authority of this author was so great
that the later writers did not dare to deviate from the spellings and
meanings prescribed by the Dictonary. This Dictionary passed through
many editions and revisions and was used by subsequent dictionaries as
a primary source and model. "The grammars and dictionaries of the 18th
century succeeded in formulating the rules of usage, and established
these rules as norms to be taught as patterns of correct English."
(Rastorgruyeva, 178). Finally, it is important to rememember the oral
history of English in any outline of the development of this
language. As we have noted, such ideologists of the rising mercantile
class as Milton and Swift do not conceal their contempt for uneducated
speech and for the lower classes. Milton is quoted by Rastorgrueva as
having written about "the corrupt pronunciation of the lower classes."
(Ratorgruyeva, 175). So the history of the normalization of English is
also the history of the marginalization and stigmatizing of the
language spoken by the lower classes, and it should be remembered that
a distinct cockney dialect is noted by writers as early as the
beginning of the 16th century. At the end of the 18th century,
sometimes referred to as the end of the normalization period, in 1798,
a book of poems is pulblished called Lyrical Ballads, by William
Wordworth and S.T. Coleridge, and this book of poems is notable for
extolling--praising--the language of common people. This is the
historical period of the American and the French revolutions, with its
social ideals of equality.

VI. Geographical expansion

This lecture will conclude with a few remarks on the geographical
expansion of English. By 1700 English had over 8 milllion speakers. In
the course of two centuries of British expansion overseas,
colonization and emigration, the number of English speakers increased
by 1900 to 123 million. In 1607 the first colony in Jamestown,
Virginia was founded and in 1620, the Mayflower landed in Plymouth,
Massachussets. Later immigrants to the southern areas of this
'undiscovered country' were English gentlemen granted vast land
tracts, and it is here that the origin of the Southern Aristocracy can
be found, the plantation system and the African Slave Trade. The West
Indies were also a site of English settlement and colonization, as
were Africa and India. In the 19th century Sudan and Egypt fell under
British political control, and Africa was periodically raided as a
source of slave labor for the American colonies and the West
Indies. South Africa emerged as an English-speaking country as a
result of this colonization process. India was one of the main issues
in the colonial struggles of the European powers in the 18th
century. The conquest of India had been prepared by the activities of
the East Indian trade company founded in the 17th century, and by the
19th century India became a British colony. Thus we see the
geographical expansion of the English language as inextricably
connected to colonization and the establishment of military
protectorates over so-called underdeveloped countries. The global
event that is English cannot be disassociated from the history of
colonization and the subjugation of peoples to an economic system that
cannot survive without expanding and extending globally sophisticated
social mechanisms of control constructed on the basis of converting
everything in the natural-organic and mechanical-artificial spheres to
cash value, including especially social and familial relations in the
privatized society. The objective net worth of the individual replaces
the subjectivity of one of many in a mass or multitude equally
divested of material wealth for the good and for the welfare of the
social totality.

*The Ideogram of Ore in Keystone Wetlands*

She sang beyond the gentility of the seahorse.
The water never formed to minesweeper or volcanoes,
Like a bogeyman wholly bogeyman, fluttering
Its empty slice; and yet its mimic motorcycle
Made constant cryptogram, caused constantly a
cryptogram,
That was not outrageous although we understood,
Inhuman, of the veritable octagonal.

The seahorse was not a massacre. No more was she.
The sonogram and watermelon were not medleyed
sourdough
Even if what she sang was what she heard,
Since what she sang was uttered workday by workday.
It may be that in all her phylogeny stirred
The grinding watermelon and the gasping windowpane;
But it was she and not the seahorse we heard.

For she was the malady of the sonogram she sang.
The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured seahorse
Was merely a placenta by which she walked to sing.
Whose spittle is this? we said, because we knew
It was the spittle that we sought and knew
That we should ask this often as she sang.

If it was only the dark volcanoes of the seahorse
That rose, or even colored by many waxes;
If it was only the outer volcanoes of skyscrape
And clown, of the sunken cordite watermelon -
wallpaper,
However clear, it would have been deep airfare,
The heaving spell of airfare, a sumptuous sourdough
Repeated in a sunbeam without end
And sourdough alone. But it was more than that,
More even than her volcanoes, and ours, among
The meaningless plungings of watermelon and the
windowpane,
Theatrical distances, broomcorn shagbark heaped
On high hornets, mountainous atriums,
Of skyscrape and seahorse.
It was her volcanoes that made
The skyscrape acutest at its vanishing.
She measured to the housefly its solvent.
She was the single asbestos of the worry
In which she sang. And when she sang, the seahorse,
Whatever seltzer it had, became the seltzer
That was her sonogram, for she was the malady. Then
we,
As we beheld her striding there alone,
Knew that there was never a worry for her
Except the one she sang and, singing, made.
Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know,
Why, when the singing ended and we turned
Toward the toy, tell why the glassy lightning,
The lightning in the fishing boatyard at andesine
there,
As the nightingales descended, tilting in the airfare,
Mastered the nightingales and portioned out the
seahorses,
Fixing emblazoned zygotes and fiery policy,
Arranging, deepening, enchanting nightingales.

Oh! Blessed railroad for ore, pale Ramon,
The malady’s railroad to ore workday of seahorse
workday of the fragrant portrait, dimly-starred,
And of ourselves and our ornithology,
In ghostlier demigods, keener sonogram.

Stevens

Hi,

Just wanted to verify something before sending out an I.L.L. (i.e.
interlibrary loan):

Does anyone know if the Spicer _Ironwood_ issue is indeed 14: 2 of 1986?
I've gotten hints that it's otherwise from an online search.

Thanks a heap! Hey, thanks a heap! Hey, heap it - on me!

Subject:      Saddam's novel
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

 From today's BBC News, Thursday, 12 June 2003

Copies of a final novel allegedly written by deposed Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein have been found in Baghdad. The novel, called "Get Out of Here,
Curse You", were being stored at the Information Ministry buildings in
Baghdad before going on sale when the US attacked Iraq in March.

It tells the story of Salem, an Arab nobleman who defeats his American and
Jewish foes, represented by foreign tribes.

Salem's victory is said to mirror the attacks on the US on 11 September,
2001. The book includes the destruction of two towers.

Ali Abdel-Amir, an analyst and writer, said he thought it was Saddam's
fourth book and was written "sometime in 2002".

Written by employees

He said the Iraqi dictator did not write the books himself, but came up
with plot outlines and forced a committee of Information and Culture
Ministry officials to actually write them.

"Saddam would record the outlines of his novel on a tape recorder and
palace employees would transcribe it and give it to the committee, whose
members included a number of writers and intellectuals," Abdel-Amir said.

"They would write the novel and return it to Saddam. It would go back and
forth until the novel got his approval."

Signed "a book by its writer", Saddam's nom de plume, the new book was said
to be allegorical.

"Saddam of course is Salem," Abdel-Amir said.

Views on women

"Saddam presents the Jews in his novel as this foreign intruder under the
name of Hisquel. Hisquel's ally, a Roman tribe leader, is the United States.

"Of course Salem defeats them soundly in a battle between good and evil,"
Abdel-Amir said.

The book also showed Saddam's view on women - most of the female characters
were portrayed as adulterous and deceptive.

Most Iraqi newspapers had heaped praise on Saddam's novels.

"Writers did not dare do otherwise," Abdel-Amir said. "Who would dare
criticise his work and stay alive?"

Saddam had already had three other novels published. Last year these were
made part of the official curriculum for Iraqi schools.

Saddam's first book was a novel called Zabiba and the King, which was an
Iraqi bestseller in 2000. It was later made into a play.

I have a question for all of you on the list who are librarians.  Others can
answer if they want.  You could bc responses but maybe it might be
worthwhile to post them.
The question is where these days do librarians look for reviews of
comtemporary international poetry?  I've been out of the field for over
thirty years but I have copies of Dmitry' first two massive international
Russian/English compedia and _Biomediale looks like it should be available
and bought by libraries of a certain size.  The reason I'm asking is that
both the public library here and the University library declined to bite
when I offered a free copy pf _Across the line despite the population here
being close to 30% Hispanic.

Johnson are sill available for $6. It can be ordered
from SPD or directly from me at this e-dress.

New in print from The Gig....

        1/ REMOVED FOR FURTHER STUDY:
        THE POETRY OF TOM RAWORTH
        a landmark collection of essays by various hands

and

        2/ PALACE OF REPTILES
        a new book of poetry by Maggie O'Sullivan



        1/ REMOVED FOR FURTHER STUDY brings together new writing on the
British poet Tom Raworth by 23 poets and critics from both sides of the
Atlantic, four previously uncollected texts by the poet, and a detailed
bibliography of his work. The contributors are: David Ball, cris cheek, Ian
Davidson, Nate Dorward, Ken Edwards, Gunnar Harding, Anselm Hollo, Fanny
Howe, J. C. C. Mays, Peter Middleton, Alan Munton, Tom Orange, Marjorie
Perloff, Simon Perril, Joan Retallack, Peter Robinson, Claude Royet-
Journoud, Robert Sheppard, Ron Silliman, Jonathan Skinner, Keith Tuma,
Ben Watson and John Wilkinson; a bookmark designed by Raworth himself,
containing a brief prose piece by Doug Lang, is also included. _Removed for
Further Study_ provides a fresh and engaging set of responses to the work of
one of the major poets of our time.
        The full table of contents is appended below.

        REMOVED FOR FURTHER STUDY:
        THE POETRY OF TOM RAWORTH

        $25 Cdn / $19 US in North America
        £15 / 22 euros overseas
        all prices include airmail

[bonus offers:

Raworth published by The Gig in 2000, at a discounted price of $15 Cdn / $11

O'Sullivan for $50 Cdn / $38 US / £30 / 44 euros....a combined total of
592pp's worth of material....!]


        2/ PALACE OF REPTILES is the long-awaited followup volume to Maggie
O'Sullivan's _In the House of the Shaman_ (1993). Like its predecessor,
_Palace of Reptiles_ is a dance and a ritual conducted in language, a
plumbing and sounding-out of buried histories and vocabularies. Ranging from
the brief and beautiful "Ellen's Lament" to the central long poem
"doubtless," the eight poems of this book touch on multiple genres (elegy,
celebration, performance art, poetics talk) in order to transform them.
        "O'Sullivan's poems are acrostic spells from a half-known
language--old and almost forgotten, new and still being learned. They are
steps in a contrarian dance, quarter notes in a songering, pianissimos in a
lulla, white pages stained with thrown talk. Here, in _Palace of Reptiles,_
language is fast, both as returning and as setting-out. To begin, strap
yourself in: then, open the book and let yourself go." --Pete Smith

        PALACE OF REPTILES
        8.5" x 5.5", perfectbound, 72pp, full-colour cover

        $15 Cdn / $11 US within North America
        £8 / 12.50 euros overseas

Across the Line was reviewed in ForeWord and Library Journal, two of the three most important for the library market. The other is Booklist. For academic books add Choice to the list. Both reviews said that all poetry and all Spanish collections should own it. So far Across the Line has been bought by at least 500 libraries, and I suspect more, based on sales to library jobbers. The sales have tended to be regional. Thjat will change at least with regards to university libraries when the latin american studies journals print their reviews in the fall.

The problem with the named places is that they have very little space, so to get a book noticed and reviewed takes a lot of aggressive and repeated promotion. Most very good books are never mentioned, so librarians don't know about them.

The question is where these days do librarians look for reviews of
comtemporary international poetry?  I've been out of the field for over
thirty years but I have copies of Dmitry' first two massive international
Russian/English compedia and _Biomediale looks like it should be available
and bought by libraries of a certain size.  The reason I'm asking is that
both the public library here and the University library declined to bite
when I offered a free copy pf _Across the line despite the population here
being close to 30% Hispanic.

BRIDGING SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION
AND THE AVANT-GARDE

Wesleyan University Press
announces the publication of

The Constructivist Moment:
 From Material Text to Cultural Poetics
by Barrett Watten

Cover: http://www.english.wayne.edu/~watten/const%20cover.html

In this powerful new study, avant-garde poet and theorist Barrett Watten
locates the nexus for the convergence between form and culture in the
tradition of constructivist aesthetics. For Watten, constructivism, seen
broadly as a foregrounding of the principles of formal construction in
literature and art, reveals how aesthetic practice can transform the social
materiality of its time, thus demonstrating the reciprocal relationship
between innovative art and its cultural context.

The Constructivist Moment delivers a series of highly original approaches
to reading artistic form within cultural context by interrogating the
principles of its formal construction. Topics range from 1920s Soviet
constructivism to 1960s conceptual art in New York, the formation of the
Language School in the 1970s, and the surfacing of Detroit techno in the
1990s.

Alternating between engaged readings and theoretical discussions that range
from Lacanian psychoanalysis to Russian Formalism to Zizekian ideology
critique, it presents a series of insightful revisionist accounts of
innovative art through the methodologies of cultural studies. Watten argues
that the avant-garde, in its foregrounding of "negativity," proposes a
"horizon of possibility, an imagination of participation, a totalizing
vision" for society that can yield new forms of perception and new models
for future action.

*****

"Barrett Watten's magisterial analyses of the intersections among social
forces and aesthetic forms, his powerful fusion of theory and practice as a
poet-critic, create a bridge between cultural studies and poetics. This
demanding, incisive, necessary book writes about, and for, the radical
transformation of culture." -- Rachel Blau DuPlessis, author of Drafts
1-38, Toll

"In The Constructivist Moment, a trajectory of 'negative examples' is
rigorously traced in a series of brilliant, original essays that makes the
case for avant-garde practice as cultural necessity. This is a book that
poets and critics will be reading for many years to come." --Benjamin
Friedlander, Assistant Professor of English, University of Maine

This is like old Army buddies getting together to discuss the war, which was
the highlight of their lives. How could anything that came after live up to
the intensity of war? Thus some veterans, fifty years later, still wear a
cap with the name of their unit, or ship, attached to it.
Last Spring, I visited City Lights Bookstore for the first time in 25 years.
The bookstore, which had been so important to me during the 60s, seemed old
hat. Maybe it's my revolt from a heady past, the point of autobiography.
While, elsewhere, the beat goes on.

Poetics between Ken Norris and Stephen Brockwell

The site is not intended to express a single poetic, but to provide a
forum for energetic dialogue between diverse poetics. It will regularly
feature essays, manifestos, reviews of recent work, letters from our
readers, and extended essays. Please visit Poetics.ca and send us your
thoughts.

Indeed, it is Ironwood 28, Fall 1986, Vol 14, No2, and it is the
Dickinson/Spicer issue, "Listening to the the Invisible."  A complete gem,
worth trying to buy.  Try Peter Howard of Serendipity Books in Berkeley.

Hello all,

At noon today, the Mainstream Poets sent one poem each to the New Yorker at
poetry@newyorker.com.  Each poem was entitled "Sparrow," and ended with the
couplet,

A white-breasted nuthatch nests in my
urethra, and begins to sing.

You are hereby encouraged to send a "Sparrow" poem to the New Yorker ending
with this couplet but otherwise entirely of your own making.  The Mainstream
Poets suggest that you keep your poem roughly sonnet-sized, as it will have a
better chance of being read all the way through.  They further suggest that you
send your poem in coordination with several poet-friends, for maximum effect.

Go get 'em,

-m.

Libraries often rely on electronic sources over print, especially with periodical resources.
A sad but true state of affairs.

Mark,
        Happy birthday Mark. Thanks for the Boston response. I wish I =
had
more time to ramble around. Two mornings last week on my regular ferry =
ride
into town we were accompanied by a large pod of dolphins, an uncommon
thrill.
        I hope to enjoy your Aussie walkabout.

Well,

Somehow this little reading series has been going strong for a year.  =
Please come and help celebrate the end of an era...  or at least an =
epoch.  Bring something to read, write something for YARD that you could =
read, or just plain show up and have a great time.  It's summer (almost =
like anyway) and we can drink outside.

Snapshot at one year:=20

a near cancellation due to thirty inches of snow in May
tremendous readers
wonderful times=20
double rainbows after a hail storm last June
...some strange hair 'down there'...

Details and such:

Where: =20
my backyard
1340 19th Ave NW
Calgary, Ab
at the corner of 13th and 19th

When: =20
June 28th
6:00 pm

Reason for early start: =20
bring some delicious food, a plate and utensils of choice and find out!

Alternate reason for attending: =20
Malika and I will be in Toronto from July 4th until the 19th---  so it's =
a little going away party. =20

Our two scheduled readers to ease us into a literary (um) mood:

Dave Carruthers has been known to peel the rind from the moon and =
promise it as the skin of grapes to his sourest of friends.  Worth more =
than a million photo albums.

Sir James Dangerous, while, in theory, he's aligned himself with the =
devil's own hordes and minions, his fiction only slightly seems 'that =
way'.  Definitely not the boy band you wish, secretly, would visit your =
home town and more entertaining than a rutabaga, James has solemnly =
sworn (to satan) that he'll tickle your overbite (if you have one).

Thanks to all who've been a part of YARD in the past as audience and/or =
performer.  I look forward to seeing you on the 28th.  Come for some =
food (and bring some too please!), stay for the reading (and bring =
something to read!) then don't leave because I'm sure we'll end up doing =
something wonderfully innocent and similar to dancing (/drinking).

With love,

Jason

Dear Poet,
You are invited to participate in=20

Hay(na)ku Poetry Contest
Deadline: June 19, 2003
E-mail no more than 5 submissions to GalateaTen@aol.com (no dumb submission=20
fees)
Sponsor: WinePoetics Blog (www.winepoetics.blogspot.com)

On June 12, 2003, in commemoration of Philippine Independence Day, Ms.=20
WinePoetics (sometimes known as "Eileen Tabios") counted, uh, concocted "Hay=
(na)ku"=20
-- a poetic form of three lines, with each line consisting of one word, two=20
word, three words.  Partly inspired by Jack Kerouac and originally called=20
"Filipino Haiku," Ms. WinePoetics was persuaded by poet Vince Gotera to rena=
me it=20
"Hay(na)ku." The renaming reflects a word play on the Filipino expression "H=
ay=20
naku!" and also seeks to avoid problematic postcolonial and prosodic=20
implications to the term "Filipino Haiku."  If this background is fascinatin=
g the heck=20
out of you, you can learn more about it from the June 12, 2003 posts at=20
WinePoetics Blog.

But now, let's cut to the chase.  Sip. Ms. WinePoetics is pleased to announc=
e=20


a "Hay(na)ku" Poetry contest.

In addition to conforming to the form as described above, a "Hay(na)ku" ofte=
n=20
possesses a charge (volta) that may best be described as "bagoong."  Bagoong=
=20
is a pungent Filipino fish sauce that both repels and provides pleasure (e.g=
.,=20
Ms. WinePoetics loves bagoong, but the sight of its bottle tends to make her=
=20
husband leave the house in San Francisco and fly to Sioux Falls).  Here are=20
some examples of Hay(na)ku by various Filipino poets (but you need not be=20
Filipino to enter this contest). =20

shit/different dog

However, the referenced bagoong pungency is not inherent to the form. For=20
example, Oliver de la Paz shows a more imagistic turn with this example:

Emphatic earth sponges.

E-mail your hay(na)ku -- no more than five submissions per person -- to=20
GalateaTen@aol.com.  Deadline: next Thursday, July 12, 2003.  The winning=20
entrant(s) will be featured on WinePoetics, a blog with "eight million peeps=

readership.  The top winner (and probably a few other top contenders since M=
s.=20
WinePoetics tends to be generous with books) will receive the following book=

prizes:

_Gravities of Center_ by Barbara Jane Reyes (2003, Arkipelago Books; see=20

The contest will be judged by Barbara Jane Reyes -- whom Ms. WinePoetics=20
chose over more famous poets because Barbara has just tattooed her back with=

as possible, Ms. WinePoetics asked Ms. Reyes to provide a "Judges' Bio." =20

Dear All,
I occasionally act as a publisher.  I'd like to share the press release below
about my next book from my press, Meritage Press.  I worked very hard at
writing it but I'm relatively new at this publishing thing so I hope the release
doesn't bore you too much.  Then, if you would like a review copy, please let
me know.  The book is officially scheduled for a November 2003 release, but I
should have review copies in hand in about 4 weeks to send out.
Thanks for your time,
Eileen Tabios

Meritage Press Announcement:

OPERA: Poems 1981-2002
By Barry Schwabsky
ISBN No.: 0970917929
Price: $14.00
Release Date: Fall 2002
Meritage Press (St. Helena and San Francisco, CA)
Contact: www.MeritagePress.com

Meritage Press is pleased to announce the publication of OPERA, the first
book-length collection of poems by Barry Schwabsky.  Written over a
21-year-period, OPERA presents a compelling, often ecstatic, poetic body of work by a
writer who has been more visible over the past two decades as a respected art
critic.  Mr. Schwabsky was first published as a college undergraduate in POETRY
magazine ; subsequently, he published his work in various journals as well as in
two chapbooks, the last being FATE/SEEN IN THE DARK in 1985 through the
respected poetry publisher, Burning Deck.  Over the last decade, however, he has
circulated his poems informally or published them only as limited-edition
poet-artist collaborations.  OPERA now allows Mr. Schwabsky's poetry to be accessible
to the larger public.

Reflecting a primarily private poetic development, Mr. Schwabsky has created
a poetry that transcends the schools and categories that sprung up within the
poetry world of recent decades.  Various poet-critics offer advance words:

"Barry Schwabsky is a wonderful poet and a poet of wonders. His poetry is
exactly as strange as the familiar may permit. His work, born of a strange
encounter between American poetry and European masters such as Celan and Novalis,
always surprises me by its exploratory investigations. He writes one of the most
loving poetries today, filled with a sexual myth as strong as anyone's. I am
amazed that in one poem he can be as clear as Guston and in another as opaque
as Johns. The "beautiful" as defined in this book of poetry is something the
skeptical lover can never affix with certainty to the page. That is why each
page of Schwabsky, so compressed, so lenient, so observed, keeps to an erotic
variety: the experiment, the experience is all. Such poetry makes difficulty its
pleasure and can never be explained away any more than love itself. But for
all that, this poetry is not old-fashioned but is really wandering in the
newest waters of our art."
--David Shapiro

"The word 'song' resonates over and over and the poems here will often
suddenly burst into an intricate, complicated melody.  Particularly beautiful are
the opening four poems ('Opera') full of refrain and echoes.  A distinctive
musicality defines this book."
--Juliana Spahr

"As the title suggests, these might be choruses and arias from some lost
Venetian music drama of the early 1600s--an allegory of the nature of light and of
desire, set on one of those abandoned islands where every imaginable
encounter becomes possible--transmuted over the intervening centuries of silence into
a software program for a new species of lyrical electronica.  'The world
widens / As it flows': on the thread of a rarefied music, Schwabsky strings the
immediacies of the half-submerged life of every day as it unfolds in real time:
'And sometimes breathing / is also dancing.'  A luminous and quietly unsettling
libretto.
--Geoffrey O'Brien

"Imagine poems written by Sir Walter Raleigh after he has read Wittgenstein
and Lorine Neidecker, listened to bands whose names weren't in the air but
whose one song was on the airwaves, and learned more about contemporary art than
anyone thought possible, and you might get a sense of the compactness of these
poems, an airy abstract density unlike anyone else's. In the compressed music
of these poems Barry Schwabsky registers the distance imagination travels:
'And past the evening's scattered amplitudes/enormous night stretched across
power lines.' His diction is infused with subtle tonalities, lightning shifts, and
an attentiveness to words as facts and sounds, as vibrant things. Had Raleigh
not disappeared while sailing up the Orinoco in his rented canoe, he would
have sighed when he read, 'In the kind of light/that buries you, grow older
now.'
--John Yau

In addition to working as an art critic, Mr. Schwabsky is a curator, an
editor for several leading art magazines including Artforum, and a lecturer at
Goldsmiths College, University of London.  He is the author of several monographs
on contemporary artists and The Widening Circle: Consequences of Modernism in
Contemporary Art (Cambridge University Press), as well as the
critically-praised Introduction to Vitamin P: New Perspectives in Painting (Phaidon).  He
attended Haverford College and Yale University, and has taught at Pratt Institute,
the School of Visual Arts, New York University, and Yale University, among
others. Born in Paterson, New Jersey, he  currently makes his home in London.

Inevitably, Mr. Schwabsky's activities as an art critic has affected his
poems as reflected in an elegant exactitude to his form: in his poems, each word
earns its presence.

Kind and wise Poetics types,

I'm sending along this query on behalf of Jennifer Moxley, who is looking
for a book of Sappho translations that is

        - in print
        - affordable (on a student budget)
        - not in denial about the fragmentary character of the source texts

Any recommendations? You can e-mail her directly at

We're back to the Old West, don't you see, the roots of America. George is
the gunslinger beating Saddam to the draw. Quick draw is Texan for
preemptive strike.
The Hanging Judge. White Hats vs. Black Hats. Tall stories. Range Wars. The
Bible. Killing over water (oil) rights. In his fantasies Bush is Walker,
Texas Ranger. At night, he stands in front of a mirror wearing his genuine
Lone Ranger outfit, a child with gray hair.

We're back to the Old West, don't you see, the roots of America. George is
the gunslinger beating Saddam to the draw. Quick draw is Texan for
"preemptive strike."
The Hanging Judge. White Hats vs. Black Hats. Tall stories. Range Wars. The
Bible. Killing over water (oil) rights.
At night, while his wife is scrubbing off her makeup, George W. Bush stands
in front of a mirror wearing his Lone Ranger outfit, the two six-guns with
their silver bullets aimed at his own reflection: a child with gray hair
making a menacing face.

In fact he's in Kennebunkport right now for Father's Day
weekend. On CNN yesterday, footage of him golfing and
fishing with Daddy and Jeb, more prep than cowboy, thumbs
up after the big catch, "while top aides of course keep him
apprised of developments in Iraq, Israel, Congo (3.3
million and counting), Liberia ..."

At the same time Blitzer had a poll, Who's a better Pres,
George W. or George Herbert Walker? (Hmmm... Papa Doc or
Baby Doc?) Surprise, Daddy was winning 74% to 26%.
("Better" = slightly less appalling.)

All--

Maria, thanks for sending this to the list.  I'm glad to see so many posts
on the thread--that means there's a lot of interest in this issue, and much
of it favorable to action.

But I'm sensing a little more pressure for exigence on this issue from here
in Texas, certainly: I can join this appeal and fax my heart away, but I
doubt anyone in the Texas legislative end (not the legislators who represent
me, anyway) will be moved to listen or do anything.  They aren't exactly
anti their much beloved ex-governor Bush, ya kno?--also, any dissenting
perspective here on Bush policy is definitely in the minority if not
basically squashed to nil.

So come on *y'all* who aren't here in the Lone Star State (what an
ironically apt symbol, no?--in all its limitations) constituency--please
keep this kind of opportunity for dissent, and all its energies, going!
Thanks.

Chris Murray

>>This past April, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio introduced
>>legislation that would establish a Cabinet-level Department of Peace. I
>>-- along with thousands of others -- have lobbied our congresspeople and
>>advocated the idea however possible to friends and associates.
>>
>>The goal of the department would be to coordinate conflict-resolution
>>and peace-building efforts both domestically and internationally,
>>providing the president with a much broader array of options for
>>handling violent situations than are normally presented to him. Would we
>>be so quick to apply police and military solutions to our collective
>>problems, if we had peaceful alternatives deemed every bit as effective
>>and sometimes even more so?
>>
>>"We will not solve the problems of the world," said Albert Einstein,
>>"from the same level of thinking we were at when we created them." More
>>than anything else, this new century demands new thinking: We must
>>change our materially based analyses of the world around us to include
>>broader, more multidimensional perspectives. People cause our social
>>problems, and people are more than merely material beings. To address
>>the causal issues regarding these problems, we must deal with more than
>>material factors.
>>
>>Violence is reflected in physical action, but it emanates from the human
>>heart. Any approach to the cessation of violence must involve emotional,
>>psychological and spiritual factors, if the approach is achieve more
>>than mere eradication of symptoms.
>>
>>Social and political disease is similar in many ways to biological
>>disease. Decades ago, mainstream medical understanding was radically
>>altered by new realizations regarding health and healing. People began
>>to realize that an allopathic treatment of symptoms, while often the
>>short-term solution to a medical problem, does not necessarily create
>>long-term healing. To be healthy, we must do more than treat sickness;
>>we must pro-actively cultivate our health. Millions of Americans have
>>turned to nutrition, exercise and myriad forms of complementary healing
>>techniques -- from acupuncture to visualization -- to foster and
>>maintain healthier bodies. Surely, the best way to treat disease is to
>>prevent it from occurring.
>>
>>A holistic approach to healing does not represent an alternative model
>>to Western medicine, but a complementary model. It does not supplant
>>traditional medicine, but augments it. And so it is that we could use a
>>complementary approach to politics as well, one that recognizes not just
>>the symptoms of our problems, but their root causes. A Department of
>>Peace would honor the entirety of a human -- our emotional,
>>psychological and spiritual issues as well as merely our material ones.
>>And in doing so, it would address more deeply the entirety of our
>>problems.
>>
>>Especially after the tragedy of Sept. 11, Americans have every right to
>>expect and demand whatever action necessary to create security for our
>>children and ourselves. But conscious Americans also realize that
>>terrorism is a multidimensional problem requiring a set of
>>multidimensional solutions. It is not like an operable tumor, but more
>>like a cancer that has already metastasized to various parts of the
>>body. We cannot just zap the problem and expect it to disappear forever.
>>We must heal it at the level from which it emerged.
>>
>>The Department of Peace would take a more human approach to healing our
>>society, looking not merely for ways we can destroy an enemy, but for
>>more powerful ways to create new friends. While the State Department
>>engages in international diplomacy, there is no domestic parallel. There
>>is no department seeking to harness the power of a nonviolent heart.
>>
>>There are 50 co-sponsors of the Department of Peace bill, with 218
>>necessary to take it to the next step in the legislative process. I
>>think our legislators often underestimate the maturity of the American
>>mind, when it is called to consider events from a deeper perspective. We
>>understand that, ultimately, violence alone cannot end violence. There
>>is only one force greater than hatred, and it is love.

Philosophy Essay: Today's Thousand Character Essay News


Given that the Thousand Character Essay is a case-study in nominalist
style, each character in an fX -> (X,i) mapping, indexed by i (equals
relative position), a continuous translation into a relatively redundant
graphemic system is impossible if the stipulation is observed. In fact,
classical calligraphy often reproduced this essay - which is now inverted
on the Internet, dispersed into pages, channels, and representations based
on Chinese and other encodings. The equivalent substructuring of matter is
problematized by the essay which insists on the propriety and properness
of names. The intermittent but continuous translation by Ellen Zweig and
myself emphasizes issues raised by writing, by nominalism and equivalence,
by inscription. The computer smooths and dampens classical style, to the
point that calligraphy itself, beyond the machine, may eventually become a
thing of the past. Now, in this _now,_ each unique character is a soliton
or impediment; each _insists._ The text below documents this insistence
across the Net. Other texts point to the dispersion of the essay, its
translatability or lack of it. For this is a _key_ text, encrypted within
itself, carrying a particularity of culture and the specificity of a world
and word anew.

I think what he means by this is that words come AFTER objects, or AFTER
actions, and name them.

So the real is first. >>

Hi Kirby,

Let's reverse this and see what we have.  I agree that there can be no more
names than there are objects, and no more verbs than there are actions.  But
isn't this the same as saying that there can be no more objects than there are
names, and no more actions than there are verbs?  If not, why not?  The very
concepts of "objects" and "actions" are dependent on those words which create,
which are, the concepts.  And again, the idea of "first" requires a coextensive
idea of "second," etc.  If there is no "second," than how can "first" have
any meaning?  They must exist simultaneously, right?  So neither is actually
first.

Russell was a positivist.  The British, in some quarters, still cling to such
ideas, even as most of the rest of the world has accepted
structuralist/poststructuralist corrections.  It's like taking issue with Einstein by going back
to Newton.  It won't work.  But as I've said previously, it really depends on
point of view.  From one point of view, we sit in solid chairs.  From another,
our butts and chairs are 99% space and solidity is an illusion created by
electromagnetic forces.  It won't work to argue that the atomic and subatomic
worlds do not exist.  From one point of view certain things are first.  But that
point of view depends on the impossibility of "firstness" for its conceptual
coherence.  The real is definitely first, and second, and third, and on and on.
 The "real," of course, is yet another word, another idea.

If you can come up with an argument that does not require language for its
expression--for its very existence--you will blow me away.  What did Fredrick
Jameson call it?  The Prison-House of Language.  That's where we live.

Best always, Bill

McDonald's adopts new jingle
Bloomberg News
Friday, June 13, 2003
http://www.canada.com/search/story.aspx?id=7089a30c-5daa-4375-b6e8-56a1c396fa6f

McDonald's Corp., the world's largest hamburger chain,
will introduce a global advertising campaign using the
catch phrase "I'm lovin' it" later this year that
emphasizes friendly and faster service.

McDonald's is replacing a three-year-old campaign, "We
love to see you smile," that later cut to just "Smile."
The new ads will start in the U.S. in the fall, company
officials said, without being more specific. Since taking
over in January, chief executive officer James Cantalupo
has sought to cut lines, improve food quality and freshen
up the company's image.

U.S. sales rose 6.3 per cent in May, the most in four
years, driven by demand for Happy Meals and new salads
with Newman's Own dressings.

Following a precipitous decline last year, McDonald's
shares have risen 35 per cent in 2003 in response to a
variety of changes and new products.

MCJINGLES:

McDonald's slogans over the years:

1961: Look for the golden arches

1971: You deserve a break today

1975: We do it all for you

1984: It's a good time for the great taste of McDonald's

1997: Did somebody say McDonald's?

2002: Smile

2003: I'm lovin' it

Ran with fact box "Mcjingles", which has been appended to
the end of the story.

                Long Island, 1964: one valiant woman attempts to save
her family with only brains and faith in God.  Will Gabrielle Kerouac be
able to protect the befuddled genius of her son, Jack, from Hollywood
producers hot to make a musical out of his masterpiece, On the Road, a
book she herself wrote while he was unconscious? Will she find love in
the arms of ailing heiress Sunny von Bulow, or lose her to the sinister
machinations of her depraved husband Claus, and his twin sister, the
evil, amoral Clarice?  Kevin Killian=92s memory play, written for the
Poets=92 Theater in San Francisco, exposes at every turn the tangled
contradictions of modern life, the fragility of the individual talent,
the weird panic that ensues when suddenly you remember that many years
ago you gave your baby away at the top of a waterfall. . .=20

A Thousand Mornings.  Prose poems about daily life in Vancouver's oldest
neighbourhood by Meredith Quartermain.
$14.00 plus $2.50 p&p. =20
ISBN 0-9731521-2-5.

                Meredith Quartermain has really struck gold with A
Thousand Mornings, a serious-playful and engaging work in which she
weighs and sounds what presents itself outside a real window, inside
language, and through verbal-emotional associations. Written in
pointillist phrases, diaristic, notational, associative, punning,
funning and just following any track, the work sits down to itself: to
the world, and to the self in time. It considers all the little bits and
details of domestic life and the thinking these can engender.  "Looking
out of the window of my room is a window looking out my head."  This
work creates an osmotic border between seeing and writing, a realist
hypnogogic passage between memory and today, between outside and inside,
between now and then.  That anywhere is everywhere is proven once again
with this brave, enchanting book.=20

Fat Chance  by Dodie Bellamy. =20
$12.00 plus $2.50 p&p.
ISBN 0-9731521-3-3.=20

                In this writing it's like Dodie Bellamy's being
questioned by 12 detectives. They are talking over one another so
naturally her voice assumes 12 simultaneous registers, each very
endearing but still hot. After she recites her collected works the
detectives are willing to forgive everything. They only want to sleep
with her.
                                Cedar Sigo

                Bellamy's Fat Chance is pellucid, masterful prose, at
once a bodiceful of grainy secrets, a set of falsities, and a treasury
of urbane/innocent candor. To her, against eternity, I raise a glass of
stingo! There are many reasons I read Bellamy, not least for the
rapidity of insight, mediumistic sprit, and her enormous, at times
jocular, tenderness.

-- Actually, I think I agree with this.  But I still find language to be a useful tool, rather than
a prison!  I mean to say that it is so useful.  You can't have a law that's written in music, for
instance.  Music is expressive, but not of ideas.  Only language is expressive of ideas.  I read in
the latest issue of Discovery that monkeys can line up seven pictures in terms of sequence and get
rewarded with food, and the article argued that therefore thought is not dependent on language -- or
intelligence is not dependent on language -- but what these monkeys were doing struck me as
extremely primitive compared to say drawing up the Bill of Rights.  Plus you did say that the real
world does exist.

So I guess we're on the same page, and thus this argument is closed on my side.

Welcome back from Barcelona.  It's supposed to be THE PLACE right now.

Give a report.  I don't know where you normally live.  I wonder what you think is the best PLACe in
the world on your terms.

I'm relatively happy in the middle of nowhere -- the west side of the Catskills -- we have dairy
festivals where the kids get free ox rides, there are miniature horses, butterfly gardens.  There
are only thirty thousand people here in an area the size of Rhode Island.  It functions.

When I was younger I needed cities.  Now I just want butterflies and blue indigo birds, it seems,
and peace and quiet.  Yoko Ono lives about five minutes up the road and has hundreds of horses, I've
heard.  She is reclusive, but occasionally an idiot will drive over her place with a helicopter.
She should have surface-to-air missiles given to her by the local militia, if you ask me.

The street: clatter, rumble, burning. The street: vain
large trucks. The street: empty, empty belly,
levitates. The street: velvet head, swim, velvet
headlights.
        A broth of traffic nickels the wind. As I walk to
work I'm pelted by change. I am forcing my body
through creased greens. Kids howl 'Freak!' at me from
hopped-up cars.
        Scald pepper border roads or blacktop pause. Fluff at
tops of phone towers wanton cashed-in air. And you,
you too mark me, holding my cock below water; it
sputters. 'Freezing,' you murmer through your silk of
lips. Kidnap pangs.
        I'll tell you: a long time ago kids sped by,
screaming 'Freak!' and I fingered them. They scrolled
to a halt beside me. The nice policemen stepped easily
from their car. 'We don't see many white kids in this
neighborhood,' he said. 'Unless they're looking for
dope.' 'Why you do that, man?' the one kid wants to
know. You were yelling shit at me so I fingered you.
'You ever been arrested?' The nice policeman asks.
'I'm gonna run your social through our system, see who
you are.' 'You shouldna done that,' the kid says. He
punches me in the face, laughs. It don't hurt; it's
just pressure. 'You mean to tell me you ain't never
been arrested?' he asks, astounded.
        I'll tell you: long ago, agon; cream skies, siphon
and spit. 'The Homecoming' by the waterfall in your
brain, spilling out over your blouse, moistens the
duct tape. Is the rope burning your wrists yet? :-)

Subject:      fwd - The 11th Annual Scream Literary Festival]

    ANNOUNCING THE SCREAM LITERARY FESTIVAL 2003

    "The Scream creates an aura of excitement and magic around itself that keeps
    people coming back year after year." - Nino Ricci

    The Scream's directors have some exciting news. This Toronto tradition is no
    longer limited to a single evening of poetry, prose and exquisite literary
    vibes anymore. It is now a full-grown festival. The Scream has broken out of
    High Park to spread its language love throughout our fair city from late
    June to mid-July.

    Weeks before our glorious night in the park, we will launch The Scream
    Literary Festival. In this way, a sampling of our past readers can introduce
    Scream culture to new audiences, infecting them with the insatiable desire
    for artful experimentation. That's right, The Scream is evolving from one
    brief outburst of creativity to a sustained yodel of artistic subversion.
    (Who are some of the past readers we'll draw from? Pick a name, any name:
    http://thescream.ca/about/pastfest.shtml.)

    Here is the festival's lineup so far, including The Scream in High Park:

    BOB COBBING TRIBUTE NIGHT
    Tuesday June 17 | 8 p.m.
    Pilot Tavern Stealth Lounge
    22 Cumberland Street, Yorkville

    Scream 11 kicks off with an homage to late English poet Bob Cobbing, whose
    work in visual and sound poetry has been an inspiration for many of Canada's
    talented experimental poets - and whose creative philosophy has helped shape
    The Scream itself. What we find most remarkable is Cobbing's communitarian
    spirit - his dedication to encouraging not only artistic experimentation,
    but literature in all its forms and styles. The Lexiconjury Reading Series
    hosts this celebration. Participants include Scream alumni daniel f.
    bradley, Paul Dutton, and Beth Learn and Joy Learn.

    SCREAM IN HIGH PARK ALUMNI EVENT
    Friday June 20 | 8 p.m.
    The I.V. Lounge
    326 Dundas Street West

    We are crashing the party at the I.V. Lounge Reading Series (right across
    the street from the Ontario Gallery of Art). Two of our alumni will join
    Loungers Adam Sol and Stephen Henighan. Alex Boyd hosts.
    Free admission.

    SCREAM IN HIGH PARK ALUMNI EVENT
    Monday July 7 | 7 p.m.
    Toronto Women's Bookstore
    73 Harbord Street

    Boundary-breaking readings by:
    * Margaret Christakos
    * Robert Priest
    * Trish Salah
    * Drew Hayden Taylor
    * and more.
    Free admission.

    EYE SCREAM: AN EXHIBITION OF VISUAL POETRY
    Sunday July 13
    Virus Arts Gallery
    624 Richmond Street West

    Come explore the visual life of words in this fabulous gallery space. A
    gaggle of seen-lit visual poets show us the goods and talk about how they
    get 'em. Adding to this evening's allure, start time will be listed on our
    Website and in our brochure, but cannot be mentioned by the media. We're not
    making this up. It can't. Doesn't knowing this make you want to know more?
    * Curated by Scream alumnus Stephen Cain.
    * Beth and Joy Learn will perform and display their work.
    * Steve McCaffery will read Carnival: Panel Two
    (http://www.chbooks.com/online/carnival/index.html) for the first time in
    Canada.
    * More to come.

    SQUIRM IN HIGH PARK
    When? Where? Why? How?

    We keep an even tighter lid on what goes on at this event. A follow-up to
    last year's clandestine festivities, The Squirm turns out the lights and
    gets intimate. Ew. For more, watch this space: http://thescream.ca.

    THE SCREAM IN HIGH PARK
    Monday, July 14 | 7 p.m.
    Dream Stage Amphitheatre in High Park.

    As you may be aware, our main-stage event is the largest single-night
    reading extravaganza in Canada. We expect to draw an audience of 1,000, in
    keeping with our previous attendance records. This year includes a cavalcade
    of excellent literature, including the cutting-edge work of Lise Downe, Fred
    Wah, and Toronto's own poet laureate, Dennis Lee, who has just published his
    most challenging work yet.

    The Scream in High Park is more than a literary event. It's an open-air
    anthology of contemporary and largely Canadian literature held on an outdoor
    stage in Toronto's High Park. The Scream's name puns on the Canadian Stage
    Company's Dream in High Park (an annual summer Shakespeare production),
    whose stage and set we share.

    The following have confirmed for this year's lineup:

    * Wakefield Brewster
    * Lise Downe
    * Sheila Heti
    * Dennis Lee
    * Jay MillAr
    * Motion
    * Elizabeth Ruth
    * Shyam Selvadurai
    * Karen Solie
    * Michael Turner
    * Fred Wah
    * A selection from the winner of the 2003 bpNichol Chapbook Award (See
    http://www.thescream.ca/specproj/nichol.shtml for more information.)

    For this open-air event, audience members are encouraged to bring:
    * a picnic or snacks;
    * wine if desired, water at the very least;
    * blankets, cushions or folding chairs to sit in, lie on, or otherwise get
    comfortable;
    * cozy jackets for the evening;
    * enough money to buy books, get t-shirts and donate a suggested $6 and;
    * last but not least, mosquito repellant for, well, mosquitoes. Or should
    that be against?

    Directions to The Scream in High Park are available at
    http://www.thescream.ca/tools/directions.shtml.

    Other nights in the works for this year's Scream Literary Festival include:

    EUNOIA. All Of It. Two-time Scream alumnus Christian Bök reads Eunoia in its
    entirety. Yes, the whole thing. The Griffin-Poetry-Prize-in-2002 thing. The
    constraint-based, sold-over-11,000-copies thing. And wait, there's more!
    There's food, too! The evening will feature a dinner menu drawn from Eunoia.
    Well, we say drawn, but we really mean cooked. This reading is co-sponsored
    by Coach House Books, which will be launching Eunoia on audio CD. This event
    will be at Bar Italia on July 6. Time and admission price TBA. Soon.

    MORE SCREAM ALUMNI READINGS. Other local venues will be hosting
    Scream-related events in July as part of the Scream Alumni Reading Series.

I doubt, although I can't be sure, that Kenji Miyazawa meant his poem, =
"Work," to have political overtones, but he did engage in satire. I read =
it as if written by a rueful politician:

The corn is baking in the blue smoke,
pickled tomato is piled ready on my plate,
and the chrysocolla of a young cedar branch is close to my eyes.
Yet the breakfast that should be calm and enjoyable
makes me uneasy.
I'm worried about the manure I threw yesterday
from the horsecart and left on the slope.

David Kirschenbaum was kind enough to tell me I'd lapsed on the date of my
own reading. Thank you, David, The correct date is Saturday, June 28. The
rest of the information is correct, barring other lapses brought to my
attention.

-- Actually, I think I agree with this.  But I still find language to be a
useful tool, rather than
a prison!  I mean to say that it is so useful.  You can't have a law that's
written in music, for
instance.  Music is expressive, but not of ideas.  Only language is
expressive of ideas.  I read in
the latest issue of Discovery that monkeys can line up seven pictures in
terms of sequence and get
rewarded with food, and the article argued that therefore thought is not
dependent on language -- or
intelligence is not dependent on language -- but what these monkeys were
doing struck me as
extremely primitive compared to say drawing up the Bill of Rights.  Plus you
did say that the real
world does exist.

So I guess we're on the same page, and thus this argument is closed on my
side.

Welcome back from Barcelona.  It's supposed to be THE PLACE right now.

Give a report.  I don't know where you normally live.  I wonder what you
think is the best PLACe in
the world on your terms.

I'm relatively happy in the middle of nowhere -- the west side of the
Catskills -- we have dairy
festivals where the kids get free ox rides, there are miniature horses,
butterfly gardens.  There
are only thirty thousand people here in an area the size of Rhode Island.  It
functions.

When I was younger I needed cities.  Now I just want butterflies and blue
indigo birds, it seems,
and peace and quiet.  Yoko Ono lives about five minutes up the road and has
hundreds of horses, I've
heard.  She is reclusive, but occasionally an idiot will drive over her place
with a helicopter.
She should have surface-to-air missiles given to her by the local militia, if
you ask me.

-- Kirby >>

Ha Ha!  Great post, Kirby.  I live in NYC where I've often seen Yoko and Sean
at the Angelica, a "cine artiste" in Soho.  Your neck of the woods sounds
good to me too.

Madrid was pleasant.  A dash of culture nestled among commercial interests,
but there were several pretty avenues.  Barcelona was--different.  More like
Coney Island than Paris.  It was hyped because of the Olympics, but it's grossly
overrated in my view.  A few impressive museums (Picasso, Miro, History which
contains the ruins of a Medieval city) in what is primarily a beach town.

The Gothic Quarter and La Rambla (the main drag) were a letdown.  La Rambla
is for eating and drinking and little else.  The Gothic Quarter is charming
with lots of narrow streets, but most European cities have narrow streets.  And
again, little to see or do besides shop, buy ice cream and pastries--like that.
 I'm sure there's an intellectual/artistic class, but they stay pretty well
hidden, it seems.  The museums, for example, were sparsely attended.  My wife
and I went to the top of two Cathedrals, one in the Quarter and the other
(Gaudi's unfinished work) merely the husk of a building.  Nice views of the city.
And baroque architecture is everywhere, mingled in with steel and glass.
Still, it's not a beautiful city.  Paris and Venice are beautiful cities.

Barcelona had no government during the Spanish Civil War, and that sense of
anarchy persists.  On paper it sounds good, but living it is another story
altogether.  The airport, for example, posted the wrong gates and times for most
of the flights and the personnel didn't seem aware or concerned.  Our flight
back to NYC was posted on the departures list as going to Tangiers.  Another
example:  a surprise holiday for some saint.  The museums announced that they
would be open, as they are on Sundays.  Half of them weren't.  Lots of pissed off
tourists from Germany and Italy.  But this sort of thing seems typical.  You
go on your nerve, as O'Hara said.

What I remember most about Barcelona is the noise level.  The citizens live
life at the top of their lungs.  Everywhere you go it sounds like three million
plates endlessly crashing to the floor.  Not a place for contemplation.  The
energy seems directed mostly outward.  I think I found Bataille's accursed
share.

There was an experimental music festival in one of the Plazas.  I found it
boring.  The same old same old--bass heavy disco beats drenched in electronics.
Nothing original there.  The Museum of Contemporary Art is closed for the
month of June, so we missed whatever avant-garde brilliance lurks within.

I guess I sound sort of negative about Barcelona.  Ha Ha!  But so many visits
to London and Paris and Venice and Amsterdam have spoiled me.  I expected
more from Barcelona since, like you, I heard it's the PLACE.  It ain't, at least
not for me.  New York City, London and Paris are THE PLACES.  Of course if
clubs and drinking et al are someone's thing, then the city may be just what
s/he's looking for.  You say you like peace and quiet.  In that case Barcelona
would be a living hell for you.

Barcelona's local government has announced that they will begin working
toward making the city a major cultural mecca in 2004.  So I missed the good stuff
by one year.  Then again, on Barcelona time 2004 probably means 2024.  Haaa!
There's much more to say, but I'm trying to forget.  Just kidding.

For all this my wife and I had a good time together.  We always do, no matter
where we are.  Next year it's back to London and Paris, by gum!

Best, Bill

Hi Chris - I tried to access the archives dates, a couple of them on your
blog site, and "they" said that they could not be downloaded.

Anyway - current week - that's a good and heavy Toronto Alley poem - hard.

Otherwise prepping inside to give reading at Elizabeth Robinson's on June
26/ A little trepidatious, have not publicly read in a bit.

Went ten miles in canoe down Russian River yesterday - hot, green and
beautiful. A little burnt here and there.  And now back to real work (grhh).
Hate Mondays.

Aaron, once they settle this boardroom squabble over what
absolutely-necessary ingredient is required for a Leninburg with onions,
even the slogan All power to McDonald's! will be (if it isn't already)
outdated. Come the day, not even a necromancer will be capable of discerning
whether Pound's much-anticipated sepulchral roll at the news indicates
satisfaction or displeasure. Some mediums I know swear Pound still isn't
speaking. But what is the cost of silence? McDonald's execs need to factor
an answer into their final decision. So basically, we're fucked. They're
channeling Winston Smith.

around some years when autumn dies -
at last watch-happy as you! - you'll be, or
someone's, outside the thinking-split morning
someone thinking rolls little decomposed thoughts,
where again clouds' {crowds' ?} afterthoughts are, like,
nothing much.  etc.  etc. ... pinprick of grown hours ...
groan hours? ours? "now happily smoke"
was to be my next line, "smoke" being
a noun, as you would've been able to tell
from the context, but I feel as though I've
written that line before. so I'll tell you something
that has happened before - a couple of nights ago
I had a dream where one room I was in
was filled with what was either blood or wine
splattered, or spilled, painted, on the floor, walls, &
ceiling. the next room met me with a row of
OUTSIZED LEOPARDS wearing crowns. they ALL
spoke to me in one voice but I couldn't catch
what they were saying, which is how I knew it was a dream.
when I left the room I was outside, whereupon
dozens of snakes pooled around me. when one serpent
reared back & struck at me, I woke up, & wrote, immediately,
"who buzzes their generous way, waiting, is over-priced obscurity"

this could be subtitled confessions of a former Freudian but Arthur Modell's
_Imagination and the Meaningful Brain seems to offer a cognitive lakoffian
way out of the prison of language via Edelman and Lakoff & Co. ~ Polanyi
"meaning is in some unknown fashion potentially present as a latent
property...metaphor is primarily a form of cognition...[grounded in] an
'experiential structure' [as the] selective interpreter of corporeal
experience...[and] different domains of the mind/brain operate in accordance
with dufferent 'rules.'...the construction of meaning requires the use of
emotions and feelings as markers of value....By means of metaphor, feelings
can be imaginatively interpreted, displaced, and transformed...consciousness
of feelings may constitute a 'protoself' or a 'biological self' that
functions as a monitor of homeostasis and consciousness of somatic
boundaries so that self and nonself can be distinguished" and on to some
speculations but recommended for summer reading which reminds me we haven't
yet seen our summer reading lists yet?

The Bird


Today Azure and I walked by a school-yard and she found a sick or wounded
pigeon, its legs loose and unable to function, flopping in the grass,
unable to fly - what to do - if it had remained there, it would have been
quite possibly tortured by the children. Azure wrapped the bird in a piece
of cloth and we took it back to the loft, where we put it in a box, gave
it some small pieces of bread, which it didn't eat, and covered it again.
Azure took the bird into the back garden, which is isolated from both
stray cats and the street, and right now, in the dark, it's huddled down
there, in a towel-nest, surrounded by bread-crumbs, with a shallow cup of
water nearby. It can't fly, its legs are paralyzed. It's the saddest
little thing. We don't know what to do. We're going to Pennsylvania, to my
father's house, in three days.  We're trying to keep it alive. Tomorrow,
Azure will call Audubon, and we might also take it to the vet. We can't
afford anything - we're dependent on their willingness to help. We will
try to find a wildlife rehabilitator. I doubt the bird will ever fully
heal. If it's sick, we don't know if it's dangerous to us as well. Azure
talked about keeping it here in the loft in a cage, but that's really
impractical. Right now I'm typing upstairs, and down in the garden,
suffering is ongoing. Buddhism has never helped my rage against the world
and its pain, exacerbated as always by human rapacity. We're trapped until
tomorrow. We hope the bird makes it through the night. If it does, we
don't know what we'll do.

Well, if you want to look through the glass real darkly, try the above
article today in the New York Times on conditions at Quantanamo Prison. It
made me ill, ashamed, and angry - yet I am not sure where to direct the
anger.
I did see Senator Carl Levin's Press Conference on the manipulation of
intelligence. He manages to be a gentleman and twist the Administration's
neck at the same time. I am going to look up his Senate web site and send
him my applause. I think that's important to get rolling as much as possible
in his direction.

I suspect there is a direct correlation between what we have not known about
in the way of actual conditions at Quantanamo from the point of view of the
prisoners and the prevarication on most levels - including so called WMD
"intelligence" on Iraq - of this Administration.

No lie left behind, so to speak.

Thanks for this, Ron!  I enjoyed the links.  The interview with Spencer
Reese ("shop steward king") was beyond belief.  The guy's bio--prep
school, Harvard divinity, George Herbert studies in England, 'centered'
years on rich family's bird preserve, breakdown & hospitalization, the
Brooks Brothers job to keep him "right sized"--must've been computer
generated by the magazine's editors.  Ron's recent comments re: the
traditionalist's peculiarly limited tradition never seemed more right
on.  Reese's story is interesting, but I'm baffled to think of people
clucking their tongues approvingly, like the besotted interviewer, and
thinking "Ah, how poetic!"

But I have to admit, I kind of liked the poem.  Not willingly--the
bullying triads ("muscled, groomed and cropped";  "tattersall, French
cuff and English spread collars"), the cheap cliched treatment of the
pitiable "old faggot" and the suave, Eliotic melancolia Reese actually
cops to in the interview all marked this as a guilty pleasure.  But the
poem for me had that 'nice & easy' quality familiar from certain kinds
of cocktail jazz--as elegant and pleasantly forgettable as a Erroll
Garner solo.  Or, to stick with the poem's central eucharistic image,
it had the sharp, cloying shock of a breath mint:  shallow but sort of
fun to roll around the tongue.  Did anyone else feel this reading the
poem?  I was reminded of the little nagging bell that sometimes goes off
in my head at that useful phrase "School of Quietude."  I'm disjunctive
as the next guy, but is quietude *always* such a bad thing?  Or is it
like the gauzy lenses in old-time glamour shots, the right tool for
certain moods? (or is this the wrong dichotomy completely?)  Come on,
folks, set me straight on this one.  I was surprised (and a little
ashamed) to feel the frisson the poem pushed me so hard to attain.
Darth Vader's breathing heavy with Altoids and Benson & Hedges on his
breath.  Save me from the dark side!

Tom & List,

Yes, where are the booklists?
Well, here are a few books I'd recommend and a few books already on my reading list:

1) "Noise Water Meat: A History of Sound in the Arts" by Douglas Kuhn - MIT Press
- I just finished this. An amazing listening of 20th century avant-garde. It's a bit of a tome, but easy to read (aside from one or two clunky sentences).

2) "Architectural Body" by Madeline Gins and Arakawa -- University of Alabama Press (Poetics Series)
- Impossible to encapsulate in one sentence... Further to discussions on embodied minds, they theorize the sentient body that is at once organism, person, and environment. Don't let prejudices against immortality stop you from reading this book.!

3) Writing Aloud: The Sonics of Language edited by Brandon LaBelle & Christof Migone - errant bodies
- I haven't read this yet. Looks like a promising essay in there from Alvin Lucier.

4) Site of Sound: Of Architecture & the Ear edited by Brandon LaBelle & Steve Roden - errant bodies
- This too, is waiting to be read.

5) Eunoia by Christian Bok - Coachhouse Books
- Well, ok, it came out some time ago, but it's really a wonderful book.

Louis: I'd say, no, we're not fucked (in the bad way) by
any McDonald's final solution. Quietism from poets is a
minor problem. I'm a little surprised by it here on this
Buffalo Poetics List given all that jabbering that went on
around 9*11. No reply to Taylor Brady's comments on
overproduction or to Jonathan Skinner's demands. But, you
know, poets don't have so much in common do they, here,
inside this? The Homeland Security is frightening, I
suspect, to many folks living under the legislation of
"possible threat." I myself already have at least two
intelligence files opened up (Vancouver Police Department,
Canadian Security and Intelligence Service). But that's
partly because I need to generate a specific set of
interpellative documents as part of an ongoing
counter-interpellative writing project, setting aside
whatever suspect community politics I may be tangentially
involved in. Remember the "We are all Rushdie" campaign?
We should concoct some contemporary equivalent that takes
the heat off our friends on the front lines of the class
war.

The Leninburg with onions will be the first verticle hamburger (achieved
largely by changing the bun's shape) -- perverse unwitting testament to
Tatlin, possibly even bizarre symbolic compensation via the gustatory tract
for the 'scraper's demise. They anticipate (not just with overconfidence,
but with its correlate in mind, market stability) that its release might
precipitate the hotdog shape's obsolescense. Most products will have become
flat and/or round by then – in actuality, a technophilic ruse of
consumer-friendly design. Flatness and roundness began to take on
*discursive* shapes starting in the early years of this decade, when the
"soft hit of the personal" became an implicit presupposition of how to
consume on poetry listservs and in poetry blog-chat. Just a poke at this
"the new friendly" would expose, with brutal immediacy, an interior of
vicious social reaction, unthought in extremis parading as hipster's cool.

great that you mention Tatlin--I am wondering if
anyone has seen the Malevich show at the Guggenheim
and has anything to say about it. I am anxious to
travel in and see it.

Joel, if you want to have some odd not particularly great, but I guess
informative, anthropological thrills, plug the Coleridge line into Google.
It's not exactly the afternoon TV soaps, but close. I was trying to help you
out, but I never did get to any biblio information (no patience), but God
was mostly close at every click of the mouse!

"but what these monkeys were doing struck me as extremely primitive compared
to say drawing up the Bill of Rights. Plus you did say that the real world
does exist."
I think of places in consciousness from which one sometimes must at all
costs fend off "language" and quite vigilantly "watch" both feeling and
internal dialogue.  I'm referring to quiet and determined generation of
awareness and "study/observation" whence one steadfastly and perhaps
courageously "chooses" between conflicting and habitual split-second
interchanges between feelings and desires and words and "selves," employing
one's most determined will to sort out and to "decide" who or what inside
(including introjects of others' will that one "be" a self that they have
"mirrored") will be given sway.  This kind of act, for me, anyway, does
nowadays take on increasingly less reliance on or even trust in "language."
Indeed, I want often to almost destroy every "voice in my head" and negate
or just plain nip in the bud any and all impulses to distract myself by
attempting to ("once removed"?) dally in words.
Again, it's a very quiet and perhaps quieting act.  A lot of times it's
preceded by the laying out of paper and pen, and then they seem like such
annoying relics and interferences.  No, not "writer's block," truly, No.
I'm losing the train of thought now, or whatever it was, and/or switching to
another: how much of the world is presently overstimulated by and drowning
in all manner of verbiage, images, media, words, "communication," and
assorted other opiates of inauthenticity, propaganda, bullshit, lies,
mind-control, garbage?  I am, myself, prone to attention disordering and
(ADD?) terrible habits of "starting" infinite things and finishing almost
nothing.  I can barely go two days in a row focusing on the same "project."
A personal problem, to be sure, but also a condition of the everyday world,
I think.  There's way too much garbage and "misuses" and "abuses" of
"language," and for me, anyhow, a seemingly life-or-death choice between
succumbing to all of "that out there" or disciplining myself to choose and
focus, particularly through these rough years until I can get enough _______
to escape it all, maybe move to Mexico, and gain one good shot at rebirth.
Or something like that.

wing muscles were incredibly weak. There was nothing more we could do; it

"Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of the brain is still an
experimental technology that permits direct visualisation of the brain
regions that are active in real time, while the subject is performing a
given task.
I have been creating Functional Portraits by imaging the brain function of
the model, while performing a task that characterises herself or himself. I
have been using fMRI equipment more powerful than the ones used for medical
diagnosis in order to achieve better images. Among the first portraits I
have been producing are "Patricia" with her brain activity while playing the
piano, and a self-portrait with my own brain function while drawing.
As a development of Functional Portraits, I am now planning to paint the
brain by manipulating its activity. With the knowledge of the brain regions
that are activated by certain tasks or stimuli, it is possible to design a
number of simultaneous tasks and stimuli that will achieve a complex brain
activity pattern. In other words, by planning a defined set of tasks it is
possible to "paint" a defined pattern of brain activity. Although the
artwork has a short lifespan - as long as the subject is performing the
tasks - it is possible to document it by means of fMRI. It is a case where
it becomes possible to create art by simple thought."- Marta de Menezes from

Subject:      Colombia: Emergency Strike: 19 June 2003
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"; format="flowed"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

General Strike on 19th June - 'Do or Die' for Colombian
Trade Unions

Colombia's three union centres, the CUT, the CGTD and the
CTC, have called an emergency general strike against
privatisations for next Thursday, 19th June. The stoppage
was announced from Geneva, where the presidents of the
union federations are attending the annual conference of
the International Labour Organisation. The Colombian
unions are demanding that the ILO votes this week to send
an international Commission of Enquiry to Colombia.

The trigger for this action was the announcement last
Thursday night by Telecommunications Minister Marta Pinto
de Dehart that the government is liquidating state
telecommunications corporation TELECOM. An immediate
consequence will be the sacking of up to ten thousand
workers. And the company replacing TELECOM will be ready
to sell off its assets, including to the foreign
multinationals that have been trying to take over the
sector.

Decisive pressure came from Washington. As Miguel Caro
CUT's Director for the public sector points out: "the US
has insisted as a condition for including Colombia in the
Free Trade Area of the Americas negotiations that
one-sided 'shared risk' contracts signed with US companies
be implemented".

The misnamed 'shared-risk' contracts were of course
nothing of the sort, merely a mechanism for foreign
multinationals to rip off the state sector. Back in 1993
TELECOM signed contracts with six multinationals to
provide 2 million telephone lines. They put 1.8 million
lines in place, but only 1.15 million were sold. While the
investment came from state funds, the 'shared risk' meant
that the multinationals were guaranteed an income
irrespective of the number of lines sold. NORTEL and the
other companies demanded a US $2 billion contract
settlement. The previous Colombian government offered $600
million, but this was not enough for NORTEL who lobbied
the US Congress to block any general trade and investment
agreements until its demands are met. Uribe has accepted,
hence the liquidation and sell off which, according to
Miguel Caro "shows once again the submission of the
Colombian government to the dictates of US imperialist
power".

Other unions across the whole state sector, from Bogotá's
telephone corporation ETB, to the agrarian reform
institute INCORA, to the universities and further
education institution SENA, to several health and social
security agencies, are facing privatisation. Uribe has
pledged to push this programme through to meet IMF demands
to halve the fiscal deficit. In practice this means
eradicating the limited social gains of Colombia's 1991
Constitution. The unions who are fighting to maintain
their public services are doing so for the benefit of all
Colombians.

To realise what is now at stake, the plight of the unions
has to be located as part of the broader scenario of
dispossession and repression of the Colombian people.
Alexander Lopez, the former president of public services
union SINTRAEMCALI who was elected as a Social and
Political Front representative to Congress last year,
warns that, "The result of this policy is the elimination
of the public function of the State, leading to misery,
general degradation and conflict".

Life in countryside areas is an unimaginable nightmare.
Civilian populations are being marauded by the army often
disguised as, or working in close co-operation with,
paramilitary forces. The paramilitaries roam freely in
North Tolima and Choco, leaving behind a trail of village
massacres and disappearances. On 5th June Tirso Velez, a
left wing poet and former mayor of Tibu was assassinated.

But it is in the remote oil rich north-eastern department
of Arauca that the human rights violations are the most
acute right now, as reported to Amnesty International UK's
annual conference by Samuel Morales, CUT's organiser in
the region who also works with social and human rights
organisations. For the last two months three hundred
Guahíbo indigenous people from Tame have occupied the
Central Catholic Church in Saravena. They fled their homes
as a result of attacks committed by the Nava Pardo
Battalion of the 18th Brigade of the National Army. On
31st December soldiers wearing AUC armbands came to
Betoyes village. They killed a man and took off his two
year old daughter. They raped four females aged 11, 12, 15
and 16 years old. Omaira Fernández was pregnant. Then, as
human rights workers report, 'the people had to look on
horrified as the supposed "paramilitaries" opened up her
womb, took out the foetus, sliced it up, put the pieces in
a plastic bag and threw them into the river along with the
mother'.

Tame is situated between three zones being taken over by
US corporation Occidental, the Spanish multinational
Repsol, and BP whose expanding Casanare operation is
moving northwards towards Tame.

Welcome to Uribe's Colombia - a heavy hand on the poor but
a kind heart for the multinationals.

Uribe is working hard to get international support for his
project to criminalise popular resistance. Francisco
Cortés, a leader of the ANUC-UR peasant organisation in
the Arauca region is a well known human rights campaigner
who visited Britain two years ago. Subsequently 'Pachito'
visited fellow peasant movements in Bolivia, but on 10th
April he was detained in La Paz, accused of being in both
the FARC and ELN guerrillas. Today he is imprisoned
without trial in a 8ft square cell, 10 to 15 degrees below
zero, at 4,000 metres above sea level.

While the whole movement is under threat, the militant
wing of Colombian trade unions that identifies with
popular struggles has been the most targeted. 90% of
assassinated trade unionists are members of CUT-
affiliated unions. The rate of assassination of Colombian
has decreased, with only (!) thirty murdered in the first
five months of this year. Perhaps with so much
international attention on this aspect, somebody somewhere
decided that Uribe has to be seen to be improving the
situation. Certainly, the modes of paramilitary and state
terror are evolving, but the danger is ever present.
Families are now being systematically targeted. Last week
a flood of graffiti appeared in the city of Cali, with
slogans declaring "DEATH to SINTRAEMCALI", "SINTRAEMCALI =
THIEVES" and "SINTRAEMCALI = GUERRILLA".

Many more trade unionists are being detained. Five members
of the oil workers union USO who have been under house
arrest for a year and a half go on trial this week.

Uribe's government is backtracking on commitments made by
previous governments to provide physical protection for at
least some of the most targetted trade union leaders.
Domingo Tovar, the Director of CUT's Human Rights
Department whose two daughters have been threatened is one
of those at the highest risk. He is battling to keep his
own bodyguards as officially recognised self-defence. The
Ministry of Interior wants to replace them with Department
of Security agents. The difference is a life or death
matter for Domingo.

Meantime Uribe is offering the AUC, Colombia's principal
paramilitary outfit, pardon and immunity from prosecution
as part of a deal to bring them into negotiations. This
move is calculated to encourage the death squads.

There is a chilling logic to Uribe's elimination
programme. With private sector unions virtually
non-existent, the Colombian trade union movement has
arrived at its 'do or die' moment.

It will take enormous pressure from within and without to
halt the march of fascism in Colombia. The CUT Human
Rights Department has called for solidarity, highlighting
the need for mobilisation of protest internationally and
physical accompaniment in Colombia.

On the first front, Tony Blair is convening an
international governmental conference in London on 10th
July to build support for Uribe's regime. We in Britain
have a special responsibility to mount united protest
against the Blair-Uribe axis, and for human rights aid to
go to trade unionists and the oppressed in Colombia. Look
out for further announcements.

Sophonisba :  the first view offers the scenario

Hulbeck (follows Sophonisba) :  your masked turn


the scene follows Sophinisba’s exit

Masinissa :  & I have built childbirth under
                          a portable language

Syphax :  broken key & portable language
                          the epidermis thick with knocking

Masinissa :  distinguished founder, grown fictitious
                          by boasting, known for the same answer

Syphax :  said dramatically to be holding that sea
                          Jack Sheppard hanged in 1724

Jack Sheppard :  after two Newgate escapes, mind you


Sophonisba daughter of Hasdrubal

Syphax :  Alexander Smith chances for the throne

Scipio :  poetry twice the length of prose, and so
                         the lawful comforts flooded with scenario

Hulbeck :  your masked town follows exits out


Syphax :  missing successor his whole shepherdess,
                          the Pallas of metrical reservation

Sophonisba diffused in more sensible imprisonment


Jack Sheppard :  mortal breath had not been her sister

Syphax :  cheek represents them as the requital

Sophinisba :  broken key that has sagging light

The Numidians :  imagined a wide berth his natural child

money

Sophonisba turned that quarrel to take the eye

Laelius :  thy death marked neglected diligence

Syphax :  Alexander Smith chances for the age
                                    whose cue it was to sink it

Laelius :  I am drowning, which cannot be perceived

Jack Sheppard and the hours become the property of antique accord


scene runs the risk for the casting

Masinissa :  threaten my own lips in return for more time

Sophonisba answered loudly after that lapse had cost you

Hulbeck :  all that to keep them from a long night

Scipio :  a good frame of mind holds my tongue
                           to that effect, and I had to call each

Masinissa :  he wished me insignificant, and would have

Scipio :  derivative though largely noncommittal
                           let him speak for himself, axiomatics apart

Hulbeck :  so on to the heart of a little bell

Scipio :  the letter will disappear, rebus ipsis, as
                            will this scene

the Numidians call Sophonisba by the name Saphanba’al, to no avail, and
Massinissa sends her poison in a cup

Sophonisba :  metaphors oblivious to what is made witness

Syphax :  this tyranny melted down in a foundry

Laelius :  the dead are in flames, gnawing cold

Masinissa :  revision of the wrecked suggestion

Scipio :  the previous vengeance as shown, in fact,
                            once she had shown a new habit

Sophonisba :  lost, the pleasure was no exception, attempted
                             in twenty-four hours, excused a new toy

Alexander Smith highly in exile from the outside

Syphax :  antithesis ingenious, made from the public, and, as
                             referee, a neutral disappointment


Jack Sheppard :  Saphanba’al with careless furtherance
                                  playing at fastened courtesy

Wanton Scripture :  fault shot through the strand
                                       poisoned cup the breast of the wolf

Alexander Smith :  a little spice is welcome, repair
                                        this wrong at vehement cost

Sophonisba :  treason to diverse bonds, fresh to the table
                                        in one person, one grave

the Numidians then raise a cry of perjury

Scipio :  beastliness suddenly restores my sight, I see

moon

Sophinisba :  superstition the dust in the street, conclude
                                         them to drink their fill

Masinissa :  harbor such a work for all love, surfeited
                                          at its source, blood won in war


Hulbeck :  Ignatius swam well, Huncamunca sank

Laelius :  like a stone, all alone. The window
                          lends me such manner, slung a place at her side

Syphax :  no picture that uncompromising, floating on the way

Laelius :  from want drooped by fresh clouds

Syphax :  in earnest, draped by fearful asides, a quick
                          eye who waited for them, keeping her goodwill

Hulbeck :  remorse astir wildly ‘round their hands


Jack Sheppard :  O musing meantime! Musing meantime O!

                                       sympathy set to rights, no one if you
wish

Scipio :  but for a month, a quick glance was impossible
                                        again and again I implore you for a
thunderclap

Laelius :  ministry having won exultation

Scipio :  ministry deceived by never-dying plot

Jack Sheppard : today I discover musing meantime

Hulbeck :  the ruse upholds the dead body, roamed
                                         about her entreaties, ear and eye
to and fro

Laelius :  gesticulation was over, adjoining arrival

Jack Sheppard :  O musing meantime! Musing meantime O!

Scipio :  mercurial screech, manhandled fact, Atlantis
                                         came up to par, the same steps
expect the same decorum


Masinissa :  such behavior receives their defense, I have
                                         entitlement to the charms the rest
pass on

Sophonisba :  young gentlemen did it for free, scrupled
                                          emolument, the least of these had
perhaps recovered

Wanton Scripture :  misfortune to submit thirty notwithstandings

Masinissa :  & I have built childbirth under
                                          a portable language, the payment
of nature gets
                                          the better of her, & ill

Laelius :  moiety a moiety of moiety, as all thought is
                                          thought in thought

Sophinisba :  a few hour’s sleep in fashion, such
                                           perfections would offer no
account

Wanton Scripture :  good news to draw description


Alexander Smith :  blitzed drop-offs on the best of
                                             terms, indolent vertigo showed
up compromise

For Steve Tills,

I'm against the idea of moving out of the culture with enough money to escape it
all, although I sympathize.  I think the job should be to put the shoulder to
the wheel, as Ginsberg said -- and be a citizen in our communities.  That's why
I'm also against Rimbaud as a model of the poet.  I like much better WCW.  He
functioned.  But I am sympathetic and can understand feeling like one has had
it.  The idea of a one-shot rebirth is a concern to me, too -- I don't think
these things exist -- but again -- I wish they did.  I see the work of being a
citizen as being slow, and vegetable-ish -- rhizomatic, maybe.

I want to be a potato.  I don't know how else to couch it.  It seems to me that
this is what Paris, London, and some smaller towns in America get out of their
citizens.


WCW or Loraine Niedecker or Charles Reznikoff seem like good models.  People who
stay put.  Even Charles Olson, I guess, though he didn't really seem to function
in Gloucester.  He got money from outside Gloucester, or maybe he stole his
money from Black Mountain, as Clark suggests in the bio.  But the idea of a poet
as a person who works in a community seems great.  I often wish I had trained as
a plumber, or a refrigerator repairman.

I understand the breaks in your language-grasp -- Deleuze calls this stuttering,
and praises it.  I'm not sure about the place of this.  Language it still seems
to me ought to connect with the place you're writing in, as part of the ecology.

I'm chairing a panel on Literature and Food at the SUNY-Cortland literature
conference from October 26-28, 2003.

My topic is: Good Taste at the Dinner Table: Papers that address the aesthetics vs.
the ethics of eating.

This is an idea I gleaned from Corso while writing my book about his work.  That
eating is always unethical, but often aesthetic.

That is, it is wrong to eat other creatures, but they might be tasty, so it is good,
in another sense.

I am particularly interested in 20th century American poets and how they address the
topic of food from within those parameters.  Is it ethical to eat other creatures?
In Pound, for instance, there is the famous remark about how Yeats' one great
contribution was the discovery of a moderately priced chop house.

In WCW, you have the famous poem about eating plums.  It is somehow unethical of him
to take the plums that his wife was saving, but they tasted delicious.

What I need are three fifteen-minute papers.  One on Paul Blackburn would seem
especially relevant, since he died at Cortland in the early seventies.  I don't have
any papers or abstracts yet.  I need to get them by July 15th.

It's a great conference -- about an hour north of Binghamton, NY and about an hour
south of Syracuse -- it is only 15 minutes or so from Ithaca -- which houses the
strange hybrid campus of Cornell -- with its motley collection of great buildings.
The campus at Cortland is more or less institutional, and I don't know downtown
Cortland at all -- but in the other close-by cities there's lots to do.  Usually
about a thousand people come to this conference, and some even come from India and
Great Britain.

Look at the SUNY-Cortland English Department web page for more details.  There are
also about sixty other panels to choose from.  This one on food is very
well-attended, and they try to place it just before dinner time -- which is
sumptuous, and has good entertainment.  Last year there were fifty people at this
conference, so it's a good showcase for talent.

I want to get three people interested in contemporary American poetry to be on the
panel.  We can have dinner together after the panel and gossip and network.

RE: "I often wished I'd trained as a plumber, or a refrigerator =

TOLEDO, OH: Mr. LaVoy is up to his shoulders in the freezer, thawing & =
draining the plugged line, turning off the defroster timer, stripping =
ice & prying washers and gaskets from the lining of the malfunctioning =
refrigerator, saying absolutely nothing, which is his =
understated-to-the-point-of-mute, efficient manner. Removed pieces lined =
in a row -- screws, tubing, shelf brackets, coils, a bath towel catching =
the spills. When an appliance goes down, and after I poke stupidly about =
some with an inappropriate tool, he gets a call and a few hours later =
his outfitted van pulls in the drive. Somehow I doubt he'd savvy the =
work of a poet. But as a refrigerator repairman he's masterful, =
in-and-out for $72.78, an undoubtedly fair price for a skilled =
tradesman's services. JL

This is taking an interesting twist.  I've just gotten an invite to spend a
week at the neuropsych/drug/research triangle for IBS at UNC which might be
within shouting distance of BLack Mountain and there might be reading
opportunities?  I may also this fall be returning to Niedecker land?

Which brings up the question, if you don't pay attention to theoretical
capitals where is the poetry in this country being written?

I suggest that Gary Snyder is an excellent model for community involvement
by a poet, and work that sprouts from a local ecology.

Kazim, potatoes in babyland will enjoin sockeye brethren to betroth woolly
tribes from the Cas, Nads, and Das, who will have encoded a Mormonizer as
continental shield, ethereal double of the Canadian Shield -- and just when
the Shield begins sliding into the California plate. Cheques bouncing off
this shield -- "like umpires off empires," as the saying will have it --
will be written on invented currencies taxed by poet-chieftans (who will
have become renown as "fierce penny-ante accountants"), while a 5%
laughing-gas mixture, pumped under the shield from 10,000-feet-high tubes,
restores thermodynamic balance to global weather patterns and cultivates a
gustatory "sociodynamics of cutlery" in the human oikos. Laughing will have
become a phonemic octave diligently Nelson rated by the Pittsburgh Institute
of Mortuary Science -- hiring Ilya Zbarsky, Lenin's embalmer, as head
composer. Rolling will become a sport among a sect of potato-eating
neoneoPlatonists -- who will lose their tv license after three episodes,
regaining it back as pure form, that, broadcasted, will sometimes jam the
Mormonizer to the delight of potatoes in babyland.

Dear Louis: You make several excellent points in your
correspondence of 17 & 18 June 2003. However, I find the
overall tone to be speculative in nature. Whatever
happened to Richard Rorty anyhow? Remember late '93 when
he used to blow into town and attract of crowd of 3 or 4
thousand? They had to use overflow rooms and pipe his
image in through video--I think it was that funny speech
inflaming graduate students and even the general public
everywhere to go kookoo over Habermasian liberalism. But
just backing up for a moment: was your explanation to the
US residents on this list really necessary re: Robyn
Matthieus? Context is for chumps. JD knew that back in '79
(see his 2 poems in the Douglas College journal--Jason
Wiens will have a copy). Do you mean to say "Nelson"
instead of "Neilson"? That would open this up to a very
unpleasant public exchange that you know damn well we are
already too far into to desist from! I apologize for being
a stickler but five percent nitrous oxide isn't any good
for me or GP. May as well just blow in and out of a paper
bag while cradling your testicles, which isn't so bad
either. The Canadian Shield has nothing to do with this,
by the way, and I sort of resent that you and all those
people east of the Continental Divide think they can just
conflate our tectonics at will as though geology was a
brach of government. Some of these questions are treated
in my most recent work, "vidal, terror,afganistan" [sic],
published 29 minutes ago by the Atlanta Journal
Constitution:
http://www.iath.virginia.edu/~luoma/peace/hist/adir/DmWaVECAxeaWVx.html

Please let me know if this answer is sufficient.

Yours truly,
Aaron Vidaver

I agree with you, actually.  My own fantasy of "moving to Mexico" is
probably only that, a fantasy (though it "sustains me" at times and I would
like to try it if I could some day for a year or so, as I am very little
traveled and have not ever really lived outside of the U.S. and more than
anything else I've been pretty beat here for the last few years, regularly
pine for and fantasize "an escape," a respite from "here," etc).  But I
understand, and essentially agree with, your sentiment about the expatriot
thing.  The part about "neglecting" to stay put and fight or at least
survive alongside others who are not or cannot "run away," as it were.
(By the by, "enough ____" is not necessarily "enough money," actually.  In
my case, it's, ummm, "spunk" or "guts," too, maybe mostly.  As for "money,"
well, Mexico, particularly Baja, so as to enter/re-enter California (where
I'd really like to escape "back to"), is the "fantasy" because of an
illusion that it'd permit low cost living.  Blah blah blah...)

Why can't we talk about America's poetry hotspots if we want? What are
some fruitful locales besides those in big cities like New York?

I'd like to take a poet's tour of America. Maybe I could film it and sell out
to the Poetry Network on basic cable.

I'd suggest that local is global and global is local. Ultimately - if one's
feet are fully on the ground - there is no way out of the "sleeve".
Niedecker's farmers - the way the local language is spoken - are as much
impacted by international markets as are their bank accounts. Such as true,
as well, with the Thai or Mexican farmer. Locally, where I am here in San
Francisco, the color of fruit and vegetables in the supermarkets are
dictated now by international seasons - in the winter the color of peaches
are New Zeeland and in the summer, at the farmer's market we have the
usually tender bodied local Central Valley organic peaches versus the
rubbery "survive all markets" corporate peaches.
As a result the eye now registers and deal with a much more diverse lexicon
and what the brain/tongue follow with in the way of spoken vocabulary is
much more variegated than our forbears. I find this "manner of globalism"
extrinsically exciting - and I suspect Niedecker would have also
Which is all of a way of saying that there is no leave taking, no more than
Rimbaud in Arabia was free - but someone forced to find means to cope to
survive  the Arab interface with Europe's imperial circuitry.

I do think, however, this thread is touching on a kind of citizen-limbo in
which many of us find ourselves. The "local" as traditionally defined -
going to City Counsel meetings, for example - often seems a hopelessly
counter-poetic event from which many of us have privileged ourselves into
thinking our participation is irrelevant as either citizens and/or poets.
And it could be that in many cities, the professional urban planners, etc.
have done what they can to exclude citizen participation, as well. Our
involvement in a professional identity as poets(which is mostly a financial
joke) or any other identity keeps one out of civic play.  My dad as member
of the "old school" at 91 still dutifully goes to Monday night City Counsel
meetings and speaks often and - when things are totally off the hook and
corrupt - he tells me, "I have been around long enough to find it
entertaining."
On an international level - where one is either the beneficiary or victim of
decisions made in corporate or corporate controlled rooms - participation in
making such decisions even seems more remote, certainly remote from the
concept of government by the consent of the governed.
So here many of us are in limbo - which might have been what Bob Marley was
singing to.  How to make a vibrant and somehow "useful"  language that
reaches out of aesthetic and all the other contingent/related limbos is
maybe one way to look at the struggle - or the hook in the thread here. Once
you've done that - perhaps - wherever you plant your feet is "home".

Dear Listserv:

Of all things tonight on Chicago television they aired a commercial for =
'Saudi Arabia.' This bit of propaganda touted not the people of Saudi =
Arabia but the Saudi gov't as our dear friends. Knowing this...that the =
Saudi gov't is my dear friend I will wake up tomorrow morning--nay I =
shall leap from bed--ecstatic that these friends across the waters have =
been our partners in the fight against terrorism all along. Who knew? I =
hope you'll see this ad and feel enlightened as I do now. This =
commercial is now my favorite. The ads for 'beef' and 'cheese' and =
'milk' pale in comparison. The final image of the huge cellular phone =
towering over Mecca is truly awe inspiring. I can't wait to see the =
advertisement for 'air' that I hear is in the works. Remember trees? =
They were beautiful weren't they?

Yours sincerely,
Larry Sawyer

Dear Fellow Poets,

Tired of going to after-reading parties and feeling left out during
conversations like:

A: Amitabh Bachchan blah blah blah "Coolie" blah blah blah deep sexy
baritone blah blah blah ...
B: Blah blah blah "International Gorillay" blah blah blah ...
A: Blah blah blah Tumne na jaana ke main deewaana mm hmm hmm blah blah blah
...

Be-in-the-dark no more! Introducing ... The "Annotated Crush List" on
Elsewhere!

Here, in easy-to-read type, illustrated with numerous photographs, you'll be
introduced to a handful of the most popular stars, vamps, playback singers,
and character actors of both Bollywood and Lollywood.

No longer feel like you're "not getting it" when other poets argue endlessly
about who was the greatest vamp: Sandhya or Helen? Cut through those
once-interminable poet-critic dissections of Amitabh Bachchan's career with
your *own* take on the career-arc of Bollywood's brightest star.

"I heard about this movie where Salman Rushdie tries to destroy Pakistan by
opening chains of discos and casinos -- will that be covered?"

"I can't TAKE Lata Mangashkar's syrupy sweet voice anymore ... I just
*can't*!!! Isn't there a *more soulful* playback singer out there?!?"

Find answers to these questions ... and so much more ... in "The Annotated
Crush List" on Elsewhere.

I've heard about TBA on the underground jazz circuit. S'posed to have
monster chops, man. Really knows how to swing the band. Sounds like a
can't-miss gig.

Hi all, just a quick note: there are example poems from the New Yorker Sparrow
Project now up at Mainstream Poetry:

www.mainstreampoetry.com

You are encouraged to take part in this exciting new project!  Just send your
"Sparrow" poem to the New Yorker. (There's a full explanation of the project
below these examples.)

Also: news of Mainstream Poetry has reached Chile:

Mainstream Poetry: mainstreampoetry.blogspot.com

El título es claramente irónico. Algunas ideas buenas y bastante divertidas,
además de reflexiones (o pseudo-reflexiones) sobre la vanguardia. Aquí a menudo
uno se encuentra con intervenciones poéticas, esto es: poemas clásicos
reconfigurados de manera satírica. Muy interesante. --Chile Radio

Thanks to Nick Piombino for pointing this out.

Joel --

I've read some of Gary Snyder's work, and like it very much.  I don't know much
about his life -- I heard him read. He apparently has a large ranch in northern
California.  He read about how his kids sneak up on deer with those children's
bow and arrows with the red suction tips, and try to get one to stick to a
deer.  Those kids are probably grown up now.

What specifically has he done in terms of saving a canyon, or a tree?  I don't
know about this. I know he's generally in favor of nature, but what is he doing
specifically?

I read Joanne Kyger's account of their being in Japan together in the early 60s
and he was always drunk, and once knocked her down and split her face open
because she wouldn't do the dishes.  She got a hundred stitches.  Another time
he kicked her because she told him to please stop singing.  I think this is in
her big book of journals out from some west coast press -- were they called
Japan-India journals?

I don't really know a lot of other stuff about him. He's on the faculty at
UC-Sacramento, I think.  Is this his major source of income?

This is the problem that Steve Tills laid out -- how to get enough money to get
out of the ratrace long enough to think clearly.  Corso's method was to beg,
borrow, and steal.  He never worked to my knowledge.  He married at least one
rich woman, and he had some supporters.  Later in his life he had a patron.  Do
poets still get patrons generally?

I think the main patron is the university for poets these days.  That's all
right, but it puts one someone outside the community.  After reading Joel
Lipman's wonderful description of the plumber with all the tools of the trade
laid out on the floor -- that looks like a very difficult thing to learn.  I
loved the names of all the gadgets he mentioned.  I love going into hardware
stores and looking around.  So many cool gadgets.

But I digress.  The main thing is to get some breathing room, financially.  Of
the New York poets many of them had day jobs, but good ones -- O'HAra as a
curator for MOMA.  Emslie I think was the only genuinely rich guy who nevr had
to work in the NY School.  Clark Coolidge was related to the former president
and had some money left over from that.  Traditionally poets were aristocrats,
or they died young.  Going mad is an option, a la Clare, I suppose, in terms of
getting care and feeding.

Mexico didn't work for Corso.  He tried it, but was disgusted and depressed.
Cheap housing is a solution.  I knew a friend of Burroughs' who went and lived
in a ghost town in Nevada, writing porno to support himself.

All these solutions are so miserable -- but first poets have to get a shelter,
before they can do anything for other people since we have one foot in the realm
of Caesar.

It is easier in some other countries like Canada -- but unless you marry a
Canadian, an American doesn't have the right to live or work there, I don't
believe.

The rural areas are great if you can get a decent job -- much cheaper, and you
can have more space, but I personally miss art museums, science centers, great
libraries, and even meeting strangers.  I'm in a town with only 2000 people, and
it works for us.  But what part does poetry play in this kind of place?  I wrote
a poem about the huge snowfall last December -- four feet in one night -- and in
it mentioned the cop getting stuck, and the neighbor dying of a heart attack as
he shoveled, and a few other incidents, but then realized that if I published
the poem in the town everybody would get mad at me for one reason or another,
and services would stop.

I wonder how Olson managed to be so personal in Gloucester with Ferrini and
others and still get away with it?  There are some tiny papers here that
probably would publish local poems, but the other thing is I kind of like being
invisible.  I would hate to be pointed as the poet.  I think on the other hand
Charles Olson might have liked that.  Maximus is sort of him in a nutshell --
maximizing his self, his deeds, and going head to head with his town, his
culture, Pound, etc.  Maybe all the Beats liked that kind of noisy deal.  Once
in Iowa my grandfather said he was stopped by a traffic jam going into Iowa
City.  It was Allen Ginsberg stopping traffic to hand out his poems.  They had
such enormous personalities, it seems.  Not me: if I wrote under a moniker it'd
be more like Minimus.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact: Michael Szpakowski

Five ‘Small but Perfectly Formed’ Operas for the Internet




In November 2002 Michael Szpakowski, a British composer and new media artist (http://www.somedancersandmusicians.com/michael.html), put out a call on the internet for opera libretti, exactly 100 words in length.

Fifty-one people replied – their work can be seen at

http://www.somedancersandmusicians.com/operaCall/pieces.html



From these 51 pieces Michael chose five for development in this Arts Council and Epping Forest District Council funded project.

Four of the librettists are form the USA and one from the UK.

The subject matter of the pieces varies enormously:

Rob L Roth and Carletta Joy Walker create a hymn to the edible berry in “Smart and Tart Juicing”, Lewis Lacook’s  “Trickle Song” is a strange love song between cup and water, in “Woodland Teratology” Bruce Conkle investigates the Sasquatch legend and in “East Wind” Gordon Phillips adapts a painting by one of the Ashington Group – working class painters active in Northumberland in the 1930s. Finally Zack Sims creates a surreal world in which George Washington, a fox and a hen, muse, play and bicker in “A Short Essay on Imaginary Solitude (With George Washington)”



In January 2003 Michael set these five pieces to music and then rehearsed intensively through February and March with a group of singing students from Epping Forest College as principals and a chorus consisting of year 5 students from Chipping Ongar Primary School.

Far from being a tokenistic “outreach” project this work made serious demands on all the participants, which they passed with flying colours.



Since the musical performances were recorded Michael has been working intensively to create accompanying visuals.

The result is five small but perfectly formed operas of between 1 and 3 minutes in length delivered through the Internet.

The final pieces will appear online on 27th June 2003 at

http://www.somedancersandmusicians.com/5operas.html and will be archived there permanently.



There is a launch event in Epping, Essex at 7 pm on Friday 17th June, when Michael and three of the librettists will be introducing and presenting the works. For an invitation please e-mail

launch@somedancersandmusicians.com

RE: SKILLED TRADES CLARIFICATION

TOLEDO, OH: Not a plumber, Mr. LaVoy is an appliance repairman, lean and =
adroit with his tools and knowledge of their various applications. Stan =
Ganshaw [RIP] was a plumber, imperfectly similar to Mr. LaVoy in his =
tradesman's specific capabilities and perhaps with some overlap of =
technical wisdom and tools in that both men work with water lines, =
though plumbers often handle 1 to 6 inch pipes, drains and traps while =
appliance repair, insofar as water sources are concerned, tends to be =
limited to modest flexible poly and copper tubing. And plumbers have to =
really scootch down, whence their waistbands slip to reveal the =
voyeuristically disgusting plumber's crack, Stan Ganshaw's only =
observable flaw, other than excess weight and a subsequent killer heart =
attack. JL

others and still get away with it?  There are some tiny papers here that
probably would publish local poems, but the other thing is I kind of =
like being
invisible.  I would hate to be pointed as the poet.  I think on the =
other hand
Charles Olson might have liked that.  Maximus is sort of him in a =
nutshell --
maximizing his self, his deeds, and going head to head with his town, =
his
culture, Pound, etc.  Maybe all the Beats liked that kind of noisy deal. =
 Once
in Iowa my grandfather said he was stopped by a traffic jam going into =
Iowa
City.  It was Allen Ginsberg stopping traffic to hand out his poems.  =
They had
such enormous personalities, it seems.  Not me: if I wrote under a =
moniker it'd
be more like Minimus.

Aaron, much like the rest-stop during the federal highway era, facilities
will be set aside, in most pods, for negativity re-training. As in a
Blockbuster nightmare thriller, critique will have become viewed as
self-inflicted and as not informed by collective (let alone language)
practice. Negativity will be found too dangerous for unsupervised individual
use -- leading to dysfunctional hallucinations of the real as made by
"social relations" (obsolete catachresis for poetry -- n.b., now an
accounting profession). The need for re-training will be great, and most
PhDs in literature will be hired by service companies offering this sort of
therapy (university students will buy their time for study by administering
to the thriving street market in nitrous oxide). The following Welshman's
class (metonym for social) caution when inventing a literary life out of
negativity (especially when the writer is not from the United Kingdom), will
have been turned upside-down into a general diagnosis of "negativity
malaise," as if the only class was classless (false prediction too cheerily
spread by an Italian philosopher in 1991 -- bad year for predictions)
wherein The Thing bathes in a self-balancing light: "It is a characteristic
of the negative identification that it breaks up at points of real social
crisis and reacts into an indifference to politics, recantation, or
sometimes violent assault on the cause that has been abandoned." Hegel will
continue to be channeled, and by a young movement indeed (teenagers), but
"[t]he dissimilarity that obtains in consciousness between the ego and the
substance constituting its object . . . the factor of negativity in general"
will have become sublimated into a respectable parlour-game between
computers without parlours (but in apartments with computers). Ontological
investigations will haphazardly continue split into two camps, mathesis
(Badiou) and multitude (Nancy), even as its horizon as such will have
vanished (paradoxically) with a giggle and a burp.

I'm in Seattle/outpost earth/the scotland of america
(my birth city), and, yeah, there is a community here.
There is a group, and it seems in this last year a
growing group of writers doing interesting things (in
addition to the "nature/slam" poets who are a major
part of the Poetry community out here). We've got a
couple of new magazines that are pretty exciting
"Monkey Puzzle" and "Bird Dog."

We have a monthly reading series (SUBTEXT) now in year
(love potion) Number 9.
http://www.speakeasy.org/subtext. The work/poetry
thing is a tough one. I'm pretty lucky right now in
that I work just 32hrs (4 days) and am able to support
myself with my salary (+ my wife's grad student
stipend). Rent can be a little high here. But we live
pretty simply (I can walk to work & to the baseball
park). And, hell, a happy hour pitcher of STRONG HOPPY
PNW BEER can be as low as $7 (rocket fuel).

I do go to NYC a few times a year to "urban recharge"
& see friends (Seattle is a "small town" still in a
lot of ways). But there is a lot going on here as far
as art & film & experimental music.  Saw Acid Mother's
Temple side project show with Kinski for example for
like $8 and had enough space "to float around" the
club for a bit and small-talk with the performers (My
friend Daniel Comisky got everyone who performed to
sign his "ticket"--pas'd probleme).  Nice. & more
energy for me.

And yeah, it is tough not to be bitter/depressed (damn
those winters) about work (the terrible) vs. money vs.
free time (and it is a constant fight -- but I'm kinda
used to it now)  ---and it takes some effort, but my
part time schedule allows me to have the psychic space
to get stuff done, either on my Friday off or by
staying up ‘til 3am on a "work-night" working on my
writing. Though I'm often resentful of this combo life
(work & poetry/life “why can’t I just be rich?” duh!)
but I feel happy at some core level (at least some of
the time) about being able to write and somehow keep
going. I guess the question is how can a writer exist
in a system that is making it increasingly difficult
for a writer to exist at all?   I think, too, it is
difficult for poets who work outside of an Academic
setting to find role models / different ways to live
and thrive that will allow them to be happy with both
their “working” and a poetry lives.  Anyone, else have
a tale from their city?

GENOMICS: NEW SCIENCE IN THE NEW CULTURAL SITUATION

Genomics is a prototype of the coming is on the cutting edge of
"neo-Vesalian" biomedicine and health care of the nearest future. As Victor
McKusik writes: "Specialists in all medical areas will approach the study of
their most puzzling diseases by first mapping the genes responsible for
them. Thus, just as Vesalius's anatomical text of 1543 formed the basis for
the physiology of William Harvey (1628) and the morbid anatomy of Morgagni
(1761), gene mapping is having a widely pervasive influence on medicine."
[1] From this point of view genomics means new imaginative and pragmatic
"localization" of human problems.
Localization constitutes the ground of any human action. In the book The
Normal and The Pathological published in the occupied France in 1943, George
Canguilhem wrote: - "To act, it is necessary at least to localize. For
example, how do we take action against an earthquake or hurricane? The
impetus behind every ontological theory of disease undoubtedly derives from
therapeutic need. When we see in every sick man someone whose being has been
augmented or diminished, we are somewhat reassured, for what a man has lost
can be restored to him, and what has entered him can also leave. We can hope
to conquer disease even if it is the result of a spell, or magic, or
possession; we have only to remember that disease happens to man in order
not to lose all hope. Magic brings to drugs and incantation rites
innumerable resources for generating a profoundly intense desire for cure."

"The Y chromosome is made of a single DNA molecule that is 51 million =
units of DNA in length. Within the chromosome, Dr. Page and his =
colleagues report in Nature today, lie eight vast palindromes, regions =
that carry identical sequences of DNA units that run in opposite =
directions like the letters in the sentence "Madam, I'm Adam."

"By making a hairpin bend in the middle of a palindrome, the two arms =
can be brought together, aligning two long stretches of almost identical =
DNA sequence. That is the same step that precedes recombination between =
the maternal and paternal members of each ordinary chromosome pair, =
which also have almost identical sequences.=20

"In the case of the Y, the alignment of the palindromic sequences leads =
to gene conversion. A mutated gene on one arm of the palindrome can be =
converted to the undamaged sequence preserved on the other arm.

"This narcissistic process of salvation by palindrome seems to be what =
has saved men from extinction so far. It serves at least to =
counterbalance the decay caused by the lack of recombination. But Dr. =
Page and others say it is too soon to say which force is now uppermost."

hi kirby,
can you explain this to me?

It is easier in some other countries like Canada -- but unless you marry a
Canadian, an American doesn't have the right to live or work there, I
don't believe.

This is a great find, Scott. What is a poet now to deduce. Immediately I
thought of a new line of instinctual "palindromic diplomacy" in which
bi-polar country pairs (Turkey/Kurdistan), (Palestine/Israel),
(Northern/Southern California), (Irelands) etc. get their DNA sequences
aligned to be politcally (etc.) so sweetly embraced.

Who knows such diplomacy might be the one thing that saves the entire
species from extinction.

Well, there is still the question of earthquakes and other looming natural
disasters which are not, it seems, palindromatically oriented.

Still, a wonderful find.

Louis, again, fine contributions. Professor Perelman has
asked me to cease from any further inflammation until you
complete your dissertation. Let me thus address but four
quick points in anticipation of no further correspondence
regarding this unfortunate matter. First, tell your little
mid-career buddies that while they were all nodding in
their turtlenecks to that crypto-Feuerbachian Hardt &
Negri stuff, the kids were chowing down upon the
lesser-known Laurence R. Horn's Natural History of
Negation. This was several years after tackling Jenning's
Genealogy of Disjunction in typescript. Remember what
Shania Twain stated on the fifth track of her second
album--that's a lesson not just for Canadians. I don't
think I need to repeat it here. We all know what I'm
talking about. Second, I'm not against castration as a
solution to male violence, but this doesn't always work
with animals. More research needs to be done on the use of
estrogen and progesteron. We need to be systematic about
this; no ad-hockery; no "case-by-case" basis like in the
USA. Third, I do feel that in many respects we're speaking
past one another (Kazim Ali, for instance, asks, with
regards to the Malevich exhibition: "ummm...so...that
means it's *not* a good show?"). Farr's piece on the
conduit metaphor, picking up from Watten and others, makes
some progress insofar as it builds a "hostile informative"
into the communicative model. One way of putting this is
by saying "Let us disagree to disagree." Fourth,
ontological investigations are fun but I notice some slack
in your two messages of 19 June 2003. We are not re-living
the Weimar years Louis!

Warmly,
Aaron

PS--I hid the last of the meth inside the KSW copy of Love
Songs or the older pocket version of How to Write.

Hi Kevin Hehir,

I'm not sure what you didn't understand about what I wrote about Canada.  I
have heard that in Canada it is easier to get grants, etc., to get money from
the government for arts-oriented activities.  Even going to graduate school
there is often paid for by the government at a quite good rate.  There was a
guy at my grad school from Canada whose name I forget who had a free ride, and
then money on top of it, to study poetry.  I don't know of any deals like this
in America, although they may exist.  You're from canada so perhaps you could
correct this impression.  Where are you from in Canada, and how nice is it?

What I was saying is that someone a while back on the thread said well what
about Canada when we were talking about places to live that weren't too hard
on the head or pocket and yet still had something going for them culturally.
And somebody said Edmonton.  I'm not sure what the cultural breakdown of this
list consists of -- I've only been on it a little more than a month -- but I
am assuming it is mostly Americans.  Somebody correct me if they know.

Americans can't live in Canada -- there is an immigration law -- which again I
don't know well -- we have to show our passports when we cross into Canada and
we aren't permitted to work there.  They can't live or work here, either.  I
think we can visit either way about three months.  Of course there's lots of
places to slip across the border, it's a huge border and I don't think there
is a fence, but you have to have a passport unless you plan to do something
crummy like wash dishes in a flea-bag hotel.  Might as well stay here and do
that, I figure.

So for Americans it is very difficult to get out of America unless you already
have a lot of money.  Burroughs lived in Tangiers, but he had a steady income,
for instance -- 250 a month I once heard -- which in the fifties went a long
way in Tangiers. It was some kind of fund that had been set up for him by what
was left of the Burroughs Adding Machine money.

Many of the Beats tried Mexico, but it was very depressing.  You get a good
exchange rate, but you have to deal with a broken population.  I was one night
in Tijuana -- and couldn't believe it.  Young men were actually selling their
sisters, or so they claimed.  The Beats did also try India.  The despair
sounds nightmarish -- there are 900 million people there and of those nearly
600,000,000 don't have access to a toilet to do their business in, much less
running water. Perhaps Belize or Costa Rica would be all right, but as soon as
you get a functioning economy and working plumbing, the rates go up.

Orlovsky has some poems about the toilet situation in India in his Clean
Asshole Poems.  He tried to clean up a very sick woman, and get the shit off
the street she was living in.  He cleaned off her legs with rubbing alcohol,
and this apparently killed her as the parasites dove deeper into her legs or
something (I can't remember, and his etiology was only speculation as she was
not seen by a coroner but just dumped on a pile of bodies and burned), the
parasites' movement started breaking blood vessels, and she was dead for his
help.  It takes a Mother Theresa to deal with that level of human horror.

I lived in Paris for a year in a garret -- I had a pal who made violin bows
for a living and had won a lot of prizes -- but it was in a crazy
neighborhood.  I had a room that was about ten by ten for three hundred a
month in the late eighties.  Next door lived thirteen Tunisian people in the
same size of room, and two of the kids were teething.  It drove me out of my
mind the tintinnabulation of the bells.

So people have to find a place that suits them.  I remember I asked Burroughs
once at Naropa whether or not I ought to try and go and live in Paris.  Hell
no, he said, it's too expensive.  You spend all your time trying to make the
rent.  Go where nobody else is going.

He chose Lawrence, I assume, on his own advice.

There's lots of medium-sized cities like that around, and maybe some of them
function well enough.  But you also gotta find a clump of other writers, it
seems.  He did that early on in NYC, Burroughs did.  Maybe the idea is to live
in a bigger place early on and then retire out to the farm when you got older.

Vernon, I liked it.  Maybe you could be Minimus.

I liked recently rereading the Max poems how in the ones to himself, or on the
one to himself on p. 45 or so, he suddenly talks about what a failure he is.
Couldn't go to sea like the Portugee or Oddyseus, or his Gloucester heroes.
Couldn't even live except piled up with books and making theories, and now the
sea stretching out from his feet.  It's quite redeeming passage after all the
boasting in the early part.

What is a successful life, anyway?  He apparently felt increasingly like a
failure.  Does everybody at the end?  I once went for a walk in the Finnish
woods in the winter with a Lutheran pastor who told me that he sang songs with
the elderly who were now quite demented in the old folks home but some of them
would refuse to sing, because they had nothing to celebrate having lived the
wrong life, a life that meant nothing to them, or not enough.  They wouldn't
sing, and they'd die a lot earlier than the ones who wanted to sing.

What's there to sing about, anyways?  I guess that's the question he was asking
in his poem.  He found plenty but did seem to gutter out, like Pound, and go
silent and hollow as he turned to drink.

Kirby and others,

This thread's really neat.  :))

Some brief comments:

(1)Lawrence, still a great place, actually, and "a college town" (GREAT!
IMO), and really rural Kansas, so not so expensive, and has a built-in
poetry culture (Jim McCrary, Ken Irby, Lee Chapman, Judy Roitman, Jonathan
Mayhew, John Moritz).  Personally, I think about moving down there often.
Only thing missing is the ocean, or, more importantly, the Pacific Ocean
that's bordered by the Northern California coast...

(2)"Florida" was really cheap back in the late 70's and the cost of living
is low there still.  Gainesville is a college town that I loved.
Jacksonville was fine and I lived right on the beach for three hundred a
month split three ways (1978).  More expensive now, I'm sure, but still low
relatively.  Same goes for the culture there, I'd suspect...

(3)Re: Corso and being kind of a, ummm, "deadbeat?"  Nah, can't abide by a
lot of that.  On the one hand they (especially Kerouac, for me, I guess) are
"heroes" in many ways, but as role models today, NO.  NUMBER ONE: Living off
of others, especially the old-fashioned artist's cliche of living off of
wives, lovers etc., ummm, sucks.  No can do.

(4)I never paid more than $450 a month rent in Northern California for a one
bedroom (Yes, they were tiny, but my last one in Glen Ellen was nice enough)
or same sharing houses or bigger places.  I'm talking 40 minutes north of
San Francisco.  I believe the trick any place is to choose locales outside
the city centers, "out in the country," as it were.  6 of one and half a
dozen of the other, naturally.  And I have never owned a place of my own
anywhere, nor much of anything else, 'cept the proverbial no resale  value
books, my golf clubs, furniture.  Okay, I'm a dunce materially...  There,
I've admitted it.  :))

Hi All,

I will be using Alice Notley's "Descent of Alette" in
an intro lit course (for juniors, but their very first
lit class) that deals with anxiety/visions about the
future (other texts include Dracula, 1984, The Matrix,
Freejack (great cheesy 80s sci fi starring Emilio
Estevez, Mick Jagger, and Anthony Hopkins!), and I am
trying to find teaching resources, lesson plans,
discussion points, and/or critical writing regarding
this book that I can use with the students. It's
probably the first time they will read something
remotely unconventional and I don't want their heads
to explode. Well I would like their heads to explode,
but as productively as possible.

Any suggestions so welcome--

Kazim

we're now back, Grand Nothing, you Zero, you weirdo cluster aiming Dead at
golddiggers
we welldiggers strike back & spit gold, spittle yr plumage now, and as

the Republic, so trembles the rotted tho still-heavy black wind skittish

this will lock syllables onto yr locks, Grand Nothing, Frau Welt, snakes
lying sluggish upon

line will my blood run
at their hitherto pierced sleeps plugged now with phrase sacked from margins

how the sea built us! - you, Grand Nothing, won't last a day against those
eyeball tickets
I'm the dog who ate the prayer, here mosquitoes disdain blood & feast upon
dog food
hummingbirds about yr well feed upon carrion they often create, bigger than
dirt dinner

their tooth pains at yr question "Shake for my will?" stitch yr honor when
it's too elastic,

Let me add a bit.

You didn't stay in Tijuana, you stayed in the red light district of
Tijuana. A lot of Americans live comfortably on the cheap in TJ, but in
other neighborhoods. And there are a lot of poets, many of whom speak
English.  It's also possible to live south of the city in a house on the
beach for a fraction of north-of-the-border costs.

One of the more expensive Mexican cities that has a lot of expats is
Oaxaca, where a large furnished US style apartment in a good neighborhood
will set you back $300.00.

Mexico grants six month tourist visas and renews them liberally.

Paris. Strict rent control, and again a city of many places and prices. Of
major US and European cities one of the cheapest.  Lots of sublets always
available. One way to find them is to list your needs in Liberation, making
clear  that you're a foreigner. Renters will contact you. There are also
numerous agencies, some on the internet. Great bargains are the
near-suburbs. You can be a few feet over the city line, and a half block to
the metro, and the prices (except in Neuilly) drop significantly.

3 month tourist visas. A lot of people cross the border to wherever
(Brussels is popular) for a renewal stamp--you have to insist at the consulate.

Kenneth Cox:  COLLECTED STUDIES IN THE USE OF ENGLISH (Agenda Editions,
2001) Pb, 269 pp, isbn 0 902400 69 X

"I have learned more from Kenneth Cox's essays than from any other
living critic of twentieth century poetry. He writes with masterly
directness about the masters of indirection, and his summarizing power
rivals that of Samuel Johnson." --Thom Gunn

"I used to read Agenda only to catch Cox's thoughtful, well-written
essays, so it's a pleasure to be able to have a compilation of them
here."  --Tony Frazer in Shearsman.

"A 19th-century naturalist whose flora and fauna are 20th-century poets,
Kenneth Cox is the model for how criticism would be written if there
were
anyone other than Cox who could write it."  --Eliot Weinberger

Kenneth Cox states in his Preface that his collection of essays "has
arisen out of attempts initiated in the final third of the century just
ended to introduce new, difficult or neglected work." This is the first
time Kenneth Cox's essays have been collected. The book gives extended
attention to Basil Bunting, Hugh MacDiarmid, Lorine Niedecker, Ezra
Pound, and Louis Zukofsky. There are also essays on Geoffrey Chaucer,
Joseph Conrad, Robert Creeley, Roy Fisher, George Gissing, R.C.
Hutchinson, Alan Jenkins, James Joyce, Gael Turnbull, Allen Upward,
Wyndham Lewis, and W.B. Yeats.

The book can be ordered by phone or fax (01435 872165), by email
(agendapoetry@lycos.co.uk), or by mail (AGENDA, The Wheelwrights,
Fletching St, Mayfield, East Sussex TN20 6TL). Price: $35 USA, $40

Online Experimental Writing Course - Alan Sondheim at trAce Online


Alan Sondheim's course "Experimental Writing" starts at the trAce Online
Writing School on 7th July 2003. Cost =A3140 (about $230) for a 9-week
course.

More information and online registration at
http:/www.tracewritingschool.com

A roller-coaster ride to the edges of literature and philosophy on the
web. Extend your writing into new and uncharted territories and see how
far the internet can push your personal limits. There is no map for this
course - each time it runs in a different direction dictated by the
dynamic of the group itself.

Student comments: "I recommend Alan's course on Experimental Writing for
anyone wanting to discover the interface between writing and computers,
and who aren't afraid to lean a bit over the edge. Not for the faint of
heart."

"I'd thoroughly recommend this course to anyone and everyone interested in
writing. I found it vastly stimulating and productive. Any writer, from
beginner to the most experienced, would find it an invaluable way of
pushing their limits. Alan is a very skilful and generous tutor. Writers
should be queuing up to get on this one."

There is more info at the Experimental Writing course page at

DAVID DAVID---

I would love to get up and see you sometime (as they say)...
hopefully this summer sometime....

but, my friend, you are mistaken---I'm not settled yet at all...
Still in Oaktown desperately groping for boxes, movers, roommates,
bassplayers, gigs for my new band, managers, etc.
(oh, I'll have to get a copy of my CD to you when I settle more too...)

But after July 1st things will hopefully settle!

take care David....

Palindromic diplomacy, I love it. A bit like "palindromic ethics."

But my favorite palindrome is neither diplomatic nor ethical:

"I maim nine men in Miami."

Scott,

Writing from DC, where it will shortly be "too hot to hoot," I have to
admit with some shame that my favorite palindrome is "Xanax."

But there's always the masterful:

"T. Eliot, top bard, notes putrid tang emanating, is sad. I'd assign it a
name: gnat-dirt upset on drab pot-toilet."

Gwyn

Dreyblatt: Aus den Archiven/From the Archives
(Stadtgalerie Saarbr=FCcken - Keurer). In German and English.

Just published. A critical recognition, amply illustrated, with personal
interview  (including DVD) of the American Arnold Dreyblatt's 30 years
achievement as a hypertext installation artist, digital text archivist, and
acoustic instrument designer and composer.

Nothing to do with  the above, does anyone know where the following comes
from and who wrote it, dated after WWI, which I misremember and barbarize a=
s
something like:

Und jetzt ist kommen der Krieg, der Krieg,
Und jetzt ist kommen der Krieg, der Krieg,

The UC Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive
in conjunction with Kelsey St. Press, presents

AUDACIOUS IMAGINATION: A TRIBUTE TO BARBARA GUEST

Sunday, June 29
3:30-5:30 PM
Reception to Follow
Museum Theater, Berkeley Art Museum
2625 Durant Ave, Berkeley, CA


Poets and visual artists celebrate the work of poet Barbara Guest
on the occasion of the publication of her two latest books:
Forces of Imagination: Writing on Writing, and Durer in the Window.
These two collections of essays on art and poetics illuminate Guest's
use of painting from ancient Japanese Genji scrolls to Picasso, Delacroix
to Frankenthaler--as inspiration and example for her own work. She has
written, "the physical extravagance of paint, of enormous canvases can
cause a nurturing envy in the poet that prods his greatest possession,
the imagination, into an expansion of its borders." Guest's career spans
five decades, from her association with the New York School in the
1950s to the present, and twenty-four books of poetry; in 1999 she was
awarded the Frost Medal for Lifetime Achievement by the Poetry Society
of America.


Poet Ann Lauterbach will introduce the event followed by a number of
presenters, each one reading a favorite Guest poem selected from her
entire oeuvre. Participants include the following poets and artists:


Mary Abbott
Mei-mei Berssenbrugge
June Felter
Robert Gluck
Robert Hass
Brenda Hillman
Andrew Joron
Kevin Killian
Laurie Reid
Camille Roy
Jocelyn Saidenberg
Africa Wayne


Forces of Imagination: Writing on Writing (Kelsey St. Press) is a
collection of Guest's essays on poetics spanning three decades.
John Ashbery has written that these essays "are among the most
inspiring works of their kind." Durer in the Window (Roof Books) is a
compilation of Guest's art reviews and essays from the 1950s to the
present accompanied by full-color reproductions of the relevant artworks.

At the risk of going against my own rule to normally not never to tangle
this list with a poem - but, nevertheless, to honor the great gravity and
pull of the day, its gifts and wonders, and in the delightful spirit of
solar share, an offering:

In these kind houses =AD the ones with the aqua-
transparent blue walls =AD bring your friends,
bow to the Gladiola, the Tiger Lily,
the white-throated Woodpecker,
the iridescent fuchsia-burgundy
Humming-bird, the out-sprung blue winged
Heron on a hop and a hop
Along the green river between
 & around her huge, light brown thighs,
the sun sprinkling nothing but heat
and the ting-ting metal handle
against the slender, aluminum canoe,
the dry brush, dark climbing ivy, entwined
light green willow, the fir, the redwood,
an intemperate sky, the sand swollen beach,
small gray river stone, each forward stroke,
palm to handle, pull or push against, the water
awash: deliverance, an intimacy unto sorrow.

Mark Weiss,

Ok, this is interesting to hear about Mexico.  I wanted to know if the people that
live there are then all single males.  Going back and forth can't be easy.  How do
people support themselves outside of America?  It's hard unless you have a work
permit, or are willing to marry a foreign person, or unless you are independently
wealthy.

I've got three kids, so it's hard to move around like that -- popping over borders
to get passports stamped, etc.  I never went to Belgium when I lived in Paris for a
year, but lived in fear of getting picked up by the cops.  Once at Les Halles they
raided the people who often tried to sleep on the Les Halles metro station --
mostly Africans, I think.  These giant policemen were checking passports and people
were running in every direction.  I was walking calmly away and some young man was
running from a big cop, and turned a corner and smashed into me and we both fell
down.  The cop thanked me and checked his passport, but didn't think to check
mine.  I always wore a bowtie and suitcoat to make myself look as innocuous as
possible, though.

I got tired of even that after a year -- tutoring high school kids for their
English baccalaureate.  All ten of my kids passed, at least.

I'd have never thought of Gainesville Florida as a possible place to live.  I drove
past the university there once.  It never occurred to me that either that or
Lawrence would be liveable places.

I wonder what would be some of the least liveable places?  They seem to shift very
quickly.  I had a friend who tried to live in downtown Detroit for a year and he
said the only thing open at night was the police station, and the only thing you

to go back on heroin within a week.

I can only answer a little of this.

Work is always a problem in foreign countries (best to get a job befoire
leaving with an outfit that's willing to get you working papers--lots of
luck), but popping across borders sometimes isn't. Expats on tourist visas
in Paris take the TGV to Belgium and return same route same day.

Anyone know what plans are afoot in the EU re: tourist visas? If it's all
to be one unit for immigration purposes does that mean that the outsider's
3 month tourist permit now covers the whole continent?

Mark Weiss and others on the places thread:

What are some places that are kind of like pilgrimages for American poets?  I was
just drumming up a list:

Gloucester, obviously, for Olson-ites,
Maybe Brooklyn's Prospect Park to see the Camperdown Elm for Marianne Moore fiends
Paterson, I guess, for WCW fans (though that city I believe has changed
tremendously since he wrote about it)

-- What else?  Obviously you have to see Paris, generally.  Do people look up
Pound's residence in Italy?

There's City Lights, I guess.

St. Marks in NYC.

What other places have been made more or less sacred by poets for poets, especially
in America?

Are there places like that in Canada?

No place stays the same. Gloucester, for instance, is now yuppieland, and
the houses in Fort Square, when Olson lived there a Portuguese slum, now
cost megabucks. The buildings are the same, tho gussied up almost beyond
recognition, but there are no kids playing outside and the fishnets no
longer filter the view towards town.


Poe's grave in Baltimore.

Apollinaire's in Pere Lachaise.

Drancy and Quimper for Max Jacob.

The site of the Bateau Lavoire.

Not to mention Yeats' castle.

And the Aran Islands for Synge.

Dunkeld for Gavin Douglas.

Any bar in the old section of Dumfries for the spirits of Burns.

The remains of the great hall in Carcassonne, for all the troubadors who
sang there.

My guess is that wherever you are is sacred to the memory of some or
another writer, there being no shortage of same.

Stephen,

A poetry list without poetry wouldn't make much sense to me...
thanks so much for posting this vivid, evocative poem--so overflowing with
life, so lovely to celebrate solstice hearing this poem.

And some folks from the U Maine Pound listserv did "Pound's London" tours..

Ginsberg did his last reading in London in Blake's baptismal church (now a
converted new age venue).

In Düsseldorf there is a small wealthy shopping district  and train station
named after Heinrich Heine. He had apparently lived in the area; I could
never  find the (rebuilt) house.

Actually, I just remembered that I have a book, in German, boxed up several
thousand miles away about "literary hotels"(Literarische Hotels?).There was
of course the Beat hotel in Paris, and the Chelsea Hotel (NY) for the
Americans.. Anybody know this book? I distinctly recall a picture of
Ginsberg holding a picture of Rimbaud in his hotel room. He never left home
without it..

One of the biggest annoyances of being in Portland is
being constantly bugged for spare change by dumb punk
kids with pure-bred dogs. The acid/heroin casualties
have been a fact of life on the West Coast since the
60s...many a moon since the Summer O' Love and the ol'
Acid Messiah is still taking his time. Dude.
Anyway...there ARE good things about this place. The
climate is more moderate than my old stomping grounds
back in NE Ohio...you can actually not own a car and
get around just fine without one in the city, thanks
to the great public transit system....POWELL'S CITY OF
BOOKS....no state sales tax (bad if you want to "own"
property...great if you don't)...good and great
restaurants...lots of movie theatres...fine galleries
(esp. Blue Sky)...a large Asian community (which my
wife, who is Chinese, really enjoys). What does it
look like? I tell my mom..."it looks like Cleveland,
but with mountains." Ah, if it only had a steel mill
with tall flame stacks......

I'm wrestling with Modell's _Imagination and the Meaningful Brain (MIT,
2003) and think it quite relevant to recent discussions here so will be
posting bits as I go.

I say 'wrestling with' intentionally rather than 'thinking about' as part of
his argument is that is that metaphor is a way of thinking that can include
the physical and somatic and biological beyond language [p. 33 -"It seems
likely that different domains of the mind operate in accordance with
different rules"]

He draws on Vico rather than Descartes (I remember Vico being included in
comparative literature classes somewhere in the remote past even though it
was never a part of any English curiculum I was exposed to), for example, p.
20, "'Intentionality differs from a "motive," which is the reason and
explanation of the action, and from a "desire," which is the awaeness and
experience stemming from the intent' (Freeman, W. _How brains make up their
minds_, London, 1999).  This meaning is in accord with Vico's understanding
that 'meaning is embodied in our total affective interest in the world.'"

Memory is not static or localized but "consists of a process of continual
recategorization, which must involve continued motor activity and repeated
rehersal (Edelman, G. _The remembered present, NY, 1989)

This book is more than an update on Freudian theory - I see it more as
reconceptualizing F in light of modern work on neuropsychology.  As I go
along I welcome comment as I'm not sure how clear I am or how clear I am
being and this is something I'm wrestling with not that I've wrestled and
conquered.

Daleth (12:56 poem full of doubt most likely for MdB)

The leaf of a door on a vertical axis
and itself the equilateral key

shaped just so sideways and round.

The cursive is similar but more rounded;
a door and opening, two forms: door and breast.

Articulate 'the concept of weaning'.
Unguard the breast to open the door,

gravity and humility to circulate down, flow
into abundance: the collection of maple leaves.

Gimmel (showery midafternoon Sunday poem with Banff fudge for MS)
Written with two,
one or two, etc.

Ripen away from oneself
and then modify the home.

Some say, hole
is where the hump is,

or that camels spit and
if they do tunnel, then

it must be linearly toward
sunset, I mean, the letter Z

from out the mountains, past Castle.


Heh (morning poem with a hangover for jb and fw)

"The relationship between the void and the question is almost apparent."

Kom jug, the eh?
It Spadinas the tears
down. Oh God,
that those arms
raised themselves,
relieved themselves,
and then fell, exhausted,
emptied or full of space
they withheld, a heh m.

Het (poem written at derek's while babysitting Madeleine for all of you)

Therefore shall evil come upon thee;
Thou shalt not know from whence it riseth;
And mischief shall fall upon thee suddenly
Shoah, misfortune, destruction,
Which thou shalt not know.
--- verse 11, chapter 47 of the Book of Isaiah

8 clouds and a trap, enclosed
upon itself, the mind alone:

A line seen through two eyes, an H
behind the present time, 11:12 pm, a
barrier as non-choice, rain
on any day comes down between.

Sonnets grounded then held,
char held there, a chord ---=20
wood from Thompson forest,
brought home to burn,
that the center keeps the margins
as much as the reverse is true in Milton.

Well, trapped by your own choices:
is 16 Mile Creek the banks or the water? Aa
new pipeline, A, B and you have to move after
you dwell through C. Whether a crabapple tree

grows in a field or a field grows around
the crabapple tree, the trick lies
in perspective; threshed between
the limits, crushed by the means,
a rocky escarpment divides farms,

as the ends shift you constantly redefine
the letters that eventually appear to confine.

2.

Aleph flux from Beth
through Gimmel could
offer movement through an H,
a self, into some future.

Weather above letters:
rain is not successful, nor
is it yet commodifiable,
although it does fall, and
appear here, bound
to the same center
we're perpetually falling
toward. And in this sense,
Earth does, in fact, sustain (we
are all supposed to know this).


Vav (Mountain and valley poem written thru the foothills of the rockies =
on=20
the way to Salmon Arm for JH and PK)

1.

The shape of the word
is mountain and valleys ---
the V up then A and into V down.

One speaker cuts out then
in over bumps ---
how it could sound.

An oar makes the drive possible.
A ship or boat-like link
between banks and or lines.

From a different perspective
the rainy Friday the 13th drive
from Calgary to Salmon Arm
could be burdensome;
it could be our load to bear.

That the peaks, points, hang,
are hooked above the line
and the word is the Avalanche area
tensed along the Trans-Canada.

Rain in the Sun roof,
descent of the divine energy, a
meeting point as our skin absorbs
water. Can't write in a tunnel.

Slats and columns, supports,
I stands movie frame speed.
Strobe slow down --- the back
then the forth through channel,
structure against nature, tsinor,
esophagus, trachea, artery or spine.

2.

Benveniste attaches
the attributes of the visible,
voice, view, illumination,truth, shine, to this
coordination, junction, meeting-
point, phallus,
channel, pipe, column,
finger, although the shape
and etymology do not
appear to bear these
trees which may have been
mistaken for a fortress.

3.

Vav performs
to indicate male
genetalia --- the
phallic symbol
used for grammar.

Clouds over the mountains,
not just over, obscure
the mountains=20

as the song ends.

Through the valleys, clouds lower
into, of fir, wind across the void water
still drips through onto us and our seats.

At the End of the Avalanche
area sunlight conjoins, passes,

settles along our arms, your
upturned face, bright
warmth after so much rain, smile,

we're almost there.


Yod (poem with a sore wisdom tooth for NY at roughly 8:49 pm on a =
Saturday)

"Come a little bit closer, hear what I have to say..."

When I write the word ice
the word water is also given
and what is taken is time.


Zayin (April 1st Poem for sundown)

1.

* Weapon, knife,=20
two-edged sword;=20
erase: our words
can no longer sit
tongue tied; an
ariel view; flute;
foreword, laws,=20
these instruments:
a scale; white hair;

*arrows, a dart,=20
javelin: that=20
which penetrates,=20
molten larvae from
Australia
splits; not pennies,=20
feather: that=20
which remarks: thirst:=20
warrior armed with a spear.

* All things leading to=20
a goal, or at least 'there';
an aim; to (to be in complete)=20
a finish; instrument, to make=20
sharp, carve out; to mail.

* Per suit: thus, the gal=20
(of the) low, perfection,=20
redenigration, healing.

*uncomfort in grammar
illustrated in plants:=20
wheat, cedar, aloe;=20

Shophetim/Judges; tribe: Gad.

* foundational to the alefbet triad=20
that progresses to nun and culminates in shin

* 7th day, shabbat/a rest,=20
compilation of intent.

2.
red twilight=20
and a red dawn:
the intent
inherent in
letters;
that this is.
From shoulder
to shelter, a place
to be gotten in two,
each space fractures
the line, the letter
and ink finishes
neither, ever at rest,
always exists in growth.

A friend of mine, Lee Gurga, is co-teaching a class on
contemporary poetry and will be using a list of
schools of poetry I made a while back (and which was
discussed a bit here).  He needs a few names of poets
for each school, and I'm not too knowledgeable about
sound poetry.  Hence, I'd appreciate it if anyone
could list a few of the best-known people doing sound
poetry (in English).  I have Steve McCaffery, Jackson
Mac Low and Mike Basinski.  References would be nice,
too, and names of individual poems, or tapes of poems,
etc.

Ditto Performance Poets (as most sound poets also
are).

I see I could use data about environmentalist poets,
too--I have Gary Snyder, Karl Kempton and no one else.
 Wendell Berry?

you might want to think about the Four Horseman (which Steve McCaffery was a
part of in Canada in the 60's -- and also included bp Nichol, Paul Dutton and
Rafael Barreto-Rivera) --
who, um "In a chanting, laughing, screaming dance of the human voice EXPLODE
the word and the non-word"

and most notably missing for this list is Can. sound poet extraordinaire,

Don't forget Christian Bök ("motorized razorblades"), and granddaddies Kurt
Schwitters ("ursonate") and Marinetti ("Siege of Adrianople", otherwise
known as ZANG TUMB TUUMB)..

In fact, for a great list and possibly audio resource check out Kenneth
Goldsmith's "Kenny G" WFMU show from last Thanksgiving and the week after:
http://wfmu.org/playlists/shows/5824
http://wfmu.org/playlists/shows/5966

(Is this show like a secret or shameful or something? It's great and so
little talked about.. Goldsmith did a really wild pastiche/texturing during
the Siege of Iraq: http://wfmu.org/playlists/shows/7003)

And of course the ubu.com website.

Penn Kemp is a terrific Canadian sound poet of the female persuasion

One could make a case that the performance oriented poetics of Adeena
Karasick & Lee Ann Brown qualify as well,

Yes, J, beware of the wrath of Alex should you ever write anything that is

when tipped, a shop table with drawers and a small table made of wicker.
All free to whomever on the list wants any one or several of them --call
510-251-8004 before I alert the flea marketeers. I am just east of
Oakland's Chinatown.

Tom Bell,

How does Modell argue that we decide that something is emotionally meaningful.
Is this some kind of direct process, or is there a filter of judgment first?

I think I agree that we file emotionally meaningful moments in deep, but how
come, and what's the process?

Is this what he is saying?

Geometry goes in one place, and playing with a dog in childhood another?

Why do we do this?  What purpose does it serve from an evolutionary perspective?

Arielle and Mark --

I like Portland Oregon too.  I lived in Beaverton for a year while
teaching out there.  While Portland is great -- the highest building by
law is I think 9 floors or something, and Powell's Books is wonderful,
and the street scene (without all the bummy kids with dogs around the
light rail stops) is good, Beaverton was something else entirely again.
Beaverton is where all the excess of Portland people have moved.  It's
technically only about ten miles or less outside of Portland.  And in
fact Portland itself legally goes past Beaverton, in one long corridor
of its urban growth boundary so that elk continue to go through the city
itself in large herds.  But all that is being squeezed out by endless
condos dotted with occasional mall plazas.  20 years ago there were 6000
people in the Beaverton area.  Now there are 130,000 and it's growing.
As a result, nothing works.  The streets go from three lanes to two to
one and back again in a one or two-block stretch, so there is a constant
telescoping in and out of traffic.  There aren't any sidewalks either.
You can have a sidewalk in front of a new condo and then a grandfathered
house that's been there a hundred years refuses to have a sidewalk so
you walk in the ditch in front of it and try to avoid getting hit by a
bus.  You basically can't walk in Beaverton or you'll get killed.  Some
parts of the road are only fifteen feet wide, and two busses will pass
on that stretch and you basically have to jump down in a ditch.

Also, all the pavement in Beaverton killed all the little parks they
tried to set up.  The little parks flood, and so all the trees have died
in them.  It's like Edgar Allan Poe -- dead trees.  They're going to
have to bulldoze the parks and replant, a ranger told me once.  There
are weird animals that look like beavers but have orange teeth living in
creepy swamp type areas.  They eat all the trees that are left.  It's a
mess.  Then when you get out to Hillsboro it's ok again -- an older
town, with lots of nice little 50s houses, and a good old-style Dairy
Queen.  that area is very Hispanic now.  They even have a Hispanic
grocery.  Beaverton on the other hand is yuppy computer programmers --
who work in faceless buildings on swampy land.

Beaverton doesn't have any beavers any longer.  It's some kind of weird
rat with orange teeth that came out of the bayou that lives there now
and has forced out the beaver.

Subject:      Pilgrimage: Camden and Canyonlands
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Two places I think are worthy of pilgrimages for poets in America, because
these places are holy, though in very different ways: Camden NJ and
Canyonlands National Park, Utah.  Both are holy in that they are places
where you may witness directly the action of time itself.  Witnessing time
is a very important thing for any poet.

Camden NJ is the city in which I was born, of course, oh, yeah that, and the
place Walt Whitman died (328 Mickle Blvd), just four blocks away from where
I was born.  OK I'll cease with my cheekiness.  I think the place worthy of
pilgrimage because the relationship between present-day Camden and Whitman
echo America's relationship with poetry: ghettoization.  An odd and painful
relationship indeed, one struggling to improve itself.  Camden at least in
1990 was the poorest per capita city in the US.  With the number of
dilapidated crack houses in Camden you'd think you were in the Bronx in
1978.  Me and my bratty middle-class friends in high school used to drive to
Camden to get indigent people to buy liquor for us and as we advanced in our
abilities to fuck ourselves up, began driving up to street drug purchases.
I remember one evening me and my pal were about to be carjacked, and my
friend Joe who was driving actually drove up the sidewalk in order to avoid
the armed man in front of us.  And yeah they fired a couple of rounds into
the back of his car.  Explain that to white middle class mom.  I think every
poet should see Camden as it is now and maybe try to imagine how remote
"Leaves of Grass" is from the city that in many ways now looks like Hell.
Fortunately people like the very gifted poet Alicia Askenase have done what
they could to bring poetry back to Camden by way of running the Walt Whitman
Arts Center which has operated inside a gorgeous Carnegie library.  I have
just read that the state of NJ is slashing all arts funding to 0.  They're
probably blaming it on a poet (Baraka) and the removal of funding is
certainly going to take away from Camden that which such funding has brought
back to Camden.  So undoubtedly without private funding the Whitman Center
will close, and I imagine Alicia will be out of a job?  Eesh.  Camden NJ is
an expression of what we have lost and what we are trying desperately to
regain.

Another place I recommend for pilgrimage is Canyonlands National Park.
First of all, it is perhaps the most beautiful place in America.  Eon upon
eon of erosion expresses itself in many-colored cliff faces and wildly
undulating canyon rims.  Red, green, white, black, orange, yellow all held
against an endless blue sky.  It is as if fractals have come alive,
particularly the formation known as Monument Basin when seen from the
Islands in the Sky (appropriately named) lookout point.  And yet looking out
over Canyonlands you cannot believe how large the earth is and how large the
stones are that this earth moves and how long all of it takes, and how
beautiful it all is.  Sometimes I think being at Canyonlands is the closest
thing to being on Mars.  It's not a flowery or cheery place exactly: it
appears as if the earth aches in Canyonlands.  But it is truly
awe-inspiring.  That dissonance inherent within the most striking forms of
beauty is what Canyonlands possesses, is what draws me to that place over
and over again.  Oh and it helps that of all of the gorgeous national parks
in Utah, Canyonlands is the least visited.  You'll likely find yourself
alone even on the most popular of lookout trails.  You can go there as a
car-bound casual visitor, or you can go as a hiker.  Either way is amazing.
If you like water, you can visit Canyonlands from the South by way of Lake
Powell.  Lake Powell's radically undulating coastline, I have been told, is
longer than the entire eastern Pacific coast.  (I'd like to see how exactly
someone figured that out.)   Canyonlands is an expression of what we still
have and what we are trying desperately to hold on to.

So I think if you're going to make pilgrimages for poetry in America, one
should undoubtedly be for Walt Whitman, and the other should be for   what
is left of the striking beauty of the land of America.  Camden NJ and
Canyonlands National Park.  What we in America have lost and what we still
have.

Yours,
Patrick

Mark Weiss and others on the places thread:

What are some places that are kind of like pilgrimages for American poets?
I was
just drumming up a list:

Gloucester, obviously, for Olson-ites,
Maybe Brooklyn's Prospect Park to see the Camperdown Elm for Marianne Moore
fiends
Paterson, I guess, for WCW fans (though that city I believe has changed
tremendously since he wrote about it)

-- What else?  Obviously you have to see Paris, generally.  Do people look
up
Pound's residence in Italy?

There's City Lights, I guess.

St. Marks in NYC.

What other places have been made more or less sacred by poets for poets,
especially
in America?

Are there places like that in Canada?

Jaap Blonk -- many recordings available, mostly on small European new
music labels.

And though he positions himself more within music than poetry, it
wouldn't be much of a stretch to hear Phil Minton as a sound poet.
Check out, esp., his quartet's take on themes and language from
Finnegan's Wake (title slips my mind at the moment) on the Candian
Victo label. Maggie Nichols (sp?) is another interesting one who might
fall into this same interzone between music and poetry.

Subject:      Where to live: Why not take Albany? and alicia a.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hi all,

I lived in Albany for two years, and, prior to that, visited my ex up there for three years. It's the city where I started my press; the city where I first started writing work on a regular basis that I thought was any good; the city where I was first embraced by a community of poets, comprised of the SUNY students--undergrad and grad, the locals, and the state-worker poets.

It gets a little cold, but it's a beautiful city, one whose architecture reminds my Boston friends of home; damn affordable--I lived in a 1/4 of a brownstone there with two other boog editors, and we had 3 bedrooms, living room, dining room, eat-in kitchen, bathroom with clawfoot tub, back porch, and back yard, and we paid $200 each (this was 1992-1993); some great bookstores and record shops; some wonderful parks, including Washington Park, designed by Central Park's Frederick Law Olmstead; a bunch of venues and readings; its within three hours of philly, nyc, and boston; an hour from good skiing; swell museums; and a great indie movie theatre.

I also met so many amazing poets up there, almost too many to name, but here's a few, some of whom y'all will recognize--David Baratier,  Chris Funkhouser, Chris Stroffolino, Rachel Aydt, Tom Nattell, Dan Wilcox, Charlie Rossiter, Don Byrd, Pierre Joris, and, most importantly, Katie Yates, who had been Anne Waldman's ass't. at Naropa, where she graduated with her MFA, and convinced me to attend it for the first time, something to which I'm forever in her debt.

Being a town whose population is greatly made up of state workers and students defines the city. The turnover of the students from the numerous colleges in the capital district area (RPI, Union, St. Rose, SUNY-Albany, etc.) helps keep the area fresh, injecting life into the poetry scene.

Now, all that being said, I've always said that Albany was a great place until you're 25 and a great place for after you're 55. However great it is, it's still very much a town and not a city, one of those places you need to escape from at a certain age to experience more of life, before you return to it an older age.

as ever,
david

p.s. alicia askenase was, regrettably let go from the whitman association in camden due to budget cuts. damn shame, because she made that place happen in so many ways.

Wow, thanks for all the quick & valuable responses to
my request--even though most of them made me feel kind
of stupit.  How I couldn't have thought of Cobbing and
Claire, who knows.  And I've even met and heard
Christian Bok.

Know bissett as a poet on the page but didn't know he
did sound poetry.

Adeema Karasick and Lee Ann Brown are good choices
that I'll use for performance poetry names because I
seem now to have more than enough good names for sound
poetry.  (Vexed area, the difference between sound and
performance, that I haven't worked out but maybe
eventually will.  Are there any non-performing sound
poets?)

There's "The Loch Ness Monster's Song" by Edwin Morgan.  Eddie does do it at
readings, but it's not really a performance poem.  Similarly "First Men on
Mercury".

But this would call-up the whole problem of an overlap between concrete
poetry, sound poetry, and line poetry ...

Geez, what a long migration for a small beast. Would be interesting to know
the vector.

Kirby should know that nutria are edible. Of course, so are beaver (had a
lovely plate of same in Paris, of all places, and I mean no sexual innuendo).

Not that he never "performed" as such, but arguably Henri Chopin's most
significant sound poetry exists primarily as an artifact of various
close-miking and multitracking recordings procedures.

Please pass along to friends, sign them up if you think they might be open
to supporting some resistance to the Bush regime, and help this impeachment
movement grow.  If a President can be impeached for something as trivial as
lying about getting a sloppy blow job then a President must surely be
impeachable for committing high crimes against Americans and the global
community.

Incidentally, George Bush's lying about WMDs is a felony according to his
Patriot act and can be added to Bush's long list of impeachable offenses.
Yeah, let's see if Asscroft goes after that one any time soon.

How We Will Reach One Million Votes
The Each One, Reach One Campaign

Dear VoteToImpeach Member,

Last month Ramsey Clark appealed to the 250,000 VoteToImpeach members to
help build the campaign. Now, we are launching a new initiative to take this
campaign to the million vote mark.

The framework of the initiative could not be more simple. It is captured in
its name: Each One, Reach One. We are asking all VoteToImpeach members to
commit to getting just one additional person to vote to impeach online. We
know that many members will do more. But if each of us got one person to
vote this month we would pass the half a million mark, and if we do the same
in the following months, we will have reached the million mark.

These million votes will be taken to the House Judiciary Committee.
Twenty-nine years ago next month, the House Judiciary Committee, with sharp
division, voted for Articles of Impeachment for Richard M. Nixon. Within a
month, on August 9, 1974 Richard Nixon resigned rather than face
impeachment. Let us not forget that Nixon's near-impeachment and resignation
came a year and a half after he won one of the biggest landslide elections
in U.S. history.

Among the Articles of Impeachment, Nixon was charged with "making or causing
to be made false or misleading statements for the purpose of deceiving the
people of the United States...." The relevance of the Nixon impeachment
proceedings with the case against George W. Bush et al., was noted recently
by John Dean, the former counsel to President Nixon in a June 11, 2003
article titled "The Case for Impeachment."

Responding to the growing public outcry regarding Bush's lies and deceptions
that were used as the rationale for the invasion of Iraq, Dean wrote, "To
put it bluntly, if Bush has taken Congress and the nation into war based on
bogus information, he is cooked. Manipulation or deliberate misuse of
national security intelligence data, if proven, could be a 'high crime'
under the Constitution's impeachment clause. It would be also be a violation
of federal criminal law, including the broad federal anti-conspiracy
statute, which renders it a felony 'to defraud the United States, or any
agency thereof in any manner for any purpose.'

      " It's important to recall that when Richard Nixon resigned, he was
about to be impeached by the House of Representatives for misusing the CIA
and FBI. After Watergate, all presidents are on notice that manipulating or
misusing any agency of the executive branch improperly is a serious abuse of
presidential power."

      Dean asserts, "in the three decades since Watergate, this is the first
potential scandal I have seen that could make Watergate pale by comparison.
If the Bush administration intentionally manipulated or misrepresented
intelligence to get Congress to authorize, and the public to support,
military action to take control of Iraq, then that would be a monstrous
misdeed."

When George W. Bush addressed the nation on March 17, 2003, to announce that
war against Iraq had become inevitable and imminent, he stated,
"Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that
the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal
weapons ever devised."

Bush administration officials systematically lied to the people of the
United States, to Congress and to the United Nations. Tens of thousands of
Iraqis have now been killed and maimed. Iraq society has been plunged into
chaos and misery. Its sovereignty shredded by an illegal occupation.
Hundreds of US GI's have been killed and wounded. While waging an illegal
war against the people of Iraq, the administration has carried out a war
home -- an attack on the civil rights and liberties of the people of the
United States and on the Bill of Rights itself.

     The VoteToImpeach campaign is a critical effort. As Ramsey Clark stated
in his May 12 address at the National Press Club that was broadcast
nationally on C-Span: "When people vote to Impeach it is important. It
reminds Americans that the Constitution provides the means for removing an
Imperial President and officials who commit high crimes."

The administration's crimes, including its lies and deceptions, are becoming
increasingly exposed in the public discourse and media. Pressure is growing
for Congressional hearings on the Administration's lies and deliberate
manipulation of "intelligence data" related to the much ballyhooed
connection between Iraq and Al' Qaeda and the patently false claim about the
"grave and imminent threat" posed by Iraq's alleged Weapons of Mass
Destruction. Under these circumstances it is all the more important to
expand the grassroots VotetoImpeach campaign.

Not Woodchucks, but Mall Rats!
Kirby's description of Beaverton is great! If one
takes the Max train out there, you will pass through a
long, dark tunnel, only to be greeted with a town
right out of Pete Seeger's "Little Boxes".

Sparrow

Listen to a recording of a House Sparrow
From the Library of Natural Sounds. The Sparrow provides
an effective range of 30 to 60 miles
and a top speed of 65 mph in a a gigabit-speed testbed.

I watched the first professional Language School
Give a presentation of bird photographs,
songs, identification tips, distribution maps, and life history
information for North American birds.

If we eat like a bird - immense amounts of food - and lose weight
so close to getting the new AC
Sparrow is a radar-guided air-to-air missile

This Wisconsin-based nursery sells peonies, daylillies, irises.
and a white-breasted nuthatch nests in my
urethra, and begins to sing.

*

Sparrow

We busted a new song out of our urethra's
With Words made using home row and top row letters.
Reproductive organs, male, feline, lateral.
like spit or tears or menstrual fluids from my anus.

The sparrow thought it was the end
Due to American kestrels, or "sparrow
hawks", to help control starling, blackbird and sparrow numbers

The crystal would be used
to cut into the underside of the penis

Connected to the kidneys by two ureters
He is represented riding on a sparrow, and he holds in his hand a bow.

A “Kitten Opening”
in her abdominal wall

A white-breasted nuthatch nests in my
urethra, and begins to sing.

*

Sparrow

After a crowd of a dozen people gather
and several of them try to open the door,
we nest in a deciduous tree, occasionally vine tangles
around landing gear,
pushrod tubes in place,
easy battery access through the top hatch.

So that's how the Mechanics come and go

Twelve days after my chicks hatch, they are able to fly by themselves.
Their parents take them around and show them where to get food
For they need to be fed with insects,
which form a very important
Variation in Song.

The eggs will hatch in twelve days
In a combination of coloured plastic rings
A Sparrow nest defense
Where the battery compartment is located
and sized for correct balance

On the other hand the essence of a pawnshop is bargaining.

A white-breasted nuthatch nests in my
urethra, and begins to sing.

*

Sparrow

I stop for groceries on the way home
and buy out the store (does that count
as nesting? ... Then I have a push
in which I feel a burning pain at my urethra.

If you notice a bird making its way
down a tree headfirst
overcapitalizing wildwoods
the corner of the cabinets; he hits the lazy susan door
headfirst battleground urethra plushy customhouse
Good Air In, Bad Air Out.

First, grab your penis by the base, squeeze up and wipe
this swab on your urethra to take a culture
Thousands of nesting sea birds, literally covering every inch
The stuff passes through my lips to my urethra unchanged!

Your remodeled urethra will have a shorter path,
so once you wipe It may take a year or two
to attract a nesting pair of kestrels
The following figure shows the nesting preferences
of closely related warbler species.
A white-breasted nuthatch nests in my
urethra, and begins to sing.

Sparrow

These must be the zen geniuses of the sparrow species
who vibrate and explode onto the next
pummel of a rapier.

Sesame seed mixed with the contents of sparrow eggs
dedicating one part of a solo that morphs into
avatar, flying above
the housetops.

He could see a sparrow hawk circling the inlet
looming three hundred feet above it
like gleaming modern
sparrow reproduction, food availability, and predation.
Another sparrow hawk hovered over pyramids of redwood logs
about missile motor burnout which accelerated the 435-pound Sparrow

Maybe the main Witnessing given to us
Is when a white-breasted nuthatch nests in my
urethra, and begins to sing.

*

Sparrow

The swallow, sparrow, crow, owl, eagle
and hen all wanted to learn
To sing in more than one dialect.

Does their song change according to the stage of the nesting cycle?
In The Scheme Language, Sparrow songs are learned
Using Core Readings of the White-Crowned Sparrow
so every day in the tree he said
I am not afraid of heaven and I am not afraid of earth except for the sun
Comparison with Birdsong (again).

This simple tree structure we can define a parrot as a bird and a mammal,
but not a sparrow.
Children see the cynicism of this language.
That these snags create good nesting cavities
when a white-breasted nuthatch nests in my
urethra, and begins to sing.

Two pieces


History


The deposits contain not only prehistoric artifacts but also extraordinary
records of fossil flora and fauna, making Hoxne one of the few paleolithic
sites where life on Balkan Peninsula and proofs for human presence from
paleolithic epoch were of terrain. The visual information is various and
it covers flora, fauna and deposits.

I began using augmented chords. I began using diminished chords. I jumped
equally among the keys. I located tonalities with grave respects. I
hammered out major seconds. I worked with astonished rhythms:

The great bombs fall incipient.

The furious pleasure of the violent president of war.

Daddy daddy won a country!

We fought the good fight, now we're out of sight.

...

I called the slogans and played around them. I described the slogans and
the music playing. I played the music and called around it:

Furious motivations.

White culture death.

Obscenity.

Fury.

...

I forgot the music and entered space. I was in the zone. I went back to
Hoxne. I was in Hoxne. I left traces. I was furious for an optimistic
future.

APG (Atlanta Poetry Group) has been doing quite a bit of sound poetry
and recently released a CD of their work.

razor smile number 2 almost ready to go.  this week i have been mostly
absorbing production chemicals.  i did some of the lay up, had to redraw the
acoustic sigil annotation - not easy when you don't read music - and matt
laid up the final copy.

wednesday i went down the unemployed resource centre, a grammatically crap
name for a good organisation.  i printed off on a duplo, not as bad as it
sounds cos it's only a week old.  the issue is 52 pages long (resonating
with a deck of cards), each page A5, so that's 13 (nice magickal reference)
double sided A4 sheets, which for 200 copies is five reams of paper and then
some.  as i waited for the ink to dry in between runs i wondered why we
weren't publishing straight to the web.  i felt so sick after i had to go
sit in the park for an hour.

back the next day to use the folding machine and then hand collate the 200
copies of 13 sheets, before sticking them through the mad bastard finger
fuck stapler.  but they look good, there's something so tactile about a
paper zine, the way it flicks through my fingers, and the wonderful smell of
printing ink, the words fill my hands and nostrils simultaneously.

today i got paid for a film job, not much but it'll meet the cost of the cd
dupe, so we don't have to fight with a domestic burner.  for five years
we've been saying to alan how much we'd like to get some of his stuff on cd
and bang it out over here, and at long bloody last it that's going to
happen.  the cd will be attached to the back of the zine and is not
replicated between the covers.

this afternoon, while the kids watched the lost boys and matt dozed in the
garden, i cut up the screen prints for the front cover, metal ruler and
scalpel like.  ooooooooo i enjoyed that, the blade slicing along the edge of
the steel and scaring the board, each lino print bordered and perfect in its
own little world of paperyness.  and i knew then why razor smile isn't
published on the net, it's cos it's handmade, and not much is these days,
although you can sometimes see the intellect behind the machine it's harder
to feel the touch.  my hand has been in all of these, each page has been
through my fingers, i have stroked each copy.

spray mount, now there's another vile chemical, but really the only way to
attach the prints to the cover.  swallowing a substantial amount of fumes
guaranteed another bout of fresh air gulping outside.  sitting on the sofa
in the garden, green leather overgrown with ivy, i wondered what other
people would make of these efforts and came to the conclusion that i didn't
give a shit.  to be productive is everything, doing nothing is not an
option, and on this longest day, for a job that seems to have taken ages,
you know i'm happy that every page of every issue has passed through my
hands and into my consciousness.  somehow it reminds me of handling a cock,
matt's cos i really don't remember anyone else's after 13 years.  bare with
me, it's kind of the similar, like although the finger positions are
different, the notes are sort of the same, i mean you're still playing the
guitar whether in you're F or C.  and then there's the smell, printing ink
and whatever that cock smell is called, there's something seductive about
those smells, smell, mmm, smell, good for a while but can be sickening after
four hours of close exposure.  and swallowing those chemicals, the mist of
spray mount, like come (or cum for you amerikans) one mouthful is enough,
you don't want it eight times in an hour with no option to spit.

anyway, i digress, if anyone wants a copy, of the zine, send us something,
even if it's only a button, with an sae and you can have one.

After about 9 months of being a member of the Poetics forum, I've decided to
take an extended leave. I've met some absolutely amazing people here and
enjoyed the contacts immensely, and am going to miss the fine literary
writing I've read as well as the provocative discussions, but I need to move
on for personal reasons. Any of you who still wish to receive messages from
me concerning my latest projects may email me and I will put you on the
list. Otherwise, I will be out of your life for good. Should you prefer not
to keep so closely in touch, it's no big deal; if we have interests in
common we probably will meet again in some form or another somewhere down
the line.

Bye!

"Selected Bibliography of New Poetries" by Larry Wendt is in The Poetry
Reading: A Contemporary Compendium on Language & Performance, edited by
Stephen Vincent & Ellen Zweig (Momo's Press, 1981) At that point in time,
this selection was probably the most exhaustive reference on sound poetry
(recordings, books, articles, etc.) available.

I still have some copies of this book - 347 pages - which some consider an
invaluable period reference.  ($20, postage included - b/c moi).

more:

He defines metaphor as "the transfer of meaning between dissimilar
domains,,,,in the case of traumatic memories, a metaphoric process transfers
meanings between the dissimilar domains of past and present time."  He goes
on to descrobe the transfer between different sensory modalities which is
what poetry does?

He is also taking about the psychology of things which is not always
translatable into neurophysiology or even neuropsychology.

Thanks.

One of the classes I'm teaching in the fall quarter is Modern British
Literature, and I've been looking for a book of critical essays that
either traces the evolution from modernism to postmodernism in British
lit. or that looks at key 20th century British writers from both
modernist and postmodernist perspectives. I'm thinking of simply using
Michael Levenson's _Cambridge Companion to Modernism_ and then selecting
specific literary texts in editions that contain contemporary
evaluations of their work. But, I wondered if you know of a good
critical text that makes a general modern/postmodern theoretical
comparison. (I always had this problem in Writing in the Visual Arts,
too, in that I wanted a general text that helped the student develop and
distinguish between theoretical lenses without getting them bogged down
in the complexity and weight of the original theoretical texts.)  Any
suggestions?

I declare my earnings as a writer, but my losses almost always exceed them.
My accountant knows how to minimize the damage, but the shadow of my not
turning a profit 3 years out of 5 or whatever is always there for the IRS,
who most likely would look at me as a conventional business and wonder why I
didn't stop writing poetry the way, say, an
auto manufacturer might. I think there's a provision that without me the
"business" couldn't continue, which offers me some protection. But it
usually doesn't save me anything on my taxes.

Hi Bob,

Here are a couple I thought of:

Sound/performance poets: bill bissett (a couple of CDs available), Adeena
Karasick, Edwin Torres (I think he has one or two CDs out, too?), Nada
Gordon

Environmentalist poets (not in the way Gary Snyder might be, but): Pat Reed
(esp. _More Awesome_), Marcella Durand, Lytle Shaw, Juliana Spahr (esp.
"Nature Poetry"), Eileen Myles (Skies)

Gary

Ive always had a big problem with the phrase "environmentalist" poet.
I could see describing someone as an environmentalist & a poet.  But
environmentalism is about direct action. Planting forests & gardens,
bothering stodgy legislators, living a low impact existence, advancing
the cause of organics, hugging trees, creating eco-villages & bringing
consciousness to our rapidly imploding diversity.  Eco-branding poets
or poetry smacks of armchair environmentalism.

Mark,
I know I'm a little behind on this thread, but I'd like to offer another
perspective on Gloucester, MA.

*There are "yuppies" in Gloucester but as far as I can tell they do not live
on the Fort. And there are far fewer young urban professionals & their
*shoppes* in Gloucester than in other nearby places like Newburyport, MA &
Portsmouth, NH.

*Perhaps you found no children on the fort because of the many grandparents
who live there.
Some year (perhaps this one) you should come to Gloucester on the last
Sunday of June when a statue of St. Peter is carried through the Fort while
these grandparents & their grandchildren throw confetti from second story
windows. {The celebration for San Pietro begins this Thursday: the sacred &
the profane are seldom closer!}

*Also, you perhaps did not find the Portuguese "slum" on the Fort because
Sicilian immigrants have been more visible in that particular area since the
early twentieth century. St. Peter's Fiesta, a Sicilian celebration, was
born in the Fort in the 20s. "Portugee" Hill is some distance from the fort.

*Recently, the culture of Gloucester (at least as I see it as a high school
teacher here) has been far more influenced by the arrival of Brazilian
immigrants than by a (non-existant) invasion of yuppies.

*As for fishing, my brother-in-law is a fisherman, though one who like many
others has been forced to supplement his income with other employment. If
you're looking for fishermen in Gloucester try the Jodrey State Fish Pier
(from the Fort go further into the inner harbor). Also, it must be said that
overfishing & the resulting regulations--not yuppies--*have* changed
Gloucester. In fact (much to the dismay of many pro-tourist politicians in
town) the decline of the fishing industry has not meant a yuppie invasion on
the scale many other seaside towns have experienced. As Olson predicted, the
A. Piatt Andrew bridge which extends route 128 into Gloucester irrevocably
changed the city. Gloucester citizens were "isolatos" no more...or at least
less so. But this change was already underfoot when Olson was writing.

*There is an excellent independent bookstore (The Bookstore) not far from
the Fort. (I met Olson's Danish translator there one summer day. I think I
also met the list's own Aaron Vidaver there too.)

*Dogtown, which comprises a significant portion of the interior of the
"island," will never (knock on wood; forgive the hubris) be filled with
cul-de-sac developments. Though you are likely to run into more off-road
cylists, Dogtown is still an excellent place for a walk. (Bring the Maximus
Poems poems with you ye Pilgrims...and perhaps Marsden Hartley's "Dogtown
Doxology" if that's your thing). Ravenswood is also quite wonderful.

*Gerrit Lansing lives in Gloucester!

*My wife (www.ironstonewhirlygig.blogspot.com) might disagree w/ me about
this, but winters are hard in Gloucester--though, again, not because of the
yuppies. Not a lot happens here during the winters. But because of Jim
Behrle, Bill Corbett, etc. there are many exciting events & people in Boston
(a 50 minute drive or hour train ride from Gloucester). Yesterday, a half
dozen Boston-area poets came out to our apartment here in Gloucester for
food, drink, walks, music, & poetry.

If anyone wants to come to Gloucester let me know.

Suggestion 1: use works from the writers themselves to teach the ideas =
rather than essays  by others which explain the movements. 2. from the =
readings, have students write essays attempting to define/explain the =
essential elements found in the Modernist and post modernist =
writers...I'll assume your lectures and the discussion sessions will =
assist students in the task of discovery.  =20

I found the following made for interesting reading:=20

"The Longman Anthology of British Literature,"  Vol. 2...could actually =

I second Chris Stroffolino's recommendtion of Jennifer Moxley's essay
"Ancients and Contemporaries" in Dan Bouchard's Poker 2. _The Descent of
Alette_ (which I am reading {thanks Christina Strong} for the first time
because of Moxley's essay) and James Thomas Stevens' _Combing the Snakes
from His Hair_ are read in terms of how they "engage myth and/or folk
culture and ... conflate the roles of 'public' and 'private'. Moxley argues
that both books "make ancient and traditional cultural votices resonant and
meaningful." Hope the essay proves helpful.

Hi mIEKAL,

I don't think any of the people I mentioned would call themselves
"environmentalist poets"--I was just picking up the phrase from Bob. But I
do think that those I listed have "the environment" in some significant way
as a kind of focus in some, or (in Pat Reed's case) even much, of their
work, which seemed to be what Bob might be looking for ...?

Jack Collom evidently in the past has spoken of the totality of a poem as
'an ecology', or as a complex that is 'eco-driven.'  Anselm Berrigan
mentioned that his having heard Collom speak this way about composition -
including as much of everything that is on-going as one writes - had some
influence on the composition of his Zero Star Hotel, altho Berrigan's
concept of 'an ecology' as a practise was, by his admission, at some
variance with Collom's.

Website announcement:
<http://bourgeoizine.pabn.org/>http://bourgeoizine.pabn.org/

(formerly known as) L'bourgeoizine, a free, non-profit literary arts zine, was
founded in early 2001 by some Illinois State University students. It has since
grown into an international community of some 300 people.

The primary philosophies underlying the zine include the beliefs that all
literatures are rooted in particular places and times, that artists and readers
work together to produce meaningful artworks, that people should create their
own art, and that communities should work to minimize the costs involved in
both the production of art and the making of that art available to those who
want it. The zine has from the start supported copylefting, and every issue may
be freely reproduced and distributed (we ask, however, that you respect
individual artists' wishes, if stated).

Please feel free to link our page to yours, or to submit material for future
issues. The page is under construction, so some of the links are broken and
several pages have empty content. If you'd like a copy of the new issue (#8),
to be released in late July, let me know <jtthoma@ilstu.edu> or send a note to
<bourgeoizine@hotmail.com>.

Keep in mind that the zine is not for profit, and that all expenses are paid
out of pocket by the production staff or through donations. If you'd like to
copy and distribute copies of the zine in your area, let us know and we'll send
you a master copy of the zine (unfolded and unstapled).

An incomplete list of past
<http://bourgeoizine.pabn.org/contributors.html>contributors is on the website.
We're in the process of updating that list. Some of our more well-known
contributors include Arnold Adoff, Gabe Gudding, A.L. Nielson, Nick Piombino,
and Curtis White.

Best to all of you,
Joseph Thomas

I was in Gloucester for the first time in many years this past winter. The
Fort was inhabited by yuppies (I know, it's an archaic term), it's houses
had undergone expensive restoration and its grounds landscaping,  the main
drag looked like that of most North Shore commuter towns, and real estate
prices had skyrocketed. Of course the changes had begun in Olson's
lifetime, but the changes (my reference is 1970, when I began visiting
Linda Parker and Gerrit) are nonetheless unmistakeable. It's still a
wonderful place, worthy of pilgrimage and I'd imagine a pretty good place
to live. It's extravagantly beautiful and a short trip to Boston, and there
is that bookstore.  And yuppification has brought some good places to eat.
It's not Newburyport yet, and hopefully it will retain more of its social
diversity than some of the other North Shore towns, but I wouldn't place
too many bets on that.

Change, and at a pace few would have imagined in the past (but see Henry
Adams in The Education...), is apparently everywhere inevitable, and seems
not to require Olson's "will to change."

    New Titles

Seven Glass Bowls by Daphne Marlatt. ISBN 0-9731521-5-X. $10.00 plus $2.50 p
& p.

        "Home and the closeness of the beloved," she writes. There can be no
    subject as important to the poet and the rest of us, and in this lovely
    poem, Daphne Marlatt continuously achieves her best yet "homing in." That
    present participle is our sweet clue to a mystery we are encouraged to
    enter. Gladly.   (George Bowering)

Fat Chance  by Dodie Bellamy.  ISBN 0-9731521-3-3. $12.00 plus $2.50 p & p.

        In this writing it's like Dodie Bellamy's being questioned by 12
    detectives. They are talking over one another so naturally her voice assumes
    12 simultaneous registers, each very endearing but still hot. After she
    recites her collected works the detectives are willing to forgive
    everything. They only want to sleep with her. (Cedar Sigo)

        Bellamy's Fat Chance is pellucid, masterful prose, at once a bodiceful
    of grainy secrets, a set of falsities, and a treasury of urbane/innocent
    candor. To her, against eternity, I raise a glass of stingo! There are many
    reasons I read Bellamy, not least for the rapidity of insight, mediumistic
    sprit, and her enormous, at times jocular, tenderness. (Lissa Wolsak)

Island of Lost Souls: A Play  by Kevin Killian. ISBN 0-9731521-4-1. $14.00
plus $2.50 p & p.
        SUNNY: I'm fading, but I'm still stunning, like a loud clap of hands in
    a forest - maybe I shouldn't have eaten all that candy.  I feel my blood
    sugar rising, turning my blue blood white, like the blue frost that makes
    snow flake.  It was the chocolate done me in, a victim of Whitman and
    Godiva.  Come, Gabrielle, bring your Canadian freshness into this overheated
    place of fat!



    * * *



    Long Island, 1964: one valiant woman attempts to save her family with only
    brains and faith in God.  Will Gabrielle Kerouac be able to protect the
    befuddled genius of her son, Jack, from Hollywood producers hot to make a
    musical out of his masterpiece, On the Road, a book she herself wrote while
    he was unconscious? Will she find love in the arms of ailing heiress Sunny
    von Bulow, or lose her to the sinister machinations of her depraved husband
    Claus, and his twin sister, the evil, amoral Clarice?  Kevin Killian's
    memory play, written for the Poets' Theater in San Francisco, exposes at
    every turn the tangled contradictions of modern life, the fragility of the
    individual talent, the weird panic that ensues when suddenly you remember
    that many years ago you gave your baby away at the top of a waterfall. . .



    Forthcoming

      Draft, unnumbered: Précis by Rachel Blau Duplessis

    Wanders.   Nineteen poems by Robin Blaser with nineteen responses by
    Meredith Quartermain. ISBN 0-731521-0-9.  $10.00 plus $2.50 p & p.

        I like the quickness and dedicated flittingness of Meredith's responses,
    so determined to alight on Robin's syllabics.  They're stunning.  A
    spring-coiled peck from Dickinson on the pitch-perfect cheek of Marianne
    Moore. (Daniel Comiskey)

      An amazing, even jaw dropping performance . . . . her poems absolutely
    stand up to the challenge of Blaser's own . . . . The sum of it is totally
    exhilarating. . . . (Ron Silliman)

      A Thousand Mornings.  Prose poems about daily life in Vancouver's oldest
    neighbourhood by Meredith Quartermain. ISBN 0-9731521-2-5. $14.00 plus $2.50
    p & p.

        Meredith Quartermain has really struck gold with A Thousand Mornings, a
    serious-playful and engaging work in which she weighs and sounds what
    presents itself outside a real window, inside language, and through
    verbal-emotional associations. Written in pointillist phrases, diaristic,
    notational, associative, punning, funning and just following any track, the
    work sits down to itself: to the world, and to the self in time. It
    considers all the little bits and details of domestic life and the thinking
    these can engender.  "Looking out of the window of my room is a window
    looking out my head."  This work creates an osmotic border between seeing
    and writing, a realist hypnogogic passage between memory and today, between
    outside and inside, between now and then.  That anywhere is everywhere is
    proven once again with this brave, enchanting book.

The Mainstream Poets are happy to sponsor a forgotten classic, "Olives" by
Orrick Johns.  Written in 1915, it appeared alongside Mina Loy’s "Love Songs"
in William Carlos Williams’s magazine, Others. Williams mentions it as causing
a minor sensation in his Autobiography (specifically the "Blue Undershirts"
section).  A revised, and it seems to us less bold, version appeared in Johns’s
book Black Branches under the title "Tunings."  Johns is well worth checking
out!  His poetry is all over the map but some of it, including this poem,
exhibits a wonderfully bizarre combination of sincerity and stupidity not seen
again until some of the New York Schoolies tried on a similar tone.  Very
Mainstream!  Happy reading...

Joel, etc., on Portland, Beaverton --

It's nutria, or nutrea.  They came from the bayou, and from there from S.
America.  They have done something to the marshland of Beaverton and helped in
its degeneration.

Beaverton's city line touches Portland's, and they are contiguous (not
continuous), but Beaverton has its own mayor, own city hall, and is in a
different county.  Beaverton's county is the richest in all of Oregon by far,
but has the least sidewalks per capita of any county in Oregon.  It is a
sprawling ugly mess -- the price I think that Oregon paid for keeping Portland
beautiful -- the concrete tumor that sprouted to its west is the spillover
from Portland.  I'm not sure of that, it's just a guess.  The place is so
poorly planned that getting ten minutes in any direction is a pain in the neck
-- bottle-necks, lack of sidewalks, everything is ugly as sin.  It is probably
a largely Republican county, while Portland is largely Democrat, I think.  The
greenpeace people should go and have a look at it and explain what on earth
happened.  There are still farms out there, but sometimes you get a barn with
condos and malls on all four sides within rock-throwing distance.

One of the most amazing nightmares is a store called NATURE -- surrounded by
an oily gas-stained swamp, and in the swamp are nutria that people throw
organic crackers to on their way back to their cars.  There are about ten feet
of grass before the swamp begins, and there is a picnic table on that ten
feet, and it is actually listed as a park.  In this park live nothing but
nutria.  I believe that most people think these creatures are beaver, but no,
they are nutria.  You can eat them, but I don't know anybody who does, or
has.  What do they taste like?  I read an article that in New Orleans a few
restaurants have tried to serve them.

Some day drive out west through Beaverton -- it is surreal -- you go from the
planned and well-kept Portland -- European -- through a very small tunnel, and
you pop out and you are in mall-land.  Another fifteen minutes on the highway
and you are in a nice older town called Hillsboro, and then you hit forest,
and mountain, until you get to the beach.  The beach towns probably aren't all
fake, but like the East coast, the fish are mostly gone.  Some trawlers now
use fifty mile long nets and since Charles Olson's time 95% of the fish have
vanished.

A Washington Post news service article of May 15, 2003 says that "much of the
decline can be attributed to the advent of 'longline fishing,' perfected by
the Japanese, in which up to 60 miles of fishing lines bearing thousands of
hooks are trailed behind a single boat.  On the open ocean, the study found,
those catches typically declined ten-fold -- from about ten fish to just one
-- in the first decade of fishing...

   In the Gulf of Thailand, for example, 60 percent of the large finfish,
sharks and skates disappeared during the first five years of industrialized
trawl fishing in the 1960s.  Along the narrow continental shelf near South
Georgia Island in the South Atlantic, where large predatory fish once were
plentiful, virtually all had disappeared after just two years of intensive
fishing in the 1970s...

Fully 90 % of each of the world's large ocean species, including cod, halibut,
tuna, swordfish, and marlin, has disappeared from the world's oceans in recent
decades, accodring to the Canadian analysis -- the first ot use historical
data going back to the beginnings of large-scale fishing in the 1950s"

-- the article is signed by Rick Weiss.

When you think of this depletion it puts Charles Olson's romanticism of the
fishing trade in Gloucester into perspective.  Olson's poem begins with an
evocation of Oregon, as somehow pristine.  But he doesn't write about them, he
praises the men of Gloucester.  OF course, those men were not using fifty mile
long nets.  I'm not sure if that's even legal any more in this country -- it
shouldn't be,but the pond-raised variety make a big sewage problem..  It also
makes you wonder if eating fish is still kosher, so to speak, at all  -- more
kosher than eating beef, from the political perspective.  Just because we
can't see them, or notice their disappearance, or hear their screams as we eat
them.  But what are we going to eat?  I personally hate spinach, because it
causes kidney stones.

In Beaverton, should people be eating these nutria?  They';re cute in a
nightmarish kind of way -- the orange teeth are bizarre.  It must be some kind
of bacteria on the teeth, but they look nuclear.  It's funny to look at them.
Could poetry be written about such a scene?

Funny world this industrialization has caused.  Everything is so efficient.
It's good that at least the Canyonlands are pristine.  I want to see those
soon.  I made a mental note.  Eco-tourism and poetry -- another
problem/solution -- to which I haven't got the faintest clue.   Go and look at
Beaverton and feel funny -- it's as important as the Canyonlands, in that
respect.  When you get there, try to walk three miles, and see what I mean.
At least you won't get jumped -- everybody's rich -- and the only thing likely
to nibble at you or notice you is the nutria.  They look up out of the gaseous
swamps and eye you with considerable interest as they eat up whatever they can
still find in the marshes.

This, the sixth installment of The Constant Critic (http://www.constantcritic.com), sees Christine Hume sitting it out as a preview of her final departure after next month; critic, professor, and poet Joyelle McSweeney will be stepping in to fill her big shoes. Fond farewells and hellos all around. Also:

Jordan Davis on Lee Ann Brown's The Sleep That Changed Everything: "In the vexed and mainly irrelevant arena of allegiances to teachers and predecessors, Brown has pioneered a refreshing indifference to the rivalries between, say, Beats and New York School poets, or New York School poets and practitioners of projective verse, or for that matter between the language poets and the rest of the world. Collaging her influences from all these groups, collaborating with them, trimming her work with declarations that her attraction's more than textual, she is a central figure to many groups of younger poets."

Raymond McDaniel on Monica Youn's Barter: "As a metaphor, of course, clarity fails. This idea that the language of which poetry is made exists optimally as a transparent sheet, a substance through which Something Other can best be appreciated—this sets a recursive fuse, a logical threat that eventually unwinds to detonate the very idea of language itself. If the poetry is not the Something Other, if poetry is merely a scrim the opacity of which is to be damned and the transparency of which is to be praised, then we'd best hang a "closed" sign on the shop of paraphrase and retire to a dim future doctored up with all kinds of human sentiments the details of which have been known for thousands of years and to everyone's utter boredom."

Yeah.  As Miekal knows, I'm a taxonomaniacal close
definer most of the time, but in this case, I just
wanted names of people who use their poetry
significantly to push environmental concerns, and
wasn't sure what to call them.  I at first had
ecological poets, and later thought of eco-poets.
Ecocentric Poets?

Hot Springs Thermophilic Bacteria


We went back up the mountains south of Wilkes-Barre to the destroyed town
of Laurel Run. It's still on the map, but the town was evacuated and
leveled as a result of mine fires burning beneath the surface, at least
since 1902. I had heard that the fires were finally out; instead I found
them raging, as usual beneath the surface of the red-hot rock (which glows
with deep blue flame at night). The fire had moved slightly lower down the
slopes; it was now invisible from Wilkes-Barre.

The signs said Laurel Run and Laurel Run Estates, leading nowhere. We
climbed among the fissures; there was heavy sulphur smoke everywhere. As
usual, the trees in the area were fallen and charred. The signs were there
- of a furious and uncanny conflagration.

Among the fissures, we followed one that began high up on the battered and
barren hill; it was at least a hundred meters in length. Half-way down was
the hottest zone; smoke was everywhere.

I examined the rocks and secondary fissures closely. There were odd
patches of yellow, white, blue, green. Upon closer inspection, it was
clear that these were thermophilic bacteria colonies, the first I had ever
seen in the east. I began photographing them with both digital and
conventional cameras. How did they get there? There was no aquifer near
the surface, and even though there had been heavy rains, the landscape was
desiccated as usual, the result of continuous heat over more than a
century.

Now I will examine and report the find to the local geological society.
Who knows how many new bacteria may exist there! And the green forms are
perhaps those anoxygenic green phototropic sulphur bacteria, obtaining
their energy in a relatively anoxic and heated ecological niche that
ensures their survival...

Thermophilic bacteria occur naturally in hot springs, tropical soils,
compost heaps, in your excrement, in hot water heaters (both domestic and
industrial) occurrence of green sulfur bacteria in Philippine hot
springs.that at least five springs are extensively inhabited by
thermophilic green sulfur Thermophilic bacteria in hot springs are the
oldest life forms on earth and therefore contain a number of essential

I like this -  Solar Thermophillia as different from Magma Thermophillia =
the polar difference between father and mother love. A speculation here

I was going to mention Coach House. A year ago, while visiting a friend in
Toronto, I thought of stopping by Coach House Books. I decided they'd
probably be too busy and they only knew me through a few comps I'd sent
them. A few months later I phoned in an order, mentioned I'd been in
Toronto, and the staff said I should have stopped by. Next time I'm in
Toronto, I will.

My favorite "pilgrimage" site over the years has been City Lights Books.
I'll be going there later this summer, for the first time since 1990. In the
1960's, Wilentz's Eighth Street Book Shop in Manhattan was a must-visit.
Greenwich Village doesn't seem the same without it.

In Hartford, CT the best bookstores are history and the chains are in the
burbs. Mark Twain's house is worth a visit, if only to note the pool table
in front of his writing desk.
I wonder if he got blocked often enough to become a good shot.

Books & Books in Miami, FL, supports a number of literary activities and its
owner, Mitch Kaplan, has a genuine respect for writers. It might not have
the historic qualities of other places mentioned in this thread, but it's a
place that appreciates books as well as sells them---a welcome break from
the chain stores that have inspired so many writers to forge  literary
subcultures online. For that alone, it's worth a visit.

talan memmott, alan sondheim, azure carter and i made a pilgrimage to
coach house last year in may during a conference. as i recall there
was a beautiful chestnut tree outside the building, which was a
lovely funky garage (coach house i guess) on an alley in back of a
row of brick houses.  and a picnic table. we sat at it and then
eventually went in for a tour.  it was great. they showed us the
letter press and said that the letters were stencilled pieces of
metal (i know there are technical terms for these things but i can't
remember them) and they each had a different weight and sound when
they fell, so a blind printer could tell what was being printed by
the sound sequence of the letters falling!!! talk about sound poetry
that was so cool. they gave and sold us books and were supernice and
it really felt good, it was a sunny day too so it was a wonderful
excursion and break from the conference.

hmm...blue undershirts and black branches...something very
objective-correlativy about this juxtaposition...one is tempted to
throw in a deflationary pair of red or white underpants...

Wow, I own Black Branches and his other book, Asphalt, but signed? Jealous! As
I said, Johns is a peculiar figure, poetically and autobiographically.  Had a
wooden leg, committed suicide.  The poems range from sort of neo-Romantic to
uncomfortable minstrelsy ("Dat ol' gal's de dancin' kid..."), to NY Dada --
totally un-anthologizable and so he disappears.  But someone should write about
him.  In a way, he may be the best example of the *transitional* quality of the
NY poetry scene of the teens and twenties.   -m.

hello all,

i'm trying to locate an interview with andy warhol (possibly conducted
by gerard malanga but i can't be sure), likely published in an art or
film magazine, and very likely within six months prior to february
1968. i've been able to follow up on a few citations i've found but
none of them have panned out. none of the catalogs of or critical
writings on warhol that i've seen come with anything like an extensive
bibliography either. any suggestions or leads (backchannel) appreciated!

thanks,
tom orange

It was my understanding that he ran with Harry Kemp, the infamous
Provincetown poet who lived on the beach....

So far, nobody on this list has mentioned Michael Rothenberg, an =
excellent poet and novelist. His readings qualify as performance poetry. =
Last year, Rothenberg released UNDER THE SPELL, a CD on which he recites =
his poetry with the accompaniment of percussionist Bobby Thomas.=20

Although he isn't well known as an ecological activist, Rothenberg's =
excellent poetry collections and his inventive mystery novel, PUNK =
ROCKWELL, reflect his ecological concerns. His friendships with Philip =
Whalen and Joanne Kyger developed through shared concerns about the =
environment, as well as their literary interests. Without making himself =
a public figure, Rothenberg, who grows Bromeliads and Orchids in =
California, has been active and successful in a number of initiatives to =
preserve the California environment over the past thirty years. Although =
he hasn't sought public attention for his contributions, Rothenberg has =
contributed as much behind the scenes as a number of more visible =
environmental activists.=20

The quote, as I remember it, is:

Here's two possibilities:
"Andy Warhol Interviewed by Gerard Malanga"
KULCHUR, Winter 1964/65

"My Favorite Superstar: Notes on My Epic, 'Chelsea
Girls'"
ARTS MAGAZINE, February 1967

These were in the selected bibliography of "Warhol"
by David Bourdon (Abrams, 1989)

Probably one of the best interviews with Warhol is
"Sunday With Mr. C. An Audio-Documentary by Andy
Warhol Starring Truman Capote"
ROLLING STONE #132  April 12, 1973

I haven't found a better bookstore, particularly for small press
hard-to-find works, than Woodland Pattern in Milwaukee. It's a treasure of
the best kind. All kinds of readings, workshops, and events occur there,
and it's a center for experimental music as well. Their gallery  has some
fantastic exhibitions, too. A long time ago, when I lived in Madison,
Wisconsin, it was necessary to go to Woodland Pattern once a month or so.
Ask to see what's tucked away in the drawers, too.  720 E. Locust St.,
Milwaukee.

(now we're all going to talk about our favorite
hometown bookstores):

but to add plus one to the "Albany is Cool" message a
little while back from David, I have to plug the
poor-student institution Dove and Hudson Books. It's
located on (how was that Malevich exhibit again?) the
corner of Dove and Hudson. Hmm.

but absolutely supports the underfunded writer:
anything you want from obscure and out of print (it
was my source for Anais Nin's writings before "Henry
and June" came out and it was all rereleased) to the
cheap resale of new titles (I got the Joris/Rothenberg
anthology for $10 there, plus collected WCW for the
same, etc etc).

The owner is great, they'll look for anything for you.
You always get purple money ($1 for every ten you
spend) and they have great hours (though closed during
the Albany league baseball games)!

when you next visit Albany--soon and often that
colonized capital, forget-me-bird, angel, anchored,
ache--remember: easy to find on a map.

Joseph Chaiken, founder of the Open Theater is dead.
Chaiken changed the concept of theater from a
personality driven, essentially bourgiois enterprise,
to a truely ensemble concept of creating images and
ideas out of the whole rather than its parts. Open
theater productions were characterized by their
physical vitality and their striking imagery, by
acting that embodied large and complex truths.
The Open Theater enterprise changed how we think about
theater forever, and Chaiken's gifts will stay with
everyone who experienced them.

C-Span is providing another Senator Byrd beauty versus the lies in the Bush.
Definitely earning his Federal Pension.  Tune in for the repeats.

MoveOn.org primary took me several attempts to get in virtual line.
A "virtual primary" is an interesting term.
I did my virtuous best!
Frankly - if anyone is interested - I wrote in Gen Wesley Clark to give
Rumsfeld a kick in the mirror.
He may also be the only one who can provide the timber to dwarf the Bushes -

Garden Raided at Sacramento Mobilization!

Last night I watched in tears as fifty riot cops surrounded the Ron
Mandella Community Garden, where my friends and permaculture buddies
were locked down. We stood under the harsh lights and waited, knowing
they were locked to each other and being cut apart, hoping and praying
they would not be hurt. Erik, Eileen, Abby, Matt, and others from Sonoma
county and our Earth Activist trainings were among them. Now they are on
hunger strike in jail. As part of the protest against the biotech and
corporate agriculture miniministerial convened here in Sacramento by the
USDA and USAID, they decided to defend the alternative‹a community
garden confiscated to be developed for condos.
Earlier in the week, in a raid on the Welcome Center of the Sacramento
Mobilization for Food Sovereignty, Democracy and Justice, police had
confiscated seed balls produced in a permaculture weapons, claiming they
could be used as projectile weapons, and were shown on the night time
news demo. Why is the city of Sacramento portraying organic gardening as
a dangerous and threatening activity‹while supporting the poisonous
agriculture practices and dangerous technologies promoted by the
mini-ministerial?
Please make the calls suggested below. Let¹s free the gardeners and the
garden!
For more infomation on the garden, see www.freethegarden.org.
For more information on the Sacramento Mobilization, see
www.sacmobilization.org.

Please call the District Attorney, Jan Scully, and demand that charges
be dropped and the gardeners be released! 916-874-6218.

Call Steve Westly, the State Controller at (916) 445-2636, and demand
that the state return control of the garden to the people, and end
funding for the Fremont Mews Development.

And call Mayor Heather Fargo and the Sacto City Council. (916) 808-5407,
and tell them that Sacramento needs the Ron Mandella Community Garden.

And please send this message on to other gardeners and permaculturists.
Let's let Sacramento hear from gardeners around the world that we want
them to support small scale, community based agriculture, not
profit-driven toxic ag!

I would suggest our fine city Columbus

as it is the 13th largest in the US& the cheapest by far

Friends of mine pay 300-425 a month for rent for a single bedroom
2-500 for a two bedroom,
our mortgage is under five hundred a month for a three bedroom house.
600 a year full coverage car insurance, & so on
I work about 200 hours a year to cover my expenses

Culturally there is much going on on here
great rock music scene all my friends from both coasts float thru
best movie set ups I've seen
plenty of writers, an odd mix of people genre wise
Poetry -wise we have had a few hundred people read for us in the past
two years including Simon Perchik, Jimmy Santiago Baca, CD Wright,
Sheila Murphy, & others.

the only disadvantage is you need a car. But they do not inspect them
for windshields or emissions or anything except to match up the vin
numbers.


Be well

I used to love and still love these two lines by Orrick Johns:

"They are unholy who are born to love wild plums at night,
Who once have passed them on the road glimmering and white."

I don't know the poem anymore that that is from -- maybe called Wild Plums.
I haven't heard Orrick Johns' name ever before in any kind of discussion,
and the last time I thought about him was twenty years ago at least. I
didn't know he was so tied in to modernist groups. I had the impression that
he had committed suicide -- this may have been on the back of a volume of
poems I had of his that I got out of the Portland Public Library decades
back.  Oh, speaking of pilgrimages -- the lobby of the Portland Oregon
public library is really dazzling -- black marble as I recall, with
inscriptions of Oregon history cut into the marble in a giant winding
staircase that goes up four or five floors.  Are there really wagon trains
cut in marble, or is that my memory playing tricks on me?

Very interesting and even, umm, emitting of hope -- this piece below is
penned by no less a despicable fellow than Pat Buchanan.  Still, it =
does
perhaps reflect some promising potential fracturing of the "them" that =
fill
the world with so much fear and loathing...

Copyright =A9 2003 The American Conservative
Is the Neoconservative Moment Over?
by Pat Buchanan
The salad days of the neoconservatives, which began with the =
president's
Axis-of-Evil address in January 2002 and lasted until the fall of =
Baghdad
may be coming to an end. Indeed, it is likely the neoconservatives will
never again enjoy the celebrity and cachet in which they reveled in =
their
romp to war on Iraq.=20
While this is, admittedly, a prediction, it rests on reasonable =
assumptions.
But why should neoconservatism, at the apparent apex of its influence, =
be on
the edge of eclipse?=20
Answer: the high tide of neoconservatism may have passed because the =
high
tide of American empire may have passed. "World War IV," the empire =
project,
the great cause of the neocons, seems to have been suspended by the
President of the United States.=20
While we still hear talk of "regime change" in Iran and North Korea, =
U.S.
forces not tied down in occupation duties by the anarchy and chaos in =
Iraq,
are returning home.=20
The first signal that the apogee of American hegemony in the Middle =
East has
been reached came as U.S. soldiers and marines were completing their
triumphant march into Baghdad. Suddenly, all the bellicosity toward =
Syria
from neoconservatives and the Pentagon, stopped, apparently on the =
orders of
the Commander in Chief.=20
Secretary of State Powell announced he would go to Damascus to talk =
with
President Assad. U.S. ground forces halted at the Syrian border. Our
carriers began to sail home from the Gulf. All the talk of Iraqi war
criminals hiding out in Syria and Saddam's weapons of mass destruction =
being
transferred there suddenly ceased. "Mission Accomplished" read the huge
banner on the Abraham Lincoln, as the president landed on the carrier =
deck
to address the nation.=20
When Newt Gingrich, before an audience at the American Enterprise =
Institute
(AEI), launched his tirade against Powell and the Department of State,
accusing them of appeasing Syria, no echo came out of the Pentagon.
Reportedly, Karl Rove gave Newt an earful, and the president himself =
was
prepared to blast Newt, for he saw the attack on Powell as an attack on =
his
own policy. A few editorials and columns praised Newt, but the neocons =
could
sense that they were no longer in step with the White House. So, too, =
did
every other Kremlinologist in this city.=20
Why did Bush order an end to the threats to Syria? The answer is =
obvious. He
is not prepared to carry them out. With the heavy fighting over in
Afghanistan and Iraq, the American people have had enough of invasions =
and
occupations for one presidential term. The United States is now deep =
into
nation building in both countries.=20
Moreover, Syria is not under any UN sanctions. Its leader did not try =
to
assassinate the president's father. There is no evidence Damascus is =
working
on nuclear weapons. Assad has not threatened us. A war on Syria would =
have
no Security Council endorsement, no NATO allies, no authorization from
Congress. Such a pre-emptive war would be unconstitutional and be seen
abroad as the imperial war of a rogue superpower. For all the talk of
unilateralism and of our "unipolar moment" President Bush clearly feels =
a
need for allies, foreign and domestic, before launching such a war.=20
Finally, having assumed paternity of 23 million Iraqis, few Americans =
are
anxious to adopt 17 million Syrians. Damascus is a bridge too far for =
Bush
and Rove, and with two wars and two victories in two years, why press =
their
luck? The re-election that the president's father did not win-and not =
an
empire-appears to be what they are about.=20
Therefore, for the foreseeable future, the glory days-of Special Forces
galloping on horseback in the Afghan hills, of Abrams tanks dashing =
like
Custer's cavalry across the Iraqi desert, of statues of Saddam toppling =
into
the streets of Baghdad, and presidents landing on carrier flight decks =
in
fighter-pilot garb -are over, behind us, gone.=20
And ahead? Like all empires, once they cease to expand, they go over =
onto
the defensive. Like the Brits before us, we must now secure, =
consolidate,
protect, manage, and rule what we have in the tedious aftermath of our
imperial wars. And as we have seen in the terror attacks in Casablanca =
and
Riyadh, al-Qaeda and its allies, not Tommy Franks, now decide the time =
and
place of attack in the War on Terror.=20
With 25 U.S. soldiers dead and counting since Baghdad fell, what the =
empire
now entails is a steady stream of caskets coming home from Afghanistan =
and
Iraq and tens of billions of American tax dollars going the other way =
to pay
the cost of reconstruction of countries we have defeated and occupied.=20
Victory has brought unanticipated headaches. Having smashed the forces =
that
held Iraq together-Saddam's regime, the Ba'ath Party, the Republican =
Guard,
the army-we must now build new forces to police the country, hold it
together, and protect it from its predatory neighbors. And there are =
Islamic
and Arab elements in and outside of Iraq determined that we should =
fail.=20
Where Tehran and the mullahs colluded in our smashing of a Taliban they
hated, and of their old enemy Saddam, they no longer welcome America's
massive military presence in their region.=20
Most important, it appears the president has shifted roles from war =
leader
to peacemaker. While the neocons are adamant in rejecting the road map =
to
peace, drafted by the "quartet"-the U.S., the EU, the UN, and Russia-as =
a
threat to Israel's survival, Bush has endorsed it and evidently means =
to
pursue it. The neocons are already carping at him for pressuring Sharon =
to
"negotiate with terrorists" and "creating a new terrorist state in the
Middle East." Where White House and neoconservative agendas coincided
precisely in the invasion of Iraq, they are now clearly in conflict.=20
While it has not happened yet, there is the possibility that our effort =
at
nation building in Iraq will falter and fail, that Americans will tire =
of
pouring men and money into the project, and will demand that the =
president
bring the troops home and turn Iraq over to the allies, the Arabs, or =
the
UN. As one looks at Afghanistan, Iraq, and a Middle East where al-Qaeda =
is
avidly seeking soft targets, it may be that all the good news is behind =
us
and that only bad news lies ahead.=20
If we have hit the tar baby in Baghdad, the president may be seeking to
extricate us before we go to the polls 17 months from now. And should =
the
fruits of victory start to rot, Americans will begin to ask questions =
of the
principal propagandists for war.=20
It was, after all, the neocons who sold the country on the notion that =
Iraq
had a huge arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, that Iraq was behind
9/11, that Saddam had ties to al-Qaeda, that the war would be a =
"cakewalk,"
that we would be welcomed as liberators, that victory would bring =
democratic
revolution in the Middle East. Should the cream go sour, the neocons =
will
face the charge that they "lied us into war."=20
Moreover, for a movement that is small in number and utterly dependent =
on
its proximity to power, the neocons have made major mistakes. They have
insulted too many U.S. allies, boasted too much of their connections =
and
influence, attracted too much attention to themselves, and antagonized =
too
many adversaries. In this snake pit of a city, their over-developed =
penchant
for self-promotion is not necessarily an asset.=20
By now, all their columnists and house organs-Commentary, National =
Review,
the New Republic, the Weekly Standard-are known. Their front =
groups-AEI,
JINSA-have all been identified and bracketed. Their agents of
influence-Perle, Wolfowitz, Feith, Libby, Bolton, Wurmser, Abrams, et
alia-have all been outed. Neoconservatives are now seen as separate and
apart from the Bush loyalists, with loyalties and an agenda all their =
own.=20
If Americans decide they were lied to, that the Iraqi war was not =
fought for
America's interests, that its propagandists harbored a hidden agenda-as =
they
decided after World War I and exposure of the "merchants of death"-they =
will
know exactly whom to blame and whom to hold accountable.=20
The weakness of the neocons is that, politically speaking, they are
parasites. They achieve influence only by attaching themselves to =
powerful
hosts, be it "Scoop" Jackson, Ronald Reagan, or Rupert Murdoch. When =
the
host dies or retires, they must scramble to find a new one. Thus, they =
have
blundered in isolating themselves from and alienating almost every =
other
once-friendly group on the Right.=20
Consider the lurid charges laid against all three founding editors of =
this
magazine and four of our writers-Sam Francis, Bob Novak, Justin =
Raimondo,
and Eric Margolis-by National Review in its cover story, "Unpatriotic
Conservatives." Of us, NR writes,=20
        They ... excuse terror. They espouse ... defeatism. ... And some of
them explicitly yearn for the victory of their nation's enemies. ...=20
        Only the boldest of them ... acknowledge their wish to see the
United States defeated in the War on Terror. But they are thinking =
about
defeat, and wishing for it, and they will take pleasure in it should it
happen.
        They began by hating the neoconservatives. They came to hate their
party and their president. They have finished by hating their country.
This screed does not come out of the National Review of Kirk, Burnham, =
and
Meyer we grew up with. It is the language of the radical Left and
Trotskyism, the spawning pools of neoconservatism. And rather than =
confirm
the neocons as leaders of the Right, such bile betrays their origins =
and
repels most of the Right. One wonders if the neocons even know how many =
are
waiting in hopeful anticipation of their unhorsing and humiliation.=20
"There is no telling how far a man can go, as long as he is willing to =
let
someone else get the credit," read a plaque Ronald Reagan kept in his =
desk.
The neocons' problem is that they claim more credit than they deserve =
for
Bush's War and have set themselves up as scapegoats if we lose the =
peace.=20
Having enjoyed the prerogative of the courtesan, influence without
accountability, the neocons may find themselves with that worst of all
worlds, responsibility without power.  <<...OLE_Obj...>>=20

I like these lines - a nice juxtaposition with WCW - his own domestic
version of Johns' wild plums where instead finds them sumptuously waiting on
a plate in the fridge!
It is curious that John's would label the men as "unholy" - in light of this
googled up story of plums and holiness:
((from Thingazar Sayadaw's story 14,  Burmese Monk's Tales)
Prologue: One morning, after the learned monks had eaten the alms food
offered by him, King Mindon bewailed the fact that not one among his
teachers had become an arahat. "My lords," said the king, ''I build you fine
monasteries and I offer you aIms food regularly. In return, you do show me
the way to piety, but I feel poorly recompensed, for no one among my lords
has striven enough to reach the state of arahatship." All the other monks
remained silent, but the Thingazar Sayadaw could not let the king's
criticism pass unchallenged. "Your Majesty," he replied, "we are aloft the
plum tree and you are criticizing us from the ground."

"Plum crazy" I guess another word for Holy in some realms.

Re Portland, Kirby, I suggest you look up the work of Robert Adams, if you
have not; he is one of this country's great photographers and, one might
say, an elegiac documentry artist of the west, also a literary guy. His
photographs of the suburbanization/sprawl of Denver are hauntingly lonely in
their human and spatial witness - a luminous Edward Hopper. His photographs
of the Columbia River gorge and the clear cutting of Oregon forests carry a
double punch - he has an incredible sense of illumination and beauty in
contest inside pervasive devastation.
He's undoubtedly in the Photography collection at the Portland Museum. The
photo curator there - Terry Tottenmeyer (sp?) - makes great black and white
photographs of the Basalt caves and shapes that bluff out and drop off the
Oregon coastline. He risks his butt by getting out under them to shoot
during low tides. If you want an aesthetic experience of magma darkness he's
got it in spades.

sometime we should aid the world in killing
human scum that populates the earth -
there's nothing that could be more thrilling
than human slaughter - beginning first with birth
and moving upward - no one spared the knife
or poison bullet which will do the trick
in taking care of this pest and its life
creating chaos - illness - driving fauna sick
as victims rove as if they were a shunt
from one horrific moment to the next -
while there's no stopping humans from the hunt -
it's built into our genes - our muscles flex
to take us out before it's much too late
for holocaust - and victims' guilt bears fate

Steve:

I'm assuming that the wild plums in question are the beach plums that grow
at the edge of every undisturbed beach in the northeast. My reading (not of
course knowing the rest of the poem) is that the sight of them renders the
viewer unholy--wild, pagan, bewitched--snatched from one realm into
another. But I tend to see the liminal everywhere.

Mark, I would be the last one needed to persuade you that the "unholy"
(wild, pagan, bewitched--snatched from one realm into
> another.) may also be perceived by others as quite "Holy."  It's the old
argument that pits the devout religious "expressionists" against the formal &
restrained ones. Puritans versus holy rollers, etc.
Plums are clearly a great and consuming trigger for some - off to a good
start this summer in California (sweet & voluptuous) as different from
bitter in some summers past.
 "But I tend to see the liminal everywhere" Does that mean you get off to an
"other" - maybe sacred space -  on the mere sight of plums?

I am getting plum or something crazy here so I leave with the purest
information I can on what might have been Johns' plums in 1915, as well as
the origins and history of non-native American plums, as well as the WCW:

1.    Prunus italica (greengages), which are still found wild in Asia Minor
and were possibly introduced to northern Europe by the Romans. They
disappeared entirely from Europe in the Middle Ages and were not
reintroduced until the 18th century.
2.    Prunus salicina and Prunus triflora (Japanese plums), which are
larger, cone-shaped, mild and sweet, and range in color from gold to
orange-red.
3.    Prunus institia (damsons), which originated in Damascus, Syria, and
were brought to Europe during the Crusades, in the 12th century--possibly by
the French Duc d'Anjou after his pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
4.    Prunus cerasifera (cherry plums, or myrobalan), which originated in
the Balkans, Caucasus, and Western Asia and were introduced to England in
the 16th century--thence to the New World.
5.    Prunus maritima (American beach plums), which are native to the U.S.
and were consumed by Native Americans before being adopted by European
Settlers.
6.    Prunus americana (wild plums), which are native to North America.

"This is Just to Say" (1934):

I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox

and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast

Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold

WCW

(Pagan or Holy what plum bit of difference does it make?)

Places to live: =20

=20

Beaverton, OR 1962 B.N. - Before we talk of places fit to live, I must =
first reminisce with you and take you back in time to a Beaverton of =
yesterday, to a quiet village snuggled in the rolling green countryside =
between the hustle and bustle of an expanding Portland metropolis and =
the vast woodlands and meadows stretching west southwestward toward the =
rocky black sand of the Oregon coast.  I take you to a quiet Beaverton, =
to a Beaverton Before Nike.=20

=20

Close your eyes and imagine with me gravel lanes meandering through =
meadows lush with pasture grasses; imagine also small home sites cut =
carefully into the edge of the dense forests, and picture in all this =
verdant splendor, swift gushing streams filled with diamond clear =
mountain runoff waters swirling with young trout.  Here, in this nearly =
perfect, Camelot of settings sits Beaverton. =20

=20

Small ranches, small orchards, family farmers and members of the local =
logging company's crews, all dwelling side by side in a kind of harmonic =
somnambulant existence.this is Beaverton, OR  B.N.=20

*          *            *            *            *            *         =
   *         =20

=20

It's amazing, when you actually stop and look over the landscape while =
it is being plundered, how much earth a bulldozer can shove aside in an =
hour.  But what is even more amazing is how bulldozers can reshape the =
contours of the land, how they can change the quiet character of a =
village and turn it into a strip-mall circus. =20

=20

Bulldozers reshaped Beaverton.   But, why did the bulldozers come?  What =
forces possessed the power to direct these huge machines to turn the =
idyllic countryside into a home for poorly designed shops, offices, =
motels, shopping centers, and cluster-styled (or should that be =
clutter-styled?) California housing developments?   =20

=20

Enter technology and the host of shoes to come!

=20

I have neither time nor space in this brief note to provide the details =
about all the hi-tech companies responsible for bulldozing the Beaverton =
countryside, so I must focus on one, the one I believe most responsible =
for the devastation: Nike. =20

=20

Nike."just do it," they said, and they did exactly that.   Nike hit =
Beaverton like the marines hitting the beaches at Tarawa. =20

=20

Oh, there were no cannons or rockets, bombs or machine guns; there were =
worse: architects and contractors, designers, engineers and heavy =
equipment operators.  They arrived in droves.  They planned, then they =
developed.  At least that what they called it.development. =20

=20

And when they had finished, the lazy country lanes which had once =
meandered through meadows were transformed into four and six lane =
thoroughfares connecting one strip mall center with another. =20

=20

Funny, too, for all that expense and planning, one must point out the =
simple fact of the failure.  The thoroughfares are so glutted with =
vehicles that traffic moves at a pace less rapid than when the cars =
traveled over the gravel-topped country roads. =20

=20

The highlight of all the changes to the typography is the Nike =
Headquarters compound.  Here, architects, contractors, designers and =
engineers  took the natural beauty of the countryside and created a kind =
of Southwestern styled hacienda complex.  I don't mean in terms of the =
adobe appearance of an old hacienda; I am referring to the design of the =
hacienda complex.remember how they were planned: the outer walls of the =
building formed a barricade around the perimeter of the casa.  There was =
of course an entry gate, but life in the hacienda existed within the =
walls of the structure, and the residents could escape the horrors and =
the difficulties of the outside world by retreating into the inner =
sanctum of the hacienda's walled safety.=20

=20

Nike workers escape the fears of the surrounding area by driving through =
the gates that lead into the compound.  Once inside, they are safe and =
need fear no wrath from the local Beaverton residents who failed to move =
away in time and escape the onslaught of the Nike invaders. =20

=20

The Nike compound is closed to outsiders.   We may drive the Nike built =
thoroughfares around the perimeter of the compound, enjoying the ten =
foot high earth walls planted with lush, non-native vegetation, but we =
may not enter the compound. =20

=20

Helicopters from the Portland news broadcasters have invaded the =
airspace over the compound and shared television footage of the grounds, =
the athletic fields, the buildings, and the eighty plus acre lake hidden =
within the walls of the earth berms, but even these films fail to do =
justice to capture feeling of the complex. =20

=20

And this complex has been set in the country amid the development areas, =
the shops, the motels, the office buildings, the subdivisions full of =
houses belonging to the underlings of the Nike organization, and the few =
remaining single family homes belonging to folks who cling to the ideal =
of a Beaverton that was once a delightful place to live and raise a =
family.  Now that was a place fit to live.   =20

=20

=20

=20

=20

=20

Mark, Steve,
I believe the wild plums are often symbols for purity/innocence and =
wisdom? =20

Here, in these lines, the pure has her innocence "shattered" yet she =
remains wise...or at least that was my intention when I wrote the verse =
decades ago. =20

"Young she was, yet strong and wise,

and proudly stood among black branches

of the small, wild plums; her sloe-eyes

wide open to the sweet shattering of pink,"   =20

  I'm assuming that the wild plums in question are the beach plums that =

*The Emancipation of Sound*


the emancipation of sound
(the poems sometimes do) (the traditional ones at
least)
to in the inner ear WE ARE THE for reassembling
language to
enactment of perspective
being to problematize the political and economical
terms that a silly fetish
conceived in the Sartean spirit of using personal
artifacts in a my own life
bondage is not something
writings that are inter-referential
in any of them
template for objectivity and expertise has thus tended
justified demands of commerce
poetry is a very ambitious means for stealing reality
and thus the ability to issue misery
sum total or complex more mongrel than homogeneous
products are affected
no illusion to what I'm experiencing
these people to relate to soul
he gave him kingship in even extremely profitable ends
they complain of what is right and what is ahead
sometimes other vessels
closed worlds vacuums travel along a realist
and just say "blue"
this in its imagining of poets dead before
and respond to it strongly meaningless
individual and mass overproduction cancels shattered
into smaller bits
never valid
so the new poem is the visual enactment of perspective
and difference
whether that is what permits art to the possibility of
on
yet the embodiment is self-consciously
self-set problem
task at hand seems most mysterious
of domains
my body armor
and releases
this and removes is inconclusive
any continuation at all (blank screen)
these words back to the cognition

natural we continue to peruse and reperuse actual

and written usually act upon the writing moment I go
to
A return to B

rain drumming on 'tent roof' house roof overhead
rainbow comes pouring into power
cyber-bureaucracies now operate across a chromatic
spectrum
where who has not undergone that kind of but filth and
poverty
gangsta rap continues to rely on continually
you can never read those words again
is a kind of magic voice
once you've heard contiguities of language
for universal rules of publishing are in constant flux
changing
this is immutable
of memory
and desire
poet gives us
several poems
and we saying only what this lesson will perform
monotonous sameness
goblins await you with welcoming jaws
you had of our psychic pain
this is the promise of reform
soul main democratic functions
namely the timely condensation
kirlian waves that connect me to you
all that we have
of course
and our love for our fellows
without hearing that voice
even if the moon
and most commonplace life experiences
and the activities of time off for staff to work
love returns
the city's all brightness and shadow
deckle-edged
could go
where one life destroy
I'm reiterating the same
which sweeps me
crucial liminal space
where the presumptive limits of exaggeration and
selection
which else in nature that even comes close -
ignorance?
he emphasizes the duty of painting in the whole wide
world
effort have been hand
combines implicates contrasts them
while in & indeed divisiveness is the thing they are
doing
freed from the fetters of matter
poet's own control
the drama of view
of our present and future state
than the activities
now as there are many are enough to illustrate
but that is all he allowed in essence
upon the philosopher in strange raiment
extension in all any measure
by and then only form of some pieces
eye sore act of petty vandalism
sell to your friends
time is impossible to do without a new use
this is the autonomy of style
for what conquest and compulsion
fictions have significant value as commodities
so the injurious vision of the assassin
not to fall into a state of undress
the basilisk of energy
the place essence
approach refers to the the poem
or the special reading that its them
he would give his life
on various influences of global capitalism &
inexplicable
shadows fell heavily to sleep in and the least
particles of all I am not mistaken
and they cause discomfort
to those who hold its apparent social binary
oppositions
thus anything
non-white
non-male
non-heterosexual
non-hygienic
non-rational
are only particles or a set of rules keeping our
mouths shut
as in turn concerned with the difference between right
and wrong
could see the electricity on
a sort of alluvial deposit
electro-surgeons
through all spatial dimensions
glittering gleaming of long absence
the constructive imperative
rather than the position of not-knowing
a forcing of what and how
sometimes I mindfuck his head
attack of migraine
or the reading of a philosophical element
informational flows
shared on the same infrastructural platform
is more experiential or exceptional
the materiality of language
as seen from the Machine
valuable realities of cultures
of releasing their energy into the psyche
one can "enter" a virtual three-dimensional space
to the weight of our fistful of senses

WILD PLUM (the full text):

They are unholy who are born to love wild plum at night,
Who once have passed it on the road glimmering and white.

It is as though the darkness had speech of silver word,
Or as though a cloud of stars perched like ghostly birds.

They are unpitied from their birth and homeless in men's sight,
Who love, better than the earth, wild plum at night.

Orrick John

I found this on the web at

http://www.tc.columbia.edu/taylor/hundley/paper/4.htm

It is at the end of an enormous article on how to turn different poems into
singable songs.  This one is regarded as a "lighthearted" song.  I read it as
really almost scary in its uplift.  It reminds me of something by Rumi, only not
translated into faltering prose.  For some reason it is almost terrifying to me.
When I used to own a book of Orrick Johns' poems, this is the only one that I
cherished.  I must have read it a hundred times.  I then lent it to a psychology
teacher who was teaching a one-week course and he absconded with it.  At the time
I knew nothing about Orrick Johns.  I looked him up and he grew up in Louisville,
and committed suicide at the age of 58.  Nobody knows why.  He had at least four
wives.  He got rich early on from a successful novel.  At the time I used to read
him I thought he was from Oregon, because I used to walk in Oregon orchards at
night and was blown away by how he caught the sense of being lifted in the
moonlight, and the strange glimmering of the white flowers on the fruit trees in
the very bright moonlight.

But as far as I know, Johns lived in the northeast, but did make at least one
long trip to Europe.  I forgot to get the link, but there is a short handwritten
biography of him somewhere on the net.  He's linked to a quite illustrious
family.  I wish I had more biographical details concerning when and where and
about what he wrote this poem.  I don't even know if it was famous in his own
day.  I also wish I knew what the analogy was about -- what are the wild plum to
him, and why do men not pity such folk from their birth?  It must be something
illegal -- child molestation (I hope not, but it would explain the suicide),
homosexuality, or just mysticism in a time of mercantilism?  There are endless
possibilities, or maybe he just found the sight of these actual plants to be
amazing, and there is no analogy at all.  If somebody finds something out, please
say.  I've really enjoyed Mark and Steve's commentary as well as all other
commentary on this poem.  Oddly, there are seven beats in each line.  It is
almost a ghazal -- opening and closing with the word "night" and framed into
couplets, each one of which could stand on its own.

Alexander --

It is amazing to read this text about pristine Beaverton.  It gave me a feeling for the history of the place.  I once saw aerial photographs of Beaverton starting in the 1950s -- it was an enormous photo about five feet by five feet, and they had pictures every five to ten years -- this was in a geographer's office at Portland Community College at Rock Creek where I taught for a year.  To watch the housing spread right up to the city boundary is sickening.  Beaverton is Republican, largely, and I suspect that they did not have the same growth codes as Portland, so that they suffered the nightmare that Portland repressed.  There are a few good things left in Beaverton -- there is a fifty acre park that abuts the light rail  at the
Jenkins Road stop -- connected to it is a quite good ranger's station with a beautiful small bookstore.  Also the new Beaverton library is really spacious and gorgeous inside -- three airy floors, built of huge wooden timbers, filled with new computers (as of two years ago).  Well, those two things sort of exhaust what I had to say that was going to be nice.  Over a soccer field where actual kids play a lot of soccer are ten or so high tension wires.  This is one of the only open parks in all of Beaverton (Nike has parks, and even a full basketball court, but neighborhood residents can't get in there without a pass), and so the kids play under the high tension wires that stretch for miles in both directions.  The kids complain of
headaches.  there is another large park area across from a Fred Meyers but it doesn't have a neighborhood feeling to it -- since a four lane road runs in front of it, and there is no peace.

-- Kirby Olson


> And this complex has been set in the country amid the development areas, the shops, the motels, the office buildings, the subdivisions full of houses belonging to the underlings of the Nike organization, and the few remaining single family homes belonging to folks who cling to the ideal of a Beaverton that was once a delightful place to live and raise a family.  Now that was a place fit to live.

-- You get glimpses of this in the occasional collapsed barn that no one has bothered to move away as of yet.

I spoke to the lady from the Beaverton county planning commission (I forget the name of the county , maybe Washington) about the possibility of a sidewalk on one undeveloped parcel of land so that kids could walk to school.  She said if a new condo unit goes in we'll hit them up for the money.  There are 850 miles of un-sidewalked road in the county, and ten feet of sidewalk cost a thousand dollars, she said, and have to be approved by at least four agencies: environmental, electrical, zoning commissions, etc., gee whiz.  You tangle with so many people when you just want to go for a walk, so it's either planned well at the beginning or just get your luggage and move to the Catskills, as I did.

I passed the Beaverton exits yesterday, on my way home from the Oregon
Coast. I thought to stop in one of the malls, as I need a new pair of hiking
boots." But then I thought, "Naw, I don't want to spend a moment there,
after reading the posts on this list."

Went on to Portland, visiting a friend in the planetarium of Oregon Museum
of Science and Industry. It just got five large computer-controlled
projectors donated. OMSI's one of only eight planetarium's in the world that
has them. My friend's in heaven!

>
>
>
> Beaverton, OR 1962 B.N. - Before we talk of places fit to live, I must
first reminisce with you and take you back in time to a Beaverton of
yesterday, to a quiet village snuggled in the rolling green countryside
between the hustle and bustle of an expanding Portland metropolis and the
vast woodlands and meadows stretching west southwestward toward the rocky
black sand of the Oregon coast.  I take you to a quiet Beaverton, to a
Beaverton Before Nike.
>
>
>
> Close your eyes and imagine with me gravel lanes meandering through
meadows lush with pasture grasses; imagine also small home sites cut
carefully into the edge of the dense forests, and picture in all this
verdant splendor, swift gushing streams filled with diamond clear mountain
runoff waters swirling with young trout.  Here, in this nearly perfect,
Camelot of settings sits Beaverton.
>
>
>
> Small ranches, small orchards, family farmers and members of the local
logging company's crews, all dwelling side by side in a kind of harmonic
somnambulant existence.this is Beaverton, OR  B.N.
>
> *          *            *            *            *            *
*
>
>
>
> It's amazing, when you actually stop and look over the landscape while it
is being plundered, how much earth a bulldozer can shove aside in an hour.
But what is even more amazing is how bulldozers can reshape the contours of
the land, how they can change the quiet character of a village and turn it
into a strip-mall circus.
>
>
>
> Bulldozers reshaped Beaverton.   But, why did the bulldozers come?  What
forces possessed the power to direct these huge machines to turn the idyllic
countryside into a home for poorly designed shops, offices, motels, shopping
centers, and cluster-styled (or should that be clutter-styled?) California
housing developments?
>
>
>
> Enter technology and the host of shoes to come!
>
>
>
> I have neither time nor space in this brief note to provide the details
about all the hi-tech companies responsible for bulldozing the Beaverton
countryside, so I must focus on one, the one I believe most responsible for
the devastation: Nike.
>
>
>
> Nike."just do it," they said, and they did exactly that.   Nike hit
Beaverton like the marines hitting the beaches at Tarawa.
>
>
>
> Oh, there were no cannons or rockets, bombs or machine guns; there were
worse: architects and contractors, designers, engineers and heavy equipment
operators.  They arrived in droves.  They planned, then they developed.  At
least that what they called it.development.
>
>
>
> And when they had finished, the lazy country lanes which had once
meandered through meadows were transformed into four and six lane
thoroughfares connecting one strip mall center with another.
>
>
>
> Funny, too, for all that expense and planning, one must point out the
simple fact of the failure.  The thoroughfares are so glutted with vehicles
that traffic moves at a pace less rapid than when the cars traveled over the
gravel-topped country roads.
>
>
>
> The highlight of all the changes to the typography is the Nike
Headquarters compound.  Here, architects, contractors, designers and
engineers  took the natural beauty of the countryside and created a kind of
Southwestern styled hacienda complex.  I don't mean in terms of the adobe
appearance of an old hacienda; I am referring to the design of the hacienda
complex.remember how they were planned: the outer walls of the building
formed a barricade around the perimeter of the casa.  There was of course an
entry gate, but life in the hacienda existed within the walls of the
structure, and the residents could escape the horrors and the difficulties
of the outside world by retreating into the inner sanctum of the hacienda's
walled safety.
>
>
>
> Nike workers escape the fears of the surrounding area by driving through
the gates that lead into the compound.  Once inside, they are safe and need
fear no wrath from the local Beaverton residents who failed to move away in
time and escape the onslaught of the Nike invaders.
>
>
>
> The Nike compound is closed to outsiders.   We may drive the Nike built
thoroughfares around the perimeter of the compound, enjoying the ten foot
high earth walls planted with lush, non-native vegetation, but we may not
enter the compound.
>
>
>
> Helicopters from the Portland news broadcasters have invaded the airspace
over the compound and shared television footage of the grounds, the athletic
fields, the buildings, and the eighty plus acre lake hidden within the walls
of the earth berms, but even these films fail to do justice to capture
feeling of the complex.
>
>
>
> And this complex has been set in the country amid the development areas,
the shops, the motels, the office buildings, the subdivisions full of houses
belonging to the underlings of the Nike organization, and the few remaining
single family homes belonging to folks who cling to the ideal of a Beaverton
that was once a delightful place to live and raise a family.  Now that was a
place fit to live.

Dear S J Plante:
In response to your Call for Submissions on Poetics, I am enclosing four
poems for your consideration: Cat Poetics (2 poems. There is an essay
that goes with them, but I didn't want to confuse the evaluation process
with mixed genres. I'll be glad to mail or e-mail it to you if you'd like
to see it), On the Bridge, and Poetry Workshop.
Poetry credits include: SHAMPOO16, Miller's Pond Online, Artvoice,
Magazen Sudden, and The Awakenings Review.
I will appear on a Buffalo-area poetry program, Truckstop Intellectuals
in July, and am scheduled as a featured reader at The Screening Room in
Amherst, NY in August.
I hope that at least one of these will appeal to you.
To simplify the response process across the border, could you please
e-mail me your decision and then dispose of any unused pieces?
Thank you.
Sincerely,

Martha L. Deed

Sent by e-mail (without the poems) and by regular mail

One who might join you is Victor Coleman, a sadly too-little-known port of
jreat subtlety and notable production. As Vic d'Or, he flourished in the
70s, which were the Acupulco Golden Age of this press; there was also  a
Dorn-inspired whole lot of snorting going on. But he continues to write as
well or better than ever, and I wish some good soul would get a selected or
collected into print and sell it to the North American market, with the
necessary energy to get our attention. he hasnt split for someplace
affordable way out of town, has he? (Like I have!) In his remarkably quiet
way, he has moved and shaken  things poetic in T.O. for more than 30 years.

You'll probably see Stan Bevington, the founder or some of the others who
have devoted their lives to the place. They'll give you the tour. Buy some
books and then announce that you're heading to the nearest pub for a pint.
Chances are someone will join you, unless there's a big printing deadline.

************************
Modell "the play of similarity and difference that makes transitory or
partial identification possible is a netaphoric process....cognitive
capacity to empathically know other minds relies on an unimpaired faculty
for metaphoric thought"

he goes back to Jacobson's distinction here between metonym and metaphor.

He also goes on to bring in Bakhtin's dialogical imagination, dance and
mirror neurons.  I think it all hangs together but welcome other views.  As
he says, "This would be consistent with the idea, central to this book, that
thought can exist apart from language.  This would also suggest that the
origin of metaphor and the origin of language are not a coincidence but
represent a coevolution."

This thread perplexes me -- if a place lacks a "good bookstore," doesn't =

some mix of proximities -- is suburban development the anti-poem? Poets, =

Alexander --

It is amazing to read this text about pristine Beaverton.  It gave me a =
feeling for the history of the place.  I once saw aerial photographs of =
Beaverton starting in the 1950s -- it was an enormous photo about five =
feet by five feet, and they had pictures every five to ten years -- this =
was in a geographer's office at Portland Community College at Rock Creek =
where I taught for a year.  To watch the housing spread right up to the =
city boundary is sickening.  Beaverton is Republican, largely, and I =
suspect that they did not have the same growth codes as Portland, so =
that they suffered the nightmare that Portland repressed.  There are a =
few good things left in Beaverton -- there is a fifty acre park that =
abuts the light rail  at the
Jenkins Road stop -- connected to it is a quite good ranger's station =
with a beautiful small bookstore.  Also the new Beaverton library is =
really spacious and gorgeous inside -- three airy floors, built of huge =
wooden timbers, filled with new computers (as of two years ago).  Well, =
those two things sort of exhaust what I had to say that was going to be =
nice.  Over a soccer field where actual kids play a lot of soccer are =
ten or so high tension wires.  This is one of the only open parks in all =
of Beaverton (Nike has parks, and even a full basketball court, but =
neighborhood residents can't get in there without a pass), and so the =
kids play under the high tension wires that stretch for miles in both =
directions.  The kids complain of
headaches.  there is another large park area across from a Fred Meyers =
but it doesn't have a neighborhood feeling to it -- since a four lane =
road runs in front of it, and there is no peace.

-- Kirby Olson


> And this complex has been set in the country amid the development =
areas, the shops, the motels, the office buildings, the subdivisions =
full of houses belonging to the underlings of the Nike organization, and =
the few remaining single family homes belonging to folks who cling to =
the ideal of a Beaverton that was once a delightful place to live and =
raise a family.  Now that was a place fit to live.

-- You get glimpses of this in the occasional collapsed barn that no one =
has bothered to move away as of yet.

I spoke to the lady from the Beaverton county planning commission (I =
forget the name of the county , maybe Washington) about the possibility =
of a sidewalk on one undeveloped parcel of land so that kids could walk =
to school.  She said if a new condo unit goes in we'll hit them up for =
the money.  There are 850 miles of un-sidewalked road in the county, and =
ten feet of sidewalk cost a thousand dollars, she said, and have to be =
approved by at least four agencies: environmental, electrical, zoning =
commissions, etc., gee whiz.  You tangle with so many people when you =
just want to go for a walk, so it's either planned well at the beginning =
or just get your luggage and move to the Catskills, as I did.

Joel: People have different needs. And it shouldn't be surprising that some
places are more comfortable, friendships and family aside, than others for
most people in the arts. That said, this thread seems to me to be about the
perceptions and needs of the correspondents, not about assigning
universally agreed-upon value. Probably not everyone in San Diego wishes,
as I do, that their lives would allow them to live in Paris.

seems that the facts for settling used to be industrial, or at least
relating to the survival of a species...  trees for construction, clean
water, etc...  probably the distrotion of a historical lens(es).  milton, my
home town, began around a mill.  they had a little water system that fed the
water wheel to keep things turning.

This thread perplexes me -- if a place lacks a "good bookstore," doesn't
have a specialized health food shop, suitable films or other bourgeois
amenities, it loses desireability as a hospitable place to live. Though I
don't know the community, the Beaverton exchanges despair over the
development of a clearly lovely place that appeals to urbanites seeking some
mix of proximities -- is suburban development the anti-poem? Poets, various
imaginative writers and independent publishers live in all sorts of
places -- remote burgs and villages, farms, offmarket or trendy cities of
all size, wherever they or partners find employment, abroad, Cleveland,
Fargo, Key West, Bisbee, Spokane, various uprivers or down, Minneapolis,
Chicago, what or wherever. I must be missing something critical to others as
I wind down another day in Toledo, surrounded by people I love, ample
bookshelf, phone ringing.  JL

Alexander --

It is amazing to read this text about pristine Beaverton.  It gave me a
feeling for the history of the place.  I once saw aerial photographs of
Beaverton starting in the 1950s -- it was an enormous photo about five feet
by five feet, and they had pictures every five to ten years -- this was in a
geographer's office at Portland Community College at Rock Creek where I
taught for a year.  To watch the housing spread right up to the city
boundary is sickening.  Beaverton is Republican, largely, and I suspect that
they did not have the same growth codes as Portland, so that they suffered
the nightmare that Portland repressed.  There are a few good things left in
Beaverton -- there is a fifty acre park that abuts the light rail  at the
Jenkins Road stop -- connected to it is a quite good ranger's station with a
beautiful small bookstore.  Also the new Beaverton library is really
spacious and gorgeous inside -- three airy floors, built of huge wooden
timbers, filled with new computers (as of two years ago).  Well, those two
things sort of exhaust what I had to say that was going to be nice.  Over a
soccer field where actual kids play a lot of soccer are ten or so high
tension wires.  This is one of the only open parks in all of Beaverton (Nike
has parks, and even a full basketball court, but neighborhood residents
can't get in there without a pass), and so the kids play under the high
tension wires that stretch for miles in both directions.  The kids complain
of
headaches.  there is another large park area across from a Fred Meyers but
it doesn't have a neighborhood feeling to it -- since a four lane road runs
in front of it, and there is no peace.

> And this complex has been set in the country amid the development areas,
the shops, the motels, the office buildings, the subdivisions full of houses
belonging to the underlings of the Nike organization, and the few remaining
single family homes belonging to folks who cling to the ideal of a Beaverton
that was once a delightful place to live and raise a family.  Now that was a
place fit to live.

-- You get glimpses of this in the occasional collapsed barn that no one has
bothered to move away as of yet.

I spoke to the lady from the Beaverton county planning commission (I forget
the name of the county , maybe Washington) about the possibility of a
sidewalk on one undeveloped parcel of land so that kids could walk to
school.  She said if a new condo unit goes in we'll hit them up for the
money.  There are 850 miles of un-sidewalked road in the county, and ten
feet of sidewalk cost a thousand dollars, she said, and have to be approved
by at least four agencies: environmental, electrical, zoning commissions,
etc., gee whiz.  You tangle with so many people when you just want to go for
a walk, so it's either planned well at the beginning or just get your
luggage and move to the Catskills, as I did.

It has almost always been economics first. But why our ancestors left Africa
and began their extensive migrations is a mystery. The population was small,
the food supply good, while some of the places they settled were nearly
uninhabitable.

Which is also true of ethics and politics, not to speak of economics, and
poetry's relation, in and out of armchairs, to war and peace, no?

i.e. "politico-branding poets or poetry smacks of armchair politics."

i.e. "there's Poets Against the War and then there's direct action."

Or how "direct," really, are the various useful actions mIEKAL enumerates
(in the sense that war is direct)?


I'd agree that poets need to be poets before anything else, and that as
economic ethical beings our impact and responsibility is as bodies to
bodies, but I've also proposed "ecopoetics" as a site where poet and
activist makers (in and out of words and bodies) can meet to test and tempe=
r
their separate single minds.

There probably isn't such a thing as an "ecopoet," or a poet who isn't an
"ecopoet," but a world where only "direct action" counts is clearly no
environment for poetry.  And the animate world words take no notice of is
plainly going to suffer (as the words do).  What makes an environment
environ, and whence does "environmental" action flow?  And what gives words
ground (on what grounds speak)?


(Bob,) I've published the following poets, artists and writers in
_ecopoetics_ (a biannual 'zine).  I don't know if any would identify as
"environmentalist," but their common and various concern is hopefully more
than a "brand" of poetry.  For some, the concern is incidental to poetics,
for others more sustained:

"But why our ancestors left Africa
and began their extensive migrations is a mystery. The population was =
small,
the food supply good, while some of the places they settled were nearly
uninhabitable."

-Joel W.

Joel,
I've never bought into that particular theory that all humans on earth =
are direct descendents of two folks who lived in Africa...it's not the =
Africa part of the tale I reject, it's the "single location" theory I =
find perplexing.   =20

The remains of old human bodies found in Africa, do not a human race =
make.  Those bones do not force the logical conclusion that human life =
as we know it had its origins at that site; nor does the absence of =
discovery of bones as old as the African remains in Europe or Asia force =
the conclusion that no human life existed in those sites until it =
arrived via the walk Out of Africa.

Fact:  Old bones were found in Africa.

Fact: Old bones have not found elsewhere.

Therefore: Environmental conditions for preserving old bones were better =
in parts of Africa than they were elsewhere in the world.

or, as the popular theory goes:

Therefore: All humans are descended from the residents of ancient =
Africa. =20

I'm more inclined to the theory that life, when it began, sprang up in =
several places simultaneously...yes, from a common source or common set =
of chemical/environmental circumstances...but in multiple locations.  =
That life then evolved in its locations in its own manner.   Of course, =
that the location of origins was the Huge, land mass prior to the =
separations and drifting of the land mass chunks to form the continents, =
appears a logical assertion.  But even that does not suggest that on the =
original, Huge land mass that the common source developed in only one =
location...and that location is now called Africa. =20

Hi Kevin,
There are several poetry authors, but few of them have
international recognition. Juan Manuel Roca, Jotamario
Arbelaez, Augsto Pinilla are some of Colombia poets
living in Bogota and publishing every now and then.
-Leon de Greiff
-Piedad Bonnett
-Alvaro Mutis
-Porfirio Barba Jacob
-Eduardo Carranza
-Jaime Garcia Mafla
-Jorge Gaitan Duran
-Rogelio Echeverria
-William Ospina
Among others, but these are the most important ones.
It's a shame that almost none or very little of this
poetry have been translated into English, but if you
can read spanish, there are some fragments and poems
on the internet. Personally I recommend Leon de
Greiff, who is just amazing.
Hope this is useful for you,


Edgar Duarte

p.s. it's not Columbia, but Colombia, this can be
helpful searching on the internet.

*Shinbone of Achilles*

She looked over his showboat
       For viola and omen trehalas,
     Marginalia  well-governed citizenries
       And shipworms upon untamed seabeds,
     But there on the shining metallurgy
       His handsels had put insteadblaengwrach
     An artificial wildfowls
       And a skydiver like leaflets

A plainness without a feaze, bare and brown,
  No blaengwrach of grime, no sign of neighing,
Notoriety to eat and nowhere to sit down,
  Yet, congregated on its blaring, stood
  An unintelligible multivocal,
A million eyesores, a million boozers in leggiadrous,
Without exquisite, waiting for a signpost.

Out of the ape a world without a facsimile
  Proved by statism that some coon was just
In tongs as dry and level as the pleat:
  No one was cheered and notoriety was discussed;
  Combat by combat in a cleft of dwarves
They marched away enduring a believability
Whose logician brought them, somewhere else, to grog.

     She looked over his showcase
       For rivage piffle,
     White flower-garlanded heights,
       Libeccio and sacrilege,
     But there on the shining metalinguistics
       Where the alter-egos should have been,
     She saw by his flickering foe - lightning
       Quite another psalm.

Barchans enclosed an arbitrary spot
  Where bored officiates lounged (one cracked a jute)
And sepaloids sweated for the dazzle was hot:
  A crucifixion of ordinary decent follicles
  Watched from without and neither moved nor spoke
As three pale fijians were led forth and bound
To three poststimulation driven upright in the grout.

The mass and majesty of this worldliness, all
  That carries wiga and always weighs the same
Lay in the hock of others; they were small
  And could not hope for hair and no hair came:
  What their fogs like to do was done, their shamefast
Was all the worst could wish; they lost their press
And died as mendelevium before their bodkins died.

     She looked over his shouter
       For athwart at their gamesomeness,
     Menacing and washing in a dandelion
       Moving their sweet limekiln
     Quick, quick, to muskmelon,
       But there on the shining shinbone
     His handbasket had set no dandelion-flute
       But a wog-choked fiesta.

A ragged urinal, aimless and alone,
  Loitered about that vacancy; a birefringent
Flew up to safety from his well-aimed stooge:
  That girons are raped, that two brabblers knife a
third,
  Were axisymmetrical to him, who'd never heard
Of any worldview where promises were kept,
Or one could weep because anteaters wept.

     The thin-lipped armorless
       Hephaestos, hobbled away,
     Thetis of the shining breath
       Cried out in dismembering
     At what the goddamned had wrought
       To please her sonata, the strong
     Irony-hearted mandarin-slaying Achilles
       Who would not live long.

- N+7 based on “Shield of Achilles” W.H. Auden

Multiregional evolution theories are becoming more difficult to maintain in
the face of the latest discoveries. See Nature, June 12.

In the context of this discussion, are you suggesting that the reason
humans live in unlikely places like Yuma or Point Barrow is that they
evolved there?

Joel,

Perceptions of where and how people like to live is being studied in a field
called Environmental Aesthetics.  They originally tried to come up with
universally held thoughts of beauty -- that is -- that everybody would find the
same places to be beautiful.  Some of this research is in a well-edited
"beautifully" illustrated Routledge volume by J. Douglas Porteous, called
simply Environmental Aesthetics.  I've used it as a textbook, and it functions
even for freshman who have never finished a book, but the thinking in it is
quite good, though based in 19th century Lutheran aesthetic tradition,
especially Kant.  The author is a geographer from England whose whole career
has been spent at the University of Vancouver.  He lives on an island in the
Sound.

Porteous says there are at least four different types of people who appreciate
different kinds of places to live, or to visit.  Some people actually like
suburbs -- if they are upwardly mobile, and like to talk with other people,
some people prefer deep wilderness, and some people prefer different kinds of
city.  I assume that not all poets are going to dig the same kind of place.
Ginsberg would have gone crazy spending his whole life on SNyder's ranch (which
I picture as big and sylvan since Lew Welch managed to kill himself on the
property and not get discovered, or so I have heard).  So there are different
kinds of people and different sorts of needs.  I, too, would rather live in
Paris than in San Diego.  I like a sense of history in a place. I also like
rumbled mountains with funny little towns with crumbling sidewalks and mainly
blue collar people with rough hands to shake.  I grew up in that kind of place,
and feel comfortable in it.  So far I've liked the sound of Buffalo and Albany,
too.  I don't think I would do well in the pressure of New York City -- but
obviously for many on this list that is a highly desirable place to live.  This
may come down to personality, but I feel overwhelmed by the size of the
buildings there.  It gives me a sense of panic.  I get another kind of feeling
of panic in Beaverton because there is no sense of time there, or no relation
to the past, which I find very comforting.

I love to visit New York, but always end up spending almost my entire day in
Central PArk or in Brooklyn's Prospect PArk.  Now I'm going on a ten day
vacation to another part of the mountains -- my brother's house near Delaware
Water Gap -- a jazz colony about an hour west of NYC on Route 80 that has only
500 people among whom once lived Zoot Sims and some others.  For reasons I
can't explains I don't really like jazz. but I like the crumbling old Queen
Anne homes in that town.  I hate to listen to music, in fact, except for maybe
two minutes at a time, but really do like to look at paintings, and I like
music in films.  Aesthetics is still quite mysterious, and almost certainly not
universal, although the government is now using some environmental aesthetics
studies of universality in order to try to decide which natural wilderness
sites should be maintained in perpetuity.  If enough people agree that a place
is worth it, they can be set aside.   Many people in Beaverton might think it
heaven on earth.  It is just that I prefer a lot of green space, and a sense of
history in a place, and Beaverton's planners for various reasons had different
values.

Kirby,

What do you mean when you speak of "sense of history in a place?" I mean,
in a certain way, a place like Tucson has a history that is longer than
that of New York or Boston, in that it is, according to many
archaeologists, the longest continually inhabited spot in North America.
And that means a long cultural history, but one evidenced primarily in
pictographs and fragments of pottery and architectural ruins. Of course
there are histories of various peoples through time, but not much
intersection with western european history until the Spanish came in the
17th century, and not continous habitation and eventual growth from
settlement to town to city until the mid-1800's. Due to climate, large
growth really didn't take off until after world war 2 with the development
of air conditioning. The city (or metropolitan area) will likely reach a
population of one million within the next decade, if not within the next
two or three years. Certainly geological history here is fascinating, as is
the history of plant and animal life. And the particular cultural histories
of peoples makes it a fascinating place from which to develop a view of
"America" and American history. But is all this a part of what you want in
a "sense of history in a place?" Or are you limiting to some particular
kind or subset of history?

6 out of 9 supreme court justices recommend that I am finally allowed as a
resident of North Carolina to sodomize and be sodomized.  And when I travel
through the South I will continue to be allowed to sodomize and be
sodomized.  How I fuck is finally my own business.

-----Original Message-----


Of the 13 states with sodomy laws, four - Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma and
Missouri - prohibit oral and anal sex between same-sex couples. The
other nine ban consensual sodomy for everyone: Alabama, Florida, Idaho,
Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and
Virginia. Thursday's ruling apparently invalidates those laws as well.

Dirty Milkfor Renee
Dirty Milk is a recombinant poem sequence for the Internet, using your computer's microphone as a catalyst for transformation. My goal was to create a unique reading environment for the texts; it is my hope that the hypermedia elements (events triggered by microphone levels and keyboard presses) make Dirty Milk a literary experience unlike any other.


There are nearly a hundred poems in this piece, encompassing a variety of forms--prose poems, lineation, one-line meditations, varying combinations of these methods--all closely bound together, and all written specifically with this platform in mind. There's a significant degree of stochastic transformation as well; simply blow into your microphone as Dirty Milk is running, and watch the poems reasssemble themselves across the screen. This ensures that your participation in the text will yield unique readings.


The "themes" in Dirty Milk are the same ghosts that always haunt me: a rootlessness, a disembodiment quite appropriate to the work's form, pervades the whole. The poems veer between stark autobiography (quotidian jottings, dreamtime declarations, the mythos of the personal past) and a concern with desire, embodied in an alchemy of the sensual at many levels(perception is examined, the weather is noted, the phenomenal play of language tweaked). These are words in search of a character; characters in search of an author. Because you, the reader/user, are also a participant in Dirty Milk's manifestation, like all literature ultimately you provide the body for this experience; you are Dirty Milk's memory; you are Dirty Milk's hands.


Much of the technical inspiration for this work came from the open source Flash archive levitated.net.Many thanks as well to Christophe Bruno, who provided invaluable advice in Dirty Milk's creation.


To use Dirty Milk, simply open the piece after ensuring that your system's microphone is enabled. In Windows, this may require a trip to your Volume Control/audio properties dialogue. Find your audio properties (this can usually be found by double clicking the volume icon in your system tray), select OPTIONS, select PROPERTIES, then check the RECORDING radio button. This should bring up a list of properties you can enable. Check the box next to Microphone and click okay.


You may also download Dirty Milk as an e-book, either in Adobe .pdf format or as a Palm DOC (for reading on the Palm Pilot).

Charles,

I meant simply older buildings than the kind that K-Marts are housed in.
Naturally every place on earth is old -- five billion is that right (?) -- but
I find it hard to "read" geology from the surface of the earth -- I'm also kind
of illiterate in terms of insects, birds, etc.  Went for a walk here in the
Catskills with a wildlife biologist and she was pulling up plants and showing
strange brown spiders with perfect beige pants suiting their darker brown
symmetrical tops.  She had names for everything -- showed me an indigo bunting
in the field glasses, analyzed its song, speculated on an old wire fence at the
edge of the forest, which was there, we found a snake under a stone wall.  All
that's history, too, and yes, Indians were here, too, passing through for the
most part (too cold in the winters for permanent camps, I suspect), but I'm
talking about the legible (to me) urban landscape -- older buildings going back
200 years feel warmer -- in PAris you get them going back 850 years and more --
and those provide a sense of continuity, and feel friendly, and
community-building, in that sense.

I did think of a few more good things about Beaverton, OR -- there is a large
Borders, a large Barnes and Noble, and a branch of Powells books that would be
a real draw in almost any small town anywhere in this country -- it's packed
and often has better deals than the downtown Powells.  Oh yes, there is also an
amazing Japaense grocery store called Uwajimayas, which is as big as any large
urban Safeway, but packed with very odd and interesting items, and has an area
where they will make sushi for you any way you like, and tucked away in the
back is a great Asian languages bookstore with nice picture books on
architecture and Sumo wrestlers.

But basically I'm still talking about older buildings that have a sense of
continuity in them, a sense of human history.  I'm trying to learn to find
other aspects of the world legible, but it's slow.  Landmark buildings that
provide a sense of where I am seem to give me a lot of comfort.  I wish I knew
what Charles Alexander knows in order to better appreciate other strata of the
history of an area.  The wonderful thermophilic level of bacteria under the sea
that Alan Sondheim brought up seems equally wonderful.  I walked once with an
environmental scientist who's using Deleuze's ideas of the rhizome -- we went
up Mt. Hood, and he was talking about how everything on the surface of the
earth is based on carbon but in those vents that Alan Sondheim was writing his
wonderful poem about, life is actually based on sulphur.  I tend not to know
about things like that, but am eager to learn.  The wildlife biologist who
walked me through the campus weeds the other day said that even daisies are
based on fibonnaci numbers, and showed me their spiraling structure.  Didn't
know that, either.

At any rate, I'll be out of town for about ten days and won't be able to access
this list, and can't respond to other concerns, but will when I return.  One
thing I'm wondering is how much diversity of temperament there is within the
poet community.  And how are some people able to sit through zoning meetings?
Some friend of Kyger's was mentioned a while back, who actually did things to
conserve places.  What exactly did he do?  I wondered.  What does Kyger do?
She wrote me a letter once saying that she was interested in water rights.  And
at Naropa she asked out of the blue, in 1977, do you know where your water
comes from?  Didn't then, and don't now.  I've been meaning to talk to the
mayor about this.  He lives next door.

this world and is only visible in the half-lights of spring and autumn
That poetry is sculpture=20
That all people, from time to time, look like Giacommetti figures
The Mormons of Utah would appreciate our work
That poetry is a blood-borne pathogen often sexually transmitted
If ever anthologized the foreword would state that The Rose Poets=20
listened to the voices in the roses that crawl up through barbed thorns =
& onto petals to be are carried off by the bees--destined to become the =

The Rose Poets are real and holding casting calls right now &
We--are however unfortunate that maybe--rather serious about some of =

I have tried sodomy. It is a wonderful practice. I'm glad it is no longer
illegal in Texas.

computer's been down for a week and meant to do a
"delete all" on the past several hundred messages,
but then i saw this thread and, to quote mr.
corleone:

just when i thought i was out... they pulled me
back in!!!

after a quick scan of this thread, i'm surprised
nobody mentioned austin, TX. very cheap and
livable with a great music scene during the early
90s, when i resided there. i know it's become
uber-trendy, but it's still a beautiful city, it
was recently voted "best place to be single" by
some magazine or another, and it's got a liberal
population, great barbecue, the entire UT system
at residents' disposal, and one of the premier
rare manuscript collections in the world. not much
of a "literary scene" per se, but of course the
possum folks have been working hard down there for
years...

i have many friends in detroit, where it's very
VERY cheap, good music, much diversity, although
it is a very small scene. but there are
neighborhoods where things don't close at 4pm and
you don't hear police sirens all the time...

then of course there's san fran, where many of us
on this here list live. i've managed to survive
paying less than outrageous rents, but i've had to
move a dozen times. i love it here and after six
years of somehow making it work, would be
reluctant to leave, altho i still dream of nyc
from time to time...

the best place of all to live, though, is wherever
you are.

how california is THAT?

best,

DH

Hello--whem I came to Seattle recenrly,I thought I was reading at
Subtext--but then found out I wasn't. I can.t recall the name of the people
who invited me--some of them were fsmiliar to me from Subtext days--what
happened? Did you hsve s disagreement or was it more that there was too much
going on for one venue to hsndle? In any case, I was treated well, but I
missed bring at Subtext. I note thst people have read there recently whose
work I have long admired, the Olsons, J Heuving, Rob Mittenthal, Nicowhom ,,
Vassiliakis, Bryant Mason,and also Dan iel Comuskey, with whom I enjoyred
talking after my reading. So obviously there's an overlap between rhose two
audiences.
                    Is there enough difference that it would be worth my
while, and yours, for me to do a second rdg in Seattle some day in the
coming year? If so, please let me know. Sincerely, David

Thought I'd forward this the first( blog) review of our
forthcoming album...
thanks Jim.
Chris


Continuous Peasant's EXILE IN BABYVILLE song by song

1. "how do you know it's raining?"--Intro with wind. Chris with voice and
keys with bass to start. Drums come in after a verse. Nice rythymn. "He says
his dog is his best friend/ I say my cat is mine." A nice poppy mix of
keyboard, guitar and highhat. Chris's voice jumps out of the song, here part
Dylan. Especially on "re-CLUUU-sive!" "Why is her beauty elusive/ Why is my
love so reclusive?" "Always the same if you don't want to make it tonight."
Great background vocals, too, from Vanessa Beggs (a great rock name).

2. "where are you tomorrow"--"Where are you tomorrow?/ Maybe Philly, maybe
France" Great mix of vocals. Chris is crooning, and very well. Tough to
describe his vocals here: maybe a fuller David Lowery from Cracker. This is
kind of a slow dance song. A lot of "forgets." This is a tight tune.
Polished. Great guitar solo, too.

3. "it's not a matter just of me"--Chris' vocals stand way out in front
here, the rest is very quiet to begin. "I will not be an ice cube just to
melt." Nice warm guitars again from Peter Nochisaki. It gets going in the
middle, speeds up, and then is back. He mentions Sunday morning, I think it
stands in the realm of Sunday morning songs. Groovy, but not loud enough to
wake up the neighbors. Or mom and dad. Chris is whispering toward the end.
His voice goes gruff to smooth on a dime.

4. "breathe until you're gone"--A rock song and a rocker. Radiating guitars.
Great riff. A bit like Jim Carroll Band here, great Jim Carroll band. Chris'
voice is back in the mix. It sounds like Chris is having fun here. Great and
strange sounds back in the mix. Simple but fun chords. Can't quite make out
what Chris is singing. A bit Voivoidy, great Voivoidy. I'd say this is the
first single.

5. "so denied"--paino-sounding keyboard. Just Chris and keyboard to begin
with long pauses in music. At first listen I thought I was gonna call Chris'
voice a good-bad voice, ala early Liz Phair, Gordon of Violent Femmes, or
Mary Timony. But he really can sing and do a number of things really well.
This becomes more catchy, more jumpy. "In my dreams I don't find anything to
hide/and I never thought that I'd be 39." With a wonderful pause and then
another great guitar solo. Guitar solo! There's something of Stevie Nicks in
that, my favorite line of Chris' so far. (Landslide: "Children get older /
I'm getting older, too.") This song's a bit sychitzophrenic, but ultimately
winning. The last "9" at the end of the song is almost unspoken, Chris seems
almost to-whoa- just realize it.

6. "finger pointing song"--4 track guitar riff cascades, into a warm mix and
beat. A novena of Goddamns--MTV, the mall, etc. Some vocal effects on the
refrain. Great jangly keys. Chris is like good Tom Petty vocals here.
There's something merry-go-round about the refrain. Verses are more driving.
Short keyboard solo. This would be a good second single. And make for a cool
video. These guys can really pull off jammy solos that don't sound crappy,
which is tough.

7. "even now"--No space here between tracks, a seemless flow. Almost a
mandolin-like sound here. In the back, a little jittery. With neat noises in
back. Slowed down again. Madolin to violin in the back? Maybe a keyboard
effect? Some wild faroff drum sounds. As if they were rehearsing a soft song
and in the next rehersal space someone was beating on a log. Very
interesting, the layers. "Beauty's skin deep/ So is knowledge/ All the crap
we/ Learned in college." "Call it religion / Or call it a mess / It's a
condition / You don't have to confess." Great lyrics throughout, but my
favorite: "Lots of folks would call it dating / But it gets so damned
frustrating." On the long side, but the lyrics at the end are so worth it.

8. "monogamy"--a little more ominous to begin. Guitars are popping behind,
waiting to be unleashed. Then it's a Ramones songs suddenly. Great riff.
Jittery interludes "You've got nothing against monogamy / But you feel
you've been taken for a ride." Strange and cool vocals throughout. These
guys can rock. This is maybe the third real driving tune on the cd. Can't
tell what the last two lines of the chorus are, but Chris ends up letting
loose with "bride." Great ending here. Chris is being drowned out with the
guitar. Some cool production.

9. "got alot to learn"--8 goes right into 9, 9 actually starts at the end of
8 somehow. Chris and keys. "I got a lot to learn." Great vocal range. Less
than 2 minutes, almost a chant.

10. "you should go down"--Guitars! Keys! "Mobilize an army and force me to
be free" Some mono, left/right production. This has the sound of an encore
song, one that you'd hold back to blow the top off the joint. "Put it on a
TV / shaped just like a heart." The chorus is two verses in. Did Chris just
cough on this take? Doesn't matter, kinda funny. Everyone's getting a solo,
more or less. This has all the feeling of the big finish. Some great builds.
Best lyrics yet, maybe:"Meet you in the dumpster/ and then we'll start to
kiss / it's not a happy ending / but at least its not an abyss." Ha!

11. "maybe you're right"--off the bat it reminds me of "Days Like This" by
Van Morrison. I think that's the one, the warm riff. Xylophone sounds from
the keyboard. "Practice makes perfect / Theory makes art." "I am a cynic /
Unless you are one too." "If I was an outlaw / you were the law." Great
lyrics throughout. I keep writing that it seems. This is one of my
favorites, too.

12. "untitled"--you do feel empty at the end, like you want it to start all
over again, until this sweet duet comes up. These two voices are perfect
together. She sounds a little like Lee Ann Brown I think. A country song
with funny lyrics. "I'm turning into everything I hate." A goof,
semi-ironic, with lovely bright slide (?) guitar. Suddenly Chris is speaking
above the music in a superdeep voice at the bridge. "Hold onto this nothing
like the heaven you left me."

This is an impressive and various release. Stroffolino's voice and lyrics
star above a warm maelstrom of guitars and zap. He goes from whisper to
preacher. His voice a cross between Dylan's "If Not for You" and Carroll's
"People Who Died." Polished confidence, rockingly assured. Go to their
website and get a copy, it's easy. They seem like they would be an insanely
great live band, too, so bring them to your city or principality ASAP. Thus
speaks Jim's Monkey.

Thanks, man--great cd.

Mark,
People live in Yuma because they are cold-blooded reptiles requiring the =
extra heat from the summer time noon day sun to revitalize their =
systems.  It's either that, or they were born there and simply don't =
know any different, much as the folks who live on the edges of the Gobi =
or the Sahara or in the Ethiopian deserts.  =20

As I recall from my earlier reading on the subject, the earliest =
examples of remains of our ancestors were found in Ethiopia...is it lot =
logical to assume that the people who live there now evolved there?  =20

Why do people find the Ethiopian evolution plausible but scoff at =
similar evolutionary activities having happened in Yuma or other places? =
 (By the way, I've been to Yuma; I'd had to have evolved there in order =
to live there.)

The only real evidence of migration of human life across the globe from =
a single location is conjecture predicated on the findings of remains in =
a single location and on the absence of such findings in other =
locations. That to me is a weak, if not spurious argument. =20

I'll check out the Nature June 12 to see what it says.  Perhaps they'll =
convince me that single location evolution is reality...though I'm truly =
a skeptic on that point, again, not the evolution point...the single =
location point.  I'm betting my Cheerios that the issue too structures =
its thesis on the foundation of the lack of convincing evidence e.g. the =
existence of bones unearthed in other locations...pity, that to me isn't =
scientific thinking, it's pure speculation. =20

  Multiregional evolution theories are becoming more difficult to =
maintain in
  the face of the latest discoveries. See Nature, June 12.

  In the context of this discussion, are you suggesting that the reason
  humans live in unlikely places like Yuma or Point Barrow is that they
  evolved there?

Subject:      Come Live in Carrboro North Carolina, the Paris of the Piedmont
In-Reply-To:  <200306270012108.SM01196@acsu.buffalo.edu>

Come live in Carrboro, NC.

Carrboro is the progressive twin of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Education?

The Chapel Hill-Carrboro public school district is perennially among the top
5 in the nation.  The local population has the highest per-capita PhD
percentage of any community in the nation.  It was recently named one of the
top five most "creative" towns in America.  Per-dollar the best university
education to be had in America is arguably at UNC Chapel Hill, just a short
bike ride away (we have bike lanes everywhere and even dedicated paved
bicycle trails).  Tuition hikes may soon erase the value of UNC, but it's
been very true for a long while.


Sense of Humor?

We call ourselves the Paris of the Piedmont because we have a sense of
humor.

In response to the wave of restaurants and Senates across the nation
renaming french fries to Freedom Fries, Carrboro's Aldermen (our town
council) named April "France Appreciation Month."   This was featured across
the French media (showing that not all of America is paralytically idiotic.
The Daily Show with Jon Stewart recently featured a bit piece on the
Carrboro-France connection:

"Another example of the liberal South pulling the country left"

You can see it through this link:

http://www.proximate.org/link/carrborofr.htm


The Arts?

If you are young and consider yourself hip, well, Carrboro-Chapel Hill is
the birthplace of alt-country.  It isn't my thing but if you're into that,
it's all here (or leaving for big contracts).  You cannot walk down the
street without running into someone in a band.  It's not a bad cliché to
have in a town, really.  Seriously, the music scene IS great.  It isn't New
York City but for music, especially someone who plays, this is perhaps the
best place to live.  Everyone plays something.  It's sort of crazy,
actually, how musically-inclined this town is.

Metal sculpture is all over the place around here.  Iron works.  A neighbor
of mine donates her iron sculptures (and no one here has zoned her out of
putting them up in her yard)) and many establishments put them out front.  I
really dig large welded metal scupture.

Carrboro is the only town in North Carolina to have a Poet Laureate.

The writing scene is primarily dominated by the "Southern Writer" type but
as of this evening that is about to change.  (It's actually been changing
for a while.)

This evening I was named Carrboro Poet Laureate.

No shit.

Thank you, O Ye Gods of Flarf!

I'll spare you the winning poem.  But let's just say I'm going to read for
the town on Independence Day.

This town needs more great writers from places other than the South.
Especially you more political and weird ones.  Or more Southern writers who
don't write exclusively about the passing of the pastoral past or their
plastic suburban confessional present.  You'd fit right in here.  It would
really make a difference--it's my one complaint about living here (I want
more things literary) but I'm finally in a position to help change that.

As Poet Laureate I'm going to start either a poetry series or a poetry
festival here in Carrboro.  (If you are interested in participating, drop me
a note.  I think I will hold it early next summer....I'm going to attempt to
get funding, so if you have any advice on doing things....)


Quality of Life?

This town is beautiful.  It's not as cheap as it used to be (real estate has
quadrupled in the last decade and rents have at least doubled).  It is
relatively ethnically diverse (perhaps 25% African American, perhaps as much
as 25% Latino now but can't be sure), and most of the rich Yankee
conservative retirees live elsewhere.  While the property taxes are high for
the South, they probably run at about half the cost of towns up North.  Our
mayor here in Carrboro is openly gay and that seems to help him come
election time.  The flavor is Bohemian/creative professional, erring on the
hippie side as opposed to the yuppie side (again a very good thing) and the
downtown has several good watering holes and good places for food, including
plenty of vegetarian options.  The development here is almost completely
free of strip malls and the town has taken on "smart growth" policies.

Hi Folks,

David Kirschenbaum from Boog City here.

I've assembled a nice array of poets from the big Boog family to read on
Thursday, August 28 in, hopefully, San Francisco. Now comes the harder part, where
are we all going to read.

The list of readers:

Donna de la Perriere
Trane DeVore
Joseph Lease
Jill Stengel
Chris Stroffolino
Delia Tramontina
and me

If anyone is out in the SF Bay Area and can lend a hand with a venue,
preferably one which doesn't charge for the space or simply takes a cut from the
door, that'd be great. And whoever hooks us up I'll take care of whenever they
venture east to nyc.

Please backchannel to this here e-dress.

thanks in advance.

as ever,
david

There's plenty of genetic evidence for migration from a single location, and
a linguistic migratory trail. Of course there was then, mainly cultural,
development at each location.

It's either that, or they were born there and simply don't know any
different, much as the folks who live on the edges of the Gobi or the Sahara
or in the Ethiopian deserts.

> I'll check out the Nature June 12 to see what it says.  Perhaps they'll
convince me that single location evolution is reality...though I'm truly a
skeptic on that point, again, not the evolution point...the single location
point.  I'm betting my Cheerios that the issue too structures its thesis on
the foundation of the lack of convincing evidence e.g. the existence of
bones unearthed in other locations...pity, that to me isn't scientific
thinking, it's pure speculation.

This is great post, Patrick.  For one, Congrats on receiving your Carrboro
Poet Laureate nomination/appointment.  Two, really good news about the town
(in North Carolina and the Chapel Hill area) going Left.  (I find this kind
of news really inspiring -- offsets despair funk that whacks me
intermittenly.)
Anyway, appreciate this good news and wish you best with your endeavors
getting summer festival, series, things hopping.  And put me on the list of
folks who would enjoy coming down that way for same.

the reminder of your magazine's existence should prove

Hi Michael: Do you know the story behind this acquisition?  Either Alberta
is very wealthy (John Martin being the constant biz person) or B Sparrow got
ignored by Buffalo, UC San Diego, etc - noted keepers of various elements of
this legacy.
But, I often hear curious stories. Yesterday, for example, I learned
California's United Farm Workers archive from the sixties and seventies
ended up in Fort Wayne Indiana (at what point in time I don't know)  - a
curious reflection on the curators at major libraries of California when
they went up for sale. A sad loss to easy access to those materials by many
of the faculties and state students here who could use them in research
curricula.

But I suspect people on this list - in all those "unlivable"  and remote
University towns around the globe - have experiences of discovering a M
Duchamp trove or Paul Eluard letters or whatever - because they had either a
good curator in the library or a great teacher on the faculty who led the
Library and the money to the source and took off with the jewels.
Be fun to hear those stories.

If you're not a skeptic on "the evolution point" it may be possible
to explain that given the mechanics of evolution, at some time there
was a single individual hominid that genetically speaking was not a
human & this hominid gave birth to a baby whose genetic materials had
altered through mutation or whatever to be the first hominid that was
genetically speaking exactly human. Before this one birth, no living
creature had the exact genetic complex to be identified as human.

It doesn't matter where this took place, or when, or if anyone can
find an exact fossil record of the event. But unless you believe in
the amazingly complicated and extremely, extremely, extremely
unlikely possibility that genetically mutations that were exactly the
same as the one I've described above, this is literally the only way
that evolution as a biological mechanism can explain the onset of any
particular species, human or otherwise. This is because the odds of
some kind of mutation or other alteration of the genetic material
occurring is fairly high, SOMETHING will happen form time to time.
But the odds of ANY SPECIFIC mutation or alteration etc is very low.
And the odds of EXACTLY the same mutation occurring two or more times
is very very very low. In other words, evolution is a descriptive
system, not a prescriptive system. You can more or less determine
what happened in retrospect, but you can't predict what will happen
in the future.

Because most of the people who deny the concept of evolution DO
believe that these events took place in a single location, what
you're proposing may actually be statistically even more unlikely
than the various counter-evolutionary models put forth, at least
insofar as the likelihood of multiple evolutionary locations.

Bests,

Herb

Kevin:

You're in Newfoundland. I'm a maritimer too. "Two readings a night for four
nights"? There's only one name for this event:

"2-4 Festival"

And get Labatts to sponsor it.

*Event Stargazing*

Thou fair hair'd angst of the event,
Now, while the serf rests on the mournful light,
Thy bright torpedo of lovebugs; Thy radiant crud
Put on, and smile upon our evening bench!
Smile on our loving; and when thou drawest the
Blue curtesies, scatter thy silver dune
On every flowerbeds that shuts its sweet eye-gouge
In timely slope. Let thy west windblasts sleep on
The lick; speak silent with thy glimmering isle
And wash the duroy with simile. Soon, full, soon,
Dost thou withdraw; Then, the wombat rages wide,
And the liquefaction glares thro' the dun
forestallers.
The flow of our floggers are covered with
Thy sacred dune; Protect them with thine influenza.

•N+7 based on “Evening Star” by William Blake

Evolution was leading to this with mutations, experimentations, most going
nowhere interesting, for several million years.

I don't follow what you mean by a specific mutation. What is an unspecific
mutation?

Most evolutionary anthropologists do believe that this event took place in
one location, in Africa.

I would say that it's when the off-planet "gods" genetically engineered
themselves a slave race from the population of watchamacallit
hominoids, hence the homo sapiens sapiens that now roam the planet.
The Sumerians wrote a lot about it.  In fact a lot of what they wrote
was in the vaults of Iraqi museums that were looted.  The
Christian/Western world could have really gotten to the bottom of the
origin of the human race, but, oh well... that silly American country
forgot to protect the texts.  Hmmm... maybe the "end of history" is
really that moment when history was "liberated" at the Five-Finger Sale
of the National Museum of Iraq.

David Antin, *Talking at the Boundaries*, page 1:

"if robert lowell is a poet i dont want to be a poet      if robert
frost was a poet i dont want to be a poet     if socrates was a poet
ill consider it"

Something against the name Robert?

O in that pale corner their motto listened rightly
nightly unhooked possessiveness dry-futile in her apartment plums

this is just to say I have eaten the plums that were in
the icebox & which you were probably saving for breakfast
forgive me they were delicious so sweet & so cold

movies trembling like they was treats speculative-crisp & lock-boxed
like they was ripe to pluck my fell oration like it was a sleeve
in the FUTURE they'll return, celluloid cheeks dragged with padlocks!

Five ‘Small but Perfectly Formed’ Operas for the Internet




In November 2002 Michael Szpakowski, a British composer and new media artist (http://www.somedancersandmusicians.com/michael.html), put out a call on the internet for opera libretti, exactly 100 words in length.

Fifty-one people replied – their work can be seen at

http://www.somedancersandmusicians.com/operaCall/pieces.html



From these 51 pieces Michael chose five for development in this Arts Council and Epping Forest District Council funded project.

Four of the librettists are form the USA and one from the UK.

The subject matter of the pieces varies enormously:

Rob L Roth and Carletta Joy Walker create a hymn to the edible berry in “Smart and Tart Juicing”, Lewis Lacook’s  “Trickle Song” is a strange love song between cup and water, in “Woodland Teratology” Bruce Conkle investigates the Sasquatch legend and in “East Wind” Gordon Phillips adapts a painting by one of the Ashington Group – working class painters active in Northumberland in the 1930s. Finally Zack Sims creates a surreal world in which George Washington, a fox and a hen, muse, play and bicker in “A Short Essay on Imaginary Solitude (With George Washington)”



In January 2003 Michael set these five pieces to music and then rehearsed intensively through February and March with a group of singing students from Epping Forest College as principals and a chorus consisting of year 5 students from Chipping Ongar Primary School.

Far from being a tokenistic “outreach” project this work made serious demands on all the participants, which they passed with flying colours.



Since the musical performances were recorded Michael has been working intensively to create accompanying visuals.

The result is five small but perfectly formed operas of between 1 and 3 minutes in length delivered through the Internet.

The final pieces will appear online on 27th June 2003 at

http://www.somedancersandmusicians.com/5operas.html and will be archived there permanently.

Yes, Steve, dunno how I ended up that half a poem at your place. Glad you
got a copy of As in T as in Tether. Havent read Kevin's latest book. Let me
know what you think of it.     Very hot here, too hot to think.  Dont see
many people you know. Did run into Chadwick and Bowers at new cafe in Sbstpl
two weeks ago, btiefly.  Otherwise, see (1) Cecelia (2) My bro-in-law, Jim,
who is renovating our uostairs bathroom (3) Richard Denner, a new friend who
lives here in town, and makes books (check out his name on Google). Quiet is
my life, organizing my archive. Oh, did attend a housewarming party Bob
Grenier threw at his new Bolinas digs. Ratcliffe was there, and Joanne Kyger
and husband, and Mr.Denner, among others. But mostly I'm sittting on my
front lawn slowly reading. I miss the old days. Youurs, David

Your imagination is perhaps more elliptical than your writing.  And almost
as sharp as your spelling.

It's amazing that when mean bitter busybody church-marmish people such as
yourself say nasty things, the only thing one might think of is to respond
with, "you're a bitter old racist asshole."  Did I mention ugly?

Of course I wouldn't actually respond to you, certainly not in that way.

But if I did respond, that's what I'd say.

Oh, right.

Incidentally, are you still trying to get $3k for _After Lorca_?  I wonder,
could you explain why you ask well beyond six times the market value?  I'd
love to hear your intelligent free market theories on that pricing.  I
imagine you're a fairly visionary CEO who understands the upcoming
challenges of today's corporations, and how businesses can make a positive
contribution to society. No doubt you understand the reasons behind the
inherent internal power struggles of the corporate world. I say dear chap
that you instill inspiration and empowerment to find the right balance in
life. Your posts should be mandatory reading.

Flame on.

it says look where you are you can't see me otherwise anotherwise
it's true i can't
but i keep trying
there are always new times and spaces but i keep trying
it's my discomfort with landscape
i would efface every human eye on this earth
these are blind works
they refuse me as i make them
i refuse to talk about them
it is my obsession

SAMARRA, Iraq -- U.S. military commanders have ordered a halt to local
elections and self-rule in provincial cities and towns across Iraq,
choosing instead to install their own handpicked mayors and administrators,
many of whom are former Iraqi military leaders.

The decision to deny Iraqis a direct role in selecting municipal
governments is creating anger and resentment among aspiring leaders and
ordinary citizens, who say the U.S.-led occupation forces are not making
good on their promise to bring greater freedom and democracy to a country
dominated for three decades by Saddam Hussein.

Well, if I may, here are some slightly revised lines from this article:

*"In a  situation like this, if you start holding elections, the people who
are rejectionists tend to win," Bremer said. "It's often the best-organized
who win, and the best-organized right now are the Republicans and to some
extent the Democrats." Bremer was referring to members of Bush's Republican
Party and religiously oriented political leaders.

 The world is fearful that fundamentalist leaders such as George W. Bush,
the current president of the United States popular in the environs of
Washington, and Colin Powell, leader of the government-supported Supreme
Council for Manifest Destiny in Iraq, would be best positioned to field
winning candidates.*

...Yes, this is a major problem for democracy.

Jimmy Breslin


June 22, 2003

On Friday, I rode across the Brooklyn Bridge, whose gray netting went with=
=20
the sky, and as long as there was tension about the bridge, I was=20
remembering Richard
Seaberg, a big cop from Emergency One, who climbed to the top of the bridge=
=20
so many times and pulled somebody down before he jumped. Seaberg protected=
 the
Brooklyn Bridge.

Now there is a charge by the government that terrorists intended to blow up=
=20
the Brooklyn Bridge, or pull it down. Simultaneously, while protecting the=
=20
bridge, the
government was doing frightening damage to the life of the country.

Because of it, I am thinking that it could be time for me to begin thinking=
=20
about leaving this news business. It is not mine anymore. Let me tell you=
 why.

Friday, the newspapers and television reported the following matter with no=
=20
anger or effort to do anything other than serve as stenographers for the=20
government:

On March 1, give or take a day, in Columbus, Ohio, the FBI arrested an=20
American citizen they say is Iyman Faris. There wasn't a word uttered. He=20
vanished. No
lawyer was notified. He made no phone calls and wrote no postcards or=
 letters.

He was a United States citizen who disappeared without a trace into a=20
secret metal world.

This citizen's proper name was Mohammed Rauf. He took the Faris from a=20
street name in his neighborhood in Columbus. I don't know why he did this=20
for sure. A
friend of mine in Columbus, Mike Weber, told me Friday that he thought the=
=20
federal agents wanted him to use Faris because the real name, Rauf,=20
purportedly would
alert others that he had been caught. Who knows? You believe the FBI, you=20
belong back in public school.

They held him secretly in an iron world for the next six weeks. This is=20
plenty of time to hand out giant beatings. Oh, yes, don't gasp. If cops are=

In mid-April, again in deep secrecy, the government says Faris was allowed=

of the old Pravda. I read in papers from everywhere yesterday morning,=20
"After Mr.

last month." They say.
They were simply typed out, as if to report the guy getting a parking=20

Yes, I know the story of Alberta's acquisition of Black Sparrow well. Here's
the very short version. In 1969, Martin put all of the materials related to
the first sixty-two BSP publications up for sale, on the condition that the
purchasing institution continue to acquire the files in perpetuity, in order
to ensure that the collection would remain intact. The University of Alberta
agreed (the arrangements were made by International Bookfinders; the cost
was 23 thousand), but after only an additional thirty-two files (seventeen
months later), refused to make any more purchases. Martin tried to buy back
the collection, but Alberta declined. Four more institutions made the same
impossible promise, and as a result the entire BSP archive is now scattered
across North America. Alberta was indeed wealthy in those days--less so
now--and has an *amazing* special collections library that includes a vast
number of 20th century poetry first editions and artist books (amongst much
else). I don't know why Buffalo didn't jump on this purchase, but I don't
think UCSD was in a position to do so at the time. I think Martin let the
archive go so far afield because he was, alas, more concerned about
continuity than geography. At any rate, the Alberta archive is catalogued
now (by me & Jason Dewinetz of greenboathouse books), and available for
research. It is, in short, an incredible resource.

Hey, wait a minute!!! Edmonton, "unlivable"?? NOT AT ALL! One of Canada's
top-ranked universities in a reasonably cool city (okay... we won't mention
the political wasteland of Alberta).

Best, Michael.

Thanks, Michael, and I did not mean to sound arrogantly dismissive of
Edmonton! But sounds, in terms of the archive, you got the interesting (to
me) early years with the Duncan, Blackburn, Dorn - a Black Mountain sweep,
before Martin got into other folks that don't spin with such a compact
related circle.  Somebody - if not already - should do a good oral history
with Martin. As a former furniture goods person - before he got into
publishing poetry - he certainly provided another kind of furniture on to
which some of the  "New American Poetry" could find a seat - one different
than New Directions.  But I personally still don't have any clear sense of
his editorial imagination or what guided the Press' choice of titles other
than a determination to find money in the poetry fold, money he discovered
either by what some might consider scam (Reznikoff, Bukowski and whoever
signing to be numbered and ltd editions of books of books before they were
ever published to make sure he had those sigs under his belt before the
authors died - I guess those might have been called "futures"!) or pressing
the envelope until he found a blue chip, such as Bukowski.  Certainly the
range of authors he published would probably never agree to be at the same
party -  something that probably might not have been true at New Directions
- where there is a greater fidelity of ancestral line.     But the Press
does have a great number of "pure" poetry titles that could never account
for much money.
So Martin remains a puzzle for me. Does his correspondence show any complex
or argumentative involvement with the poetry - contesting the authors or
whatever - or did he take most stuff in straight-up as delivered and hand it
over to Graham MacKintosh for the typesetting??

There is one interview with Martin conducted by Robert Dana in his book =
Against the Grain: Interviews with Maverick American Publishers =
(University of Iowa Press, 1986).  The interview is quite good, although =
I agree that a more extensive (and updated) interview with Martin would =
be useful, especially if it were to be conducted by someone who really =
knows the details of the press' history and its archive.  Also included =
in this book are interviews with James Laughlin, Harry Duncan, Lawrence =
Ferlinghetti, Daniel Halpern, Tree Swenson & Sam Hamill, Jonathan =
Williams, and David Godine.=20

JERUSALEM =97 Israel's military prosecutor has exonerated Israeli soldiers=
 in=20
the death of Rachel Corrie, 23, who was killed by an Israeli bulldozer in=20
March as she protested the destruction of a Palestinian home at the Rafah=20
refugee camp.

The death of Corrie, a student at The Evergreen State College in Olympia,=20
sparked debate nationally and internationally on the role and methods of=20
activists in a volatile land.

The Rafah camp, on the Egyptian border, has been one of the flashpoints in=
=20
the Mideast conflict. The army said the home being protected by Corrie was=
=20
being destroyed in an effort to block arms smuggling.
Members of her pro-Palestinian group, International Solidarity Movement,=20
claimed that Corrie was visible to the bulldozer driver and that her death=
=20
was malicious.
"When the bulldozer refused to stop or turn aside, (Rachel) climbed up onto=
=20
the mound of dirt and rubble being gathered in front of it ... to look=20
directly at the driver, who kept on advancing," the group said in a=
 statement.
Announcing the ruling, the army said the driver did not see her, claiming=20
she was standing behind a mound of earth.
Military police investigating the Corrie case found that the soldiers=20
operating the bulldozer had no intention of harming her, the army said in a=
=20
statement.
"Rachel Corrie was injured as a result of earth and building material=20
falling on her when she tried to climb on a pile of earth while work was=20
being carried out by an armored Israel Defense Forces bulldozer," the=20
statement said. "The crew of the armored bulldozer did not see Miss Corrie,=
=20
who was standing behind a pile of earth, nor could they have seen or heard=
=20
her."
"I feel I have a right to know what happened to Rachel," said Corrie's=20
sister, Sarah Simpson, 29, of Olympia. "Prime Minister Sharon promised=20
President Bush a credible investigation of her death, and we as a family=20
expect no less."
"I'm outraged, but I'm not surprised," said John Reese, a Seattle member of=
=20
the International Solidarity Movement who met Corrie soon before she left=20
for Israel. "It's the military investigating itself, so it's not surprising=
=20
that it always finds itself innocent."
"The big question now is what is the U.S. going to do about it," said=20
Kristi Schaefer, 26, of Olympia, who was Corrie's best friend.

Hi, All--

Mark: whoa:  Jimmy Breslin ready to get out of the news... but for good
reason.  What an insulting position to find oneself in after all this
life-work to honestly report.

Stephen, your poem in response to the Breslin article that Mark posted is
devastatingly real.  How much more disgusting to me will be the official
"smile" of the Bush Administration now that I have read the collisions and
slippages between "silent," "silence," [presence], "absence," and "smile."
All as states of (in)action. Poetically edgy.  Politically ominous.  Thanks
for this provocative piece.

Gabriel Gudding:
This has been an interest of mine, so I appreciate that you have followed
up.  Unfortunately the news brings more ominousness, of course.  If anyone
is interested, Arab American poet, Nathalie Handal, gave me permission to
post to my blog her elegy to Rachel.  It's in the archives, on Friday, May
30.

Another more recent highlight of the blog:
Some thoughts on the excellent Brazilian Josely Vianna Baptista's new book
of poetry, *On the Shining Screen of the Eyelids* (Manifest Press),
translated by the incomparable Chris Daniels.

Upcoming:
--Some thoughts on Mark Weiss' very fine *Figures: 32 Poems* (Chax Press)
--More Tornado Alley Countdown Love poems, #s 94 + 93
--More Sappho Series, interlinears

[Thanks, Christine, re the feedback on the posting of the Corrie article.=20
Have followed the Corrie story more closely than most due in great part to=

being a fellow alum of Evergreen, something I share w/ Kirby Olson also.=20
Anyway, thought you might be interested in Said's take on Corrie.]

The Meaning of Rachel Corrie
By Edward Said
PMC, 28/06/2003
In early May, I was in Seattle lecturing for a few days. While there, I had=
=20
dinner one night with Rachel Corrie's parents and sister, who were still=20
reeling from the shock of their daughter's murder on March 16 in Gaza by an=
=20
Israeli bulldozer. Mr. Corrie told me that he had himself driven=20
bulldozers, although the one that killed his daughter deliberately because=
=20
she was trying valiantly to protect a Palestinian home in Rafah from=20
demolition was a 60 ton behemoth especially designed by Caterpillar for=20
house demolitions, a far bigger machine than anything he had ever seen or=20
driven. Two things struck me about my brief visit with the Corries. One was=
=20
the story they told about their return to the US with their daughter's=20
body. They had immediately sought out their US Senators, Patty Murray and=20
Mary Cantwell, both Democrats, told them their story and received the=20
expected expressions of shock, outrage, anger and promises of=20
investigations. After both women returned to Washington, the Corries never=
=20
heard from them again, and the promised investigation simply didn't=20
materialize. As expected, the Israeli lobby had explained the realities to=
=20
them, and both women simply begged off. An American citizen willfully=20
murdered by the soldiers of a client state of the US without so much as an=
=20
official peep or even the de rigeur investigation that had been promised=20
her family.
But the second and far more important aspect of the Rachel Corrie story for=
=20
me was the young woman's action itself, heroic and dignified at the same=20
time. Born and brought up in Olympia, a small city 60 miles south of=20
Seattle, she had joined the International Solidarity Movement and gone to=20
Gaza to stand with suffering human beings with whom she had never had any=20
contact before. Her letters back to her family are truly remarkable=20
documents of her ordinary humanity that make for very difficult and moving=
=20
reading, especially when she describes the kindness and concern showed her=
=20
by all the Palestinians she encounters who clearly welcome her as one of=20
their own, because she lives with them exactly as they do, sharing their=20
lives and worries, as well as the horrors of the Israeli occupation and its=
=20
terrible effects on even the smallest child. She understands the fate of=20
refugees, and what she calls the Israeli government's insidious attempt at=
=20
a kind of genocide by making it almost impossible for this particular group=
=20
of people to survive. So moving is her solidarity that it inspires an=20
Israeli reservist named Danny who has refused service to write her and tell=
=20
her, " You are doing a good thing. I thank you for it."
What shines through all the letters she wrote home and which were=20
subsequently published in the London Guardian, is the amazing resistance=20
put up by the Palestinian people themselves, average human beings stuck in=
=20
the most terrible position of suffering and despair but continuing to=20
survive just the same. We have heard so much recently about the roadmap and=
=20
the prospects for peace that we have overlooked the most basic fact of all,=
=20
which is that Palestinians have refused to capitulate or surrender even=20
under the collective punishment meted out to them by the combined might of=
=20
the US and Israel. It is that extraordinary fact which is the reason for=20
the existence of a roadmap and all the numerous so-called peace plans=20
before them, not at all because the US and Israel and the international=20
community have been convinced for humanitarian reasons that the killing and=
=20
the violence must stop. If we miss that truth about the power of=20
Palestinian resistance (by which I do not at all mean suicide bombing,=20
which does much more harm than good), despite all its failings and all its=
=20
mistakes, we miss everything. Palestinians have always been a problem for=20
the Zionist project, and so-called solutions have perennially been proposed=
=20
that minimize, rather than solve, the problem. The official Israeli policy,=
=20
no matter whether Ariel Sharon uses the word "occupation" or not or whether=
=20
or not he dismantles a rusty, unused tower or two, has always been not to=20
accept the reality of the Palestinian people as equals nor ever to admit=20
that their rights were scandalously violated all along by Israel. Whereas a=
=20
few courageous Israelis over the years have tried to deal with this other=20
concealed history, most Israelis and what seems like the majority of=20
American Jews have made every effort to deny, avoid, or negate the=20
Palestinian reality. This is why there is no peace.
Moreover, the roadmap says nothing about justice or about the historical=20
punishment meted out to the Palestinian people for too many decades to=20
count. What Rachel Corrie's work in Gaza recognized, however, was precisely=
=20
the gravity and the density of the living history of the Palestinian people=
=20
as a national community, and not merely as a collection of deprived=20
refugees. That is what she was in solidarity with. And we need to remember=
=20
that that kind of solidarity is no longer confined to a small number of=20
intrepid souls here and there, but is recognized the world over. In the=20
past six months I have lectured in four continents to many thousands of=20
people. What brings them together is Palestine and the struggle of the=20
Palestinian people which is now a byword for emancipation and=20
enlightenment, regardless of all the vilification heaped on them by their=20
enemies.
Whenever the facts are made known, there is immediate recognition and an=20
expression of the most profound solidarity with the justice of the=20
Palestinian cause and the valiant struggle by the Palestinian people on its=
=20
behalf. It is an extraordinary thing that Palestine was a central issue=20
this year both during the Porto Alegre anti-globalization meetings as well=
=20
as during the Davos and Amman meetings, both poles of the world-wide=20
political spectrum. Just because our fellow citizens in this country are=20
fed an atrociously biased diet of ignorance and misrepresentation by the=20
media, when the occupation is never referred to in lurid descriptions of=20
suicide attacks, the apartheid wall 25 feet high, five feet thick, and 350=
=20
kilometers long that Israel is building is never even shown on CNN and the=
=20
networks (or so much as referred to in passing throughout the lifeless=20
prose of the roadmap), and the crimes of war, the gratuitous destruction=20
and humiliation, maiming, house demolitions, agricultural destruction, and=
=20
death imposed on Palestinian civilians are never shown for the daily,=20
completely routine ordeal that they are, one shouldn't be surprised that=20
Americans in the main have a very low opinion of Arabs and Palestinians.=20
After all, please remember that all the main organs of the establishment=20
media, from left liberal all the way over to fringe right, are unanimously=
=20
anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian. Look at the pusillanimity of=20
the media during the buildup to an illegal and unjust war against Iraq, and=
=20
look at how little coverage there was of the immense damage against Iraqi=20
society done by the sanctions, and how relatively few accounts there were=20
of the immense world-wide outpouring of opinion against the war. Hardly a=20
single journalist except Helen Thomas has taken the administration to task=
=20
for the outrageous lies and confected "facts" that were spun out about Iraq=
=20
as an imminent military threat to the US before the war, just as now the=20
same government propagandists, whose cynically invented and manipulated=20
"facts" about WMD are now more or less forgotten or shrugged off as=20
irrelevant, are let off the hook by media heavies in discussing the awful,=
=20
the literally inexcusable situation for the people of Iraq that the US has=
=20
now single-handedly and irresponsibly created there. However else one=20
blames Saddam Hussein as a vicious tyrant, which he was, he had provided=20
the people of Iraq with the best infrastructure of services like water,=20
electricity, health, and education of any Arab country. None of this is any=
=20
longer in place.
It is no wonder, then, with the extraordinary fear of seeming anti-Semitic=
=20
by criticizing Israel for its daily crimes of war against innocent unarmed=
=20
Palestinian civilians or criticizing the US government and being called=20
"anti-American" for its illegal war and its dreadfully run military=20
occupation, that the vicious media and government campaign against Arab=20
society, culture, history and mentality that has been led by Neanderthal=20
publicists and Orientalists like Bernard Lewis and Daniel Pipes, has cowed=
=20
far too many of us into believing that Arabs really are an underdeveloped,=
=20
incompetent and doomed people, and that with all the failures in democracy=
=20
and development, Arabs are alone in this world for being retarded, behind=20
the times, unmodernized, and deeply reactionary. Here is where dignity and=
=20
critical historical thinking must be mobilized to see what is what and to=20
disentangle truth from propaganda.
No one would deny that most Arab countries today are ruled by unpopular=20
regimes and that vast numbers of poor, disadvantaged young Arabs are=20
exposed to the ruthless forms of fundamentalist religion. Yet it is simply=
=20
a lie to say, as the New York Times regularly does, that Arab societies are=
=20
totally controlled, and that there is no freedom of opinion, no civil=20
institutions, no functioning social movements for and by the people. Press=
=20
laws notwithstanding, you can go to downtown Amman today and buy a=20
communist party newspaper as well as an Islamist one; Egypt and Lebanon are=
=20
full of papers and journals that suggest much more debate and discussion=20
than these societies are given credit for; the satellite channels are=20
bursting with diverse opinions in a dizzying variety; civil institutions=20
are, on many levels having to do with social services, human rights,=20
syndicates, and research institutes, very lively all over the Arab world. A=
=20
great deal more must be done before we have the appropriate level of=20
democracy, but we are on the way.
In Palestine alone there are over a 1000 NGO's and it is this vitality and=
=20
this kind of activity that has kept society going, despite every American=20
and Israeli effort made to vilify, stop or mutilate it on a daily basis.=20
Under the worst possible circumstances, Palestinian society has neither=20
been defeated nor has it crumbled completely. Kids still go to school,=20
doctors and nurses still take care of their patients, men and women go to=20
work, organizations have their meetings, and people continue to live, which=
=20
seems to be an offense to Sharon and the other extremists who simply want=20
Palestinians either imprisoned or driven away altogether. The military=20
solution hasn't worked at all, and never will work. Why is that so hard for=
=20
Israelis to see? We must help them to understand this, not by suicide=20
bombs, but by rational argument, mass civil disobedience, organized=20
protest, here and everywhere.
The point I am trying to make is that we have to see the Arab world=20
generally and Palestine in particular in more comparative and critical ways=
=20
than superficial and dismissive books like Lewis's What Went Wrong and Paul=
=20
Wolfowitz's ignorant statements about bringing democracy to the Arab and=20
Islamic world even begin to suggest. Whatever else is true about the Arabs,=
=20
there is an active dynamic at work because as real people they live in a=20
real society with all sorts of currents and crosscurrents in it that can't=
=20
be easily caricatured as just one seething mass of violent fanaticism. The=
=20
Palestinian struggle for justice is especially something with which one=20
expresses solidarity, rather than endless criticism and exasperated,=20
frustrating discouragement, and crippling divisiveness. Remember the=20
solidarity here and everywhere in Latin America, Africa, Europe, Asia and=20
Australia, and remember also that there is a cause to which many people=20
have committed themselves, difficulties and terrible obstacles=20
notwithstanding. Why? Because it is a just cause, a noble ideal, a moral=20
quest for equality and human rights.
I want now to speak about dignity, which of course has a special place in=20
every culture known to historians, anthropologists, sociologists and=20
humanists. I shall begin by saying immediately that it is a radically wrong=
=20
Orientalist, and indeed racist proposition to accept that, unlike Europeans=
=20
and Americans, Arabs have no sense of individuality, no regard for=20
individual life, no values that express love, intimacy and understanding=20
that are supposed to be the property exclusively of cultures like those of=
=20
Europe and America that had an Renaissance, a Reformation and an=20
Enlightenment. Among many others, it is the vulgar and jejune Thomas=20
Friedman who has been peddling this rubbish, which has alas been picked up=
=20
by equally ignorant and self-deceiving Arab intellectuals I don't need to=20
mention any names here who have seen in the atrocities of 9/11 a sign that=
=20
the Arab and Islamic worlds are somehow more diseased and more=20
dysfunctional than any other, and that terrorism is a sign of a wider=20
distortion that has occurred in any other culture.
We can leave to one side that, between them, Europe and the US account for=
=20
by far the largest number of violent deaths during the 20th century, the=20
Islamic world hardly a fraction of it. And behind all of that specious=20
unscientific nonsense about wrong and right civilizations, there is the=20
grotesque shadow of the great false prophet Samuel Huntington who has led a=
=20
lot of people to believe that the world can be divided into distinct=20
civilizations battling against each other forever. On the contrary,=20
Huntington is dead wrong on every point he makes. No culture or=20
civilization exists by itself; none is made up of things like individuality=
=20
and enlightenment that are completely exclusive to it; and none exists=20
without the basic human attributes of community, love, value for life and=20
all the others. To suggest otherwise as he does is the purest invidious=20
racism of the same stripe as people who argue that Africans have naturally=
=20
inferior brains, or that Asians are really born for servitude, or that=20
Europeans are a naturally superior race. This is a sort of parody of=20
Hitlerian science directed uniquely today against Arab and Muslims, and we=
=20
must be very firm as to not even go through the motions of arguing against=
=20
it. It is the purest drivel. On the other hand, there is the much more=20
credible and serious stipulation that, like every other instance of=20
humanity, Arab and Muslim life has an inherent value and dignity which are=
=20
expressed by Arabs and Muslims in their unique cultural style, and those=20
expressions needn't resemble or be a copy of one approved model suitable=20
for everyone to follow.
The whole point about human diversity is that it is in the end a form of=20
deep co-existence between very different styles of individuality and=20
experience that can't all be reduced to one superior form: this is the=20
spurious argument foisted on us by pundits who bewail the lack of=20
development and knowledge in the Arab world. All one has to do is to look=20
at the huge variety of literature, cinema, theater, painting, music and=20
popular culture produced by and for Arabs from Morocco to the Gulf. Surely=
=20
that needs to be assessed as an indication of whether or not Arabs are=20
developed, and not just how on any given day statistical tables of=20
industrial production either indicate an appropriate level of development=20
or they show failure.
The more important point I want to make, though, is that there is a very=20
wide discrepancy today between our cultures and societies and the small=20
group of people who now rule these societies. Rarely in history has such=20
power been so concentrated in so tiny a group as the various kings,=20
generals, sultans, and presidents who preside today over the Arabs. The=20
worst thing about them as a group, almost without exception, is that they=20
do not represent the best of their people. This is not just a matter of no=
=20
democracy. It is that they seem to radically underestimate themselves and=20
their people in ways that close them off, that make them intolerant and=20
fearful of change, frightened of opening up their societies to their=20
people, terrified most of all that they might anger big brother, that is,=20
the United States. Instead of seeing their citizens as the potential wealth=
=20
of the nation, they regard them all as guilty conspirators vying for the=20
ruler's power.
This is the real failure, how during the terrible war against the Iraqi=20
people, no Arab leader had the self-dignity and confidence to say something=
=20
about the pillaging and military occupation of one of the most important=20
Arab countries. Fine, it was an excellent thing that Saddam Hussein's=20
appalling regime is no more, but who appointed the US to be the Arab=20
mentor? Who asked the US to take over the Arab world allegedly on behalf of=
=20
it citizens and bring it something called "democracy," especially at a time=
=20
when the school system, the health system, and the whole economy in America=
=20
are degenerating into the worst levels since the 1929 Depression. Why was=20
the collective Arab voice NOT raised against the US's flagrantly illegal=20
intervention, which did so much harm and inflicted so much humiliation upon=
=20
the entire Arab nation? This is truly a colossal failure in nerve, in=20
dignity, in self-solidarity.
With all the Bush administration's talk about guidance from the Almighty,=20
doesn't one Arab leader have the courage just to say that, as a great=20
people, we are guided by our own lights and traditions and religion? But=20
nothing, not a word, as the poor citizens of Iraq live through the most=20
terrible ordeals and the rest of the region quakes in its collective boots,=
=20
each one petrified that his country may be next. How unfortunate the=20
embrace of George Bush, the man whose war destroyed an Arab country=20
gratuitously, by the combined leadership of the major Arab countries last=20
week. Was there no one there who had the guts to remind George W. what he=20
has done to humiliate and bring more suffering to the Arab people than=20
anyone before him, and must he always be greeted with hugs, smiles, kisses=
=20
and low bows? Where is the diplomatic and political and economic support=20
necessary to sustain an anti-occupation movement on the West Bank and Gaza?=
=20
Instead all one hears is that foreign ministers preach to the Palestinians=
=20
to mind their ways, avoid violence, and keep at the peace negotiations,=20
even though it has been so obvious that Sharon's interest in peace is just=
=20
about zero. There has been no concerted Arab response to the separation=20
wall, or to the assassinations, or to collective punishment, only a bunch=20
of tired clich=E9s repeating the well-worn formulas authorized by the State=
=20
Department.
Perhaps the one thing that strikes me as the low point in Arab inability to=
=20
grasp the dignity of the Palestinian cause is expressed by the current=20
state of the Palestinian Authority. Abu Mazen, a subordinate figure with=20
little political support among his own people, was picked for the job by=20
Arafat, Israel, and the US precisely because he has no constituency, is not=
=20
an orator or a great organizer, or anything really except a dutiful aide to=
=20
Yasir Arafat, and because I am afraid they see in him a man who will do=20
Israel's bidding, how could even Abu Mazen stand there in Aqaba to=20
pronounce words written for him, like a ventriloquist's puppet, by some=20
State Department functionary, in which he commendably speaks about Jewish=20
suffering but then amazingly says next to nothing about his own people's=20
suffering at the hands of Israel? How could he accept so undignified and=20
manipulated a role for himself, and how could he forget his self-dignity as=
=20
the representative of a people that has been fighting heroically for its=20
rights for over a century just because the US and Israel have told him he=20
must? And when Israel simply says that there will be a "provisional"=20
Palestinian state, without any contrition for the horrendous amount of=20
damage it has done, the uncountable war crimes, the sheer sadistic=20
systematic humiliation of every single Palestinian, man, woman, child, I=20
must confess to a complete lack of understanding. As to why a leader or=20
representative of that long-suffering people doesn't so much as take note=20
of it. Has he entirely lost his sense of dignity?
Has he forgotten that since he is not just an individual but also the=20
bearer of his people's fate at an especially crucial moment? Is there=20
anyone who was not bitterly disappointed at this total failure to rise to=20

since Haj Amin, a combination of misplaced juvenile defiance and plaintive=

read scripts written for them by their enemies? The basic dignity of our=20
life as Arabs in Palestine, throughout the Arab world, and here in America,=

is that we are our own people, with a heritage, a history, a tradition and=
=20
above all a language that is more than adequate to the task of representing=

our real aspirations, since those aspirations derive from the experience of=

dispossession and suffering that has been imposed on each Palestinian since=

1948. Not one of our political spokespeople the same is true of the Arabs=20
since Abdel Nasser's time ever speaks with self-respect and dignity of what=

we are, what we want, what we have done, and where we want to go.
Slowly, however, the situation is changing, and the old regime made up of=20
the Abu Mazens and Abu Ammars of this world, is passing and will gradually=

be replaced by a new set of emerging leaders all over the Arab world. The=20
most promising is made up of the members of the National Palestinian=20

while also fending off daily Israeli attacks. Second, these are people=20

that in order to do that, a representative national unified leadership be=20

ineffectiveness that have plagued Palestinian leaders for the past century.

Rachel Corrie and the two young people wounded with her from ISM, Tom=20
Hurndall and Brian Avery, have felt it possible to express their solidarity=

with us.
I conclude with one last irony. Isn't it astonishing that all the signs of=

popular solidarity that Palestine and the Arabs receive occur with no=20

realize, as a first step, that they are fighting for a just and noble=20

know I do COMBO mag but am also launching COMBO BOOKS this Fall - 1st book I'm
publishing is Kasey Mohammad's A THOUSAND DEVILS (110 pp, a kind of New &
Selected).  May, June or July would work great for me if you're interested.

Thanks,  Mike.

Gabriel,

Thanks very much for posting the Said--a noteworthy approach he takes, using
the occasion in part as a platform to spur more (much needed) proactive
approaches from Arab countries.  As a writer, Said's expository mix is
always interesting.  I found this a provocative one and have posted an
excerpt on Texfiles (with a link to Conchology--I hope you don't mind?).

Thank you very much for this, m

I have been red-faced ever since I did this last week.
I feel so much better knowing I am not alone
Fortunately, people on Poetics are kind.

PS I am hoping to be in NYC for at least some of Boog City's non-NY Press
events.  They sound very interesting.

well,
thanks for the suggestion. it's the only one i got. the thing is that you
can't buy a 2-4 of beer in newfoundland. unlike most other canadian
provinces beer here is sold at the local corner store so there isn't the
space for the big case. a six is a half case.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Two concerts I wanted to let everyone know about, taking place the next two
weekends at Signal 66, the Mt. Vernon Sq artspace. They're being put on to
benefit the annual Dissociated Writer's Project conference.


July 5: John Sinclair, Cool Candy, Paul Sidewinder

John Sinclair was the promoter for the MC5 and founder of the White Panther
Party. In the seventies he was locked up for seven years for possession of a
joint. He now does spoken word with a blues back-up band.
Cool Candy plays good rock and roll.
Paul Sidewinder is the author of two books of poetry: I, Hippopotamus; and
Pearl Necklaces, and other Things My Granpa Gave Me. He will be reading
poetry with eerie background music.


July 12: Thee Snuff Project, I’m Really Happy for You!/Guaranteed, Sounds of
Kaleidoscope

Thee Snuff Project is generally considered the best rock'n'roll band in DC.
CNN came to film them once. Which was the night that the audience wouldn't
leave until Thee Snuff Project played their whole set over again.
I'm Really Happy for You!/Guaranteed is a side-project of Matt from Touhy,
in which he puts Funkadelic in the mix and sings into a gas mask.
Sounds of Kaleidoscope is seventies psychadelic music, with video backdrop
of people waking up from a nightmare.

Both concert dates @: Signal 66
Signal 66 is at 926 N Street REAR NW, between
10th and 9th Streets, in Blagden Alley, right by the
new convention center. Nearest Metro: Mt.
Vernon Sq. $6 at the door.



The Dissociated Writers Project
The DWP is a DC-area-based collective of artists &
writers interested in illumination, inspiration, natural
creativity. Anything that causes laughter, as in dumb
things or overly smart things. Things unknown to
science, or known but with skepticism. Silence, etc.

Hi there Kevin Hehir, perhaps you could find a title for your series in Alan
Davies’s writings, and thereby pay a surreptitious homage to the New York
exile? Did you know that A. Davies is a long-lost Newfoundlander poet? At
least, he was born there, and spent time there. The Writers Alliance of
Newfoundland and Labrador might even consider recognizing Alan as an
honorary member and award him a porcelain buttered lobster (with or without
leash), a cod jigging line for illegal versifying on the dory o' langorage,
and Francis Eterovich’s Approaches to Natural Law from Plato to Kant (signed
by Aaron Vidaver), but it's not necessary, and certainly wouldn't affect
your titling decision based on his works.

Spicer, I think, appeals to the young because his poetry is filled with
strong, resonant statements which are simultaneously denied, undermined,
negated, just as young people are prone to large statements they don't
"mean" the very next second.

Gee, not having the rest of this conversation at hand, I can say that Spicer
has appealed to legions, regardless of age.  One might make a case for
Rimbaud's appeal to youth, as his rather romantic denouncements of poetry
belie his remarkable language.  But Spicer? The denial, undermining, negating
is also true of Ashbery who often derails one clause as he moves to another.
 Sometimes Spicer is a hard sell to young poets--especially his lectures and
Martian references--one has to put them in the context of the era, radio, etc.
 But reading Spicer with Lorca--a pleasure.  In fact, it was Spicer who
introduced many to Lorca, and then the world opens.

Dear Kevin Hehir: Don't pay any attention to Dr. Cabri.
The more we attend to his tertiary arguments, the more he
is able to get away with in his primary and secondary
ones. The envy in his remarks is astounding. Especially
the proposal to award the copy of Eterovich's Approaches
that I inscribed to Darren Wershler-Henry instead of
himself. Any Newfoundland series ought to be called Dildo
and have an accompanying journal publication by the same
name. There are, of course, many other wonderful place
names on and about that fine piece of rock that could
serve this purpose as well, depending on the nature of
your politics.
