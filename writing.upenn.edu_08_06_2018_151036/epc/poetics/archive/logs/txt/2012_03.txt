Shearsman Books rocks my world =97 again! Like my previous collection
(Sonnets), Looms will appear from Shearsman, a UK literary press that
publishes about sixty new titles per year.

Unless predictions of Doomsday 2012 come true, Looms will loom on the
horizon in fall 2012.

Cheers!

Dear friends,

Because of your generosity, we are 65% funded, and there are only 28 days
to go!  We hope that you will tell your friends and colleagues about this
project and share it because it is our collective dream that it will be
funded.  Remember, that Kickstarter grants do not get funded unless they
reach 100%, and we very much want to deliver our sponsors the rewards they
have ordered.  Our last Kickstarter grant was funded so we are optimistic,
but please keep sharing and liking on the social media networks below and
beyond.

Our launch party is May 5 at the Flying Carpet Cafe and Bar in the
Francisville section of Philadelphia (near the Art Museum).  The event will
feature the opening of a month long exhibition featuring our artists,
including cover artist Kevin Von Holtermann, Aja Beech, Richardson
Comly, warren longmire, Jody McGrath, and Janice Sloane, among others. You
will be entertained by film and video work as well as live performances
from our contributors and several of our supporters.  So please put this
evening in your calendars, and save the date.   Become a fan of the Flying
Carpet on Facebook: www.facebook.com/FLYPHL

Our latest online issue is up: certaincircuits.org (The image below is a
screen capture of our latest artists.)  Thank you again for your tremendous
generosity, and we encourage you to submit to future issues.

True. It's nice to be invited to parties but not always wise to attend.

Frederica

A Sequence of Poems

by Stephen Knauth

"Frederica is based on the life of a young Indiana woman who lost her
fiance in the First World War. She married soon after but her husband,
also a veteran of the war, died suddenly of pneumonia, leaving her to
raise three children during the Depression. In 1939, she was legally
declared insane and committed to Evansville State Hospital. In subsequent
years she was released to live with her grown children but ultimately she
was recommitted to the same asylum and died there in 1957. The story is
drawn, in part, from medical records, hometown newspaper articles, and
oral/aural family history. Frederica is my grandmother." SK

Stephen Knauth's latest collection of poetry is The River I Know You By
from Four Way Books. His poems have appeared in North American Review,
Virginia Quarterly Review, Prairie Schooner, Poetry Daily, The Cortland
Review, and others.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

"once upon a time, way way back in October 1994, rob mclennan & James
Spyker invented a two-day event called the ottawa small press book fair,
and held the first one at the National Archives of Canada..." Spyker moved
to Toronto soon after our original event, but the fair continues, thanks
in part to the help of generous volunteers, various writers and
publishers, and the public for coming out to participate with alla their
love and their dollars.

Dear Friends of the National Poetry Foundation,

As the March 15 deadline for paper and panel proposals draws near, I
wonder if I could ask for your help in spreading the news about our
conference to friends, students, and other potential participants who
may not have seen the call that first went out just before the Buffalo
MSA in October.

	www.nationalpoetryfoundation.wordpress.com/2011/10/03/poetry-poetics-of-the-1980s-call-for-proposals/

We recognize that there has been a real "boom" in conference offerings
in recent years and that it is getting difficult to choose among the
many tempting alternatives.

Still, we hope you'll agree that the legacy of the Orono conferences
is one well worth continuing, and that the blend of scholarly papers
and poetry readings, along with the bookfair and the many
opportunities to meet and talk intensively with other poets and
scholars, makes for a distinctive experience that only rolls around
once every four years.

International scholars traveling from outside the U.S., graduate
students, and independent scholars and artists are encouraged to
inquire about reduced, and in some cases fully waived, registration
rates. We can also offer tips on how best to get to Orono by plane,
bus, or car.

On behalf of fellow organizing committee members Carla Billitteri and
Benjamin Friedlander, please accept our warm best wishes and high
hopes for seeing many of you here in late June,

Steve

Poetry & Poetics of the 1980s - Call for Proposals<http://nationalpoetryfou=

Poetry & Poetics of the 1980s - Call for Proposals



National Poetry Foundation, University of Maine
June 27-July 1, 2012

Direct 300-500 word proposals for 20 minute papers
to NPF_Paideuma@umit.maine.edu



The Editorial Collective of the National Poetry Foundation invites paper an=
d panel proposals for the next in our sequence of "decade" conferences, to =
be devoted to The Poetry and Poetics of the 1980s, American and internation=
al, and to be held from Wednesday to Sunday, June 27-July 1, 2012, on the f=
lagship campus of the University of Maine System in Orono, Maine.

The NPF welcomes paper and panel proposals on any and all aspects of poetic=
 practice in the decade of the 1980s. What emerged? What changed? What happ=
ened just out of frame? What connections brought poetry into dialog with ot=
her fields? What social and political contexts mattered most? What of the p=
resent can be traced back to that moment? What poets, poetic formations, te=
ndencies in poetics warrant our continued attention? What accidents of rece=
ption might we now revisit and perhaps repair?

Prospective participants are encouraged to draw on the full range of archiv=
al resources in conceiving their projects, including the digital audio, dig=
ital video, and digital facsimile holdings now widely available on-line.

As with previous NPF conferences, the scholarly presentations and panels wi=
ll be amply supplemented by a variety of poetry readings, including plenary=
 readings by notable figures associated with the decade being explored.

Paper proposals consisting of a title and a brief (300-500 word) abstract s=
hould be directed to the NPF Editorial Collective at NPF_Paideuma@umit.main=
e.edu. Panel proposals should include, in addition, a brief rationale for t=
he envisioned grouping. Proposals for alternative forms of intellectual pra=
ctice/presentation, such as roundtables or seminars, will be read with inte=
rest.

The deadline for proposals has been extended to March 15, 2012.

Continuous Frieze Bordering Red

Continuous Frieze Bordering Red documents the migratory patterns=20
of an Other=2C as she travels between countries=2C languages=2C seasons=2C =
and=20
shifting identities. A narrative on hybridity=2C the text explores=20
[dis]location as a cultural swerve while it interrogates Rothko's red:=20
his bricked-in=2C water-damaged windows [floating borders]=2C which reflect=
=20
unstable cultural borders to the hybrid. A person of mixed race [hybrid=2C
 mongrel=2C mutt] traverses these "invisible" cultural borders repeatedly.
 Border identity comes with flux=2C instability=2C and vibrational pulls. A=
n
 Other is marked as someone who does not belong. She is always a=20
foreigner: when traveling and when at "home." She is cast aside=2C=20
bracketed from the dominant culture. She is [neither][nor][both]. She=20
exists in a liminal space: in place and displaced simultaneously. That=20
is=2C her identity and body are peripatetic=2C which is reflected in the=20
continuous horizontal frieze. The reader must literally cross the=20
borders of each page in order to navigate each line of text=2C leaving the
 reader in constant motion as well. The poem also functions as an=20
ekphrasis of Rothko's Seagram murals: Rothko writes that the paintings=20
make the observers "feel that they are trapped in a room where all the=20
doors and windows are bricked up." The hybrid is confined and isolated.=20
Even though the Other is estranged from herself and desires a sense of=20
cultural belonging=2C she ultimately wants to "acknowledge this scar=20
tissue and proceed" so that she is not held to false measures of=20
"purity." Continuous Frieze Bordering Red attempts to move away from pejora=
tive definitions of "hybrid" and embrace the monstrous self.

"Interruptions mingle with saturations=2C private intensities with social=20
commentary=2C lyric aper=EF=BF=BDus with skeptical suspicion-this multi-tra=
ck=20
work by Michelle Naka Pierce correlates many streams of insight and=20
produces elegant and self-assured results."=20

Dear all (and with apologies for cross-posting),

I'm really delighted to say that Denise Riley is to read and talk at
the University of Sheffield. Details as follows:


Poetry Reading - Denise Riley

Where: Tapestry Room, Firth Hall, Western Bank, Sheffield

When:

7pm Thursday 15th March 2012

Denise Riley (born 1948, Carlisle) is an English poet and philosopher
who began to be published in the 1970s. Her poetry is remarkable for
its paradoxical interrogation of selfhood within the lyric mode. Her
critical writings on motherhood, women in history, identity, and
philosophy of language, are recognised as an important contribution to
Feminism and Contemporary Philosophy. She was, until recently,
Professor of Literature with Philosophy at the University of East
Anglia and is currently A. D. White Professor at Cornell University.
She was formerly Writer in Residence at Tate Gallery London, and has
held fellowships at Brown University and at Birkbeck, University of
London.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CSonglines=E2=80=9D by Iain B=
ritton

Description:
=20
These poems touch on the experimental, the alternative, and rely on space a=
nd imagery for impact, and should be treated as living entities. Each poem =
should take the reader on a journey. They are multilayered and many everyda=
y themes interconnect them, and the use of mnemonics adds a strengthening d=
imension to the symbolism.

A CELEBRATION OF WORD AND MUSIC, for

St. Patrick's Day,
Saturday, March 17th, 2012
10:30 a.m.

CLOQUET PUBLIC LIBRARY,
320 Fourteenth Street,
Cloquet, Minnesota,
U.S.A., 55720 - 2051

St. Patrick's Day will be celebrated with a literary reading and
traditional Irish music at the Cloquet Public Library at 10:30 a.m.,
Saturday, March 17th. =A0American-Irish author and Cloquet native S=E9amas
Cain will read from his recently published poetry-novel =93The Dangerous
Islands.=94 =A0The reading will be accompanied by music performed on the
Celtic harp and penny whistle by Mary Hagen and Linda Crumpton.

All proceeds from the sale of =93The Dangerous Islands=94 at this event
will go to support the Programming Department at the Cloquet Public
Library.

S=E9amas Cain is a poet, playwright, conceptual artist, performance
artist, and theater director, who has written about Ireland for many
years. =A0Born in Cloquet, he has been active in Irish artistic and
political circles since his first involvements in Northern Ireland in
the 1960s. =A0The Northern Ireland conflict, known as =93The Troubles,=94
was an early focus of his essays, pamphlets, and manifestos. =A0In an
essay written in Northern Ireland in 1968, Cain expressed his
understanding of the struggle of the Irish Civil Rights Movement as a
hope to create a non-violent and humanist movement against the tyranny
of the British Establishment while deploring the =93mindless violence=94
of the paramilitaries.

Ireland's struggles form the backdrop of his most recent work, =93The
Dangerous Islands.=94 =A0=93The Dangerous Islands=94 is an unconventional
novel that combines aspects of various genres, including poetry and
play script, in conveying the experience of a young Irish-American man
from 1965 to 1998.

Francis M. Carroll, author of =93The Fires of Autumn : The Cloquet-Moose
Lake Disaster of 1918=94 and =93Crossroads in Time : A History of Carlton
County, Minnesota,=94 has written that Cain's novel =93invites the reader
into a kaleidoscope of colors, sounds and images. =A0The experience is
both intensely personal and cosmic. =A0S=E9amas Cain's work comes out of
the world of ancient Celtic sagas, out of the s=E9ances of William
Butler Yeats, out of T.S. Eliot's desert wastelands, and especially
out of James Joyce's play with language. =A0He takes the reader to
mysterious islands, as well as dangerous islands.=94

Mr. Cain has been the recipient of grants from the IMRAM Festival in
Ireland, the Minnesota State Arts Board, the McKnight Foundation, and
the Arrowhead Regional Arts Council, among other organizations. =A0He
describes his novel as =93a non-Classic coming-of-age tale. =A0It is a
story of self-education and self-development, with convictions and
disillusionment. =A0But it resists all pigeonholing, for it is also a
novel of ideas ranging across literature, philosophy and politics.=94

=93The Dangerous Islands=94 has been published in Ireland by The Red
Jasper Press, an independent publishing house under the curatorship of
Dr. Kit Fryatt, lecturer in English at the Mater Dei Institute of
Education, a part of Dublin City University. =A0Dr. Fryatt organizes
activities of the Irish Centre for Poetry Studies, in which Mr. Cain
has contributed. =A0The book's preface has been written by
American-Irish poet Sheila E. Murphy.

Mary Hagen has been a local harper for many years. =A0Linda Crumpton is
a member of a Celtic music group that performs regularly at Carmody's
Irish Pub in Duluth, Minnesota. =A0Both musicians are Cloquet residents.

Copies of =93The Dangerous Islands=94 are available through Berkeley Books
of Paris, France; Housmans Bookshop in London, England; Boekie Woekie
of Amsterdam, The Netherlands; The Loft Bookshop and Gregory Carr
Books in Dublin; Magers & Quinn in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and the UMD
Bookstores in Duluth. =A0For more information about availability, scroll

"Like tectonic plates drifting apart and colliding, Cheryl Pallant&#8217;s =
language in Continental Drifts shatters into microcosmic worlds and re-coal=
esces into new contours, expressing desire afresh. The ceaseless motion of =
destruction and re-alignment, of fertility and quiescence, is also the engi=
ne that propels speech into meanings yet just as soon incinerates them. In =
Pallant&#8217;s exquisitely musical streams of thought, forces in different=
 realms coincide"... Camille Martin

Jonathan,

I don't know about your students, but I cringe and immediately know the
political stripe of someone when he/she says "democrats party." I find it
offensive, personally offensive.

Subject:      new from above/ground press: Shikibu Shuffle,
              a collaboration between Andrew Burke and Phil Hall

Shikibu Shuffle
Andrew Burke and Phil Hall
$4

published in Ottawa by above/ground press
March 2012
a/g subscribers receive a complimentary copy

    Happy fate brought a poet from Perth Western Australia and a poet from
    Perth Ontario Canada together in 2009.

    Then Andrew had a heart attack and was queued up for life-saving surgery.

    With nothing to do but wait, kept alive by sprays and medical potions
    to distract himself  Andrew agreed to work with Phil on a collaboration.

    Andrew suggested the Japanese court poet Murasaki Shikibu (973-1014);
    her 5-line form might be a place to start.

    Phil was thinking of Ornette Coleman: two quartets facing each other
    and going at it (1960).

    We wrote in 5s back and forth, then shuffled our silence-inducing
    cacophony into 10s, then improvised from there...

    Andrew's operation was bumped once, and then happened. He's fine.

    The shuffle served its purpose, and now surprises and delights them both.


Andrew Burke was born in Victoria, but raised in Western Australia. Since
the mid-Sixties, he has published nine collections  of poetry. His most
recent book of poems is QWERTY- take my word for it (Mulla Mulla Press,
2011). He has also published short stories, a novel, and criticism. He has
lectured at universities in Australia and China. Readers may read his
daily musings at http://hispirits.blogspot.com/

Phil Hall is the 2011 winner of the Governor General's Award for Poetry in
English for his book Killdeer (BookThug). Other recent titles are The
Little Seamstress (Pedlar Press, 2010) and White Porcupine (Bookthug,
2007). He is a member of the Writers' Union of Canada. Everything escapes him.

I have a hystory of making work out of materials sourced from multiple =
contributors.=20

During the past three years I have been performing live texts using =
projected text-image sequences as a springboard for interdisciplinary =
improvised performance. In essence these are lo-fi pieces that combine =
various approaches to textual enactment and reenactment through =
interpretation, tonal semantics, commentary, extended vocalization, song =
. . . somewhat exploring the borderlands between a lecture, a paper, a =
talk, a poem and a graphic score. Those who have witnessed any of this =
work will also know that i do not stand to one side of the projections =
but stand in them, and that i incrementally incorporate documentation =
into each successive version, to the extent that i do what the fabulous =
photographer Jo Spence urged; i put myself in the picture. The writing =
gets all over my body. The resultant highly embodied work gradually =
includes interventions by others and the status of variant documentation =
of the work being made becomes part of the emergent and ongoing text.=20

I am making a piece of work for the ELMCIP conference Remediating the =
Social and i need your help to make it. My title is remediating the =
social and I want the perspectives presented by the piece, as i explore =
what remediating the social might mean, to be as radically inclusive as =
possible. Hence I am seeking massively multiple contributions of =
material.=20

I will credit everybody who participates, in every instantiation of the =
work produced (i hope in the end to include aspects of this piece in an =
electronic book too). Something approximating this call for =
contributions will accompany every version of the work, listing all =
those who contributed to its making (unless people self-identify as =
wishing not to be listed).

Here's how you can help (please feel free to contribute one or the other =
or both):


1. email me an image (a sourced photo or a photo you take, or a drawing =
you make or an animated gif you assemble . .) that says something (for =
you) about the concept and or your understanding of the meaning and =
interpretation and/or experience of remediation

2. tweet me @friedpudding (if you have a twitter account and if you do =
not have a twitter account then email me a short text (no more than 140 =
characters)) offering your thoughts on / critiques of / aspirations for  =
. . . the social  =20

- IF you have more to say than can be constrained by 140 characters then =
please send me a sequence of texts and i will deal with them in those =
units


N.B. I am circulating this invitation widely and it is expected that =
many contributions will be critical . . do not be concerned about being =
critical, jaded, cynical, silly, obstructive . . . DO use multiple =
languages and languages other than English if you so wish . .=20


Deadline: March 31st. I hope to begin making the work during April and =
will continue during the summer. I might circulate a second call, but =
i'm hoping that I can get enough contributions to begin to work with =
asap.=20


I will subsequently work with whatever materials i receive to develop a =
live presentation for the conference in Glasgow. I will be sharing this =
as work in progress at the UCF ELMCIP seminar - Arnolfini Bristol, on =
Friday May 4 and show the work at the Edinburgh College of Art, October =
31 - November 2, 2012.=20


THANK YOU so much, in advance

hugely looking forwards,


cris

"William Carlos Williams writes of a poem as a machine made of words. A
machine not just in the way a text is carefully constructed, calibrated,
tested and refined during the writing process, but because, like a machine,
a piece of writing does something, has the potential to cause change, to
make things happen." What's this text-machine doing to our brains?

Finally, something practical.  I made a bunch of vispo Tshirt in the
early 80s and I wore them until the were not wearable anymore and
threw them away.  How many books of poetry can you say that about....

Subject:      Pamela Lu Reading in Chicago
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

*Kenning Editions happily welcomes Pamela Lu to Chicago, for a rare
visit to the Midwest, reading from her novel /Ambient Parking Lot/ (2011).
*
Sunday, April 22nd, 4:00 PM at the Logan Square Comfort Station, 2579 N.
Milwaukee Avenue. The event is free and the venue is ADA accessible.

Ambient Parking Lot is a 187-page book about one band's quest to capture
the world's most perfect ambient noise in a parking lot. Wait, don't go
away! It's great ... I swear. It's dizzying, really, and hilarious.
---Cooper Berkmoyer, /San Francisco Bay Guardian
/
Lu's book looks at the cerebral struggle of artmaking and of ambient
music: as struggle between the problems of the language of the
individual and the language of the collective.
---Devin King, /Make Magazine
/
The Ambient Parkers' yen for recognition seems to be a residual effect
of their desire to create something that matters, but what their message
or the content of that matter might be is always skirted over or slides
into something new. In this way, Lu captures---and mocks as well,
perhaps, but lovingly---the existential pretenses of artistic endeavors.
In the end, Lu suggests that despite the absurdities and shifting
metamorphoses inherent in human effort, the greatest grace and sense of
humanity comes from attending, from recognizing that the deathly silence
we fear is in fact fully populated and alive once we quiet ourselves. By
the novel's end, ambience takes on new meaning, and doesn't require our
torturously theorized amplifications but graces us when we quietly
acknowledge it.
---Sueyeun Juliette Less, /The Constant Critic/

What I love about Lu's work is her sharp wit, subtle delivery and
deadpan hilarity, which you have to slow down and listen for in order to
fully appreciate. Thus, parked, I listened.
---Jai Arun Ravine, /Lantern Reviews
/
Part fiction, part earnest mockumentary, /Ambient Parking Lot/
<http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9780976736431/ambient-parking-lot.aspx> follows
a band of musicians as they wander the parking structures of urban
downtown and greater suburbia in quest of the ultimate ambient* *noise,
one that promises to embody their historical moment and deliver them up
to the heights of their self-important artistry. Along the way, they
make sporadic forays into lyric while contending with doubts, delusions,
miscalculations, mutinies, and minor triumphs. This saga peers into the
wreckage of a post 9/11 landscape and embraces the comedy and poignancy
of failed utopia.

/Ambient Parking Lot/ is the much anticipated second book by Pamela Lu.
Portions of this book were previously published in /Chicago Review/ and
/Harper's/. She is also the author of/ Pamela: A Novel /and /The Private
Listener/, a chapbook from Corollary Press. /Pamela: A Novel /is on the
decade's bestsellers list from Small Press Distribution, and has been
taught in a number of literature and creative writing classes. Her
writing also appears in the anthologies /Bay Poetics/ and /Biting the
Error/, and has been published in periodicals such as /1913/,
/Antennae/, /Call/, /Chain/, and /Fascicle/. She lives and works in the
San Francisco Bay Area.

On Pamela Lu's previous novel---"/Pamela: A Novel/ is one of the finest
books to emerge from the ardent, experimental writing scene in the Bay
Area . . . Lu builds a social space and founds a society."---/The
Stranger/ / "Reading the word 'I' in this novel becomes a mystical
experience---an invitation to connect to the 'I' in all of us . . . This
is a work of 'precision,' as Robert Musil would say, 'in matters of the
soul.' It extends the novel's capacity to think."---/Rain Taxi Review of
Books/ / "Lu, in her debut, . . . [creates] a precise and humorous elegy
to the self, and to its self-subversions . . . This is a book of
extraordinary philosophical subtlety and clarity, one that manages to
tell a beautiful story in spite of itself."---/Publishers Weekly/

Comfort Station <http://http//www.comfortstationlogansquare.com/> is a
turn-of-the-century structure turned multidisciplinary arts space in the
heart of Chicago's Logan Square. Originally a resting place for tired
travelers, it now plays host to artists from all walks of life, and to
anyone with an interesting idea. As the only structure of its kind still
standing along the entire boulevard system, Comfort Station represents
the preservation of a neighborhood rich in history, while playing host

Thanks, Murat! If you're interested, I've now updated that post with two
items. The second one says the pond will now be renamed; the probably
more interesting one mentions a the case of equipping the word "Negro"
(originally an adjective with a small n, then a noun with a capital n)
with a brand new adjective: "Negroic."

But oh yes I do wish the Democrats had started saying "Publican Party"
back in the 1940s, when the idea was proposed. Nobody reads the King
James Bible now, but seventy years ago people would have gotten the
allusion: "thieves and publicans."

CEREBUS THE BARBARIAN MESSIAH: ESSAYS ON THE EPIC GRAPHIC SATIRE OF DAVE
SIM AND GERHARD
Edited by Eric Hoffman

*About the Book*
In December 1977, struggling Canadian comic book artist Dave Sim
self-published the first issue of *Cerebus the Aardvark*, and *Conan the
Barbarian* satire featuring a foul-tempered, sword-wielding creature
trapped in a human world. Over the next 26 years, Sim, and later
collaborator Gerhard, produced an epic 6,000-page graphic novel, the
longest-running English language comic series by a single creative team.
They revolutionized the comics medium by showing other artists that they
too could forgo major publishers, paving the way for such successes as *Tee=
nage
Mutant Ninja Turtles* and *Bone*. This in-depth work, the first collection
of critical essays on *Cerebus*, provides a multifaceted approach to Sim
and Gerhard=EF=BF=BDs complex and entertaining oeuvre, including their inno=
vative
use of the comic medium, storytelling and satiric techniques, technical and
visual sophistication, and Sim=EF=BF=BDs use of the comic as commentary on =
gender
and religion.
*About the Author*
*Eric Hoffman*, a poet and essayist, is the author of six books and lives
in Connecticut.

Prisonhouse of Age

Something has to be said about age and ageism, which is so pervasive in
our culture, that we're held down, tied up, unable to move. I'm told I
look good for my age; that I play like a much younger person. In a
performance I hear that a dancer, who died at 68, was in the middle of the
end of her life. A friend says that his uncle dying at the age of 72, is
quite old. Grandfathers and grandmothers on tv always look to retirement
and playing with the kids. Television ads are increasingly aimed towards
drugging us, those over 60 say, because of a variety of ailments we don't
have. We're frightened of falling and not getting up. We're no longer
mid-career artists, but a dying generation. We're waiting for the end.
Friends say that now we're waiting for us to die off, that every day
brings news of new deaths and again this isn't true. The rhetoric is
hurtful and isn't meant to be hurtful. The rhetoric is made out of bits
and pieces of the 'natural' progression from birth to death. We're the
AARP generation. We're the baby boomers are are demanding to suck social
welfare dry. We don't do anything. We're not worth listening to. We're
hippies and repeat the 60s. We just love listening to 60s music which
formed us. We're part of the social welfare state. Some of us who fought
in Vietnam are an embarrassment. Some of us who didn't are an
embarrassment. On tv we're told that 'all we have is our stories.'

If this happened to anyone at any age, the result would be unbearable.
We're not taken seriously. We're all waiting for us to pass away. We have
to prove ourselves repeatedly. We're the result of hidden prejudice. We're
on the way to dementia. We're on the way to Alzheimer's. We're told our
short-term memory isn't what it used to be. In the most well-meaning areas
of popular culture, we're forgetful. Our bones are weak and ready to
fracture. We have to exercise more. Our family has to be everything. We're
not eligible for grants and for jobs. We're eligible to die and the sooner
we do that, the less the embarrassment. In fact embarrassment is the key
to everything; we embarrass others. If we're sexual it's a joke. If we
remarry it's a joke. If we refuse our assigned place in the family it's a
joke.

I first ran into ageism at the age of 30, applying for a job as editor of
an art mag in Los Angeles. I've always been sensitive to it because I've
always been told I look and act 'younger than my age.' Now the violence of
age, an assigned number, a number we can't do anything about - almost but
not quite like the color of our skin - is foregrounded. I get turned down
for jobs because of it, illegal but of course there are always ways around
it.

My own feeling? If I can't do something now, just as if I couldn't do
something at 20, then so be it; I don't belong where doing that thing is
impossible. But otherwise, leave me alone, judge me on what I make, what I
say, and leave goddamn age out of it. Don't call me a generation and don't
tell me my best days are behind me. Don't tell me I'm in my golden years.

This may all seem minor, idiotic, to you. You have no idea, at least in
the US, how pervasive this is. There are pockets of resistance - Eyebeam
for example, where I was resident until a week or two ago, is a healthy
exception. But almost everywhere, the codes are in place, they're
suffocating. I'm offered seats on the subway - because of age, not because
I need them. People condescent, smile at me, since apparently I'm no
longer sexual, have no desires, know my place. I'm told I'm a child again,
that the elderly are child-like. I'm told I'm living on borrowed time. I'm
told there's not much time left. I'm told I should be grateful. I'm told I
have a loving family. I'm told my grandchildren are my future. I'm told my
children are my future. I'm told I have no future.

I'm told about generations, that I'm of this or that generation, that it's
now the turn of a new generation. I'm told what our generation thinks and
I can't recognize that. I'm told repeatedly that we were born before the
digital age, that we think differently. The fact this isn't true, none of
this is true, with people I know and I'm sure millions of people in this
country, is irrelevant. I'm lectured _to._ I'm talked _to._ I'm taken out
of the realm of instrumental thinking, consigned to a real which is a
total mirage, told to act my age and behave myself. People don't tell me
to retire, but they assume I'm headed that way. My theoretical work is
assumed dated, somewhere back probably with existentialism or Bateson. My
mind is supposedly elderly. Am I repeating myself? Did I forget something
here? Should I send a birthday gift? Should I ask a grandson or daughter
to drive for me, since I'm constantly running off the road? Should I start
preparing for the end? Should I become a consumer of culture, preferably
old tv shows and books, instead of a producer? It's remarkable how well I
look for my age! It's remarkable I haven't had any major medical problems
yet, but wait, they're just around the corner. Do I have enough money to
do nothing? Should I do nothing? Should I worry about my IRA?

I don't expect this to change, not even with radicalism on the rise among
people I know. But I do want to say this - that when you see someone, at
any age, turning towards senility or depression, you might ask yourself
what happened to that person, how is that person perceived - by his or her
family or friends, by others in the community, by granting organizations
or hiring committees. You might look at studies of enforced helplessness,
you might think for a moment how age, like race, manifests itself today -
age more violently than ever, since we're assumed to be non-productive,
eating away at the very foundations of civil digital society, of
whatever's left of the commons, of the fabric of the sentient city.

What I'm talking about is being called a 'geezer' or 'old geezer' or 'old
man' with all the nastiness that implies. This isn't true of everyone, of
course, but it's miserable enough, that it's true across the board. In the
culture industry, such as it is, you either become blue-chip and/or elder-
statesman or woman, or you sink into oblivion. If I go into a gallery, I'm
immediately sized up in a certain way that parallels the not-so-subtle
hatreds against race in the 1930s. I recognize the violence of that
parallel itself, but there's no other way to describe it. Lyotard called
this kind of situation the differend, and there's been writing on and off
about the stigma that's applicable. We carry a sign on our foreheads, a
sign not of our own making or choosing, but one imposed on us culturally.
Whatever we do or accomplish is under or within the sign. Whatever we say
is already signed, assigned.

I'm sick of this, and this rant, so to speak, is nothing more than an
expression of that sickness. And I'm well aware that nothing will be done
about it, although things _can_ be done about it. I'm tired of ageist
remarks being 'let slip' accompanied by apologies. We have no slogans like
"we're here and we're queer." We're speechless. We're kept speechless.
We're irrelevant, just as this protest is irrelevant.

In the _foreground_ there are all the inadvertent and well-meaning
comments, advertising, stereotypes in the media. In the _background_ there
are concrete decisions being made against us, but 'benevolently' for us.
In the background, Foucauldian power violates the commons. In the back-
ground, the Occupiers don't see age as a problem. In the background,
they're waiting for our deaths, forgetfulnesses, incapacities, hostels -
they're waiting for our silencing. The _they_ is the Heideggarian They,
the They of doxa, the They of the obdurate, idiotic inert. The they is
always well-meaning; the They knows what's best for us.

On and on: This would kill _anyone,_ this misreading, misrecognition,
deprivation, fun-house mirror. Some people can ignore it altogether, most
of us can't. We live within a social order of _continuous violation._ And
there's no way out.

- Alan

er literary aims with the Cubist painters;=0Afeminists who read her work as=
 a challenge to patriarchal language; and critics=0Awho examined Stein=E2=
=80=99s writing as a more general subversion of the process of=0Asignificat=
ion. In the 1990s, Stein criticism turned its focus to how her=0Awriting en=
gages issues of American national and/or cultural identity. As Lisa=0ARuddi=
ck observes, =E2=80=9Cwork in a cultural studies mode. . . moved the conver=
sation=0Aabout Stein=E2=80=99s artistic innovations beyond a sense of her o=
ffering a challenge=0Ato patriarchy in the abstract=E2=80=9D and into =E2=
=80=9Clarger cultural fields=E2=80=94fields defined=0Aby discourses of race=

=A0=0AMost recently, Stein=0Athe celebrity has re-emerged. Her life has aga=
in become the focus of scholarly=0Ainquiry in articles, books and exhibits:=

or, and Stein the visual icon. Popular interest=0Ain Stein has of late gene=
rated The Steins=0ACollect museum exhibit, a children=E2=80=99s book celebr=
ating her writing, a novel=0Atold from the perspective of Stein and Toklas=
=E2=80=99s Vietnamese cook, and Stein as a=0Acharacter in the Woody Allen f=
ilm Midnight=0Ain Paris. In addition, Seeing=0AGertrude Stein, the companio=

sual portrait of Stein, rendering =E2=80=9Ca richly complex=0Awoman=E2=80=
=9D whose =E2=80=9Ccontradictions ran deep=E2=80=9D (7). No doubt, these re=
cent=0Aexaminations enrich and complicate our understanding of Stein and of=
 how we=0Amight read her work, as she implores=0Aus to do. =0A=C2=A0=0AHere=
, in=0Aresponse to these current trends, we seek to assemble a collection o=
f essays that=0Aturns the lens back on Stein=E2=80=99s writing, in and acro=
ss all genres in which she=0Awrote. We are interested in scholarly essays t=
hat take Stein=E2=80=99s primary works as=0Atheir core analytical focus. We=
 do not suggest jettisoning contextual=0Aapproaches, but we do encourage in=
quiry into the writing itself, in all its=0Ahistorical trajectories and dis=
cursive iterations. Essays might ask what it is=0Awe learn from the tension=
s produced in Stein=E2=80=99s work in order to expand fields=0Aof inquiry a=

Dear friends and colleagues,

I will be reading at the Poetry Project on Wednesday, March 28^th at 8
PM from /This Constellation Is A Name: Collected Poems 1965-2010/ just
published by Nightboat

Books.

Some advance notice on /This Constellation Is A Name/:

"Full-throated praise for this remarkable accomplishment, a generous
tome of over a half century's life and astute consciousness in poetry.
Michael Heller is one of our best poets and thinkers who has carried
Oppen's dictum that poetry embodies "precise information on existence"
forward. His erudition and scope astound: Jewish mysticism finds company
with Baudelaire and TibetHis modes are various and true, and constellate
fully realized an experimental/ philosophical/profound Lyric. ---Anne
Waldman


"To conceive otherwise," says Michael Heller, is the poet's essential
task, to which he has apprenticed himself for nearly fifty years. No
matter if the poem is brief or extended, the line long or short, the
setting Manhattan or the Colorado Rockies, a lost Bialystok or an
imagined Tibet---what arises from the page is an action of mind, an
asking, questing trajectory, tracked with uncanny surety by movement of
the poetic line. This is no language-locked adventure, but an
impassioned, ethical /listening/ to the mind---and the world---at work
in words. ---Susan Tichy

Reading with me will be Kristin Prevallet the author of /I, Afterlife:An
Essay/ and other volumes.

The Poetry Project is located in St. Mark's Church at the corner of 2^nd
Avenue and East Tenth Street in Manhattan (call 212-674-0910 for more
information).

Apropos of Gertrude in Woody Allen's new movie "Midnight In Paris" did
anyone catch the line spoken by the Hemingway character saying to the
writer protagonist: "Don't give your manuscript to a writer. If it's good
I'll hate it because I'm envious. If it's bad I'll hate it because it's
bad. You should give it to Gertrude Stein."

The shocking not-so-sub sub-text is that Stein was not a writer. A
consummate reader perhaps, but (at least in Hemingway's mind, if not Woody
Allen's) not a writer. Pretty bizarre for me--since I grew up loving Stein
and denigrating Hemingway.

Dear all,
A student asked if I knew of any intersex or transgender poets and I
must confess I didn't have any names at my fingertips.
Can anyone out there post (or back-channel) names that come to mind?
Thanks in advance.

"Material Matters: Textual Intersections Between the Avant-Garde and the

Gregory Betts
420 Capen, The Poetry Collection, University at Buffalo

Gregory Betts is the author of *Avant-Garde Canadian Literature: The Early
Manifestations *(University of Toronto Press, 2012, *in press*). He has
edited four books of early Canadian experimental writing, each of which
emerged from extensive unpublished materials discovered in archives across
Canada. He is also an experimental poet and has published five books of
poetry. His 2009 book *The Others Raisd in Me* (Pedlar Press) extracts 150
new poems from Shakespeare=92s Sonnet 150 through the =93plunderverse=94 me=
thod.
He is an Associate Professor of English at Brock University in St.
Catharines, Ontario, where he also serves as the Director of the Centre for
Canadian Studies.


*Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series dedicates itself to the study of
poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The lectures
inthis series draw on materials
in The Poetry Collection, at SUNY Buffalo in order to explore
community/discourse formations, the status of ephemera and the making of
genre, the conditions of literary production, transatlantic
cross-pollinations in and between specific magazines, the careers of poets,
the role of book art, and how the little magazine functions in the making
of the avant-garde.*

Javant Biarujia=92s latest collection, =93Resinations=94, takes the reader =
on a
roller-coaster ride through, mostly, Western (pop) art, culture and
politics, from Kant to Dorothy Lamour, the Inquisition to =93Leave It to

neologism, is echoic of resonations =97 every pun is intended in this
collection =97 as well as resignation, at once an Eastern concept and a
Western reality for many an employee. In sixty-four numerologically

(=93Labdanum=94), he mirrors the world back at us, always startling,

it is always rich, witty and meaningful, what Charles Bernstein has called
=93quixotically alluring,=94 and Gig Ryan, =93fun and mock bawdiness.=94 Or=

Biarujia himself says: =93through levity to levitation.=94

=93This is a poetry that leads the reader not only in and down but also,
through re-sounding, across, crossing boundaries, making unthought of
connections, exploring the fertile errata of translation. Biarujia sends
out sounds that skip from language to language in a series of
transformations/ interactions=94 =97 *Geraldine McKenzie*

   powerful suggestion of travel, of journeys that have merged into a
   single journey. There is evidence of arrival and departure, but the
   main sense is of transit, of looking back on what has been left, or
   forward to what is to come. The photographs are rarely in the moment.

POETRY

   Five Poems
   Frederick Seidel
   from =E2=80=9CNight=E2=80=9D

   The city sleeps with the lights on.
   The insomniac wants it to be morning.
   The quadruple amputee asks the night nurse what time it is.
   The woman is asking for her mother,
   But the mother is exhausted and asleep and long since dead.
   The nun screams to stop the charging rhino
   And sits bolt upright in bed
   Attached to a catheter.

          <http://www.henryart.org/calendar?date=2012-03-31>, 2:00 - 3:30 PM


          Henry Auditorium of the Henry Art Gallery in Seattle

http://www.henryart.org/events/show/573

A performance by Gary Hill & George Quasha for multiple cameras,
microphones, video projectors, computers, electronic drums (Roland
Octapad), Serge Modular, assorted effect boxes, Kinect, software
programs Max/MSP/jitter, Process and others all manifesting towards
self-reorienting language/sounds/rhythms/images ("axials"), paper and
acrylics, and human bodies on the verge.

/What are glossodelia?/ To answer this question beyond the literal
meaning of the word---"revealing tongues"---Gary Hill and George Quasha
enter into a state of co-performative inquiry by way of what they use
for language. This includes just about anything that can be generated in
real (and hyperreal) time, such as sound, image, word, gesture, and a
range of semi-definable electronic phenomena ("electronic linguistics").
What they generate through various instruments ("psychotropic languaging
vehicles") becomes a field of strange attractors ("dynamical lingualia")
with a pull toward possible language realities ("lingualities"). They
have called it "a pulsational conversation with stepped-up intensity in
which Real Time is invited to show its other side."

Come early, stay late! Our wonderful exhibition guides will be offering
free guided tours of /glossodelic attractors/
<http://henryart.org/exhibitions/show/1166> before and after the
program. Tours will meet in the south gallery at 1pm and 4pm.

and rural part of the unglaciated Driftless area of southwest
Wisconsin. Choosing to focus on creating wilderness and abundance
surrounded by the perfect setting for limitless imagination his course
of action includes demonstrating alternatives to inbred aesthetics,
delighting in the play of DIY culture, and making art and writing that
is both anarchic and noisy. aND is the author of numerous books, many
available via Xexoxial Editions. After many years working in the
realms of digital poetry and video, he has surrendered his role as
author and focused exclusively on interactions that allow the author
to be reconfigured by the mysteries of the collaborative process,
including books with Maria Damon, Sheila Murphy and Geof Huth. Anyone
wanting to tap into his stream can find him on Facebook or at Xexoxial
Editions

aware of: "The Marrow's Telling: Words in Motion"

Perhaps of interest to a few folks:

mIEKAL aND about his Collaboration Workshop::
.
Long Poem Mysteriously Appears in the Sumptuous Mist of Collaboration

You heard somewhere that there will be a workshop of live spontaneous
collaboration with a little-known post-avant-farmer poet from the
outskirts of nowhere and come to the gathering having no expectations
of what collaboration could possibly mean or how the author as sole
intellect is surrendered to the greater multi-lingual spirit of sound
and language and typography dancing unrestrained into the night. Once
there, with the curious and inspired contributions of all gathered, a
mysterious linguistic object arises as the time passes and the
interactions overcome the barriers to unleashing creativity. BRING
laptops, pencils, typewriters, iPhones, whatever communication device
rocks your world.

Since the year 1999, mIEKAL aND has abandoned the world of the Author
in exchange for the exciting and glamorous life of collaborations
which dissolve the boundaries between identity, gender and the
mysterious abstractions of the afterlife of thought.

This novel isn't suitable for you. The story is romantic and terrifying.
Too gloomy. You should read something delightful.

Dear all,
A student asked if I knew of any intersex or transgender poets and I must confess I didn't have any names at my fingertips.
Can anyone out there post (or back-channel) names that come to mind?
Thanks in advance.

My chapbook, THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER, was recently published in print and =
online as part of the Dusie collective:

http://www.dusie.org/RUBY%20The%20Star%20Spangled%20Banner.pdf



The 14-poem chapbook is a selection from a longer unpublished book. Every p=
oem uses the 81 words of the national anthem.



Thanks to Susana Gardner and the other Dusie contributors,

Michael Ruby



Here are two poems from the chapbook that might interest readers of America=
n poetry:



My Favorite Things in T.S. Eliot



O Rachel n=E9e Rabinovitch say the latest Pole can the thousand sordid imag=
es you

in the juvescence of the year see the eternal Footman

By talking of Michelangelo the dead tree gives no shelter dawn's what might=

What Shantih so in my beginning proudly the door we never opened we among

velleities hailed never and always

At shored against my ruins the Gentile or Jew twilight's death had undone s=

Whose Sir Ferdinand Klein broad spawned in some estaminet in Antwerp stripe=
s

re

Through the future futureless the quick now, here perilous not knowing what=
 to

feel night his laughter was submarine

O'er disturb the universe the neither living nor dead ramparts to prepare a=
 face we

infinitely suffering thing watched in demotic French

Were in the last desert so the lean solicitor gallantly a golden grin strea=
ming a

lusterless protrusive eye



And Chicago Semite Viennese the phthisic hand rocket's Unreal City red a

thousand furnished rooms glare time for you

The hundred visions and revisions bombs an age of prudence bursting I am no

prophet in I have lost my passion air that is not it

Gave an overwhelming question proof them pills I took through an old crab w=
ith

barnacles the with a pained surprise night hope for the wrong thing

That in a rented house our the pain of living flag voices singing in our ea=
rs was the

eternal enemy still there are no eyes here there the rats are underneath



O the Jew is underneath say with murderous paws does a crowd of twisted thi=
ngs

that the tumid river star the beneficent spider spangled sempiternal though

sodden banner the cruellest month yet the old miasmal mist wave HURRY

UP PLEASE ITS TIME

O'er her friendly bust the polyphiloprogenitive land smell of steaks of mem=
ory and

desire the Hieronymo's mad againe free if you came this way

And after such knowledge the I Tiresias home bowing among the Titians of ea=
ch in

his prison the Jew squats brave who clipped the lion's wings

My Favorite Things in Allen Ginsberg



O Naomi Ginsberg say Eliot probably an ignu can masturbating in his jeep yo=
u the

Flower burning in the Day see the penis of billionaires

By the same old universe the green leaf shaped like a human heart dawn's wa=
iting

Babylonian possible world

What Van Gogh's Ear on the currency so imbecilic canned voice of eternity

proudly Denver! Denver! we'll return we hundreds of suitcases full of

tragedy hailed in a minor universe

At death comes before life the driving drunk on boulevards twilight's every=
 leaf

has fallen before last money from an impossible saintly roll gleaming

angelheaded hipsters



Whose Newark's bleak furnished room broad Greystone's foetid halls stripes =
time

with all its falling leaves and fat women in strapless silk bright head & t=
ail

of the universe stars the old hotel of the world

Through archetype degenerate the radio screams for money perilous the skin

trembles in happiness night flying like birds into Time

O'er them bad Russians the actual visions & actual prisons ramparts dreamy

strange murderer we what's left over from perfection watched fishqueen

And the universe is a graveyard the my bus will arrive as foretold rocket's=
 sphinx

We had another version of this trans poets conversation on Maria's facebook
page of course, but I'll say it once again here:

TC Tolbert and I are editing a forthcoming Anthology of Trans and
Genderqueer Poetry (titled forthcoming) which includes 50 different poets
and which we hope will be out by late fall 2012. I'm really excited about
the book and from the response it sounds like a lot of people may want to
do course adoptions for it.

For more information on the book, visit
http://transanthology.com

For info on TC you can visit http://tctolbert.com

And for more information on EOAGH Books in general, you can visit
http://eoagh.com/?page_id=22

Thanks to Tod for the really sweet shout-out about my first book Since I
Moved In, which I never really publicized properly because I was running
around frantically curating 4 simultaneous reading series for several
years. For anyone who is interested, I can also mail you a copy of my
newest chapbook Violet Speech, which is published by 2nd Avenue Poetry.

ALPHA DONUT by Matvei Yankelevich

Cover by Nora Griffin     93 pages     $16

ISBN 978-0-935992-29-8

"I feel incredibly close to this book because, in picturing a life
lived through writing, it never abdicates the knot of ambivalence &
ecstasy such a life necessarily entails. The idea that liking things
is somehow equivalent to knowing them, is in every way refuted by the
humor, inquiry, & love this book manifests over & over. While the
language is clear, its clarity is turned to sing through something
elementally illegible foundering in the depths of our feeling--"This
text is written on buttons / so tightly sewn / to each other that no
one / can read it." That's really why I feel so bonded to his book, &
why now I can't imagine life without it." Dana Ward

"Reading Yankelevich's poems, we get to know where and how he lives,
and how the library of all the poetry that truly matters in this
world, located in his awareness, affects those facts of existence."
Anselm Hollo

"...It makes me happy to be alive. Because every poem is a surprise--
the kind of poignancy that hits close to home, and the kind of sarcasm
that heals." Kristin Prevallet

"ALPHA DONUT kept me up all night with its hardboiled deep-cover
tenderness. Yankelevich writes the driest bar poems west of the Great
Depression and his rolls in the hay with various memes fatales may end
up double-proving that no vacuum is perfect, least of all New York in
the aughts. His poem "The Tree of Heaven Grows Downward" will outlive
the sinews of this paperback." Julien Poirier

"ALPHA DONUT is a book of love poems in which the beloved is language--
its stubborn resistances and sweet objecthood, its uncomfortable
marriages to park bench and cigarette and city." Cathy Wagner


Born in Moscow, USSR, in 1973, Matvei Yankelevich is the author of
Boris by the Sea (Octopus Books) and several chapbooks: Writing in the
Margin (Loudmouth Collective), The Present Work (Palm Press), The
Nature Poetry of Matvei Yankelevich (Knock-Off), and Bending at the
Elbow (Minutes Books). He edited and translated Today I Wrote Nothing:
The Selected Writings of Daniil Kharms (Ardis/Overlook). He has taught
at the Russian Department of Hunter College, Columbia University
School of the Arts Writing Division, and the Milton Avery Graduate
School of the Arts at Bard College. He is a member of the volunteer
editorial collective of Ugly Duckling Presse, a nonprofit publisher
based in Brooklyn, New York.

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CSnowlines=E2=80=9D by Jack A=
lun
Description:
"Snowlines" is, at once, a poem and a series of poems in which perception a=
nd memory stutter to the edge of oblivion. Alun employs a taut, sparse but =
evocative style to direct the reader through a network of images and ideas =
into interiors of personal understanding. The variety of themes covered, in=
cluding love, language and the ephemeral, incorporate as recurring echo int=
o the bleakness of the landscape.

An OK Organ Man

    polonius

    give thy furrows no fatigue
    nor any charming king his march
    be thou clever, but by no means five feet high
    the blows thou hast, and their remonstrance tried
    compact them to thy palm with  venison
    but do not dew thy dog with common law
    for each malignant, unrepentant fish
    doth know: that every grief remains in common yet.
    give every woman's ear thy question voice
    beware the ambergrise, that it beware of thee
    take each mans acre of inclosed land
    reserve thy wild, uncultivated wastes
    costly thy nations as thy purse can buy
    but not expressed in quarrels, fancy, hums
    for oft it is delight proclaims the ban
    & the fleetest part of all's the bakers sweat.
    neither abundance nor a husband be.
    supply my defects: this is thy chief end
    and thou, my proper fee.

Hello again!

Apiary Magazine put up a little piece about my t-shirts:
http://apiarymagazine.com/concrete-poetry-is-always-in-style/

"Philly poet Paul Siegell has been featured in APIARY twice and has been
responsible for visual poetry hijinks ever since he had an unforgettable
summer fling with a mature Swiss lady named Helvetica.  I love his giddy
sense of word-nerd humor and the way his creations make me squint and thi=
nk
for a minute before I get the joke. He released his poetry t-shirt line j=
ust
in time for poetry month. Read on for how the tees came about and to bede=
ck
yourself in Philly poetry, if you so desire."  =96 Lillian, APIARY Managi=
ng Editor

A few new shirts have been added since my last post:
http://paulsiegell.spreadshirt.com/

Thanks again,
Paul

education using the limit case of art created in response to the Holocaust.
Her previous books and chapbooks include mouthpiece (Tsunami Editions,

TC Tolbert !

Thursday, April 5 at 7 PM
in Room 9206,
CUNY Graduate Center

What are the new poetics and the new manifestos? What do authors
actually do when they write, and what can be learned from their
investigations? This series of talks, titled in honor of Eve Kosofsky
Sedgwick, explores the relationship between queer writing/artmaking
process, pedagogy, and the manifesto.

Sarah Schulman is the author of 16 books, most recently THE
GENTRIFICATION OF THE MIND: Witness to a Lost Imagination (U of Cal
Press) and the forthcoming ISRAEL/PALESTINE AND THE QUEER
INTERNATIONAL, due in the Fall from Duke University Press. She is co-
director of the ACT UP Oral History Project, an archive that
revitalized interest in the history of AIDS activism and created a
cultural context for its representation. She is a Distinguished
Profess of the Humanities at CUNY, College of Staten Island.

TC Tolbert is a genderqueer, feminist poet and teacher committed to
social justice. Co-editor of the forthcoming Anthology of Trans and
Genderqueer Poetry, TC is also the author of a chapbook, territories
of folding, published by Kore Press and his book, Gephyromania, is
forthcoming from Ahsahta Press. He is the Assistant Director of Casa
Libre en la Solana and founder of Made for Flight.

writer, director, comedian and music producer. D=92Lo=92s work has been
published in various anthologies and academic journals, most recently:
Desi Rap: Hip Hop and South Asia America and Experiments in a Jazz
Aesthetic (co-edited by Sharon Bridgforth). D=92Lo is also the creator

From: steven tobin <steven@museumfire.com>

We're pleased to announce two new vinyl releases on the Fire Museum label!
The first one is Cauldron by Alan Sondheim, Helena Espvall & Azure Carter.
The other is Circle of Crosses by Dora Bleu, Tom Carter and Sam Shalabi.
These releases are domestically produced 140 gram vinyl, housed in an
offset printed cover with j-card style obi. These are split releases with
Tequila Sunrise Records. From the write ups:

Cauldron - Cauldron deals out a three of cups: Alan Sondheim, a pioneer of
mystical ear-tweak and sci-fi sonic ritual sound, chamber-improv gypsy
cellist Helena Espvall, and eco-trance singer Azure Carter? thrice to
thine and thrice to mine, and thrice again, to make up nine. Channeling
the ghosts of Opal Whiteley and Lou Harrison, Cauldron conjures the
scratch and shush of the Big Bang out of wood, wind and cat-gut. Whenever
you listen to it, this album is always over too soon, just like life. Fire
Museum and Tequila Sunrise Records deal out a two of pentacles: not to get
all ?Yankee Candle? here, but we only made 250 of these, so grab one
before they melt away like chemtrails in the sunset sky,

http://www.museumfire.com/cauldron.htm $24.98 North America/$34.98 Rest of
the world (includes postage).

Circle of Crosses - Fire Museum (39.955117?N 75.161240?W) and Tequila
Sunrise Records (39.969203?N 75.14505?W) present this gathering of
guitar-driven emanations, the first side leafy, lyrical and acoustic, the
second side an astringent application of electric gnarl. ?Circle of
Crosses? brings together folk pythia Dora Bleu (guitar and vocal) with
psych-improv wizards Sam Shalabi and Tom Carter (guitars and other
instruments). It links Tripoli (32?548N 13?119E) to Washington D.C
(38?5342.4N 77?0212.0W) and Houston (29?4546N 95?2259W), not to mention
Mile End (45?3130N 73?3500W) to Louvain-la-Neuve (50? 40 4 N, 4? 36 42 E).
Consider these songs map coordinates for safe-houses from das
?berw?ltigensein, a set of precise locales for ecstasy, atheist shrines,
or open spaces for reverie in the forgotten recesses of the planetary
connectome.

Over on the Women's Poetry listserv, I've found that it's heartening to hea=
r accounts of first encounters with Rich through her work. =A0My own came a=
s an undergrad when my then-teacher, Elaine Hedges, took us diving into the=
 wreck ... Hedges, who recovered and wrote the afterword to "The Yellow Wal=
lpaper," also brought Rich to read in Baltimore, a place she was fond of, i=
n a church near the sadly now-defunct 31st Street Feminist Bookstore, which=
 also sponsored her powerful reading. =A0I was too shy to do more than hove=
r nearby at the end, but certainly that reading compounded what I sensed of=
 her power and dedication to poetry, politics, and people. =A0=0A=0A=0A=0AS=
o much of what is gone now also points forward to what is going, what is un=
der fire via "austerity" cuts via economic downturns via a decline in incom=
e via the anti-intellectual strains ripping through headlines via the lazy =
need for convenience, etc. =A0Bookstores are ridding themselves of poetry a=
isles that aren't so lucrative, we're buying more and more online instead o=
f from places like Unnameable Books, and we hear very little about just wha=
t poets like Rich contributed to a social and political consciousness. =A0 =

Patrick--

Your review and your own work attached to the review are so engaging
that I have just ordered a copy of Meltzer's "When I was a Poet."  Could
not resist.  I had the privilege of hearing this wonderful poet read a
year or two ago in Buffalo.

Thanks for posting this.

Best,
Martha

Leap second festival 2012

Call for entries : Works lasting one second or less. The festival is also
interested in texts and essays.

The festival takes place on the leap second which occurs 30th June
2012 23:59:60 UTC.

Submission at festival website
http://noemata.net/leapsec/

The leap second festival is an open, free, distributed, international,
non-profit festival for art, technology and precarity coordinated on
the Internet. This is the first leap second festival. The festival marks
the leap second as deviation and glitch, a bug in the machinery of time,
and also a reality-check and celebration (glitz) of natural cycles and
physical reality, taking place at the moment when the ideal time we have
on our clocks is synchronized with the real time based on the rotation
of the earth.

The festival is open and free for anyone who wish to participate and
submit work. There are no prizes or fees involved. The festival is
documented afterwards.

The festival is open to all types of artistic expressions. Even though
the festival is coordinated and organized via the net the works
themselves don't have to be based, or available, on the net. The
festival is distributed in the sense that the works take place at a
certain time and not necessarily at a certain place. The website of the
festival will coordinate the works by organizing and listing, hosting,
exhibiting, running, and documenting each according to its needs.

The festival believes one second doesn't have to be an impossible
limitation, but maybe a creative limitation, whether or not the works
are realized as things, events or processes adapted to immediate human
perception, or as programs or code that are executed or exhibited. An
ordinary computer does a couple of billion things in the course of one
second. The leap second itself is defined as 9,192,631,770 cycles of a
cesium-133-atom. In the same way that the festival is partly conceptual
despite the physical base in earth rotation and time, the participating
works might revolve around ideas about time, virtuality, and
physicality, in addition to notions about science, machines, technology
and how they relate to natural and physical cycles. That said, there
might be other aspects involved, each own to his own, for example...

- The "formless"... The rejection of form and content and their
traditional game, in favour of horizontality, pulse, entropy, gestalt,
fleeting, and joke. The form is orderly enough - one second - but the
order is almost in the order of joke, and in the horizontality, pulse
and entropy of time - fleeting, virtual - as if to ask, did it really
happen, or what is it for something to happen, or to be?

- "one-off"... one-shot, a happening that occurs only once and is not
repeated --happening, natural event, occurrence, occurrent - an event
that happens, though with intended irregular repetition, an unstable
jiggle of the ball, keeping one eye on the ball, the blink of an eye.

- Precarity/Selfprecarization (turning on itself)...
=93So here we are in the present: at a time when the old ideas and
ideologies of the autonomy and freedom of the individual (especially
the individual as genius artist) plus specific aspects of post-1968
politics
have turned into hegemonic neoliberal modes of subjectivation.
Selfprecarization means saying yes to exploiting every aspect of
creativity and of life=85
The need to pursue other, less creative, precarious jobs to finance
one=92s own
cultural production is something one puts up with. This financing of
one=92s own creative output, enforced and yet opted for at the same time,
constantly supports and reproduces the very conditions in which one
suffers and which one at the same time wants to be part of. It is
perhaps because of this that creative workers, these voluntarily
precarized virtuosos, are subjects so easily exploited; they seem able
to
tolerate their living and working conditions with infinite patience
because of the belief in their own freedoms and autonomies, and
because of the fantasies of self-realization. In a neoliberal context,
they
are so exploitable that, now, it is no longer just the state that
presents
them as role models for new modes of living and working=94=85
From =93Critique of creativity=94 http://mayflybooks.org/?page_id=3D74

The leap second. Technology has made the leap second possible/necessary.
The leap second is no natural event as are mid-summer, equinox, etc.,
even if all of them is about an adjustment of a natural cycle. The leap
second doesn't have a cultural history before technology made it
possible to measure the physical rotation of the earth accurately enough
to intervene the ideal atomic time (the second defined by the
cesium-atom). The earth rotation appears to be more variable, and the
length of a day (a physical sun-day, a rotation of the earth around
itself) is slowly increasing over time. In that way the leap second is
introduced for the purpose of synchronizing the ideal time we have on
our clocks with the natural time in the universe.
The leap second festival, in this sense, can be seen as a new way of
celebrating natural cycles, aided by technology, but contrary to the
traditional celebration of eg. winter solstice or equinox, the leap
second is not regular, but more a measure of instability, almost
virtual, and having more character of being a bug in the machinery of
time, a technological glitch one is trying to patch, at the same time
that it is a reality-check and adjustment towards nature and physical
reality. It is also this bug that is being celebrated, of the
technological deviation from the natural cycle, and nature's deviation
from technology, and their realignment in the leap second.

The festival plans at taking place at each leap second in the years to
come. The leap second are irregular and are announced by The
International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) half a
year in advance.

If the international society decides to abolish the leap second in the
future because of problems updating and synchronizing all the world's
computers to real time, the festival plan to continue like other pagan
festivals around seasonal cycles. The next international debate about
the future of the leap second will take place in 2015.

Ordinarily the leap second is added to the universal time, but the
possibility exists that it's subtracted. In that case the festival will
receive works for deletion, and the submitted works disappear when the
festival takes place at the second that is being taken away.

That "Women and Honor" pamphlet was amazing -- I wonder how it would read
now. I also was very taken with "On Lies, Secrets, and Silence," and "Of
Woman Born."

Norton published a lovely pocket-sized edition of her essay, "Poetry and
Commitment," which was from a 2006 speech.

May her memory be for a blessing,
Carol
