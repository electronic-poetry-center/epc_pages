Interesting that people at this site seem more
familiar with Crosby than Rexroth.  Anyway, the site
has once more proved its value as a resource: i've
tried several places on the Internet to get my
answers, and got nowhere but here, and at a Rexroth
site whose webmaster didn't think Rexroth had composed
the poem I wanted to find out about.

In a sense, he was right, for I misdescribed it.
Actually, it doesn't consist of w-words, but of
v-words.  And it also has real words in it.  Its first
four lines are "vvvvvvvvvvvv," "vvvvvvvvvv,"
"vvvvvvvv" and "v," respectively; it fifth and last
line consists of six words with no spaces between
them.  Rexroth referred to it as a "cubist" poem, and
probably wrote it in the twenties or thirties.

Anyone know its title and/or date of publication?

--Bob G.

In Jerome Rothenberg's _Revolution of the Word_
there's a poem by Kenneth Rexroth entitled
"Fundamental Disagreement with Two Contemporaries"
(for Tristan Tzara & Andre Breton) which, in
the middle of the first section, has the lines:

"origin of vector

David--

This is an interesting idea.  Are the poems selected to represent the
poet's work in general? or to reprise (or anticipate) the poet's
selections for reading itself? Or for the poet to have available to sell?
 Or? Or? Or?

Could you tell us more? Perhaps at the Half?

Dear all:



After five years of work and negotiation I have managed to significantly
expand our department's internationally-know MFA in TV and Radio Production
(the first in the country) to accommodate students interested in undertaking
literary media/broadcasting projects.  Please distribute the following
message to any of your graduating students interested in a media MFA in New
York City.



Thanks,

Martin Spinelli

The Television and Radio Dept. at Brooklyn College of the City University
 of New York offers two graduate degree programs: the MFA in television
 production and the MS in Television and Radio.

 The MFA is a 49-credit, two-year intensive full-time course of study that
 allows students to participate in all facets of television production,
 including studio production, field production, radio production, multimedia
production
 and editing, all in state-of-the-art facilities.   A select group of
students is accepted into the program every two years in the fall semester.
The work-study program provides a stipend to students for fulfilling
assignments in staging and lighting, engineering, operations, and as

Hi Martha and All,

I'll be doing what i've always done with Boog, asking the author what it is
they want to have out in the world, talking with them about it, and getting the
work. Sometimes authors have work they want to get out in the world before it
feels even more removed to them than it already is. Other times they have a
fresh series of work they want out immediately. To me it's always been about
what the author wants, as long as the work is solid and they're open to being
edited, not just printed.

And, yes, they'll always be ready in time for the reading for the readers to be
able to sell. Normally I give the authors 10% of the print run, but since this
is a smaller print run I'll give them 20%, so 10 of the 50 copies.

anything else? it's an open book here at boog city.

best,
david

The poem in question is "Fundamental Disagreement With Two
Contemporaries" for Tristan Tzara and Andr=E9 Breton. It can be found on
pp. 83-89 of the Copper Canyon Collected, and comes from The Art of
Worldly Wisdom (1920-1930).

Cheers,

Variant horizons contained in Figure 4


This poem represents a mole
 and sustains plants in cold climates -

Where mammoths are easily induced
 to transform into world financial markets -

Fulfilling kinetic law through tributaries
 that collect and overwhelm
          stale management symposiums centered
      on interglacial characteristics
 of the fauna diagram
  and achieving a terraced staircase
                        by the early 1950s -

Along with several other examples
                   of poorly-phrased remains.

We have had quite a few  discussions on the--how do people juggle it
all and get writing done--thread on the WOM-PO poetry listserv
.....they are archived at
the WOM-PO Archives:

http://listserv.muohio.edu/archives/wom-po.html


A lot of them are under the thread "mom-po"......though of course it
is really "parent-po."

For years I was of the "you can always do it at 3 AM" school of
practice....a common tactic of many of my friends with small
children--.and I still find that sometimes I end up doing things in
the wee hours that I guess i must really want to get done.

One of the great things about writing poems for me is that the ones
that want to come figure out how to do it no matter how busy i am,
even if they have to wake me up to do it.....quite a few of my
favorites have been written by flashlight as well as the legendary
paper napkin ..of course, as somebody said, they seem to get strong
enough to do that well after years and years of daylight work.  Even
indirect work (criticism, editing, etc) seems to get plowed into the
soil and makes the actual poems better when they come...

Thanks for an intriguing question.

Annie

There's so much to say on this it threatens to elude vocabulary. A few
things can be tentatively said, over the chasms of speech removed: a) time
is not a constant, despite our reliance on clocks, calendars and conductor's
batons, it shrinks and expands in relation to what we are being-doing, so
that a very small amount of 'objective' time, say twenty minutes on the
watch, can fill with the creation of a poem to what is far more than twenty
minutes; b) the opposition of work and play is a false dichotomy, one which
'we', our societies, create through an enslavement to mutual misery which is
the source of all the wars and evils that beset us, work CAN be play, it can
be fun, but the drone mind of the soulless egosnared that so authoritarianly
dominates, domineers, turns what brings together into what makes apart. So
soul-aloned we make ourselves our own slaves.

And slavery, domination, ends speech.

Thank you for appreciating what I did on my job. As accomplishments, they
mean little to me except to say I did my job duties and more, and still
managed to make a writing life on company time. Many co-workers considered
me a slacker until they discovered I had done many things they hadn't.



Your article is fascinating. My thinking seems to be moving, or already
moved to some degree, in the direction you mention. My work certainly
appears to be the "epitome of non-productive labor.



Your "Postscript: the Sufism of the American Poem" explains the spiritual

Vernon,



This is a very impressive list. Still, I agree with you. Writing a good poem

is harder.



I have an essay, "Is Writing a Job, Is a Poem a Product," which can be

googled in the web if you write in my full name (Murat Nemet-Nejat). It
relates to

the question you are addressing in your response to David Kischenbaum.

I was quite happy to see the poets on this thread discussing work
habits.  I didn't think poets worked much, but was especially moved by
the Alice Croggin (spelling?) thing about the conditions in which she
managed to write a publishable novel.

I don't have anything to contribute here, but I was basically just
saying that I approved of everybody's work habits.

While we're on this topic, I wanted to go back to a similar conversation
regarding different cultures and their work habits or lack thereof.  I
saw on C-span while doing my aerobic bicycling an author from Harvard U.
talking about her new book

No Excuses: Closing the Racial Gap in Learning -- by Stephan and Abigail
Thernstrom.

Published by Simon & Schuster.

Abigail Thernstrom said that originally she thought that black learners
were being destroyed by a model of imperialism that discouraged them.
But the 70s did end, and she began to think that it wasn't this, but
something in black culture.  She said that some 80% of black children
have only one parent in their house.  In fact, 70% of black children
don't know who their father was.  Meanwhile, 88% of Asian students have
two parents living with them.  She thinks this is major.  She also said
that Asian students do not have higher IQs than blacks.  She doesn't
believe in this.  So the far right is all over her for this, screaming
she's another PC moron.  But she showed that she herself had taken
troubled black learners, and helped them, and one of them had become the
highest ranked high school mathematician in New York State.

I agree with her that this isn't a question of IQ.  I play sports with
black men all the time and they're wickedly brilliant at badminton,
basketball, and any other sport you can name.  But they tell me they
didn't have a single book in their houses when growing up.  Not one.
Imagine trying to learn a sport if your parents take no interest in it,
and you can't even get the equipment until you're twenty.  By then, it's
almost hopeless.  What are the answers?  Thernstrom thinks it's
something called Charter Schools.

Although only 4% of Americans are Asian American, 50% of the freshman
class this year at UC-Berkeley was Asian-American, Thernstrom said.
It's 15% at Harvard.  She thinks it's all about hard work.  Probably
so.  But you need a whole culture to support that work.

I'm guessing that most of the poets who have good work ethics in terms
of their writing/publishing efforts had at least one parent who took
special interest in their work, and maybe some other relatives, too, who
took an interest?  It's a culture, isn't it?  And here we're back to
talking about the role of parents in our lives, and the role of culture
(beliefs) that are supporting those parents.

essay on codework

like every other style, codework will disappear
as soon as it's born, an uncomfortable
miscarriage of the beginning and defensive
tactics of the classic information age. codework
attracts its share of quacks precisely because it
_is_ quackery - and doesn't one ever get tired of
monospacing? but there are more serious
considerations here.:there's no demand for it, no
pleasure in it, it's ult to construct. one would
think that problematic linkages between
programming and literatures would be fruitful,
but the programming is facile, at best
explanatory or obfuscating, and it's already
dated as soon as it's written. you'd have to be
the author to follow it. it's a style that ties
itself into a knot.:there is no transformation,
no knowledge. codework is a fraud. if i could
code, i'd never use the literature fakebook. my
programs are absurd, a few lines at the most. i
can hardly configure a program, much less create
one. codework is last vestige of tradition,
conservative in its subversion of code. it
manages to escape traditional aesthetic
categories in favor of the mess, or knotted
striations. it's dated as soon as it's
written.:the problem with codework:tying oneself
in knots

write first the fake or fraud through my like
every other style, codework will disappear as
soon as it's born, an uncomfortable afterbirth of
the beginning and defensive tactics of the
classic information age. codework attracts its
share of quacks precisely because it _is_
quackery - and doesn't one ever get tired of
monospacing? but there are more serious
considerations here.

        A Creation Song
        a poem, by Max Middle

=====

from "A Creation Song"

Flaccid apparatus laughed a lot leaving lucky a flotation device.
Lotta rolla hopscotch took a chance lurking out on the local side.
Best alone left on the pot to boil out the answer to a bulldozer;
the chalk oil choke throttle west fluttered a glance towards
oh, and off the ruffle, tottle or dawdle, shift, thanks mixing
new snow puffed louder peeled on the purchased affluence of
powdering a powerful person on the nose on the loose.
Because a pastime crimps a boiled plant to toughness
and it's off the fuffle, now that the stink is gone and the best
of the plant eaten or planted stuffed became the rest,
flaccid afloat and laughed a lot like a smile in the tackle berries
with alotta rolla hopscotch taking a chance leasing it to cherries.

Mime-version: 1.0

Good news about Boston poetry.

Tim Petersen is a brainy poet living in Somerville, one of the 'deckest'
places for poets to find themselves in metro Boston, because it's
overflowing with post collegiate synthesists and medians, cafe-dwellers, and
high-end style-critics who are not necessarily affiliated with Harvard. Tim
gave himself a birthday evening last Friday, inviting eight poets to read at
his apartment, inviting dozens of others to join in the cake- and
poetry-tasting. Readers were Xtina Strong, Brenda Iijima, Ruth Lepson, James
Cook, Mark Lamoureux, Sean Cole, Joel Sloman, and me. The readings were
brisk and filled with surprises. Turns out Mark, Sean and Xtina were child
poets together at Marlboro College, about ten years ago. Mark read some of
Sean's juvenilia -- hilarious -- and Sean, of course, returned the favor,
reading elaborate and highly credible romantic verse penned by Mark as an
undergraduate. Brenda, the only reader not based in Boston-Gloucester,
sounded as rock-bound as most of us, though, reading from her glorious and
unforgivingly complex first book, Around Sea, just released from O Books,
(Brenda grew up in western Mass., to some another outpost of Boston.) Ruth
read clipped and architecturally-toned entries from her dream records, which
will be published soon by Potes & Poets. James Cook, whom I had not heard
read before Friday's party, succeeded in taking up a number of formal
strands that I associate with Olson, Creeley and others who might be
identified with New England Projectivism: text as a field for argumentive
experiment; unironic word-play ("What are you / righting? // What is left.
Un- / orthodox tracts"); plain speech focused on communal history and
psychic hesitation. Joel Sloman read pieces he called unfinished, but more
often they sounded like parts of a whole (if still unfinished) suite. His
first poem titled "Troglodytes" pierced me with 20 seconds of sharp pain,
pain of the fun and necessary sort.

The fullest surprise, for me, was hearing Xtina Strong for the first time.
Xtina is a fabulous cyberpresence in blogdom, we know. She's a regular
reading-goer around Boston, as well, an attractive physical presence via her
various forms of encouragement and approval. And, look, wearing layers of
what you might first regard as eye-assaulting textures and colors, she is, I
have to admit, the best dresser in town. Xtina ad-libbed her reading in the
finest example of Wieners's force of influence. She read mostly from Sunday
Morning at the Grand, an anthology of local poets she edited and just
published under the aegis of Openmouth Press [contact chrisx@xtina.org].
This is a collection of work by regular attendees of Joe Torra's 'salon,'
held Sunday mornings at the Grand Coffee Shop in Union Square, Somerville.
The anthology includes pieces by Xtina, Michael Carr, Amanda Cook, James
Cook, Mark Lamoureux, Chris Rizzo, Joel Sloman, Tim Petersen, and Joe Torra.
The anthology itself is an important archive of what is being explored and
accomplished by a significant fraction of Boston avants. I'd like to stick
with Xtina's reading, however, because her first dipping into various texts
by most of the contributors played well with her own collaged texts that she
read after. Simply put, I interpret her reading as an occasion for an editor
to show her enthusiasm for the processes of compiling poetry, hers and
others'. Impossible to capture the density of her enthusiasm in snippets,
but here's a sample from "Blue Perspective."

I think the family has to value education if its children are going to value
it. In my former life, part of my field monitoring involved inspecting
apartments of people on subsidized housing programs. I was amazed at the
number of children who would be home on a school day, no sign of illness or
school vacation to justify it. These situations occurred enough times to
make me think I was encountering behavioral patterns, not isolated
incidents. I don't think all that many kids really like school, so if your
parents don't insist that you go, care about your grades and help you with
your homework, you're not likely to be interested in school. In college I
learned that the home environment can shape much of what we call
intelligence. A stable family certainly helps; my own grades dropped when my
parents divorced and my mother didn't have time to help me with a homework
problem because she was too tired from her job and the housework she and my
father used to do together. This isn't a racial issue. It also happens in
white families that are broken or don't value education. Rural Connecticut,
as an example, used to have a lot of 8th grade dropouts. Usually they worked
on the farms. I suspect, from what I've written, that they still drop out.
But I have no idea where they work.

LooK:   A Contest!


For reasons that will be explained at some later point, the Factory
School Engineering Department needs to modify an audio file currently
stored and accessed at the http://factoryschool.org site. The terms of
the modification of the audio file (actually it is several audio files)
is quite simple. While the name of the file will stay the same, the
contents of this file are to be swapped out. Replacing the poetry audio
currently comprising the file/s will be some other audio content.
Rather than hearing a poem, the listener would instead hear something
else. A John Dean ad? Move on?  Move off--forget it. Lets get creative.
The contribution should be a "monologue" composed of a minute or two
(page or two??) of "readable text" since it is to be performed (and
recorded for web-based audio play back) by one of three virtual
performers (readers), Agnes, Bruce and Victoria. It can be longer, but
don't assume that the listener will make it past the first minute or
two.  (Your entrance is everything!)

I will not answer further questions, but here are some hints.

Winning entries will be judged on their dramatic quality; poetic flair,
while good, is not a must.
Winning entires will be judged on their ability to cause discomfort in
the listener.

Listener or eventual audience: unassuming college students from one
particular campus in the United States. Don't worry, if you're reading
this, it's not your campus! The name of the files cannot, therefore, be
divulged.

Winners will receive free Factory School, Meow Press and PaperBrain
Press products.

I am set no mail, so please contact me directly to enter the contest.


Sincerely,

But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Re: Kirby Olson and Vernon Frazier's recent posts

Hmmmm, where to begin?

The who I am is more than the what home life circumstances under which I =
was reared created, although, to be sure, that environment assisted in =
both adding to and subtracting from characteristics that make up the =
total me I am today.   =20

I grew up in a home that had no books; my parents were uneducated =
laborers, children of immigrant laborers who too were uneducated, =
unskilled peasant farmers from eastern European countries, slaves of the =
Czar. =20

My father completed the 9th grade in the public schools in his =
Pennsylvania village; my mother completed the 4th grade in her public =
school system outside of Wilkes-Barre. =20

In 1929, both folks who at this time didn't know each other, moved with =
their families to Binghamton because Binghamton factories offered jobs.  =
Those factory jobs meant people could escape having to work in the coal =
fields or the coal yards, or worse, the coal mines. =20

My parents' marriage was a mistake; dad and his family attended the =
Greek Orthodox church of St. Michael's on Clinton St. in Binghamton.  =
Mom, and her mother were baptized in the Roman Catholic church.  Worse, =
both families were run by control-freak females who gave no quarter to =
the enemy and who disliked each other immensely, one calling herself =
Slovak, the other Ukranian, both indeed pig-headed religio-nationalistic =
idiots whom I lovingly called "Grandma."  =20

At his mother's urging, Dad enrolled me in kindergarten in the public =
school system...Daniel S. Dickenson, I think the school was called. =20

Mother's mother directed that I be enrolled in a more saintly program.  =
At the end of the school year, Mom enrolled me in the Roman church's =
parochial school, St. Cyril and Methodist on Clinton St.  I was accepted =
into the school and returned to kindergarten; "...to better ground the =
boy in the church's teachings..."  is the way the repeat of the school =
year was explained to me. =20

I remained enrolled in the Roman Catholic school, despite objections =
from dad's side of the family. =20

I did no reading outside of school during my primary years, nor did the =
nuns in the parochial school during my years require outside reading.  =
Most of what we read were text book items or chapters in the catechism =
texts. =20

I graduated from the 8th grade program at Sacred Heart of Jesus School =
in Irvington, N.J. and enrolled in the public school system to attend =
high school. =20

It was there I learned to enjoy reading.  A ninth grade English teacher, =
Mrs. Loll, read to the class from materials she brought in to augment =
the textbooks we were required to study.  She read poetry!  And she =
required all students to read and report on books of their own choosing. =
Those were such important words to me then: "...books of your own =
choosing."   I credit Mrs. Loll, now deceased, with having started me =
down the path to my intellectual destruction...she made  me a reader. =20

I read; I read more; I continued to read, much to the distraction of my =
studies.=20

I was a horrible student!  I managed to graduate but not in the upper =
half of my class. =20

Strangely enough, at the time of my H.S. graduation, I had read every =
book in the H.S. library written by Somerset Maugham, by Jane Austen, by =
scores of others,and by William Shakespeare (by the way, if memory =
serves there were only three Shakespearean pieces, Julius Caesar, Romeo =
and Juliette, and King Lear in the school's library).  I invaded the =
public library and found there quite by accident a work by a chap named =
John Milton; I started with Samson and by the time I left N.J. I had =
read Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained and a small volume of the major =
poems.  And I stumbled across a volume by Louis Untermeyer (SP?) that =
just captivated me.  In my senior year at H.S. I bought my own =
subscription to the volumes of the world's greatest literature, I think =
it was a Franklin Mint program, but I honestly don't remember that.  I =
actually read the works when they arrived.  =20

I came from a home where there were no books and in which the parents =
expressed no interest in education.  My parents never encouraged =
education, neither did they discourage it...emphasis was on working and =
earning a living, not on getting an education. =20

Strangely enough, I took a degree, became a teacher and married a woman =
who became a teacher (also a secondary school English teacher).  We had =
books all over the house, and we spent years fostering our children.  We =
were active in their education; we worked with their teachers, and we =
encouraged the children to continue on with their education and attend a =
university or at least a J.C.   =20

Yet, none of the three children holds a degree.  None continued on with =
his or her education after high school.  And none are readers in the =
sense that they read for the pure enjoyment of reading. =20

I did ask my daughter once (actually step-daughter) why she didn't go on =
to school after she graduated...she did study for a year in =
Scotland...and she said two things I thought most telling: 1. she didn't =
feel she ever learned anything in School.  2. She felt school seemed to =
cater more to the students who did what they were told, ignoring =
students who screwed up trying to learn by thinking for themselves. =20

Interestingly enough, both her children are university students, and one =
of them has chosen education as her future career. =20

I know all of this has not a damn thing to do with the absence of =
fathers in the homes of African-American households, but I do think it =
bears on the point that perhaps the conclusions drawn by the authors of  =
No Excuses, Closing the Racial Gap in Learning, are missing the point of =
the importance of individual effort, motivation and preferences. =20

Perhaps we are nothing more and nothing less than what we choose to make =
of ourselves despite difficulty and environmental circumstances...but =
then, that's just a thought, certainly not an axiom to form the basis =
for a graduate thesis.  And of course the idea removes the concept of =
"victim of...whatever" from the argument because it make us all only =
victims of our own failings.  Can that really be? =20

  Subject: Re: work/play habits


  I was quite happy to see the poets on this thread discussing work
  habits.  I didn't think poets worked much, but was especially moved by
  the Alice Croggin (spelling?) thing about the conditions in which she
  managed to write a publishable novel.

  I don't have anything to contribute here, but I was basically just
  saying that I approved of everybody's work habits.

  While we're on this topic, I wanted to go back to a similar =
conversation
  regarding different cultures and their work habits or lack thereof.  I
  saw on C-span while doing my aerobic bicycling an author from Harvard =
U.
  talking about her new book

  No Excuses: Closing the Racial Gap in Learning -- by Stephan and =
Abigail
  Thernstrom.

  Published by Simon & Schuster.

  Abigail Thernstrom said that originally she thought that black =
learners
  were being destroyed by a model of imperialism that discouraged them.
  But the 70s did end, and she began to think that it wasn't this, but
  something in black culture.  She said that some 80% of black children
  have only one parent in their house.  In fact, 70% of black children
  don't know who their father was.  Meanwhile, 88% of Asian students =
have
  two parents living with them.  She thinks this is major.  She also =
said
  that Asian students do not have higher IQs than blacks.  She doesn't
  believe in this.  So the far right is all over her for this, screaming
  she's another PC moron.  But she showed that she herself had taken
  troubled black learners, and helped them, and one of them had become =
the
  highest ranked high school mathematician in New York State.

  I agree with her that this isn't a question of IQ.  I play sports with
  black men all the time and they're wickedly brilliant at badminton,
  basketball, and any other sport you can name.  But they tell me they
  didn't have a single book in their houses when growing up.  Not one.
  Imagine trying to learn a sport if your parents take no interest in =
it,
  and you can't even get the equipment until you're twenty.  By then, =
it's
  almost hopeless.  What are the answers?  Thernstrom thinks it's
  something called Charter Schools.

  Although only 4% of Americans are Asian American, 50% of the freshman
  class this year at UC-Berkeley was Asian-American, Thernstrom said.
  It's 15% at Harvard.  She thinks it's all about hard work.  Probably
  so.  But you need a whole culture to support that work.

  I'm guessing that most of the poets who have good work ethics in terms
  of their writing/publishing efforts had at least one parent who took
  special interest in their work, and maybe some other relatives, too, =
who
  took an interest?  It's a culture, isn't it?  And here we're back to
  talking about the role of parents in our lives, and the role of =
culture
  (beliefs) that are supporting those parents.

I doubt that it can be, Alex. A case of my own - a baby boy, nine months
old, was misdiagnosed by the family doctor and by the time his parents, who
were old style working class and always believed what 'authority' said, took
him to hospital despite the doctor's refusal to send him there, he died,
within two days, of pneumonia. In no way could the child be said to have
made any choices nor could one say that the child was NOT a victim of a
whatever, in this case an arrogant incompetent doctor in combination with a
virus. That child was my brother. I can think of no end of such cases: a
woman I once worked in spent six months in a mental hospital and then had an
operation to remove a non-existent brain tumour which was supposed to be
causing her behavioural problems- the stress of the operation brought on
multiple heart attacks which killed her. Only post mortem was the truth
found - she had an EAR INFECTION which could have been cured by a short
course of antibiotics but had never been diagnosed, it slowly poisoned her
over two years causing her to go mad and led to her death. Things like this
happen all the time and they are not the result of individual failings on
the part of the victim. Rather, failings on the part of others, and of the
way our world is run.

I understand what you=92re saying. I=92m not discounting the importance =
of
individual character in succeeding in life. I tried simply to focus on a
direct reply to Kirby based on my own observations. Now, to say a few =
words
about individual character.

=20

Aside from the social factors we discussed, support of family, valuing
education, etc., individual character plays a key role. At the risk of
contradicting myself, I=92ll even say a paramount role. I believe that =
if you
take any group of people and put them in an urban hellhole, that a =
certain
number of them will succumb to their environment, but others will, on =
the
basis of their own character, decide to do what is necessary to obtain a
better life.

=20

Because of my Tourette Syndrome, I suffered horrible abuse for much of =
my
life. People knifed up coats my mother couldn=92t afford to replace, put
obnoxious things in my lunch. I was the guy who did everybody=92s =
homework but
didn=92t get invited to the parties they threw. (No big loss, in =
retrospect,
but painful back then.) People routinely challenged my abilities and
underestimated my intelligence to the point of insult. It would have =
been
very easy for me to go on disability at 18, sit round the house all day
reading comics & saying goofy things when people came to visit. It would
have been easier than finding jobs, most of which I was deemed =93too =
nervous=94
to work at. Some part of me believed I deserved better, and I stayed =
with
it. At 28, on chemotherapy for Hodgkins Diseases for 2 =BD years and out =
of
work for 2, I could have collected Social Security Disability for life.
Instead, I threw one of several Hail Mary=92s in my life & landed the =
job that
got me my pension (in addition to a lot of harassment that curiously =
ended
in 1994,when I received my Tourette Diagnosis and some people realized =
that
if they so much as breathed wrong I could  sue them and win under the =
ADA).
As a writer, I went unpublished for years. I stuck with it until one =
year
magazines accepted almost all my work of the previous 10 years. Maybe =
I=92m
flattering myself, but I believe it was my character that=92s gotten me
everywhere. I had the guts to get off the floor from repeated pummeling =
and
fight back. Now I judge people on how badly they want =93it=94, on the =
strength
of their hearts and their backbones.

=20

As far as kids not liking school enough to continue, I understand that. =
Most
high school kids have the innate good sense to realize that a lot of the
demands in school make little sense. They have more to do with =
institutional
control on a military model than on common sense or recognition of =
student
needs. When I subbed for a time, I couldn=92t discipline kids for =
chewing gum
without feeling ridiculous. I felt much the same way about college, but,
during the Vietnam War, would have been drafted the minute I dropped =
out.
I=92ve learned more on my own than I ever have through courses.=20

HI,
I am working for a group that is trying to do something about kids
dropping out of high-school in my community. I find this discussion very
interesting.

drop out? fade out? pushed out?

After all the outrage & condemnations Republicans unleashed on L.A. rapper
Ice-T following his "Cop Killer" release, who would've imagined they'd riff
off the Iceberg to justify war on Iraq?.

From Ice-T's 1989 Freedom of Speech album:

"They can't take this one thing away from me
that's got more power than any gun in the world, you know what I'm sayin?
I'm talkin bout brain power homeboy
My lethal weapon is my mind."

From "Axis of Evil" speech writer David Frum's reasoning for the invasion of
Iraq, despite solid evidence of WMDs:

"The greatest Weapon of Mass Destruction is the human brain."

Indeed, this is your subject, and it too is true, evidenced by your =

And your young brother was deprived of his ability to make something of =

And David, don't you think Vernon's successful rise above his ailment =

Subject:      musing...
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

one thing i continue to be struck by is how insular the discourse of
poetry and poetics can be... on the one hand this serves to insulate
the field somewhat from the kind of rampant commercialism that's
eating away at the soul of our culture, such as it is...

on the other hand, it can be just a little precious...

i've been giving a lot of thought to this lately---a lot of my time
at the keyboard in the past couple of years has been spent
collaborating on screenplays (some success of late, though no money
in the bank just yet---give us time!)... so if i wiggle my fingers
over the keyboard and produce a poem today, and tomorrow tickle the
keys a little differently to produce a scene, it's probably
understandable that i'll begin to ask how the scene relates to the
poem, and vice versa... different teleologies, marketplaces (if this
latter word can be applied to poetry---and i think it can), perhaps a
different phenomenology of writing... but it's still me sitting here,
at the keyboard, wiggling my fingers and hallucinating about the
alphabet...

i suppose that's part of what i like about writing... alternately
joyful, playful, difficult work, but still work---that's how i
understand it (to tie into a recent thread)... i teach too---also my
work (and as a college prof, the two come together in all sortsa
ways)...

conventional screenwriting---writing pretty much according to a tried
& true structure (which can be departed from to an extent, esp. if
you Know Someone)---really is a business in a way that poetry is
not... but there is a business that supports poetry publishing,
zero-sum game or no in terms of capital, and most poets have
ultimately to concern themselves with same to varying degrees... for
one, there's no such thing as a free lunch... fiction writers,
generally speaking, have it easier in this regard---i would say, too
easy!... as a poet i might never have had to acquaint mself, for
instance, with the ins & outs of literary agencies... but by the same
token, so many fiction writers seem to write fiction with such a keen
eye on film, options, advances, etc... while i understand this, i
often feel that my impulse to make money via screenwriting, while
perhaps producing something worth its weight in social
responsibility, is a better strategy than to pursue novelistic
storytelling with too focused a cinematic aspiration... ergo i often
find mself saying, 'if you want to write stories, why then write
scripts'---and maybe save a little rain forest, to boot...

i wouldn't call this attitude on my part anti-pulp, exactly, albeit
the pulp industry can really wear on me at times...

scripts are probably best thought of, in any case, and as steve katz
once told me, as work proposals... i like that---"let's get together
and spend 50 mil on my idea"... ok then!... i like the way this
foregrounds the collaborative nature of the process, and the money
issues, and i like the way it backgrounds, for a change,
literariness... it's refreshingly brutal too---if someone doesn't
like your script, it's b/c they don't think they can make money off
of it, period... and sometimes i'd rather be at the mercy of the
bottom line than hear "i don't love your work enough to publish it"
(whatever THAT means, as i've had this latter coming back at me from
senior editors of major publishing houses)...

in fact i think one way for poets to stay solvent, and perhaps to
improve the public status of poetry,  is to direct their talents with
words into as many other venues as they have time and volition for...
i think the public domain needs poets, needs the histories and
rituals and (to borrow from berger) ways of seeing that poets bring
to the world (and i know i'm not the first person to say so)... and i
honestly do believe that poets, like other artists, are responsible
for helping to shape the context for the reception of their
writing... this is one reason why i see literary theory (e.g.) as
having so much to do with the generative concerns of creative writers
(and suddenly i've become an academic, i know!)...

not trying to be provocative---just uploading some of my thoughts to
the list, which i haven't done in quite a spell... maybe i should
start a blog? (just kidding!)...

hope there's something here worth chewing over... thanks for listening...

best,

joe

Dad?  I=92m thirsty.  Can I have some lemonade?
I love the marching and the colorful flags on display.
I love going with you to the parade.

All that procession. And the pageantry,
I love the marching, the soldiers.  And the way that they...
Dad, nothing sure beats the heat like some cool lemonade.

So how can I make a living without a college degree?
The Marine Corps like you, but no Viet Nam. My rent paid.
And one day I might march in a Memorial Day parade.

I wish Paris Island woulda helped me see...
Spinning in midair, the flying grenade,
The blistering heat, the horrific pain. I want some lemonade.

Black planes silently slip over the coca-cola sea...
C'mon, poetry, man?  My fucking guts were flayed.
Ribs on the grill.  A meal at the Dead Soldier parade.

How could I have lived by such blind stupidity?
You know there ain=92t nothing worse than dying in a VA.
Life gave us both lemons. We wanted some lemonade
And let someone else make it.  I once loved a parade.

I just wanted to say how much I appreciated your and Alexander's posts giving
background.  If you're in Florida have you read Charles Willeford's book
Sideswipe?  It's a kick about a retired painter (he painted stripes on cars at
Ford Company) who gets involved with an armed hold-up band in between sessions
of shuffle board where he talks philosophy with his mates in a crummy suburban
park.  Quentin Tarantinto loves Willeford.

Can you explain more about Tourette's?  Does it get into your poetry?

Is it true that Samuel Johnson had this?  Any other famous writers?

Johnson's work on the dictionary was apparently interrupted by fits of
cursing....  do they have medicine now that can control it?

I'd like to twirl this thread to some new 'poetry' markets I've found
through the internet.  One is geezer.com and the other is Edward Picot's
hyperlit exchange   I suspect there might be others and I would be happy to
hear about them.

new software automatically eliminates

unwanted strands from the genome

while leaving a digital imprint



theology of display

insect or man shall be the sole survivor

signed PLENITUDE, inc.

discounting shoe traces

burnt into the pavement

the festival of the earth's end

myopic bargains of light

I'm glad you appreciate it.



I'm in Florida, an hour north of Miami, but don't know about Willeford's
book. I love Florida mysteries for light reading, so I'll check it out,
though my current reading pile is arguably the first mountain in Florida.



Tourette is a genetic neurological condition whose defining symptoms are
motor and vocal tics. It's known primarily for the people who have
coprolalia, or involuntary cursing. Other major symptoms include depression,
obsessive compulsive disorder, sleep disorders, and several thousand others
that vary markedly from individual to individual. It's not an entirely
negative condition. People with Tourette tend to score 15 points higher on
IQ tests. They're known for their physical and mental alacrity. That we're
creative is one of the more flattering stereotypes. It's nicer than
accusations of demonic possession, another stereotype. Some of us have an
antic sense of humor.



Samuel Johnson had Tourette Syndrome before it had a name. I don't know of
any other writers who had it, although Mozart did. Baseball player Jim
Eisenreich and basketball player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf had Tourette. I visited
Johnson's house in London to pay my respects.



I'd say my poetry (and my fiction) very much reflects my Tourette. Aside
from Charles Olson's influence, the way I use the page is very much an
example of the way the Tourettic mind works. In my fiction, particularly, I
give my antic humor free rein. It's difficult to explain Tourette unless
you've seen it in action. But a lot of my work creates an aura of sensory
bombardment and that's a feeling you get from Tourette. Your receptors can
get overloaded quickly.  Our brains tend to work a little differently. We
have disinhibition, which allows us to pull ideas from outside the box and
find ways to fit them inside. Every now and then you'll find a quirky phrase
in Mozart that you probably wouldn't find elsewhere.



Treatments for it vary but none are 100% effective, and the effects of any
of the medications vary markedly from individual to individual. A "standard
treatment" is virtually impossible, I'd say.  Haldol and Risperdal cause
tardive dyskenesia, irreversible twitches. Haldol causes weight gain and
social phobia. Other drugs can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels.
Certain naturopathic medications---St Johns Wort, Taurine and Vitamin E, for
example---taken in combination can reduce tics significantly with minimal
side effects. A growing body of research is showing that marijuana is very
useful in treating Tourette. Nicotine also reduces tics. Many people with
Tourette self-medicate because very few doctors know how to treat Tourette.
They think that if you've stopped ticcing the treatment is effective. But a
drooling zombie can't use the positive aspects of the condition. So, many
Tourettics work out their own concoctions with or without medical help.



Thanks for asking. You gave me an opportunity to explain a little-known and
very misunderstood condition.



Vernon

Here's an invitation from Marisa Simon, curator of WORDSMITH events at
Halycon in Brooklyn, New York.

ALL WORDSMITHS EVENTS ARE FREE AND OPEN TO THE PUBLIC:

SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 12:30PM:
POETRY with EILEEN TABIOS, PATRICK ROSAL and BARRY SCHWABSKY

EILEEN TABIOS is [the mischievous Chatelaine at
http://chatelaine-poet.blogspot.com.] PATRICK ROSAL's collection Uprock Headspin Scramble and Dive: Poems
was hailed as an "astonishing first collection by a young poet of immense
gifts," by Thomas Lux. Rosal's poems have appeared in Footwork, The NuyorAsian
Anthology and The Beacon Best of 2001: Great Writing by Women and Men of All
Colors and Cultures. He teaches literature and writing at Bloomfield College in New
Jersey. Art and literary critic BARRY SCHWABSKY is an editor for Artforum
Magazine and the author of The Widening Circle: Consequences of Modernism in
Contemporary Art (Cambridge University Press). In addition to penning the
introduction to Vitamin P: New Perspectives in Painting (Phaidon), Schwabsky has
written a number of monographs of contemporary artists. The first full-length
collection of his poetry, Opera: Poems 1981-2002 (Meritage Press, September 2003),
was called "an intensely wrought, luminously gripping book" by Publisher's
Weekly.

WORDSMITHS, a spoken-word series showcasing both established and
up-and-coming writing talent is curated by Marisa Simon. Winter 2003 Wordsmiths readings

TROUBLE IN PARADISE 1.0


Esas cosas no pueda escribir, gringo,
no debes, no, son secretas.

Bueno, I thought, why'd you tell
me them then, you're always talking ?!

As ever, he read my mind - I can
talk about them because I

am more than you are who are
you - you are nothing.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

No more           he does not
                  understand
                  that now
whenever he abuses me so
                  I shall
                  write it

and I will
                  publish

                  it
                  .

Here
                  .

Not what he tells me nor
                  has
                  told me
no,               no secrets,
                  but yes
                  the
way ese buey
                  me abusa
sí
lo diré           .

To tell the secrets would be to
suffer the others to suffer for his
sinking lips loose ships unjustly or justly

so I will         not

t o d a y         .

But to tell the way he treats me
(the good and       the bad)

this              I
shall             do

                  here
and
       there
                  whenever
I
decide            he
deserves  such    a
venganza de malinche buey no way
sí                way
guey              ese
señor             Huerta

sí                he is so much

bigger            than I
                  am nothing
yes               .

Aunque me mata por perra sí .
Even if he kills me for a bitch yes .

¡Ay que feas palabras oh what ugly words!

je je je I feel better writing them down
now I am free but like bloody footprints
on the            floor
they              trail
                  behind

                  me yes

and their blessed fury is cringeing in
my own shadow of fear for truly I do fear
him and what he could do not only his anger

but

I could lift up the telephone with one hand, gringo, and
dial one number to have your fat ass thrown out of this
country as an unwelcome foreigner, yes, I could

it would be so easy, do you know, do you know article 33 ?

well, at least he hasn't said that recently

and, in fact, except for the "I am so much bigger, you are nothing"
day before yesterday

he has been truly a gentleman of honor

even called the plumber to clean out the stopped drain

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm I suppose I should
count my blessings

and

remember that the Devil you know is usually better
than the devil you don't...................................

heh heh heh

but                                  yes

I still like him

he has fire                   this devil does

one can almost warm oneself on a cold night

watching the way he growls and sparks

oh
                    y e s

one      can                   a l m o s t

those hanged swung hand in hand
gone suddenly mechanical as
oratory grappled at their toes
not bounced up into collapse
wait stretch it break sight no NO
the hypnotize tucked almost out of sight
breath dropped beneath them yes
the mechanical gone where the silk is
where hands are dispatched into tresses

Dear All,
My ongoing blogpoem, Copy, has just surged past the 200 limit. Do come
visit:

http://www.sonofissue.blogspot.com

ccv.
Growing menace of the
outside world. 'Why she
would consider becoming a

suicide bomber.' Over a new
drug. There are also anomalies
in force. Not content with

being bigger. Disdainful rather than
needled. Overspend is new
blow. Hole in defence. At

home.

Hi Alex

the examples I used were of course anecdotal and therefore partial but, in
any serious consideration, the notion that success is a result of individual
effort is not tenable: how could one argue that a victim of a nazi
gas-chamber had failed to rise above their circumstances and chosen their
destiny? or that the sailors on HMS Hood were somehow responsible for the
design fault in British battle-cruisers which had become obvious in the
Battle of Jutland and the Admiralty had ignored obtusely, blindly, and which
enabled the Bismarck to blow up the Hood and all but three or four of its
crew with a single shot? or that the children who died under a collapsing
slag-heap in Aberfan had somehow failed in their life-choices? No, no and
no.

Even a vegan might be accused of injustice by a lentil.

Best

Dave

David  Bircumshaw wrote:

"Things like this
happen all the time and they are not the result of individual failings on
the part of the victim. Rather, failings on the part of others, and of the
way our world is run."

But David, when you say that, you change the subject slightly.

Is it true we are what we make of ourselves in this world?  I truly believe
we are, and I also believe some have an easier time in that effort as a
result of their family fortune, etc.

But, is it also true any of us is capable of screwing up, even the super
educated of us?

Indeed, this is your subject, and it too is true, evidenced by your
examples.  And, when doctors screw up, some one can die; that's one of the
reasons for the high cost of malpractice insurance, that and the sue-happy
world of civil action lawyers.   But that too is a different subject.

And your young brother was deprived of his ability to make something of
himself because of the errors of others....that point doesn't devalue nor
disprove the thesis: had your brother been allowed to live, he too would
have become what he had made of himself.

And David, don't you think Vernon's successful rise above his ailment
through his own struggle and efforts demonstrates that even he too is what
he made of himself?

Indeed I think this is more than just a thought. You have to throw away

have seen the truth, and what it contains
spells hell. A place of blogs, of self
and improvements (scan that)
of denial stacked like a gambler's pack
of lie lying upon lie. Shoot that poker,
man, it's the game. The game being

man, being woman, being any trick
you can play, being a part of apart.
Love, thou art infinite soiled board

upon which
                  we sit at meat
for the memorial
            of the guilt we own.

Da-dah.

TIME MOVES & CHANGES


Time  moves  and   c h a n g e s .  It feels
different than space with its square corners.
It measures    one way  or   n o t   another,
but   w e    keep  making   right angles  on

the map.

A leap of faith  measures  this disjunture
across the border of thought.  Stop voting.

Presidential candidates scream Disneyland
but  the border  hears  trolley  tourists

w a l k i n g .

Your blinking eye sees the signs in Spanish
and in English.   T a x i s  swim  upstream.

The unconscious click of billiard balls in this alley
b a c k e d   up  to  noisy markets and juke box bars

n o     c h a n g e .

The talk was endless, the drinks reasonable.
Price felt  no object  until  you had  none.

Money left and came back again on wings
of  time  and  work  and  interest  due

the chase of the whale and the cattle
brought this world from old gold rush

a fragrant shore of  wonderland  in  Cauli-

Vernon, All that I knew about Tourette's is that there is a censor in most
brains, and that in Tourette's the censor doesn't work.  I'm glad you confirmed
my suspicion regarding Samuel Johnson.  I remember reading that he went verbally
berserk and had to be chained to the wall of his studio.  And I speculated that
he must have written the first English dictionary in order to keep his mind off
other words.  He also had only three legs on the stool he sat on apparently to
focus his mind so that it wouldn't go into the rampaging of Tourette's.

I was wondering then if poets like Rimbaud, the surrealists generally, wanted to
try to simulate a Tourette's type outburst with the idea of "convulsive beauty"
-- at the end of Nadja, and elsewhere, became a kind of rallying cry.  I wanted
to ask you if sometimes then the outbursts would be like poetry in that it came
from nowhere -- as Corso put it -- "risked and fevered thinking"  -- arriving
with nails (a sort of Christian image, it always seemed to me -- a sort of inner
Passion, or crucifixion -- what am I saying sort of deal.  Corso wrote in a kind
of paroxysm it seems -- a burst of language from other sources.  Spicer talked
too of receiving radio transmissions from Mars.  It's not the conscious mind
that is working here, some sort of verbal outburst from another area of the
mind.  Is this very similar to Tourette's or not?

Why is it that dirty words are often pronounced?  In Christian people it's
satanic imagery that comes to the front.  I used to have a neighbor -- a woman
who went to my church who would break out into torrential outbursts of satanic
coprophilic imagery with Christ at the center.  It was quite wonderful to listen
to through the walls of the apartment.

Can you write then when you are having an outburst?

I wondr how many people have this condition.  Is it genetic?  What is the
physical reason for it?  What happens in the mind that causes the verbal
outburst?  Now that they have done brain scans and can observe brain activity --
is this identical to what happens during a creative outburst?  Could I make
myself have a Tourette's type outburst?

That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in

sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or

whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter

One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first

If you don't have doubt, you don't have anything.  For one thing, it

SPECIAL NOTE:
WRITERS WANTED!

Date: Thu Jan 22, 2004¬?
Subject: Calling All Writers (new literary publication)

January 20, 2004

Folks:

I, along with Brian Alan Lane, have just joined Matt Herlihy as the
editors of Sweet Fancy Moses. SFM was started by Matt three years ago as
a literary webzine. If youÇÄôre familiar with the SFM website
(www.sweetfancymoses.com), you know that itÇÄôs been a reliable source
for great fiction and creative non-fiction.

In SFMÇÄôs second incarnation, the format will change. SFM will soon be
transformed into a quarterly, fiction-only (print, not web) literary
journal. You will be able to find back issues of SFMÇÄôs web and print
editions on the website. The creative non-fiction component that was
formerly part of SFM will be spun off to a new site called Tales Told.
Tales Told will feature all sorts of non-fiction content, from
serialized life histories to essays.

So hereÇÄôs the deal: I need fiction. I want the best
short-to-medium-length fiction I can lay my hands on. We are,
unfortunately, limited to writing in English but the world is huge and I
want to see the world represented in our pages. 10,000 words¬?is our
maximum story length and we are interested in all genres. We welcome the
submissions of published and established writers but we will not favor
published writers over newcomers. Everyone who feels their work is ready
to be read by the world is invited to submit. The quality of the writing
will be the only arbiter of our choices.

All accepted authors will be paid, on terms to be disclosed upon
acceptance. No simultaneous submissions will be accepted.

How to find us: Because were accepting (and expecting) submissions from
all over the globe, we will not be maintaining an Inbox in the material
world. You can find us at submit@sweetfancymoses.com. Stories should be
in MSWord, sent as attachments.

The deadline for the next issue (Summer 2004) is March 1, 2004 and we
will respond to all authors by May 1st. With each submission, we need to
know:

Story Word Count
Your Name
Your E-mail Address
Your Address
Your Phone Number

Send your best work! My hope is that every person who reads this letter
will pass it along to every writer they know (with a special eye to
covering as much geographical distance as possible) and that IÇÄôll soon
be besieged by submissions from every corner of the world. I look
forward to reading you all.

That's a simplified explanation, but more or less accurate. The biochemical
theory, as I understand it, is that people Tourettics have a deficiency of
serotonin in some parts of the brain, which leads to depression, aggression,
etc. On the other hand, some parts of the brain have a surplus of dopamine,
which causes high-energy reactions. When I'm doing 4 things at once or
moving at what others may perceive as incredible speed, I assume I'm
experiencing a dopamine surge.



The notion of "convulsive beauty" could relate to the kind of ecstatic
feelings I get at "peak moments," but I doubt the Surrealists knew much
about Tourette. I understand "fevered thinking." That's me when I'm on a
roll. What you're talking about has definite analogies to Tourette.



I have no idea why people swear during outbursts. One common feeling among
Tourettics is "nerves rubbed raw." This creates a state of irritability that
can be triggered easily. I think I read somewhere that people with Tourette
have had profane outbursts in languages they didn't even know, but I won't
cite that as a fact. But the condition does seem to stimulate some of us to
do the opposite of what's socially acceptable.



I can't write when I'm having an outburst because the outburst is usually
related to the *&*^*% computer not working properly, which automatically
prevents me from writing. When I write I rarely tic. I'm focused so fully on
what I do that I wouldn't hear cannons blasting in my ear. The naturopathic
psychiatrist who put me on the right track with meds understood "how you
guys can lock in." We're capable of intense focus. But when I'm done with
the focus, my tics come back. I don't try to hold them back because it just
worsens the tics later.



Estimates vary, but about 1 in 1,000 has it. Studies suggest there might be
more people who have it but go undiagnosed because the doctor's don't know
enough about it to diagnose it or because their symptoms are an occasional
cough or blinking of the eyes. It's definitely genetic. Nobody knows exactly
what combination of genes causes it, but the question generates a lot of
research grants. I assume biochemical power surges cause the outbursts and
that the same chemical imbalance can fuel creativity. The profane outburst
and the creative outburst are comparable in their intensity---actually, the
profanity might be highly creative, s in the case of the woman you
mentioned. I think a lot of Tourette symptoms are chemically "enhanced"
responses similar to what people without Tourette (note that I don't say
normal) feel.



Since Tourette involves a chemical imbalance, I think you'd have to find a
way to create the chemical imbalance if you wanted to have a Tourettic
outburst. I don't know how you'd do it.

Vernon, The one other question I had was how similar this was to what some
people experience in the more ecstatic churches having to do with talking in
tongues.  You seem to indicate quite close because you spoke of speaking in
other languages at times.  Also the serotonin angle: LSD is supposed to simulate
surges of this (that research is quite old, but that was my understanding of it
based on an article I read once in high school).

I don't have any further questions.  Thanks for answering all this.

Best,

Indeed, you gotta have it (Spike Lee ~ by any means necessary).  The
trick, as always, is to throw it away (ie. to lay it down). This is
something you can learn to do -- not to seek the sign of truth after the
acquisition of ideas (ie. to let it be). Know yourself: if happiness is
far away, it will show up some day (ie. absolutely).

ie. Why does the king 'sit' on his throne instead of standing above all?

The above analogy is to demonstrate the role of 'work' in a poet's life.
That's all. Really. ;-)

essay on codework

like every other style, codework will disappear as soon as it's born, an
uncomfortable miscarriage of the beginning and defensive tactics of the
classic information age. codework attracts its share of quacks precisely
because it _is_ quackery - and doesn't one ever get tired of monospacing?
but there are more serious considerations here.:there's no demand for it, no
pleasure in it, it's ult to construct. one would think that problematic
linkages between programming and literatures would be fruitful, but the
programming is facile, at best explanatory or obfuscating, and it's already
dated as soon as it's written. you'd have to be the author to follow it.
it's a style that ties itself into a knot.:there is no transformation, no
knowledge. codework is a fraud. if i could code, i'd never use the
literature fakebook. my programs are absurd, a few lines at the most. i can
hardly configure a program, much less create one. codework is last vestige
of tradition, conservative in its subversion of code. it manages to escape
traditional aesthetic categories in favor of the mess, or knotted
striations. it's dated as soon as it's written.:the problem with
codework:tying oneself in knots

write first the fake or fraud through my like every other style, codework
will disappear as soon as it's born, an uncomfortable afterbirth of the
beginning and defensive tactics of the classic information age. codework
attracts its share of quacks precisely because it _is_ quackery - and
doesn't one ever get tired of monospacing? but there are more serious
considerations here.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Disposition: inline

jackson pollock mentions the fact that he "contemplat[es] painting would constitute a halfway state, an attempt to point out the direction of the future, without arriving there completely" while anselm kiefer states "[u]ntil the artist is dead, we are not able to determine his[sic] work in all its dimensions." Pollock gives us this view that the means of production are inherenetly forward looking while resisting an end, a finished product, by which to call a piece of art a finished product. i'm not sure i'd call this optimism, though; what i like better is the idea that, while an artwork is taking place - in other words, in dialogue with other art[s], theory, artists, even itself - it has no goal in mind but to take place, to look forward, but not looking forward TO ANYTHING. Kiefer, on the other hand, sees the artist's death as the catalyst sparking critique of the dead artist's work, implying that we hold our breath until the body of work is finished, completed, has found i
 ts end (or becomes an end by necessity of the artist's death). but taking pollock's view that we never fully arrive at a future but look forward to it, couldn't it be said that even the 'taking place' of a dead artist's body of work continue infinitely because it sparks dialogue still between itself and other works of art and between people and people and people and works of art, and so should the work, while the artist is even alive, provoke an evolving dialogue? somewhere in the domain of anticipation? the next move? moving within the folds? seems to me that kiefer wants to remove the folds, which only get in the way of a clear, determined evaluation. what is determined, then, in the sense of the word "determine", is that artwork's value is concrete and it's aim embedded in an historically situated integrity. fixed, let's say. while pollock is "hoping", kiefer is planning a burial plot. fixed. determined.

tao and nonce nonce tao tao it's dark in here
can you hear me can you hear me
i'm not at all comfortable at the moment
i'm not sure what 'im going to do but there are
there are errors at work here you can see the errors
for those for those who are
who are taking offf to baghdad
i've got to keep you here
i've got to give you something to look at
i've got to give you a memory
of weapons of mass destruction if you're going
if you're going there you've got to be prepared
for weapons of mass destruction - without preparation who really knows
what will happen
what will happen to you
you might you might be killed
you'll be on the tv
every american who is killed is onj the tv
every single one
image after image
we all lose people
the iraqis aren't there you don't know do you
how many are killed, there are always
a mess of them, there are always a group of them
or a pile by the side of the road
after the world trade center 9/11
after that everyone had a story
it was madness
friends were threatening suicide
people couldn't function at all
everyone remembered where they were that day
what they saw
what they brought with them for the rest of their lives
it's like that
and it continues -
they'd tell you their stories
they'd remember and tell yo and their stories
would go on for a long time, a second expanded
into a narrative that went and went as they tried
to come to grips with what happened to them
they couldn't they never could
and we'd hear the stories and which was the worst and which was even worst
than that and there was nothing we cna do with them. narrative is a way
that the american empire organizes itself and there's very little room
very little room in the vestibue
in the vestibule or GENKAN
for understand what might be the other or the OTHER
that appears from behind the tree and fires
or behind the house and fires away
and then collapses
there's no memory aftger that
there's
i'm losing my trace here my track here
i want to talk about something else
there's trash by the side of the road
there's trash there by the side of the road
it's floating away and i'm losing you
you're wondering where this is going
or how much of this you might have to endure
i'm fragile and i can hear voices behind me
they're talking away losing interst
this isn't the most important thing in their lives
this isn't in their lives at all
things will collapse and whole worlds will turn to nanotechnological dust
and there will only be
a fleeting glimpse
a fleeting glimpse
of frozen tracks of a bear or a deer
that's all that will remain and nothing else
there's a fury in that, a FURY!
that nothing else will remain, just those tracks -
and the heaps of bodies by the sides of the world
by the sides of the road
by the sides of the word
sometimes the technology fails
for example
the flash file didn't work through the projector
this happens and then there's a blank and a sound
and nothing else
you might be wondering where this is going at this point - seeing that so
many things are collapsing - even the sound seems a bit troublesome -
what's happening, why is it stopping and starting like this.
i feel people are staring at my back
TURN AWAY! LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE! can't you see - they can't see - I'm
typing in the dark - there's almost nothing visible....
so I'll try something else, we'll see what the projector does... that's
better - but there goes the image! we'll try again....
the world dissolves in god in plasma -
and this is a short film called 'murmur'
and it's the turning of the world on itself
and the turning and wait - there's got to be more
there's always the movie of the end of empire
or the last empire, i forget the title - you know the one - the no video
NO VIDEO one -
you can see - what else can I show you here?
on the left - the end of Empire
on the right - Europe 1915 just befrore the war
you know which war
these are some Europeans
they're down by the beach - they're down there - there's waiting for
something -
in silence they're waiting for something
where are their families their children
what ever
whatever happened to...
how much of this can go on -
I'm feeling my age here - I notice there's a blank screen just below the
piano one whatever went on it? where's it going? why did the ocean image
stop? why is the NO VIDEO still going on? Why does it say no video really
NO VIDEA? is this - not really - I was going to say - wait, I'll find out!
that's it - ok, more entertainment - well, that's a drag - just a blank
screen and then it jumped... ah well, hold on a minuite - this is getting
entirely out of control - you almost forgot just for a moment - the war -
what this started off with - remember the empire and everything else
associated with it?something is opening - something closing - there's too
many things happening here - look - I'm riding the machine maybe shutting
down? - no it's continuing - hee hee - just hold on - something will make
sense in a bi t- oh my god entertainment for the masses - now you're
really going to forget things - this is a cheap short - cheap shot = I
better retire for this - how many were killed today - I can't remember a
thing - things seem to be moving way out of control - I just can't
remember anything at this point - where are we - so far the usa has lost
around 500 soldiers -
this is what i wanted to talk about - i can't remember how many were lost
- on that other side - with the world trade center - i remember - it was
around 2700 - but it was first supposed to be - reported as - 5400 - then
it went down - they were americans - some afghani died a while later -
some of the - some of the iraqi too - or iraqis - or iraki or irakis -
some of them -
i don't know - this is more or less of a collapse - who would want to
watch this over and over anyway - there's a nova - I'll show that - a real
fast nova - it won't get away -
there's that thing - there's that nova -
there's that thing -
there's that nova -
thank you

Ancient traditions of the femur


The clay pot holds sperm,
but without further instructions,
we cannot contain nature.

Painted animal bones make poor pitchers,
or habitats for fish or war -

Although a pair of lives could still reside
inside the cavity, adorned in translucent motifs.

it's a very sad day.

and just as Ron Silliman wrote this morning on his blog,
Gil's "the closest thing Philadelphia has to a dean of poetry"
http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/

less than month ago, Gil agreed to an interview.  well, he
more than agreed, he was enthusiastic about it, and told me
when it was best to visit him at the hospital with my mini
tape recorder.  here's the link:  http://banjopoets.blogspot.com

less than 10 days later, i was surprised how difficult it was
for Gil to breathe when i visited with the proofs of his new
book Kyle Schlesinger had e-mailed me to go over with him.
he was able to talk quite freely for the interview, and it was
the most i had seen him smile and heard him laugh, as he
talked about his very rich life of poetry.

Philadelphia poets, and poets everywhere will feel the loss,
CAConrad

"Surplice," which is based on Sulpicia's occasional poems from ancient

OOD: Object-Oriented Design.

Gil Ott- poet & publisher, has died. He was an important culture worker &
anchor of the Philadelphia experimental writing community for many years. In
remembrance of what Gil has given us through his work & life, maybe we can
take this time to share what he's meant to us.

In his honor, the Philly Sound is creating a memorial page, where you can
share your thoughts & memories of Gil, whose generosity, warmth & humor
meant so much to the poetry community. Your messages will appear on the
Philly Sound blog as they come in.

Take care,
Frank Sherlock

Hi Frank and all,

So sad on hearing this.  Gil was really one of the kindest people I ever met and
surely one of the most dedicated to poetry.  He was, during my five years in
Philly, a very important presence, to me personally and to a lot of the younger
writers in town then, Kristen Gallagher, Louis Cabri, many others. And it goes
without saying that as editor of Paper Air and publisher of books like
Harryette's Mullen's Muse & Drudge he has made a deep and lasting impact.  I
wish his own poetry was better known and more appreciated.  Here's a poem I
published of his in Combo 4:

ght

What I began on foot I haven't
passed the opportunity to mediate

as tempers cool, and age,
more solid than a fish's swift encounter

begs calcium, from boyhood to a certain
indirection, oppresive detail, given

the yield of one small pond persisting
through rain and thought


I'll look forward to reading other's thoughts about Gil and his life's work.

-Mike.

May I ask that folks change the heading when the conversation has changed.
I had tired of the work/play thread for good and no doubt bad reasons, but
I am interested in this version.  Particularly since Greg Benford's
"/(slant)" contemplates near-future US where medication and nanotechnology
have been so integrated that someone can induce Tourette's into a large
section of the population.  She'd done it to herself in order to amp up
her creativity and logically thinks that the rest of the country could use
the same treatment.

The above is spoilerish, but the novel takes weird resonance in this time
in the Emerald City.

Robert

Robert, Vernon is saying that the more avant-garde churches that attempt to elicit
glossolalia are actually very similar to this.  I've been to these churches, but I
apparently don't have "the gift."  Raves, and extended derives, are probably also
intended to create a state like Tourette's.  Maybe crucifixion, too.  I keep thinking
about the link between Tourette's and poetry, via Dionysian "possession," as in the
Manson cult, or headbanging, or heavy metal, or Goth concerts.  Seems there is a
pleasurable side to this (thinking out the box) and an unpleasurable (the box
vanishes).  The woman next door with Tourette's could be very polite in the middle of
an episode

"Jesus fucking Christ, bloody ..."  "Oh, hi, how are you,"  "Fucking shitty tits of
God," etc.  A rather sad beaten down looking woman on social assistance in mid-Seattle
Capitol hill 18th street and Pine apartment.  She had been on the top floor for 20
some years, and you couldn't kick her out because she had papers for her disability.
I liked her fine.  She was a Catholic.  Everybody else in the building was much
crazier than she was, but to define how would cause a minor uprising on the board, and
I'm trying to have a relaxing week -- beat from shovelling snow.

Actually, Tourette's isn't any one "state," but several thousand. We're
human beings with supercharged central nervous systems. Yes, I do experience
f rushes that allow me to experience a certain kind of manic energy that has
elements of the ecstatic or the possessed about it. You'll find that energy
in a lot of my writing or in my jazz poetry recordings. But I also walk
around pretty much normally, glad for the sun and muttering about the bad
drivers. Tourette's is a much more complicated condition than anything I've
described on this list. I've described my own life, one hair or freckle on a
vast body. Kirby, your next-door neighbor was an interesting example of a
more severe case.



Maybe I was unclear. I intended to say that I think religious experience is
more common than we believe. You just have to find the stimulus
---sanctified church, Coltrane solo, skydiving---that brings you to the
ecstatic moment. It doesn't have to do with Tourette, just how certain
experiences elevate people's passions to an exalted level.



Robert, how can I obtain Bedford's "/ (slant)"? I'm always interested in
seeing how accurately other authors portray people with Tourette. Most of
the ones I've read have been pretty close, if not 100% on.

INFO: new york city--dany laferriere, haitian writers in north america
series
===========================================================

Exodus and Genesis: Haitian Writers in North America


This series on Haitian writers in North America will feature readings and

discussions in English by practitioners working in the continent.  These

poets and novelists are the purveyors of a new kind of literature of

profound significance to Haiti and the Diaspora.  No longer bound by narrow

nationalist conventions that historically constrained literary production,

these works have emerged newly animated by an insistence on the imaginative

interrogation of such subjects as race, gender, class, and national

identity.  While Haiti serves as the national site of creative inquiry, the

works of these authors exceeds those borders to treat the complex geography

of the New World. Indeed, this cohort of writers represents an important

part of Haiti‚Äôs new trans-national community.

I'm playing with the term "avant-garde" in order to create a funny perspective.  Because
usually the glossolalia churches are considered rather retrograde.  Passion/reason.  Reason
being more progressive.  Did you mean to send this post to the board?  It might get a
response or three.  I'll assume you wanted to and forward it as I found it interesting.  I
don't know very much about what an Episcopalian service is like.  It's funny to think of an
avant-garde church.  It's funny to think of Christ himself as the ultimate avant-gardist --
walking on water, creating miracles, helping the poor, and women, and healing the dead.  Is
he not the ultimate avant-garde figure, bringing together the very best of the communist
impulse, and the very best of the surrealist impulse?

I have overloaded on my allotment on poetics, as you have perhaps as well.
An Episcopal service is roughly similar to a Catholic one, except we only
have general confession and the sermon is called a sermon, not a homily.
Oh, and in my day, I found Our Lady of Grace to be a "casual Sunday" sort
of place.  Then again I didn't like all the three piece polyester suits at
the Baptist church.

I mean "avant-garde" in the sense that the Episcopal Church is a
relatively early adopter of supposedly "secular" ideas, such as having
women as priests, having out gay priests, and (now) having an (out) gay
bishop.  I assume that the Catholic Church has the the second and third,
except they can't admit it openly.

  Dear Book Artists:

  As many of you know, the June 2003 issue of the ISCA Quarterly (the 18th
  Annual Bookworks issue) was the final issue of a twenty one year old
assemblage
  project. So many artists and subscribers are still committed to continuing
on
  with the box of books that a new initiative, the ISCA Bookworks Jam will
make
  its debut in June 2004.

  This project will differ from the previous box of books in several ways:

  1. Artists will send a sample copy of the book they wish to contribute to
the
  Bookworks  Jam by by April 15th. A one page folded sheet will no longer be
  accepted as a â€œbookâ€. The title, artistsâ€™ name (printed) and
signature as well
  as edition number should be clearly indicated. Xerographic, computer
graphic,
  rubber stamped, collage, and mixed media will all be accepted, as will
fluxus
  items. Meaningful content, innovative form, and craftsmanship should be
the
  hallmarks of the sample book you submit. The edition number will be
determined
  by the number of submissions plus 25 additional copies for subscribers.

  2. Maximum outside dimensions are 9x11 inches. Edition due by June 1st
Each
  artist will be asked to prepare a page for the catalog which will
accompany the
  Jam,or perhaps each of you will create  a small catalogue of your other
books
  .

  5. The Society will finally get a digital camera and a web design program
so
  that the books can be seen on line. If any of you have experience in web
  design, please let me know. Any help will be appreciated. The constraints
of the
  file size on a free aol page may not be adequate and we may have to pay
for
  space.

  6. The cost to subscribers to the Book Jam will be determined by the
quality
  of the work you submit. I cannot solicit subscriptions until I know what
we
  have to offer. For now, we cannot count on any income from subscribers.

  7. Books from this first Jam, and from slides  of other books you may wish
to
  submit, will be selected for the beginnings of a traveling exhibit. Once
  more, scheduling venues for such an exhibition will not begin after the
first Jam
  is  launched.

  6. The cost of a web site, camera, etc. as well as postage and packaging
for
  the Book Jam Boxes each of you will receive , will  be covered by an
Annual
  ISCA Contributing Artists Membership fee of $35.

  Well, there in broad strokes is the plan. Please send your sample book to
  ISCA, 759 President St. #2H, Bâ€™klyn, NY 11215 by April 15th. and pass
this
  information on to your bookmaking friends and/or post it on an appropriate
bulletin
  board. Finally, please fill out the information below if you are planning
to
  participate in this project and return it to me it to me along with any
  questions you may have.

  Hereâ€™s to the future.

  Best wishes,


  Louise Neaderland
  Director ISCA

The New Brutalism Reading Series
presents
Lyn Hejinian and Rodney Koeneke
Sunday, Feb. 15th
7-9 PM
at 21 Grand
449 B 23rd St., Oakland
$4 cover for your thirsty maws

LYN HEJINIAN's most recently published volumes of poetry include "A
Border Comedy," "Slowly," and "My Life in the Nineties." The University
of California Press published a collection of her essays entitled "The
Language of Inquiry" in 2000. Since 1976 Hejinian has been the editor of
Tuumba Press and she is also the co-director (with Travis Oritz) of
Atelos, a literary project commissioning and publishing cross-genre work
by poets.  She will be reading from her newest work, "The Fatalist."

RODNEY KOENEKE's vocab ranges from Nineveh to Lollapalozza, even
reconciling them--"If you plan to take the Caddy down to Lethe," he
writes, "sad doggy bags of grist and bone you are." Koeneke is the
author of two books: "Rouge State," winnter of the 2002 Transcontinental
Poetry Award from Pavement Saw Press, and "Empires of the Mind: I.A.
Richards and Basic English in China" (Stanford UP, 2004). His current
manuscript, "musee mechanique," reflects the rhythms and terrors of a
year spent working in a souvenir shop inside San Francisco's Musee
Mechanique.

Hope to see those of you around the Bay there!

Subject:      Agamben's gesture
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Can these paragraphs about stigma by Bauman be brought to the problem
of the tattooed serial number, fingerprints ("subcutaneous tattooing")
and Agamben's refusal, which, in the invitation for "other European
intellectuals and teachers" to follow his example, escalating what
might be interpreted as an act of private conscience into the public
sphere of the political, and open to debate as such, since the refusal
could hardly appear more "incongruous" at a moment of almost
unparalleled migration and cross-border movement, not only into the
U.S. but among the soon-to-be 25 member nations of the European Union,
may be more deserving of thought than the immediate impression of
error confers? Ineffectual as such a gesture as Agamben's must be, and
beyond the limitation of the question of whether the politics of the
refusal are right or wrong, the shadow of the sharpening of divisions
arrives in the transparency of the translation from Italian to French
to English in the Le Monde article of the "foreigner" ("History
teaches us how practices first reserved for foreigners..."). Three
borders are subsumed at once in a word in which the disturbing
strangeness of the reappearance of national identity is inscribed. The
reminder that an institutional process has been set in motion which
intensifies the marking and selecting of "us" against "them" is
accomplished by the incongruity of Agamben's gesture, and Bauman's
remarks on the stigma are offered here to give more depth of
perspective to the problem of understanding the philosopher's refusal
to enter the United States.

"In its original meaning 'stigma' stood for the bodily signs that
signalled inferiority of character or moral wickedness. The concept
can be applied more widely to all cases where an observable -
documented and indisputable - feature of a certain category of persons
is first made salient by being brought into public attention, and then
interpreted as a visible sign of a hidden flaw, iniquity or moral
turpitude. An otherwise innocuous trait becomes a blemish, a sign of
affliction, a cause of shame. The person bearing this trait is easily
recognizable as less desirable, inferior, bad and dangerous. Partners
are put on the alert and forewarned of the possibily sinister
consequences of carefree interaction. They are also armed with the
information about the _virtual social identity_ of the members of the
stigmatized category; an identity difficult to be subsequently
disproved, however hard the stigmatized try to assert the _actual
identity_ they defined.

Stigma seems to be a convenient weapon in the defence against the
unwelcome ambiguity of the stranger. The essence of stigma is to
emphasize the difference; and a difference which is in principle
beyond repair, and hence justifies a permanent exclusion. Indeed, such
outward signs of an allegedly morbid interior are usually selected as
do not give up easily to human cosmetic skills. In the modern world,
with its belief in the omnipotence of culture and education (man is
'merely what education makes of him' - Kant asserted confidently;
'l'education peut tout' - confirmed Helvetius), with its constant
exhortations to self-improvement, and the axiom of the individual
responsibility for self-construction - stigma remains one of those few
residues of 'nature' which the redesigning and engineering zeal
exempts from interference and leaves in their reputedly virgin state.
Stigma draws the limit of the transforming capacity of culture. The
outward signs may be masked, but cannot be eradicated. The bond
between signs and inner truth may be denied, but cannot be broken.

Armed with such qualities, the institution of stigma is eminently fit
for the task of immobilizing the stranger in his identity of the
excluded Other. Were the stranger merely an 'uneducated' person, as
yet untrained in local habits and not properly adapted to native
conditions, the practical threat inherent in his 'multiple
incongruity' would leave the native defenceless. More dangerously
still, the inherent brittleness of _all_ identity, including that of
the native, will be blatantly exposed. An identity that anyone can
_acquire_ through diligence and effort is an identity which can also
be _shed_ at will. Such a 'put on, take off' identity is, however,
much too weak a foundation to sustain the secure existence
('integrity') of the group. The acceptance of the 'merely cultural'
(i.e., man-made, manipulable and rectifiable) roots of the stranger's
idiosyncrasy means in practice the reununciation by the group of its
passport- and visa-issuing authority and of its right to control the
border traffic. And an unguarded border is, for all practical
purposes, a contradiction in terms. Stigma staves off (or at least it
promises to stave off) all such dangers. Stigma is a cultural product
which proclaims a limit to the potency of culture. In stigma, culture
draws a boundary to the territory which it considers as its task to
cultivate, and circumscribes an area which _must_ and _should_ lie
fallow.

Since the signs of the stigma are essentially irremovable, a category
may cease to be stigmatized only if the signifier of stigma is
reinterpreted as innocuous or neutral, or if it is completely denied
semantic significance and thus made socially invisible. In modern
society there is a constant pressure to do exactly this. The pressure
cannot be easily neutralized. It comes from attributes quite central
to, and constitutive of modern society, like the principle of equality
of opportunity, freedom of self-constitution, responsibility of the
individual for his own fate - and may not be effectively countermanded
without contradiction and without generating new incongruities. After
all, modernity is a rebellion against fate and ascription, in the name
of the omnipotence of design and achievement. Stigma cannot but be a
thorn in its flesh; it restores dignity to the fate and casts a shadow
on the promise of limitless perfectibility. It is, therefore, at odds
with everything modernity stands for and everything that modern
society must believe in in order to reproduce its existence in the
only shape it knows of and is trained to cultivate."

Becks: Proud Censors of The Arts





Becks claims on its web-site to be proud sponsors of the arts.  On the surface, there may be some substance to this claim, considering their Becks Futures Prize, but underneath the gloss and publicity lies an ugly truth.  Becks are also censors of the arts.



A collage I designed for the cover of my forthcoming poetry collection, ‘Dropping Ecstasy With The Angels’ (to be published next month by Bluechrome) is a victim of Becks’ idea of ‘sponsoring’ the arts.



Because the collage incorporated a bottle of Becks, Bluechrome contacted them to seek permission.  Bluechrome were later called by the legal team at Becks to let them know, in no uncertain terms, that if they published anything that contained a bottle of Becks - or even something that looked remotely like a bottle of Becks - then they would be sued, big time.



Becks, the so-called ‘proud sponsors of the arts’, forced Bluechrome to withdraw the cover with threats of litigation.  ‘Dropping Ecstasy With The Angels’ will now be published with an alternative cover. I am disgusted that Becks can behave in such a hypocritical fashion, and I believe they should be exposed for their double standards.



Whilst Bluechrome and I are powerless to resist the corporate bully-boy tactics of Becks, I refuse to take this lying down.  Hence, this letter.  I appreciate you taking time to read this and hope you can give Becks the sort of publicity they so richly deserve.  Do spread the word to fellow writers and artists

MIME-Version: 1.0

Robert, the Episcopal theologian Thomas Cranmer was certainly broadly inclusive, as I suppose he
had to be, with Henry VIII on his back, and this openness does continue under what the Anglicans
later called The Broad Church (Locke and Berkeley and many others coming under that umbrella) --
but the latitudinarianism could also go too far in some opinions.  In fact, Cranmer was himself
burnt for taking in too much Lutheranism, I believe.  I was amused reading Shakespeare's Henry
VIII when Kathryn of Aragon says to Cranmer, "You run with the times, Cranmer."  Many of the more
conservative priests in the Episcopalian church regret the relativism, and believe that they are
heading into chaos with the acceptance of the gay bishop.

I'm completely unable to understand the whole argument.  I'm for gay civil marriages.  I hope our
church stays out of gay marriages, but perhaps this is simply because it is a tradition.  We're
probably going to start performing them some time after 2005 -- that's when the vote takes
place.  I don't want the pastors who don't believe in this to have to do it, but it's part of the
whole push of the Protestant churches, lit up with "progressive ideas" of inclusion stemming from
the 60s.

The great area between the absolutism of the medieval church, and the absolutism of the early
Protestants (based not on the church but on the Bible, according to Perry Miller's Orthodoxy in
Massachusetts, 1630-1650) is fascinating.  Now there is an attempt at changing the nature of God
altogether in many Protestant churches.  God is no longer timeless, but is a social construct; He
is not a living God, but some sort of mutual agreement.  Increasingly in our church it has become
politically incorrect to call God a He, or Christ his Son.  It's now -- Creator and Redeemer, and
the Holy Spirit is described as the Sustainer.  To not adopt these gender-free designations can
mean that you don't make it through seminary.  I worry that to make God a social construct and
not a living being is to simply destroy the beauty of the church.  If we accept Him as a living
being, of course we must then listen to his words in Leviticus as timeless.  Those words are
often terrifying -- and to follow them to the letter would go against the civil rights of almost
everyone.  So we're at a terrific crossroads.

Some more conservative theologians have described this as a new Babylonian captivity of the
church.

We are definitely moving toward a matriarchy, or at least toward a collapse of transcendental
values.  Probably nothing can prevent this.  Desire, rather than transcendent justice, has become
the new principle.  I'm quite ambivalent about it, but I was ambivalent about the harshness of
the OT, too.

Somehow I would like to see a church of comedy emerge.  At the same time I love all the old
solemnity of the church -- the lighting of candles, etc.  I'm not willing to wear ties, but I
like it when men do.  I seem to always be stuck between paradigms, trying to keep arguments from
closing.  Once arguments close, it seems to me that terror begins.

Is there room in Christianity -- from the pulpit itself -- for comedy?  did Christ laugh?

The only comic religion I know of is Gurdjieff's Sufism.  Can comedy articulate ultimate values,
or only tear down pre-existing ones?  These are some of the questions I ask myself, without being
able to get much traction.  Luther laughed a lot, and we laugh a lot in our church, too, but
Luther didn't laugh from the pulpit so far as I know.  And we mostly laugh before and after the
service.  Very rarely during it.  Our pastor did imply that Christ laughed from the cross, but I
wasn't convinced that he could laugh through that bloody mess.

(note to self: don't use the l word when writing the l--t)

I was struck by some intuitions I had at a Martin Amis reading from
"Yellow Dog."  The premise of that novel is that the main protagonist,
formerly a reformed "sensitive" middle-aged man, receives a knock on the
head and begins regressing to sort of imagined neanderthal and hence the
image of a knuckle-dragging, unreformed male.

Now, the faculty from the UW have recently published research that
correlate TBI (traumatic brain injury) with depression, substance abuse,
etc.  What I was struck by in the Amis' account of his protagonist was how
the character's state of mind could as easily have been the result of
depression, particularly the bigotry that he starts to spout, as if the
brain shuts down more complex modes of thinking since they lead to very
causes of the depression.

While I don't want to pathologize what I think of as aberrant modes of
thinking, nor to make depression more stigmatized--despite the press that
depression has received, it still lingers in some repressive twilight even
in our health care system, which is unfortunate because what the victim of
depression needs most is sympathetic (and comprehending) attention--but I
am curious about the nexus of TBI, substance abuse, depression, and what I
think of as anti-modernist thought.

Whew.  A lot there.  Please do unpack, correct, or explicate as necessary.

thanks,
Robert

cultures, tradition and modernity, perpetual migration and the sense of
home. In the course of this exploration, the poet is inspired by modern
and contemporary artists such as Wolfgang Laib, Piet Mondrian, Joseph
Cornell, Yoko Ono, and Felix-Gonzales-Torres.

Chris Murray will read from her most recent series, _Found_ as well as poems
published in Sidereality, Shampoo Poetry, Znine, can we have our ball back?,
Black Spring Online, xStream. She teaches creative writing and directs the
Writing Center at UTA, as well as blogging poetry at *chris murray's

Taylor Carlisle, Clayton Couch, Mark Weiss, Michael Helsem, Hannah Craig,
Dale Smith, Hoa Nguyen, Patrick Herron, Stephen Vincent, Brian Clements,
Kent Johnson, and Eileen Tabios.

Gabriel Lopez is a spoken word artist and a film studies student at UTA. He
has performed in NYC and in the DFW area.

Refreshments are being provided courtesy of Filipinana Resturant in Bedford,
TX. A raffle (proceeds going to expenses for the event) will be held at the
event: Three sets of Xian figurines, donated by Sunny Graham of Tarrant
County Asian American Chamber of Commerce.

Asian American Chamber of Commerce, and is organized by Chris Murray and
Writing Center Assistant, UTA Senior English major, Kristina Graham.

A person you might want to look into is Jim Eisenreich--very good =
professional baseball player--in the Major Leagues--he had =
Tourette's--used to be ridden mercilessly by fans as he played the =
outfield and they could hear him when he had his spells--swearing and =
making strange sounds--

he was out of baseball for a bit to get treatment, and when he returned, =
playing as well as ever--was giving ovations wherever he went for his =
courage--after the pain people hadinflicted on him--

another ball player (among many) who played with mental =
difficulties--many wild and bizarre episodes--Jimmy Piersall--wrote a =
book of his experinces, recovery and return to baseball after being in =
instituitons--FEAR STRIKES OUT--was made into a film starring Anthony =
Perkins--

You should be able to find quite a bit on Jim Eisenreich (i used to have =
his baseball card) as lot was written about him--saw him play many times =
on tv, Minnesota Twins vs. Milwaukee Brewers back when the Brewers still =
in the American League--

i don't know if this has been mentioned already -- but the film
~maze~ (2000, dir. rob morrow) deals specifically with an artist who
has tourette syndrome...

Upcoming Creativity Workshops in New York City and Europe
http://creativitycourses.us.com
http://www.creativity-course.com

We are all born imaginative, curious, creative, but these qualities can
fade with the passage of time. The Creativity Workshop's aim is to help
people get their imaginations back.

Hello,

My name is Karen Bell, administrative associate of the Creativity
Workshop. Here's the latest news on the Creativity Workshop's
courses in New York City and Europe.
Our next workshop: New York City
March 13 - 16, 2004, 4 day workshop
Saturday through Tuesday, 4 to 7:30 PM

Please see below our complete Calendar including our 9 day Summer 2004
workshops in Europe-- including classes in Crete, Florence, Istanbul,
Dublin, Venice, Provence, Prague, Barcelona and Paris!

Whether you are a writer, a business person, a teacher, or an artist,
the Workshop can help you discover and nurture your particular way of
expression and break through the fears and blocks that inhibit
creativity. Working with thousands of individuals, businesses, and
institutions since 1993, the Creativity Workshop helps people believe in
and develop their imagination through using a unique series of
exercises in memoir, creative writing, visual arts, sense perception,
brainstorming, and storytelling. Our concentration is on the process of
creativity rather than the product. We emphasize the importance of play
and the sharing of ideas to nurture creative growth.

You can read more about the workshop below and also go directly to our
extensive informational sites:

idea about the workshop's techniques, origins, and results.

What people say about the Creativity Workshop:

The new millennium needs bold, creative men and women who can turn their
dreams into reality... Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel show how you can
do this through their challenging and inspiring creativity
workshops...even a simple first contact will prove what these two
talented teachers can do for your own gifts." Dr. Kirpal Singh, Writer,
Professor, Singapore Management University.

I have attended at least 10 creative seminars and this creativity
workshop is far above the others in its inspiration, positive spirit and
techniques for nurturing creativity. The Creativity Workshop changed me
forever and moved me forward in managing my creative companies, but more
importantly in my personal determination, commitment and creativity in
my own projects. This workshop is important for anyone who wants to
better understand, develop and celebrate their creativity in their
  personal or business life.
Barbara Roberts, President and CEO
Acoustiguides, New York

Thank you for the great, great inspiration and fun of the Creativity
Workshop. It helped me get a whole screenplay done during a trip to
Mexico afterwards. It was great for me and my students. I don't think
I've ever seen them so happy. Doris Doerrie, Filmmaker, Professor,
Munich Film School, Germany

Shelley and Alejandro created an atmosphere where everyone from student,
to business professional, to published novelist felt equally comfortable
creating and sharing stories, drawings, experiences. I've explored other
places and workshops that make me feel good while I'm there, that
provide activities that I know I really should make time for when I go
back to the real world. But this workshop is the first to provide
methods and exercises I not only want to use but feel compelled to use,
in fact have already used. I need to mention what I think was one of the
key ingredients of the workshop: the other attendees. I found them to be
amazing, inspiring, fascinating people. Kelly Hevel, Planning Manager,
Pfizer, Inc., New York

"This is my third workshop coming up and I can't wait! Shelley and
Alejandro ever so gently are able to get us fellow travelers (and not
students) in to a discovery mode that emerges us deep into the
experience of our very own creativity. You are magicians who invite us
to return to the best of our childhoods. Once there we recapture those
golden days of play and dream and fantasy. I'm very happy to know and
experience the alchemy that you label a creativity workshop. Professor
Carroll Blue, School of Communications, San Diego State University, San
Diego, USA

"I feel as though I now have a focus, a method, a way of evolving my
ideas and that the means are just as important as the end. I have
created environments just to create in, and environments just to display
the work in. My vision of attending to each detail, sound, smell,
texture, substance... is starting to find a home. Thanks for opening my
eyes to these essential aspects of creating through your guidance and
example." Student. University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA.

"This class was THE MOST enriching, enlightening, inspirational class I
have ever taken. The way I work and what I create will never be the
same." Student. University of Iowa, USA.

"Shelley and Alejandro's Creativity Workshop is amazing in that it
breaks down all your fears about thinking and writing. If it wasn't for
them I fear I never would have finished my master's thesis. I was
blocked until I took this course." Francesca Salidu PHD candidate in
Shakespeare, University of Pisa. San Miniato, Italy.

"Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel taught their Creativity Workshop as
American Cultural Specialists under the United States Information
Service auspices. To say that they were extremely effective is a vast
understatement. I would unreservedly recommend their course. They have
abundant creativity, energy, and a wealth of skills." Gloria Berbena,
Asst. Cultural Attache, US Information Service, US Embassy. Rome, Italy.

"A special experience. Berc and Fogel opened us up to new and wonderful
ways of looking at our creativity." Belkis Bottfeld, PHD, psychologist.
Istanbul, Turkey.


The Creativity Workshop has been taught at educational and government
institutions and for corporations.

The teachers

Shelley Berc is a writer and teacher. She was a professor of the
International Writing Program at the University of Iowa from 1985-2000.
Her novels, plays, and essays which include 'The Shape of Wilderness',
'A Girl's Guide to the Divine Comedy' and 'Theatre of the Mind' have
been published by Coffee House Press, Johns Hopkins Press, Heinemann
Books, Performing Arts Journal and Theatre Communications Group Press.
Her plays have been produced by theatres such as the American Repertory
Theatre, the Yale Rep, and the Edinburgh Festival.


Alejandro Fogel is a visual artist and teacher working in painting, site
installations, video and digital art. He has exhibited his works in
galleries and museums in Argentina, Bulgaria, Cuba, France, Hungary,
Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, United States and Germany. His
ongoing project 'Root to Route' chronicles his father's journey through
the Holocaust years. His work is in private collections and museums
around the world.


Berc and Fogel explain in theory and demonstrate in practice the
concepts of originality, 'appropriation', memory and imagination. Under
their guidance, participants explore their own creative processes
through different writing and drawing exercises. They emphasize the
intimate link between personal and public spheres, individual and social
practices, history and myth, dream and reality. The focus of the
workshop is on process not product and to help participants find
life-long tools of creative expression.


Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel have taught their Creativity Workshop
internationally. They have lectured on creativity and their own work at
universities and cultural centers throughout the world.

Dear Family and Friends,

Read the following resume which was written by 2 professors at George Washington University and see if you would "hire" such a candidate.  I know who I will be voting for in November (or rather who I will NOT be voting for).

Hi all,

Our poetry editor, the incomparable Stephanie Young, has decided to step
down and focus on some bay area and new brutalist projects following our
April issue. A hearty thanks to Stephanie for all her great work and
counsel.

I'm pleased as all get out to welcome Carol Mirakove on as Boog City's new
poetry editor, effective with the May issue. Many of you are familiar with
her, but if you're not, the philly sound folks did a great job when they had
her as their featured poet back in november (bio, poems, interview, comments
from others on her work):

Are you kidding????
So, from what I understand below, Dee is upset that Becks limits itself to
supporting the arts with cash. Dee feels that Becks should allow her poems
to represent their product and vice versa, and is angry that Becks doesn't
agree.
Oh, puh-leeze... This kind of complaint is the reason many corporations
don't want anything to do with artists... If Becks refuses to support my
work by giving me a free six-pack for the muse, I'm going to blame Dee!

MASTHEAD LITERARY ARTS MAGAZINE

ISSUE 8

http://www.masthead.net.au/

It's been a long time coming, but I assure you, it's worth the wait.=A0 This
Masthead is the biggest yet, and features our most ambitious project so far=
:
a comprehensive retrospective of the life and work of Alaric Sumner , who
was until his death in 2000 the UK editor of this magazine.

Alaric's death brought to an untimely end the work of an artist whose sheer
variety of working methods - in performance, in visual art, in music and in
poetry - ironically obscured his achievement. Masthead guest editor Lawrenc=
e
Upton and I hope that this feature will redress a little of what has been
overlooked.=A0 And we hope that readers will enjoy the humour, audacity,
intelligence and beauty of this work as much as we do.=A0

The work is presented chronologically, and it is possible to follow the
restless evolution of his ideas to their fruition in some major later
works.=A0 As this later work especially demonstrates, Alaric died prematurely
- he had much to do, and was beginning to develop methods and styles of wor=
k
which were totally unique to him.=A0 "Remembering Alaric Sumner: A
Retrospective" is intended as a resource for anyone interested in Sumner's
work, and as well as the largest selection of his work available in one
place, we have included a series of interviews with people who knew and
worked with him, some extra documentation and a complete record of his
publications and performances.=A0

Issue 8 also features some exciting writers in their 20s: from Melbourne,
two writers deeply involved in theatre, Dan Spielman and Jasmine Chan, and
Mark Goodwin from the UK.=A0 But the young don't have it all their way:
there's a fantastic selection of poetry and prose from Michael Ayres, Trevo=
r
Joyce, Tom Lowenstein, Rebecca Seiferle, Colin Robinson, Mair=E9ad Byrne, Jef=
f
Harrison, Iain Britton and James Graham: which is to say, passionate,
formally questioning and various work from all around the globe, presented
here for your pleasure and delight.

Masthead at last has its own domain name at www.masthead.net.au, although
the archives of the past eight issues - Issues 1-7 plus the American Terror
special - will remain at the old site at http://au.geocities.com/masthead_2=
/
until further notice.

Hope I haven't used my allotment.

Here is the site for the research center:

http://depts.washington.edu/rehab/tbi/

as well their publications:

http://depts.washington.edu/rehab/tbi/publications.html

the article I am referring is "off-line," either because of nefarious
cabal or because our students can't get their act together in putting the
newspaper online.  in any case, the student article gets the emphasis
wrong, especially in the headline which is "Brain trauma tied to drug
use," (1) giving the impression that drug use leads to TBI; and (2)
emphasizing drugs rather that what the School of Medicine's short account
emphasizes, which is "psychiatric disorders," or what I prefer to call
mental illness.  that article is short but here it is:

http://depts.washington.edu/mednews/vol8/no02/brain.html

as for participating in a dialogue, let me think about it, Tom, let me
think about it over the weekend.

thanks,
Robert

Subject:      Gil's Shadow
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

We remembered Gil Ott last night at the Chax Press reading in Chelsea. He
cast a big, dark, deep shadow over the event. At times like this I am
reminded that shadows are the foundation of imagination.

Charles Alexander, Chax's editor and publisher, came to New York to
celebrate the twentieth anniversary of his press but also his new
collection, near or random acts, which is, as it happens, Gil's last
Singing Horse Press release and at the same time the first book in the new
life of the press, under the very capable hands of Paul Naylor.

I am glad I got to see Gil last week at the University of Pennsylvania
hospital intensive care unit. Bob Perelman and I went on Tuesday afternoon.
Gil was miraculously self-possessed, engaged with the conversation, ironic,
barbed. If my eyes had been closed I imagine I could have been across the
street, chatting in my office; there was little in his voice that reflected
the grim intensity of the surroundings or his physical circumstances. Gil
spoke of his forthcoming book, The Amputated Toe,  from Kyle Schlesinger's
Cuneiform Press as his "last" book and wondered if Kyle knew it was his
last. Bob and I offered a alternative meaning to last: "you mean your most
recent book." Then Gil told us the story of how anxious Franco Beltrametti
had been for Gil to bring out his Singing Horse book, though Beltrametti
never explained to Gil that he was dying, that this was to be his last book
(which, indeed, he did see before he died). Then Gil said, "Let's talk
about something else."

Gil also spoke of how extraordinary his prolonged life had been, the gift
of living without his own kidneys for a quarter of a century. He said he
was one of the longest surviving members of that class of early kidney
transplant patients and almost all we know of Gil and his work as a poet,
editor, organizer, has been in the period of grace provided by his renal
subversions.

My first memory of Gil is walking down Spring Street in the late 1970s,
going east from the Ear Inn, in the year or so after an unsuccessful
transplant. Like Ron Silliman, I remember how slow he walked, how
cumbersome and heavy his body seemed. And how, just a year later, he came
into a new life and new sense of physical and cultural possibility, after
his first successful transplant.

I remember Paper Air: the Mac Low issue and Taggart issue especially. And I
remember  Artifice of Absorption, my essay-in-verse, which was first
published as an issue of Paper Air in 1987 and which may have been part of
Gil's turn from magazine to book publishing.  This was Gil and my first
experiment with producing a book directly from a computer file. There were
so many errors that crept in that the process itself seemed to be insisting
on a level of textual impermeability well beyond the desires of author and
publisher.

But no number of anecdotes will bring Gil back from the dead: Gil, father
of a daughter just the age of my son (11), life companion to Julia
Blumenreich, friend to so many of us.

Dead poets have one trick left: they live in our ears, in our minds, in our
personal hearafter.

Robert,
     Thanks for posting.  One of the things I'm finding is that
psychologists (including me) and neuro people have not done well in
informing the general population about such things as depression (which for
some reason is seen as stigmatizing as you point out).  The APA www.apa.org
does a good job of this but I suspect their site is not high up on search
engines - actually a search did turn up some worthwhile sites even if it did
not hit apa.  I tend to blame this on the popular media but maybe I'm
talking myself into writing something.
    Damasio has a couple of books out and I'm reviewing _The Anatomy of Hope
by Groopman which should be out this month. I'd appreciate any other sources
people
might be aware of?


    There's no rush on the dialogue. I'm months ahead on the column.

Literary rescue
2/7/2004

READERS: Go buy books at the Grolier Poetry Book Shop on Plympton Street
in Cambridge! The one-room store is struggling financially, but open and
crammed with some 16,000 poetry books, according to owner Louisa Solano.

"I need as many sales as possible to pay off bills," Solano says
bluntly. And book-lovers can understand: It's better to rally the troops
to save a beloved store rather than organize a pity party once a
storeowner has no other option but to close.

Time seems to have bent around Grolier. Walk in and it could be 2004 or
1964. Customers are surrounded luxuriously by books. The featured
photographs of poets are all black and white. The sign hanging outside
says "est. 1927," boldly indifferent to being hip, new, or attractive to
cell phone-loving teenagers. Hand-written signs promise
African-American, British, Irish, Slavic, Chinese, and Australian
poetry. The center table holds a load of discounted books, their lower
prices a seductive way to attract readers to the work of lesser-known
poets. The store hosts a series of readings; the next one, on Feb. 19,
features Russian poet Dmitri Prigov.

What's Grolier's future? Stay tuned. Solano says several buyers are
interested in the store. Solano also talks of supplementing the store by
selling books on the Web -- a good idea that could attract top-dollar
buyers. So she's looking for a webmaster who could donate services to
rehabilitate the store's ailing website.

"I used to say: `I farm books,' " Solano says, explaining the physical,
mental, and emotional labor that she puts into the store.

It's hard to find that kind of passion in stores that sell logo-laden
products that come to seem strangely useless in a year or two. In sharp
contrast, Solano offers shoppers the more substantive fare that only
merchants of metaphor can provide.

Hi All--Can anyone recommend any good books on language acquisition?  I've
got an 11 month old starting to babble, and am fascinated (I've noticed
that he seems to work on consonants one day, and then vowels another day).
Pinker's The Language Instinct is on my shelf, but I'm curious to
know if folks have any other faves to share.  Could be anything from a
good book specifically intended for parents to something more scholarly.
Also, anyone know anything about the status of Piaget and those famous
"stages" I learned about back in college?  Are these still considered
valid, or have they been supplanted?  I don't even remember what they are,
but I've been thinking about looking them up...
thanks,
steve

Michael Rothenberg's Big Bridge has some of my rather Lutheran porn.  I'm
totally ashamed and I hope that everybody will read it.  There are also
pictures of Petra Backonja, and Alan Sondheim, and many others in the

There Was Never No Tomorrow,
Nuyorican Pedro Pietri In His Own Words

a storytelling edited by Raymond R. Beltr·n

La Prensa San Diego, February 5, 2004
http://www.laprensa-sandiego.org/current/pedro.htm

I have to admit that when I received a chain letter from the Nuyorican
Poets CafÈ, I hadnít the faintest clue who Pedro Pietri was. I hadnít
read the book Puerto Rican Obituaries, or any other world-renowned plays
or poems heís written, The Masses Are Asses, Traffic Violations, or
Invisible Poetry. Although, the Nuyorican culture he helped to create is
a name that stands firm in the ground of poetic minds across the world.

The letter said that this man, Pedro, is struggling with a tumor in his
stomach, one side effect related to the exposure to Agent Orange, while
serving time as a draftee in the U.S. Army during the climax of the
Vietnam War. The letter read that after surviving exploratory surgery at
Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center last month in New York, Pedro sought out
holistic healing at Oasis of Hope Hospital in Playas de Tijuana, MÈxico,
no more than thirty minutes from my neighborhood in National City.

In hitching a ride across the border with Calaca Press to visit Pedro in
hopes of raising his spirits and interviewing him for a story, I came
across a man whose experience and whose story helped to create a
Nuyorican culture, not far from the Chicano experience in the past and
in the present. In fact, they parallel. To ask questions and to receive
answers was not a problem. The problem was writing his story in a way
that you, the reader, would understand him. In wrestling with words,
Iíve come to the conclusion that only Pedro, El Reverendo de La Iglesia
de Tomates; Pedro, product of Operation Boot Strap; Pedro, Nuyorican
Poet; Pedro, Spanglish Metaphor Consultant of the Latin Insomniacs
Motorcycle Club Without Motorcycles; Pedro, Young Lords Poet-Laureate;
Pedro, honorary member of the Royal Chicano Air Force; Pedro, a person
who wonít let anyone determine his fate, and only Pedro, has the right
to tell his story. In conclusion, the following  is only an attempt at
that sto
 ry, through an interview from Oasis Hospital, and only after a careful
editing process. Meet one of the original Nuyorican Poets, Pedro Pietri,
in his own words ...
It was in New York City where I was trying to cure myself, thinking I
was a physician, and suddenly, I couldnít hold food. So, I asked my
brother and sister to take me to the hospital, and it was at
Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center where the bad news happened. They did a
CAT scan, then they did exploratory surgery, and they found the cancer.
Thatís when they cut me up and got scared, sewed me up and sent me home,
so I could waste away.

So, I come out of recovery, and this jerk came into my room with crushed
pieces of paper, and one of those crushed pieces of paper was my medical
record. They told me, ëWhat you have is incurable.í I told them, ëWhat
you have is incurable.í They were making it real hopeless, you know? And
that isnít the approach. Itís by being positive. That can heal. They
made it like life was over, so, I called Papoleto to the Intensive Care
Unit, because I refused to stay there. Papo came with the suitcases and
everything. I donít know how much time they gave me to live, but I gave
them the same time to live also. At least that way, I can rest in peace.
 That was the beginning of the end, and the saddest time in my life.

To take you back, I was born in 1898, during the climax of the
Spanish/American War. I say 1898 because that was the year that the U.S.
invaded Puerto Rico, the year when they colonized us. Now, I was born
again in ë44 to my mother in Ponce, Puerto Rico and again in í47, at the
age of three, when my folks migrated to New York City through the epic
of Operation Boot Strap. Weíre all part of the casualties of the
Inquisition, the American Inquisition.

I also say I was born in 1949, because thatís the day I went to the
first theatre with my grandfather, who felt deceived by Operation Boot
Strap and committed hara-kiri, but I donít think it was suicide. He was
killed by the system that deceived him, the system that made him sell
his land in Borinquen. What happened was the disillusion. The voices in
his head were of the Central Intelligence, compelling him to sever his
jugular vein. Think about his friends. Thereís nobody to talk to, nobody
to communicate with, and thereís nothing to go back to, but the
industrialization of the island that had deceived so many people. So,
that was the first theatre I went to, at Monjeís Funeral Parlor, in a
brown suit. Actually, that was my first teaching, or my first awareness
of Puerto Rican history. Puerto Ricans die and go to a Puerto Rican
funeral parlor. And Monje was a ghoul; he looked like a ghoul. How you
going to have the name Monje, and be a proprietor of a funeral parlor?
Youíll
 scare the customers away, but he didnít scare us away.

There were five of us, four guys and one girl. My elder brother had a
heart attack, and my younger brother went joyriding one night, and I
havenít seen him since. So, thereís a total tragedy, because then there
were only three of us. So then, we went back to Monje, and we kept going
back to Monje for other people. Every week there was a different
funeral, and after a while, I said, ëLet me just stay dressing in
black.í

Now, when we came to New York City, they sent us to public schools,
introducing us to the Nuyorican culture. I graduated with a general
diploma, thinking I was going to become a General in the army, ended up
as a private. I failed the post office exam thirteen times after high
school, and after failing all these examinations, the last thing I was
going to do was make a career out of earning minimum wages. ëCome to the
land of milk and honey,í they say, but they didnít mention the endless
dog shó you keep steppiní on, going to the welfare department, going to
look for a job. You step into reality; you step in dog shó. You step
into church; you step in dog shó, especially.

Now, before I was drafted to the army, they said I was incapable of
adjusting to military discipline, and I celebrated it. Then the Vietnam
War escalated, and they said, ëYouíre okay! Thereís nothing wrong with
you! Youíre not crazy!í So, they send the freaks to the front, and
thatís why my prize is the fondest memories of that country, and being
an accomplice to assisting America in losing itís first war ever.
Because it was then I realized who the real enemy was. I was just a
mercenary. So, I came back and wrote the Puerto Rican Obituary,
dedicated to my mother, and thatís the Vietnam that I wrote about Ö go
kick the ass of people who were born warriors; kill women and children
first, but only after you rape them. That made no sense. So, what do I
think about the war in Iraq? I donít think about it, because the war
never ended then. This is a war thatís been going on since the invasion
of North America.

So, I return to New York, and there was all these radical changes going
on at home with the Young Lords Party. Now, I wrote poetry before I met
the Young Lords, or the Black Panther Party. Back then, I was the best
poet at baptisms, funerals, birthdays, confirmations; you name it, I was
there. And it was all by memory back then, in the old tradition. I met
Jorge Brandon at Washington Square Park, who years later reappeared as
the Saint of the Nuyorican Poetry Movement. It was his influence that
made me decide whether it was poetry or suicide. We met again on Sixth
Street at Miguel AlgarÌnís apartment, with Papoleto Melendez, Tato
Laviera, AmÈrico Casiano, Lucky Cienfuegos, the notorious Miguel PiÒero,
and we used to read our poems there, our first draft poems. That is the
original Nuyorican Poets CafÈ, on Sixth Street, and thatís where I come
to the conclusion that the Nuyorican Movement is the First Draft
Movement, because we were all very enthusiastic about reading the firs
 t draft, something thatís rarely done now.

First draft is you scribbling it on a notebook, or a paper, or a napkin
and you read it there. And if you make mistakes, man, it makes the poem
much more interesting and exciting, and thatís when history started
being made. At the time, it was the decline of the Beat Generation, and
poetry went back to the universities and became an academic thing, but
here come these street poets, man, and we pushed academia out of the way
and took over the scene. What this movement did was give an audience to
all of our talented, the kind of poets that didnít have an audience.
Allen Ginsberg, Bob Dylan and the ghost of Pablo Neruda even read at the
CafÈ. We were all there because of the poetry, and it was all poetry.

The Nuyorican Movement set an alliance with the Royal Chicano Air Force,
and we became honorary members, because the Chicano and the Nuyorican
Movements are the same. We all suffer the same destiny and the same
experience. Weíve both had our land stolen from us, our culture stolen
from us. Once you have a movement, you have all these other people who
want to also make history, and they start their own movements. We just
needed a cultural outlet. Spanglish is not an indication of an inferior
mind, but it is an indication of an imagination that should be
completely fertile. You got to be brilliant, not dumb! Everybody had a
different outlook, and that was good. We werenít competing against each
other. We were just sharing the interpretation of what this cultural
dynamic should define. We were making history and didnít know it at the
time, and sometimes we shouldíve known it. But now? Everybody knows
about the Nuyorican Poets CafÈ. I went to California, San Francisco,
Chicago an
 d everywhere Iíve been, the Nuyorican experience is still spoken about
and highly praised. So, that is what this movement is about. And
thirty-five years later, to let you know, it was and still is a
phenomenon.

Weíre still together writing poetry. Weíre still not trying to impress
anybody, and too, you have new generations of poetry. You have the
Welfare Poets and Mariposa Fernandez. Thereís people that come up to us
and say, ëYou invented us.í So, whereís the movement now? Itís where it
began. Itís flourishing, and thatís futuristic.

They gave me a life sentence at Bronx-Lebanon. They sentenced me to my
death, and the sad thing about it is that there are many patients there
that donít have any options. You get a month to live in and thatís it,
they close the pieces and then they start radiating you, and the
radiation could kill you quicker. I told the guy, ëYou know, you should
get some radiation yourself, ëcause you donít look too good to me.í I
told him, ëYou get some radiation and if it works, then I might do it.í
So, they released me from the hospital and sent me home to die. But I
refuse to die, because my destiny is a decision that only I can be
solely responsible for making, and that was it. That was the first and
last time I went there.

I want to get better. I am getting better, but not by following orders.
I have to do my own thing. So, Papo found a place out here thatís nice.
Itís private, they speak my language, and itís legal to smoke whatever
treatments you need to get the message across to that part of your
spirit that conveys you to that territory of your soul, and in no time,
you will be outta here. Thereís no end to the phenomenon, The First
Draft Nuyorican Poetry Movement.

A couple of years ag ago Loss, Dave Chirot, and I conceived the idea of a
tribute to Philadelho Menezes. We got a number of good contributions but
dropped the ball and got o verwhelmed.  We are now trying to revive it and
would appreciate hearing from contributors so we can put together a table of

Hi everyone

I  know this is a long shot but I wonder if anybody has an email
contact (or any kind of contact) for playwright Robert Wilson ? I am
trying to contact him re permissions for a book I am writing and
contacting publishers about it has brought me to a dead end. If
anyone has any leads on this, or can suggest any, I would be most
grateful. I know the people on this list are terrific for supplying
information so I thought I would give it a try!
Best

Hazel

a heap because the body falls and in so doing
limbs keep moving, twitching
the body is invisible topography
only the topology remains
it shudders and goes to infinity
her arm shot out at a tangent
her neck collapsed her leg parted from the body
of the torso it retained its form momentarily

it all disappeared
inversion of dance technology, computer choreography:
let the machine do something
the topological organism becomes a warning beacon
the future of the body is radiation

i met his archivist at a party in brooklyn a couple of months
ago and he told me the truly incredible story of robert wilson's
rise to fame and fortune. apparently there was a moment in
the seventies when wilson was planning to stage an opera in
five or seven cities around the world simultaneously when,
just before it came off, the backer pulled the funding. robert
wilson was so angry and frustrated that he said, "never again
will i not have enough money to do any high budget art
project i want!" and ever since he's devoted himself to cozying
up to the very richest people in the world.
what was fascinating was the idea of an artist making the
choice to be as successful and famous as possible during his
lifetime, to devote all of his energy to bringing together
famous performers to carry out an artistic vision at the cost of
the artistic vision itself. in other words, screw artistic integrity,
i want to get rich. a perfectly valid choice, i think. it just
depends who you want to impress.
it's likely you know more about wilson than i do, but from
what i've seen - a couple of his summer performances in east
hampton, woyzeck at bam, some terrible operatic-autistic
thing at lincoln center a few years ago - he makes a kind of
high culture 'avant garde' soup for the bourgeoisie. i know, i
know einstein on the beach is really great...

anyway, one of this guy's archivist responsibilities was giving
permissions to people who write books about wilson. i don't
know his name but i do know that he worked out of an office
in soho, robert wilson's new york base. i bet you could get the
number by contacting the brooklyn academy of music or even
just calling information.

The poetics of babytalk

Some parents may think it is undignified or detrimental, but babytalk is
essential to the full development of a baby's brain, says a researcher at
the University of Alberta.

Babytalk, the universal cooing that mothers and fathers do to get their
babies' attention, is more important than we may have ever realized, says
Dr. David Miall, professor of English at the U of A.

Babytalk helps infants to develop an understanding and appreciation of
temporal arts, such as literature, music, and dance, and depriving babies
of the alliteration, assonance, and other poetic elements inherent in
babytalk could hinder their ability to produce and appreciate these arts
when they grow up, says Miall, whose research was published recently in the
journal Human Nature--An Interdisciplinary Biosocial Perspective.

"There has been little research done in this area. Most evolutionary
psychologists believe babytalk is simply related to a desire to develop a
baby's sense of attachment and affiliation, but we think it is much more
significant than that," Miall said.

Miall and his research colleague, Dr. Ellen Dissanayake, base their views
according to studies they did with a software program that Miall had
developed to recognize patterns in poetry. Miall found that babytalk
follows the same patterns often found in poetry that adults read.

"Babytalk is full of poetic features, such as metrics and phonetics," Miall
said. "I was surprised by how systematic it is, and how it works to shape
and direct attention."

Miall noticed, for example, that the sounds a parent makes when the baby is
focusing on the parent come from the high-front part of the mouth, which
indicates intimacy. Conversely, the sounds come from the low-back part of
the mouth when the parent is trying to win the baby's attention.

"There is a lot of evidence to show that an infant's mind is enormously
flexible and adaptive, and we feel that if a parent does not engage their
baby with babytalk it would be a loss, both cognitively and emotionally,
for the baby," Miall said.

Further, Miall contends that babytalk is evidence that humans' ability to
produce and appreciate art is not simply a means to help the artist find
sexual partners, as some evolutionary psychologists believe. Humans have
adapted the means to produce and appreciate art as a way to, among other
things, elevate, enrich, and educate one another, and babytalk is an
example of this, Miall says.

"Babytalk is an essential element of who and what we are," he adds. "And it
shows that literary art is not simply an ornament created for sexual
selection."

Philly is lousy with Gil Ott's death. Feel it from here, the slouch hat
hung low after measurable months of expectation. I am here imagining the

variant fluff piece in the paper, or the other paper, exposing the
absence, giving the news, posing the missing rather than defining what
he did. Doesn't he look well in this photo? Or should we use "the urban
poet in his environment" pose? Talking about what all else but the
subject.

Gil lumbered against the black puritan trees of Pennsylvania.  Every
single time I met him. If one could stoically breathe heavy he could.
After Paper Air ended,  he continued.  Few of his contemporaries did.
Gil had stones. Name another small press publisher who bothered
publishing plays. Who would have printed Harryette Mullen's  S*PeRM**K*?

Gil was a man who contributed.

Gil wrote prose. And always wore a trenchcoat. Often. Like this but
repetitively meditative. A harmonious tuning fork of wavelength. In the
way I wish I still had his books in moments like this. Especially Wheel.

Or any of the Singing Horse titles. Or the last manuscript he sent. But
such is not to be for the life of me ran otherwise. This the cost of
verse beforehand, the lost weight necessary to live. Recording and
speaking at once, a phone voice echoing through an answering machine.
Bye Gil, grateful to have caught an in depth transmission.



Be well

from the view of the beginning of the day may be read:

STIGMA and the problem of 'de-estrangement',

the target of certainty and of absolute truth and the
project of domination,

the passage from uncertainty to certainty, from ambivalence
to transparency,

no more than to construe the other world as that of our own
power, repression, purposeful action,

the refusal accepts the negative surface
formed by the definition and inhabits
that deformity - "(degraded, suppressed, exiled)" -
as its own - what belongs to it - an attibute or
trait belonging to the definition despite itself
- itself? - there is none - no - belonging
to what it is not
'to strike a blow'
'at the root'

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Unfortunately, my experiences at this store have been consistently negative.



The last time I went there, shortly after my reading at St. Mark's, I tried
to get the owner to carry IMPROVISATIONS. I waited patiently while she told
some young reporter how she served the poetry community, locating
hard-to-find books by little-know authors, etc. When they finished,I
introduced myself and said that I was giving a reading that evening at the
Harvard Coop, whereupon I received a tongue lashing for giving support to
Barnes & Noble, which seems to run most college bookstores these days. Since
my numerous attempts to find other readings in the Boston-Cambridge area met
with unreturned phone calls or cancellations without rescheduling, I was
simply going where someone would allow me to present my work. When I
countered by asking about reading in the Grolier Series, she dismissed my
suggestion emphatically.



The owner seemed to work harder at finding reasons not to carry my work than
at getting me to stay in the store to purchase anything. At times, she got
downright foul-mouthed. While I don't necessarily object to this, I question
whether she would have spoken to other visitors this way, and I refrained
from exercising my own special abilities in this area.



The owner then suggested I read my work in the Harvard Yard where, at the
time, students were protesting to raise the salaries of campus laborers.
When I passed through the yard I realized the protesters wanted diatonic
protest melodies and poems with readily accessible messages related to their
cause.



In sum, the woman berated me and misdirected me. Although I try to support
independent bookstores and small presses and "fight the good fight," I'm not
likely to be loyal when "one of my own" (?) in the poetry world "frags" and
"disses" me.



Too bad the young journalist didn't stay past his interview. He might have
found a more interesting story.



I decided Grolier did more to make me support amazon.com than her store and
haven't stepped inside since. I know at least one other Massachusetts-based
poet who boycotts the store for similar reasons.



I wrote to "Pat Holt Uncensored" about this incident and several independent
bookstores responded with shock.



I buy poetry whenever and wherever I can. Others can buy from Grolier. I
know a young man in Fort Lauderdale who's started an alternative bookstore,
Dissociated Books, that needs all the help it can get. He gets my dollar,
not Grolier.



Many of you may feel differently. But this was my experience at the, ahem,
bastion of poetry.

This is fascinating, and an intriguing bit of synchronicity, since I

Vernon, I never got inside the Grolier store.  At a conference last spring I
drove over but couldn't find a parking place in the Harvard Square area.  The
lots near the bookshop cost $8.50 per HALF hour and I knew I would need at least
two hours in the place just to indulge my curiosity, even before I bought
anything.  The parking isn't their fault, but 34 dollars just to have a look was
too daunting and I drove on in a huff.  I would have liked to go in.  There's
probably a better way to park than in those incredibly overpriced stalls, but I
didn't know Boston well enough to find them, and didn't have time to find out
about them.  I have had many similar experiences with bookstore owners, though.
I think it takes a complete nut to run a bookstore these days when the internet
is killing them off so maybe only cantankerous tough people are continuing to
try it.  God bless the few that are nutty enough to continue to try.  There's
not a single bookstore within an hour of my house.  There is a barn of older
books (I love the place), but not one bookstore where you can check out new
books.  I often pretend I am in Groliers looking through the shelf items and
imagine finding signed editions stuffed into the stacks.  I do hope the place
survives long enough for me to pay a visit.

Grolier with lots of free parking--

 From what Louisa told me, she unfortunately hadn't bought lots of new
books for quite a while since her credit wasn't good enough with most
of the booksellers to be able to get them.  But on the upside, now it
has all kinds of one-of-a-kind poetry books donated by supporters.
It's very near the subway station.

Louisa can be very cranky but i love and respect her.  she hangs in
there.  the guy who owned it before her, gordon cairney (?) was
cranky too (with diff pet peeves; if he didn't like the looks of you
he wouldn't sell you a book etc), but everyone thought it was a
loveable trait in him.  sexism anybody?

I obsess about books and book stores. Some of my best friends are, have been,
booksellers.And they are all a little cranky. Understandably. Groliers is an
extraordinary place.  It's a tenuous existence, running a shop like Groliers.
Support it, damn it.  It will be unreplaceable once it is gone.

I'm puzzled by this too - weren't a lot of modernists famously depressed? Or
were they anti-modern modernists?  Or are all real modernists happy? Is it
anti-modern to get depressed in a Corbursier flatlet? Was Celan anti-modern,
and Blaise Cendrars, and Ezra Pound, and Virginia Woolf and HD and all those
others? Is Barry MacSweeney an anti-modern poet?  Is depression an aesthetic
condition?

I like the idea of 'depression' as an aesthetic condition.
To muddy the waters even more I am starting to think of an aesthetic
condition that I call 'verboten' in that in this post modern world some
topics like feelings are verboten according to many editors.  That is, if
you write about personal feelings be prepared for rejection?  Augie Highland
(editor of MAG http://www.theminimag.com/jan04/health/index.html) and I had
a phone discussion of this awhile back.

"Feeling" and the responses people have to it (including poetic responses)
are very complicated matters, so it's very hard to generalise.  I think that
feeling is not quite a "topic" in poetry, more a matter of a poem's being, a
quality of its material, inseparable from what it is, just as consciousness
is inseparable from feeling.  Like consciousness itself, its articulation
requires intelligence; I have never understood the judgement that says a if
a poem has emotional affect, it must therefore be a stupid ("sentimental")
poem. Of course there are dumb poems about feeling, lots of them; equally
there are lots of supposedly intelligent poems that lack the crucial
intelligence of feeling. Both poetics seem to me to be equally crippled.

A number of young writers I know are in open rebellion against the
assumption that intelligence and feeling are mutually exclusive, which
encourages me.

Actually, I don't think that depression is an aesthetic condition, it's just
depression.  But sometimes - not inevitably, unfortunately - I've noticed
that depression can be a fore-runner to writing.  Mandelstam called it
"pre-lyrical anxiety".

Well the place is REAL in a way that Amazon and B & N
never will be. Louisa's special nature has come up on
this list before and while gruff she has never been
less than charming to me, once giving me a 15%
discount on my lot of ten some books because I talked
a young lady into buying a book she was looking at,
another time giving me a free book (by Liz Waldner)
because I was looking longingly at a Joan Retallack
book that I wasn't going to buy. (She said, "maybe
this will help you make up your mind!" or something
like that)--

So stores run by real people are messy and your
experiences won't be out of a can--sometimes they are
gruff or sweet or rude or appalling--I choose that.

I think a federally funded study is in order -- Acceptance of bad manners at Grolier
Bookstore categorized by race, gender, and class and -- time of day -- and according
to whether client had the sense to take the subway or parked in an overpriced lot.
It would take several years to do the study and then there would have to be outside
review of the study.  I have many times not gone back when dealing with male
grumpiness (a bookstore in Helsinki Finland) and also one in my home town of
Stroudsburg.  I actually have never run into an impolite female bookstore owner.
Perhaps I could get a grant to go to this store, and be offended, and then write up
my perceptions.   But the owner at Grolier would have to be exactly as rude to each
incoming person in order to provide a consistent standard of rudeness.  She'd have
to give each person the finger for instance and say, fuck no you can't have a book
get out.  I could also take offers from interested parties to skew my perceptions
toward anyone with deep enough pockets.  I could say I loved the experience.  But
until I saw it myself, I would not agree.  There is way too much crying wolf on this
sexism issue, Maria.  there might be other explanations.  REasons not to go to
Grolier.  So far there are two:

1.  Grumpy owner
2.  No parking

And there are two good reasons:

1.  It's a sexist thing not to
2.  The place is a cultural treasure

And there is a remedy for bad reason # 2 -- take the subway.

There are very few good bookstores like this left.  In Seattle there's a great
poetry bookstore up in the Wallingford area.  Can't remember the name of it.  It's
run by a couple, or at least it was.  They also run a journal called Fine Madness.
All my names in Seattle are disappearing.  Is there a book somewhere that lists all
poetry- only bookstores in America?  I imagine that there are very few.  Maybe less
than five?  Is there such a thing anywhere in the Manhattan area?  There's a good
poetry bookstore in Woodstock NY -- well, it's not all poetry but you often get
signed editions at the regular price because lots of poets live around there.  I got
a Kenneth Koch book that was signed there just before his death.  The bookstore is
called Golden Notebook if you're passing through.

I agree wholly with the notion of expression of feeling being closed off
from 'modernism' is a false path but I am reluctant to take on words like
'depression' as explanations. I know what depression is but it is not just
what I suffer from, depression means a lowering, it happens, yes, just as
the weather turns bad, but heightenings, moments of elation, can cause just
as much trouble. This does not mean 'mad', 'manic-depressive' etc as token
labels, in my own case it tends to be acts of minor silliness, yesterday,
although broke, I suddenly decided to buy a didgeridoo off a musician friend
of mine, I hope this gives Alison a smile, although I can't play one, I went
into the local pub on the way back with it on my shoulder and it created a
great impression but afterwards I did wonder whether I was going bonkers
but, a big BUT, my consideration is that creativity is allied to something
close to Mandelstam's 'pre-lyrical anxiety' but what I would rather term
'precariousness' as the Osip M. term is too closely tied to an event, rather
than a permanent condition of being.

I do, though, understand that Dante acted as if he was happy in the last
years of his life, so maybe there's hope for us all.

i don't know to what extent we can identify depression with "pre-lyrical
anxiety". | depression seems to be characterized more by the absence of
desire, a feeling of fatigue, disinterest, etc. |  in what sense is it
related to creativity?|  i don't see it as a state immediately =
associated
with writerly fertility. | yet (speaking along the lines of intersection =
of
intelligence & affectivity -- which is not, of course, a particularly =
new
notion), i would adopt pierre f=E9dida's formulation who sees depression =
as a
"form of knowledge" {pierre f=E9dida is a french psychoanalyst who =
recently
passed away; one of his last books was devoted to the "bienfaits de la
depression: l'=E9loge de la psychoth=E9rapie" (odile jacob, 2001; =
2003)}.
what does it mean for me to write "out of depression"? | it is rather
writing _against_ it. in a state of emptiness & utter dissolution, to =
force
oneself into words, and in words (or, in any other form of expression), =
as
if artificially pull oneself out of... well, out of oneself. | =
depression is
that sort of state of centripetal collapse (a psychic black hole), into =
a
narrowing circle of recurring thoughts (actually, nietzsche's notion of =
the
eternal recurrence of the same is, at once, an expression of it & a way =
out
of it: in nietzsche's embracing of the idea which goes beyond mere
resignation to it -- and i say this, of course, without trying to reduce
what i abbreviate as e.r.o.s., to a depressive state). somehow, one =
finds
anchor in language: words refuse to yield to this collapsing & by =
writing, i
make my way out of depression (the image of zarathustra laboriously =
climbing
the mountain, with the grave spirit of a dwarf growing on his shoulder =
as he
approaches the double faced gateway, the moment, is very vivid for me =
here).
| writing allows me to look at myself as if from outside; language plays
with me and offers a sort of distance of rescue, turns the gravity of
depression into a word-play.
so this, briefly, would be how i view depression's relation to =
creativity --
in terms of _how_ writing is done.
to pick up f=E9dida's expression, then (& perhaps also nietzsche's idea =
that
depression is, not merely an illness, a malady, but, if we accept that =
term,
a "human malady" par excellence) depression can be seen as affecting the
_what_ of writing. as a way of relating to the world (look, let's say, =
at de
chirico's paintings), depression shapes our thinking: and that, perhaps,
would be its most fertile arena.
i cannot pronounce on modernity or anti-modernity of depression, apart =
from
reminding, as others have already, that, after all, depression has been
commonly considered our "maladie du si=E8cle"... | if genetic research =
or
pharmaceutical progress does much to eliminate it, it trivializes it =
perhaps
at the same time: be it an illness, it isn't quite like flu. what =
nietzsche
meant, perhaps, by calling it a "human illness", without fetishizing it =
or
calling it a _necessary_ attribute of one's humanity, was to =
acknowledge,
nevertheless, a certain opening it offers into one's knowledge (of =
oneself,
hence, of the human).

Tom - I agree here - not only are there many kinds of depression, but
depression itself tends to be a catch-all for a number of different
manifestations of symptoms, some of which may be related to varying causes -
nutrition, biological disposition, trauma, illness and so on. Clinical
depression may not even present as anything the individual clearly
identifies as depression - it might be mostly characterized by fatigue, for
instance - whereas other individuals might be extremely weepy - and others
might be suicidal; however, it's not all a continuum, and due to the
complexity of human biology and psychology and the interactions between, the
causes and reasons may differ greatly between persons. So - that's sort of
what I understand of depression - kind of like how at one time various
respiratory ailments were all termed "consumption" but with medical progress
these came to be identified as various cancers, tuberculosis, emphysema,
etc. :: the appearance of the illness termed "depression" might seem similar
between different persons, but might have entirely different causes and
solutions depending on that person.

Though stockes more than poetry, Bridge Street Books
in D.C. is a superb spot for poetry. And the folks
that run it have great tempers.

Hi all,

Last August I started a new reading series, "d.a. levy lives: celebrating the
renegade press in america," at ACA Galleries in Chelsea. Each month we have a
different non-NY based small press run the night, with them picking the readers
and the music (if they don't know any musicians who can take part, I help out
on that front).

Already we've hosted Meritage Press (San Francisco), The Owl Press (Woodacre,
Calif.), Tougher Disguises Press (Oakland, Calif.), CyPress (Cincinnati, Ohio),
above/ground press (Ottawa, Ontario), and, this past week, Chax Press (Tucson,
Ariz.) held a 20th anniversary event as part of our series. Forthcoming through
July are Carve magazine (Boston), Braincase Press (Northampton, Mass.), Oasis
Press (Athens, Ohio), Combo (Providence, R.I.), and Talonbooks (Vancouver,
B.C.).

Our first season winds up this July, and the gallery owners and I have decided
to extend the series for at least another year. The second season will kick off
in August when I'll hold a Boog 13th anniversary party there, with NY-based
small press editors taking part (this is the one month when I honor my local
compatriots). This leaves September 2004-July 2005 open (readings are first
Thursday of the month). If you’re interested in having your press take part,
please email editor@boogcity.com

as ever,
David

Those interested in experimental music might want to check out
?Twentieth-Century Classics? every Sunday 8-12 pm CST, hosted alternate
weeks by Brian & Angela on Tulane University?s WTUL. Recent playlists
include works by Steve Reich, Harry Partch, Einojuhani Rautavaara, Matt
Haimovitz, etc. You can hear it live online at
http://www.tulane.edu/~wtul/listen.html.

I?d love to know of any other music or poetry radio programs of interest,
especially those on stations that netcast. For example, there?s Kenny
Goldsmith?s weekly WFMU show ?Anal Magic? Wednesdays 3-6 EST at
www.wfmu.org

Any others?

Granted, it's a shame that an independent poetry bookstore is almost certainly
going to be replaced by a crappy chain or another stupid hair salon or jewelry
store.

However, it's also a shame that the owner of said bookstore manages to alienate
just about everyone who comes in by demanding to search their belongings; being
hostile to browsers who don't know what they want; and just generally being
rude. I can only think of a few people I know around here who shop there,
because everyone else is tired of being harrassed by Louisa. (& on the subject
of sexism, I will only point out that the few people I've met who have said
"I've never had a problem with Louisa" have all been women.)

I should disclose that I used to work there (for two weeks in April of 2001) &
in that short time got a look into the warped mind of the owner. I was let go
at the beginning of my third day (it was 6 hrs/wk) & never looked back. Also
have not been in since.

Anyway, it disturbs me when small businesses complain about lack of customers
without considering all the possibilities for that lack. I will miss the
Grolier; I will not miss Louisa.

Aaron

Aaron Tieger, thanks so much for this input.

The bookstore owner that I could least understand was a man from New York city who
had moved to Helsinki Finland in his retirement and opened an amazingly
well-stocked bookstore in an area near Kalliokirkko if that was the name.  The guy
didn't have prices in the damned books, so you had to take them up to the desk and
he would look through, look you over, and then charge you whatever he felt like.
It was an embarrassing, and humiliating experience.  My wife went through the line
and he charged her much less than the prices he was going to give to me for the
same books (we tried this as an experiment).  I am quite timid in person especially
with strangers (email is a very good format for me because I can barely speak when
I actually meet people but in this medium I have discovered I can say almost
anything I like!) so this bookstore drove me out of my mind.  Really all that
customers like myself want is minimal hassle -- I don't want to talk to bookstore
personnel.  The worst of all is clothing stores.  My heavens -- I go into one of
those every two years and just hate it!  And if somebody talks to me I am
completely driven out of my mind by it.  I like to snoop around, get something that
is a close approximation, and get the heck out, not have to meet somebody or have
conversation, or haggle over prices for heaven's sake.  And I can't stand somebody
approaching me in a clothing store with a tape measure and a pencil behind their
ear.  Thank heavens for the internet.  I get all my clothes now through the
internet, and should just send back the ones that don't fit, but am usually too
alarmed to do that so just pile them in a corner and eventually take them to
Salvation Army.

So I never went back into that bookshop in Helsinki, in spite of often cruising by
and wondering if I dared to go in..

Maria -- I am also v fond of you in spite of no-see for 25 years but shopping is a
different experience for men than it is for women.  You know that phrase, when the
going gets tough, the tough go shopping.  I think the tough in this case are all
women.  Correct me if I am wrong here people, but shopping is a terrible,
humiliating experience for most men, and even the slightest ill look from store
personnel, and we turn to the internet.

Still, I do admire anybody who tries to have a bookstore.  I do love to go deep
into the stacks and browse, especially if the place smells decently, and I am
allowed to open books and see what's around and the lights aren't too bright.  A
good bookstore can easily take a grand a year out of me (Silliman's approximation
in his recent blog) if they will just leave me alone -- no unnecessary dawdling at
the counter while I buy the book with a buy-twelve get one free punch card or
anything like that.  Gee whiz.  That's too much contact.  Once at Gotham Book Mart
a very big guy with blonde hair who was the buyer started speaking to me and I
actually couldn't get any words out of my mouth.

Pure panic.  I wonder if he thought that was weird.

I think women have it made, Maria.  Just my pov, but in terms of shopping, it seems
to me that women really function.  Maybe gay men are tougher than straight men,
too, for some reason, at least on this topic.  They also love to shop, it seems,
especially for clothes.  I have watched this gay guy with the straight eye or
something once and those guys just love shopping or so it seems.  I can't believe
that there is a single straight man who isn't completely panicked by clothes
shopping.

So I think that bookstore owners should have the qualities of colorful tropical
fish, and its a shame that they sometimes don't.  I suppose we have to live with
that.  Internet booksales exceed store-bought books by 7 to 1 I was told by someone
recently who was disgusted by it.  I do still prefer bookstores because I like to
see the actual print size (I need large print, or I won't read the book), and I
won't read books that smell of cigarettes or must, so often have to throw away
books that come through the internet used, and try again.  In the store you can
check these details out.

WORKSHOPS

Revising Poems For Publication with Michael Kelleher
Three Thursdays Left February, 12, 19, 26 7-9 p.m. $70, $60 for members

All poets revise. Those that tell you otherwise are usually spinning myths of their brilliance to dazzle you. One of the most difficult things for poets to do is learn to read their work as editors.  The time and effort it takes to write a poem often overshadow the need for revision, or the need for several revisions, before a poem is ready to be published.

This 4-week workshop will focus on revision as a practice, helping poets devise strategies for revising poems effectively for publication.  We will look at revisions in manuscript form by other poets work to see how they revise, and talk about the various decisions one needs to make in order to decide what stays, what goes, and what needs to be added to make a poem complete.

We will also discuss how to research journals for publication, how to recognize which journals are more likely to select your work, how to write a cover letter, and how to format poems for submission.

Michael Kelleher has published three chapbooks: Cuba (Phylum 2002); Bacchanalia (Quinella: Three Poems Series: 1999); and The Necessary Elephant (Ota Molloy 1998). Editor of Artvoice's "The Word" column, as well as the artist book/poets press, ELEVATOR, he is the Artistic Director for Just Buffalo.

So You Say You Can't Write Poetry? with Marj Hahne
Six Wednesdays, March 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, and April 7 7 - 9 p.m.; $150, $125 for members

As children we were natural poets, but by adulthood, we likely suppressed some of the sensibilities that enliven our reading and writing of poetry: (1) a fascination with wordplay and the infinite possibilities of language, (2) an alert sensory perception, (3) recognition and acceptance of our unique voice, and (4) patience with our learning process.

Designed for the beginning or tentative poet (although practiced poets will find it enriching, too!), this educational and fun workshop will present accessible poetic forms, sample poems, and prompts as structures that allow for the possibility of poetry as we uncover or recover our individual poetic voices.  We will create a safe space for generating lots of original writing while attending to the particulars of craft: language choices, the poem's shape, and various poetic devices.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist from New York City.  Her work has appeared in Painted Bride Quarterly, Mad Poets Reviews, La Petite Zine, Rogue Scholars, & New England Writer's Network.  She also has a CD entitled, notspeak.

How to Write and Sell Essays, Short Stories, Travel and Feature Articles with Kathryn Radeff

4 Saturdays, March 6, 13, 20, 27 10-12 a.m. $135, $110 for members

The magazine field is overflowing with opportunity. With the right approach you can craft articles, sell and re-sell to worldwide publications. Open to everyone, this four-week special workshop focuses on the fundamentals editors are looking for and presents the secret to writing great marketing letters. Through in-class and at-home exercises, Kathryn Radeff provides a fun, effective, and motivational workshop designed to inspire the writer and develop creative confidence. The workshop also includes creative self-promotion methods and the business end of publishing. It is recommended that you purchase the four guidebooks from the "You Can Be A Working Writer" series at $5.95 each.

If All Of Buffalo Read The Same Book

Just Buffalo Literary Center has chosen The God of Small Things, by Arundhati Roy, as the centerpiece of its 4th If All Buffalo Read The Same Book program, which will culminate in a two-day author's visit on September 8-9, 2004. The God of Small Things won the 1997 Booker Prize for literature, Great Britain's highest literary honor. Arundhati Roy became the first non-expatriate Indian author and the first Indian woman to win the award. The New York Times called the book "dazzling" and "remarkable," while the Washington post noted, "It's hard to avoid using words like 'splendid' and 'stunning' to describe this debut novel."

Media, book clubs, organizations, educators, public officials and individuals who would like more information or a reader's guide, as well as those interested in sponsorship, can contact Just Buffalo at 832-5400 or by writing info@justbuffalo.org.

Amid all the accusations, it's nice to see someone mention the great Bridge
Street Books in DC.  My favorite bookstore and my favorite poet working in a
bookstore too (Rod Smith).  Fantastic person, terrific poet (see Ron's blog
about a month ago), generous to a fault without any grumpiness to be excused.
Great to the POETICS list and also great in person.  Thanks Rod.

at last, something we can agree on, kirby!  actually, i hate clothing
shopping too, unless i'm w someone who really knows how to shop and
can be efficient in telling me what to get and what not to get.  i
have had some b-friends who are excellent at this, as well as gay and
straight male friends and female friends, tho' the female friends are
not so efficient.  in bookstores i like browsing; in clothing stores
it's an embarrassing, humiliating experience. and trying things on
--arghhh!  i can count on one hand the positive clothes-shopping
experiences i've had.  but those can indeed be v good. the internet
doesn't work for me, because fit is so important; and catalogue
shopping same thing, unless you just find the right size/cut/brand of
something you will need multiples of over the years and that will
likely always be in stock, like llbean's petite size 8 relaxed fit
blue jeans (the black ones fit completely differently).  i never
trust that the sales women in retail stores are telling me the truth
--too eager to sell something, i imagine. so i do most of my shopping
at yard sales, thrift shops and the back alleys after huge
neighborhood-wide garage sale weekends. or i inherit handmedowns from
my friends.  and my sister is an ace shopper, so she is responsible
for some of the staples in my wardrobe.

come to think of it, bookstores can be overwhelming too, in a
different way. i get sugar highs in city lights and have to stagger
out after just a few minutes...

I'm interested in the dialogue, just a lot on my plate right now.  And my
perspective on depression (anxiety or worry induced depression, which made
things the more confusing) is from the inside, so it is anecdotal and
lyrical, rather based on social science research.  But I am interested, so
let me know.

Subject:      Soft Skull, says Wall St. Jrnl,
              is "putting out books that other publishers avoid like ricin"
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Last Friday, the Wall Street Journal published a column by one of its senior editorial page writers decrying Soft Skull Press for publishing a revised edition of Michael Bellesiles's Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture, suggesting that "Soft Skull Press...takes pride in putting out books other publishers avoid like ricin." While we are tempted to take that designation with pride, coming as it does from the most prominent organ of right-wing thought in the United States, it behooves us not to smugly accept that appellation in the matter of this particular title. We must actively defend this book.

We published this revised edition because we believe that Arming America constitutes an important step in the development of our thinking about the origins of gun violence in America and because we fear, rightly, that it is threatened. The conventional wisdom is that this book is so flawed as to be worthless but, as the UC Irvine historian Jon Wiener has written "[I]nstead of focusing on the book's thesis or claims made about its contemporary significance, [the Right's] strategy has been to try to discredit it by focusing attention on errors in a tiny portion of the documentation. It's an old tactic, and an illogical one--the book could be wrong about the origins of our present gun culture even if its footnotes are flawless. But the tactic often works." Soft Skull Press refuses to submit to those tactics, not when many of America's librarians are still be pressured to remove the book from their collections, not when the assault weapons ban will clearly not be renewed, not whe
n academic freedom is under threat.

But since The Wall Street Journal is again employing the tactic to discredit our revised edition (clearly, no amount of revision is going to satisfy Second Amendment absolutists), we feel it is important to notify everyone we can that this book is not going to go away.

Below you will find the full text of The Wall Street Journal's column, and the full text of Jon Wiener's earlier article from the Organization of American Historians newsletter. Please contact us at for a copy of "Weighed in an Even Balance," Bellesiles' pamphlet on what changes he did, and did not, make to the revised edition, and why...Or you may download it by clicking here: http://www.softskull.com/files/weighed_even_balance.pdf   Please us also contact for a review copy of Arming America, and for any information you might need.

Dear all poets, artists, writers and activists:

Hello !
I hope that you will join us on Thursday Feb 12th from 12noon to 2pm on the
front steps of The New York Public Library to read poems and speak the truth
about our present government.
We have organized this reading to coincide with the 1 year anniversary of
poets against the war. To learn more about this group check out their website
www.poetsagainstthewar.org.
I have spoken with many of you and understand that weekdays can be difficult
to attend. If you can break free from your schedule for long enough to read
that would be great !
If we are few or many this is not really so important. What is important is
that we are visible, on the streets of New York City, meeting and serving
witness to the fact that we the people will guarantee our own freedom of speech and
peaceful protest !
I have read here before and can tell you that this is a powerful experience
bringing poems directly to people in the street.

Thank you in advance for your support !

Sincerely,

Nathaniel
poets for Peace
poets against the war
POETRY IS NEWS

PS: please let me know if you will attend and I will send out a list of
confirmed readers

this reading is open to ALL !

There is no rush on this.  I've got a couple of months of a stuff to get
out, already.  The inside view is what is important, so let me know when you
are ready to dialog.

<http://www.petescandystore.com>

Drunken Boat, online journal for the arts  <http://www.drunkenboat.com>, =
kicks off Issue#6 with a multimedia extravaganza, featuring poets Andrea =
Baker, Benjamin Gantcher, Brian Kim Stefans, and sound artists Latasha =
Natasha Diggs and Cary Peppermint.=20

Contact Ravi Shankar editor@drunkenboat.com or=20
(860) 832-2766 for more details.=20

PERFORMERS:=20

Andrea Baker's work is forthcoming or has recently appeared in Denver =
Quarterly, Fence, La Petite Zine, Lit, Vert, and Volt.  She is Poetry =
Editor at 3rd Bed and lives in Brooklyn, NY with her husband and son.

Benjamin Gantcher's poems have appeared in several journals and =
magazines, including Archipelago, Slate and Tin House, and are =
forthcoming in Grand Street.

Brian Kim Stefans has published several books and chapbooks of poetry, =
most recently Jai-lai for Autocrats (poems, Portable Press) and =
Fashionable Noise: On Digital Poetics (Atelos Books), a miscellany of =
interviews, poems and poetics.  His essay on the political blog he =
created and co-edited called Circulars (http://www.arras.net/circulars/) =
is forthcoming in a book by MIT Press later this year.  He runs =
arras.net, devoted to new media poetry and poetics.

Writer and vocalist, Latasha N. Nevada Diggs' literary and sound works =
have been published and recorded in various publications and for music =
projects ranging from rock to house. She is the author of two =
chap-books, Ichi-Ban: from the files of negr=EDta mu=F1eca linda and =
Ni-ban: Villa Miser=EDa and the producer and writer for the conceptual =
audio project, Televis=EDon.  A fellow of the Cave Canem Workshop for =
African American Poets, she is a 2002 Harvestworks Digital Media Arts =
artist in residence, a 2003 Zora Neale Hurston recipient from Naropa =
Institute, and a 2003 New York Foundation for the Arts fellow.  She is =
also the lead electronic vocalist for the Zappa-esque jam band, Yohimbe =
Brothers, fronted by Vernon Reid and DJ Logic. She lives in Harlem.

Cary Peppermint is a performance artist involved with immersive =
environments of convergent media. His work flows through organic and new =
media technologies, incorporating live performance, interactive =
installations, experimental music, and the internet.  At the most basic =
level, Peppermint's works are concerned with mediation and the reduction =
of space and time. Peppermint's works comprise some of the first =
real-time, interactive performance art realized via the internet =
including "The Mashed Potato Supper" conceived in 1995 as part of =
Edinburgh's Fringe Film and Video Festival OE96 and "Conductor Number =
One" included in "PORT: Navigating Digital Culture" at MIT List Visual =
Arts Center in 1996. Peppermint lives in New York where he releases work =

tom,

i think a polyphonic dialogue -- and here to reference robert's email --
that would consider depression (and yes, in its different forms -- for after
all, even within psychiatry, the term must always be modified) from "lyrical
/ anecdotal" point of view would be very interesting. i am definitely not
competent to speak of depression in any authoritative manner: i am a lit
student, attracted to different melancholy poets (and here, again, creeps in
a "synonym" adding to the imprecision) & writers such as Cioran (who,
interestingly, in his private life was of quite cheerful disposition --
someone who really _wrote his depressions out_), etc.

let me know how you imagine this.

best est,

ela k.

Clinically, "depression" is typically seen as the absence of feeling rather
than it being a feeling in itself.  It is this absence that medication
treats.  There are, of course, many kinds of depression both clinically and
in literature

I very carefully wasn't making them synonyms.  But in my experience, and
commonly among other people I know or who have read, something akin enough
to depression - a period of lassitude, apathy, disinterest, anxiety,
self-absence - can precede the commencement of work.  There is another
definition of depression (I don't know from which source) which holds that
depression is not "a form of knowledge" but "withheld knowledge" (which
might count in the former definition as a kind of negative theology).  That
withheld knowledge might be - and here I am of course speculating, but
aren't we all? - a thoughtform not quite articulate, not quite gestated, but
present enough to cause a kind of psychic pressure.  I guess it seems to me
that rather than being a countersurge against depression, depression might
be, in some cases, part of the cycle of artistic creation, a kind of dark
cloud of unknowing that you have to get through to evolve the work.

Hi Steve

        One of the classics on language acquisition was Roger Brown's A First
Language, The Early Stages.  Brown established five stages of growth on
the basis of the acquisition of key morphemes and is always fun to read.
But that book is somewhat outdated and you might want to look at Beyond
Baby Talk, From Sounds to Sentences (A Parent's Guide) by Ken Apel & Judy
Masterson (both Speech-Language Pathologists) or Peter Jusczyk's The
Disovery of Spoken Language (MIT 1997), as well as Paul Bloom's (ed.)
Language Acquisition, Core Readings (MIT 1994).
        I don't think Piaget will be of much help; his studies involve later
intellectual growth and have come under heavy fire.  But you also might
take a look at the following.

(1) Margery Franklin & Sybil Barten, eds. Child Language, A Reader
(Oxford UP 1988)
(2) Melissa Bowerman & Stephen Levinson, eds.  Language Acquisition and
Conceptual Development (Cambridge UP 2001)
(3) Marilyn Vihman, Phonological Development, The Origins of Language in
the Child (Blackwell 1996)

Tho this last title is probably too technical.  Hope this helps,

Bruce Holsapple

Subject:      Notes on codework
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

A few notes on codework for an upcoming
talk -


A difficulty I have with codework discussions - codework is usually taken
as pseudo-code or broken or dysfunctional code somehow pasted onto or into
a work - as if that would give the work credence, legitimize the text as
literature etc. But nothing is farther from the truth. (Mez for example
isn't broken code but displacement/insertion techniques - shifters,
slippages, of language that are semantically marked.)

In general -

please note it is not the code that is broken - but the interiorities of
more or less traditional semantic worlds - sememes as well (in other
words, distortions of world-making).

what is code in the first place ? - obviously it can either be a PROGRAM
which PRODUCES a residue - or it can be a CARRIER of meaning. this depends
on the semiotic encodings as well as the PERFORMATIVITIES at work. a code
may or may perform - in the sense that it may or may not create a result
that one might characterize ontologically and/or epistemologically as AN
OTHER.

again - think of code - in the sense of morse code - as a _mapping_
between two or more strata. think of code - in the sense of programming -
as a _performative_ between one stratum (that of base more or less
sequentially accessed) and another (that of residue or results which may
or may not appear dynamic or interactive). (see Eco, Theory of Semiotics.)

the POLITICAL economy of a text, performative, or performance in relation
to the OTHER that appears.

CODE / PSEUDO-CODE ETC. IN CODEWORK

0 Texts which problematize the relationships among language, subjectivity,
symbol, meaning, body, organism - texts which take nothing for granted.

1 Texts which are literally performative.

2 Texts which are program output. Here we might distinguish between texts
which are sutured in relation to the _standard text_ - and texts whose
content and form clearly reflects both programming and program
_interference._

3 Texts which in part present the programs or controls that have created
the remainder - for example a text which might include k:1 banner as part
of the content - an ascii banner.

4 Texts which are clearly modified in their entirety - for example vowel
substitutions, formations using awk, grep, sed, tr, etc.

5 Texts which present a _history_ or series of operations - texts which
appear to require reconstitution or recuperation - these may or may not be
accompanied by their _history of transformations._

6 Likewise texts which are incapable of such reconstitution or
recuperation.

7 Texts with content 'picked up' and placed against other content (for
example spam text interspersed with other text) in order to expand or
render a sememe problematic.

8 Texts which rely on and relay through distributivities such as SMS,
email lists, IRC, etc., as a means of dispersion, engagement,
intervention, political or other action, etc. And texts which report back
on these texts.

9 Texts working from MOOs, MOO language, MUDs, and so forth - texts
generated in chatrooms with one, some, or all characters under the control
of the 'author' or 'author-collaborators.'

10 Texts which are reportage from commands, such as traceroute or dig or
@lastlog or Kismet output - texts which examine the network and its
tethering.

11 Traditional texts, traditionally-written texts which report on other
texts, other codeworks, which mimic codeworks, and so forth.

12 Not to mention all those aleatoric texts, stochastic or chaotic texts
or imagery, multi-media codeworks, generative works, generative works fed
into themselves (resonance-work), specialized editors which refuse the
WYSIWYG...

Note on "Codework"


I think I came up with the name (which surely had been used before) in a
conversation with Ken Wark - we were talking about code - the term at that
point, as far as I remember, was code-poetry - and I borrowed the notion
of 'work' - i.e. labor, production - I think - from Heiner Muller -
running the two words together - as in Hamletmachine - so there was a
political component as well - not wanting the limitation of poetry,
however defined, or poetics for that matter - opening the framework, not
closing it - I'd also felt that code-poetry - however spelled - was too
close to concrete poetry - which didn't interest me at all - at least not
any longer - not even dom sylvester huedard - maybe huedard actually - but
not the usual suspects - anyway - I thought that codepoetry would minimize
the design aspect - emphasize the symbolic or asymbolic or presymbolic -
for that matter the (Kristevan) choratic of language - so the political
and psychoanalytical met on the grounds of mathesis and semiosis - all
this into the naming of the word - pretty commonplace now - at least this
is what was going through my mind at that point - still is - anyway -

Excellent thoughts, Alan.  The kind of thing I wish
there were more of at this site.

My argument with "codework" remains the same: "code"
is necessarily computer code.  I do codeworks that
have nothing to do with computers.  Here's my horrible
but more appropriate suggested term: "cyberlangwork."
I'd call "Cyberlang Poetry" a branch of "cryptographic
poetry."  I know, no one else would or will.

There is also a good book by Steven Pinker on Language Acquisition, as well
as some information on the subject in his more popular books, The Language
Instinct and Rules and Words.

Maria, I was trying to out-marginalize you on at least one issue, but geez, you
hugged the post and got in front of me again.  Darn it!  I mean I do at least go to
those clothing shops by myself rather than drag in the competent people. You just
drag in all kinds of competent people in order to emphasize the difference.

But it was fun to sort of agree on at least the difficulty of shopping for clothes..

I love that all the can-do actors like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis and
Mel Gibson and Charlton Heston and Chuck Norris and so on -- such rough independent
muscle fellers are backing Bush, while goofballs like Barbara Streisand are backing
whomsoever the Demos put up.

I'm actually fairly functional.  But I have my lapses -- clothing stores are a place
that brings out something -- a sort of impatience bordering on pure dysfunctionality
-- and bookstores -- I get so involved with looking at the books that if somebody
speaks to me I simply can't respond sometimes.  But ordinarily I'm fairly
functional.  I exercise and can beat most people my age at sports.

If any young people are reading this -- try to be just functional.  It's almost
impossible these days to out-dysfunctional anybody in the left.  They have mastered
the art to the point that there is simply no way to beat them.  Hats off to you once
more, Maria.  I think it's so much easier to just figure out how to be functional --
I'm going to raise my boys to be as much like Bruce Willis as I can manage.
Starting out with the weight room tomorrow morning.  It's actually less effort in
the long run to just be happy and independent and deal with the cantankerous
bookstore owners.  Mr. Nudel, I have a lot of signed copies of Beat books and
surrealist French books.  Let's make a deal.

We hope you can join us on Saturday, February 14 at 7:30 p.m. for the next reading in the Ruthless Grip Poetry Series at Washington Printmakers Gallery (1732 Connecticut Ave., second floor, on Connecticut between  R and S, several blocks north of the Dupont Circle Q Street metro  exit), featuring BETSY FAGIN and MARIANA RUIZ FIRMAT and with special guest host Buck Downs.

BETSY FAGIN's poems appear in a number of literary journals including Five Fingers Review, Fence, Skanky Possum, So to Speak, Torch, and The World among others. She is the author of For Every Solution There is a Problem (Open 24 Hours). Recent work appears in Pom2 and Van Gogh's Ear. Betsy's poems lead us lurking through halls of knowledge and activity, to find unclaimed turf where the music of space can be clearly heard.

MARIANA RUIZ FIRMAT lives in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Mariana has lived in New York for four years and before that lived in Santa Cruz, California where she met fellow poet Brenda Bordofsky. She works for a progressive foundation in New York and for Hunter College developing a violence against women curriculum for high school youth. She is a member of national INCITE! where she is trying to connect the political with the poetic. Mariana has been published in 6x6, Tool A Magazine and POep. Her chapbook, Another Strange Island was published in 2003 by Open 24 Hours Books. Mariana zigzags through a tidal surge of idea and image in her poems, and their surfaces glint with a crystalline salt.

 It's not much of a poem...and i don't really want to
bore folk with discussing it...in my academic yrs..
i would have let it stand..rather fall... for itself..but...

 As you might have noticed i have an unlimited
store of resentments..i had nothing against Spalding..
except in 25 years of standing outside..he never managed
to either buy a book or come by...he lived one block away..
he was the ultimo type..of looking for enlightenment..
anywhere but where he was...air lang ports poets...the New York
School's fame has yet to spread to Besonhurst..

  The Mthr Sd..is certainly a reference...to the Mthr Sd poet
who has also been quite ill recently...i wish him well..but
i won't get into it...etc..

  My mother when i was little..when i sd i was bored..
used to tell me two things...(both in Yiddish)....go play
in traffic..and go jump in the lake (yam)...

  My S.O...sd it was gratuitously vicious..and i'd agree...harry...

Subject:      Codework impossibility of self-reference and decipherment.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Codework impossibility of self-reference and decipherment.


a. "There are seven words in this sentence." Which word is the number?
b. "This is a sentence." But how would one know?
c. "This is written in English." But how would one know?
etc.

- Self-referentiality possesses a residue; only in mathematics or logic is
it 'pure' - the whole relating to the whole.

The residue is in relation to an attribute. But then

d. "This refers in its entirety to itself." Are we at the juncture of
paradox?
etc.

Using Peirce's distinctions, I'd argue that every painting is first and
foremost ikonic and perceived as such - the paint is never transparent. To
the extent that codework requires interpretation, examination, it is
ikonic as well - one might say that, even in the space of virtuality, it
possesses a materialist foundation. The more 'impenetrable' the greater
the degree of ikonicity, the greater the appearance of _material._ This
appearance is just that, however, appearance, as a change - for example
from monospace to justifiable type - will demonstrate.

One must consider, of course, the semantic residue of the ikonic - and the
interstitial / liminal between the meaning-sememe and the ikonic provides
the _content_ of the work; in fact, the meaning-sememe and ikonic-sememe
are interwoven, inseparable, and contributory, a somewhat similar
situation to the calligraphic.

_Meaning_ itself is both attribute (i.e. 'meaning of _cheval_ in French')
and calligraphic; totality is reserved for the Absolute which is always
problematic ('meaning of Life,' 'meaning of Everything') and ideologically
suspect. To the extent that meaning embraces an Absolute, meaning depends
on decoding (Bible, Koran, Kwak!); here is the locus of political Power in
the Foucauldian sense.

Codework simultaneously embraces and problematizes meaning; one might
argue that codework is _fallen work,_ fallen by the wayside, as well as
the disturbance of the Gnostic Mary Magdalen.

Every more or less traditional text is codework with invisible residue;
every computer harbors the machinic, the ideology of capital in the
construction of its components, the oppression of underdevelopment in its
reliance on cheap labor.

Every text is Derridian/Foucauldian differance; codework is exemplary of
the process of deferral and _rewrite._ Codework, like _wryting,_ is an
embodiment within virtual ontologies; wryting disturbs _towards_ the body,
desire, language - that language of codework, ruptured by codework.

Inner speech as well is self-referential, a decoding of every text spoken
within it, before the reader, or among the readers. And nothing fulfills
_utterly,_ every Absolute itself is codework, a deferral - hence the
psychoanalytical nature of _defuge_ - that decay which comes about through
the overuse of pornography or the attempt to begin again and again, a
novel left off in the middle. Therefore consumption, the ravenous, is at
the heart of _things_ to the extent there is any _meaning_ at all.

out Bob Roberts sometime) and Alec Baldwin up against your blowhards any
day.  Only Charleston, Gibson, and Willis deserve the sobriquet of actor
in your list anyway, and even there its problematic.  Charleston is
certainly somewhat out to pastor, though I recall his performance in
Branagh's Hamlet (aside from Branagh's agile comedy in parts), since he
suddenly made the other actors seem intolerably showy.  Willis has of
course shown he can act off and on, but he seems to want to be a superhero
these days, most egregiously so in that stupid movie about the comet.
Gibson though is the real deal, which you can tell by his megalomaniacal
push to get his version of the Passion done (though I am glad he struck
the most virulent parts of the dialogue).  And yet his Bounty, other than
the scream, is not a patch on Laughton and Gable, and merely adequate in
light of Brando's.  It's interesting that the stars most like character
actors, without the ego (for an actor) and the need to always be the good
guy, are Democrats or on the left.  It says something about how secure
Republican masculinity actually is.

I except you from this, though, Kirby, and consider you functional.  You
probably are a Cancer, though, a sign that needs good advices to keep to
the straight and narrow.  (Cf. Spike)

Thanks, Bruce.  This looks like a good list--just the sort of range of
stuff I was looking for.

Hi all,

in spite of a tri(ai)al of tears and a conundrum worth a penny or twelve we have decided that the magazine, Ambit: Journal of Poetry & Poetics will be back up and running in print format (and on the web soon enough) and will be accepting submissions until the end of the summer, to be fully realised in the fall of this year. I plan on setting up readings in New York City and D.C. Also, Philadelphia sounds like a shot 'cause we have folks like Chris McCreary and C A Conrad in the second issue.

The third issue, while it does not necessarily have a 'thematic' focus, we are interested in the margins between theory and poetry - a language centered poetics that consistently redefines. Please send us work early so we can get a taste of what and who. Think serially, the magazine is finding its niche as a serially motivated text, one that demands that a poem 'evolve' and take up as much or little space as it needs - the mag is beautiful, no clumping or lumping poems together. The dimensions are 8 1/2 height by 7 width. In the past Ambit was a chapbook, but we're planning on perfect-binding the third issue in a larger edition.

While I'm putting this all together, would anyone like to contribute some funds our way? We have an excellent catalogue (that I'll list below) and if folks get magazines I'll throw in some goodies for effect and to show much deserved appreciation. We still have mags for sale, first and second issue (see www.towson.edu/~cacasama/furniture/poae for a peek at what's in the second issue; the first issue, on the other hand, features work from brilliant but unknown poets who have worked with me in New York and here in Baltimore). We also have our very first chap coming out by Donna Kuhn, "Up Bluen", which features exclusive texts, and a screen printing by Sarah Elizabeth Kirby. All HandMade, all full of love, all DIY, independent, and up and coming, whatever you want to call it. Support small presses so we can give back toy you!

Here's the catalogue:

from the 'Serial Pamphleteer Editions'

A :: Donna Kuhn's "Up Bluen" Sampler, 4 pgs. $2

B :: Christophe Casamassima/Sarah Elizabeth Kirby "Writing From Memory", 5 pgs. $2

C :: Christophe Casamassima "Invoice", 4 pgs. $2

D :: Jakub Ekier "All True" translated by Tadeusz Pioro w/ linoleum print by Sarah Elizabeth Kirby,
10 pgs. $4

E :: Niko Vassilakis "The 4th Eleven", 4 pgs. $2

Ambit :: issue one (56 pgs.) $5
Ambit :: issue two point one plus two point two (116 pgs.) $5

Two issues of ambit are $9.

Thanks much, everyone. Expect to see us back on Selby's List with a nice new site and some exciting new texts.

Also, to all the folks who made it to Ithaca for Jane Sprague's Culture Workers conference, thanks for making it a terrific time for me and Sarah, who are basically starting out in the biz. Thanks for the words of support!

Thanks much,

Hi again,

I'm seeking serial works of four pages for the Serial Pamphleteer Editions pamphlet series. We are doing a series of 26 (A-Z, typical, huh?) and we have 5 completed so far. Dimensions are 8 1/2 by 5 or 11 by 4 1/4, you choose

If anyone is interested, please follow up. I'm open to anything.

If anyone needs copies of the pamphlets they're in my last e-mail. very cheap but very pretty.

Thanks again,

Chris

Hi Camille,

KUNM 89.9 in Albuquerque broadcasts & netcasts a show on Sunday from 8:30
to 10:30 called Other Voices, Other Sounds which I think you'd like.
It's hosted by composer Stephen Miller & others (it was once also hosted
by Joan La Barbara), & the show presents the spectrum of experimental
contemporary classic music.  Some nights, it's a knockout.

If you tune into Anal Magic regularly you may know about Charles
Amirkhanian's project at Otherminds: http://www.otherminds.org

As for radio, there's of course Kalvos and Damian's New Music Bazaar:
http://www.kalvos.org/
Personally, I think they talk too much.

Hear and Now on BBC radio 3 can be good (they did a special on Adorno a few
weeks ago, for example).
http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/classical/hearandnow.shtml

My favorite is actually quite simple. Radio@Netscape has an excellent 20th
Century classical station, as well as a Jazz avant-garde channel.
http://radio.netscape.com/radio/radiosell2.html
They real bummer about this is that it's only compatible with Windows. If
you use a Mac, it might work in virtual PC.

Finally, a friend pointed out this great resource for finding out what all
else is out there on web radio: http://www.publicradiofan.com  I've found
some interesting stations in the "eclectic" section.

Further notes on codework:


****************************************


1. "codework"


I think I came up with the name (which surely had been used before) in a
conversation with Ken Wark - we were talking about code - the term at that
point, as far as I remember, was code-poetry - and I borrowed the notion
of 'work' - i.e. labor, production - I think - from Heiner Muller -
running the two words together - as in Hamletmachine - so there was a
political component as well - not wanting the limitation of poetry,
however defined, or poetics for that matter - opening the framework, not
closing it - I'd also felt that code-poetry - however spelled - was too
close to concrete poetry - which didn't interest me at all - at least not
any longer - not even dom sylvester huedard - maybe huedard actually - but
not the usual suspects - anyway - I thought that codepoetry would minimize
the design aspect - emphasize the symbolic or asymbolic or presymbolic -
for that matter the (Kristevan) choratic of language - so the political
and psychoanalytical met on the grounds of mathesis and semiosis - all
this into the naming of the word - pretty commonplace now - at least this
is what was going through my mind at that point - still is - anyway -


2.


Codework impossibility of self-reference and decipherment.


a. "There are seven words in this sentence." Which word is the number?
b. "This is a sentence." But how would one know?
c. "This is written in English." But how would one know?
etc.

- - Self-referentiality possesses a residue; only in mathematics or logic is
it 'pure' - the whole relating to the whole.

The residue is in relation to an attribute. But then

d. "This refers in its entirety to itself." Are we at the juncture of
paradox?
etc.

Using Peirce's distinctions, I'd argue that every painting is first and
foremost ikonic and perceived as such - the paint is never transparent. To
the extent that codework requires interpretation, examination, it is
ikonic as well - one might say that, even in the space of virtuality, it
possesses a materialist foundation. The more 'impenetrable' the greater
the degree of ikonicity, the greater the appearance of _material._ This
appearance is just that, however, appearance, as a change - for example
from monospace to justifiable type - will demonstrate.

One must consider, of course, the semantic residue of the ikonic - and the
interstitial / liminal between the meaning-sememe and the ikonic provides
the _content_ of the work; in fact, the meaning-sememe and ikonic-sememe
are interwoven, inseparable, and contributory, a somewhat similar
situation to the calligraphic.

_Meaning_ itself is both attribute (i.e. 'meaning of _cheval_ in French')
and calligraphic; totality is reserved for the Absolute which is always
problematic ('meaning of Life,' 'meaning of Everything') and ideologically
suspect. To the extent that meaning embraces an Absolute, meaning depends
on decoding (Bible, Koran, Kwak!); here is the locus of political Power in
the Foucauldian sense.

Codework simultaneously embraces and problematizes meaning; one might
argue that codework is _fallen work,_ fallen by the wayside, as well as
the disturbance of the Gnostic Mary Magdalen.

Every more or less traditional text is codework with invisible residue;
every computer harbors the machinic, the ideology of capital in the
construction of its components, the oppression of underdevelopment in its
reliance on cheap labor.

Every text is Derridian/Foucauldian differance; codework is exemplary of
the process of deferral and _rewrite._ Codework, like _wryting,_ is an
embodiment within virtual ontologies; wryting disturbs _towards_ the body,
desire, language - that language of codework, ruptured by codework.

Inner speech as well is self-referential, a decoding of every text spoken
within it, before the reader, or among the readers. And nothing fulfills
_utterly,_ every Absolute itself is codework, a deferral - hence the
psychoanalytical nature of _defuge_ - that decay which comes about through
the overuse of pornography or the attempt to begin again and again, a
novel left off in the middle. Therefore consumption, the ravenous, is at
the heart of _things_ to the extent there is any _meaning_ at all.

That is a great way to put it. That when so-called natural language
is, for example, 'mezangelled,' then "the interiorities of more or
less traditional semantic words" are "broken." The code that breaks
into the words is not necessarily itself broken. (Although let's face
it, if it doesn't get recontextualized pronto, it ain't going to
compile.)

The point is not to valorise or downgrade
(aesthetically/socially/politically) some text because it addresses
or incorporates code, or subgrade it because the constituent code is
broken or operative. Brokenness need not ally with value in any neat
way. [See Sandy Baldwin in the current Cybertext Yearbook]. The
questions are more to do with: what are the properties and methods of
code as such, and how do (and how could) these contribute to language
art making? What are the specificities of code that will allow us to

Because code is often substructure or protocol or generative. As
substructure, it underlies, for example, the very distribution of the
piece. As protocol, it may underlie the very typing or production of the
piece. As generative, it has produced or partially prodced the piece.

Here is the issue; your 'addressing' or 'incorporating' (btw I've read
Baldwin and was just down in Morgantown) implies a separation which for me
- - like the activities in the _chora_ are both problematized and
inseparable.

As far as brokenness is concerned, I am working out of Winograd and Flores
(re: Heidegger) here.

But whose questions, John? These are yours. When you say "more to do with"
- - this is your approach, not mine. When you cay "Class Text" again you're
operating with the notion of "clean code" ("specificities") which may well
not be the case. Look at Kenji's work or nn's writing.

(I want to point out also btw - in relation to the Cybertext book - that
Jim R's work is quite clean, but he's not the only practitioner; I was
doing codework in 71 and later wrote a number of programs in 76-78. Some
of these are now in the internet text. And I was _late_ - Fernbach-
Florsheim was doing things in the 60s with computers/code. Etc. etc.)

Yes I have, but the carriers in this case are structured or dirty
structures - very different. You're coming at this through both literature
and a 'clean' notion of code (see above); I'm not. For example, Perl
poetry is operable, but the residue is pretty much irrelevant - yet as far
as I'm concerned that's a terrific use of code. As is the figlet program.
I don't distinguish - which is why my list in the first place is highly
inclusive, not exclusive.
>

>
Code doesn't necessarily conceal itself. Code doesn't necessarily do
anything you say it does. I wouldn't use the phrase 'language art' myself
- - I think prions are also code, DNA is also code and code is not
necessarily language. I'd have to go back over my Eco for this.

All art is time-based btw. Some of the codework I do takes advantage of
lag (in email or quicktime .mov), and some doesn't and some appears
instantaneous ...

I feel a real difference between us is that I am writing from the position
of dirty code, world-code, which may or may not operate, and that may or
may not be the point. For example one piece I did involved reversing all
the < and > on a specially written webpage. The result is chaotic, dys-
functional in many ways, amazingly functional in others. At West Virginia,
I re-morphed/mapped motion capiture sensors, transforming the body into a
signal or searchlight system (see my heap.mov at http://www.asondheim.org
). And so forth.

It seems to me you're interested primarily in clean and generating
concealed code - I have no problem with that. But I do feel you dismiss
(even the word 'pseudo-code' is dismissive) everything else that's going
on; since you're an editor and critic in the field, it's problematic for
me.

So is Spalding Gray dead ?
Or is he missing?
I've been away in Italy for 6 months - I've only now
heard that he was reported 'missing' in January.

The dark humorist in me - which I assume Spalding Gray might appreciate -
wants to believe that he is at work with the materials for a new piece,
"Swimming in..." (I am too far west to know if he hopped into the Hudson or
the East River).  "Swimming in Cambodia" which I saw him perform in San
Francisco remains my favorite piece, the least narcissistic, the most
worldly and timely in the best sense. Sadly, it now seems, a new piece will
require someone else to write and perform the text. Like many of us in this
odd historical/national moment (Bush turning into the smell of darkened
toast over missing National Guard pay stubs!!!), I suspect Spalding's soul
is treading water before making the next move.

there's quite a lot of voice recognition poetry out there

I've got some at Puppyflowers (4, the sound issue) --

I fed tongue twisters through, and some stuff I actually wrote, some of
that based on some language acquisition exercise books from the 60s that
I bought at a teacher supply house which supplies a lot of vintage
school stuff to set dressers --

I also used the foreign accents -- I had the voice recognition recognize
the computer reader avatars with the different accents, and an
assortment of machine translation into German, French... and kept
looping the material through the readers and voice recognition -- there
are lovely passages from my parrot, who was going a little wild during
the whole experiment, there is a lot of interference from riffling pages
and the voice recognition software translating the sounds of typing in
with the words

all in all, it depends how you've trained your voice recognition
program, and -- of course it was picking up a lot of habits as I was
doing this -- I tried to keep it as dumb / coach it as little as
possible -- what this revealed was just how brand and product conscious
it was coded to be -- kept dropping brand names and (mostly computer)
company names into the text, which, as I mentioned, was originally this
noun-rich sonic environment for little kids

Robert,

Chuck Norris can probably take your whole lot.  Maybe not in terms of acting, but at least
in terms of an alley fight.  I'm not sure he could take them in a debate, either.  Hey,
whose side is Clint Eastwood on?  I really liked Bruce Willis in Sixth Sense.  But then I
liked Alec Baldwin very much in Miami Blues, based on the Willeford novel.  So as usual,
I'm in between right and left, but I don't have cancer insofar as I am aware.  More
importantly, whose side is Chow Yun Fat on?  I really enjoy his movies.  Although he
doesn't have the right to vote for President, I'd still be interested to see if he had an
opinion.  Jackie Chan, too.  There's a funny thing going on in Republican circles btw --
they are mad at Bush for his NEA concessions, for his immigration giveaway, and some other
stuff.  My pastor is starting to consider Bush to be another wacky liberal.

All that aside: Who do you think could write the better poem -- Bush or Kerry?  I do think
the ability to make an emotionally inspiring speech (Lincoln) is linked to an ability to
write poetry.  Even FDR loved poetry.  He knew many of the surrealist Soupault's poems (in
French) and when they met, FDR recited them to him.  This seems to be something that
people don't think is important.  Kerry seems weirdly lifeless in terms of the liveliness
of word choices, and rhetoric.  I don't know what's causing this updraft in his votes
unless it's the height (he's 6'4").  Edwards it seems to me was the one with poetry.  He
liked guns, and could talk about a field in N. Carolina with a bear in it.  That's
something.  Clark was just completely lifeless on the emotional register.  Why are so many
of the bleeding heart liberals so completely lifeless emotionally?  I think the neat thing
in Shakespeare's histories is that the ability to make poetic stump speeches can make or
break a nation.  Henry V could lift his men with a great speech.  Blair can do it in
England.  Bush is dumb, but he has some passion in him, and a little poetry based on his
years of drinking, I think.  I think this is the secret of his success over Gore.  Bush
often reminds me of a watered-down Henry V.  Henry V too had to spend some time in a
tavern before he was worth anything.  The first Kennedy had this quality, and that's why I
think we remember him.  You just forget Presidents who don't have any poetry in em. My
favorite president was Calvin Coolidge.  I loved his lines.  "Business is the business of
America."  When you listen to the Democrats, only Sharpton can turn a phrase, or has any
enjoyment of this ability. Do any of the other Democrats have any poetry in them?  The
female governor of Texas had this, Anne something, and Cuomo showed he had a touch of it.
It's crucial, but is too often neglected.

Kirby, you *have* to be joking about The Smile!!!

Blair is Clinton-lite, feel-my-pain, and his rhetoric is so saccherine it
gives you dental cavities.

His speeches lift the hearts of Blairite Believers here, few else.

And there are fewer and fewer of those as time goes by.

That is a sad one. As a (former) bassist, I used to pay attention to what
Favors did with the Art Ensemble of Chicago. Some components of his style,
particularly his bold tone and tendency to play simply, reminded me of
another Chicago bassist who influenced me, Wilbur Ware.

Where does this leave the AEC now? It would seem that deaths and Jarman's
departure has reduced it to Roscoe Mitchell and Famoudou Don Moye.

Vernon,

Jarman was back when I saw them here in Oakland on Halloween=2E There was =
a
younger guy (Corey Wilkes, I think -- plays in Roscoe Mitchell's nonet as
well) in the trumpet chair=2E As a quartet (Jarman back in the band, but n=
o
trumpet chair) they issued a recording last year called The Meeting, on
Henry Threadgill's Pi label=2E

Oddly, though, I can imagine the group better without Jarman and Bowie tha=
n
without Favors -- so much of what held together the disparate sound-worlds=

of the other musicians, and especially the horns, is down to his presence
on bass=2E Which is not to cast him in the familiar self-abnegating role o=
f
the anchoring "rhythm guy=2E" To my ear, his playing was more often like a=

web than a weight, always teasing out the argument that would run between
the other articulations that were happening on the bandstand=2E His playin=
g
last fall was brilliant, deeply humble in the way that only a fully
confident musical thinker can be=2E

Another great memory is his bass duet with Tatsu Aoki in the San Francisco=

Asian Jazz Festival a few years back, taking a break from some inspired
playing that was both cyclical and non-repetitive (don't know if that make=
s
sense -- it sounded akin to Malian kora playing) to play with some sticks,=

bells, a kazoo, etc=2E There was a sense of a deeply historically-imbedded=

ritual performance going on in that, right alongside the possibility that
here was an aging man tinkering with some small objects simply because it
amused him=2E That ability to locate such an encompassing musical poetics
within something truly quotidian, without having recourse to some cheap
transcendence, holding to the status of his objects as trinkets even as
they became means for exploring a world's worth of musical and cultural
history and possibility -- well, it was like having someone take off the
top of my head and blow fresh air on my brain=2E In the best possible way=2E=


I'll miss him=2E

That's a funny nickname, Robin, for Blair: The Smile.  I hadn't heard it
before.

Blair sounds good to this ear.  He is coherent, and can hold on to an idea
for two minutes at a time. Admittedly, I don't have much exposure to him.
He's certainly sharper than almost anybody in this country since maybe
Senator Paul Simon, but maybe I wouldn't feel that way if I had heard more
from him. Simon could stay on track.  I feel when listening to the Democrats
that they have attention deficit syndrome.  And the Republicans are right
there with them.

How is it that both leading candidates are from this Skull & Bones club at
Yale?

The whole event of politics in this country seems more and more suspicious to
me.  I don't trust anything that anybody's saying at any level on either
"side."  I'm not even sure there are sides. It's more like good cop/ bad cop.

Inside of this, I can't even believe what is going on in the universities.  I
keep thinking of the Dylan song -- something's going on and you don't know
what it is, do you, Mr. Jones.  Substitute me for Jones.  Something is going
on.  Suddenly the top universities start to pretend to care about race,
gender and class.  This can't really be possible.  I suspect it's a
diversion, or it's some kind of psychological warfare to divide the middle
and lower classes while the upper class (I am very suspicious of Unitarians
just now and suspect they are behind a lot of things, with the Episcopalians
and Methodists right behind them -- upper-upper class WASP churches playing
havoc in terms of creating diversions -- playing middle class and lower class
groups against one another in a kind of psychological war).  There is
something very suspicious to me about how race, gender, and class via Marx of
all people has become such a rallying cry especially at colleges at all the
major state colleges.  Something's moving into place, and I would like to buy
time to figure out what it is.  Foucault and Derrida and even Edward Said are
from extremely upper class families.  I can't believe what they are saying.
Call it ad hominem!  Simone de Beauvoir never had to work and went to the
very best institutions. The most suspicious thing to me is the low quality of
the writing of these theorists.  Edward Said or Simone de B.  They can't
write poetry.  Derrida can't, either.  Breton and many members of his group
could write poetry, and they have been wiped out.   One cannot cite them.
They have lost standing.

I had the same feeling about the hippy movement.  That it was some kind of
attempt to destroy the middle and lower class through a sort of diversion.
Most of the top hippies went to Columbia and places like that.  There was an
attempt to divide families and make kids distrust their parents.  And also
abandon their religion.  And despise their heritage and their ancestors.
These were sources of strength to a lot of people and now that source of
strength has been obliterated for most.  I even feel that way about feminism
-- that it's a wedge method of disrupting middle and lower class families to
prevent their political power from consolidating.

The only thing I still trust is poetry -- and I don't hear much of this
coming from anywhere.  Something's wrong.  But I don't know what it is.

Actually I think it was "Swimming *to* Cambodia," which is
even more darkly humorous.

No, I'm saying not because it's there (it's always there) but that it's
presence in one form or another in the work problematizes language,
structure, and body; it also questions production itself (producing or
programming code). It's a writing which in part litearlly in-forms itself;
as such it also problematizes translation since to some extent it
translates only into itself.

I don't think so at all, although on the surface of course. It's clean on
the surface because all ascii is clean, well-defined, as is the digital
domain, with its reliance on potential wells of code/noise itself. But in
terms of interpretation, the discomfiture and abjection can be strong. I'm
thinking for example of the pieces Kim McGlynn and I did using ytalk
(Perth to NY) a few years ago.

The digital always possesses this 'turn' of cleanliness - to the extent
that 0/1 permits no undesired noise and is infinitely reproducible - and
filth - to the extent that the media literally become dirty, outmoded,
useless, and no longer run. So there's eternity on one hand and tremendous
fragility on the other.

Of course I have no disagreement with you here.

I think the world is dirty, people are dirty, in the sense of Mary Douglas
or Kristeva (Powers of Horror); code in a formal sense is a defense
against that. So I'm interested in the interplay of world and code, which
is to say in that liminal area between consciousness and formal systems -
which takes into account desire, sexuality, stumbling about, etc. And I'm
fascinated by plasma, which at least on a theoretical level, can efface
all codes, not even leaving debris behind.

Perl poetry is definitely clean and restrained - my point is that the
poetic content is secondary to its running. It's by necessity a tour de
force.

I've never been sure why Joyce comes up in these discussions; it's hardly
code or hyper etc. etc. Surely there are other examples? There's always
the pseudo-14th-century writing of Chatterton, for example, which did have
roots in dictionaries, translations. And for strict coding, there's early
television (late 19th-century) with its scanning and spark-gap images...

I'll go to the URL... The running is always clean, even if there's a core
dump. One might say it runs as it runs. But not all codework has code in
it or is running; I wanted to make that point in the typology. The work
presented may well be the residue of running code, or as in Mez, something
else entirely, a diacritical structure imposed on 'english.'

I wouldn't say unconscious here, at least not necessarily, since the
unconscious is also the site of the repressed, i.e. the 'dirty,' and the
code runs clean and linear (more or less). (In that sense every program,
like every dream, is successful, no matter what; it does what it does.)

Here I agree with you; one thing about institutions, however - I think
codework (and the name tends towards inclusivity as I said somewhere) at
least so far has avoided such; if anything, for example on Poetics, it's
somewhat of a gadfly or irritant - it refuses to go away, refuses to
acknowledge that it's _not_ poetry or for that matter that it _is_ poetry
- in a sense it's got the same sort of empathetic relation to language one
might find in the Upanishads...

A sample of morse code doesn't operate either. It's readable, and the
code-forms, for example, Mez' are readable as well.

Pseudo implies a relationship to truth - i.e. a 'pseudo-intellectual' as
opposed to a 'real intellectual.' It's a questionable term, I think,
although I'm not sure what else might be used - something like quasi-code,
or vary-code.

Well here's the heart of the matter. I don't think the people I respect
(this is a strange term here) do such kludging - that's what I was
reacting against. I don't think I do, or Mez, or solipsis, or noemata, or
nn, or jodi, or yourself for that matter. And much of this work isn't text
based at all - Kenji and nn and myself have all done cdroms related to our
other work, I've done video, some people have used flash. I think of
codework as multimedia. But kludging would be, at least to me, fairly
boring (although kludging within the same world is interesting).

Robin,

I know Kirby is overrating the Prime Minister, but here in America we are
desperate for an adult in the White House, that is somebody who seems to
seek adequate response, rather than gets defensive if you say that maybe
something somewhere is going wrong.  To our ears, Blair is this sort of
person.  I guess you should be glad you are in England.

Deadline for proposals: 1 March 2004

Brunel Centre for Contemporary Writing is hosting an international
conference on contemporary writing and invites submissions for papers under
the heading: Contemporary Writing Environments. The conference is the first
of what will be a biennial event and will take place over three days from
Thursday July 8th-Saturday to July 10th 2004 on Brunel Campus, West London.

The confirmed Keynote Speaker is Charles Bernstein, internationally
renowned poet and theorist. Confirmed plenary speakers are: Julian
Wolfreys, Thomas Docherty, Peter Nicholls, Andrew Gibson, Nicholas Royle
and Dennis Walder. The conference will also host a number of readings by
poets and novelists, concluding with Sarah Waters, author of Tipping the
Velvet.

We are interpreting the title Contemporary Writing Environments very widely
and hope that the conference will be a broad church not only in terms of
types of contemporary writing considered, but also in terms of approaches
to this writing. Possible themes for panels might include the following:
- Writing and the environment
- Virtual Environments
- Contemporary writing locations
- Material Environments
- The cultural space of contemporary writing
- Contemporary writing and theory
- Cognitive environments
- The ethical environment
- Disciplinarity as environment

Abstracts of no more than 200 words should be submitted to both Dr Stephen
Benson AND Dr William Watkin:
stephen.benson@brunel.ac.uk
william.watkin@brunel.ac.uk

A number of panels have already been proposed and we welcome further
suggestions. Each panel will consist of three papers.

Closing date for submission of abstracts: 1 March 2004

{i had sent this to alison the other day - having exceeded my daily =
quota -
and hence i quote here again - forwarded onto the forum}

Alison,

actually, i think we essentially agree -- perhaps it's just a question =
of
precision on my part which i am afraid i will still remain far from
offering...

what i mean when i speak of depression as a form of knowledge relates
precisely to the "dark cloud of unknowing" as you nicely put it. in a =
large
sense, depression is a way in which the subject comes to terms with the
meaning of the possibility of his own death. it is in that sense that
depression is both a form of being & of knowledge. & we know that
phenomenological psychiatry focuses on that separation of that which is
internally feared (essentially, death) & of the exteriority where those
fears become expressed (and, perhaps, somehow healed). here, again, i =
could
give the example of de chirico, whose paintings clearly respond to his
anguish: the empty squares with overshadowing statues, squares where =
"it"
can happen or has already happened, the anguish of not knowing, the
collapsing of quotidian siesta-time street-desertion & of fatal =
abandonment.
hence, anguish can be seen as creative, i think, in so far as one must =
give
it an external form in order to, if not overcome it, but to survive it =
(?)
derrida speaks in those terms in "voix & le ph=E9nom=E8ne" where he =
states that
the interior monologue is already subject to exteriority & that that =
voice
is always intertwined with fiction, & further, that death is always
inscribed into the possibility of some signifying system. the withheld
knowledge is the impossible, unattainable knowledge, then. & the anguish
present in depression (even if oftentimes we might experience this in a =
more
superficial guise & not actually think of death & our thoughts may =
revolve
around something quite banal) is fundamentally related to the thought of
death (and here, cioran once more, for whom the thought of death is =
almost
the single thing worth thinking about & the very thought that keeps him =
from
dying, i.e. from taking his own life -- & here, although i could never
confirm this in any scientific way, i speculate as to immediate reasons =
of
suicides committed in a depressive state -- if one would get trapped in =
this
position between the impossibility of knowing & the only possibility of
knowing :: _sort of_ like in the"idiot" where dostoevsky speaks of the
peaking tension of a person facing about to be executed, occupying the =
last
five minutes of his life with bidding farewell to the world, and then =
left,
within that last minute with such anxiety that he almost wishes the =
soldiers
would fire sooner -- well, i digress, into a different territory, but in
some way, the anguish of something bound to happen & not happening is
there).

elliptically, i'm afraid...

With all the ups and downs following the destruction of the Furniture Crew last summer, we're proud to announce that we're back on out feet and in the midst of a huge production and reinstallation of our catalogue. The website will be up and running in a short time, no idea when, but will be a beautiful remnant of last year's fiasco.

What I do need to do now is to mention a Chapbook Contest that will dedicate all its funds and energy into the production of the winning project. The specs are as follows below.

Any questions let me know.

To everyone: thanks for the support in the past, and thanks for the support in the future.

Christophe Casamassima



chapbook contest

Furniture Press announces it’s first annual chapbook competition, although sadly competition is such a cruel word these days (well, why not use convolution? it sounds like competition?) Right, our first annual chapbook CONVOLUTION, which consists of the following guidelines & deadlines.

2004 Prize

An edition of two hundred [200] copies of the chapbook will be pressed & twenty-five [25] copies will be given to the winner [extra copies can be purchased at a handsome discount]. A broadside will also be pressed of a [poem/text/text-event] of the winner’s choosing along with a linoleum print of the cover art.

Miscellany

20-40 pages. No pure ‘genre’ confinement necessary here. You send us your best work, whether it be textual, image-based, text-image hybrids, text art [you get the picture]. Please send one [poem/image/text-event] per page, unless form dictates alternatives, which we encourage.

Include a cover sheet with name, address, telephone, e-mail. Do not put your name on individual sheets [we like a bias free reading, viewing].

If you have published individual works elsewhere it is not an issue, although the full manuscript must not have been published previously as a group. Submit a full list of acknowledgements of previously published work.

You may send multiple submissions, but please mail them separately & with the appropriate cover sheet & SASE’s.

A $10 [U.S.] reading fee can be submitted by cash, check or money order, payable to Furniture Press. All fees [every penny, mind you] is used to press & promote the chapbooks.

Include an SASE if you wish to be notified by mail that we have received your manuscript.

All applicants receive a free copy of the winning chapbook and discounted prices on multiple copies.

Deadline

Postmark all entries between April Fool’s Day 2004 & Halloween 2004. Sooner or later is better than never.




Mail to:

Furniture Press Chapbooks
c/o Christophe Casamassima
8418 Greenway Road Apt. D
Baltimore, MD 21234

Although the work you submit may fail to be lauded as ‘over & above’ we never hesitate to consider it for future publication, in whole or in part. Our resources may be limited but we have a secret recipe.

Torments likely too much for Spalding Gray
LYNNE DUKE; The Washington Post

NEW YORK - His scent still lingers on the bed sheets in their SoHo loft.
Kathie Russo hasn't changed them. She wants to remember the last time
her husband, Spalding Gray, slept there.

His skis still stand in a corner of the living room. He was supposed to
fly to Aspen on Jan. 10, but his flight was canceled. So he saw a movie,
"Big Fish," with two of their kids, Theo and Marissa, and walked the
dog.


That evening, with Russo at a conference, Gray went back out. He boarded
the Staten Island Ferry. For years, the acclaimed 62-year-old
monologuist and actor had been tormented and suicidal. And that evening,
he vanished. He could be alive, out there somewhere. But those closest
to him, who know his obsession with death, fear he jumped into New York
Harbor.


Since then Russo has waited, worried, suspected the worst and waited
some more. Family and friends have poured out support. ("Mom, why are
all these people bringing food?" 7-year-old Theo innocently asked.)


Looking for clues or a note, police have searched the couple's three
residences and found nothing helpful, Russo says.


What happened to Spalding Gray? No one can say for sure.


Russo, 43, Gray's wife of seven years and partner for 14, has had to
make life go on, for the three children. She would like to think she has
shielded Theo and Forrest, 11. (Marissa, 17, knows, or at least
suspects.)


On his birthday four days after his father's disappearance, when helium
balloons filled the house, Theo told Russo, "Mom, tomorrow I'm gonna let
the balloons go with a note, 'Please help me find my daddy.'"


Obsessed with death


He expressed such profound love for his children. He called Theo "my
outdoor bliss kid" and Forrest "child light of my life." Marissa, he
wrote, was a "drama queen" - as much, perhaps, as he was a drama king.
He had not expected children; had not wanted them. But they transformed
him and brought him fullness.


Yet even as he wrote of the preciousness of fatherhood in his 1999 book
"Morning, Noon and Night," the specter of death lurked over him. "The
disembodied voice of death still visits me every day to remind me that I
will die, and the idea of that, of not being here forever, just wipes me
out," he wrote.


Death has been Gray's obsession. It petrified him, yet he grew
accustomed early on - from his own mother's suicidal threats - to
death's constant presence.


He is known as a man of some angst, of edge, maybe a little bit crazy in
that colloquial show biz kind of way. His award-winning stage
monologues, including "Swimming to Cambodia" and "Gray's Anatomy," both
of which became movies, are filled with anxiety. He has told stories
straight from the strangeness of his life, from his own marital
infidelity to a near-death experience in Ireland. His gift as an artist
has been the ability to tell stories that seemed literary even as they
were extemporaneous, free-associated.


"Most of us didn't recognize it as mental illness at all, because he was
incredibly gifted about bringing back those experiences" in his
monologues, says Mark Russell, executive director of Performance Space
122, an experimental theater and cultural center in the East Village
where Gray developed work. "And we're all a little bit crazy. In my
business it's a necessity."


But over the years, Gray had been diagnosed as depressed or bipolar or
obsessive-compulsive, depending on the doctor, Russo says. He has taken
enough medication to make his body a pharmaceutical cocktail.


Accident in Ireland


In June 2001, during a trip to Ireland that was a 60th-birthday present
from Russo, Gray's life fractured.


Russo drove that night. Friends filled the rental car. Gray sat in the
back, behind his wife. A small truck smashed into them head-on, shoving
the car's engine into the front seat.


Russo was treated for burns, severe bruising and a head injury requiring
a dozen stitches.


Gray's forehead crashed into the back of Russo's head. His eyeglasses
were embedded into his sinuses. His skull was cracked, the frontal lobe
of his brain was damaged. His hip was broken, his sciatic nerve severed.
He was left with metal plates in his skull and hip, had extensive
surgery four times and needed rehabilitation to learn to walk again.


The suicide attempts began, which led to two stays in psychiatric
hospitals. He saw a shrink as often as twice a week.


The man he once was, he was no more. Russo recalls how he spoke of
feeling tired and old.


"He was feeling so reduced from the effects of the accident," says
Rockwell Gray, Spalding's older brother, a lecturer in English at
Washington University in St. Louis. "Physical impairment weighed on him
heavily."


In 2002, Spalding left a note on the kitchen table and jumped from a Sag
Harbor bridge, a fall of 25 feet. A passer-by rescued him. She asked him
later, "'How do you feel?' And he said, 'Well, I got that out of my
system.'"


Two more suicidal episodes followed. At that same bridge, a stranger
talked Gray down from the railing. Last fall, he left a telephone
message saying he would jump from the Staten Island Ferry. Russo called
police, who found Gray roaming Staten Island.


In September, he had the most recent of his surgeries. In October, he
started two months of workshop performances at PS 122 of a monologue
about the accident, "Life Interrupted."


Though patrons understood the monologue still was in development, Gray's
reputation was such that some expected far more than he at first could
deliver, says Russell. There were a few irate phone calls about the
quality of the performances. But Russell saw Gray blossoming anew.


"He was a man dealing with physical disabilities and obviously
depression," Russell says, "and he would be sometimes more present and
animated. ... Actually the piece was hilarious, no matter how terrifying
the situation was. That's why this was such a shock to many of us,
because I just thought we had gotten him back."


Haunted by mother's suicide


Gray felt he would kill himself at 52 - his mother's age when she took
her life. He felt, say Russo and Rockwell Gray, somehow destined to meet
the same end.


He had been close to his mother, in terms of her "wild energy" and how
it "corresponded to something in him," his brother says. Spalding spent
time with her while she "was having periodic troubles, like a
breakdown."


"From the age of 12, she would ask him how she should kill herself,"
says Russo. Gray chronicled some of this period in "Swimming to
Cambodia."


In '67, when Gray was 26, his mother died from inhaling exhaust fumes in
her garage. On his 52nd birthday, Gray went into depression and had
suicide fantasies.


His sense of doom deepened when he and his family moved into a new Long
Island home in North Haven, near Sag Harbor - on Sept. 11, 2001. The
movers arrived as the couple saw the news of the terror attacks. Gray
never felt comfortable in the new house.


He talked to Russo and his brother of the fact that his mother moved
unhappily into a new home shortly before her death. His moods swung
wildly. He receded into silence for days at a time. Psychologist Robby
Stein, a close friend of 17 years and Theo's godfather, says Gray
frequently told him about his fears.


"He felt he was being attacked by witches, that there was a cosmic and
universal plot against him, that he was too weak to resist it, that he
had what his mother had, that he was detrimental to his family," Stein
says. "He could not get it out of his mind, that he was being taken over

I saw Spalding Gray perform "Swimming to Cambodia" in
Sydney years ago.
I was writing for theatre back then & my collaborator,
Jan McKemmish, had described a Wooster Group
performance she'd seen in NYC.
We based a couple of our performance texts on their
presentations using microphones.
Spalding Gray, as an influence, hovered in the
background of some of our texts..

no such problem being a writer sponsored by Johnny Walker (like Tom
Beller of Open City was) -- they give you a free case & you have to
appear in bars -- seems ripe for a class action suit to me, twelve
stepping writers against Johnny Walker or some such

seems to be a very clear use of appropriation of a branded commodity for
an artistic use, except that the title of the book is an obvious
(illegal) drug reference (alcohol companies tend to be very sensitive
about being associated with drugs that aren't as legal as theirs), and
the cover of a  book is a marketing tool as well as a sort of art and
craft

the publisher is a shock publisher

ANNOUNING!
(Please help to spread the word!)

atticus/finch is pleased to announce the release of its inaugural
chapbook, Cynthia Sailers¡¦ "Rose Lungs."

Rose Lungs is printed in an edition of 100 copies with beautifully
letterpressed covers (with the help of Kyle Schlesinger of Cuneiform
Press), and here¡¦s the best part: they¡¦re actually affordable! That¡¦s right
folks, each is only FIVE DOLLARS!!

This is Sailers¡¦ first collection, and bound to be a MAJOR contribution to
a new generation of American Letters, so purchase now to avoid crying
much later over a fittingly stale beer, or even sadder, in a rare books
room somewhere in the Midwest, alone, wearing a pair of over-sanitized
gloves, wishing you could take the thing home to put on your barren
bookshelf! Sailers is the current curator of "The New Brutalism" reading
series in Oakland, and her first full-length collection, "Lake Systems" (of
which "Rose Lungs" is independent) will be printed later in the year by
Tougher Disguises.

If you aren¡¦t familiar with Sailers' elegant lines, take a look below:

Constant Urbania
O rose lungs¡XDominique Fourcade

Regarding tenderness I wasn¡¦t prepared.  She says this politely.  She
rose and was about to leave,  you were not tending to¡X.  I love her
austere courtesy as well. By being third in line to see how her glasses
broke and China dishes.  She considers this.  She considers the inane
source of going. Uncertain of taking off her gloves she asks me to spit on
the roses.   For winter, spring, and summer.  A borrowed coat and genius
and terraces and husbandry and waterfowl and mongrels and
watchfulness.  Pleasure speaks: what can I do but say therefore.  I
walked the aisles a maiden form¡Xthis is my stay¡Xthe erotic in that I am
chasing the winter down for free and claim the acreage soft.  Constant
Urbania sends this to me, desolate ladies now all alone.  Yet for a more
wondrous I, come close¡Xwasted in desire my eyes prevail and reappear
half empty for it.

Study From Life, 1889

How little I know of real pain.  & yet inflicting the same on her as on
objects themselves.  I was longing to be tied up for civilization's sake.
But there I was in the face of John Singer Sargent's girl with buttocks
exposed.  She is not to be mocked.  Then she says, you bore me.  You
and pornography.  Misanthrope, your only self-defense is in the
crawlspace.  (Faraway) in sea fog I thought better than to procure an
inveterate narcissism.  Barthes says, in Japan everything changes.
Puzzling, I was an accident  under blue sky yonder.  " A supplement to
palpable boredom."  Unless it is reached through another field of bliss.
The waters are murky, and when the wreck starts, each piece is a
beautiful lie.

Rodney Koeneke sez:

'What we quixotics want are the facts,' and in Rose Lungs Cynthia Sailers
gives us some seriously beautiful information. Her poems fuse lyric
enchantment with an austere courtesy,' written as if in the voice of the
astral double in a Victorian photograph. Sailers puts the desiring self
through a lush stutter of pronouns that blurs the rip between they and it
and her and I and you; her 'fidelity to reside in between' takes us to a
place where philosophy's at home to the erotic and perception 'is reached
through another field of bliss.' This is writing that makes the fin de siecle
feel like a new beginning--'Pleasure speaks: what can I do but say
therefore.'

POV: a message from leonard peltier
==============================

Below is LEONARD PELTIER9S annual message delivered in conjunction with
the
anniversary of his incarceration on February 6th. Please broadcast as
widely
as possible to as many groups as possible. This is a message to all
people
regardless of color:

LEONARD PELTIER
PO Box 583
Lawrence, KS 66044
http://www.leonardpeltier.org
Leonard Peltier Defense Committee

January 23, 2004

HAU KOLA, Hello my friends, my relatives:

You can never imagine the heartfelt comfort it brings to know you're not

forgotten in prison. This is my 28th year, and I've seen others come and
go
and return again. I can't help but feel a great sorrow for many of these

young men who keep coming back for one reason or another; most of  which
are
alcohol related offenses. So much has changed since I came here and yet,
in
many ways, it's still the same.

The government, under the pretext of security and progress, liberated us

from our land, resources, culture, dignity and future. They violated
every
treaty they ever made with us. I use the word "liberated" loosely and
sarcastically, in the same vein that I view their use of the words
"collateral damage" when they kill innocent men, women, and children.

They describe people defending their homeland as terrorists, savages and

hostiles, and accuse us of being aggressors. We have never fought a
battle
or war that was not on our own land; we never fired the first shot ...
ever.
My words reach out to the non-Indian: Look now before it's far too late
see
what is being done to others in your name and see what destruction you
sanction when you say nothing. Your own treaty, the one between
yourselves
and the government, is being violated daily; this treaty is commonly
known
as the Constitution.

With us, they started a little at a time, encroaching on our rights
until we
had none at all. It will be the same for the Constitution; this is not
conjecture, but fact. We are not embattled with the color of man, but
with
the weakness of man, a mindset that lusts for power and wealth at the
expense of life.

Men of all colors, cultures and religions must stand together to oppose
the
genocidal policies that face us all as the corporate world seeks to
enslave
all, and pit one nation against another.

If you avoid breaking laws and do what you're told and ignore the poor,
the
oppressed and the downtrodden - you probably won't be bothered. If you
try
to right what is wrong, however, you will surely meet great opposition
and
run the risk of imprisonment or death.

I am a Sun Dancer. I took a vow for my people. I chose to seek the
Creator's
will and to follow it to the best of my ability. I WILL NOT STAND DOWN
FROM
THAT VOW. I will continue to speak, write and organize until Grandfather

himself quiets my life. If I can do this in prison, I have no doubt you
can
do much better from where you stand.

I encourage you to do your best, be kind to one another, seek harmony
and
balance with all natural life, enjoy what freedom you have left, and
most of
all, never, never give up.

In the Spirit of Crazy Horse,
Leonard Peltier

Subject:      Return of the Booty-Kit Pirate
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Return of the Booty-Kit Pirate



In leatherette, he cases the formulas
for each of our newly designated pirate bands.
One watt usually covers a few miles
overboard and escapes with no visible gold
near the surface. The coppers waltz on a permanent tea break.

There’s a free brochure with a panorama of the gaming vessel,
a few miles from where the privileged kids live.

An information pirate, he develops around the water.
Squarely built, eagle-faced,
he’s bold to engage a menacing junker,
but even pirates make mistakes and click for info
on Pirate Island employment
in advance of the planned treasure hunt.

“You too can be a cunning smuggler,”
the Booty-Kit Pirate smiles in the hot shop for hot electronics,
hot DVD’s and hot music. “The whole pirate squad
must be mounted on jetbikes
with a new gadget to halt un-piratelike behaviour
if a pirate sabotages your ship. But remember,
the Pirate 3000 is NOT for offroading.” He twirls his velveteen eyepatch,
“The pirate life is no sanctuary for danger.
Hidden forces are out to meddle in little girls’ heads
who read infringed biographies of famous pirates
and dream of working at elite publishing firms.”

At Pirate’s Cove, enjoy adventure golf amongst
lavish landscaping and delightful pirate themes
working in tandem with 36” side doors, double swing out rear doors,
double jack stands, electric brakes, a one-piece
roof and an inside light. “See? I ain’t touchin the brake,”
he shows the kids during a jaunt in Aruba wielding a
nasty, serrate scimitar so the kids can see a heist in action.
When it’s mentioned that equipment for producing CD’s
was seized by humanoid robots, a rope ladder descends
from the Booty-Kit’s dry leafy innards,
where anything goes if it’s pirate related.

The plane, a twin-engine turboprop King Air,
rattles off the names of the Raytheon-built missles
in its booty. “Defense contractor plans to
shake it like a Polaroid picture,” says CNN headline.
Gaps in air security; bomb blast at Yale
along with five other activists were responsible
for building the Patriot system flies a “skull
and cross bone” flag in memory of defense contractors.
Wolf Blitzer calls it another lame excuse
to justify breaking the law to provide transients a fine
calf-leather slip-on shoe. Photocopy the whole book.

But once upon a time, there was a pirate who loved booty.
Thoia thoing, he developed a system to gain booty.
A giant inflatable pirate slip n’ slide.
The “Pirate Boy” is a child-size costume made up of a
giant tanker truck gushing cold water for overheated fans.

“Get ready for a slip, weaklings! Ha! Think your minefields can bother
pirates?!”
“So now we need to slip out of this noose you’ve slipped over us.”

Avast matey’s, Nancy Drew’s The Mystery of Pirate’s Cove
answers questions you always wanted to ask like:
“Did you find anything good at the book sale?
They had a TON of good stuff this year!” For instance:
6 gold doubloons, 6 pieces of eight,
1 brass wagering top, 1 handbook of pirate lore and the rules of the game.
Is there a ghost loose in the booty?

One of the kids calls himself Davy Crockett. “What’s my Pirate Name?”
mocks the Booty-Kit Pirate, “Call me Mom. Legend of the Isles!
Iron this Jolly Roger patch on your fave pair of pants.” So cool
for vessel attacks! PIRATE FETISH MACHINE #5 dedicates a video
to a pirate doorstop: cast iron, orig. paint, pirate sitting on top
of treasure chest. Slim chance to give you a gem.

Many soundtracks are just masturbatory flings relying
solely on gimmicky 3-D to carry the whole movie.
On his shoulder perches a parrot, but this one is mechanical
(enthusiasts hate gimmicks!). Also, there are ocean storms
and real whales (not space whales). The high point is a mock wedding
where the newly-hitched Mr. and Mrs. Pirate
get eye patches. The book is also good. It has a funny copyright page
and tricks with typefaces.

Now the Booty-Kit Pirate is the sole face of Pirate MTV
along with his jolly pirate band with jolly pirate nicknames.
The Booty-Kit full of hot tracks – some Ludacris or Clipse –
full of classic hip-hop sounding Playmobil Pirate Starter Sets
for rockstar baby jogging strollers with homeboy shuffles
learned from Snoop Doggy. Though these kids may threaten their karaoke host
if they can’t cut steamy scenes from the new video,
“A Party Bucket of Modelling Dough.” Vandross; pants off.

A how-to booty. The Booty-Kit Pirate’s battles heat up!
“For the mysterious pieces to a mysterious treasure map,
I wear me silver-buckle slippers and me
tight, shiny saucepan over low heat. As ingredients begin to brown
add Pirate’s Gold (considered good money in the 1700’s)”
Meaning begins to slip.

Deaths from scurvy enable large lasers from
a Shakespearean volume that demands reparation!
“Shakespeare was a no-talent,” the pirate rambles,
“Avast! I’ve seen liberals tie Shakespeare’s narrative
together with pleather. Fuck with a pirate and London
Publishers will accuse you of appropriation.”

At Pirate’s Cove, students can learn
about the only known pirate shipwreck in a haunted house.
Kids can find evidence that the ancient story of
Alexander the Great is morally serviceable, where the pirate
helps pirate decor which includes a 39” Jointed Pirate
and themed birthday parties. The Booty-Kit Pirate’s skull
is glow-in-the-dark resin. His treasure foil balloon
comes flat-packed and true; “At Pirate’s Cove,
live by your own set of rules!”

Waves build whimsical sandcastles: 205 properties
presented in alphabetical order. He tells the kids that
the principle of love doesn’t apply outside of the cocoon.
“While in my candy cocoon, I need cigarettes and ventilation.”

Police build bonfires to burn protesters’ possessions
away from “pirate natural gas hookups” the state insists exists.
The roof, the roof is on fire. “Who authorized sewer lines?”
On his pirate clipboard, an audit of 18,000 homes
where yachts feature full hookups, including cable TV.
In his hip pouch, clasped with a silver wren charm,
a pearl falls out so he must be an oyster.

A Pirate Cruise is a state of mind: a cocoon stitched in wiry silk.
Grease bands round your legs. Parasites like
velvet ants, cuckoo wasps. No prey, no pay.

A hit is a kill; all dead pirates rejoin the sea. The phases of the moon
deliver a vicious pistol whipping. Pirate-radio wannabes
target the virtual parrot machine, wear enough mascara
to play a racoon. Play dress-up: crushable foam pirate hat
with a classic bandanna silk-screened with a winking Jolly Roger
(so post-ironic). A redefinition of “pirate” to graduating
from high school a mild cocaine addiction.

We're extremely honored to present Lyn Hejinian, reading from her newest
work, The Fatalist.  Composed from a year's worth of edited
correpondence, the Fatalist has a charming tone which posits the reader
as an intimate addressee: "Letters are *small* literary facts.  They
aren't canonical.  We get lots of them.  There's one just 10 inches from
my pen and 13 inches from a plastic replica of an ivory figure of a
grinning man."  Lyn Hejinian is a poet, essayist and translator.  She
was born in the San Francisco Bay Area and currently lives in Berkeley.
The most recently published volumes of her poetry are A Border Comedy,
Slowly, and My Life in the Nineties.  The University of California Press
published a collection of her essays entitled The Language of Inquiry in
2000.  Since 1976 Hejinian has been the editor of Tuumba Press and she
is also the co-director (with Travis Ortiz) of Atelos, a literary
project
commissioning and publishing cross-genre work by poets.  Other
collaborative projects include a composition entitled Que Tran with
music by John Zorn and text by Hejinian, a mixed media book entitled The

Transcontinental Poetry Award from Pavement Saw Press, and Empires of
the Mind: I.A. Richards and Basic English in China (Stanford UP, 2003).

Hi Ela - there is no doubt in my mind that anguish (a word I like because i=
t
is freer of pathology) _can_ be creative, and I think for the reasons you
say.  This whole point so easily gets drawn into the gravity of the romanti=
c
clich=E9 of the suffering artist that it feels a little perilous to talk abou=
t
it! - there's that common logical fallacy that because some artists are
depressed, being depressed means that one is an artist.  (And here I feel
compelled to say that there are quite a few happy artists too.  Matisse, a
painter I like very much, couldn't paint suffering to save his life.)   Wha=
t
matters is I guess a sense of aesthetic - by which I mean a consciousness o=
f
formalities and most certainly not formalism as it seems to be generally
understood - in any work, which seems to have to be more conscious the
stronger the emotional impulse that underlies it.

There is also the point that creating can be anguishing... :) again I am
waving away the "suffering artist" clich=E9, but the fact is that imagining
anguish, if it is to be done at all honestly, means that in some way one ha=
s
to experience it, or draw on the experiences of anguish one has felt and
imaginatively extend them.  This is where I've found that reading about
performance, say Grotowski's idea of the holy actor, can be very
stimulating.

Best

I wonder if I can get a link for "Iraq Reward Program" at Big Bridge so that
if anyone clicks through to Big Bridge to the CIA with information about WMD
then Big Bridge will get a percentage of the award. Sort of like Amazon
Books. A great way to underwrite the Phil Ochs Tribute!

hi all: the below documents the appearance in our U newspaper of an
ad that encourages students to report professors' mentions of current
political events in the classroom.  has anyone seen anything like
this elsewhere, at your institutions?  we are wondering if it'd make
sense to stage some kind of organized action whereby we tell our
students to report us.

I like the use of 'anguish' for the romantic view of depression and suicidal
artists that seems so easy and common these days.  I like anguish because
clearly creativity and joy can spring from anguish.  Clinically it is also
helpful to think in those terms as the easy coupling of depression and
suicide doesn't work - the truly DEPRESSED don't have the energy or
inclination to act.  "Agitated depression" is a clinical concept that might
equate to anguish except that 'agitated' connotes fear and trembling without
anticipation.

angst is good too, as it is heideggerian, but also because it is related
to anxiety.  some depressions are the brain's way of dealing with an
overstimulated mind.  very confusing because the chatter is what seems to
be the very you of you, but other subterranean processes can't deal. rmc

The Square Root of Two to 1 Million Digits
What follows are the first 1 million digits of the square root of 2. Actually there are slightly more than 1M digits here. These digits were computed by Robert Nemiroff (George Mason University and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center) and checked by Jerry Bonnell (University Space Research Association and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center). There were computed during spare time on a VAX alpha class machine over the course of a weekend. Although these digits have been checked once we encourage others to check them as well.

irony and syncopation. The body is converted into narrative where
syntactical play rules--this is reminiscent of Gertrude Stein's

speaker called New Traditions in East Asian Bar Bands. There's a
recording on Zorn's label Tzadik <http://www.tzadik.com/>. The
catalog number for the CD is TZ 7311.

Que Tran is for two keyboards (the recording is by Wayne Horvitz and

PLEASE COME!


Brenda Iijima, Prageeta Sharma & Dale Sherrard

Sunday, February 15th
at the Zinc Bar
90 West Houston Street
New York, NY

7 pm

Brenda Iijima's book AROUND SEA just came out from O BOOKS. For this event
she'll give a talk centered on the subject: COLOR, stemming from her essay,
COLOR AND ITS ANTECEDENTS published as a chapbook by Yen Agat Books of
Bangkok (manifested in time for this reading!).

Prageeta, I am told, will perform with Dale a multimedia piece--of this I
don't know more....

Dale Sherrard is visual artist, performer, and is currently working
primarily in experimental video composition. He has exhibited and performed
in New York and Europe for over 20 years, recently focused on a series of
sound and video installations, and he once shot a man in Phoenix just to
watch him die. His first CD entitled HOMELITE GRAVELY: SORRY ABOUT THE RAGE
is slated for release in spring 2004.

I second that request, David! Bravo...no, I don't think the "heat" is
elsewhere these days, though perhaps some people are trying to convince you
that's the case.

Well, I have something to talk about. I went to a wonderful reading in
Boston last night of Bill Corbett reading from a book he made with the
artist John King. Bill showed slides and read from his poems which were
written in response to some hilarious and eerie drawings done by King on
various kinds of hotel stationery. I was really moved by how the two
activated one another's work...both Corbett and King have a minimal,
slightly whimsical and grotesque sensibility, where something recognizable
and slightly cartoonish almost gets depicted but not quite, fighting with
the flatness of the frame or background. One difference perhaps was that
Corbett's work took a more sincere push toward "More emotion" though oddly
displaced, "real like the newspaper / in a collage," whereas King's
drawings are humorously suggestive in the sense that often have a quality
of irony or pastiche to them (one of my favorites depicts a 3-D carton of
eggs delightfully drawn on top of the default stationary's illustration of
suburban types on vacation.) Also, there is a great sense of speed and
movement, or travel, throughout the poems. The ekphrasis in these pieces
take its cues from responding to different aspects of the art, from the
stationery itself (frame or implied context) to associate cues within
various parts of the drawings. But the poems remain right there in their
looking, focused and attentive while meanwhile covering great distances. As
an example, the poem written in response to a surreal drawing of a toothy
cave printed on Brandon Inn stationery goes like this:

Tongue depressor teeth
I'm talking chompers,
heavyweight noshers
cranked apart to disgorge
Brandon, Vermont's outflow.
It's the 802 area code
Stephen A. Douglas's birthplace
just down the road
and there the Otter River
rolls shallowly through Pittsford,
Proctor south to the Battenkill.

Great stuff...

Tim

brief reviews of my reading in San Francisco and all my readings in New
York, by Catherine Daly

1.  geary st. series at caf=E9 melroy

This is a great series in a caf=E9 that's closed when the readings are
given.  In the tenderloin, it is next to a cute bar which has cheap
sangria, across the street from a decent deli / wine store (if you want
some snacks for the reading) and down from a great fish n' chips place.
It is also across from a Goodwill that had some un-picked-over Los
Angeles pottery items from the 50s and 60s before I got to it.

I was really excited to read with Denise Newman and Laynie Browne.  I
read poems from my book from back to front, so I could start with the
female SF artists like Jay DeFeo, move through the e (transcendental
number / floating point / benediction) poem, and finish up with the last
bit of the poem I wrote for PDA w/ wireless (which I would love to beam
& read in San Jose someday).

Denise read fantastic home/architecture poems.  I didn't know her,
although she looked very familiar to me, and perhaps we had been at
something at the same time at some point.  I hadn't known that her
husband was an architect -- she wrote these poems in response to some of
his questioning about her ideas about oh, the process of living,
openness and privacy, natural / made landscape, at least what I got out
of it.  There was also some "pacific rim" aura. =20

Anyhoo, she was saying that her husband was from LA, and that
architecture was so much better here.  While they tear everything down
after a short while, the architect is king.  While in SF there's more
code, zoning, dealing with historic modes, scales, and use of space.
This reminded me of the way that in LA, the writer was supposed to be
king in tv (before reality tv), but a peon in the movies, since a movie
is big budget and collaborative, but there's so much pressure in tv, it
is all (deadline) writing.  In other words, in some places in LA,
various flats and neighborhoods, all there is is architecture, built
environment, or blank slate.  In some portions of the industry, all
there is is writing, as there's no acting or direction.  And now there's
no writing! =20

OK, back to the reading.  Laynie Browne read new work, part from her
novel which is really like poetry IMO, and etc.  She introduced some new
poems which her children were very much a part of as a concentration on
permeability, which I thought was very interesting, because I haven't
thought about that that much in that way.  Thinking forward to the next
little review here, in a way, that permeability, so much more Laynie
Browne, I think, than the idea of collaboration, so much more informed
by motherhood, openness, still does share something with the idea of
sourced poetry and writing with constraints or writing as editing or
reading -- writing as a response to what is experienced in the present,
no matter the source -- in a life lived with children, there they are,
there are their questions, their process of language acquisition, their
developing personalities -- in a life lived with books, there they are!

When I got back I shared via e with my friend Therese Bachand that
Denise Laynie and I were talking about play dates -- they set one up --
I was saying how different the SF play date is from the LA industry play
date -- so competitive here, so much who your parents write for, as far
as the play dates I was in on when I lived (seven years, up to six
months ago) in Park La Brea in a townhouse that backed onto the same
courtyard as the townhouse Ron's writing partner David Kidd (we went to
school together) and his wife (an actress -- Wendy Lawless -- well known
for roles in Heidi Chronicles and All in the Timing in New York), and
hence all their hosted play dates.

Therese said, "They have a community there.  Of course Berkeley is
different from LA." She's so sensible.

It was great to meet or see again in the audience Andrew Joron (who I
read with at Andrew Maxwell's series when it was still downtown at The
Lab, when I got to warm up for Barbara Guest -- one of the poems I read
is online at The East Village -- the one where I make a newspaper
Christmas tree -- http://www.theeastvillage.com/tla/daly/p1.htm), Wendy
Kramer who read at the UCLA Hammer for me, Joe Lease, Rusty Morrison
(bought a book!), and one of my oldest friends in the world, Jay Cross,
with his wife Paige who I hadn't met, who works at Head Start HQ in SF.

OK, this is getting really much longer and time-consuming than expected.

My blog has been sussed out by Jordan Davis, Nada Gordon, and Kent
Johnson, so it is time to make it more public:

Sorry for the long-delayed reply, Kirby -- things ...

:-(

Turns on the teeth and the oleaginous grin.

I think I probably made this up -- Blair doesn't seem to have an "official"
nickname.

The Official Nickname for Margaret Thatcher was The Grocer's Daughter, but I
always thought of her as The Hag of Grantham.

Then there was The Grey Man.

The current Conservative Party Leader, Michael Howard -- and the Tories seem
to be running through leaders faster than a soccer-club on the decline
changes managers -- is known (for complicated reasons and something to do
with the most venomous political put-down ever, delivered by one of his
colleages in Parliament, Anne Widdicomb, who said: "There is something of
the night about Michael.") as Vlad the Impaler.

Even I couldn't better that ...

That particular remark by the Iron Virgin managed to lose Howard the Troy
Leadership contest when he ran against The Foetus, but after the interegnum
of The Fog Sometimes Known As Iain Duncan Smith, he Returned From The Dead
and now leads the Tories.

Heaven to betsy, Kirby, you couldn't make this stuff up.

Well at least, I couldn't.

> Blair sounds good to this ear.  He is coherent, and can hold on to an idea

Oh, he's not dumb-bunny -- he speaks French like a native, has a good
Cambridge law degree, and had the decency to marry a wife even brighter than
he is, and have a stable family life despite being President ... oh, excuse
me, he's still technically called primus inter pares The Prime Minister.

The problem for people like me -- and this is going to slop-over into my
reply to Robert is that  ...

        ... John Smith died much too early, of a heart attack.

(I think I'll leave elucidating that up to dave bircumshaw, who is no doubt
monitoring this thread, to pick-up on -- why should I do all the work?)

Different countries, different problems, Robert.

(Though the vision of The Smile ever admitting he was wrong has to be a sick
joke.)

A major problem is that it simply isn't possible to map the US/UK political
systems one onto the other.

It's not just the President/Prime Minister business, but here, anyone
holding a major political office (apart from the law lords and bishops) has
to be elected, pass the franchise of their fellow-citizens.

From 3,000 miles away, it seems to me that the brightest of the Republicans
are Colin Powell and Condaleeza Rice, and neither was elected and both Bush
are appointees.

Baffling ...

Anyway, what the hell, it's not that all British pols are bright -- god,
some are so dumb you could beat them to death with a 5X2 and they wouldn't
notice -- but there is a core who actually have a couple of brain-cells to
rub thegither.

Blair and Gordon Brown among "New" Labour, Vlad Michael Howard leading the
Conservatives, among others.

But brains ain't everything.

Hm ...

'Nuff for now.

Bush has a nickname for *everyone*, doesn't he? Bet he's
got one for Blair.

Hi Hal - Just as I was packaging up the exchange of books! Can I still send

"There's a saint in the sky" ("John Murphy")


There's a saint in the sky called Valentine
He's in my heart and is in thine
Look to the heaven's and see the stars
Outshine the sun whose light is from afar

Come to our hearts and sing so pure
That God will come divine
And bless us so that we are sure
That I am yours and you are mine

I have seen far too many dead
And dream of graves with vines entwined
I await my lover in her stead
And I will die and she will sigh

Death is useless and we are hear
Our children are our present pain
Kill them all and we will not fear
And live and never die again

You and I will live forever
Our hears two roses deep entwined
Nothing ever shall us sever
Though are faces be long lined

John Murphy he comes walking
Long in step and over hill
Dont listen to him while he's stalking
Other's lovers he will go to hell

John Murphy he lies dying
On a lone and forlorn grave
All his children there are crying
Oh my love you must be brave

John Murphy he has gone
To that fastness in the sky
And his daughters and his sons
Will pray for him in the bye and bye

There's a saint called Valentine
And I am yours and you are mine
Leave the mines and never fear
We will live another year
We will live another year

'Freedom to Marry' activists protest across the countryChristopher
Curtis, Gay.com / PlanetOut.com Network
Friday, February 13, 2004 / 06:41 PM


While major debates over same-sex marriage rage this week in Boston and
San Francisco, activists across the country are hitting the streets and
the Internet to demand the right to marry the ones they love and to
fight the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA), which would
prevent states from recognizing same-sex marital relationships.

In what's being called "Freedom to Marry Week" (Feb. 9-15), same-sex
marriage activists are holding rallies and demanding marriage licenses
from county bureaus.

The Houston Chronicle reported 16 gay and lesbian couples tried getting
marriage licenses on Friday, only to be denied by county clerks.
Similar scenes were reported taking place in Columbus and Toledo, Ohio;
Richmond, Virginia; and several cities in Wisconsin.

More rallies are planned for the remainder of what activists call
"Freedom to Marry Week" (Feb. 9-15). The Equality Campaign,
Metropolitan Community Churches (MCC) and DontAmend.com are behind the
effort.

"If we're going to win this battle, we need to mobilize. Civil rights
struggles have always been won by fighting on the ground," said Andy
Thayer, the national rally coordinator for DontAmend.com.

"The interesting thing is that smaller cities are getting involved in
particular. Clinton, Iowa was one of the first cities on board to
organize," Thayer said.

DontAmend.com also launched a new Web site Friday, called DearMary.com
-- after Vice President Dick Cheney's openly lesbian daughter Mary.

The Web site is calling for readers to submit public letters addressed
to Mary Cheney. The letters will be published online and in newspaper
and magazine ads paid for by money raised via the site.

"DearMary.com brings the battle home for Dick Cheney, literally," said
John Aravosis, creator of the Web site and national co-chair of
DontAmend.com.

In January, the Denver Post reported that Vice President Cheney said he
would support the FMA -- after having said, back in the 2000 campaign,
that the issue of same-sex marriage should be left to the states.

"Vice President Cheney attacks our families, yet seems to think his
family is irrelevant to the debate," said Aravosis. "The vice president
is a hypocrite. He is selling his daughter to the highest bidder in the
name of 'family values.' The American people have a right to know that
this man is no role model for our families or our nation."

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Gil Ott, 53, poet and arts activist

By Gayle Ronan Sims
Inquirer Staff Writer

Gil Ott, 53, who as an avant-garde poet sought surprises in language and
as a community arts activist related better to homeless people than to
academics, died Feb. 5 of complications of kidney disease at the
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Ott lived in Mount Airy.

He worked with other writers, artists, social workers and activists to
create programs and publications that gave voice to the disabled.

As the development director of the Painted Bride Arts Center, Mr. Ott
obtained grants that helped give the center a second life and move from
humble beginnings on South Street to its present home on Vine Street.

Mr. Ott was the director of Liberty Resources, a prominent organization
for people with disabilities. He edited a collection, No Restraints: An
Anthology of Disability Culture in Philadelphia, published in 2002,
which received the Mayor's Access Award.

Longtime friend Eli Goldblatt said: "The opening for the book at the
Philadelphia Art Museum last year was an explosive affair. The disabled
authors, some in wheelchairs and some unable to speak, were energetic
and proud artists, professionals and activists."

Mr. Ott, who was born and raised in Blue Bell, became ill with kidney
disease in 1975, when he had the first of five kidney transplants. He
began to publish his poems in literary magazines and founded Paper Air
magazine, which grew into a venue for avant-garde poets from 1976 to
1990. He also owned Singing Horse Press, a company that published poetry
for almost 20 years.

Mr. Ott produced 12 books of poetry but did not fit into the academic
poetry scene. He seldom gave readings, but when he did, he first lit a
candle and sang silly songs such as "The Moon Doesn't Run on Gasoline"
before he began. His work was profoundly playful.

He was a networker, but not in the ambitious sense: He simply took
pleasure in introducing poets and writers to one another. Philadelphia
poets and critics published a tribute to Mr. Ott and his work in The
Form of Our Uncertainty in 2001.

Mr. Ott is survived by his wife of 16 years, Julia Blumenreich; a
daughter, Willa; his parents, Edwin and Hazel; and a brother, Allen.

A memorial service will be at 2 p.m. Feb. 22 at the Painted Bride Arts
Center, 230 Vine St.

Memorial donations may be sent to Liberty Resources, 1341 N. Delaware
Ave., Suite 105, Philadelphia 19125.

   After the Yemeni Omellette at 6...at 7 i bought a nice copy of Liss' MICKEY MANTLE ALBUM...Hawthorn 1966...5 bucks from a very pleasant black woman..turned down the KOUFAX ALBUM...too jewish...few copies on..almost none as nice as this..i low balled it at 100.00...

  This got me to thinking, thinking, thinkin'...on St. Val's day...somehow of two or three ballet books i've been trying to sell for what seems to me half a score yrs...at least 500 women have looked at this 4to glossy Bolshoi book..which is now down to 20.00...at least a dozen have insisted they would be right back with $$$$...forlorn hope at the altar of commerce...

    This in some way might be an economic issue..but many of these  woman who smile the villianous smile and thank you..are wearing 500 dollar shoes..so i don't think so...rather it seems to me ...that what these women want 16 to 60 is  to a ballerina...and if not in action then in spirit...they are not interested in Ballet...they are not interested in the History of Dance....the only Ballerina that interests them is the moi Bal....they want a quick flash into their fantasy life...the reality of the book would remind them of what they're not..

    Whether this is good or bad...is beyond me...as a bookseller I wouldn't mind shooting a couple of them..esp. the pretty giggly ones who will marry or bed those who rule the planet...as a social phenom..who knows...are men better off...knowing they will never be THE MICK or Dr J...or TIGER...but who have a compulsive interest in collecting the detritus of these careers..and keeping track of every minor statistic...who knows?

    I know woman are infinitely more practical...hemming..cleaning a dish...arranging a room...taking care of a sick child...pretending to please in bed...as sellers of dreams...poets lost.. we can only put out our wares...and let them be scattered to the winds...love you ma..drn...

Typing in a hurry here...I've the same request

I'm reading a new one from Louis Armand called <Malice in Underland> =
worth reading. Excerpts from a review I'm writing...

from 'Private Separations' by Louis Armand

"...for we are given many quotidian details in these poems but are =
finally left with an attenuated argument that leaves the reader with =
much more than mere detail..."

"...it is the 'continuous nerve movie' that is projected on the screen, =
and any moralizing or closure, which aren't necessarily on equal =
footing, is just that from which this author refrains..."

Beyond that John Solt just sent his video 'Glass Wind' about the work of =
Japanese artists Kit Kat and Yamamoto Kansuke, which I can't wait to =
see. Does anyone know of Cid Corman's condition...I've been away and =
haven't heard.=20

Also, Lina has a few poems in the new Drunken Boat coming out next week =
online, along with work by Brian K. Stefans and others.

PRESS RELEASE







Beneath the Underground Books is proud to announce the January 2004
publication of Vernon Frazer's IMPROVISATIONS (BOOK 3), the latest section
of the longpoem he introduced at St. Mark's Poetry Project in January 2001.



IMPROVISATIONS (BOOK 3) continues the high-octane poetic exploration of
sound, sense, consciousness and perception that Vernon Frazer began with
IMPROVISATIONS (I-XXIV). Poets familiar with the work have commented:





"To me, Vernon Frazer's IMPROVISATIONS seems a 21st century 'alternative'
masterpiece unfolding before our eyes. Drawing inspiration from the
Language, Projective and Beat 'Schools', it appears Frazer has mined them of
their treasure, transforming these finer aspects to create a monument which
I think will stand amid the greatest 'avant-garde' works of the 20th and
21st centuries.  IMPROVISATIONS (XXV-L)  is far superior to any Language
Poetry or post-Language Poetry I've ever read, EVER. It is the quintessence
of an evolved Language Poetry. The more I pick up the book, the more I get
out of it."



-Ric Carfagna



Improvisations often avoids overt surface meanings, preferring instead to
allow its rhythmical qualities to try and overwhelm our senses; for if the
senses can be overcome, perhaps the mind can be pulled into another, perhaps
higher, realm of meaning altogether..."



 -Sidereality





"...enjoyable read, very musical. reading through the words, i felt in some
sense lost in a trance created by sound. i don't even know if it matters
whether i understand the surface level of the poems--the motion of the music
will keep me returning to the work."




- William Allegrezza





IMPROVISATIONS (BOOK 3) is currently available from Amazon.com, The Book
House, Inc. and Baker and Taylor. Copies may also be ordered from the
publisher for $12.50 each at:

Hello All-Most of my queries these days seem to be baby-related in one way
or another, and this is no exception.  Without doubt, all baby-associated
words, concepts and images have been thoroughly cliched and co-opted at
this point, yet I still found myself writing this fairly straightforward
Valentine for my son:

(Valentine's Day, 2004)
No Words

                  can match
the tenderness of
this baby's skin,
the delicate branching
vessels pinking the
sleep-fluttering lids,
the fine surface blush
of dreams lightly
coursing, the smooth
breath of being -

beneath the night sky,
under this roof,

at the center of the world.

----

Now, I could have tried to disjunctify this in some way until the language
was sufficiently deranged and the sentiment sufficiently disguised, but
that would seem (to me) to miss the point.  So I have some questions:  How
good is avant-garde poetry at handling matters of deep feeling?  And what
about specifically common feelings-the time-worn biggies like joy, love,
and grief?  Do people have some favorite examples of "innovative" poems
that address themselves to such concerns without irony?  Is it always
necessary to break new ground in "the open field," including new emotional
and perceptual ground (as it were), or is there some point to trying to
capture "what oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed"?

thanks,
steve

Waiting for the Rapture

I was walking through the parking lot
There were many cars, bulbous metal;
Frost was their sweetness,
                                         and a single crow flew
Through the purplish white light
Of the many overhead lamps.

This is great. It really expresses the longing of all creation for the
Parousia - the purplish white light - like royalty and the Great White
Throne and the light of Heaven itself - a precursor to the golden, metal
streets, a parking lot of sorts for all eternity - but not really a parking
lot - a place of continual involvement. Then I think of Dante's Hell and the
frost - ah, lots of imagery here.

Post-Digital Barbie

The recent announcement from Mattel makes it official =96 Barbie is no =
longer
just post-modern, she is now also post-digital. Barbie may have started =
her
existence as the very modern mascot of the post war petrochemical =
products
revolution. She typified an era, an era of hope in man-made substances =
and
nature-taming technologies that would work for the good of humanity. Not
only was she moulded in plastic, she was evangelical about her plastic
existence; a humanity bound by a universal belief in fashion and =
matching
accessories. Barbie was not just a plastic doll, Barbie was a modern =
fiction
that we all played out in our minds, Barbie is an ideas domain. Barbie =
was
the one; and every girl, and some boys, wanted to be like Barbie, to =
dress
like Barbie and to accessorise like Barbie. She had every new product =
that
came out, household appliances, leisure and recreational accessories,
personal grooming and of course fashion apparel. No wonder there is a
t-shirt that reads, 'I hate Barbie =96 the bitch has got everything!' =
She also
had one man in her life, Ken, and we all knew that one day she would =
settle
down with her man, Ken, and live happily ever after.=20

And there has only ever been one Ken. Even through the pluralist =
post-modern
eighties and nineties Ken was always there, her prince in waiting, and
waiting and waiting; yes he was always there. Whilst closure of the =
Barbie
and Ken scenario became even more obscure, and Barbie wore very =
colourful
multicultural attire and broke from the cheer-leader Prom Queen =
stereotype
into adventurous outdoor Barbie, Ken was there pitching the tent or
adjusting her gym equipment or pumping up the tyres of her four wheel =
drive
recreational vehicle. Barbie kept the modernist dream alive in Ken. And
although the 'suburban family Barbie' faded into the background, the
presence of Ken in that faded background kept that one man, one family, =
and
one humanity dream alive. Whilst Barbie may have been fashionably
post-modern layering her fiction with new plastic coloured girl friends =
and
little sisters, there was only ever one man in her life, and only one
eventual inevitable pathway ahead.

But as of Valentine's Day 2004 Barbie has shattered the modernist dream =
and
need for closure; Ken, who has waited so patiently for 43 years, is no
longer her one and only. And whilst post-modern Barbie toyed with =
diversity
we always had Ken to keep the fiction on the straight and narrow. But =
Blaine
has entered the scene, and soon a barrage of uber-Barbie-Boys will join
Blaine and Barbie in her new fiction of multi-partnered existence. We =
are no
longer sure of where her path will lead, or who will be her love =
interest in
the future, perhaps this will only be played out in the minds of the
end-user, where all kinds of possible scenarios can be conjured; this =
had
never been a consideration in the past. Will we ever see a 'pregnant
Barbie', or 'breast feeding Barbie' or Barbie's babies or will Barbie =
stay
childless and single? All of a sudden Barbie is an open book again, an
unknown and uncertain quantity, an exciting array of potentials. Barbie =
has
been virtualised.=20

Barbie has been digitised and distributed via computer networks and she =
has
her own website, http://www.barbie.com, where you can dress her and play
games with her and even hear her talk and sing. Digital Barbie has been
around for a while, but even in the cyberspace she only ever had one =
digital
Ken, and the modernist dream still pervaded the digital era even if it =
had
became more pixelated. Digital Barbie was quick to embrace the new =
digital
technologies. She may have satisfied the need for more interactivity in
popular fictions that they have encouraged, but 'post-digital Barbie',
Ken-less Barbie, freed of the decreasingly significant other, is a
re-problematising of Barbie once again, a 'virtual Barbie'. Virtual =
Barbie
does not mean 'digital Barbie'. Her pathways forward are multiple, her
fiction more multi-linear, her fate unpredictable, her being less =
definable,
her existence more of the moment. But 'virtual Barbie' does not mean
'artificial' or 'unreal' or 'make believe' or 'not there' Barbie, she is
still there, she is still physical, she is still real, she is still =
plastic,
she is still packaged and sold, her many different identities to be =
played
out in the fantasy lives and minds of those who embrace her and her many =
new
male friends and lovers. And what of post-digital Ken, will he turn to
another woman, or alcohol or drugs or religion or join some extreme =
militant
terrorist cell? For his future has also been virtualised. He will not =
just
be waiting on the side lines for Barbie to settle down and slowly slip =
into
suburban bliss.

Barbie drops Ken for Blaine
NEW YORK - After 43 years, the romance is over for Barbie and Ken.=20

The couple's "business manager", Russell Arons, vice president of =
marketing
at Mattel, said that the plastic dolls Barbie and Ken "feel it's time to
spend some quality time apart, but they will still be friends".=20

The truth is that the announcement was prompted by the fact that Mattel =
is
releasing the Cali (as in California) Girl Barbie, arriving in stores =
now.=20

Ken will still be in the picture - but just as a friend.

Whatever.

The important news is that to better reflect her single status, Cali =
Barbie
will wear board shorts and a bikini top, metal hoop earrings, and have a
deeper tan - a style which is already attracting a new admirer, Blaine =
the
Australian boogie boarder.

Arons hinted on Wednesday that the separation may be partially due to =
Ken's
reluctance to get married. - Sapa-AP=20

Third


It's so much later in the evening and I'm trying to decide what to take
to the Brown mini-conf. I'm on the 3rd book of Journey to the West, but I
might leave that in favor of the I Ching, which I want to look at in
depth (re: Legge's version, not Wilhelm's). We found more free books
today including the poems of Gershom Scholem, Ahmed Rassim's The Little
Bookseller Oustaz Ali, poems by Neruda, photos of CBGB etc. in blank
generation revisited, the early days of punk rock, Gabriel Levin's
Hezekiah's Tunnel, a quite old Chinese bowl as well. I don't understand
and I so want to. It is February 14 2004 and I am utterly drained. This
afternoon I rose from a nap feeling ill again. This happens all too
often. After the mini-conf. I will return to the doctors. Again and
again. In Kurosawa's dreams, there are journeys through the wood. I want
to return to Japan. The Economist Pocket series World in Figures doesn't
cover all the countries. That's an error. The shakuhachi is still within
the trumpet case. My headache is getting worse again. I need codeine. The
laptop now has 768 megabytes of RAM and runs considerably faster. I'll
take the Zaurus with the two UML (universal modeling language)
applications. I can work on the real and codework simultaneously,
diagramming my thoughts. I am using sequencing and database diagrams. I
will bring the Cybertext Yearbook almost definitely. But then it may not
be necessary. I may bring the Chomsky. Chances are yes, it will be the
Chomsky. Sat Feb 14 21:12:26 EST 2004

This is the text from which Code@C extracted "Welch leads Houston Ballet

My piece, "Spurned birds and hovering words", appears in the "Living"
section of this weekend's Sunday San Francisco Chronicle. "Pigeons, Poets &
the City(San Francisco)" was the original title of the unedited piece as it
appeared on my blog. The Chronicle did a lovely job with it, including a
very nice visual by Tom Murray.

If you are out of the Chron's reach, the piece will be posted online
sometime on Sunday at:
http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/artlist.cgi?key=LV&directory=/c/a/2004/02/15

If that does not work, let me know.

I have not seen a pigeon on my block all day. Sensitive creatures!

Has it ever occurred to you to wonder just why Kerry was in Nam, given that
with his background, it would have been sweet jeezus easy for him to get
out-from-under in the same fashion as Bush and Clinton?

You can do lots of things, but attempting to portray Bush as a Nam War hero
ain't one.

God help us, I think Bush'll be re-elected for another four years, and then
god help the planet.

Oh hell, the planet will survive.

It'll take more than a nut-hatch Republican draft-dodger elected for a
second term to kill her off.

Partly Writing 3: Expanded Literacies and Writing Arts.

=46ebruary 28th-29th 2004. Centre for Cultural Poetics, University of
Southampton.


In keeping with the premise of the Partly Writing seminars this event will
address questions of writing and public space in the context of a
discussion-led weekend. We have been inviting practitioners and academics
from a range of fields to participate as contributors. We have a few places
left for those of you who would like to take part and could contribute to
the discussions through their own work/research.

Partly Writing 3 specifically addresses the question of literacy: as
cultural competency, as a social currency, as a form of knowledge, as a
process of artistic translation. We are interested in examining how
contemporary writing arts allow for an expansion of our understanding of
literacy and the ways in which it both reflects and produces political,
philosophical, technological and social change.

We are asking all participants: =EBHow (and what) does art teach us to read?=
=ED

Issues and questions to be addressed over the weekend include:

What forms of literacy are being produced by new and emergent forms of arts
production?
How is the relationship between textual and visual culture now to be
understood?
How do issues of difficulty, of access, and of resistance continue to
inform the production and maintenance of literariness?
How is literacy engaged with the other social practices that inform the
thinking and making of work (publishing, editing, collaboration, curation
etc)?
In what ways do forms of knowledge inscribed in the body inform the role
and nature of literacy?

Thank you for passing this along...Once upon a time, my cousin's wife worked
for Mattel in the marketing dept...I don't know what aspect of this she was
involved in, but my mom told me that she was responsible for making a few
changes in Barbie's perceptions...

Post-Digital Barbie

The recent announcement from Mattel makes it official - Barbie is no longer
just post-modern, she is now also post-digital. Barbie may have started her
existence as the very modern mascot of the post war petrochemical products
revolution. She typified an era, an era of hope in man-made substances and
nature-taming technologies that would work for the good of humanity. Not
only was she moulded in plastic, she was evangelical about her plastic
existence; a humanity bound by a universal belief in fashion and matching
accessories. Barbie was not just a plastic doll, Barbie was a modern fiction
that we all played out in our minds, Barbie is an ideas domain. Barbie was
the one; and every girl, and some boys, wanted to be like Barbie, to dress
like Barbie and to accessorise like Barbie. She had every new product that
came out, household appliances, leisure and recreational accessories,
personal grooming and of course fashion apparel. No wonder there is a
t-shirt that reads, 'I hate Barbie - the bitch has got everything!' She also
had one man in her life, Ken, and we all knew that one day she would settle
down with her man, Ken, and live happily ever after.

And there has only ever been one Ken. Even through the pluralist post-modern
eighties and nineties Ken was always there, her prince in waiting, and
waiting and waiting; yes he was always there. Whilst closure of the Barbie
and Ken scenario became even more obscure, and Barbie wore very colourful
multicultural attire and broke from the cheer-leader Prom Queen stereotype
into adventurous outdoor Barbie, Ken was there pitching the tent or
adjusting her gym equipment or pumping up the tyres of her four wheel drive
recreational vehicle. Barbie kept the modernist dream alive in Ken. And
although the 'suburban family Barbie' faded into the background, the
presence of Ken in that faded background kept that one man, one family, and
one humanity dream alive. Whilst Barbie may have been fashionably
post-modern layering her fiction with new plastic coloured girl friends and
little sisters, there was only ever one man in her life, and only one
eventual inevitable pathway ahead.

But as of Valentine's Day 2004 Barbie has shattered the modernist dream and
need for closure; Ken, who has waited so patiently for 43 years, is no
longer her one and only. And whilst post-modern Barbie toyed with diversity
we always had Ken to keep the fiction on the straight and narrow. But Blaine
has entered the scene, and soon a barrage of uber-Barbie-Boys will join
Blaine and Barbie in her new fiction of multi-partnered existence. We are no
longer sure of where her path will lead, or who will be her love interest in
the future, perhaps this will only be played out in the minds of the
end-user, where all kinds of possible scenarios can be conjured; this had
never been a consideration in the past. Will we ever see a 'pregnant
Barbie', or 'breast feeding Barbie' or Barbie's babies or will Barbie stay
childless and single? All of a sudden Barbie is an open book again, an
unknown and uncertain quantity, an exciting array of potentials. Barbie has
been virtualised.

Barbie has been digitised and distributed via computer networks and she has
her own website, http://www.barbie.com, where you can dress her and play
games with her and even hear her talk and sing. Digital Barbie has been
around for a while, but even in the cyberspace she only ever had one digital
Ken, and the modernist dream still pervaded the digital era even if it had
became more pixelated. Digital Barbie was quick to embrace the new digital
technologies. She may have satisfied the need for more interactivity in
popular fictions that they have encouraged, but 'post-digital Barbie',
Ken-less Barbie, freed of the decreasingly significant other, is a
re-problematising of Barbie once again, a 'virtual Barbie'. Virtual Barbie
does not mean 'digital Barbie'. Her pathways forward are multiple, her
fiction more multi-linear, her fate unpredictable, her being less definable,
her existence more of the moment. But 'virtual Barbie' does not mean
'artificial' or 'unreal' or 'make believe' or 'not there' Barbie, she is
still there, she is still physical, she is still real, she is still plastic,
she is still packaged and sold, her many different identities to be played
out in the fantasy lives and minds of those who embrace her and her many new
male friends and lovers. And what of post-digital Ken, will he turn to
another woman, or alcohol or drugs or religion or join some extreme militant
terrorist cell? For his future has also been virtualised. He will not just
be waiting on the side lines for Barbie to settle down and slowly slip into
suburban bliss.

Barbie drops Ken for Blaine
NEW YORK - After 43 years, the romance is over for Barbie and Ken.

The couple's "business manager", Russell Arons, vice president of marketing
at Mattel, said that the plastic dolls Barbie and Ken "feel it's time to
spend some quality time apart, but they will still be friends".

The truth is that the announcement was prompted by the fact that Mattel is
releasing the Cali (as in California) Girl Barbie, arriving in stores now.

Ken will still be in the picture - but just as a friend.

Whatever.

The important news is that to better reflect her single status, Cali Barbie
will wear board shorts and a bikini top, metal hoop earrings, and have a
deeper tan - a style which is already attracting a new admirer, Blaine the
Australian boogie boarder.

Arons hinted on Wednesday that the separation may be partially due to Ken's
reluctance to get married. - Sapa-AP

I suppose I am trying to stay positive this week, so nothing much to write.

I am wondering if there is a living politician that anybody actually admires.  I
would never vote for Ralph Nader because he apparently has never kissed anybody
and I think there is something the matter with this sort of person, but I love
that he has a mind, and that he has principles.  If he were president, we would
have more sidewalks in our new urban developments, the cars would switch to
solar energy (or be well on their way), and I'm assuming he's Lebanese from the
last name??  At least somehow connected, so maybe he could get a back channel
deal to get Al Qaeda to destroy China's growing economy for a while or somethng
and get off our necks.

The only other politician I've admired that I've actually lived concurrently
with is Senator Paul Simon of Illinois.  It wasn't just the bow tie, though that
helped.  I also admired his simplicity and his stubborn insistence.  My gut
instinct was that he was ok.  My gut instinct is that John Edwards is also ok,
but that the rest of the Democrats are real bozos with the possible exception of
Kucinich.  Edwards' wife is also ok, though she looks twenty years older than
him.

Most Democrats think that Bush is an extremely clever sociopath who is using
bait and switch techniques to get Iraqi oil.  I think he is exactly what he says
he is, and nothing more and nothing less.  He's worried about America getting
blown up again, and he has made some reckless and yet daring moves to try to
take down any structural support in terms of a state launching pad that he can
possibly kick down in the Islamic world.

I can't see how he can both be diabolically clever as many Democrats say he is,
and also so completely dumb.  He's one or the other.  I'm voting for dumb, but
honest, and even courageous and trying to do his best.  I don't admire him in an
overall sense as I do Nader, but probably a person who has all kinds of high
principles will never again be elected in this country.  I suppose without high
principles we won't be getting any more poetry from the presidency either.

Kirby,
First, let's get this front piece corrected: Bush is not a sociopath.  =
True, he is misdirected and misguided; equally true, he doesn't think =
the former is true.  Also true, he's na=EFve enough to "honestly" =
believe he's in charge...I neither admire him nor despise him.  I merely =
recognize a puppet when I see one and think, pity he doesn't know the =
extent to which he's being used and manipulated. =20

But you raise a good and valid question: are there living politicians, =
American or otherwise, who are worthy of admiration? =20

From the top of the American former President's list:
Ford
Reagan
Carter
Bush I
Clinton
Bush II

I'd have to say the only truly admirable fellow would have to be former =
U.S. president, Jimmy Carter.  He and his wife have proven to be people =
of character and integrity...but, that doesn't change the fact that =
Jimmy wasn't a great president.  He waffled when he should have gone to =
war.  Perhaps we should say, "thank god!" for his failures, but they =
were failures none the less.

And the rest of the living history chaps are just that...living statues. =
 No qualities worth our time to attempt to preserve for adding to future =
presidents.  But, if you had to choose one of the remaining four to put =
atop the heap, it would have to be Ronald Reagan...not for what he did =
(or didn't do) as president...but because of all the others, Reagan, =
like Carter, had the strength of his convictions.  True, I reject his =
convictions, but that minor point aside, I respected the man's courage =
to stand and be counted, to hold to his beliefs, however misguided those =
beliefs may have been. =20

As far as Nader is concerned, I find he's an opportunist; worse, I =
distrust him.  I mean this is the same chap who misused data about an =
automobile (the Corvair) to flaunt his name before the public and =
attempt to look like a hero.  I don't respect people who are too quick =
to judge and condemn...whether they are condemning people or products. =
As an aside, let me relate a tale (true) about a wealthy citizen in our =
WA state community.  The person in question is a devout =
environmentalist.  And this person, in a business venture, built a =
multi-unit facility, ordering the installation of the latest =
environmentally sensitive, water conserving plumbing facilities.  But, =
when one of the newest, low-volume flush toilets was installed in this =
persons private facilities, that unit was ordered removed and replaced =
by a standard, American Standard flushing model.  The environmental unit =
was fit for everybody but the environmentally sensitive developer.  For =
some reason, and I can't explain why, I put Ralph Nader in that same =
category...let "them" suffer the inconvenience, but don't ask me to do =
that. =20

And who else might be on the list?  Ross Perot...I love the big-eared =
little chap's tale of, "I'm just a common folk."  Ask yourself this: how =
many common folk do you know who were non athletes in H.S., graduated =
with a little better than a "C" GPA from H.S. and then won an =
appointment to the US Naval Academy?  This happens every day in middle =
America, doesn't it?  Mr. Perot's daddy was connected to the Southern =
"cotton" community, and he was connected politically.  So to is Ross =
himself, to the old Louisiana and Texas Dems, now GOPS. =20

And what of Newt G.?  Now there is a loyal citizen...or so he would have =
us believe.  Newt is, after all is said and done, a Constitutional =
savior, at least to hear him tell it.  Yet, here is the simple =
fact...Newt is a short-sighted half-wit who would have been in the front =
of the line voting for cessation in 1861.  He lacks the intellect to =
understand that the strength of his state rests solely in the =
amalgamated strength of the union.  That too is a fault of the Bush =
mogul, Karl Rove.  Mr. Rove honestly believes state's rights trump the =
Constitution. =20

Funny thing about all that to me is neither Rove nor Gingrich, scholars =
in their own right, seem to grasp the USSR's difficulties.  If we are to =
be only 50 states, what makes us different from the current =
disassociated former states of the Soviet Union?  Answer: Nada!

We could easily be 50 Georgian or Ukranian entities each struggling for =
both an identity and a position in the world economy, if we allow the =
state's rights chaps to lead.=20

So, are there others, in other countries, currently alive, deserving of =
one's respect and admiration? =20

Afraid not!  Funny thing about political leadership...it usually is =
bestowed upon the shoulders of those willing to take up the banner of =
the wealthy, or often, those oppressed by the  wealthy, and, in either =
case, we end up with folks who push a private agenda ahead of the real =
issue, the public good.=20

Enough for now.
Alex=20

 Poets Bruce Andrews, Rob Fitterman and Kim Rosenfield will be featured
@Goliath in an evening of readings from their works and more.

Bruce Andrews is "a performance artist and poet whose texts are some of
the
most radical of the Language school; his poetry tries to cast doubt on
each
and every 'natural' construction of language" (The Oxford Companion to
Twentieth Century Literature in English). Andrews is a founding editor
of
the legendary journal L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, which in many ways catalyzed the
new

A reading by internationally acclaimed poet, novelist and playwright

VANCOUVER, B.C.

************
GOH POH SENG
************

"Everybody knows Vancouver is paved with poets, but I haven't seen
this many people turn out for a reading since Allen Ginsberg came to
town. Over 100 people showed up at the Havana Theater to hear Goh Poh
Seng read. You could hear a pin drop- so vivid were his words, so
strong the emotions stirred As with many of his poems, you can see
what he says, half singer, half storyteller."
-poet Billy Little.

At a solo reading at the Dow Library, UC Berkeley, Robert Hass,
former US Poet Laureate introduced Goh as "one of the most important
writers from his part of the world." Remarkably versatile, he is not
only a poet but also an important novelist and playwright. His poetry
has been included in such anthologies as "THE POETIC LANGUAGE:
Anthology of Great Poems of the English-speaking World" , Published
by Macmillan.

The late Charles Causeley, the doyen of the British poetry scene,
included Goh's poetry in his anthology, The Sun Dancing. and praised
Goh's work as "being the very finest. Splendid work!"

"Goh Poh Seng is a Singaporean who has demonstrated that given
sufficient impetus, a man endowed with the gift of expression can
create a literature which inspires and moves by its very insistence
on a refusal to accept realities in any manner that borders on
compromise. The hazards faced by a creative  writer who uses the
resources of a language not natively his own are many and varied; the
risks involved are therefore enormous. However, and perhaps in spite
of this very reason, the few writers who have made good in this
respect, succeed chiefly because undaunted by the pressures
confronting them, they have been able to fuse their experiences in
words that resonate with an unmistakable force their grasp of the
finer shades of the language they choose to write in."
-Hemisphere,  Australia

"A word must be said here about the poet's international ease. He
reaches beyond the constrains imposed by family, country, work, and
seeks and finds new energy, new insights so that he may later return,
renewed."
-New Pacific Quarterly, New Zealand.

Presents

THIS NIGHT=20
a Play in Two Acts
by Robert Majzels

Directed and designed by Ari Weisberg
Starring David Rosser, Howard Jerome, and Jack Kennedy
The Berkeley Street Theatre
26 Berkeley Street, Toronto
March 3-20, 2004

After ten years of failed struggle as a political and union activist, David
Hellman has come home in defeat and humiliation. His older brother Benny,
who stayed home and dedicated himself to building a successful business, is
all that remains of the family. The two brothers rapidly conflict over thei=
r
opposing visions. When the spirit of their dead father is raised, the facts
of his experience in the camps becomes the site of a struggle for meaning.
Which brother has been true to their father's experience as a survivor of
the Holocaust? Which has betrayed the legacy?

From award-winning Canadian author and playwright Robert Majzels comes This
Night, a play in which past and present conflate, history and imagination
are blurred. As in the ancient texts of the Talmud, Majzels presents a
dialogue of differing possibilities, a relentless search for the truth in
the knowledge of the impossibility of ever entirely attaining that goal.

On one level, this play explores the dilemma of the children of the
Holocaust, saddled with a memory they can never entirely call their own. At
the same time, Majzels tells us, we are all survivors of the Holocaust,
struggling with the failure of Western civilization.

Governor-General Award recipient Robert Majzels is an accomplished novelist=
,
playwright, translator, script consultant and teacher. He is the acclaimed
author of various novels including Hellman's Scrapbook (Cormorant Press, ON=
,
1992) and City of Forgetting (Mercury Press, short-listed for the 1998
QSPELL Fiction Award in Montr=E9al). His third novel Apikoros Sleuth, is
slated for release 2004 (Mecury Press and Potes & Poets). His full-length
play This Night won first prize both in the 1991 Dorothy Silver Awards
(Cleveland Ohio, USA) and the 1994 Canadian Jewish Playwrighting
Competition.

Richard Foreman's new play provides one of the best aesthetic articulations
of the possibility for poetry against the war, and specifically the Bush
presidency (imperium in Foreman's vision). Hilarious and disturbing, the
play marks a move outward from Foreman's recent series of brooding,
introspective "traumaspiels", to coin a word for Foreman's particular mode
of overlaid sound/sense/sight/movement. This is poetry in motion  ..
against the war, against the surface coherences that mask the lies that
fuel the war. The fantasy, Foreman shows, is not on the stage at the
Ontological Hysteric Theatre, nor in our poems, but in the ping-pong
between conquest and impotence in the virtual minds of our loss Leader. The
genre is satire but it's an ontological satire, a satire of the psychic
(blank) spaces that explode in our brains the better to numb our
proprioception. Unblind your mind at Foreman's "King Cowboy Rufus Rules the
Universe".

"King Cowboy Rufus Rules the Universe"

Please join us on Sunday, February 22 at 3 p.m. at the District of Columbia
Arts Center (2438 18th Street in Adams Morgan, just south of Columbia Road
on the west side of the street) for a poetry-o-rama with MICHAEL GOTTLIEB
and JESSE SELDESS.

The author of more than a dozen titles, MICHAEL GOTTLIEB's new book, LOST
AND FOUND, has just been published.  His other recent books include GORGEOUS
PLUNGE (Segue) CAREERING OBLOQUY (Other Publications), and MORE THAN ALL
(Tongue To Boot), a collaboration with Ted Greenwald.  One of the central
first-generation Language poets, Gottlieb helped edit the seminal "Roof"
magazine through the 80s.  He presently lives in Northwest Connecticut with
his wife and two children.  Of his new book, Ron Silliman has written, "LOST
AND FOUND is aread-this-and-change-your-life experience: the first great
work to emerge from the trauma of September 11.  Michael Gottlieb's
masterwork is one terrific book."

JESSE SELDESS lives in Chicago where he works in social services for the
elderly, where he edits _Antennae_, a journal of experimental poetry, music,
and performance, and where he co-curates the Discrete Reading and
Performance Series. Recent poems have appeared or are soon to appear in
Crayon, Conundrum, Kiosk, Traverse, Kenning, and First Intensity, and a
chapbook, _Who Opens_, was just printed by Milwaukee's Bronze Skull Press.

Reagan also brought down the Evil Empire.  Most of the countries of the
former East Bloc are much better off as a result.  The one exception
would be the Soviet Union which appeared for a while to be heading back
to a period prior to October 1919 in terms of standard of living.  The
average lifespan of a Russian male in the mid-1990s was 52!  But I do
think all their former colonies have something to be thankful for in
Reagan.

In terms of anti-communism, here's a passage from John Updike from his
novel In The Beauty of the Lilies, spoken by a CIA agent named Danny
Wilmont:

"Was [Vietnam] a mistake?"

"It got us into China," Uncle Danny told him.  "It got us the two SALT
agreements.  We've got Mao and Brezhnev each trying to kiss our ass.
Nobody's supposed to say this, but Vietnam impressed the right people.
The superpowers all agree, the North Vietnamese are pricks.  They've got
Laos.  They won't get Thailand.  They won't get Cambodia, if I can help
it.... Vietnam was a hard call ...  I'm glad you won't have to fight in
it.  But somebody always has to fight.  You and I walk down the street
safe, if we do, because a cop around the corner has a gun.  The kids
today say the state is organized violence and they're right.  But it
matters who's doing the organizing.  King George the III, or George
Washington.  Joe Stalin and his disciples, or our bumbling American
pols.  I'll take the pols, every time.  What the kids don't seem to see
is that their freedom to grow long hair and smoke pot and shit on Tricky
Dick is based on the willingness of somebody else to do their fightng
for them.  What you can't protect gets taken away.  The class or tribe
or country that can't fight gets swallowed up.  I try to be cool about
it -- I mean, look at you, for Chrissake: your hair, that little Mary
Jane leaf on your polo shirt -- but frankly, it pisses me off, Clark,
this whole decadence thing, this whole spoiled stoned slogan-mouthing
generation of rotten know-nothing ingrates, so I'm glad I'm not in this
country for long at a time.  I might turn conservative ...  If your
mother weren't my sister, it would really get my goat the way she and
these other pinko Hollywood fatcats and bleeding hearts talk as if the
late great Ho would suit them just fine.  Let them try it on for a
week.  They'd all wind up in reeducation camp at best...  I try to be
dispassionate about it, but I love this crazy, wasteful, self-hating
country in spite of itself"  (393-394).

I like Updike -- he is dialectical -- the sister of Danny is a Jane
Fonda type liberal - and equally as smart as her brother in some ways.
But what Reagan stood for is in Danny's speech, and I think it's a good
thing to stand for.  Bumbling pols as opposed to the bleeding hearts.
I'll take Bush over Stalin any day.  And somehow in communistic states
you always get Stalin because for one reason or another they have an
optimistic view of human nature, and nature generally.

I prefer the dark pessimists like James Madison, and his federalism, and
the idea that you have to balance out powers because people are
completely depraved.

Kirby,

How can you reconcile a preference for the Madisonian federalist balance =
of powers with the autocratic machinations of George W. Bush? He has =
arrogated to himself powers that Lincoln,
during the Civil War, declined when Congress offered them to him, saying =
that no man should
possess such authority. Bush's foreign policy of preemptive war mirrors =
American policy toward the Native populations in the 18th and 19th =
centuries, and his economic policies hail from the era of
Wm. McKinley.=20

Also, the idea that Reagan brought down the Evil Empire seems bogus. As =
you admit, the Soviet economy had declined precariously--not exactly a =
toothless tiger, but more like a comatose tiger with very big teeth. The =
USSR would probably have collapsed economically anyhow without the =
ability to move food to markets and with the idiotic and irrelevant =
quotas of a planned economy. If you want to credit RWR with busting the =
Soviets, calculate the price: he and Bush, Sr. quadrupled the national =
debt in twelve years. I figure that every taxpayer will have to ante up =
about a week's salary every year in perpetuity to pay the interest on =
that increase in the debt (since no one will ever pay down the =
principal). That means out kids and grandchildren &c, &c, &c. Worth it?
(Hey: Madeline Albright called the death of 500,000 Iraqi children =
"worth the price" of containing Saddam Hussein . . .)=20

And, by the way, what do you make of the fact that Bush claimed on Dec. =
4, 2001, to have watched the first plane hit the Twin Towers?=20

pages

..a sign is always an element of an _expression plane_ conventionally
correlated to one (or several) elements of a _content plane._

Properly speaking there are not signs, but only _sign-functions._

..the classical notion of 'sign' dissolves itself into a highly complex
network of changing relationships.

..under the name of /'code/ the engineer is considering at least four
different phenomena:

(a) A set of _signals_ ruled by internal combinatory laws. (b) A set of
states [of X] which are taken into account as a set of _notions_ .. about
the state of [X] and which can become .. a set of possible communicative
contents.

(c) A state of possible _behavioral responses_ on the part of the
destination.

(d) A _rule_ coupling some items from the (a) system with some of the (b)
or (c) system. This rule establishes that a given array of syntactic
signals refers back to a given state of [X], or to a given 'pertinent'
segmentation of the semantic system; that both the syntactic and the
semantic units, once coupled, may correspond to a given response; or that
a given array of signals corresponds to a given response even though no
semantic unit is supposed to be signalled; and so on.

Only this complex form of rule may properly be called a _'code.'_

hi all,

I had sent some older poems to my friend Jill recently, and she mentioned
the different, yet similar, voice. So i looked on my powerbook to find the
oldest poem i had on it to send her, and I found this one I wrote while
living in Albany, N.Y. in  1991 and 1992. (*I have older ones that are
trapped on old Apple iic discs i printed out from years ago, and in too many
notebooks, as yet untyped.) Enjoy.

hi all,

I just renewed my Sunday plan for the upcoming Mets season and I thought I'd
see if any of you might be interested in buying some of the tickets. I've
been sitting in the same section for the past six, now seven,
years--mezzanine, sec. 2 (behind home plate). I have two tickets for each
game (prices below are per pair), and they're under the overhang, so u don't
get burned in the sun or wet in the rain.

If you're interested in buying any tickets you can email me here. (The Mets
charge diff. prices for diff. opponents, so you'll notice, for example, the
Braves game costs more than the Brewers game.)

*

and, separately, the april issue of boog city is going to have a bunch of
baseball content, including a page of baseball poetry and a baseball poem on
the cover. you can email baseball poems to me by Thursday March 11.

best,
david

Subject:      word species evolution
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        Each word is like a separate species -- not mixing its 'genotype'
(feature strucutre) with that of other words -- and a language is like an
entire ecology. Every word has a 'niche' which is a part of meaning space;
different word species may compete with one another to occupy useful
niches in the space of meanings that people want to express. By combining
productively with other words, a word may effectively expand its meaning
niche and so prosper; this is the selection pressure which has led to the
unbounded productivity of language, and to all of syntax. As the whole of
a language is defined by its word feature structures, evolution of the
words constitutes the whole of language change. The full Oxford English
Dictionary is a museum of (mainly extinct) word species. Each word species
is a parasitic life form, much like a virus. A virus needs a living cell
to host it, and a word needs a human brain.
        As I write, I have individuals from 50,000 separate species of
word parasite in my head, and I am spreading them into this document. You
in turn are absorbing them, because you have individuals from virtually
the same 50,000 species already in your head. Some of these species are
thousands of years old, and some are much younger.

Small Press Traffic presents
Joseph Lease & Chris Stroffolino

The Boston Book Review says Joseph Lease is a writer of "superbly crafted free
verse whose powerful clarities and careful progress of articulation measure up
to the work of William Carlos Williams and Robert Creeley." Lease?s books
include Human Rights and The Room. He?s a frequent reader on NPR and his
essays on poetics are forthcoming in African-American Review and the anthology
TransAmerican Poetries: Experiment and Identity in the Poetry of the Americas.
He teaches at CCA.

Chris Stroffolino is the author of three collections of poetry, OOPS,
Stealer's Wheel and his latest, Speculative Primitive, out this spring from
Oakland?s own Tougher Disguises Press. Stroffolino is also the author of Spin
Cycle, Selected Essays and Reviews: 1989-1999 and co-author of a Cliffnotes
edition of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. He teaches at St. Mary?s and performs
with the band Continuous Peasant, which has just released its debut album,
Exile in Babyville. Check them out at continuouspeasant.com.

and CCA faculty, staff, and students.

and his biography of an Italian war hero. A hilarious blend of  shaggy=20=

"I think all the restraints placed on the CIA since Carter have taken down
our strategic defensive
abilities."

Staements like this have been made ad nauseum without context for the past 2
years. While the limits imposed did restrict some intelligence execution,
some executions needed to be stopped. It's irresponsible to regurgitate the
forementioned statement without also mentioning that the CIA was
internationally notorious for violating national sovreignty(at best) and/or
asassination(at worst). It was an out of control organization in 1976- thus
the reason for the restrictions- not simply to rain on a Republican parade.

Kirby,

I wish I could write Dubya off as just "vaguely goofy," but when he claimed
to have seen the first plane hit, he seems either delusional or a guy who
just let the biggest cat on earth out of the bag. He described viewing the
first plane in a pretty detailed way for 'just a mistake.' It seemed
different from his own "misunderestimated" malapropisms or the
down-in-flames non sequiturs of Dan Quayle (though I do detect a similar
glassy earnestness and vacancy in both of them--akin to the pod-folks' in
Invasion of the Body Snatchers).

Mr. Vaguely Goofy has bullied his way through the china shop, turning
America and its future into shimering, scalpelsharp rubble. Like Buster
Keaton in the famous shot where a barn falls 'round him while he remains
unharmed and unperturbed, Mr. Getting-More-Precisely-Goofy-Every-Day will
likely amble out of the frame into a golf cart and make his leisurely escape
from the geometrically exponential carnage.

The fact that his claim about the plane actually appeared on the official
White House web page seems even more scary than having a demented chief
executive--how could anyone fail to catch such an astonishing "goof"?
Another "failure of intelligence," like the WMD fiascos? Has the White House
become a whole menagerie of morons?

Bush ought to have faced impeachment long ago. He's done much, much worse
than lie to Congress about his indiscrete congress with Monica Lewinsky. See
http://www.rise4news.net/Impeachment_Resolution.html
and
http://www.redrat.net/BUSH_WAR/clark.htm
If these bills of impeachment don't convince you that Dubya rates more than
a "vaguely goofy," what does it mean to have laws at all? Nixon famously
said, "If the president does it, that means it's not illegal." Do you
believe that? Should anyone?

I think we need to make "wonderful leaps" in order to see what the ruling
class does behind out backs--as well as right under our noses. I hope my own
leaps achieve a balletic crispness rather than an Evel Knievel/Wile E.
Coyote denouement. Conspiracy theorist, eh? (Ken who? said Dubya re his pal
& biggest contributor, Enron pasha Lay.) Well, yeah.

Dan

I came across this. is Arielle Greenberg still on this list? I'd like to
hear her response to the accusation that experimentl poetry is getting a
short schrift. somehow i think that the students think that slam style is
experimental.

k.

Students raise issues with poetry spinoff
Students concerned about creator’s absence

http://www.ccchronicle.com/back/2004-02-16/campus1.html

Shortcomings in the new poetry MFA could force students to consider
whether or not they will reapply for the master's program, students told
The Chronicle.

Complaints stem from inconsistent grading, a lack of diverse curriculum,
interdepartmental politics, favoritism and false advertisement of what to
expect in the program.

One of the most frequent complaints includes concerns about the absence of
Paul Hoover, an internationally-acclaimed poet who developed the English
Department's undergraduate program 27 years ago and who recently proposed
and constructed the MFA.

Some say the complaints could be the result of a new program that needs to
develop over time, before evolving into a widely-accepted degree.

Others disagree.

Armand Capanna, a recent graduate of Columbia's undergraduate poetry
program, said he refuses to apply to the MFA program due to problems he
saw developing as early as a year ago.

“When you're applying to the program … you know you're entering into a
program that is headed by a man who has an intellectual reputation,” he
said. “We all took classes with Paul in the fall, so we knew he was open
to all kinds of poetry.

“We [knew] we would want to be taught by someone like that—someone who
knew how to push us.”

But Hoover wasn't there in the fall. According to Hoover, due to several
layers of political disagreements, he left before the MFA program started
in order to consider a teaching job in San Francisco, where his wife
permanently resides.

Without Hoover's presence, Capanna said, the MFA program seemed
unbearable. Capanna completed his bachelor's degree while the first
semester of the MFA took place. He said he grew more displeased with the
program, listening to MFA students offer complaints about unfair grading
and a bias against certain writing forms.

Ric Cleary, an MFA student, told Capanna that a teacher stopped grading
his poetry near the end of the semester, because, according to Cleary, the
teacher didn't consider the student's work “art.”

“You do not pay 12 grand-plus a year to get that [type] of critique,”
Capanna said.

Cleary told The Chronicle that he also was unsatisfied with the program,
especially with the installation of, what he said was, an “unqualified”
program coordinator. The English Department named David Trinidad, also a
highly-acclaimed poet, the acting coordinator of the poetry MFA program in
Hoover's absence.

“Under the current leadership of the program, it is clear that the program
is striving to eliminate any [poetic] aesthetic that is … experimental,”
Cleary said.

Cleary described anger from classmates about the elimination of Hoover
from the program.

“There was a lot of bewilderment, especially from former students who had
[Hoover] as an undergrad,” he said. “We expected to be taken to the next
level under Paul Hoover.”

Other students disagreed, saying that the success of a program doesn't
rest on one man.

According to Sean Flynn, 26, a 2002 political science graduate from DePaul
University's undergrad program, the poetry MFA is what he expected,
because he had nothing to compare it to. Flynn said he is “99.5 percent”
satisfied with the department and the program, and he thinks that some of
the complaints come across as minor issues.

“I don't know who [Hoover] is,” he said. “His lack of presence is totally
irrelevant.”

Sue Kurek, 24, a recent creative writing graduate from Loyola University,
agreed the MFA is a strong program despite its fledgling status.

She said, compared with the writing programs she has experienced in the
past, Columbia's poetry department employs a strong focus in the arts.

“The teaching faculty at Columbia in the poetry program are superior
compared to what I have come across in the past,” she said.

Complaints that show concern for the program are part of the transition
that every new college curriculum addition experiences, according to
English Department Chairwoman Garnett Kilberg-Cohen.

She said she was surprised to hear about complaints regarding teaching
diversity because of the diverse poets she employs on staff.

Each school year, the English Department solicits and hires
poets-in-residence or visiting poets, which allow students to learn from
some of the most respected professionals in the industry.

The department hired poet Arielle Greenberg this fall as a full-time
artist-in-residence. Trinidad was hired after serving as a visiting poet
to Columbia.

Whether or not the newly-implemented program can be condemned, the issue
seems divided between the arguments by students for and against the poetry
MFA. Students who spoke with The Chronicle agree that the department
should hear their concerns and that changes should be made if the program
wants to thrive.

Kevin Hogan, a January 2000 graduate of Columbia's undergraduate poetry
program, signed up for the MFA because he wants to teach. He also was
turned on to the idea of Hoover's involvement in the program, the respect
Hoover received from students and other poets and Hoover's tendency to try
new things.

Hogan echoed the concerns of Cleary and Capanna, reiterating that some
teachers tend to discourage experimental poetry, a type of writing that he
feels should be instructed.

But the MFA neglected to meet several of Hogan's expectations for the
program based on information he was given about the program structure.

The program promised fewer students than the number that was enrolled for
the fall, he said. In one poetry workshop class, a class that depends on
the critiques of individuals' poetry, 18 people were enrolled.

Sharing graduate classes with undergraduate students also was a concern,
because some undergrad students show disinterest in the things that grad
students need to focus on, he said.

“There's a danger, if they're not careful, of losing a lot of the goodwill
that was built throughout the years,” Hogan said. “There's a fear that
very experimental poetry … is not being given the same attention that
traditional poetry is.”

But the department organized a town hall meeting so students could choose
classes they would be interested in, Kilberg-Cohen said. Although there
shouldn't be reason for concern, Kilberg-Cohen said that students should
come to her with problems.

“[The program] has been going fantastic,” she said. “We have a diverse and
interesting group of students, all of whom are very talented.”

Hoover said he feels the department isn't handling the MFA as
appropriately as possible in his absence, and he's afraid how it might
affect students.

“There's some question about the temper of the program now,” he said.
“There must be some sort of anger toward me.”

Hoover is worried about the level of instruction teachers are giving the
students now that he isn't consistently in the department, due to reports
about selective and bad grading.

“My not being there is a loss for the students, as a senior figure and as
a good teacher,” Hoover said.

But he can't come back because of thick politics that he said forced him
out in the first place.

“It's important to remember that the college is run on a business rather
than academic model,” Hoover wrote in an e-mail to The Chronicle. “Chairs
remain in power for many years, sometimes for a lifetime, and the
chairmanship of a department rarely rotates even when there are elections.
This model results in a powerless faculty and excessively powerful
chairs.”

His current position of visiting professor of creative writing at San
Francisco State University is set to end in fall 2005. Hoover plans to
decide whether or not he will return to Columbia at that time.

Until then, he said he will fight for his program.

“I'm worried that these students' careers are in jeopardy,” he said.

Trinidad and Acting Graduate School Dean Keith Cleveland didn't return
calls from The Chronicle regarding their reactions to the first semester
of the poetry MFA program.

This is a very disturbing post.  The implications for the
program-in-question are pretty serious.

For a casual US reader, it can also be confusing and appear to refer to
the MFA program at Columbia University  in New York City.  And the best
known "Chronicle" in these parts is The Chronicle of Higher Education, a
national publication of wide circulation among US academics (especially
those seeking grants).

So-- my first take was shock.

Fortunately, I read further and clicked on Kevin's source.  In true NIMBY
(not in my back yard) fashion, I was relieved to see that this post is
about Columbia College of Chicago that is infested with the dissention
and not the more familiar Columbia University --

and that the Chronicle in question appears to be the school newspaper.
(Sigh).  Not that anyone would want to wish this on any MFA Program.  But
at least it is important to know which one we should be sighing over.

Funny this comes up: recently I went to the Nuyorican Poets Cafe to hear
what I could hear... and was surprised to hear and see many, many white kids
from the Columbia (the NYC one) and NYU there to perform their slam and rap,
and hip-hop forms, many of them beginning by making claims that these "avant
poetries", this "poetry of the future" is neglected by the MFA programs at
their schools.

Incidentally -- and curiously enough-- the evening was introduced by Miqual
Algarin by his reading a poem by Donne. I couldn't help but wonder if those
readers that followed hadn't missed the point of HIS informed and
revolutionary greeting.

This month, a burst of four publications from The Gig:



THE GIG #16
(February 2003)



As always, a 64pp lo-fi chapbook packed with fresh poetry, essays and =
reviews:
    a.. A 39-page poetry section that includes three long poems - =
Nathaniel Mackey's "Song of the Andoumboulou: 62," John Wilkinson's =
"Cit=E9 Sportif" and Ben Friedlander's "For the Daughters of Memory" - =
and new work from Camille Guthrie, Maggie O'Sullivan, Peter Jaeger and =
Simon Perril.
    b.. Keston Sutherland's essay "Prosody and Reconciliation," =
concerning Giorgio Agamben's "The End of the Poem" and Simon Jarvis's =
"Prosody as Cognition."
    c.. Chris Goode's review-essay on Kenny Goldsmith's Day, and briefer =
reviews of Flood and Tinfish publications by Nate Dorward and Will =
Montgomery.

Prices:

in Canada: $7.50 Cdn; 3-issue sub $20 Cdn
in the US: $6 US; 3-issue sub $16.50 US
overseas sub: =A312 or 16.50 euros
(postage included in all prices)

(Address given below)

Three new chapbooks from Peter Larkin:

SPROUT NEAR SEVERING CLOSE

WHAT THE SURFACES ENCLAVE=20
OF WANG WEI

RINGS RESTING THE CIRCUIT


These sequences offer speculative responses to three different sets of =
preoccupations: sproutlands and reseeding; the poetry of Wang Wei; the =
figure of a ring lying across the surface of the earth. Each develops =
its own separate prosody and syntax in response to its subject-matter, =
from the compact lyric style of What the Surfaces Enclave of Wang Wei to =
the dense rings of language (punched-through with holes) of Rings =
Resting the Circuit. These booklets offer a three-way view of the =
development of Larkin's poetry in the wake of his major collection =
Terrain Seed Scarcity (Salt, 2001) and Slights Agreeing Trees (Prest =
Roots, 2002), both of which were focussed on prose-poetry. Sample poems =
from each book are included below.

Prices: Available as a set for $14 Cdn / $13 US / =A310 / 14 euros, or =
else individually:

Sprout Near Severing Close. $7 Cdn / $6 US / =A34.50 / 6 euros.
What the Surfaces Enclave of Wang Wei. $4 Cdn / $4.50 US / =A33.50 / 4 =
euros.
Rings Resting the Circuit. $6 Cdn / $5.50 US / =A34.25 / 5.50 euros.



All prices include postage is included. Please make cheques out to "Nate =
Dorward" and send to:

From Sprout Near Severing Close:

10

How the forest smacks
now I never see the noose of cut
without a lessened forest
round its head!

Left to vice of upturn
at the clinch of last cutting.
Tamed if busily maimed layer:
unguttedly so refocal a scout of shear.

A round of nature
filling small opens in the woods
with what has refallen
diminished upright.

Sembles the upward
with no amplitude
behindwood.

Pine-shadowed but unclad,
the stain the clearing offers if it is in
caseless seedless sprout of.


From What the Surfaces Enclave of Wang Wei:

1

Water-flowers duplicates hardy
at stillness. And then through
greens of oak and pine
we may dispose a way home.
Only the stream follows it
drowned to the world.

Brash under pine retains
ranks in dust of the sown.
If the valley is empty
few come home to the cold,
preferring refuge at the rim.

Bruise the distance from city walls,
all you will see make hills of.
Remote barrage is hills
round my door, past
its mouth to the tall trees.



From Rings Resting the Circuit:

1

That the ring lights crevice
sits to exposure    in round face:
opens    alignment a rind
at trait of bind.

Nakeder entrance as disk reels
hollow off, a plenty    the emptied drum
hears on surface,    as situate
gone out: outbrow within what is
siltless round rim.

Open barrier swirl
stars by rotary obstruct
without queueing    the curvate spot, all
oval
since slides the soil.

An opening you did not
transect, sufficiency
to eject is by
one detentive particle:
hollow versal    in rounds
silent,    unsalient
with verge, rung
the clearing bar to put
curves past
blocks of sieve.

It circles the unpassing a ring is not
roof of:
is lain rootless punct-
ure go through    vertical,
lance    it pore -
off impervious plain.

Not weaker a
not freed across over-
lyings, rescind to this
hollow due:    least attached the
hold does    owe it eye. Un-
riven resting
the deadspin through.

(apologies as usual to those who get multiple copies of this flier....)

In addition to the recent publication of issue 16 of The Gig and three =
new chapbooks by Peter Larkin (see previous email, or, if you didn't get =
it, write me at ndorward@sprint.ca for a copy), there are two =
forthcoming books to announce: Allen Fisher's Entanglement and a major =
book of essays on Canadian women's experimental poetry.  Both of these =
books urgently need advance support from subscribers.=20



Forthcoming in Spring of this year:


Allen Fisher

ENTANGLEMENT

A major event: a new 300pp collection of work from the poet Allen =
Fisher's Gravity as a consequence of shape, the project that has =
occupied him since the early 1980s.  Entanglement picks up where his =
last full-length collection, Dispossession and Cure (Reality Street, =
1994), left off, bringing together the many fugitive publications of the =
past decade that appeared from Fisher's own Spanner press and other =
small presses, as well as many previously uncollected poems. =
Entanglement may be ordered at the reduced advance price of $25 Cdn / =
$19 US / =A315 / 22 euros. All prices include airmail.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------



Forthcoming in Spring, 2005:

A collection of essays on women's=20
experimental poetry in Canada


This will be The Gig's third collection of critical essays, following =
successful past publications focussing on the poetry of Peter Riley =
(2000) and Tom Raworth (2003).  This book will take a look at what's =
some of the most interesting experimental writing going on in North =
America: it will include discussion of a number of well-known authors =
but also draw attention to the work of many less-celebrated writers. =
Writers to be discussed include Lisa Robertson, Karen Mac Cormack, Erin =
Mour=E9, Lissa Wolsak, Lise Downe, Margaret Christakos, Alice Burdick, =
Susan Clark, Catriona Strang, Nancy Shaw, Mary Annharte Baker, Nicole =
Brossard, Christine Stewart, Dorothy Trujillo Lusk, Maxine Gadd, Rhoda =
Rosenfeld, Judith Copithorne, and many others. Many of these poets will =
contribute critical or poetics writings to the volume; there will also =
be essays by Caroline Bergvall, Michael Boughn, Gerald Bruns, Ted Byrne, =
Chris Daniels, Roger Farr, John Hall, Alan Halsey, Reg Johanson, Peter =
Larkin, Jay MillAr, Miriam Nichols, Peter O'Leary, Scott Pound, Susan =
Schultz, Pete Smith, and others. It will also include reprints of some =
hard-to-find material, and a detailed bibliography. The book will be =
approximately 250-300pp in length.

Anyone who's dealt with the Canadian arts-funding system won't be =
terribly surprised to learn that my efforts to get the Canada Council =
and the Ontario Arts Council interested in funding this book have gone =
nowhere.  In other words, this book is purely dependent on advance =
subscriptions and donations.  So: please subscribe in advance to the =
book. The advance price is $25 Cdn / $19 US in North America; overseas: =
=A315 / 22 euros (all prices include airmail). This amount may of course =
be increased by anyone who wishes thus to support the venture - such =
support will be acknowledged.

Please send subscriptions, donations & inquiries to:

Nate Dorward
109 Hounslow Ave, Willowdale, ON, M2N 2B1, Canada
ndorward@sprint.ca   //   www.geocities.com/ndorward/


IN OTHER NEWS..... Other projected Gig publications include a book/CD =
retrospective of the work of cris cheek, and books by Susan Clark and =
Christine Stewart.  If you're enthusiastic about our publishing program, =
please consider becoming a supporter - write ndorward@sprint.ca for more =
information.

It has not happened... it could not happen
it is happening...

7 dollars @ 730pm
Monday February 23, 2003 @ Valentine's
The Urban Carnival will explode from the Albanian unconscious
w/ juggling, poetry, costume, dancing, singing, mock sacrifices of sacred
rubber duckies, and of course the mayhem (we cannot forget the mayhem)

Rumor is that poets of great local fame will be stopping by... I do not want
to give anything away but maybe some blues without greens, maybe reborn
Shamantic warriors... maybe even someone from the late night crew dressed in
black, taking long drags from a clove... maybe no one will show up...  who
knows? Certainly the captain of this ship of fools is a one armed dwarf & he
is throwing dice along the wharf.

Rockets & Bluelights (yes, they shall be present). & the Dresden Dolls? of
course. The word on the street is that Amanda of the Dolls will be bringing
a whip to punish all those who refuse to have fun.

see you there @ the Urban Carnival

Ian

Daniel, I don't see the geometrically exponential carnage.  Perhaps I'm naive.
I suppose I'm more worried about what non-Americans are going to do than what
Americans are going to do to me.  I think that all Americans from Chomsky to Pat
Buchanan to Al Sharpton are trying to think about helping the country, but they
are working from different presumptions, and working from within different
factions.  People outside the country are not necessarily interested in helping
out.  So I am more worried about them. But all the factions inside the country
have a vested interest in keeping the country afloat.  Letter 10 of Madison's
acknowledged that there would be factionalism, but that a confederation would
only be helped by more and more factions.  Through that, any one faction would
be somewhat diluted.  I don't see Bush's faction as having very much power.  If
they go too far, they will get voted out.  He's been extremely moderate in fact
and is clearly working within the Just War Tradition.  Compare Ceausescu who had
children holding candles around Bishop Tokes house shot down on December 24
1989.  The Romanians went berserk.  This sort of thing doesn't work.  Bush is
being fairly careful, I think, if you allow the comparison.  For your faction
you will have to admit that there is nothing that any Republican could ever do
right.  On the other hand, I like all Americans.  Bush?  He's just a little
goofed up due to the CIA being such a pack of hapless bozos these days. What we
need is the return of Maxwell Smart to stop all this KAOS.  I miss Agent 99,
too.  The CIA reminds me of well-intentioned nice guys like Chevy Chase.  They
don't have the cleverness of Max and Agent 99.  When they play golf, their clubs
don't even double as walkie-talkies!

Golfing is a very pleasant activity.  I like it, too.  It's also good for people
with disabilities in that everybody gets to have a handicap.  There are only
three more months to wait for the opening swing!

Best,  Kirby

WHO: For teen guys, 12-19
WHAT: The follow up to Revolve, the Bible for teen girls that looks like
a
fashion magazine, REFUEL is a Bible for teen guys in the same magazine
style
format.
WHEN: Pub date March 2004/ In stores April 2004
** A Bible-zine for women, called Becoming, will release in June 2004.

REFUEL: The Phenomenon Continues
Teen Guys Asked For It and Now It's Here

(NASHVILLE, Tenn.)  In 2003, the Bible publishing industry was turned
upside
down with the release of Revolve: The Complete New Testament, a Bible
for
teen girls that looks like a hip magazine. Despite only being in the
marketplace for six months, Revolve was the #1 best-selling Bible of
2003  -
to the surprise and delight of its publisher, Transit/Nelson Bibles
(Thomas
Nelson). Nearly everyone who got their hands on Revolve (including The
New
York Times magazine and NBC's The Today Show) asked, "Will there be a
guys'
version?"

The answer is a resounding YES, and it's about to hit bookstores
nationwide,
taking teen guys by storm. It's cool, timely, and fashionable; it's the
Bible packaged in an easily-digestible form. Refuel (March 2004,
Transit/Nelson Bibles (Thomas Nelson). $16.99, 0-7180-0676-3) is
designed to
meet teen guys where they are with relevant topics alongside the
Scripture
of the New Testament in the easiest to read translation of the New
Century
Version.

A recent survey conducted by the National Study of Youth & Religion
(http://www.youthandreligion.org/index.html) states that it is an
incorrect
stereotype that teens are disconnected from organized religion-and that
it's
getting worse. Their study shows that "the majority of 12th graders in
the
U.S. (approximately 2/3) do not appear to be alienated from or hostile
toward organized or established religion." Refuel is here to meet the
needs
of young men who are interested in what the Bible has to say, yet rarely
crack the leather-bound edition, much less carry it to school or to
their
youth group.

Refuel, with photos of a guitar and young guys on its cover, contains
information that guys are looking for, such as:
.       Inside Her Head: Real Girls Give Their Opinions
.       72 Lists: On Everything
.       Look Cool: Tips on Your Self
.       Dive In: How to Make Your Faith Real
.       140 Ways to Walk the Walk

The Bible-zine, a term coined by Thomas Nelson to describe this new
genre of
Bibles, also contains information on serious topics, such as sex, rape,
drugs and hazing. Refuel was written by youth pastors and has passed the
"cool test" from teen guys across the country.

"When Revolve was released, we had emails pouring in, asking us to
create
the same type of product for guys. It's hard being a teen male. There's
a
great deal of pressure to be and look cool," explains Laurie Whaley,
spokesperson for Refuel and Brand Manager for Nelson Bibles. "The guys
who
have seen Refuel are really glad they have a resource to turn to during
this
time of life."

all I know about Columbia is that they put out a very good literary
magazine.  i hope this continues, whether the MFA does or not.

in any case, best wishes to all centers, peripheries, margins, orrerys,
conventions, and what-have-yous of poetry tonight.

Richard Foreman and I met in his SoHo loft one morning in October 1987. We
talked all day -- about his influences, his conception of play writing and
the theater, and in particular his relation to poetry. It was around the
time I was writing "Artifice of Absorption", so some of the ideas from that
work come into the conversation as well -- "frustration and paradise". Our
conversation was originally published in TDR in its Fall, 1992 issue. We
have now made this available at Ubuweb.

Dear Friends: I am working with Mark Eisner to raise
funds for a remarkable documentary on Pablo Neruda.
Mark also edited the “The Essential Neruda,” published
by City Lights. He is making a wonderful offer below:

Make a $25 or more donation to the new Neruda
documentary “¡Neruda! ¡Presente!” and receive a copy
signed by editor Mark Eisner mailed to you as soon as
they are released.

I hope you are interested and more info can be found
at:
www.nerudadoc.org

The site also has ordering information.

Thanks,
Ram Devineni

Ariel Dorfman, author of Death and the Maiden on “The
Essential Neruda:”

“What better way to celebrate the hundred years of
Neruda's glorious residence on our earth than this
selection of crucial works - in both languages! - by
one of the greatest poets of all time. A splendid way
to begin a love affair with our Pablo or, having
already succumbed to his infinite charms, revisit him
passionately again and again and yet again."

As part of the Pablo Neruda Centennial Project, this
new book of translations of Neruda’s poetry into
English has been crafted. The book is like a red poppy
and features nearly 50 of Neruda’s most essential
poems, if such a distinction can be made.

It includes translations by Robert Hass, Forrest
Gander, Stephen Mitchell, Stephen Kessler, John
Felstiner, Alastair Reid, and Jack Hirschman. It is
edited by Mark Eisner, whose translations also appear.
Lawrence Ferlinghetti will provide an introductory
note.

As Gregory Rabassa, extensive translator of Latin
American literature from Mario Vargas Llosa to Gabriel
García Marquez puts it: "a translation is never
finished...it is open and could go on to infinity."
While the original poet's pen frames the words, the
translator transforms, but does not cast them. It is
an ongoing procedure, an ongoing art, visiting
previous attempts and choices, then molding them with
new perspective. Edmund Keeley, prominent translator
of Greek poetry, wrote: "translation is a moveable
feast...there must always be room for retouching and
sharpening that image as new taste and new perception
may indicate."

The discovery and affirmation of those new perceptions
were achieved through this project’s collaborative
effort. Scholars across both North and South
America—Nerudianos—were asked to participate in the
project, forming a bridge linking academics, editor,
and poets.

The results are brilliant poems.

Stanford's Center for Latin American Studies,
Department of Spanish and Portuguese, and Creative
Writing program have all helped fund this project.

Donate $25 or more and receive a free copy of the book
in April! WWW.NERUDADOC.ORG

> RINGS RESTING THE CIRCUIT
>
> These sequences offer speculative responses to three different sets of =

> its own separate prosody and syntax in response to its subject-matter, =
> from the compact lyric style of What the Surfaces Enclave of Wang Wei to =
> the dense rings of language (punched-through with holes) of Rings =
> Resting the Circuit. These booklets offer a three-way view of the =
> development of Larkin's poetry in the wake of his major collection =
> Terrain Seed Scarcity (Salt, 2001) and Slights Agreeing Trees (Prest =
> Roots, 2002), both of which were focussed on prose-poetry. Sample poems =
> from each book are included below.
>
> Prices: Available as a set for $14 Cdn / $13 US / =A310 / 14 euros, or =

>
> The answer is a resounding YES, and it's about to hit bookstores

> Version.
>
> A recent survey conducted by the National Study of Youth & Religion

> needs
> of young men who are interested in what the Bible has to say, yet rarely
> crack the leather-bound edition, much less carry it to school or to
> their
> youth group.
>
> Refuel, with photos of a guitar and young guys on its cover, contains
> information that guys are looking for, such as:
> .       Inside Her Head: Real Girls Give Their Opinions
> .       72 Lists: On Everything
> .       Look Cool: Tips on Your Self
> .       Dive In: How to Make Your Faith Real
> .       140 Ways to Walk the Walk
>
> The Bible-zine, a term coined by Thomas Nelson to describe this new
> genre of
> Bibles, also contains information on serious topics, such as sex, rape,

hi,
i didn't mean to mislead anyone or bait and switch with the link to the
article about Columbia College. I it didn't even dawn on me that there
would be another one. I was more interested in the comment that
experimental poetry wasn't being supported. I know Arielle Greenberg's
work and was a bit perplexed by the comment.

It points, i think, to something that is often discussed up here as
"academic poetry". what the slam/spoken word folks call academic
poetry, the progressive poetix types call official verse culture. it
doesn't have much to do with the academy at all.

anyway, i'm jsut working out a few things in my own head.  until the storm
hits. 30-40 cm of snow then 5mm of rain cradled in 70-100km/h winds.

lovely.

thanks,
kevin

No, I don't think so.  By and large, I was satisfied with the program at
Purdue. I also have some familiarity with the program at Cornell, which
has many strengths especially in terms of funding and freedom of choice
as far as curriculum is concerned.
I briefly had the opportunity to participate in the design of the
program at the University of Mississippi and took the question of false
advertisement very seriously.

I'd love to have the opportunity again to participate in a significant
way in the design of a program: I have many ideas, sound I think.  I
tend to see the making of an MFA program as an act of idealism rather
than a cynical exercise.  I think there are programs which reflect a
similar idealism.  The most unhelpful attitude I have found in relation
to MFA programs is cynicism, whether at the design level, or in
practice.

Next time I hope. The Poetry Project will have a celebration of the coming
out of the anthology on May 12. I will let you know as soon as the book is out.

My latest tussle with "academic poetry" definitions here is oddly
complicated by David Trinidad's teaching at Columbia Chicago, as he came
to national attention out of Beyond Baroque.  Beyond Baroque does offer
free workshops and readings.

In any case, it is interesting at least for me to note that by and
large, except for a few excellent poets who are local *stars,* the slam
poets are not performance poets, and the performance poets aren't
performers.  The difference between a performance poet and an academic
poet is generally a college degree.  Nothing to do with the poetry.  It
gets a bit confusing, too, since so many actors without degrees here
used to be performers and write poetry I'd say participates in "official
verse culture."  Many of the slam poets, however, are either teens (not
in college *yet*) or have been to college.

This is one of the reasons, too, there are so many and popular noncredit
workshops in LA (many teachers and students haven't been to college or
if so, not graduate school).  Some of my students tell me they are told
by workshop leaders that after years of study they might be good enough
to "graduate" to an accredited course of study (100-level classes like
those at UCLA Extension).  Thus, there is a great deal of resentment
toward writing in an academic environment, no matter how or what.

A few individuals who have "come out" of this "scene" have almost
secretly pursued AAs, BAs, and MFAs in online programs.

The popularity of postmodernism, theory, constrained writing,
appropriation, etc. has led to a convergence between what the most
informed nonacademic poets are writing and what the average 20 something
poet from a program open to experiment is writing.  David Trinidad's
work, and collaborative work, represented that for me 15 years ago....
Seems like he's in the right place, doing the right thing.

All best,
Catherine Daly

Ok, this is partly sour grapes because no one responded to my stimulating
query about "deep feeling" and avant-garde poetry (even tho I did get some
nice back-channels about the poem I posted) but this whole blogging thing
seems to be getting out of hand.  Everyone's off blogging themselves!  And
who has time to visit a zillion different blog sites to see what people

It has nothing to do with slam poetry.  It has to do with what the article
says, that certain professors in the program aren't open to experimental
poetry. MC

you can roll the blogs you want to monitor into a newsgroup that gets
e-mailed to you -- see, I just used up all my POETICS posts today, and I
have to be online all day today because my two online classes started
yesterday & because I'm home sick --

I'm a reluctant blogger myself, but I do send a lot of e-mail to
students and friends about poetry, and I do have all this scrap paper
around my desk with writing on it, and it is too time-consuming to write
it all up as essays and reviews

to make this post count then, I looked up your post, in the archive,
under the poem

Why don't you read my book?  Aldon Neilsen on... the book jacket says I
have something to say about deep ... feeling.  On my blog is some stuff
I wrote for my Guggenheim app and app to that cox thing that explains
what I think a bit more --

no grief, no babies, tho.  we can't all be fin de siecle poetesses.

THis is from Paul Hoover:

A quick note about the experimental in Chicago.
No, it's not slam poetry.
After I took a leave of absence from the college after 28 years of
fostering  good student writing and founding Columbia Poetry Review for
the undergraduate students to edit (as well as obtaining national
distribution for it), a number of students started to meet with resistance
to their poetry in the workshops.  One graduate student was told he would
receive an "F" in the class and the instructor wrote "This is trash" on
one of his poems.  He would up with a "C" after negotiations but this put
him in academic low standing & he was threatened with the loss of his
English Composition class.  The strange thing is that instructor is
someone associated with outside poetics although not language poetry.  The
instructor (it's not Arielle) has a distaste for the abstract and for
"scatter" or mosaic organization.  I had given permission to such work.

I left the college for a two-year leave of absence to teach at SFSU
because they removed me from program leadership and used trumped-up
charges of uncollegiality in doing so.  It was an old-fashioned
knock-down, plain and simple.  This happened on the eve of our first
enrollment of students in a new MFA program that had taken me nearly 20
years to develop.

When I left the college, I withdrew New American Writing from college
association even though it meant a financial shortfall for the magazine.
The new faculty advisor of Columbia Poetry Review then announced to
student editors that a triumvirate of faculty would be editing CPR
instead.  They would become editorial assistants.  After an email campaign
by the students last spring in which Charles Bernstein, Chris Stroffolino,
Marjorie Perloff and others asked the college administration to keep the
magazine in student hands (and asserted its importance), the faculty
advisor announced at a CPR publication event that it would remain as
before.  But this victory was short-lived for the students.  In the fall,
one of the same student editors discovered that the faculty advisor was
meeting secretly with a single grad student (now installed ahead of the
undergrads) to edit the magazine themselves.  In my last semester at the
college, I had specifically instructed the faculty advisor to resist the
temptation to edit CPR himself--it was for the students to do, as a way of
becoming part of the real poetry world.

At the same time a new magazine called Court Green was founded using funds
that would have gone to New American Writing.  It is edited by the same
three faculty members who would have taken over CPR.

If you want more detail (for those in Chicago at least), read "The Culture
Club" section of today's Chicago Reader, a widely distributed free paper.

As for experimental writing in Chicago, it's on a high note.  There are
three outstanding reading series:  Danny's Tavern (founded by my former
student Greg Purcell, now in NYC), The Discrete Series founded by Jesse
Seldes and Kerri Sonnenberg, and John Tipton's series at the Chicago
Public Library.  Kerri Sonnenberg has a wonderful new magazine called
Conundrum (she was a former CPR editor, one of the best, and got her MFA
from Brown after graduating Columbia College Chicago).  Margy Sloan now
teaches at School of the Art Institute and University of Chicago, adding
luster to the scene, and Bin Ramke teaches in the fall semesters at School
of the Art Institute.  And of course the people associated with Chicago
Review and U of C such as Andrew Zawacki, Eirik Steinhoff, Eric Elshstain,
Peter O'Leary and for many productive years, Devin Johnston.  Christine
Hume was there for a time as well.  Presently, on my recommendation,
Clayton Eshleman is teaching at Columbia College Chicago as spring
visiting poet, and the students love him.  Not to mention the new press,
Flood Editions, edited by Devin and Michael O'Leary, and LUNG, edited by
Peter O'Leary.

Sincerely, Paul Hoover

Maybe everybody else already knew this on this board but John Kerry likes
Romantic poetry and also writes his own poetry.  He likes to mimic Kipling.

http://www.johnkerry.com/pressroom/clips/news_2002_0827.html

You have to scroll about half-way down the article to the paragraph beginning
And then comes the after.

That means, after his Vietnam war episode.

I probably screwed up the link, but I just used John Kerry and Romantic poetry
on Google (there's something about the way he tries to comb his hair back up
that made me intuit that there was a link) I haven't heard of any of the others
actually enjoying poetry.  Has anybody got a John Kerry poem to cite?

Daniel Zimmerman, I was wondering if you think that John Locke's ideas hold any
water for you.  I was teaching the Locke section in the Intro to Philosophy
class and came again across his natural rights bit.  This is in a textbook
called Looking at
Philosophy by Donald Palmer.

"Locke's 'state of nature' is a moral state -- the state nto which we are all
born as humans, where we are all bestowed with certain God-given natural rights,
the right to 'life, health, liberty, and possessions.'  Recall that for Hobbes,
there was only one natural right, the right to try to preserve one's life.  ...
Locke's theory contains several natural rights, all of which are moral rather
than instinctual, and they derive their authority from God.  ...

According to Locke, individual political states are to be evaluated in terms of
how well they protect the natural rights of the individuals living in those
states.  A good state is one that guarantees and maximizes those rights; a bad
state is one that does not guarantee them; and an evil state is one that itself
assaults the natural rights.

It is clear that the Founding Fathers used Locke's theory to justify the
American Revolution, and they incorporated his ideas into our Declaration of
Independence and Constitution" (189-191).

Locke does propose some limitations, but those are the basic natural rights.
Then, how they are played out ni Bush's administration is that we do have at
least the Hobbesian right to defend ourselves, but I think he is also assuming
that governments that actively assault the rights of their citizens (the
so-called Axis of Evil) do not have the right to be considered as legitimate
governments.

I suppose most Americans are still in agreement with this, although they are too
busy reading Foucault and Edward Said to read Locke.

I'm curious to know whether anybody would argue against the rights that Locke
sets up -- life, health, liberty and possessions.  Possessions would probably be
the easiest target.  But the second one could actually be used to justify a
universal health insurance coverage policy.

Also, I'm sorry about introducing Agent 99 into yesterday's post.  It's just
that I see spies and intelligence gathering as necessary to the protection of
those four rights.  And now that we seem to be in a world war again (everything
from Catholic E. Timor to Christians in the southern Sudan, to Judeo-Christian
America is under attack), we will need spies if we even intend to protect the
basic Hobbesian right of to preserve our own life.

Talk Series: Serena Jost & Dan Machlin, =B3Me, We=B2

Most artists crave an audience, but what about the continuing allure of
collaborating with other artists and creating multi-author works? In the ag=
e
of such phenomena as blogging, collaboration has been a continuing and
significant force in the history of poetry, music, and other artistic
genres.  Singer-songwriter Serena Jost and poet Dan Machlin have
collaborated on a full-length CD, Above Islands (Immanent Audio), and
several other text/sound projects. Tonight they will perform selections fro=
m
past and current collaborations, and discuss their process and influences.
Serena Jost leads her own band and performs regularly at such venues as The
Living Room, The Knitting Factory, and Galapagos. She is currently working
on a full-length CD, to be released later this year. Dan Machlin is the
author of This Side Facing You, In Rem, and a recent broadside from The
Center for Book Arts. He is the founder and editor of Futurepoem Books.

I found your Valentine's Day post pretty dull, Steven, and I'm no blogger.
It's nice that you're a happy parent. But that poem was poor. "Without
doubt," you write, "all baby-associated words, concepts and images have
been thoroughly cliched and co-opted at this point." So what's with "the
tenderness of/this baby's skin,/the delicate branching/vessels..." and the
making me barf?

It's not only baby *imagery* that's boring: the parent's expressions of
*pride and wonder* at the miracle of their baby get pretty old too. And not
just because those emotions have been "co-opted" by mass culture: I think
they were always already boring. The only interesting birth is the
monstrous birth. Or if it was in a taxi or something. Or if you're Diane Di
Prima. Otherwise, you're stuck in Hallmark-land. How appropriate for
Valentine's Day!

Harsh words! But I congratulate you on having a son, and my wish is for him
to stay healthy always LRSN

Either this is saracasm disguised as ignorance or you don't have a
clue.  Regardless any parent who has chosen hands on birthing
techniques such as home birth would begin by describing it as
transformational & nothing less.  mIEKAL

Dear Guys,

This exchange is interesting to me because although you may consider
"baby imagery" and "parents' expressions of joy and wonder" to be
"pretty old" and "boring," in fact, the subject of childbirth is very
new in English poetry, being with very few exceptions a 20th century
(principally mid to late 20th century) thing.

Although the elegy has been an established category in poetry in English
for many centuries, the same is not true about poems relating to secular
birth.  That's a very new (popular) subject and hence, to me at least,
the imagery it appropriates or invents is of great interest.  Not only
is childbirth
a relatively new subject in secular poetry in English, but also critical
responses to this so far unnamed type (I call short lyric poems about
childbirth "magnificats," in partial deference to the role of Christian
iconography in helping its articulation; I call book-length, or
substantial poems about birth "broken epics.")have only developed in the
late 20th century.

Interestingly, "monstrous birth" pre-dates human birth in poetry (and
fiction), and is this, from a literary historian's view anyway, less
interesting.

Mairead

I found your Valentine's Day post pretty dull, Steven, and I'm no
blogger.
It's nice that you're a happy parent. But that poem was poor. "Without
doubt," you write, "all baby-associated words, concepts and images have
been thoroughly cliched and co-opted at this point." So what's with "the
tenderness of/this baby's skin,/the delicate branching/vessels..." and
the
making me barf?

It's not only baby *imagery* that's boring: the parent's expressions of
*pride and wonder* at the miracle of their baby get pretty old too. And
not
just because those emotions have been "co-opted" by mass culture: I
think
they were always already boring. The only interesting birth is the
monstrous birth. Or if it was in a taxi or something. Or if you're Diane
Di
Prima. Otherwise, you're stuck in Hallmark-land. How appropriate for
Valentine's Day!

Harsh words! But I congratulate you on having a son, and my wish is for
him
to stay healthy always LRSN

Ouch, David L!  And ha ha, very funny, to David K.  But I probably
deserved it, since I wouldn't let that sleeping dog lie.  I posted that
poem because I knew a lot of people on the list would immediately
hate it.  I write lots of fractured, avant-garde,
challenging, ground-breaking stuff that everyone would *love*, I swear.  But
as for the query, I'd still like to hear some of the poets/poems that people would
vote for as examples of avant-garde/innovative poetry that handles deep
feeling, especially *common* feelings , well.  I don't think that's really
a boring question, since what was I was really trying to do was draw out
some examples that would give me things to read.  I think there's a place
for poetry that is trying to find new names for new things and feelings,
but I'm also curious about how we might handle the problem of
common experience and cliche.  A lot of people experience a pretty un-avant-garde
feeling of "wonder" when they have a baby, even tho it's a
cliche, and that's the kind of thing I was/am interested in with the
query.  And while we're on the subject of cliche, a statement like
"the only interesting birth is a monstrous birth" is pretty darn tired in
its own way!  Anyway, now that I think of it, the birth was a c-section,
and there was a nasty bit of clear tubing through which blood and
yucky stuff was sucked across the room to some kind of vacuum pump, and
I'm pretty sure i can get that into a poem, along with some other dramatic
details that went along with the event...

Now that I have a blogspot, will someone blog for me?  I'd like to know
what I have to say!

Steve

Dear Guys & Girls:

In 1978 I published my "Now Everyone Knows Childcare" - an intentionally
ironic title by a father (moi) who was deeply invested in doing his 50/50
co-parent share. Though it was a big chunk of my life at the time (heah,
they, those babies, never go totally away either nor do we), I recollect
quite clearly the taboo nature of the subject (dressed at it was in a
mother's Hallmark clothing, as Larsen alludes), and hardly a career builder=
,
and worthy maybe of sympathy (at worst) from some.

It's curious how certain frames that do not fit within the literary canon
(and test the family paradigm) do get harshly ignored. I often wondered
(then) what shape The Wasteland might have taken if Eliot had been close to
children (instead of a bank's marble, authoritarian surfaces and
manipulations). Or if kids wandered on to the set of Waiting for Godot.  I
have always enjoyed Creeley's occasional takes on his kids, and the stories
of Spicer with children. Benandette Mayer is queen of the lot (Midwinters
Day -title) and you do get a strong sense of Lewis Warsh being on site.

Raising kids I found is a often a bi-polar mix but the either sentimental
parade of boring stuff, or the subject's banishment all together, remains
often a truism. Frankly, I think I read poetry more intensely when I got
delicious time free of the kids - without contraries there's no good
reading.=20

And, as things go, if one does not pay attention, they (the young) will end
up biting you (big time) in the butt.

Stephen V

I still have a few copies of "Now Everyone Knows Childcare" - a chapbook -
If interested email me.

I so enjoyed this.  I have unfortunately for me only read Foreman's stuff,
and heard secondhand about his productions, never having been in the right
continent to actually see his work.

Really found this comment interesting -

I can't stand art where most  of the time is spent simply building toward
the payoff; no, every moment  has to be payoff. The smallest possible unit
as Robert Musil said, each cell . . . I remember Simone Weil talking about
that too, each cell has to contain it all, each building block a totality.
The classic theater has always structured itself around preparation and
fulfillment, sexual foreplay and climax, but that is not the kind of theater
I'm interested in.

And also the comments about the ecstatic aspect of his theatre, which I
always suspected...!

dialogue on why or not to blog inspired the following archeological
research:

incertainplume.blogspot.com

blogged, february nineteen, two thousand and four (so far).


flippant as ever,

ela


P.S. And why not, why not a survey (=E0 la surr=E9aliste enqu=EAte, Why =
write?),
"Why Blog?"

Here, quite a serious reply :: each stencil is a different utensil, each
page a different paper. Writing a flier, writing on the fly, writing in
wired notebooks produce quite different results than writing with a pen =
on a
piece of papyrus. Each time, I scribble with a different decipherer in =
mind
(who might be the same, but whose mood alters), depending on what tool I
wield. And each tool yields new incisions and incisive remarks. Postings
differ in flavor with respect to their origin: sleepless poems written =
in
the dark, with black ink on previously covered page tend to be more =
serious
& emotional than scribblings typed with white ink on blank screen in =
midday.
Posterboards invite visual poetry to vanish shortly beneath palimpsestic
paint. Ruled paper is boring. Geometric squares often contained =
escheresque
motifs. Locked-up journals are sentimental and should be burnt. =
Sketchbook
diaries welcome collages (not to mention, kolazowki, or Polish racing
bikes). Tires leave imprints that in turn are filled-in with letters. =
Plumes
break and are picked by bird beaks as frottage matter. Scissors are the
instrument of insight into daily news. So, why blog?=20

First, the attraction of the word, blog blabber, gobbled gab, blahblah,
blagaboom, what can i say (say it ten times until you feel plums on your
tongue & you'll know what i mean)... Then, well, nonetheless, having a =
foot
in a foot-wide public space, at your own pace, & sometimes you forget =
it's
your own foot you got in the door, and you look up your own blog to see
what's new & feel puzzled why anything hasn't been posted. Hence, a
logged-in blogger is not quite himself (or herself, or not even =
hirsute).
Beats public storage.

On =E9crit afin de p/oublier.

Man schriebt wie Schreber.

It tickles to be read & books have no counters. (Although some, no =
doubt,
have been polished by counts of pomerania or on their own account).=20
Blogs invite immediate counter responses via squawkboxes and some such
devices. (By such devices more than a blogger turned to virtue. Read
articles on the conversion rate in Wall Street Journal, if you =
disbelieve).

Spisac sie na straty.

One writes to write oneself off, on tax-boxes.

Sometimes one writes a blog in order not to write a letter. And one =
doesn't
write a letter because one has lost the address or because any available
forms of address have been exhausted (common fate of all fairy tales).

One writes a blog to share, even with a reader etherized upon the table,
such simple things as, i have two legs and one of them itches; or, i =
broke
one, and now i have stitches; or, she has two legs and they're both
wonderful; or, i despise tool eggs.=20

One writes for lack of better addiction or in order to be rid of them;
addiction such as: gambling (heretofore unconducted studies proved that
watching the blog counter is equivalent to the nicotine patch), =
alcoholism
(what kind of drinks does the server stand on the counter), drugs (there =
are
no under-counter ones), and so on (let me refer you to the recent tissue
from Annals of Medicine).

But, I've strayed to applied to sciences.
So, why _do_ YOU _blog_?

I don't have enough time to blog.  Sometimes, though, I'd like to.

bp also wrote a novel about that painful experience. It's called _Still_.
If I'm not mistaken, it won Pulp Press's Three-Day Novel-Writing Contest
one year.

I like this. Miekal. It has the skittering sense and radiance of the just
born.  It also make me sad that somebody back when stole my Fulcrum copy of
Briggflats!

The 'natural beat' or is it (?) of natural birth. I so well remember
'catching' my daughter's head in my palm - the power of that push. I was
high, driven for days. She remains an incredible, lively force - now 23.
Astonishing.

And to think of all who are born who go way askew and never quite make it
back.

Life's a roll,

Stephen V

I'd love to read these but will have to search them out.  Does anyone know
for sure which book the poem is in or the title of the novel - there is what
seems to be a complete list for bpnichol's work here:
 http://www.ucalgary.ca/UofC/faculties/HUM/ENGL/canada/poet/b_nichol.htm but
I don't see _Still_ listed.

americanempire americanempire
yoyu have to imagine this really really loud
well it was when we set up but right now it's not so
loud
this should be almost deafening.
this should be about trhe american empire
we're playing and singing aboutt rock and rockk
you canj hyardly hear this something more
meditative
wellm, this is a mess already.
i was really prepared for this although i'm feeling sick

hyonestly this was going tob e the best thing i evert did
you would have remembered it and told you friends,
wow alan really soared tonight, it was incredible in fact i never
saw something so wonderul and instread he did this mess...;
he couldn't control antying,
look the girl even stopped singing and those other people
seem a bit lost, they're just running around.... so

what cann i do to salvage this, get rid of the rock maybe
music's an easy way out - this is the end of empire,
this is the end of empire movie, the last empire movie,
the music brings it home, it's all over -
i keep thinking that these words should MEAN something,
already I notice that something's lost in the translation

here is europe in 1915, just before the war, wait a minut,
it's coming upyou can see
everyone is just waiting for the war to begin
they're sure it's coming so they're going honestly to the beach
for the last time, they figure they'll go to the beach
after the war again,
and they honestly hope it will be a short war so they can go soon
to the beach where they will swim and froilic

this is the swimming and frolicing at the beach scene
in three dimensions, it's really the best way to see it
(it's almost as if youi could run around them and
see them from all sides!!!!)

that's the magic of the computer screen, honestly!

IT"S DIGITAL POETRY!!!!!!!!

wewll, ok.... i want things to happen
i want things to happen so fast that you will just
look and they will have already happened and you will
have been there - that was a bit of sumerian
in case you wondered, the dinger mes - moving towards the ultimate
giving of rhyme

i dreamed of the ocean of 1915, when my father was close to being born
or just was born, and this must have been what it was like
now we're entering another period, you know that better than i do,
when we have to fear the fascists in our own country
when that's all we've got left is fear and the hope that the elections
won't be mutilated by a coup d'etat this time just before
the elections, not even waiting until they're over,
i mean the people uselessly voting like in some other 'impoverished'
country of our dreams

theres a dancer i work with from time to time
he's swiss
which means he's from switzerland
which isn't the same as 'sweden' wlel you may ask
what does this have to do with anything

in his work he emphasizes the labor of the bodey,
which appears - well you cxan think of it this way
there are two bodies, there's the virtual body of dance
and there's the real body of the dancer and he works with the latter,
his peices dangerous and stopping and stopping

he tried to do this in new york city

what was I saying
oh yes, of the national archives in new york city
and they were lit by the fires which he tried to put out
by his furious dancing under the stars.

it was the tao
it was the other tao
there are two of them that almost do the same thing
like a rhyme or a upon that derails the nusery rhyme

i can't spell any more

honest, i'm feeling sick

do yoyu want to see two ballloons on a ceiling? i'm sure you do....

there they are - can you take FOUR minutes of two ballons?
one way to think of it is

look at ONE Balloon for TWO minutges
and the OTHER balloon for TWO minutes

or (my favorite!!!!!) forget ONE OF THE BALLOOOSN altogether!

well enough of that.
the point of this is that this kind of work MATTERS
and it carries its own meaning and POLITICS and we should get out
and vote and this time if we lose we should fucking take to the street.

thank you

Kari,
I've no issue with "Rights of Gays."  I totally support that all people, =
gay or straight should have equal rights and protection under the law.  =
My concern here is far simpler than the equality issue.  I'm of the =
opinion that of those "...1000 Federal"  blah blah blah freedoms that =
are granted under Federal law, I'm convinced that 900 of them should not =
be "guaranteed" to anyone, straights or gays. =20

Twelve weeks of leave from your job when you have an ill partner, or =
child, or whatever...bullshit!  Here's what you need to do:  you need to =
make the investment in an organization, start a business, meet a weekly =
payroll, have other families who are working for you in your business =
rely on your business's success for their weekly payroll, and see if you =
can afford to give one of your 20 employees twelve weeks off because =
their husband or wife (Gay or Straight) is ill or pregnant.  In the =
business I own, I don't make enough money to be able to give any =
employee 12 weeks off for any reason, I don't care if the employee is =
gay or straight!  In my small business, you work, you get paid.  You =
don't work, you don't get paid...worse, maybe somebody else doesn't get =
paid. =20

Life is not about guarantees.  Wouldn't it be nice if the mouse could be =
guaranteed that the cat would not catch and eat him?  Sorry, it just =
ain't gonna happen that way.  =20

This petition is the kind of horseshit that is fodder to Rush Limbaugh! =
You do far more damage to the effort of attempting to establish equal =
rights for Gays in this petition than you can possibly imagine. =20

Here's why Gays should be allowed to marry and have equal rights under =
the laws: Gays and straights are people!  It's that simple, and so is =
the issue of legal rights and benefits. =20

I will return to the site and follow the directions for supporting the =
concept that Gays be treated equally under the law with straights, but I =
want you to know that the message from this petition turns me off almost =
immediately because of it's misdirection. =20

If you or friends of yours put this message together, you missed your =
goal of convincing the non-convinced...in effect all you did was give =
those who already support the equality for gays mission a moment to =
restate their views.  You did nothing to convince the opponents.=20

Funny, but that to me seems to be the whole point of petitions...to =
convinces the undecided, the fence stragglers, the nay sayers.  On that =
point, this petition fails.=20

Any way, that's my opinion.

Kima akimbo as I sleep through layers of
acculturation, stoned again and shit-myself lazy; Kima
alone and walking through certain shadows of me, a
stain a cloud the minerals in our water that conduct:
have you ever starved yourself for clarity? If I stay
away from these women will I know what I want?

"Morning hair folded curtain-neatly along the daylight
of wrong potatoes."

"Asleepless with a warm-up, I would stumble even
across these messy endings out of love for you, to
kiss petal aluminium morning fades on my eyelids'
sulphur, so delicate and sore like ingrown nails.
Something in a machine that organizes violence on
language won't nap with me; it's attributable to
cascades of barometer. Renee blames me, moving on."

Renee blames both of us.

Smoke nails my eyes shut.

Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all
you see. On Valentine's day a drunk Kima needs to get
laid. She wrote to me. Vikings, vespas. A pink thunder
a cursory and impenetrable lighting. She mentions how
hard it is to know her.

The sense walking home last night on Cooper Foster
that I was trapped in a tunnel without flow chirping
like mad this morning, filling steel skies with crud.

I crawl in spaces between.

And at night the memories circle me like carrion
birds.

I'd sleep a whole mountain of you excavated next to
me, a pang at the core and blooming boo-boos, booms
and cranes, a whole crowded horizon frazzled with
impudent corpses. They don't remember my name there,
but I remember yours, Renee: trailing off like
elliptical traces of a cigarette in a closed room you
enter later, and later our history bloody from lying
between us so long it's drenched, changeable and
hereditary, wakes up into night's middle alone and
hungry for something to engulf and gorge on. That's
me, in the back in the black clothes, waving my red
flag.

"I know why she left."

Birthing my children is the theme of most of the most fractured/more
innovatively structured poems in my book CALENDARS. . . it's easier
for me to write about the strongest feelings in a nonlinear way--so
many intense flashes of feeling to situate yourself through, and they
are all tumbling over each other to inhabit the poem's perspective....

nichol's Still was a winner of the famous three day
novel writing contest. Here's its info:

STILL
By b.p. nichol

A haunting novel from one of Canada's most
distinguished avant-garde poets. A work of profound
emotional depth, subtlety, and intensity.

ISBN 0-88978-146-x; $4.95

I'm not sure if STILL remains in print. Anvil Press
was operating the contest for awhile, but it seems
they've called it quits. The last winning novel (I
believe) was Socket ( ISBN:1-895636-42-6 Novel),
written by my friend David Zimmerman. From ANVIL's
website:

"The 3-Day Novel Contest originated in 1977 with Pulp
Press (now Arsenal Pulp Press) of Vancouver, who
administered the contest for a full 15 years. By 1992
the editors, now somewhat older and somewhat weary of
the formidable task presented by the 3-day novel
contest were thinking of calling it quits. That's when
we here at Anvil—then a neophyte publisher—volunteered
to adopt the beast and foster it into adulthood. That
we did. It was a trying, challenging and rewarding
decade of give-and-take madness, not unlike all
dynamic relationships. It has for us, however—who are
also a little older and a little weary—come to an end.
Yet it seems entirely fitting that the contest should
find a new home in a vibrant upstart literary
publishing house like Blue Lake Books.

Commencing this labour day, the 3-Day Novel Contest
will now be administered in its entirety by Blue Lake
Books (www.bluelakebooks.com). Please click the link
to their website and become part of the growing legacy
of one of the world's most notorious and original
literary competitions.

We thank all of you who entered the contest over the
years, and helped make the 3-Day Novel Contest such an
exhilarating experience for all of us here at Anvil.
We hope you take time to peruse our other fine
literary titles, and revisit our site periodically to
see what's new. All the best to all of you!"

— The Editors

Thanks to Miekal, Maria, Stephen, Catherine, Kevin, Annie and Michael
(hope I didn't miss anyone) for posting or sending work, links or refs for
me to check out.  These look like intriguing leads...

Ela K. was so eloquent on the subject of blogging that I'm *almost*
tempted to start my own (I mean a *real* one).

And while we're on the subject of family feeling, here's a less "linear"
poem I wrote when my wife was pregnant:

Time Machine #1

she happen before out really,
back over in nature, sleep
time in dream turns down
wake, is future, is moment

time whole & faint, with
is somehow I, portal
for two & wishing it life,
that her up has I including it

we a something, me long
wake, machine dream
predicts evening, parents
dream body in the few

present wakes each have
later & up life, present stands
the then, tells in pregnant
nights here we birth


x,
steve

Well, this does sound like a mess. The students should be heard--they were
accepted into the program (presumably on the merits of their writing,
right?) and are paying for the opportunity to study there. Certainly any
teacher who would mark "this is trash" on a poem needs to take a serious
look at his or her fitness for the job. There are plenty of constructive
ways to critique work--even work one dislikes or finds seriously lacking. I
wonder why this instructor's name hasn't been revealed? If he or she stands
behind this teaching style, students and perspective students certainly have
a right to know so they may make informed decisions about whether or not
(preferably NOT) to enroll in those workshops and whether the program itself
is right for them.

I was a student of David Trinidad's at the New School and I found him to be
a wonderful, encouraging, and open-minded teacher. Arielle Greenberg is
gracious and warm. Clayton Eshelman is simply brilliant. It's really too bad
that bad feelings and politics are making it difficult for the students to
enjoy working with these terrific poets!

Alexander,

When I hear that you're organizing a drive to repeal heterosexual civil
marriage based on your opposition to these "guarantees," I'll take your
objections here more seriously=2E

yes, agreed.  the politics of creative writing departments are different
from English, let alone Philosophy or Sociology.  it's b---s--- to
generalize about creative writing to academia per se, and yet writers at
universities do it all the time.

for inst.  our highly regarded computer science & engineering dept. is run
on consensus.  so everybody has to get buy-in or recognize that they can
screw up the whole process.  i'd like to hear about any english dept. or
any creative writing dept. run on the same basis.  then we can talk about
"academic" politics.

bottom line:  a lot of the literary representations of academic politics
are literary politics in disguise.  this goes for folks with in the
literature/theory side.  they are certainly a version of it, but we exist
in one of the most not-obviously collaborative parts of the university,
and since the 18th century writers have liked to partial potshots are each
other.

robert, local considerations i'll grant... but to suggest that the

lies... too, it's the ruse many institutions will use to prevent real
reform from happening, b/c, yknow, "we're not like anyplace else"...

i refer anyone who wants to dig deeper into this to d. g. myers's
excellent ~the elephants teach~---there are problems with same, of
which i've written some (and of course a point of view is at stake in
any history)... but it would be to the benefit of those who talk
about creative writing in academe to read myers's history, for
starters (if you have already, my apologies)... in fact it would be a
good idea for most cw grad students to read through same... the book
had something of the same effect on me as when i left engineering to
do grad work in english, and spent time in the library reading about
the history of the engineering profession in order to learn all about
why i'd been educated (or trained) to think the way i thought (and to
some extent, still think)...

best,

Yes, Alexander, I suggest the most progressive move for you would be to
advocate the elimination of court ordered alimony payments.  I mean wouldn't
it be much more profitable if business owners could have no-cost divorces
(particularly after their wives have raised the children and become - so to
speak - useless). I am sure that without the painful obstacle of alimony
the current business climate - particularly for middle age business owners -
would improve immeasurably.

Getting real with the crows, as it were.

In the most recent issue of Poets & Writers there is an ad for the MFA program
in Poetry at Chicago's Columbia College.

They list all the faculty:

Poetry Faculty:

Arielle Greenberg
David Trinidad

Visiting Poets:

Nick Carbo
Clayton Eshleman
Karen Volkman

Past Visiting Poets:

Diane di Prima
Li-Young Lee
Laura Mullen
Tom Raworth

There are really only five poets at present who are listed as current
instructors.  Of those, Shanna says that three are ok.  That leaves Nick Carbo
or Karen Volkman, and both of them are just Visiting, so should be easy to get
rid of.  So it has to be either Arielle Greenberg or David Trinidad who are the
object of this criticism.  They are the only two permanent poetry faculty at
Columbia.  Only their two faces are pictured on the ad.  Arielle is smiling, and
her hair is blowing in the breeze, and she's wearing sunglasses.  Trinidad looks
quite angry and serious and may even be thinking of making standards so
difficult that nobody can survive them and everybody is thinking of committing
suicide.  This is a time-honored tradition for poets, so it's probably good that
the instructors are inculcating such bad feelings among the poets..

Bad feelings are good for poets!  Sounds like THE place to get an MFA.

I don't think there is any place to advance to, so I'm sort of a retro poet.  My first
poem ever was written at 17 or so when I saw that Eugenio Montale had won a Nobel
prize (I think it was a Nobel) with a very tight quatrain reproduced in my local
village newspaper that began

I have often met the malady of the living.

There was then an image of the gurgling of the choked brook, and also a dead horse.
The article explained that Montale had fought in the Italian Resistance and had seen
some things that had made him sad.

I remember I wanted to change the sad and brutalized feeling so that it was less
disturbing.  I wrote an even simpler quatrain that I think tops Steven's in terms of
what most will consider ickiness. It's interesting though -- when I showed it to
Ginsberg and Corso at Naropa they both loved it.  Even Ed Dorn liked it.  William
Burroughs said it was the best poem he had read among the students all summer.

I have often met the beauty of the living.
    It was in the magenta sunset.
    It was in the hummingbird.
It was a child reaching up to kiss his mother goodnight.

I've sent it to Hallmark cards.  But to my shock and eternal dismay they didn't want
it.  I wonder if anybody could top that poem in terms of simple love for family
values.

I think my poem outsmarms Steven's.  But it's hard to judge poetry.

Haha! What an ad that would be:

Come to Columbia for a Poetry MFA, where our team of inaccessible, terse and
vindictive academics and visiting faculty will help make the best
oppression-induced poetry of your generation. We also suggest that you stop
taking any psychiatric medications, and get an unfulfilling job working with
people who have no understanding of your future importance to American
letters, and generally denigrate you as a sissy. (Feelings of outsider
status help contribute to individuality and personal creativity.) Our
program will leave you with senses more deranged than Rimbaud could have
ever dreamt of, and make you a star poet crowned with laurel in your very
own living room.

I'm wondering if this is a general tendency, i.e., the more intense the

Yes, point well taken--
But, more specifically, to fail, or flunk (or "give" a "C") an undergraduate
(or even a graduate) student for no other reason than that you disagree with
their aesthetics---
which seems to be what is happening currently at Columbia College--
is, at the very least, not a very effective way of teaching creative
writing...

agreed, Chris.  that's a terrible way to a lit or theory or lit/theory
class, and sometimes they are.  we're all in it together.

I am just a little tired of all the information put out about how
universities are run and have the rueful suspicion that some of the lack
funding for higher ed has something to do with campus fiction and its
jaundiced view of administration.  And those who do it badly rarely
disclose their own baggage.  (I except fully David Lodge and Hazard Adams,
both of whom have a large perspective.)  Writers and for most part critics
and scholars do work alone in ways that are stunningly different from the
sciences and social sciences.  They don't, then, have much investment in
preserving the system.  Granted that writers (and critics and scholars)
are here to exaggerate, to sound the cry of something is wrong, but my
position has lead me to wonder if all the criticism has created the
crisis.  (You will be glad to know that I am thinking of Paul De Man on
some level, so my criticism goes both ways.)

Perhaps what I want that we all think about ways of creating new
positivities, new constructions and institutions.  But also keep the old
friends while making the new ones.  Nietzsche said we must revalue the
values.  He didn't say that we should simply toss out the old.  (I admit
to taking the Kaufman on this one, but who can resist such an elegant and
humane translator and indeed thinker.)

It's funny because for me it is often the opposite--the more intense
the feeling, the more alchemical pressure I feel structuring the poem
tightly, strongly--but where writing about birthing was concerned it
was the opposite--the pressure was to open.

That's certainly the case in labour, Annie, with the emphasis on "pressure".
Howl howl howl howl howl...

Personally I think the stronger the feeling behind the poem, the more I
focus on formal questions.  However, this has nothing to do with "open" or
"closed" poetics, partly because I've never been able to figure out the
difference between them.  (No, don't all rush in to tell me, I know that
"closure" is supposed to happen in more conservative poetic forms, it's just
that in some of them it doesn't...and vice versa).

I suspected it wasn't a simple thing and probably varies from person to
person?  How do you measure the intensity of a feeling?

Scientists typically employ the Emotograph, an instrument specially designed
for measuring intensity of emotional feeling. They then compute the data
using a multi-dimensional statistical technique to produce an accurate
reading along with accompanying charts.

I think bp reads part of this poem in the film
"bp pushing the boundaries" (1998, directed by BNash)
Coach House Press had this available for awhile as
part of a gift set of the Martyrology. It's a
wonderful film and worth picking up.

Poetry, like painting or sculpture is something you do because you have to-
not something to be turned into geometry, or worse yet English-- I say long
live the public intellectual, the artist as prophet, the poet who struggles
in the working world and is an artist at the same time.
Too many poets spend their time with academics and not enough spend time
with the richness those who work and struggle and a are 200% percent alive.

it is really simple Separate but Equal is always unequal was that not

hello folks;

i started housepress in 1997 as a means of publishing a collaboratively =
written manuscript by Neil Hennessy and I entitled William S. Burroughs: =
Ghost of Steel which was a mixed-genre (lyric poetry, photography, =
concrete poetry, printmaking) tribute to Burroughs and the effect his =
work had had on both Neil and I as readers and (new-) writers:
=20
William S. Burroughs: Ghost of Steel. (w/ Neil Hennessy) housepress: =
Calgary / Poetic Immolation Press: Brampton. (November 1997) 26 signed & =
numbered copies, 24 pages, 24 printed. linocut front covers on ontario =
flax art stock, 3 hole saddle-stitch sewn binding. 1st collaborative =
publication from housepress and Poetic Immolation Press. Note: 2 copies =
of this publication, as well as all archival material surrounding it =
(notes, draft copies, proof prints and the original linoblock used for =
the cover, etc.) have been deposited at Ohio State University=92s Rare =
Books and Manuscript Library under the request of John M. Bennett. =
William S. Burroughs: Ghost of Steel was also displayed as part of An =
American Avante Garde: First Wave. An Exhibit featuring the William S. =
Burroughs Collection and work by other avant garde artists (OSU May 15 =
through Aug 25, 2001).
=20
            (excerpted from house work: a bibliography of the first two =
hundred publications from housepress. (nov.1997 thru Dec. 2001))
=20
Of the 26 copies that Neil and I published we split the print run 50/50 =
and sold and gave away the remaining copies to anyone who was =
interested. A lot of that initial publication typifies how housepress =
has operated through-out its history, and what style of material it has =
been dedicated to: concrete and visual poetry, unusual / radical poetry, =
weird forms, some literary criticism.=20
=20
I find it interesting to note how i refer to housepress as something =
outside of me, something separate from my own physical self. housepress =
has never been more than me (with the occasional help of Courtney and =
other friends who helped at binding parties or by casting eyes over a =
proof copy). each of the decisions along the way from soliciting work =
through to the final publication I have tried to conceive either alone, =
or more commonly in collaboration with the author. This type of =
collaboration started with the initial publication and has continued on =
and off ever since. Certainly as I=92ve worked on pieces I=92ve tried to =
find a way of laying the book out to be complimentary to the content. =
Perhaps its this consistent collaboration which prompts me to refer to =
housepress as something outside of me. Or perhaps its my way of trying =
to hide in plain sight behind a non-identity, an attempt at =
self-effacement.=20

I also tried to work collaboratively with authors for distribution and =
community links. In lieu of payment all print runs were split (initially =
50/50, but later a smaller ratio but usually 20 copies) with the author, =
and the author was free to do whatever they liked with their copies =96 =
sell =91em, keep =91em or whatever. The important part to me was the =
idea of distributing work which I found challenging or unusual, a means =
of putting people in contact with folks who they might not otherwise =
know, and getting exposed to work which might be outside of their normal =
reading patterns. At least that was the idea. Too often it seems though =
that I am publishing work which is greeted by apathy and silence. Print =
runs of housepress titles are usually between 40 and 100 copies with =
modest cover prices; it was my hope that the prices were never high =
enough to be prohibitive to any reader, and if anyone showed an interest =
in seeing a piece but could not afford a copy =96 or preferred to trade =
=96 I rarely declined. But recently (about the last 2 years), when I =
announced online and through email that new titles were available I =
receive a pitiful number of orders (usually between 2 and 5 orders per =
chapbook) and even fewer inquiries or letters of interest =96 and in =
some cases even the authors themselves didn=92t acknowledge that their =
titles were published.=20

Additionally there no longer exists a network in Canada for the =
distribution and reviewing of small press titles =96 thus presses are =
too often regional in their distribution and there is a lack of critical =
reception and discussion of titles published by small (or =
micro-)presses. It was never about the money or sales with housepress =
=96 I was solely interested in getting the work out there in editions =
that were crafted with care and attention. It is this apathy which has =
convinced me that housepress no longer serves the function that I hoped =
for. I wanted it to be a way of distributing shorter non-book length =
work within the writing community =96 hopefully within the tradition of =
presses like bpNichol=92s grOnk, damian lopes=92 fingerprinting =
inkoperated and jwcurry=92s 1cent. All of those presses were early, and =
continuing, influences. There was and continues to be a lack of small =
presses in Calgary, although there is a strong community of little =
magazines =96 including dANDelion, filling Station, endnote and =
(orange). I guess the gift economy only goes so far. I=92d like to think =
that is not the case, but its hard to understand.

These frustrations have lead to believe that it is best that I close =
housepress (and its imprints and associated things: 5'9", endNote, =
garage and reuses hops) down. It=92s been a good run - 286 publications =
by 223 poets, authors and artists =96 but unfortunately its no longer =
fun, and this style of work is supposed to be fun. I continue to be =
passionate about the small press in Canada, but at this time I can no =
longer participate as a publisher. Sorry folks.

Additionally there no longer exists a network in Canada for the
distribution and reviewing of small press titles – thus presses are too
often regional in their distribution and there is a lack of critical
reception and discussion of titles published by small (or
micro-)presses. It was never about the money or sales with housepress –
I was solely interested in getting the work out there in editions that
were crafted with care and attention. It is this apathy which has
convinced me that housepress no longer serves the function that I hoped
for. I wanted it to be a way of distributing shorter non-book length
work within the writing community – hopefully within the tradition of
presses like bpNichol’s grOnk, damian lopes’ fingerprinting inkoperated
and jwcurry’s 1cent. All of those presses were early, and continuing,
influences. There was and continues to be a lack of small presses in
Calgary, although there is a strong community of little magazines –
including dANDelion, filling Station, endnote and (orange). I guess the
gift economy only goes so far. I’d like to think that is not the case,
but its hard to understand.

These frustrations have lead to believe that it is best that I close
housepress (and its imprints and associated things: 5'9", endNote,
garage and reuses hops) down. It’s been a good run - 286 publications by
223 poets, authors and artists – but unfortunately its no longer fun,
and this style of work is supposed to be fun. I continue to be
passionate about the small press in Canada, but at this time I can no
longer participate as a publisher. Sorry folks.

Thought immediately of Kevin Killian when I saw Kylie Minogue on Queer
Eye a few minutes ago.  The demos of the "cheap Asian cleaver" on that
radish and then the cucumber were really special.

hi derek and all,

as a small press editor and publisher since 1991, i lament the death of any
small press, especially us micropresses. i've kept a small folded up piece
of paper in every wallet i've owned since april of 1991, a little more than
three months before Boog began, with the following written on it:

"Ed Sanders to me at 24 @ 11:22 p.m. on April 26, 1991 'Don=B9t give up.
It=B9s easy to be idealistic in your 20s, it=B9s what you do 20 yrs from now
that counts.'"

I've always believed small press publishing is something that I'll do until
I die. I progressed from a 10-yr-old who clipped fotos from the sports page=
s
of newsday and wrote his own captions, to working at my high school paper,
working at one college paper, founding another, and staging a failed coup o=
f
the 500 print run campus literary journal to turn it into a 6,000 print run
lit newspaper (at the same cost), to writing for the college paper and zine=
s
while I was working on my master's and Ph.D., to starting Boog. It isn't
something I do, it's something I am.

I can understand the frustration, we all have it, but ultimately it's about
getting the word out on great work. I post here and email my lists about al=
l
publications. Sometimes the bites are many, some time they're few, but this
doesn't effect me, or should i say better, this doesn't stray me from my
mission of getting the word out. The feedback comes in many places, through
phone calls and emails, through hellos at readings and mentions in blogs,
through being bought a drink or a meal with thanks. Some Boog books have
print runs of 100 and are reprinted multiple times. Others have print runs
of 50 with 30 still in my Boog closet. I embrace the 20 copies out in the
world that people bought or were given, the power of those copies to
influence people, be it just as a good read or a motivating factor to
create. Ultimately we're doing this for the word, not, as kurt cobain put
it, to shift units.

But if you're not having fun doing it, for whatever reason(s), then you
should bag it. You've done a yeoman's job, though, and will be missed.

as ever,
david

Hey Folks,

Is there anyone planning to do some extimate poetry readings
in Chicago during the AWP conference this year?  I seem to
have been squeezed out of the official proceedings by double
and triple dippers.  (Really, isn't one panel per participant
enough?)

let me know (pmetres@jcu.edu).

i've heard this asked many times, and the real answer
always being: depends on the writer...

intense feeling either leads to a strong, fractured
poetry or limp stuff...yes, depending on the poet, and
her angle of entry...

of course, this is all slavishly dependent on a
certain idea of content...

klee: societies at war produce abstract art...

I was reading in the National Catholic Reporter (a liberal Catholic
Magazine) that Mel Gibson's father said that not only was the holocaust
'overblown' but that 'if the jews did not kill jesus who did?' does anyone
else get the feeling that the right wing Christians in this country and the
Taliban should get together? They could have their own country called
Medieval World, they could have all the fun of that time, Religious wars,
Plaque, and alike.
i dont see any difference between these people.

I know that most of the people on the Buffalo list are not traditional
believers of any stripe but I have to say that what has happened to
prophetic religion? Where are the post modern Dorothy Day's, Thomas
Merton's, Martin Luther King's, Martin Buber's, Joshua Heschel's ?  It seems
we are just filled with maniacs and crackpots who just want to destroy
things. It is almost like we learned nothing from the 1930's.

I find this issue fascinating because clearly Gay marriage is protected
under the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution, and any state court
that rules against it should be overturned on appeal. But even though this
is a civil matter, in the US religion bleeds into the law. And it's sad,
it's really sad, that the sector of the community that claims to be the most
open-hearted is, in practice, the most neurotic.

there is no open-hearted community in amerika... its grab what you can
and discard the rest...
amerika.. the plenty is for those privileged enough to afford it...

  if the constitution means anything..  there would not have to be extra
hate crime laws, or special ordinances and law to protect GBLT
population and other populations... the consitution.. up until last
year it was illegal to fuck who you wanted-.. even sex was regulated.
most recently the laws for gay sex with a youth was in acted to be more
serve then hetro sex with a youth - is one really worse?.. . now gender
is regulated-.. the court tell us what a man is and want a woman is..
the constitution needs to be rewritten...
amerika... .. needs to wake up it has been a two tiered system for its
entire history...


gay marriage is not protected under the laws.. when the flokz still
operate out of 18th century symbolism can not see beyond there own
television sets...  and now state after state are trying to pass anti
gay marriage laws as there is here California.. even no mr. president
want to add an amendment to the constitution that marriage is between a
man and a woman what ever that is.. the fool can not even speak let
alone define a man and a woman..

kari

ps
sorry.. to ramble.. but its time.. everyone no matter want just march
down to their town hall and married someone or something.. it could be
your mother, a chair, your lover.. what ever..

Lewis,

What about a third option--strong, unfractured poetry? Or is that an
oxymoron for you?

I find this entirely incomprehensible. It cannot, of course, be the
"same." But I do not see how it can even be similar.

anybody else notice that the commercials for the Passion of Gibson now airing on
TV judiciously omit any hint of the fact that the movie dialogue is in Aramaic,
Hebrew & Latin?  The subtitles willcome as a surprise to at least some in the
audience,no doubt --

Who killed Christ?

Well, obviously it was the Jews, wurrent it?

But as JaySee was himself a Jew, that would be a case of Jew-kills-Jew.

Then who hammered in them bloody nails?

Roman soldiers, but.

So in the most literal sense, the ones who killed Christ/Jesus/the
Son/Second-Person-of-the-Trinity (in the complicated arithmetic of how you
refer to Him before or after the Incarnation) weren't seemites (in Malmud's
lovely locution in The Jew-Bird) but frigging Europeans-to-Be.

So if there's any blood-guilt lingering around here, it belongs not to the
semitic peoples of the Middle East (who are currently busily engaged in
killing each other in a fratricidal war in Palestine) but to the Western
Europeans who then ruled the world.

And by extension to Western Europeans today, and their descendants who now
rule the world as the Romans did then.

And who they?

Guess.

So there's an uncomplicated logic that answers the question, "Who killed
Christ?" with the chorus: "George W. Bush!"

Come to think on it, that might explain Dubya's stumble-tongue -- he thinks
in Aramaic, and has problems translating his thots into English.  American.
Whatever.

Anyway, why is everyone so fussed about one-of-three who were nailed to a
cross in Palestine two thousand years ago?

In the wake of the Spartacist rebellion, they [the then Ronin] nailed (count
them) 30,000 slaves to crosses along three miles of both sides of the
Appenine way, and apparently the stench of rotting flesh lingered for about
three months.

There's a logic to empire, baby, and it literally stinks.

Catholics are under tremendous strain.  They have a church that has been
infiltrated by child molesters.  They don't believe in reproductive "rights."  No
abortion, no birth control, sex only after marriage.  They don't permit women
priests.  They don't permit divorce.  In many ways they are medieval. I think they
are beautiful.  They are absolutists in a world of relativists.  I love Mel Gibson
as a brother in Christ.  When I see the strain he is under I want to cry for him.
He clearly looks completely haunted by the terrible risks he has taken to witness
for his faith.  I'm looking forward to what I am hoping is a masterpiece.

Catholics have been smashed in this country for decades.  Upper-class secularists
have tried to destroy their neighborhoods in Detroit and Philly and Chicago and
Boston by forcing them to integrate out of fear for their political power.
Neighborhoods that used to function are now totally divided and dying out.
Catholicism is undemocratic.  They have to listen to their pope. And so there is
this tremendous fear among the rest of us.  They don't seem American.  But they
make up 35% of the population!  And they are hated -- Senator Joe McCarthy was a
Catholic.  And yes, it seems to me that they can get rather forceful about their
own viewpoint.

This is why Luther split.  But let's not demonize the Catholics.  It's easy to do.
But we have to be tolerant.  Even Luther did this, and actually thought of the pope
as the anti-Christ.

The tragedy and the opportunity of postmodernism are mixed together.  We cannot get
out of each other's face until the end of time.  So we must use humor and restraint
with each other.  We must!  There is no other option except armageddon.  I
personally am waiting for the rapture and have no idea what this will mean.
Meanwhile, I am hoping that our constitution will hold -- that the Bill of Rights
will hold together the different factions in a common purpose.  There have always
been fratricidal factions in this country, and that will never cease.  It's part of
what makes us a dynamic country.

Meanwhile. We have to take care of the earth -- and plant fruit trees that take
decades to bear fruit -- as poetry does -- within our common human culture.  We
have to enjoy each other's poetry, and try to see across divisions as much as we
can, into the best of Mel Gibson, into the best of Jewish people, into the best of
the Islamic tradition, into the best of gay culture, and not expect perfection from
one another.  We are all mixed together -- the wheat and the chaff, and to try to
purify one another -- as it seems to me that extreme Marxists and extreme
Calvinists are always too willing to do -- will kill the entire harvest.  That is
what Christ's parable meant.  It is not for us to try to hunt down every peccadillo
in the souls of others.  We were born mixed up, and if we try to be pure, we will
die, so we have to have humor and patience.

Let's plant fruit trees for each other's children and grandchildren to enjoy,
Murat.  Jesus was, after all, in addition to being the first Christian, a very nice
Jewish boy.  Right?

...but if one looks at it from within the constructs of 'Historic
Christianity',
the 'mission' of Christ was to die for the sins of all people.
So the perpetrators who carried out the act of crucifixion,
were only fulfilling 'God's will', right ?
And if you take Christ's words literally, he did say:
"Forgive them Father, for they know not what they do".

So basically who's to blame ?
No one,
and everyone.
It's a wash.

Mmm yes. I understand the seriousness involved in different ways here -
hopefully the satire of my post was taken as it was meant - to really convey
the opposite.

And I have some experience here - seeing a master's program crumble after
the key professor left the school - it's truly terrible, in ways that are
difficult to understand except through experience.

So I Tired of Trying to Love You


Crystalline the slices of green and silver
fallen on graphite mars and earthen dark
My hand with nails driven outward to tips
and rows of kettles on stoves unlit

Until I strike cardboard sulphurated match
three times to spark and then a skip
firelight in a brick mortar room and air
from windows mixes upward towards the fan

Hairs caught and pinched in wall's velcro
sand and grout on pulled silk shirt undone
lips I wet once dry they kiss for closed eyes
and buttons sparkle charcoal against the gold.

Lockyer rejects halt to nuptials
He dismisses governor's demand as a political ploy
Nanette Asimov and Ryan Kim, Chronicle Staff Writer

State Attorney General Bill Lockyer on Saturday rebuffed Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger's demand that he force an end to San Francisco's
same-sex marriages, calling the directive political rhetoric.

"The governor can direct the Highway Patrol. He can direct the next
'Terminator 4' movie if he chooses. But he can't direct the attorney
general in the way he's attempted to do," Lockyer said, adding that
Schwarzenegger's written directive "was a statement designed for
consumption at the Republican convention."

this is kind of marginal to your discussion, but if anyone's interested, =
i
have just finished typing up my notes from a conference by Georges
Didi-Huberman who spoke at Northwestern on "Images in spite of all" This =
a
topic of his recent book (Les Images apr=E8s tout. =C9dition de Minuit, =
2004) in
which he considers the only known photographs of Auschwitz that were =
taken
by the prisoners themselves. Besides being very moving, his argument =
aims at
the historicist/aesthetic tradition of speaking of the shoah in terms of =
the
unspeakable/unimaginable. GDH, quoting Blanchot, Bataille whose terms
(formless, le neutre, etc) have been misappropriated but who always =
spoke
rather of "the possible of Auschwitz", argues a way of thinking these
fragmentary, even inaccurate (from a purely documentary point of view)
images in phenomenological terms. (GDH's phenomenology is that of
Binswanger, rather than of Husserl, or of J-L Marion).

attachments don't work on listserv & i won't be pasting 7pp worth of =
text
into an email -- so, if anyone's interested, i will email the attachment
individually.
also, i think the notes will end up, sooner or later, at the
www.mauriceblanchot.net website. (The notes are in English).

parenthetically,

ela k.

I've thought for some time that this had the makings of a religious war. It
appears the Republicans intended to occupy the Middle East if Bush got
elected. Maybe they weren't doing it just for the oil. If that's the case,
it would lend credence to Islamic accusations against the US.

There are a few Christian mystics, a few of whom are in dialogue with
Buddhists. I think this is where one of the most fruitful grounds for a
religion of the 21st century is situated. Of course it began with Thomas
Merton, then Thomas Berry, Matthew Fox, and a few others. I highly recommend
the Spring/Summer issue of the "What is Enlightenment?" journal. Go to the
website and you'll see why: http://www.wie.org/default.asp

At best, Gibson's movie is an S&M costume drama. Braveheart with a loin
cloth. It shows how if someone has enough money he can project his pathology
onto thousands of screens and people will buy it.

I suppose I am being naive again about our seemingly atrocious president, but I
see many of the issues in the Islamic/Christian question as legitimate human
rights issues.  The near slavery of women among the Taliban, and the actual
slavery of 100,000 or more actual black African Christians in the southern
Sudan.  The following appeared in the Boston Globe.  For some reason there are
a hundred thousand African Christians who are being held as slaves by Muslims
in the Sudan, but since it is Muslims who are committing this atrocity,
progressives in the US can't look at it because it causes too much cognitive
dissonance.  Isn't everybody in the third world a saint?

These articles appear regularly in dozens of different journals -- they appear
in almost every Christian journal, but progressives in America don't pay
attention.  It is like the very liberal Episcopalian Bishop Spong who when
confronted by the Ugandan Bishop's refusal to accept the new gay bishop of New
Hampshire, said, "Maybe the other side bribed him with fried chicken."

I am on the wrong side of an issue, as always --

but check this out and see if you care -- I find it very disturbing that people
are worried about their rather minor domestic problems in the U.S., but for
whatever reason we cannot think of the following as a real problem, because it
doesn't match up with how we think.  Even Jesse Jackson refuses to see this as
a problem.

Please forward to all who might be interested:

If you're in or near Oakland on the 28th, please come by for new poems,
talk, and visual documents from David Buuck and Carol Mirakove. We'll
start at 6:30 with a potluck dinner, followed by readings at 7:30.
Information and directions follow:

Saturday, February 28th
134 Greenbank Avenue
Piedmont, CA 94611

DIRECTIONS FROM SAN FRANCISCO:
- Coming off the Bay Bridge, take I-580 East
- Exit at Harrison St./Oakland Ave.
- After approximately 3/4 mile, turn left at the light onto Grand Ave.
- Turn left onto Greenbank Ave. (it's the second of two lefts
immediately after you turn onto Grand)
- Look for a pinkish stucco place, a few houses up on the right

FROM OAKLAND:
- Come up Grand Ave. past the Grand Lake Theater, then follow the final
two steps above


Ride-sharing is advised, as the bus line from BART is unreliable on
weekends. In a pinch, I can probably pick you up at BART if you give me
enough advance notice.

Mars mission spawns its own unworldly lingo
ANDREW BRIDGES
Associated Press

PASADENA, Calif. -NASA's ongoing mission to Mars has spawned some
extraterrestrial jargon to accompany the out-of-this-world look at the
Red Planet that its twin rovers are providing.

The language can be so dense, clipped, technical and sometimes
downright goofy that only the most dedicated NASA follower could hope
to understand it. It can also be remarkably studied in its details.

Take the following example:

"MER-A ratted Adirondack yestersol while solar groovy, even though it
was high tau in Gusev."

Rendered in plain English, the sentence would read:

"Spirit, the first Mars exploration rover, used its rock abrasion tool
to grind into a rock nicknamed for an Eastern mountain range one Mars
day ago while receiving adequate power from its solar panels, even
though there was a large amount of dust suspended in the martian
atmosphere above its landing site, named after a 19th century Russian
astronomer."

So why use Mars-speak?

The answer's obvious to those who do.

"It's faster," said Ray Arvidson, the deputy principal investigator on
the $820 million mission.

NASA, perhaps like no other bureaucracy on Earth, does complex things
in complicated ways. That spills over into how it describes things.

"One of the things in the space program is people like to describe
things precisely and sometimes that takes four words. And if it's not
enough, they add 'system' at the end," said mission science team member
Rob Sullivan.

Paring down that verbosity generates acronyms and abbreviations. Both
abound in the halls of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the
Mars mission for NASA.

Spirit and its twin, Opportunity are known formally as Mars Exploration
Rover A and B, or MER-A ("mur-ay") and MER-B ("mur-bee.") The
miniature-thermal emissions spectrometer instrument on each robot is
called Mini-TES ("mini-tess.") "Pancam" is a panoramic camera.

The sometimes convoluted way of speaking is nothing new to NASA, said
Gentry Lee, chief engineer of the Mars program at JPL.

On the Viking mission to Mars in the 1970s, scientists and engineers
began speaking in "nested acronyms," where the individual letters of an
acronym often referred not to full words but to further acronyms, Lee
said.

"That is what happens on these projects," Lee said.

This time, as NASA explores Mars with two of the most complex planetary
robots ever built, the language is far more calculated.

"One of the things we found early on in the design of the mission was
that the team was going to need some sort of structured naming
convention to help them keep track of what they were doing and what
they were talking about," said Roxana Wales, a cultural psychologist on
contract to NASA's Ames Research Center.

Three years ago, Wales, along with fellow psychologist Valerie Shalin,
of Wright State University in Ohio, and JPL planetary geologist Deborah
Bass, set out to devise such a system.

"It's kind of evolved into a whole language of its own," Bass said.

The convention dictates that features on Mars are given names
suggestive of their appearance ("blanco" is a white rock) or of their
function ("big dig" is a trench site). Sometimes the two can be
combined in punning fashion ("mer lot" isn't just a patch of wine-dark
martian soil, it's also where the Mars exploration rover Opportunity
sat parked after landing.)

Specific targets within a feature are given derivative names when
possible. Scientists gave patches of "mer lot" names like "asphalt" and
"tarmac," Wales said.

"They're cute but they're also an easier way of remembering things than
with a string of numbers," Bass said.

More abstract notions, like time, also have their own names to help
scientists and engineers remember where they're working, 150 million
miles away.

"Yestersol" - martian for yesterday - is one example. On Mars, a day
lasts 39 minutes longer than it does on Earth and is called a "sol,"
Latin for "sun," to underscore the difference. "Have a good sol,"
"Tosol" and "morrowsol" all are in varying degrees of use.

Actions also boast specific names to eliminate confusion.

A "mini-Mini" is a brief observation made using the Mini-TES. A
"driveby" is driving past a specific target and photographing it; a
"scoot and shoot" is a series of "drivebys." To "scratch and sniff" is
to drill into a rock and then examine it with the rover's instruments.

"The idea is you have multiple activities going on and you need one
name for the whole thing," Shalin said.

For now, there's only a cheat sheet for the basic grammatical rules of
Mars-speak. But scattered efforts to record new vocabulary words as
they appear eventually may yield a full Mars lexicon.

"I suspect there will be a dictionary by the time we finish," Bass said.

Dr Evermore's Forevertron

Is an amazing sculpture park / armegeddon launchpad less than an hour
from Dreamtime Village, south of Baraboo WI (Home of the Barnum &
Bailey Circus Museum).  This is a quick set of photos I took last year.
  The space covers about 3 acres, literally 100s of smaller sculptures
as well as a couple monumental sculptures made from salvaged rocket
parts.  I know you all are googoo-eyed about the Mars rover shots, but
this is something closer to home, & equally extra-terrestial.

The article below gives some of the background history to this
extraordinary fantasy in metal.

I've been away for a while, catching up now with my various lists. Yup,
wrong side again, Kirby, or at least asleep for somewhat longer that Rip
Van Winkle. For a couple of decades the left has been the only voice
protesting the civil war in Sudan (if one can call it a civil war--Sudan's
ethnic inclusiveness is entirely a product of the British Colonial Office),
of which the enslavement of sub-Saharans is a part.  Altho to be fair
Arabians and Arabized Sudanese have been trading in slaves since before
Mohammed, without asking too many questions about the religions of their
victims.

Many of the presently enslaved would hardly be considered Christians by US
Christians, of course.

It's only with the discovery and exploitation of major petroleum resources
that the US govt became sufficiently concerned to intervene in the civil
war. Slavery and repeated man-made famines apparently weren't enough.

I've never heard anybody say that everyone in the third world is a saint,
or anything like it. Concern on the left (very broadly conceived) is that
our policies have tended to increase the misery of large numbers in the
third world while benefiting relatively few.

"Rather minor domestic problems in the US" have led to the deaths of
millions in the past and an uncounted number (because presumably our
present batch has run out of fingers) in the present, not to speak of the
degradatioin of large parts of the ecosystem to the point that it won't be
available to support future increased world population--in the future there
may be plenty of famine to go around.

I also note your opinion that Vietnam was worth the fight--old domino
theory stuff. Nations, like people, can't have multiple lives to try
various experiments, which is why "what if" scenarios are always suspect.
What if we had allowed free elections in Vietnam in 1952 as we had
promised? Nobody will ever know, except that we wouldn't have slaughtered 3
million Vietnamese in the service of our version of future threats, not to
mention destabilizing Cambodia, with a couple of million more deaths. The
lives of each of those folks don't seem to be part of the equation.

It would be nice if elected officials had to swear to the part of the
Hippocratic oath that says "First, do no harm."

There's an article in the current Archaeology about Mel Gibson's version of
the past, which points out how much of the traditional story is
fantasy--all those stops on the Via Dolorosa turn out to be suspect at a
minimum. And also the appearance of Jesus himself. The real Jesus,
presuming there was one, would have been about 5'3", 130 lbs, and with the
features, complexion, and eye color of a Yemeni Jew. And all those
Latin-speaking Romans would have in fact been speaking Greek, which was the
administrative language of that part of the empire as well as the lingua
franca of the eastern Mediterranean.

One last. In a recent post you attributed the decline in education spending
in New York to 9-11. I'd like to know how that accounts for the nationwide
decline in education spending, which by the way began well before 9-11. In
California there was an uptick in education spending under Gray Davis, but
it was a small blip in the descending graph line.

Many thanks to Kirby Olson, Terri Leigh Relf, Larry & Rina of Milk
Magazine--to Kirby for the original impetus, to all for enlightening discussion, and now
the nice surprise of milk magazine's communal page of ghazal contributions.
Wonderful chimings of music and idea.

"Secession"
by Amy Sara Carroll

Sometimes I simplify sadness, think of how you will leave me. I cannot=
 fathom
my heart=92s stillness, the heavy cage that will be my chest, tight-laced
breathing.

Opening a gift, we tear the paper=92s land-ho crispness. I train myself to
appreciate what disappears and what remains. If this were a fairy tale I=92d
begin,=20
Once I couldn=92t.... Now I can understand need beyond containment,

clutter-flutter, a genesis which begrudges prescience. This is the=
 beginning,
only a pinch--saucy saucers of eyes, an infant=92s dreams, all light and
darkness,

nothing as it seems, immersed in fluid, shoofly figures, voices and noises,
too
many fingers. Sensation plumbed, strata metered: touch, taste, smell, sound,
the sight. Nipple to mouth, the hungry I bleats and feeds, burps on a knee,

grows large as a continent seceding. Ni=F1a, Pinta, Santa Mar=EDa, the world=
 looms
smaller, you=92re leaving me, a dot on the eye receding, a belly-coast shore
sand-

settling into the self=92s silo, negotiating this and that, decision,=
 rejoinder,
catch
as catch can, salt-stashing away provision, little certain as our=
 magnanimous
past circumscription of the gulf. Now I feel my obligation to the ground,

gravity, it laces me down into the well of what I am, one gull=92s cry, one
wicked
hand, wishing for you, my metronome, my ocean-rhythm-whelkshell-home.=20


"Huntress Hunted"
by Becky Gould Gibson

The forest awash in coppery light,
white strokes of river,
a stag-man staggers backward,
swept beneath his hounds,
curve of their motion matched by
the curve of Diana's bow,
as the solitary goddess watches,
fresh from her interrupted bath,
tunic's gauze clinging to wet skin,
her brilliant neck exposed,
face half in light, half in shadow
like the waning moon.
A quiver strapped to her waist,
the strong-armed goddess
holds the bow as if she's released it,
yet it has no string.

So much for Titian's version
commissioned by Philip the Second
of Spain.  Imagine the scene:
an artist at the height of his powers
sets up his easel in the heart
of a forest -- Diana's sanctuary --
to paint the half-dressed virgin
who'd kill a man for less than
what he is doing.
His Diana is drained of her fury,
only a model posing with a bow,
her bodice draped open.
If such could happen to a goddess,
what hope for your sister,
her shrines mere palaces,
no place to breathe or hide,
her power unstrung. =20

In today's Chronicle  the "Terminator" sounds intent on fomenting anti-gay
violence:

"....Schwarzenegger said on NBC's "Meet the Press'' that he fears worsening
protests about the divisive issue and worries the situation could get out of
hand if courts don't quickly stop the marriages, which are being performed
in defiance of existing state law.

"All of a sudden, we see riots, we see protests, we see people clashing. The
next thing we know, there is injured or there is dead people. We don't want
it to get to that extent,'' the Republican said in his first appearance as
governor on a Sunday talk show... "

Visions of public burnings of gay marriage licenses, etc. as in the Gov's
homeland (no doubt, indeed, done in the name of "homeland security.")

Think it's time to call "the alien" now Presidential hope and express
another point of view.

>Sure, Bush is horrible, but I'm not sure anything really,
>really changes

Except for the lives of all the people, creatures and trees lost
because of the hard-won air, forest, water protections Bush is
gutting and rolling back and making a total mockery of; and the lives
of all the women who will not have safe abortions available when he
sneaks more of those anti-choice judges in during congressional
recesses; and the lives of the tens of thousands more here and in
Iraq who will die because of his war policies. . .

But what's a few lives here and there?  If you really think there's
no difference, why mess around? Why not just vote directly for Bush
and be proud of it?

Annie


PS  Nader should be running for congress.  And there are plenty of
local races where progressive third-party ideas can get real power
and have a lasting effect.  If Nader voters put their good energy
into those races they'd do some REAL good.

So You Say You Can't Write Poetry? with Marj Hahne
Six Wednesdays, March 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, and April 7, 7 - 9 p.m.; $150, $125 for members

As children we were natural poets, but by adulthood, we likely suppressed some of the sensibilities that enliven our reading and writing of poetry: (1) a fascination with wordplay and the infinite possibilities of language, (2) an alert sensory perception, (3) recognition and acceptance of our unique voice, and (4) patience with our learning process.

Designed for the beginning or tentative poet (although practiced poets will find it enriching, too!), this educational and fun workshop will present accessible poetic forms, sample poems, and prompts as structures that allow for the possibility of poetry as we uncover or recover our individual poetic voices. We will create a safe space for generating lots of original writing while attending to the particulars of craft: language choices, the poem's shape, and various poetic devices.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist from New York City. Her work has appeared in Painted Bride Quarterly, Mad Poets Reviews, La Petite Zine, Rogue Scholars, & New England Writer's Network. She also has a CD entitled, notspeak.

One of the biggest problems with the anti-choice movement which Bush
panders to is they've got control of the life-positive rhetoric, while
lack of population control, uncontrolled corporate slave labor, use of
the environment, etc. guarantees that life is truly cheap for 99% of the
world population.

The irony is that accepting responsibility for choices about how one
lives in the world is not, to me, that it is not "life positive" (I have
no problem being "death positive") but that it ensures that individual
lives have greater value.

For systemic change we need a new constitution, one that at the very least
(if the electoral college remained in place) has a runoff election in any
state that no candidate wins by a majority, and that also has a mechanism
for the periodic consolidation of states with small populations so that a
voter in the most populace state will no longer have only a 70th of the
power as a voter in the least populace in senatorial elections. Barring
these changes (especially the first), which are exdtremely unlikely no
matter who is elected to office, a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush. But
hey, it's your conscience. I would, tho, think about the roads being
chopped through our forests and the folks in limbo in Guantanamo (among a
host of other issues that do in fact divide the parties) before voting.

Annie and Mark,

and
"I would, tho, think about the roads being chopped=20

(among a host of other issues that do in fact divide the=20
parties) before voting."

I think you may be confusing me with someone who's never

(anti-nuclear movement), or=20
someone who's never been in an abortion clinic supporting=20

emphatically anti-Republican, emphatically anti-Creationism,=20
emphatically "NOT Right-wing."  I think you're confusing me with=20

I was looking for feedback, yeah "criticism," but not=20

look like an idiot or, worse, a Republican
sympathizer and you look like the saints of Liberalism.

Yeah, I'll likely vote for Kerry, but I despise the Democrat
Establishment Party deeply.  I won't say "violently so," as would
be the case with the you know whoms, but pretty damn deeply,
nevertheless.  And like it or not, I have respected Nader's

Please understand that I am and always will be

This is an interview with a Sudanese poet named Kola Boof, who claims that she had
an affair with Osama Bin Laden.  She lives in Los Angeles.  The NY Times recently
had an article that implies that she is making up a lot of things.  Beats me.  At
any rate, she doesn't seem to have the same viewpoint regarding her Sudanese
homeland as Mark Weiss.  Maybe therefore she's been asleep, while he's been awake,
reading the Guardian, and is on top of things.  At any rate, she likes to appear on
the back of her books nude to showcase African tribal goddess cults.

http://mirrormax.i8.com/index.html

She thinks Amiri Baraka is a fool, and so is Jesse Jackson, etc.  She supports
Israel over Arabic countries.  She's interesting.  I haven't read very much of her
poetry.  What I've read seemed a little thin.  There are other interviews with her
where she talks about Osama Bin Laden as a great poet who is like Hitler.  I like
the fact that she at least doesn't think in a straight boring line.  She also packs
a pistol, and may have given birth to Osama Bin Laden's son.  He wants to kill her,
because she has said bad things about him..

Has anybody been following the emergence of this poet?  If you go to the other
pages that are listed on the link, you get more pictures of her, and some of her
poems, as well as links to slave boys getting raped by Arabic men.  I suppose this
last bit is just another aspect of why William Burroughs spent so much time in that
part of the world.  I know that raping boys is part of their culture, and that we
shouldn't impose our standards on them, and that, as Mark says, this slavery game
goes way back and therefore is time-honored, but somehow I still find it a little
troubling, because I'm such a damned monoculturalist.

Anselm, yes this is so.  I've been at it for about four years.  I was calling it
Lutheran Surrealism, but I may be more influenced by Tzara (via Codrescu) than
Breton (I like Soupault better than Breton, and Soupault stuck with Tzara after
the fissure).

The great problem I find with surrealism, and with its great rival in American
poetics -- the WCW-Charles Olson-Objectivist localism -- is the lack of an
overriding myth.  Lutheran Christianity provides this abundantly, and even
permits the opportunity to think (which most Christian denominations don't).
Kant, Hegel, Leibniz, Kierkegaard.  What a pack.  All Lutherans.  Even Marx --
who ruined it -- raised as a Lutheran, and often citing Luther in Das Kapital!
Citing Luther very very often, in fact, and quite tellingly.

The problem with most American denominations is the lack of emphasis on thought,
and way too much emphasis on piety.

Also, Breton found his intellectual link in the German Lutherans, especially in
Hegel after he had dropped Marx due to his having been fouled by the Stalinists
and later he goes on to critique the Maoists.  but he can't bring himself to go
back to the Christian tradition in spite of his constant and obvious references
to it.  Even being called the Black Pope.  He was a sort of Lutheran -- against
the Pope, but somehow it never dawned on him that Luther was the answer to his
search for a project with massive potential.

My move is the obvious one -- to link the great surrealist tradition to the most
powerful intellectual tradition underlying the German Romantics.

The result: Lutheran Dada, or what I am calling Lutheran Surrealism.

For many years I dreamed of incorporating you into the movement in the same way
the LANGUAGE movement early on incorporated Creeley.  You were to be the star
figure, the blazing embodiment of what I was building.  But it's been so
difficult to get you out of the left, in spite of your abundant sense of humor,
your native Lutheranism, and your Finnish good sense.

I despair of ever getting more than one toe free.

So here we stand -- up to our necks in congregationalist piety mixed with the
disgusting allure of the Unitarians and all these latitudinarian (I love this
word, Robert) watered-down Anglicans turned into humanists.  Even Octavio Paz saw
it but could do nothing about it -- what was wrong with Mexico -- he said -- was
that there was too little influence from the intellectual side of German
Lutheranism.  But he couldn't bring himself to believe, either.  But the great
move is to unite WCW-Olson-Objectivism as well as Surrealism not with Marx -- but
with Luther, and through Luther to Augustine and baby Jesus.  I've yet to make a
single convert.  I am beginning to feel like Charles Fourier -- open every day
for business for thirty years, but no takers for his phalansteries.  Lutheran
surrealism will however once it takes become a massive movement that will lead us
to the New Jerusalem.

I don't think the report is secret. It's
nonclassified. If I recall correctly, the pentagon
leaked the report to Fortune writer David Stipp back
in Jan.:

http://www.fortune.com/fortune/print/0,15935,582584,00.html

It's been ignored and ridiculed by other news outlets.
Supposedly, the reason the pentagon leaked the report
to Fortune was to alert conservative readers (i.e.,
those with some power) of the problems we might be
facing in the next few years. Dig the following, from
a typically dismissive CNS report:

"Reading through the article, claimed to be based on
an "unclassified report completed late last year that
the Pentagon has agreed to share with Fortune" causes
one to laugh out loud. It is especially noteworthy
that among the credentials cited for one of the
report's authors is his work on the Steven Spielberg
film "Minority Report." The result is, indeed, science
fiction at its best."

Here's the whole piece:

well assuming you're on the left, you'd have to have rocks in your
head to vote for anyone but (assuming he prevails) kerry...

and i mean, i'm happy generally to see someone actually voting...

still, i'm disgusted at how the democractic leadership squeezed out
dean, who really did embody, i think, a less routine candidacy... i
don't think, whatever dean's flaws, that his failure was a matter
simply of self-destructive campaigning... these primaries are
designed to push certain candidates, certain kinds of candidates to
the fore...

and i'm just as disgusted with nader's decision to throw his hat in
the ring, despite the fact that i generally agree with his views on
the issues... either (1) nader just doesn't get politics, or (2) he
just doesn't care, or (3) he hasn't been eating enough spam... i see
it as a combination of (1) and (3), b/c i think nader cares, but it's
just that he's so doggedly misguided about the consequences of four
more years of bush (which was the exact same argument i used on my
nader friends four years ago)... and ysee, if nader were on a spam
diet, he'd probably think a little harder about his collapse of
distinctions between repubs and dems...

i'd like to think so anyway... i just hope to hell that those who are
pissed off at what happened to dean don't give the election away by
voting for nader... and i tend to think, sadly, that this is
precisely what nader's strategy will be...

You've spectacularly missed the point, for a change. I wasn't suggesting
that slavery is alright. I was I thought being pretty clear that it's not
motivated by the Christianity of its victims.

SURFACES by John Tipton is now available from Flood Editions.

Surfaces is Tipton's first full-length collection of poems. Here is a world of Cartesian precision, where matrices and Markov chains are revealed by the lattice of snowfall and the improbable order of ants. Yet the irrational and the absurd are not exiled from these poems, warping and defining their contours instead: "here the geography is the horizon here / Oklahoma moves him in ways he regrets..."

Margaret Sloan writes: "I've been wandering through Surfaces, marveling at the delicacy of its strictness, the obduracy of its lucidity. There is so much in so little, like micro-universes that proliferate in a single leaf, drawing the reader to look and look some more. Tipton has woven Euclid and Turing into a thoughtscape of minute linguistic, visual, and auditory particulars: the ants, folds, paper, 'writing at the pace of rain.' Throughout, there is heft and intelligence and even cunning in the style of Odysseus, but all so subtle and restrained that the reader has to, wants to, keep moving a little closer."

Kirby,

Luther's iconoclasm lasted much longer than Marx's, though Marx is still a
brilliant analytic tool against b.s.

You forgot to mention Brecht in your list -maybe a dada epic theatre. Let's
turn back to the discussion of Richard Foreman.

Rip Van Wilke(?) comment really got to you. No, you are not asleep.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

(codework and conflation)


I want to briefly mention another related approach, which I've touched on
- something I developed in the 70s - the notion of interlocking
'hierarchies' which are actually tangled - an 'immersive' and a
'definable.'

The 'definable' follows the laws of everyday life, including aristotelian
logic and its classical laws of distribution. This logic is the logic of
everyday life, the logic of concrete physical objects in the world -
books, cups, etc. Objects are discrete, more or less retain their form,
can be moved from location to location and back again. We depend on this
logic for our everyday activities - if we take a subway somewhere, we
depend on being able to take it back again.

In this logic, if A -> B, we might assume that B -> A. Move a book to a
shelf, remove it, put it back. The hierarchy emerges as follows.
(book to shelf) -> (book from shelf)
((book to shelf) -> (book from shelf)) -> ((book from shelf) ->
   (book to shelf))
and so forth. One starts constructing graphs with equivalent and
reversible states.

Now in the analysis above, I've typed the grouping from "In this logic"
... to "reversible states." This is the experiential level - and I'm
working on a secondary experiential level here. The _subject_ of the
experiential level is the book/shelf transform - say T(b/s). This is the
level of phenomenology which is temporally-bound.

Of course T(b/s) is temporally bound, but reversible. It's aligned and
allied to a non-temporal mathematics or mathematical logic. Once the world
enters into the equation, once time becomes an _intrinsic_ part of things,
the world is different, susceptible to organism among other things.

So say that T(b/s) is a reversible formalism, but that the world of
organism and experience encompasses and inheres to time. This analysis is
necessarily fuzzy (is the book really on the shelf? what if the shelf
falls? what does the book do if it's "half on/half off" etc.?) In fact,
Bohm's implicate order appears everywhere in the real world.

So for example given T(2,2) -> 4, on a formal level then T'(T(2,2) -> 4)
-> (4 -> T(2,2)) and so forth, but the _act of inscription_ inheres to
time, is subject to phenomenological analysis, and, in relation to
organism, implicates desire, apparatus, culture, community, economics, and
so forth. It is here that the 'dirtiness' of codework appears - the
relationship of consciousness to formal systems within a somewhat muddied
hierarchy involving mathematics, logics, the formalism of the classical
lifeworld, and so forth. Codework _as a whole_ presents its object and the
inscription of its object, both taken in the broadest sense; it can
present, for example, a range from the _political economy of the sign_ to
the presumption of abstracted, classical, pure, and 'perfect' symbologies,
sememes, and sign systems.

Codework takes into account that the bookshelf is old, dusty, perhaps
slippery - that the book might well be lost or forgotten there, might
decay there, etc.

Once this rough scheme is in place, it's easy to see that the
reversibility of definable models is counteracted by the implicit
irreversibility of the experiential. Within the experiential, 2 + 2 d
equals 4, but this is a _process_ (both Whitehead's analysis and
intuitionism come to mind here). One might argue that the process involves
issues of genidentity (see Reichenbach) and equivalence - but this gets us
fairly far afield.

In this regard codeworks take into account the act and process of reading
- another conflation, between the presumptive ideality of code and the
responsive organism.

It should be noted in this regard that somewhere, I believe, Heinz von
Foerster characterizes organism in terms of negation - an organism is
something that can _swerve_ or _avoid_ something in the environment - for
example, protists swimming away from a localized patch of polluted water.
An organism can actively _negate_ and discriminate among stimuli. Of
course, even a simple robot can do this, not to mention x- phobic or
-philic molecules.

The interesting thing about von Foerster's characterization is that
codework _in a sense_ underlies organism itself, since negation is an
uneasy logical operator that has been temporalized in the construction of
a world.

In other words, codework is a conflation of temporal processes and spatial
production; of material existence and theoretical idealities; all within
the aegis of consciousness. The political economy of codework is the
struggle for communication itself; its phenomenology is the relation of
consciousness to system and structure; and its form is wide-ranging among
genre and media. Perhaps its main characterization is the messiness of
cross-epistemological and cross-ontological praxis, both of which underlie
mind - human and otherwise - in the world.

All Buffalo Listers, The CPMPC has been updated, also many of you have
emailed me about reading during AWP. Most of the reading series in Chicago
are chock full but I have been forwarding your requests to animators of
series here. You may want to organize your own reading, Quimby's Bookstore
has space that can be rented for a nominal fee and may have space available.
You also might want to contact the Chicago Public Library its wonderful
Harold Washington Library has a Chicago Authors Room which is close to the
Palmer House and is rentable, but it might be rented already. If you do
organize something I will post the information and publicize to 'Poor
Chicago'.

David,

I don't remember the 1997 NBA finals--I do remember hating the Chicago Bull=
s
and hating Michael Jordan, but that's only because I grew up in Michgan and
had to be a Pistons fan.  But even my fandom didn't last until 1997.  In
1997 I was a junior in high school, I turned 17 that August right before th=
e
start of my senior year.  I was applying to colleges--actually, I only
applied to one.  And I was accepted.  And then I didn't go.  I had to call
the school a week before classes were to start and tell them I wouldn't be
going there.  I had gotten a letter with my housing assignment, I was going
to be living with four other people in a room that was only meant for four
people.  My brother had told me not to worry--someone always drops out.  An=
d
that was me.  The dropout.  It is one of those forking paths that I don't
waste my time thinking about--but what if I had gone?  What would my life b=
e
like?  There was a novel I read this summer--and I don't remember the
author's name write now--called "D'Alembert's Priniciple: A Novel in Three
Panels."  And one section involved "the cosmography of Mangus Ferguson," wh=
o
was supposed to be a philosopher of sorts.  He didn't know whether it had
been a dream or if he had visited another planet, but he saw himself
splitting and splitting into more and more people each time a decision had
to be made, so that one version of himself followed out each possible
outcome, and that version would eventually split too.  Essentially the whol=
e
planet he was on was occupied by copies of himself.  This knowledge only
came to him because another version of himself had written him a letter, an=
d
the version that was narrating the story, had been in the position to read
the letter.  Anyhow, I don't really care what my life would have been like
had a made a million other choices than the ones I have made.  I'm pretty
happy with where I am at now, pretty happy with the individual I have
become, and I know that I am who I am because of the experiences I have had=
.
  Anyhow, it is another beautiful day outside.  Of course, I'm on my way to
work right now: 1-9 today.  So by the time I get out it will be cold again
and the sun will be long gone.

Dear Gina,

A few days before Prozac led Abbie Hoffman to suicide in April 1989, he
spoke at Vanderbilt University. He talked about the battles that he waged i=
n
the 1960s against racism, poverty, and the vietnam war. He ended the speech=
,
"We were young, we were reckless, arrogant, silly, headstrong - and we were
right. I regret nothing." I went with Ian to the memorial they held at the
old Palladium night club on E.14th street--where NYU dorms now sit next to
the P.C. Richard appliance store. Inside the club they were handing out
programs, with pictures of =B960s and =B980s Abbie facing each other, and that
quotation on the reverse.

It's a simple sentiment, no regrets. I say I have no regrets, though I know
I do. But like you I know that all these choices, good and bad, have made m=
e
me, and though at times I'm indifferent to me, I never hate me and I like
the way I treat people, even if I don't treat myself so nicely all the time=
.

*

saw my friend alan semerdjian play music tonight at a hippie cafe near my
parents' house. i don't tell anyone i'm going to attend their events
anymore. I always say I'm going to do my best to be there, if i say anythin=
g
at all. i've been disappointed too often by people who tell me they're
coming to some of two thousand events, the best always being the day-of cal=
l
for directions and time it's really starting and then not showing up.
priceless. nowadays when people apologize to me for not making one of my
events i simply tell them, "don't worry about it. i throw so many events,
the only person who should be at all of them is me."

but this not telling people you're going to their events is also fun,
especially for the events that they wouldn't ever think you're going to.
like tonight at this hippie coffee house the cup in long island, i show up
and alan is all startle-excited to see me and he reaches out with his hand
and pulls me in for a hug. it's valentine's day and i'm alone but i'm not
really thinking about it, but here I am writing about it, so, okay, it was
on my mind. but i mean, i pay it no heed as i haven't been in love on this
day since 1995, so i'm used to it.

alan started the night with elvis costello's "alison," one of two songs I
played on permanent repeat for hours, for days right after first ex-gf did
the ex-ing of me. and the girl at the table next to mine asks if i know ala=
n
after he and i head nod toward each other. "I'm Amy" she says, puts out her
hand for me to shake and the rest of the night she and I and her friend Bet=
h
are talking, amy and i smiling at each other throughout the show. it's a
nice tonic on another night without love.

"what if I were Romeo in black jeans
what if I was Heathcliff, it's no myth
maybe she's just looking for
someone to dance with"

My only quibble is that he didn't ask us permission to publish our ghazals,
and I, for instance, don't think my ghazal is my best work, and I wouldn't
have submitted it for publication...  But I am glad to have another credit
for my resume...  Anyway, had I known it would be published, I would have
revised it.  Also, my ghazal is about applying for a job at the NSA
(Nationaal Security Agency, a spook place the government brely admits the
existence of, near washington), not NASA.

Read the Book, See the Movie
Corporation as Psychopath
By RUSSELL MOKHIBER
and ROBERT WEISSMAN

People ask -- Rob, Russell, the world is going to hell in a handbasket.
What can we do about it?

We say -- read one book, see one movie.

Unfortunately, the movie and the book are available now only in Canada.

But wait -- before you head north of the border -- they will be available
here in a month or so.

And believe us, it is worth the wait. (Full disclosure -- our work -- the
Top 100 Corporate Criminals of the 1990s -- is featured in the movie.)

The book is titled: The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit
and Power. It is by Joel Bakan (Free Press, 2004).

The movie is called: The Corporation. It is by Mark Achbar, Jennifer
Abbott, and Joel Bakan.

We've seen an advance copy of the movie.

We're read an advance copy of the book.

And here's our review:

Scrap the civics curricula in your schools, if they exist.

Cancel your cable TV subscriptions.

Call your friends, your enemies and your family.

Get your hands on a copy of this movie and a copy of this book.

Read the book. Discuss it. Dissect it. Rip it apart.

Watch the movie. Show it to your children. Show it to your right-wing
relatives. Show it to everyone. Organize a party around it. Then organize
another.

For years, we've been reporting on critics of corporate power -- Robert
Monks, Richard Grossman, Naomi Klein, Noam Chomsky, Sam Epstein, Charles
Kernaghan, Michael Moore, Jeremy Rifkin.

For years, we've reported on the defenders of the corporate status quo
like Milton Friedman, Peter Drucker and William Niskanen.

But Bakan, a professor of law at British Columbia Law School, and Achbar
and Abbott have pulled these leading lights together in a 145-minute
documentary that grabs the viewer by the throat and refuses to let go.

The movie is selling out major theaters across Canada. And if it detonates
here -- which in our view is still a long shot -- the U.S. after all is
not Canada -- it could have a profound impact on politics.

The filmmakers juxtapose well-shot interviews of defenders and critics
with the reality on the ground -- Charles Kernaghan in Central America
showing how, for example, big apparel manufacturers pay workers pennies
for products that sell for hundreds of dollars in the United States --
with defenders of the regime -- Milton Friedman looking frumpy as he says
with as straight a face as he can -- the only moral imperative for a
corporate executive is to make as much money for the corporate owners as
he or she can.

Others agree with Friedman. Management guru Peter Drucker tells Bakan: "If
you find an executive who wants to take on social responsibilities, fire
him. Fast." And William Niskanen, chair of the libertarian Cato Institute,
says that he would not invest in a company that pioneered in corporate
responsibility.

Of course, state corporation laws actually impose a legal duty on
corporate executives to make money for shareholders. Engage in social
responsibility -- pay more money to workers, stop legal pollution, lower
the price to customers -- and you'll likely be sued by your shareholders.
Robert Monks, the investment manager, puts it this way: "The corporation
is an externalizing machine, in the same way that a shark is a killing
machine (shark seeking young woman swimming on the screen). There isn't
any question of malevolence or of will. The enterprise has within it, and
the shark has within it, those characteristics that enable it to do that
for which it was designed."

Business insiders like Monks and Ray Anderson, CEO of Interface
Corporation, the world's largest commercial carpet manufacturer, lend
needed balance to a movie that otherwise would have been dominated by
outside critics like Chomsky, Moore, Grossman and Rifkin. Anderson calls
the corporation a "present day instrument of destruction" because of its
compulsion to "externalize any cost that an unwary or uncaring public will
allow it externalize."

"The notion that we can take and take and take and take, waste and waste,
without consequences, is driving the biosphere to destruction," Anderson
says, as pictures of biological and chemical wastes pouring into the
atmosphere roll across the screen.

Like Republican Kevin Phillips is doing as he criss-crosses the nation,
pummeling Bush from the right, Anderson and Monks are opening a new front
against corporate power from inside the belly of the beast. They are stars
of this movie and book.

The movie and the book drive home one fundamental point -- the corporation
is a psychopath.

Psychologist Dr. Robert Hare runs down a checklist of psychopathic traits
and there is a close match.

The corporation is irresponsible because in an attempt to satisfy the
corporate goal, everybody else is put at risk.

Corporations try to manipulate everything, including public opinion.

Corporations are grandiose, always insisting that "we're number one, we're
the best."

Corporations refuse to accept responsibility for their own actions and are
unable to feel remorse.

And the key to reversing the control of this psychopathic institution is
to understand the nature of the beast.

No better place to start than right here.

Read the book.

Watch the movie (www.thecorporation.tv).

Organize for resistance.

on Bush's President Bush bush announcment (s)he supports a
constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage


when push comes to shove, the opaqueness of the beast will dissipate
and through the transparency of plastic, you will see a mister bush
puppet playing president, trying to create a two tiered country one for
heterosexuals to fuck themselves and make babies and one for queers...
it is time to dethrone the king..

Congress Is Urged to Begin Process to Amend Constitution
By DAVID STOUT

Published: February 24, 2004

ASHINGTON, Feb. 24 =8B President Bush said today he supported a constitutiona=
l
amendment banning gay marriage, declaring that such a measure was the only
way to protect the status of marriage between man and woman, which he calle=
d
"the most fundamental institution of civilization."

In an announcement fraught with social, legal and political implications,
Mr. Bush urged Congress to act on the amendment quickly and send it on to
the state legislatures. Quick action is essential, he said, to bring clarit=
y
to the law and protect husband-and-wife marriages from a few "activist
judges."


"The voice of the people must be heard," Mr. Bush said in a brief White
House appearance.

++++

"I am a war President," I believe he calls himself. More than ever,
internationally & domestically, it appears to be all too true. From the rac=
e
card to the gay card, etc. Another "eminent threat," no doubt. Bomb these
couples before they take over America. Somehow I can't believe there's that
much collective homophobic hysteria that can be conjoined to his Party's
hysteria about losing the next election. Let's pray, so to speak, that this
campaign does not get wed to permitting a new wave of gay bashing by the
"sanctified." Or, one and all, be on guard against its permission. These ar=
e
desperate fools. And nasty.

I think the problem here is that Republicans are going to infiltrate the
Nader organization and pump money into it in order to spilt the Democratic
vote. The right-wing must hold onto its power in order to complete its
program. So we can expect every dirty trick and more to be used, including
making a dupe of Nader.

As a registered Green who voted for Nader in 2000...

Not "going" -- there have been Republicans pumping money into far-left
parties for years, just as there are Democrats who pump money into far-right
candidates. Furthermore, there are Republicans infiltrating and trying to
destabilize the Reforms and Libertarians, and Democrats trying to weaken the
Greens. Rest assured that all parties have staff experienced in this issue.
It's dirty trick heaven, but the Repubs don't have the corner on the market;
every party has some dirty trickers on staff.

Personally, I think Nader will be a non-issue in this election, and if there
is a Green candidate, it'll be David Cox, whom I'm guessing you've never
heard of, running at the last minute, and many Greens won't vote for him. If
you want to see a Democrat elected this year, I respectfully suggest you
stop whining about 2000 and start knocking on doors.

ACTION ALERT  --  People For the American Way
Alert Date: Feb. 24, 2004

SAVE OUR CONSTITUTION:
Bush Endorses Anti-Family Marriage Amendment - Next Action Steps
________________________________________________________________

TAKE ACTION:

President Bush today urged Congress to pass a constitutional
amendment that would require discrimination.

Organize an event for family and friends to swamp the first two
committees likely to evaluate an amendment with opposition
letters.

Get a complete letter-writing event toolkit and support at:

    http://www.pfaw.org/go/host_guide/

If you haven't yet signed the petition to Congress, do so now.
And, keep urging others to get involved by signing today.

Forward this link to friends as news of Bush's announcement
spreads:

    http://www.pfaw.org/go/save_our_constitution/
________________________________________________________________

Dear Activist,

Today, President Bush officially endorsed a federal
constitutional amendment that would require discrimination
against same-sex couples and their families. Bush's announcement
was nothing more or less than we expected - the proposal of a
divisive and radical scheme couched in misleading rhetoric about
compassion and respect. Thanks to you, we already have a head
start in our campaign to send Bush what he isn't expecting: a
resounding defeat of this so-called "Federal Marriage Amendment."

So far, we have gathered a core group of 20,000 people pledged
to save our Constitution from any amendment that would require
discrimination against any group of Americans. A powerful voice
for fairness and equality has entered this momentous, national
debate, and that voice belongs to you.

The diversity of our group is inspiring and will help lead us
to victory. Even some self-identified conservatives have been
moved to action, uniting with us against the polarizing tactics
that a number of their usual political allies are employing.

Now, let's make our voice bigger and louder. With Bush's
endorsement, congressional committees could move to begin
hearings on a constitutional amendment in a couple of weeks. In
that time, help expand our core group to 50,000 by asking two
friends or colleagues to sign the Save Our Constitution petition.

Forward this link to your friends:

    http://www.pfaw.org/go/save_our_constitution/

But, mobilizing others is just one part of the challenge. We
must also swamp members of the House and Senate Judiciary
Committees with mail opposing the anti-family marriage
amendment. To do this, we're giving you the tools and support
needed to organize your own letter-writing event.

Get started today:

    http://www.pfaw.org/go/host_guide/

The Judiciary Committees will likely be the first to evaluate
proposals to amend the Constitution, and we want the pressure on
them to be both large and visible. The Constitution belongs to
the people, so these Committee members should hear not only from
their own constituents but from Americans everywhere.

The idea is simple, and the impact is great. All you need are
tables, pens, paper, envelopes and postage stamps. You set the
date, the guest list and letter goal for your event. Count up
your completed letters at the end, drop them in the mail to
Washington, DC, and submit the tally to our equality mailbag. We
would welcome photographs of events, too. All the details are
available at:

    http://www.pfaw.org/go/host_guide/

Individually, we stood up and declared that we won't allow
discrimination back in the Constitution. Next, we need to work
as a team, reaching out to our friends to sign the petition and
write letters. Friend to friend, town to town, the grassroots
strength to save our Constitution is building one action at a
time.

Thank you for making this great start possible,
People For the American Way

P.S. - More than 4,000 letters have already been sent by People
For activists to newspapers and broadcasters across the country.
We're hearing fantastic feedback from them and believe the
effect is evident in the articles being written on this issue.

Subject:      another right wing conspiracy
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

It occurred to me a couple of decades ago that the hand-wringing on the
right about the collapse of American education was less than sincere,
otherwise the necessary funds would have been found a long time ago. My
guess is that the powers that are looked at the situation and thought: an
illiterate electorate--not bad!

Today at the bank I noticed that the Euro is trading at $1.60 per, which
means in terms of the old money that still clogs my head a dollar buys 3.5
francs. This effectively makes travel overseas off limits to most
Americans. Yet another way to suppress knowledge and the discontent that
comes with it. Because tho most Americans tend to tour rather than travel
occasionally a tourist does become a traveller and learn something about
the people whose artifacts they came to see, sometimes even about things
like their medical systems.

So maybe the enormous deficit and the attendant drop in the value of the
dollar isn't just folly.

A student of mine is doing research in response to Diane Ravitch's
assertion that the study of literature has gone down the tubes in high
schools and colleges.  This student is collecting high school literature
textbooks from the early sixties, mid eighties and 2000, and she has
discovered that literature textbooks have expanded, selections of some
previously canonical authors have been expanded (such as Emily Dickinson),
a few have been cut back (such as Longfellow), but that most of the
previously canonical authors have been fairly stable, and that the most
significant characteristic is expansion -- the addition of more
contemporary authors, and of course women and people of color.  She has
also found that no matter which period, the personal narrative of
self-fashioning (e.g., Ben Franklin's autobiography and Fredrick Douglass'
Narrative) remains an unshakeable core of American literature.  In any
case, she found that Ravitch complained about people not documenting their
research and then goes ahead and makes wild assertions without documenting
her research.  My student discovered a crass ideologue who was willing to
lie and distort and fan hysteria rather than to engage in a rational
exchange.

They say that college is not "the real world," but my student has
discovered otherwise.

My little tongue-in-cheek was really about elementary school education and
the rising rates of functional illiteracy. The question isn't who reads Ben
Franklin in college but who's capable of reading a newspaper or for that
matter watching the tv news and sussing out whatever bias. If education is
about anything it should be about teaching people how not to be victims of
those who consider themselves their betters.

The last time I taught, to be thoroughly serious, was 7 years ago, a senior
level poetry workshop at UCSD. Whatever those textbooks contain my very
bright students had for the most part not read. The brightest of the lot
came to me at the end of the year asking for a reading list--she wanted it
to contain all the books she should have read in college. Wow. So I asked
her, "what have you read of Plato?" None. That began a cascade of questions
as I fashioned her list, and a cascade of "none."

You teach in an elite university, and UCSD is said to be one as well.
What's going on, do you think, in the rest of the educational world?

By contrast, I found Australians in general amazingly well-informed and
well-read. Australians on the list will have a hard time crediting
this--they should take a turn at living in San Diego. It's good to remember
that Americans self-report as reading fewer books than any other
industrialized population.

I have taught at other schools and my wife currently teaches at San Jose
State -- plus we have a son at Boulder who is, I think, majoring in beer --
so I have a pretty good sense of how more prepared "elite" Stanford
students are than the average college student.  My wife, in two classes of
50 each on Introduction to Women's Studies, asked who knew what "misogyny"
means and no one did.  And that ain't counting Plato!

But everyone bemoans the lot of the young -- although it's old politicians
that gut the schools.  I generally tell students, even those at Stanford,
that they shouldn't get school mixed up with education.  Two different
species.  You hope for inter-breeding, but you basically need to cultivate
education on your own.

Murat, Who is Richard Foreman?  Sorry if I screwed up the Kola Boof
link.  I seem to do that a lot.  She definitely won't be joining the
ranks of Lutheran dada.  I sent the link to a lot of people to get
info.  So far the only comment on her -- this from a 67-year old
Gurdjieffian female living in a Florida condo -- "great tits."

Personally, I didn't look -- because of the Lutheran side of the
equation.  But if you look up Kola Boof using Google -- you can find
hundreds of links.  She's a monster hit poet who's been on lots of news
programs because she claims to have been raped by Osama Bin Laden, and
later became his mistress.  She explains all that in interviews, and
likes to appear nude on book covers because she thinks she has to be the
front woman for Nubian goddess cults of thousands of years back.

I had no idea what to make of her, or her poetry.  I was just completely
baffled.

Btw, I think Luther's best idea -- that money should not be allowed to
slip away from the locals toward a colonial power -- the way that the
Vatican was using Germany and giving nothing back -- is also Marx's best
idea.  That power should also remain local seems not to have been so
central to what has since become Marxism.  The centralized authority of
the party (supposed to wither away) is what makes it so dreadful.  This
is very very difficult to combat.   At this point only the wealthy can
even get elected.  Nader is worth 150 million.  Kerry about 450
million.  Bush -- probably a billion by now with all his secret links.

Lutheran dada would put an end to all this.

Murat, this is because Mark Weiss is always persecuting me.  I think of him
however as a huge convert possibility -- something like St. Paul on the road to
Damascus.  "Weiss, why do you persecute me, Weiss?"  And suddenly he will go to
bat for Lutheran dada.  The rest will be history.

All of the people on this board driving in their cars -- could suddenly have an
illumination -- instead of merely trying to crucify me.

Go forth and spread the gospel, whatever it is.

My wife teaches film studies at U.C. Santa Barbara-- after showing BIRTH OF A
NATION,she got a mid-term exam that explained how the movie had taken a stand
against "misogynization"

I've taught at a small private Liberal Arts college, a huge Research University,
at the same San Jose State where Hilton's wife now teaches,and at Howard
University, which is a curious mix of private & public -- I have not found much
difference in the level of preparation among the students at any of these
places -- though I have noted local small differences in attitudes towards
school work, student activities etc.

BOOKS I LIKE - some reviews of books I've been reading and using:

(Tech books first - very useful though. Others follow.)

Degunking Windows, Joli Ballew and Jeff Duntemann, Paraglyph Press, 2004 .
I use both WinXP and Linux for multimedia work; recently, I've also been
using an old Win98 machine which I put on the network here (DSL + WiFi). I
recently wrote for, and received, a review copy of Degunking Windows - and
can luckily recommend this completely. It's absolutely necessary for
anyone running XP. The user level is Novice to Intermediate, which means
it's just about for everyone who is unused to playing with the Windows
system.

Windows XP is somewhat of a mess; there are temporary files all over the
place, things that don't work particularly well, animations and other
"effects" that consume resources and slow the system up, duplicate and
other key problems in the registry (which contains information on just how
the system is supposed to run), and so forth. Since I'm using a laptop
which is all of two years old, and since I do almost all my sound/video
editing on it (as well as live performance), I need to have Windows
running as lean and fast as possible - I also need it _not_ to crash in
the middle of a production!

Degunking Windows is perfect in this regard, especially if you don't have,
for example, TweakUI and other tools already at your disposal. Even though
I'm in the advanced user category (I hope by now!), I found a number of
useful suggestions; by the time I was done, I had increased my freespace
(on a 30 gigabyte drive) from 10.2 to 15.8 gigabytes. This, coupled with
my recent use of GNU software tools in the terminal ("console") window,
has sped up my production work considerably, from video rendering to text
manipulation. I highly recommend this book to _anyone_ with WinXP,
especially if you're using your computer for more than email and surfing
(although there are good sections on both as well).

Linux in a Nutshell, A Desktop Quick Reference, 4th edition, Ellen Siever,
Stephen Figgins, and Aaron Weber, O'Reilly, 2003 . Well, this is now
enormous, over 900 pages long, which gives a good indication of the growth
of Linux. At one point, I would have recommended this to beginners - at
this point, it's better for intermediate or advanced users, I think, who
would need the full set of commands (and it's not even that!), with their
options. It covers the KDE and Gnome desktops; RCS and CVS for project
control; there are sections on bash and tcsh, on sed and gawk and vi and
its varieties and Emacs, etc. etc. It's still an amazingly quick lookup
when you need something in a hurry.

Speaking of which, I've now been using Fedora from RedHat, problem free,
for quite a while. I would switch fully to linux, but it's terrible for
multimedia video applications, relatively poor for sound as well. There's
no Quicktime for linux, except a version which runs Quicktime uncompressed
- which isn't all that useful. On the other hand, for text, programming (I
think, not being a programmer), 3D modeling with Blender, Gimp image
manipulation, etc. etc., there's nothing better and it's absolutely
stable. And the number of Net tools, of all sorts, available makes it
indispensable. I again want to mention the Zaurus PDA, which I take with
me everywhere, and do a fair amount of my work on - and it's linux-based;
you can download just about everything you need for it (for example, I
have Kismet, perl, dig, pico, wget, etc. etc.).

I also mentioned before the GNU disks for Windows, which allow a full set
of linux tools to be installed on anything from Win3.1 through XP; I think
some of them will even run on older DOS machines.

Wireless Hacks, 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools, Rob Flickenger
O'Reilly, 2003 . The whole Hacks series from O'Reilly is great and
relatively new. This one deals with hands-on hardware and software
suggestions, including ways to make antennas, how to add on antennas to
laptops, long line-of-sight connections, WiFi and Bluetooth information
including incredible software, etc. It's interesting that Wireless is
paralleling old-time ham radio - people are building all sorts of wireless
gadgets, having hotspot contests (there were and probably still are DXing
- distance reception - contests for ham radio operators), forming
temporary communities, etc. (Somewhere there's a Phd thesis here; both
media are characterized to some extent by make-shift or bricolage hacking
approaches.) I love this book - and in fact love the whole wireless
revolution - it's incredibly exciting to have the world at one's finger-
tips, one's mind extending through the palm into a huge cerebral database
of humanity which is still growing, probably exponentially. Azure is from
Huntington Beach; with the Zaurus PDA, just about anywhere in New York, we
can immediately view the coast about a mile from her parents' home,
weather, surfers and all.

Other books I use regularly are Amazon Hacks and Google Hacks, both of
which I've described before. I really recommend these as well.

Mastering Regular Expressions, 2nd edition, Jeffrey Friedl, O'Reilly, 2002
. Wow, this is a fairly long and detailed handbook for those of us who
otherwise might have an afternoon free. For those who don't know, a
regular expression is a _framework_ which filters or sorts in any number
of ways. For example [0-9] can represent any single digit number. As in
DOS, etc., * is a "wildcard." An example is (?<=\d)(?=(\d\d\d)+$) found on
p. 65. Expressions are used with commands such as tr, grep, sed, awk, and
just about any language - they're found all over perl. They provide
shortcuts for complex text manipulation. For example, if I wanted to
eliminate all blank lines in this file ("foo"), I might enter, at the
prompt, grep -v ^$ foo > bar, and that would do it.

This book gives you far more information than you might ever need - but
it's nice to know it's there.

The New Media Reader, eds. Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort, MIT,
2003 . Personally, I find this book incredibly useful. It was the subject
of a full month on the Empyre mailing list, during which the term "New
Media" (and others) was debated; a similar debate has now opened on
Nettime. The book has what might be considered primordial articles by
Billy Kluver, Ivan Sutherland, Raymond Williams, McLuhan, Joseph
Weizenbaum (yay! Eliza), among others. It goes roughly through 1994, with
the disk going through 1996; the idea is to develop the roots and possible
foundations of a discourse before the 'explosion' of online art. The
layout is excellent, as is the accompanying cdrom.

I do wish there were more on MOOs and MUDs etc. in it, but there are
selections from Brenda Laurel and Sherry Turkle. On the other hand, the
term "New Media" has become a grab-bag (as has "postmodernism" for
example) for just about every techno-cultural change, that it's hard to
know where any book should begin and end. My own interest is along the
lines of phenomenology and psychoanalysis, as well as early environments
(some of which are on the disk), and there's an enormous amount to keep me
interested.

In this regard, by the way, I want also to mention Jon Marshall's work on
the Cybermind email list - he's been writing on it and analyzing for
years, and I think this sort of thing - following an online community in
depth - is enormously valuable in understanding, not only "online" per se,
but the very nature of culture and consciousness.

AND:

Classical Chinese Literature, An Anthology of Translations, Volume I: From
Antiquity to the Tang Dynasty, eds. John Minford and Joseph S. M. Lau,
Columbia and Chinese University, 2000 . I'd seen this around, but never
could afford it until I found it at Mercer Street Books here in New York.
It's over 1100 pages of literary materials, some given in several trans-
lations and numerous European languages, including French, Latin, German,
etc. The result is an odd but extremely useful dialectic among cultures;
some of the translations are hundreds of years old.

The reason I tend towards these enormous anthologies, is that I'm a
sinophile, but not sinologist; I'm introduced to works I'd never see
otherwise. There's even a section of the Thousand Character Essay in here.
The comparative translations are incredibly useful, by the way, since I
have a feeling that things like the Book of Songs/Odes are generally
massacred.

Along these lines, I'm also reading the full version of Wu Cheng'en's
Journey to the West - part of which Waley translated as Monkey. I'm now on
page 1857 out of 2300 plus. There are four paperback volumes, translated
by W. J. F.  Jenner, put out by the Foreign Languages Press, Peking. I
cannot recommend this work enough - it's brilliant and incessant and one
really needs to go through the full 100 chapters, with their poems,
cosmological allusions, and so forth, to understand the work. It's been
quite useful as an aid to understanding a great many other works as well,
since there is much Taoist/Buddhist magic in it, not to mention lamaism,
Confucism, and so forth. (By the way, the Foreign Language Press now
prints a great number of translations of classic texts for very little
money - do check them out.)

Domesday Book, A Complete Translation, various, 1992, Penguin, 2002 . I'd
never read nor seen the Domesday book before this, and it's mainly an
account from 1086 of tax roles and demographics across Norman England. On
the other hand, if you have patience with this, you'll learn more about
the roots of Anglo-American culture, than from any other source I can
think of. It's amazing that this full accounting of a nation-in-the-making
has survived for close to a thousand years - and that it was even compiled
at all. For me, it relates well to much earlier Sumerian, Akkadian,
Babylonian, etc. temple and landholding records. It's fascinating to pick
up (well it's over 1400 pages of small print) and read at will.

Hegemony or Survival, America's Quest for Global Dominance, Noam Chomsky,
Metropolitan, 2003 . I'm slowly moving through this, trying not to commit
suicide. The book is simultaneously a warning and an account of what went
wrong and continues to go wrong. Anything on American Empire is worth
reading as is Hannah Arendt on imperialism for that matter. Chomsky's
account of nuclear strategy is the most frightening thing of all.

The problem is - what to do with the book? The account is enormous and
furious and there's nowhere to go but do check out
http://www.americanempireproject.com .

I Ching, James Legge translation reorganized by Raymond Vanover, Mentor,
1971 . I'm not so much interested in the predictive nature of the work, as
I am in the appendices which reflect Chinese cosmogony. Legge does his
best translation work with Confucian texts, but at least he's not turning
the I Ching into a Jungian treatise, for which I'm grateful. This is an
older Mentor paperback and I highly recommend it if you can find it. I
appreciate the technical nature of the notes as well.

Kievan Russia, George Vernadsky, Yale, 1948, paperback, 1976 . I realize
this is old, but since I'm a fan of The Russian Primary Chronicle
(translated by Samuel Cross in two quite old editions as well), this is
great as background reading. Obviously, most North Americans know little
about Russian history (not to mention philosophy - and there are a number
of anthologies available here), and this helps a great deal. I have no
idea how the field has progressed, but the book is eminently readable and
detailed.

Biogeochemistry, An Analysis of Global Change, second edition, William H.
Schlesinger, Academic Press, 1997-97 . All I can say is get this book if
you're interested in issues of global warming, pollution, planetary cycles
of elements, and so forth. It's one of the most detailed accounts I've
read, and gives clear examples of the complexity of the world ecosystem
and its biomes. Be warned this is a technical book, and requires close
attention to the text.

Finally, The Mary Shelley Reader, eds. Betty T. Bennett & Charles E.
Robinson, Oxford, 1990. I'm a fan, this is a great collection, including
the original 1818 version of Frankenstein, letters, reviews, and so forth.
Buy it! Now I'm reading some of Keats' letters - I love these people!

Federal agency cuts gay data from site
Christopher Curtis, Gay.com / PlanetOut.com Network
Tuesday, February 24, 2004 / 02:53 PM

Federal workers wanting to complain about discrimination on the job
because of their sexual orientation won't be able to get the
information they need from the agency charged with protecting
government whistleblowers.

Scott J. Bloch, the Republican appointed head of the Office of Special
Council (OSC), removed references regarding sexual orientation
discrimination from the complaint form and educational pamphlet on the
agency's Web site.

Bloch told the Washington Post Friday that he is not sure if federal
workers are protected from discrimination claims based on their
sexuality. Pulling such references "is no way a statement that this
office is retreating from any employee rights, or enforcement of
employee rights," Bloch told the paper, adding a review was necessary.

Congressional representatives and senators criticized Bloch, saying he
had gone back on his word and overreached his authority.

In a Feb. 19 letter four senators from the Governmental Affairs
Committee, which oversees Bloch's office, wrote: "During the
confirmation process, you assured us that you were committed to
protecting federal employees against unlawful discrimination related to
their sexual orientation."

"We are concerned that the recent changes to OSC publications might
give federal employees the opposite impression, and we ask that you
reaffirm your previously stated commitment and advise us of steps you
will take to inform federal employees of their rights and remedies
under the law."

The letter was signed by Sens.Carl M. Levin, D-Mich., Daniel K. Akaka,
D-Hawaii, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman,
D-Conn.

On the same day, Reps. John Conyers, D-Mich., and Jerrold Nadler,
D-N.Y., members of the House Judiciary Committee, wrote: "From all
appearances, you seem to have taken it upon yourself to withdraw legal
protections for federal employees without any legal authority."

On Monday the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC)
complained to Bloch, saying, "What you have done defies all laws of
reason and furthers the view that this administration and its political
appointees are willing to sacrifice the rights and equality of one
segment of society to placate the radical and hateful beliefs of
another."

The NGLCC concluded its letter by requesting Bloch "immediately replace
the removed material, quit inciting fear among your gay and lesbian
employees that their jobs might be in jeopardy and move onto something
more worthwhile."

You're probably aware that I try never to be provocative, so you'll take
this in the best way: to this old Jewish atheist the idea that there is a
god and that god had a son would be hysterically funny (ultimate dada, in
fact) if it hadn't been so bad for, among many many others, my people.

Hopefully there won't be too many illuminations while driving--could cause
terrible accidents. Even worse than cell phones.

Gov. Schwarzenegger's remarks the other day on the potential of gay
marriage to provoke violence seem quite in concert here. At first they read
as merely garbled: "All of a sudden, we see riots, we see protests, we see
people clashing. The next thing we know, there is injured or there is dead
people." But take away the quaint ESL interference and what is he really
saying? It rather unfurls into a threat if you think about it, or at least
a violent wish. Either way it's fucking bullshit. Sorry I can't supply more
context, I read it on a blog LRSN

you're right, Millie. I didn't ask permission to publish the ghazals and =
for that I apologize. In a moment of brazen editorialship I posted them =

paul krugman's theory is that the deficit is entirely intentional,
motivated by the desire to dismantle any New Deal benefits like
social security, welfare, etc., in the name of "we can't afford it."

Kirby I doubt this will ever happen so long as you do
things like try to ascertain Annie Finch's sexuality
and/or religious background based on her hair length
and style or post such sentences as:

"...as well as links to slave boys getting raped by
Arabic men.  I suppose this last bit is just another
aspect of why William Burroughs spent so much time in
that part of the world.  I know that raping boys is
part of their culture, and that we..."

No one is trying to crucify you Kirby; speaking for
myself I just try to avoid violence and insensitivity
that seems very incidental and matter-of-factly
stateed in some of your posts.

Kirby, exactly what is your point when you make
statements like that?

This has become the norm in Canada in the last ten years or so in
provincial politics.

A Tory government gets in, does an independent audit and says that the
cupboards are bare and then cuts all the social programs that we Canajuns
pride ourselves on. Usually a tax break for the upper middle class lurks
somewhere in the shadows too.

This template has been used in Alberta, BC, Ontario, Nova Scotia and now
in my province, Newfoundland & Labrador, the newly elected Tory government
hired the same auditor as Ontrio to (re)produce a report that show that we
can't afford things like a second MRI machine for the province.

I'm writing a piece on the phenomenon called "Domino Effect" for a
national poetry contest/slam thing.

kleptocracy
falling through the country
like a wave of sick

It should be noted that some of these governments hired American advisors
to help them with their campaigns. Advisors, I know.

Now if my comments widen the conspiracy to include the whole continent,
don't get me going on the FTAA.

ART PAPERS ANNOUNCES SEARCH FOR NEW EDITOR-IN-CHIEF

The Art Papers Board of Directors announced today that the organization has
begun searching for a successor to Editor-in-Chief Charles Reeve.  The
search is expected to last approximately five months, with the new editor
taking office this summer. To ensure a smooth transition, Dr. Reeve will
remain as editor until his successor is ready to assume the full range of
editorial responsibilities.

Now one of the world's top 5 art publications according to a 2002 study by
Columbia University, Art Papers also recently received the Utne Independent
Press Award for best arts/literary coverage of 2003. The magazine will
conduct an extensive search to find the next talented writer and editor with
the vision to continue its unique independent coverage of contemporary art
into what promises to be an extraordinary future. Jamie Badoud, Executive
Director since 2000, says, "The organization has never been stronger,"
pointing out that both revenues and circulation are at an all-time high.

Among Art Papers' latest achievements, Dr. Reeve calls the "revived public
events program, magazine redesign, and increase in writers' fees" some of
his proudest accomplishments.

Board President Che Watkins added, "It has been a pleasure working with Dr.
Reeve, and we wish him continued success as we look forward to building on
the work he has accomplished during his tenure with our organization."

The posting for the position follows:

ART PAPERS Magazine, a non-profit organization established in 1976, seeks an
Editor-in-Chief responsible for direction and content of award winning
national contemporary art magazine. The editor is responsible for soliciting
articles, copyediting, managing contributing editors, editorial staff and
interns and working with the staff during the production of the magazine. In
addition, the editor oversees the organization's public events program and
participates in planning and management as appropriate. Qualifications: MA,
MFA or Ph.D.; strong knowledge of art, culture and critical theory;
extensive experience with writing/editing, publishing/magazine production;
good computer skills. Excellent verbal and interpersonal skills work
independently, team player. Equal Opportunity Employer. Salary commensurate

Major funding for Art Papers is provided by the Fulton County Commission
under the guidance of the Fulton County Arts Council. Art Papers is funded
in part by Metropolitan Atlanta Arts Fund, the National Endowment for the
Arts, the City of Atlanta Bureau of Cultural Affairs, and the Georgia
Council of the Arts through the appropriations for the Georgia General
Assembly.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

well i've taught in five different english depts mself (not counting
grad school), some for a significant period of time... and my sense
is that talk of problems with student education or background or even
motivation shouldn't be made, in general, into a matter of deficiency
on the part of students, but should be addressed, initially at least,
more in terms of the kind of academic culture we've created...

this always takes national proportions, on one level, along with
local responses to such trends... teaching for seven years at
illinois institute of technology, we had a relatively high number of
international students, the vast majority of whom were studying
science or technology (after all, it's a tech institute)... this
rendered english into something of a service department in the minds
of many admins, regardless of how zealously those of us who taught in
humanities may have resisted the notion... and it tended to create a
class differential between relatively well-heeled international
students and the small proportion of kids who came up through the
chicago public school system (which latter these days, i take it,
have been all but eliminated)...

here at illinois state, 98% of the student body hails from
illinois... while at u of colorado/boulder (cu), 50% of the student
body hailed from outside of colorado... also while at cu, i was able
to ascertain that 40-50% of the student body came from households
where the annual gross income was in excess of $210,000 (avg.
household income was $40,000 a decade ago at iit, and $80,000 a dozen
years ago at urbana-champaign)... high household income is clearly
*not* the case here at isu, though i've yet to determine what the
numbers are... and i've found the student body here at illinois to be
far more passive, in general, than what i experienced at cu... one
sign:  rarely, and i mean rarely, will a student visit me during
office hours  (be careful what you wish for, i know!)---whereas at
cu, there were times i couldn't hold enough office hours...
again---this to me is a matter of what i'm calling academic culture,
not student deficiencies per se, even if the act scores of students
admitted here are lower on the avg than at cu... but clearly,
"academic culture" is effected by a host of variables, which include
student demographics...

in short, i've found, in my travels, vast disparities in terms of
academic settings, on the one hand, along with variously teachable
bipeds, on the other... i don't think it helps to decry things in
terms of lowered standards, grade inflation and the like---i think
the better approach is to consider how academic culture is/is not
symptomatic of culture in general, and how local
histories/perturbations have aggravated/mitigated the situation...  i
mean, at least for starters... with a clearer sense of what the
problem is---and there is always a problem---we can then talk about
what our aims are... and eventually, we can get into the sticky
matter of how to achieve said aims in curricular and pedagogical
terms... but w/o a clear sense of how students are being educated (or
worse, trained) about education, we'll likely be pinning the tail on
the wrong end of the donkey...

best,

joe

Well, in fact I was going to post to say thanks Kirby for posting the
interview link-- I enjoyed the interview with Kola Boof and knowing
what she had to say (the links to the poems didn't work though); I
was especially interested since I've travelled in Sudan--However, I
never got around to sending the post, and now that all discussion of
Boof has been reduced to tits, nude photos, and claims of rape, I am
sending it under the better late than never theory: thanks for the
interview link, Kirby; I enjoyed reading what she had to say.

So far that's been my favorite bit in the whole debate -- when Kerry
Edwards said that people should be able to marry a chair.  Eternal
faithfulness, and all that.

I'm wondering if that would be a permissable tax exemption?

It seemed worthy of Edward Lear.

Could you marry a table and four chairs?  Five exemptions?  Or would
that be one exemption, under the heading of "table set"?

All true. What we have to deal with in the interim, however, and what
should be the easiest piece to approach, is that the students come from
elementary schools that have been starved for long enough that their
teachers are products of the same overburdened and underfunded systems as
the students. A part of the problem is that the bulk of school funds are
based on local property taxes--so the relatively well-off, who have other
options, have better funded schools, the worse off, who don't, have less
well-funded schools. And the feds and the states swing back and forth in
the help they give.Meanwhile, Headstart, which all the studies indicate is
the best single program going for changing education about education in the
least well-served population, has its funding cut.

The conjugal excitement here has not - at least off the top - nothing to do
with the payment or nonpayment of taxes, other than, lacking a good physical
regimen, the possibly taxing quality posed within the sheer challenge of a
chair - that is a back and four legs instead of two.

Hi folks

I wonder if anyone has any idea who might be in charge of Kenneth
Koch's estate and how I can contact them? I need to get permissions
for a book I am writing to quote a few words from two of his plays
which were originally published by Random House.

Can I also say how grateful I am to the people who have responded to
my previous requests on the list. Your help has been extremely
helpful.

mark, absolutely, and i pretty much accept kozol's arguments about
same... there was in fact a great roundtable on this not all that
long ago at (as i recall) ~boston review~...

and i mean, as a college prof, i'm after all dealing with the fallout
from problems at the K-12 levels (not to put it simply on high school
and grade school teachers, either)... in my experience, those
students who attended either pricey private schools or public schools
in comfy suburbs are far more prepared, on the average, to do the
sort of work i'm asking for... big surprise... it's not a function of
having read such & so---it's more a matter of understanding, first,
WHY one should be able, for instance, to parse an argument... i.e.,
of grasping why such activities matter... more and more of the work i
do these days in the classroom begins by trying to debunk little
chestnuts such as "it's all a matter of opinion, and everyone has
their opinion" (offered as a way of avoiding the difficult work of
thought, verification, and so forth)...

in point of fact the conservatives, led by the work of folks like
diane ravitch and richard rodriguez, have used the notion that
students haven't read thus & so as a platform for dismantling public
education (they'd never admit to this, but this is how their
scholarship is used)... when the republicans are all through, the
only students that'll pass muster will be those coming out of, uhm,
pricey private schools...

and i mean, when our education secretary refers to the nea (national
education association, perhaps the most powerful teachers union---of
which i'm a member) as a "terrorist organization," you just know all
bets are off...

best,

joe

Kevin, Hi. I haven't been, but the  Writer's House in County Clare looks like
a great spot and is the project of the poet who runs Salmon press--an
independent publisher of poetry in Ireland. She seems like good one to give a
visit.

Mime-Version: 1.0

***CALL FOR PAPERS***

LEA Special Issue:


Network Leaps, Bounds and Misses: Critiquing Regional Strategies for Digital
Arts and Electronic Music in Asia and the Pacific

Guest Editor: Fatima Lasay <fats@up.edu.ph>

The Leonardo Electronic Almanac (ISSN No: 1071-4391) is inviting papers.


Deadline for proposals: 31 March 2004


Under the UNESCO Digi-Arts Knowledge Portal for technology-based arts and
music, an international colloquium took place on 4-5 December, 2003 at the
Sarai Center for Study of Developing Societies in Delhi, India. The meeting,
entitled "Old pathways/New travelers: new media, electronic music and
digital art practices in the Asia Pacific region", sought to launch a media
arts and electronic music initiative sponsored by UNESCO Digi-Arts and
Sarai, to promote and develop research, networking, mutual cooperation,
training and knowledge in these fields within the region. The meeting also
aimed to point out the role and place of media and technology in a social,
cultural and economic landscape inscribed by ancient histories of contact
and paths that internally connect the landmass of Asia and the island
cultures of the Pacific regions, its impact on young people and its
potential as a unique tool to promote cultural diversity.

As critical and engaging discussions of such a network of associations are
underway, what do our past and current national and regional practices
reveal about the limits of localization, proximity, and regional
reification? What lies beneath or within concepts of media and technology as
instruments for promoting cultural diversity? Is media and technology a
result or cause of culture? What is the position of media, art and
technology in the ontological divide between regionalization and
globalization? In which aspects do we need to transcend the regional level
in the regional network building efforts? What is the significance of local
ontologies within the process of building a regional network?

Can asymmetrical local and regional development and promotion of digital
arts in the region be addressed by mere institutional and conventional
proximity? If geographic proximity is insuficient, then which conceptual
spaces might provide a more solid basis for cooperative development? What
critical and realistic approaches have been and can be made, in both
imagination and actualization, to move in opposite directions and still meet
together, across the globe, in building that strong and balanced support
structure for digital arts in the region?

For the June issue of LEA, we invite contributions from artists, musicians,
practitioners, curators and critics that address regional networking
competence problems and realities in the field of digital arts and
electronic music in the Asia Pacific cultures.

LEA encourages international artists / academics / researchers / students to
submit their proposals for consideration. We particularly encourage authors
outside North America and Europe to send proposals for
articles/gallery/artists statements.

Proposals should include: - 300 word abstract / synopsis - A brief author
biography - Any related URLs - Contact details

Deadline for proposals: 31 March 2004

Please send proposals or queries to:
Fatima Lasay fats@up.edu.ph

or
Nisar Keshvani, LEA Editor-in-Chief lea@mitpress.mit.edu

I'd ask Random House directly.  When  I was dealng with rights for
Corso's work, they were sold to me by New Directions.  Some poems
weren't owned by ND, and Corso gave me those for free.  (I paid ND 300
dollars for the use of something like 20 poems, to give you a ballpark
figure.  My department paid the fee.)

wow! my dept has never picked up a permissions fee; nor are there
grants at the UMN to cover such things...but they pay for other
stuff, like the occasional research assistant (it's their way of
funding their grad students) etc.

We don't have graduate students here at this branch of SUNY, so I guess
things come out about the same.

My dean asked the vice president, and the vice president found the money.

I'm not really sure what found it came out of -- I think it came out of
something called the College Foundation.  I think that was the name on the
check.

I should know more about the corporate structure of my own institution, but
the College Foundation is a fund that the faculty donate into, and so the
money comes back to them for special uses.  There's all kinds of money
lying around in different accounts at most institutions, I think, and the
deal is to be very pleasant at annual meetings and such, so that some is
kicked your way when the time comes, I suppose, as the Zeusian figures
decide whether or not to make you happy.

"Secession"
by Amy Sara Carroll

Sometimes I simplify sadness, think of how you will leave me. I cannot=
 fathom
my heart=92s stillness, the heavy cage that will be my chest, tight-laced
breathing.

Opening a gift, we tear the paper=92s land-ho crispness. I train myself to
appreciate what disappears and what remains. If this were a fairy tale I=92d
begin,=20
Once I couldn=92t.... Now I can understand need beyond containment,

clutter-flutter, a genesis which begrudges prescience. This is the=
 beginning,
only a pinch--saucy saucers of eyes, an infant=92s dreams, all light and
darkness,

nothing as it seems, immersed in fluid, shoofly figures, voices and noises,
too
many fingers. Sensation plumbed, strata metered: touch, taste, smell, sound,
the sight. Nipple to mouth, the hungry I bleats and feeds, burps on a knee,

grows large as a continent seceding. Ni=F1a, Pinta, Santa Mar=EDa, the world=
 looms
smaller, you=92re leaving me, a dot on the eye receding, a belly-coast shore
sand-

settling into the self=92s silo, negotiating this and that, decision,=
 rejoinder,
catch
as catch can, salt-stashing away provision, little certain as our=
 magnanimous
past circumscription of the gulf. Now I feel my obligation to the ground,

gravity, it laces me down into the well of what I am, one gull=92s cry, one
wicked
hand, wishing for you, my metronome, my ocean-rhythm-whelkshell-home.=20


"Huntress Hunted"
by Becky Gould Gibson

The forest awash in coppery light,
white strokes of river,
a stag-man staggers backward,
swept beneath his hounds,
curve of their motion matched by
the curve of Diana's bow,
as the solitary goddess watches,
fresh from her interrupted bath,
tunic's gauze clinging to wet skin,
her brilliant neck exposed,
face half in light, half in shadow
like the waning moon.
A quiver strapped to her waist,
the strong-armed goddess
holds the bow as if she's released it,
yet it has no string.

So much for Titian's version
commissioned by Philip the Second
of Spain.  Imagine the scene:
an artist at the height of his powers
sets up his easel in the heart
of a forest -- Diana's sanctuary --
to paint the half-dressed virgin
who'd kill a man for less than
what he is doing.
His Diana is drained of her fury,
only a model posing with a bow,
her bodice draped open.
If such could happen to a goddess,
what hope for your sister,
her shrines mere palaces,
no place to breathe or hide,
her power unstrung. =20

Sixth Annual Urban Word NYC Teen Poetry Slam
One of the preliminary rounds of Urban Word=B9s 6th Annual Teen Poetry Slam,
where a panel of five judges will determine which poets move on to the next
level. The culminating slam will take place on Saturday, March 20. While th=
e
poetry slam is a competition, and the adult version is notorious for taking
the competition seriously, the teen slam seeks to de-emphasize the sports
aspect and highlight the diversity of young voices that the slam showcases.
Teenagers from each borough, crossing most ethnic and socio-economic
boundaries, will participate. The annual event is open to any teenager
between the ages of 13 and 19. A grassroots, non-profit arts-education
organization, Urban Word NYC uses the competitive format of the Teen Poetry
Slam to bring a community of teenagers together through their love of poetr=
y
and spoken word. [6:00 pm / $5 adults, $3 students]

All the way to the Supreme Court. This is a constitutional issue.
Or perhaps to Thomas Aquinas?
Or to Aristotle?
Or to Talmud?
Or perhaps to the Kaballah?
Perhaps Dante should have included a special punishment for those who marry=20

I am working on a poster of April poetry events in Buffalo and for Nat'l
poetry month.  Does any one know of any

1. Famous poet's April Birthdates ( I have some, but none for April
2,6,8,10,12,14,18-22,25-28,30)
2. Important historical poetic events which occurred in April.
3. Poet quotes re: april that are NOT by T.S Eliot or Chaucer

Any help would be appreciated.

How about the Civil War song "We're Marching through April?"

1
March Hare?
April there.

2
April's golden braids
were crowned with violets. She was
the May Queen of our school. The rest
were courtiers.

April was the cruelest kid.

3
May be after April, maybe. Maybe April
ends in pregnant May.

4
January's nobody's name, nor any other ary. Daughters are called April,
May, or June.
Boys are named August. Nobody's
named any ember, no matter how neat
the flames. Name somebody
March or July.

5
April spills, May allows, June is loonie.

6
Once the god was born in April,
the year also.

7
"In trips sweet May," Steve Jonas
says, "upon
those damsel feet of hers." Not a word
about April.

8
Everichon loveth
Aprille. Ac on a Mai
morniyng,
was it,
the the field was filled.


9
Turn it upside down. On the other side
October. April's
mirror, moving
in retrograde. In April
one gathers wood and shakes
the summer from blankets. In April
a god could begin to die.

10
Flower, then seed. It's April.
Watch your lap, girl.

11
Enough, then. A month
as swift as
longing. In January
(here), July
(there), time slows, and one could live--
one could think to live--
suspended
forever. April (October)
ends hibernation.
Bearish, desperate for berries.
Enough.

Did anyone else have the record of Danny Kaye=20
singing Hans Christian Anderson songs, must have=20
been from a movie....

I'm Hans Christian Anderson,
  I've many a tale to tell...

"There once was a table who said,
oh how I'd love a chair!"
Then and there came a sweet young chair
all dressed in a bridal gown.
He said to her in a voice so true,
"Oh, I did not say I would marry you,
but I would like to sit down."

As someone who'd thought this would never happen, it warms the cockles =
of
my heart. I  feel like breaking out into song! I hasten to add that res=
pect
for my fellow beings prevents me...

The crazy idea has come to me that we, as poets, should celebrate these=

wonderful events! There are so many different angles - the obvious joy,=
 the
internationalist aspects (America, for good or ill, currently "leads"
trends for quite a few countries), the rights aspects, the tensions wit=
h
"other" becoming "us", you could even include the sourgrapes at the bac=
k of
the peanut gallery...the list is endless and, well, I don't know, I jus=
t
think it's something worth capturing.

MIME-Version: 1.0

I assume his second wife (whose name I forget) has control of the estate.
She was at a presentation of Koch's poems and plays that I went to at
Columbia last year.  She gave a talk at that event and is active in
preserving Koch's work.

I first started writing poetry because of Kenneth Koch's modern poetry class
at Columbia.  He was a huge influence on me.
Koch had a decidedly non-academic approach to poetry. He talked about
figuring out how a poem works, treating it as a sort of machine which
produces an effect on the reader. Literary devices, allusions, strange
locutions, etc. are all there to give the reader pleasure. It is necessary
neither to analyze the poem nor to understand it. Instead, the goal in to
enjoy as many kinds of poems as possible, and, eventually, to write poetry
which gives other people pleasure.

Paradoxically, Koch's class led me to try reading difficult literature which
people normally study academically to understand. I dug into Eliot (of
course), Pound's Cantos, Wallace Stevens (Koch loved to quote the almost
meaningless lines "Chieftain Iffucan of Azcan in caftan/ Of tan with henna
hackles, halt!") , Joyce, Virginia Woolf. The idea that one doesn't have to
understand everything but simply enjoy it made it possible to read and
eventually write poetry which doesn't make literal sense, and therefore
opens up the way to the Modernists and Postmodern poets.

thats funny. i was actually singing that song yesterday to someone.
my friend clare latremouille showed me a picture she took of me a month
ago when we were in NY reading for BOOG, me huddled near the central park
statue of HCA. he looks frighteningly like john a macdonald, canadas first
prime minister. makes me wonder - were they ever seen together?

Please post to the Poetics list:

CALL FOR IRAQI, IRANIAN, SUDANESE, & CUBAN POETRY!

Please read this:
http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/24/1557214

When you have stopped shaking in anger, please find AND EDIT one poem or
short piece by a writer in Iraq, Iran, Cuba or any similarly embargoed
country. Be sure to include a note what editorial changes you made to the
piece. If possible, also include a brief bio or information link to the work
of the writer. English translations are great, as are works in original
languages.

Alternatively, you may submit small jpgs or gifs of poems in the original,
as long they contain photographic evidence of editing. (For instance, a
deletion mark on a comma or an inserted word or space. Spell out a number.
Capitalize something. Edit something, then stet it. Whatever.)

Poems will be posted at http://rebeledit.blogspot.com. This blog will, in
effect, become both an act of protest and a petition.

You may post or email anonymously if you like. To facilitate anonymous
submissions I have created a Hotmail account: PublicRebelEdit@hotmail.com.
You may log in at http://www.hotmail.com with the password dareyou. Please
use this account responsibly.

Please spread the word.

Thanks.

Kirby



I fully support your desire to marry a chair.



My only concerns are that you won't find it intellectually, emotionally or
physically responsive to our needs. Perhaps a vibrating pad would help solve
the last problem.



I think you might encounter legal difficulties in marrying the chair,
however. Perhaps you could approach President Bush about amending the
Constitution so that you could marry one. His gay marriage bashing is not
only disgusting, but a blatant diversion from the nation's real problems of
corrupt governments, bogus wars, greedy corporations, joblessness and
retarded presidents. But marriage to an inanimate object! Now there's
something Bush could make serious headlines with, headlines that would give
him the credibility he deserves.



I wish you the best of luck in finding the love of your life, be it oak,
pine or naugahyde.



Vernon

Poetry from Sojourner: A Feminist Anthology

Edited by Ruth Lepson with Lynne Yamaguchi
University of Illinois Press
$19.95 at www.press.uillinois.edu and at many bookstores.

featuring:

Kathleen Fraser

Fanny Howe

Lyn Hejinian

Leslie Scalapino

Denise Levertov

Rosmarie Waldrop

Julie Kalendek

...and many others

"This collection of poems reminds me of found letters that describe more
truthfully than any official history the mind-set of a generation.
Feminism--when it still related to the natural world (beauty) and was
committed to the pursuit of happiness in relationship--feminism as
narrative--from page one on IS this anthology. The existential terror and
broken (open) forms of today's poems must have emerged from these
conditions. To read them now is finally to read their meaning."

Dear Joel



Fortunately, I never married an inanimate object; they responded to my
marriage proposals with astonishing indifference. My wife is very animate,
and I can (joyfully) tell the difference. I too agree that anyone should
marry anyone or anything they wish to. Real love is too rare to be denied
for any reason. As a long-time bachelor, I know this. I believe in freedom
of choice, just as we were both taught in the days when America was America
(or at least made out to be). To anyone choosing to marry a toaster,
however, I want so say: you're likely to get burned.



Vernon

Joel,
This changes the subject from chairs to inanimate objects which ups the =
level of "kink" in the topic...I can conjure all sorts of pleasant =
thoughts of reclining as the inanimate and being chaired, or perhaps =
even better yet, of being tabled by the chair.  Then, that might not =
necessarily require matrimony.  And on that note, I must ask the list, =
Why is it matrimony?  If 'twere tables should it not be Toblerone?

there's a chair in my apartment i like very much.

but now i can't look at it (him? her?) the same,
since reading this string of posts.

there.
i've just moved it behind the desk, out of sight.

there's a lovely cushion i saw, yesterday, at the store.
made me think of --it.

but marriage?  if we did that, where would i sit?

how much rum would i have to pour down my family
in order to prepare them for such news!?

it actually makes telling that about marrying another
man seem the easiest thing in the world!

but still, no one can deny the courage it must take to
live that life with a chair, if the choice be made.

but should we next allow necrophiles to marry?
i mean, chairs are the reassembled branches and
bodies of now, very dead trees.

imagine mummified ribs, legs, collar and neck bones
hammered with nails and glue for some place to sit,
and eventually swear an undying devotion.

An old Japanese man told American poet Lucien Stryk that now that he's a
widower he regrets that he thought of his wife as a broom.

A tea house just opened in my neighborhood. Aside from selling tea it holds
free "tea tastings," presided over by a Zen tea master, followed by meditation.

Very Japanese. They also sell bamboo from their onsite nursery.

This is a desert that's quickly running out of water. Bamboo is one of the
heaviest drinkers in the plant world.

Nobody seems to notice the contradiction.

BIG NEWssssssssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Calif. Supreme Court won't immediately stop same-sex marriages
DAVID KRAVETS, AP Legal Affairs Writer
(02-27) 17:09 PST SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --
The California Supreme Court declined a request Friday by Attorney
General Bill Lockyer to immediately shut down San Francisco's gay
weddings.
Lockyer had asked the high court to take the matter under urgent
consideration, to instruct San Francisco officials to stop issuing
same-sex marriage licenses

In the paper today there's a story that states that the US Dept of the
Treasury has warned publishers who edit manuscripts from Iran or other
disfavored nations that editing the texts they publish ("Changing word,
reordering syntax, correcting grammar, or replacing inappropriate words")
amounts to trading with the enemy as does adding illustrations.  There is
a fine of $500,000 and up to ten years in prison for "criminal editing."
Editors, publishers, and translators, it says, have been briefed about the
law which states that only "Camera-ready copies of manuscripts are
acceptable."

There was a post about this yesterday, and I still don't understand it. I
gather the Treasury Dept.'s warning is directed at U.S. editors and
publishers of Farsi-language materials --but is that to prevent the edited
material's re-export to Iran, or its reception by Iranian communities in
the U.S.? As for the ban on "editing," without any directive about
*translation* it's incoherent by any standard you care to bring. And who
knew my hero was Howard Berman (D-California)? He may be unloved by
internet music-swappers, but he's welcome to dinner at my house, yo LRSN

Anybody have any thoughts on Eileen Myles' Inferno pieces that have been
appearing lately?

Also, remembering Bruce Andrews's recent stuff riffing off Dante....

has anybody written about either of these pieces
in relation to Dante, etc?

-------------------------------------------------------

Chris,

When I was reading ~Lip Service~ a couple of months
ago (I got up to page 200), I started trying to write
my thoughts on it.  My brief, preliminary notes are in
HTML format, as I even thought that a "Reading ~Lip
Service"~ ~blog~ might be in order, ---or a support
group!--- given what a strange dyslexia-inducing
experience I was finding reading it to be.

I didn't really manage to get my notes anywhere, but,
given the context of your question, I thought I'd
share them with with you---

see:
http://jeffreyjullich.tripod.com/THEDANTEBACKGROUND.htm

---(with apologies for how sophomoric and
underdeveloped they may seem).  For ~Lip
Service~-readers, their (minimal) value may be mainly
in the catalog of 40 word-for-word correspondences I
found between ~Lip Service~ and ~Paradiso.~  The
funniest of those was where Andrews "translates"
Dante's "Forse semilia miglia" as "phosphorous seed
sensimilla", and where he matches "dolce vita" with
"la dolce vita."

I would love to hear more about others' experience
with the book.  I found the phenomenology of reading
it to be quite strange and unique.  I regret that I
haven't gotten more of what I "went through" reading
it into writing: anything I had to offer was
~empirical,~ though, ---like the list of Dante
words--- without having any particular theoretical
stance to take on it all, and there isn't much place
for that sort of Show-&-Tell criticism.


---Incidentally: I expect that I'll be one of the
numerous readers at the LUNGFULL! Zinc Bar NYC reading
this evening (Sunday), 6:30 p.m.  It'll be the first
time I've read in public in 15 years (aside from
reading The Word of God in a marble pulpit at Mass).
If it happens, I'll be reading from a comic strip that

Beard of Bees, a web-based, independent, free press in Chicago is pleased to
announce the publication of The Dublin of Dr. Moreau, a chapbook of 32 blank
verse poems written with Gnoetry, a computer-generated poetry program created by
Jon Trowbridge with spiritual assitance from Eric Elshtain.

This most recent experiment found the human co-author asking the machine to
create sixteen-line quatrains using the statistical properties of both James
Joyce's Dubliners and H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau.

This, and other machine/human collaborative and purely human chapbooks can be
freely downloaded and distributed as handsome pdf files.

Please visit http://www.beardofbees.com.  Join our mailing list for information
about Gnoetry 0.1, and news about new Beard of Bees projects and publications.

Unless I've missed it, isn't "children's poet" missing
from the "poetic species" list? And how about
"nonsense poet," as Carroll and Lear are often
referred?

        Brainstorming the catacombs of a catacomplex universe.  Minds sally
under tradition.  Transduce overage swallow moonfuls & patabons of
first taught flavor.  Obvious slanderies the pen ear turned forward.
Ice cubes in milk, hairs on tits; "the brain cant really talk for
itself".  Since only one kid knows nostrils, will she remember it
matter?  Which thing cant be done without the other.
        Barely covers the flavor cold.
        Is a head there not eating.
        VW has its letters, others do so.
        Womens phrases.
        what is counting when lovings not tracing. Fire & over the church,
able.  Looking out while down at one time in two times.  Picturing
smile out at turned down eyelids unclosed & bowed.  As in brackeous not
extenuated.
        Favorite old words out of their chairs, shaving the night air.  Not
enough twisted.  The inside-out turning of the written tongue via
littles replaced or removed.  "Particles of each": hear common frasis
out of commission years later.  Inside Writing.  with the foot
clicking, somethings coming out of all this helps by looking.  She's
flue of the table.  "Nascent & able".  Lovetripped foreign kisses &
babies bright red-lights-in-a-little-box.  Gray plastic, water people
in the other room running.  Other side of the weave is color busy with
fraying.
        Im writing on towards everything.  Burse fanny gttng ovfre ut gvtp
(Little) Saint.  Though heavy to hand east, jewel therein a sign.  Let
the painting break; let the rats emerge.  Lines ever grow.  You
remember it.  Then you remember.
        When the machine arranges the page, the pen slows itself around the
corner, tilted to hear violins roar.  Im smudging the runway by jolted
passes.  Huge open faces in the hills & half-third pink at the bluff.
How people in excruciating transition look so alive, change is redder
than green.  Stations or entry ways.  Words with jaw.  Flowing
sophisticate without clothes.  Theres no end to this & more to learn
than the metaphor could push.

I am so sorry-- for you, for Lyx Ish, for the child, and for the rest of
us who will never know what she would have been able to do if she had
been able to live out a reasonable lifespan.  Pancreatic cancer has
touched my family, too.  It is one of the cruelest of all cancers, one of
the -- if not the -- least curable, and when we heal enough from losing
so many people in their primes to it, we might think about directing our
activist energies a little more in the direction of demanding more
research. . .

Thank you for your post and for the poem.  Know that we will be thinking
of you in the coming days and months.

Martha

Hi Chris,

re:  Andrews & Dante...there's an essay by Sherry Brennan that's on Jacket
(22): http://jacketmagazine.com/
"On Lip Service to Paradise."

I don't know as yet of an essay about Eileen Myles and Dante.

Also, Sue Landers is working on a large, on-going project, translating (I'm
not sure if that's the exact word she'd use) Dante's Inferno. There's a good
sampling of it in Cypress Magazine, Issue Two (www.cypresspoetry.com)

Best,

Rodrigo

Thanks very much for the poems by Lyx, after your moving notice; for people
like me, who didn't know her, they fill out something of the reality of her
loss.  My deep condolences.

To add to Gabe's notice:

The contributors (some of whom are on this list) will
receive several copies free (eventually). You know who
you are (probably). So there's no need to request free
copies.

Our website:
http://bourgeoizine.pabn.org/

Also: though the zine was founded in Normal, IL, it is
collectively edited and managed by folks around the
world, from Thailand to Cyprus, Normal to Los Angeles.

We're anticipating the production of one or two issues
a year. We're run by donations.

Best,
Joseph

on Baus' new book The To Sound:

“Birds with extremely long necks. Cassiopeia. A sister. A Marco Polo. A
somnambulist. A documentary on the voyages of Columbus. A cartographer. Star
charts. Young intellectuals in black robes. Jean-Michel Basquiat. More birds
and still more birds. A mathematician. All these things appear in The To
Sound’s beautifully warped cosmology. This is a stunning book that builds
its own world, a world of ambiguous relations and loaded words; a lyrical
world that explores the unstated connections between things. If de Chirico
was a poet... if Satie was a poet... if Maya Deren was a poet... and if they
collaborated together, they might have written this book.

The extraordinary ugliness that comes out whenever people seek to lay down rules is perhaps only uglier when there aren't any rules at all.  The Pope, speaking ex cathedra (from the chair), is supposed to be infallible.  The ugliness of this is so extreme that it makes me just barely keep my head from spinning as the little girl's does in the Exorcist.  But nevertheless that's his job.  I don't see how anybody can
lay down rules and get it right.  So I thought I was an anarchist for a couple of weeks in the 1970s.  But then I actually looked at how bad the lifestyle is among anarchists!  So now I have just decided that somebody has to lay down some rules so that we don't have to endlessly talk about who's going to throw out the old newspapers, etc.  I'm happy to let my wife do this in our house.  She's more logical and
better organized than I am.


My daughter is still bugging me about her friend Jeffrey.  They are both four.  I can't even figure out what's wrong with them getting married, so in this case I'm glad the gov't did it for me.

I would still like to marry a specific chair.  It's got a paisley seat covering and cherry wood legs.

Bigamy rules!

Dante (nano-mix)



Gazing intent, as soon as breaks the dawn:/ Through impulse kindled into =
outward flame,/ Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough/ Who =
paint the heaven through all its hollow cope,/ Quiet upon the nest of =
her sweet brood/ Regina coeli singing with such sweetness,/ Compared =
unto the sounding of that lyre/ In which, to her, grave labors grateful =
are,/ Oh, what exuberance is garnered up/ That oped the thoroughfares =
'twixt heaven and earth,/ It would not reach, singing the holy smile,/ =
Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers/ When I this =
invitation heard, deserving/ The sacred poem must perforce leap over,/=20





Both with the ancient council and the new,/ Was wholly ready, once again =
betook me/ But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,/ He who doth keep =
the keys of such a glory./ And how the holy aspect it illumed./ And =
therefore, representing paradise,/ Becoming larger, issue from itself,/ =
Hast thou become to tolerate my smile."/ Compared unto the sounding of =
that lyre/ So I beheld the multitudinous splendors/ Into my sight, that =
I could not sustain it./ With breath of god and with his works and =
ways,/ Beholding not the source of the effulgence./ That to the garden =
fair thou turnest not,/=20





Which had ascended near to its own seed./ There is the rose in which the =
word divine/ Compared unto the sounding of that lyre/ Of babylon, =
wherein the gold was left./ Dilating so it finds not room therein,/ The =
lucent substance so intensely clear/ Thou followest thy son, and mak'st =
diviner/ Which had ascended near to its own seed./ So very distant, that =
its outward show,/ To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth/ Dilating so =
it finds not room therein,/ Even as a bird, 'mid the beloved leaves,/ =
The sphere supreme, because thou enterest it."/ In vain to bring it back =
into his mind,/ And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it./=20





And what became of it cannot remember./ Should blame it not, if under =
this it trembles./ She said to me: "that which o'ermasters thee/ So did =
my mind, among those aliments/ A sun that one and all of them =
enkindled,/ Seal itself up; and all the other lights/ Thou hast beheld =
such things, that strong enough/ The lucent substance so intensely =
clear/ I was as one who still retains the feeling/ And as a little =
child, that toward its mother/ So very distant, that its outward show,/ =
For something yearns, and hoping is appeased./ And therefore, =
representing paradise,/ On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,/=20





Extends its arms, when it the milk has taken,/ The sacred poem must =
perforce leap over,/ Both with the ancient council and the new,/ There =
they enjoy and live upon the treasure/ It would not reach, singing the =
holy smile,/ That I must needs pass on without describing./ Whatever =
melody most sweetly soundeth/ Thus beatrice; and I, who to her counsels/ =
Both with the ancient council and the new,/ By whose perfume the good =
way was selected."/ And when in both mine eyes depicted were/ The joy =
sublime which breathes from out the bosom/ For something yearns, and =
hoping is appeased./ Thus did the circulated melody/ Thou followest thy =
son, and mak'st diviner/=20





So did my mind, among those aliments/ On earth, and to itself most draws =
the soul,/ For sowing here below good husbandmen!/ The regal mantle of =
the volumes all/ The joy sublime which breathes from out the bosom/ =
Compared unto the sounding of that lyre/ Who paint the heaven through =
all its hollow cope,/ Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,/ For =
sowing here below good husbandmen!/ Out of the book that chronicles the =
past./ Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough/ For sowing here =
below good husbandmen!/ Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of =
flowers/ Who, that she may behold their longed-for looks/ The joy =
sublime which breathes from out the bosom/=20





Who paint the heaven through all its hollow cope,/ And vigilant, turned =
round towards the zone/ When I this invitation heard, deserving/ =
Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,/ Underneath which the sun =
displays least haste;/ And with an ardent longing waits the sun,/ The =
welkin grow resplendent more and more./ So very distant, that its =
outward show,/ O thou benignant power that so imprint'st them!/ Whatever =
melody most sweetly soundeth/ From my awaiting, say I, to the seeing/ =
And with an ardent longing waits the sun,/ This which goes cleaving the =
audacious prow,/ There are the wisdom and omnipotence/=20

My essay, "Paradise  as Praxis:  A Preliminary Note on Bruce Andrews'
Lip Service" was published in WITZ vol 6 no 2 (Summer 1998): 5-18. It's
also available on Bruce Andrews' home page at EPC. It's just over five
thousand words, does not deal in precise detail with Andrews' use of
Dante, especially not in the way Jeffrey's notes do, and it has a few
errors (since I was working from a typescript of the poem, which hadn't
yet been published, and I got a bit confused. It's a tough read, but an
astonishingly rewarding one - Lip Service, I mean).

Chris,

When I was reading ~Lip Service~ a couple of months
ago (I got up to page 200), I started trying to write
my thoughts on it.  My brief, preliminary notes are in
HTML format, as I even thought that a "Reading ~Lip
Service"~ ~blog~ might be in order, ---or a support
group!--- given what a strange dyslexia-inducing
experience I was finding reading it to be.

I didn't really manage to get my notes anywhere, but,
given the context of your question, I thought I'd
share them with with you---

see:
http://jeffreyjullich.tripod.com/THEDANTEBACKGROUND.htm

---(with apologies for how sophomoric and
underdeveloped they may seem).  For ~Lip
Service~-readers, their (minimal) value may be mainly
in the catalog of 40 word-for-word correspondences I
found between ~Lip Service~ and ~Paradiso.~  The
funniest of those was where Andrews "translates"
Dante's "Forse semilia miglia" as "phosphorous seed
sensimilla", and where he matches "dolce vita" with
"la dolce vita."

I would love to hear more about others' experience
with the book.  I found the phenomenology of reading
it to be quite strange and unique.  I regret that I
haven't gotten more of what I "went through" reading
it into writing: anything I had to offer was
~empirical,~ though, ---like the list of Dante
words--- without having any particular theoretical
stance to take on it all, and there isn't much place
for that sort of Show-&-Tell criticism.


---Incidentally: I expect that I'll be one of the
numerous readers at the LUNGFULL! Zinc Bar NYC reading
this evening (Sunday), 6:30 p.m.  It'll be the first
time I've read in public in 15 years (aside from
reading The Word of God in a marble pulpit at Mass).
If it happens, I'll be reading from a comic strip that
I wrote when I was 11 years old.

Anyway, my point was:

Emily Dickinson Burial Gate Turns Up In Antique ShopRetired Teacher Sees Name, Year; Item Will Be Returned To Cemetery
POSTED: 2:24 p.m. EST February 25, 2004
UPDATED: 2:40 p.m. EST February 25, 2004


NEWFANE, Vt. -- A gate that once guarded the family cemetery plot of poet Emily Dickinson has been found in a Vermont antique shop.

Descendants of the 19th-century poet are now planning to return the gate to the Amherst, Mass., cemetery where it used to be. It was stolen nearly three decades ago.

The gate was discovered by a retired teacher who was shopping at the Copper Penny Antique Shop in Newfane. He noticed the year 1858 and that the name of Edward Dickinson had been cast into the iron gate.

Investigators traced the history of the gate to the mid-1970s.

But there the case went cold because the antique dealer who owned it then has since died.

The dark humorist in me - which I assume Spalding Gray might appreciate -
wants to believe that he is at work with the materials for a new piece,
"Swimming in..." (I am too far west to know if he hopped into the Hudson or
the East River). "Swimming in Cambodia" which I saw him perform in San
Francisco remains my favorite piece, the least narcissistic, the most
worldly and timely in the best sense. Sadly, it now seems, a new piece will
require someone else to write and perform the text. Like many of us in this
odd historical/national moment (Bush turning into the smell of darkened
toast over missing National Guard pay stubs!!!), I suspect Spalding's soul
is treading water before making the next move.

Dante's only contribution to literature is his language. But he =
localized the subject of literature in the individual to the detriment =
to literature. His teacher, Virgil is the truly great master. His =
subject was an Empire and the making of History. But his character, =
Aeneas is just as powerless without his mother as Dante is without =
Beatrice. Perhaps, Dante's real model is Aeneas. Only instead of =
striving to reach his home on earth, he strove to reach his home in =
heaven.

I had a discussion today with a poet friend about the decline of this
listserv, since many of the brightest lights have moved to writing Blogs and
away from discussing here and we do not have the kinds of fights that
existed before.

So I have this question for you all- it seems that poets write for poets
thus condemning our artform to an ever smaller audience,it also seems that
poets want to listen to the sounds of their own voices, by writing blogs, I
am as much at fault for this since I have two blogs, but I really wonder
where will the dialogue happen? Where will the arguments come from? it seems
that poets are ghettoized and we are not disagreeing with each other and
making the work new.

So Buffalo listers tell me what you think?
