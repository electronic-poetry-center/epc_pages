Subject:      On Walter Benjamin--forwarded from B.F.
X-To:         poetics@ubvm.buffalo.edu

I've seen over Carla's shoulder some of the back and forth about
Walter Benjamin and thought to offer a little information which
may be of some interest.  Some of this overlaps with what others
have already posted.

The story of the missing manuscript derives from the memoir of a
woman who helped guide refugees--including Benjamin--over the
Pyranees and into Spain, Lisa Fitko.

The bibliographical knot here fascinates me but may be boring to
others.  Skip to the next paragraph if lists of books aren't your
thing:  The full memoir, _Mein Weg ueber die Pyrenaeen_, appeared
in 1985, but the excerpt dealing with Benjamin was published
before that, in 1982, in _Merkur_.  Bernd Witte's _Walter
Benjamin:  An Intellectual Biography_, published in German in
1985 and in 1991 in English, refers to the _Merkur_ excerpt
("`Der alte Benjamin':  Flucht ueber die Pyrenaeen"), which was
published in English translation in _Orim:  A Jewish Journal at
Yale_, 1:2, Spring 1986, pp. 48-59 (under the title "The Last
Days of Walter Benjamin").  Susan Buck-Morss in her fine study of
the Arcades Project, _The Dialectics of Seeing_, makes use of the
Fitko memoir but draws all her information from the copious notes
to the German edition of the _Passagen-Werk_, which was first
published in 1982.  Making the whole business particularly
strange is the fact that the _Passagen-Werk_ published an English
version of the _Merkur_ bit (now titled "The Old Benjamin").
Apparently, Fitko's account came to light just as Rolf Tiedemann
was bringing the _Passagen-Werk_ to press, and there wasn't time
to commission a German version.  Fitko settled in Chicago after
the war and apparently wrote the memoir in English.  (Thus Witte,
writing in German, cites the _Merkur_ version, while Buck-Morss,
writing in English, cites the _Passagen-Werk_.)  One question
remains, though:  why does _Orim_ retranslate the piece into
English from German?

After giving an account of the journey itself, including its
tragic conclusion, Fitko writes (I'm citing the _Orim_ version
here):

          Forty years later, in 1980, I had a conversation
     with a Professor Abramsky of London.  We talked about
     Walter Benjamin and his work, and I mentioned his last
     walk and the manuscript.  Soon afterward I had a call
     from Professor Gershom Scholem, a trustee of Benjamin's
     literary estate and his closest friend.  He had heard
     from Abramsky about our conversation and wanted to know
     more.  I described the events of that day in late
     September 1940.
          "But at least the manuscript that meant so much to
     him was saved," I remarked.
          "There is no manuscript," said Scholem.  "Until
     now no one has ever heard of it.  You must tell me
     every detail . . ."  The voice on the telephone went
     on, but all I heard was:  "There is no manuscript."
     And all those years I had assumed that it had been
     salvaged.
          The manuscript was never found, neither in Port-
     Bou nor in Figueras or Barcelona.  Only the black
     leather briefcase was noted by the Spanish border
     authorities, with the remark:  _Unos papeles mas de
     contenido desconcido_--"with papers of unknown
     content."

Buck-Morss repeats the various speculations about what this
manuscript might have been which Tiedemann offers in his notes,
but it seems to me that this manuscript was almost certainly NOT
the Arcades Project, which Benjamin had squirreled away with
Bataille's help in the Bibliotheque Nationale.  In his last
letter to Adorno, dated 2 August 1940 (the last letter in the
newly published English edition of the _Correspondence_),
Benjamin especially remarks

     the complete uncertainty in which I find myself
     concerning my writings.  (I have relatively less reason
     to fear for the papers devoted to the _Arcades_ than
     for the others.)  As you know, however, things are such
     that my personal situation is no better than that of my
     writings.

This same letter, by the way, mentions his having attempted "to
obtain permission . . . to go to Switzerland on a temporary
basis, if at all possible."  A footnote tells us that permission
was not forthcoming.

Further, a cryptic passage near the end of the letter refers
Adorno to a "Mr. Merril [sic] Moore" of Boston, to whom "Mrs. W.
Bryher, the publisher of _Life and Letters Today_, has often
called . . . attention."  I don't have a copy of the German
edition of the correspondence where more information is perhaps
provided, but that "often" certainly implies that Benjamin had
been in touch with Bryher on more than one occasion, presumably
in consultation about leaving the German-controlled parts of
Europe.  Merrill Moore, by the way, I remember from high school
anthologies as a psychiatrist poet who wrote sonnets by the
thousands.  (No kidding--one of his books, titled _M_, consisted
of a thousand sonnets.  New Directions, among other publishers,
brought out his work.  I later read that he was one of the
psychiatrists who attended to the Frost family.)  Was Moore a
contact person for refugees in the States?  All in all a murky
area of history.

Subject:      The Advert-Garde

I am not a terrific fan of Terry Eagleton's, but his
answer to Eric's question ("how do I not become a
commercial") is a compelling one.  In *The Ideology
of the Aesthetics,* Eagleton writes:

   If they can place your revolutionary artefacts
   in their banks then that means only one thing: not
   that you were not iconoclastic or experimental
   enough, but that either your art was not deeply
   enough rooted in a revolutionary political movement,
   or it was, but that this mass movement failed.  How
   idealist to imagine that _art_, all by itself, could
   resist incorporation!  The question of appropriation
   has to do with politics, not with culture; it is a
   question of who is winning at any particular time.
   If _they_ win, continue to govern, then it is no doubt
   true that there is nothing which they cannot in principle
   defuse and contain.  If _you_ win, they will not be able to
   appropriate a thing because you will have appropriated
   them.  The one thing which the bourgeoisie cannot incorp-
   orate is its own political defeat.  (372)

This of course recalls Benjamin's "and the enemy has not
ceased to be victorious" (in "Theses")....

As it evidently was for Eric, the "recuperation" of punk
was a formative event in my own intellectual trajectory--
a lesson learned.  What I didn't know at 16 was the history
of similar recuperations--including that of the avant-garde.
But I can't think of anyone in G2 who doesn't at this point have
the lesson learned by heart: the question is what to do with
the knowledge.

My thinking is that the indispensable element of the avant-garde
project is not "experiment" so much as what that term presupposes:
autonomy.  The historical a-gs saw the bourgeoisie as the greatest
threat to their autonomy; today's avant-garde recognizes the systemic
nature of that threat--i.e. the fact that capitalism is more than the
sum of "shockable" (concrete) members of the bourgeoisie.  From the
50s to the 70s "the establishment" provided a homologous "other."

The avant-garde project (which, as I think Paul Hoover suggested in
his recent post, is not to be abandoned but further radicalized)
cannot honor its internal drive towards autonomy without running
into capitalism as its fundamental obstacle.  Anti-capitalism is
partially inscribed in its history, and generally inscribed in its
current conditions of possibility.

Anyway, some thoughts--obviously too bluntly, too hurriedly stated.

The second sentence of this oft-quoted passage from Benjamin's Theses on
the Philosophy of History becomes rather luminous in light of the list's
recent speculations on B's "last days":


There is no document of civilization that is not
at the same time a document of barbarism. *And just
as such a document is not free of barbarism, barbarism
taints also the manner in which it was transmitted
from one owner to another.* [emphasis added]


B. is talking, of course, about the way an unreflective historicism tends to
hold aloft the "spoils" of the "victors."  But the flip side of his thesis,
one imagines, wld have to engage the *dis*appearance of the documents of
the defeated...

Merrill Moore was also one of Robert Lowell's psychiatrists: kind of an
in-house job (not totally unlike Freud and the "K" family I guess, but
STILL....) at that: Lowell's mother worked as Moore's secretary and she
and Moore may I think the story is also have been lovers.  Odd to link
Benjamin to Lowell however tenuously (and not especially edifiying....)

thar she blows....

What interests me in the discussion of Adorno and Benjamin, a marginal
interest mind you, is how it has now become conflated with the issue of
how to posit opposition--this in relation to Pape's and Evans' recent
posts.  Adorno, obviously believed avant-garde/modernism to be a form of
resistance/critique of bourgeious (sp) culture; Benjamin (having only a
familiarity with "The Work of Art . . .") seems if not to hold the same
attitude (though obviously different) at least attuned to way in which
technologies of capital had the capacity to empty Modernist
culture/critique and re-produce them as so many commodities of exchange.
It is interesting how this dilemma is still with us, dead, but still with
us.  Eagleton is perceptive on this point precisely because he points how
those forms of culture/critique are forms produced by capital itself: and
punk is an excellent example: if the sex pistols are any indication,
their whole "project" was a commodity-form produced to  feign resistance,
but actually part of it and its processes.  It destroyed, but in the name
of capital--it simply reinscribed it.  This, in order to move towards
poetry, is a dilemma many modernists dealt with in their "experiments"
with language--that is, attempting to use language in new and unusal ways
in order to create/discover new meanings/senses; of course, if it wasn't
dadaesque "non-sense," it had to use the language it had at hand.  In
other words, the modernists were particularly concerned with using an
existing language in order to say something different (am I getting this
out right?).  And this, it seems to me, to be precisely the sort of
dilemma that we are faced with in seeking not to become commercials; and
perhaps an answer might lie (or lay) in that direction.  Maybe not.  What
I am thinking, though, is that, for instance, writers of the Harlem
Renaissance often made use of traditional forms but infused them with
issues of otherness, with race matters (to echo Cornell West).  This
seems a dangerous strategy, but perhaps it is one and one only in an
arsenal.  Questions, highly underrated, seem also a way of avoiding
subsumation to the mouth of this beast that consumes all to itself in
order to create its song (ah, what a perversion that is. . . .).

Re Steve Evans' citation of Eagleton on cooptation being a function of
who does or doesn't win the (a) revolution: seems right in its way, but
the Jameson (pomo book) which it ignores seems righter: that something
has changed in relation of base to superstructure ("implosion" Jameson
calls it after Baudrillard) which alters the status of cultural objects;
and (implicitly) that this alteration is not simply solved toot court by
the right side winning something.  Such that: the alteration ought itself
to be part of what the art work takes up (or takes down).

MICROSOFT Bids to Acquire Catholic Church

By Hank Vorjes

VATICAN CITY (AP) -- In a joint press conference in St. Peter's Square
this morning, MICROSOFT Corp. and the Vatican announced that the
Redmond software giant will acquire the Roman Catholic Church in
exchange for an unspecified number of shares of MICROSOFT common stock.
If the deal goes through, it will be the first time a computer software
company has acquired a major world religion.

With the acquisition, Pope John Paul II will become the senior
vice-president of the combined company's new Religious Software
Division, while MICROSOFT senior vice-presidents Michael Maples and
Steven Ballmer will be invested in the College of Cardinals, said
MICROSOFT Chairman Bill Gates.

"We expect a lot of growth in the religious market in the next five to
ten years," said Gates. "The combined resources of MICROSOFT and the
Catholic Church will allow us to make religion easier and more fun for
a broader range of people."

Through the MICROSOFT Network, the company's new on-line service, "we
will make the sacraments available on-line for the first time" and
revive the popular pre-Counter-Reformation practice of selling
indulgences, said Gates. "You can get Communion, confess your sins,
receive absolution -- even reduce your time in Purgatory -- all without
leaving your home."

A new software application, MICROSOFT Church, will include a macro
language which you can program to download heavenly graces
automatically while you are away from your computer.

An estimated 17,000 people attended the announcement in St Peter's
Square, watching on a 60-foot screen as comedian Don Novello -- in
character as Father Guido Sarducci -- hosted the event, which was
broadcast by satellite to 700 sites worldwide.

Pope John Paul II said little during the announcement. When Novello
chided Gates, "Now I guess you get to wear one of these pointy hats,"
the crowd roared, but the pontiff's smile seemed strained.

The deal grants MICROSOFT exclusive electronic rights to the Bible and
the Vatican's prized art collection, which includes works by such
masters as Michelangelo and Da Vinci. But critics say MICROSOFT will
face stiff challenges if it attempts to limit competitors' access to
these key intellectual properties.

"The Jewish people invented the look and feel of the holy scriptures,"
said Rabbi David Gottschalk of Philadelphia. "You take the parting of
the Red Sea -- we had that thousands of years before the Catholics came
on the scene."

But others argue that the Catholic and Jewish faiths both draw on a
common Abrahamic heritage. "The Catholic Church has just been more
successful in marketing it to a larger audience," notes Notre Dame
theologian Father Kenneth Madigan. Over the last 2,000 years, the
Catholic Church's market share has increased dramatically, while
Judaism, which was the first to offer many of the concepts now touted
by Christianity, lags behind.

Historically, the Church has a reputation as an aggressive competitor,
leading crusades to pressure people to upgrade to Catholicism, and
entering into exclusive licensing arrangements in various kingdoms
whereby all subjects were instilled with Catholicism, whether or not
they planned to use it. Today Christianity is available from several
denominations, but the Catholic version is still the most widely used.
The Church's mission is to reach "the four corners of the earth,"
echoing MICROSOFT's vision of "a computer on every desktop and in every
home".

Gates described MICROSOFT's long-term strategy to develop a scalable
religious architecture that will support all religions through
emulation. A single core religion will be offered with a choice of
interfaces according to the religion desired -- "One religion, a couple
of different implementations," said Gates.

The MICROSOFT move could spark a wave of mergers and acquisitions,
according to Herb Peters, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Baptist
Conference, as other churches scramble to strengthen their position in
the increasingly competitive religious market.

And Lowell was Grenier's first important teacher, thus from Benjamin

Steve is quite right about the reiteration of recuperation from one
generation to the next. Rae Armantrout once noted that every few years
she gets to show another set of students that they did not invent the
attitude captured in the Rolling Stones' album "Let It Bleed" (the
Stones didn't invent it either).

About 10 years ago, McDonald's had a campaign to promote its emerging
breakfast menu (the idea of fast food breakfasts being one of the great
market expansions of the past 15 years) that used the tag line of

              DAWN GOOD FOOD

which, when I first saw it, felt entirely inspired by the writing of Bob
Grenier's *Sentences* (just turn the W upside down), much in the same
way that display ads in the 20th Century learned much from the use of
the line break of WCW. Look at any newspaper circa 1910 and you will see
the difference.

Grenier's distance from critical writing since founding This magazine a
quarter century ago has always seemed to me an attempt to avoid the
exact kind of cooptation that that McDonalds ad already has accomplished
for him.

Obviously it would be nice to think that you and I are not implicated in
the atrocities that occur in Bosnia or Rwanda or East Timor. But we are.
We are directly and personally responsible. Each one of us.

That has always seemed to me to be the most immediate lesson of the war
in Indochina.

The problem of dropping out (or any other metaphor of purist distain for
the establishment's use of one's soul) is that there is no Out. Out is
simply a safe place that In has set aside to keep Out from making too
much unpleasant noise.

Ultimately, the problem of opposition is not one of how to avoid
becoming a commercial. You can't. Trying to do so just wastes time. The
question rather seems to be one of positioning what happens when/as you
do. Here the most tragic situations have been those who apparently
thought it would somehow "solve" something. Brautigan for example.

I find it intriguing, to say the least, to see where Kit Robinson, Tom
Mandel & James Sherry, three of the poets of my own G1-hood who I take
to be among its most serious political thinkers (Sherry's Nuclear
Heritage is the most completely & directly political work any of us have
accomplished, it seems, a project at once both of ambition and courage)
have chosen to work. Certainly not the academy. None disdains the human
drama of the marketplace. Sherry currently is employed by Phillip
Morris, which ranks somewhat ahead of the Khmer Rouge in total number of
fatalities caused over the past 40 years.

I've worked on ads that have appeared in the Wall Street Journal, NY
Times, Forbes, Fortune and other bastions of liberal thought. And I work
for a company whose clients include both houses of congress, and the
departments of defense and justice. Not to mention most of the
corporations one might hold an attitude about. Including Phillip Morris.

I think that what I (or James or Tom or Kit or anyone) gains far more
from exposure to that world than from abstinance. This is where I think
the alternative approach has many of the same problems I associate with
anarchism, which is another mode of the Out position. (Anarchy is not a
political system but rather a transitional state...and always one on the
way to feudalism it would seem.)

I think that we are entering a very dark time politically. And a very
dangerous one. Experimentation would at best be a distraction. But who
wants to be distracted in a burning building?

The U. of Louisville hosts its annual Twentieth-Century Literature Conference
Th. Feb. 23-Sat. Feb. 25, 1995. We have just put together the program, and I'm
seeking interested folks to chair panels (which typically follow an MLA-type
format: 3 papers and discussion, hour-and-a-half). We need chairs in all areas
of twentieth-century Anglophone and non-Anglophone lit., theory, and some
film; there's a wide range of poetry panels to be chaired. Conference chairs
get a reduced rate on registration ($40), and get to come to a good
conference.

Guest readers/speakers at this year's conference include Charles Bernstein,
Susan Rubin Suleiman, Maria Damon, and Robert von Hallberg. The program will
include various G-1 and G-2 participants, as well as many others of differing
alphabetical and numerical persuasions. If you're interested in coming, please
contact me privately at acgold01@ukyvm.louisville.edu, letting me know your
areas of interest/expertise. Thanks.

Yes, I agree, that the problem of opposition is not to avoid becoming a
commercial but of positioning oneself "when/as" you do. . . but "waste"
of time is also what others might consider a useful strategy.  I shy from
absolutes where opposition is concerned: I don't want to believe, whether
it's naive or not, that "ultimately" we all become objects of
appropriation.  I want to reserve some possibility of . . . .  Perhaps
the building is burning, but can't we renovate afterwards?

I'm so glad Ron Silliman brought up Bosnia because I have been horrified
by the lack of response on the part of friends, colleagues, etc.  I mean:
even as we sit around discussing the Spanish Civil War and which radicals
did what, we don't protest the Serbs (who really are just like the Nazis)
making a Bosnian wear a fez and taunting him just as the Nazis forced
Jews to wear the swastika.
(read Anthony Lewis's editorial in NY Times today).  All that stuff about
an "ancient feud we can't do anything about" is what people said about
the Nazis too.

I refer members of the net to our mutual poetry friend Dubravka Duric,
now back in Belgrade, as well as to my former student and now assistant
prof of Slavic and Comp lit at U-Washington Seattle, Gordana Crnkovic,
who is half Serb, half Croatian and has strong feelings as to what we as
Americans might do   Gordana (Goga) will be speaking at MLA on the
East-european panel I've organized for Comp Lit--along with Ewa and
Krzystof Ziarek and Marcel Cornis-Pops.  Would any of you like to get
together with Goga at MLA?.
What ideas for action do others have, now that our government, the UN,
and NAtO have totally sold out?

I hate to be always being such the dissertator, returning to the
"Objectivists" so obsessively, but Silliman's "burning building" reminds
me of Oppen's statement from "The Mind's Own Place": "There are situations
which cannot honorably be met by art, and surely no one need fiddle
precisely at the moment that the house next door is burning.  If one goes
on to imagine a direct call for help, then surely to refuse it would be a
kind of treason to one's neighbors.  Or so I think.  But bad fiddling
could hardly help, and similarly the question can only be whether one
intends, at a given time,to write poetry or not."  Clearly, in Oppen's
case, the "or not" has real weight.  And since our general late
captitalist malaise *does* seem to be taking an even more sinister turn
these days, when do we reach the point where we find ourselves imagining(?)
that "direct call for help"?

Everybody has to answer that one on their own i suppose.  Oppen, for his
part, doesn't presume to dictate a response.  As for what art *can* do, he
suggests that "the definition of the good life is necessarily an aesthetic
definition" & quotes William Stafford about the poet trying "to find what
the world is trying to be."  Also suggests that "it is possible that a
world without art is simply and flatly uninhabitable."

        PARIS (AP) -- Guy Debord, an avant-garde essayist who influenced
the upheavals of French society in the late 1960s, has committed
suicide. He was 62.
        Town officials in the village of Champot where Debord lived
announced an investigation Thursday into the suicide. No details
about how Debord took his life Wednesday were disclosed.
        Little-known outside France, Debord denounced what he called
``the show-biz society'' and declared that performing arts should
be based on powerful emotions, passions and sexual desire.
        His ideas were influential among theoreticians and essayists who
achieved prominence in the May 1968 student-led cultural revolt
that shook French society.

Ben Friedlander passed this bulletin on to me from a clarinet list.  I
had not yet heard about Debord's death.  Having just read the new
and worthwhile translation of The Society of the Spectacle for my
current graduate seminar, Debord has been very much on my mind.
(The description of his work in the notice is quite odd.)

On Wednesday Guy Debord decided to take a most final early retirement
from this scene. "Doctor of Nothing," he called himself & was a poet,
painter, film-maker, essayist, agitator, theoretician, founder of the
IS (the Situationist International). Without his work, without the
leaven of his thought, what is now called "les evenements de
soixante-huit" i.e. the French part of the '68 uprising, would have
been a dour affair. There will be ample time for considered
panegyrics, appraisals of The Society of the Spectacle, & the business
as usual of enshrinement & auto-da-fe.

        Tonight's the time for a joyous not-so-finnicky wake, with a
bottle of red wine & his last book,a very unconsidered & hilarious
PANEGYRIQUE, in which he writes of his life-long rabelaisian
penchants: "What I've done best is drink... I, who have had to read so
often the most extravagent lies & insinuations concerning myself, or
the most unjust critiques, am very surprised that thirty years & more
have gone by all in all without a single one of those malcontents
having tried, even implicitly, to use my drunkeness as an argument
against my scandalous ideas." Tomorrow we'll reread the books, look
again at the films, re-argue his definitions of "situation," "derive,"
"detournement," "decomposition." Because, to "deturn" a famous line,
"le siecle sera Debordian ou ne sera pas."

Silly as it might be, stating our solidarity with Bosnia and lodging our
disagreement with the course of action (lack thereof) the US has taken
would be a good start.  There has been terribly little of either from
artists, academics . . . at least that I've seen.  Also, I'm not above
inserting, when ever and where ever the opportunity presents itself, a
reminder that there is a war in Europe--and that it does affect us, as
has been dramatically stated here.  What is our role--if any--as
artists/academics (or whatever) in speaking out against such crimes?  I
don't want to speak for anyone but myself, but I feel I have a
responsibility, if only to myself, to say SOMETHING when I am able.  And,
as an artist/academic, I have that privilege.  I don't mind using it.

Glad to see Ron's post re: Exile on Main Street.  There certainly is no
"out" and you don't have to be Marxist to see it.  I had the pleasure to
hear a lecture by Amiri Baraka yesterday: "So that since the U.S. is an
imperialist country, with a monopoly capitalist economic base,
the institutions raised on that base, as well as the philosophies expressed
within them, are in the main expressions of imperialism."  The only thing
that matters is the economic base, and without the moderating influence
of a competing morality such as the church or local community, our economic
life is focused on selfishness. It is in the interest of consumerism,
therefore, to destroy traditional values including religious and/or
ethnic values ("peasant traditions" in WCW's "For Elsie").  Relativism
and indeterminacy (and alas the well-meaning avant-garde) apparently
collaborate in this.

Like Lew Daly (apparently), I was raised in a German pietist tradition
that argued against material possession and chose separation from the
world.  This separation worked primarily on the symbolic level, since
inevitably one must trade with "Das English" as the early Brethren & Amish
called them.  My interest in poetry derives from that background.
Good works, if not transcendence, through writing. But the desire for
fame and office brings dominance back in, and we become little
imperialists.  Baraka was wonderful to hear and full of satiric fire.
But the talk was given in an institutional setting (my working-class
arts college in Chicago) on a grant from the Lilly Foundation and his
fee for the day was $5,000.  We all work out of an economic base that
extends to poetic value. Inevitably, one poet is perceived to be "worth
more" than another. Susan Howe and Nathaniel Mackey rise; someone else
falls.  We are currency, and what else is new?

It is possible to interpret multiculturalism as further ghettoization
funded by the MacArthur and other foundations; it is masked,
however, as "community building."  Their goal is to bring enough marginal
people into the high-tech middle class that revolution will not seem
necessary.  Meanwhile, as Andrei Codrescu wrote in a recent essay, the
real revolution, the triumph of global capitalism, continues apace.

The American peasant, Williams saw in horror, has no traditions.
Except perhaps his/her "television heritage."

The great ideological disaster of the last 25 years has been
separatism.  But how are potentially conflicting peasant traditions to
live together?  By cruising the same mall or watching an Arnold
Schwarzenegger movie?  Yes.

There will be two future cultures:  those who primarily watch TV and
those who primarily work in front of a computer screen. Everything will
be mediated by light. For high art, one goes out to a "film."

Last night on TV (I dropped my cable and really miss it) that an
orthodox rabbi from california likes to surf:  good eye candy but under
it a very cheap laugh.  TV despises dignity, and consumerism hates
seriousness.   Peasant traditions still have some dignity left.  We
observe this dignity on PBS sponsored by some foundation.  We are
relieved and a little surprised that blood sacrifice of llamas still
occurs in Bolivia.  Disturbed by the violence, we turn to a sitcom.

We feel responsible for Bosnia because we imagine that we might turn our
military dominance toward good works.  But we are not at all in the
post-colonial age.  The control is still there, just not the troops.
Nothing happens in Bosnia because powerful interests are a lot
more committed to GATT, NAFTA, and consolidating global capitalism.  They
will deal with Bosnia only when it threatens trade, as we saw in the Gulf
War.

The list might be interested to know of a compelling account of the
Bosnian crisis--other than _Zlata's Diary_--by Slovenian poet Ales
Debeljak, _Twilight of the Idols:  Recollections of a Lost Yugoslavia_
(published by White Pine Press, Fredonia, NY).

Ales, who read this past fall in Buffalo, raises a number of questions
about our intellectual commitment to multiculturalism from the perspective
of a society where tolerence for other religious and ethnic identities
has utterly collapsed.  I recommend the book; too bad it hasn't sold
(i.e. been promoted) as well as the cherubic Zlata.

Long a proponent of the issues of engagement which Ron raises as opposed
to the Senecan views espoused elsewhere, here, and in art circles in
general about purity of purpose, I must say that I have gone from bad
employer to worse. My current job is at Deutsche Bank has put me in the
position of having to hold contradictory ideas more than ever (not
that I would ever buy a Mercedes).

Acting in the drama has always been for me more amusing. But social
change, being inevitable, requires less effort on the part of the
individual that most suppose. For example, many of you know about a
credit card company called Working Assets, an employee owned corporation
that returns a portion of its income to not for profit organizations
chosen by the people who use the credit card.

Now WA is getting into the phone business. Along with my new phone
company goes several free calls a month to a politician: the dialectic in
action. Here they have given us credit cards to control us and happily
control goes both ways. This bisynchronous control is engagement. It is
also the risk that many artists and thinkers will not take.

If we do not vote with guns, we may vote with our bank accounts. I suggest
that Marjorie, Ron, and others who wish a point of view to be
organized as well as Pat Robertson and IMF/World Bank need to start thinking
about contemporary notions of what organization means. NOT just passing
information back and forth...

The separation of information and meaning has given us new credentials.
If we choose to use them we may make a mistake. If we choose not to use
them we may not make much of anything.

Thanks Ron for the opportunity to open this issue.

I would argue that "social change"/exchange is a bit more complicated than what
a company like Working Assets would like its customers to think.  I certainly
like the idea of giving money to not for profits and getting free calls to
politicians.  However, Working Assets uses Sprint long distance lines.  Right
now Sprint is up before the NLRB on unfair labor charges.  Sprint fired 235
Latina workers a week before they were going to vote in a union representation
election (this is happening in San Francisco). If one really wants to take part
in the "bisychronous control" that the idea of organized labor is built around,
one will use AT&T, the only phone company that's allowed its workers to
unionize.

Somehow this idea of "voting" through a particular consumer activity does not
strike me as a gratifying political efficacy. Perhaps this is because I don't
really have a bank account worth mentioning. I guess I'll have to figure
something out with words.

Just a note, as I'm not certain if Paul Hoover's citation of the setting
and fee for Amiri Baraka's lecture was a criticism of Baraka or the
institution or just the state of the world. This is just to say that it
is important, as Silliman notes, where one works, and where one strikes
out for position or opposition. As a former participant in the Tucson
Poetry Festival in Arizona, I helped arrange for Baraka to read and
lecture, and the fee was far less (less than one fifth) of $5,000. The
setting was not institutional (or at least not a big institution like a
university or museum, rather a site rented a cut-rate by a small
non-profit group in which no one is paid), the audience was about 300 for
the reading; an overflow crowd heard the lecture. I believe that
art/culture has a role to play in the community, and that unfortunately
academic/institutional settings act as a filter which do not allow that
role to be played.

That is but one reason why public reading series large & small, &
independent presses, are so important. Not that they can't be made into a
commercial, but new ones come along all the time and the
positioning/oppositioning goes on.

I'm wondering if a connection can be made between the two recent threads--
  the earlier discussion of identification and identity within the poetry
  world and the more recent thread on politics. The first discussion seemed
  at times poignant, as members of various generations sought to identify
  themselves and place themselves in positions of prominence--with laments
  about displacement and loss of identity for some.  Underlying the discussion
  was the reality that the "politics" of poetry is certainly pre-democratic,
  primarily feudal or courtly. I do not think that the truly prized commodity
   is money, prizes, etc. but rather prestige or honor-- and while one could
  use a market metaphor for this, the true operating system of poetry is
   not even as democratic as a market.The discussion of generational names,
    for instance, seemed to veer between a marketing strategy on the one hand
   and a rather heartfelt and therefore poignant desire for simple recognition
     -- "je veux qu'on me distingue". which is very far below Rimbaud's
    "je est un autre."The most revolutionary platform I could imagine for
 our poetry would be a return to pseudepigraphia and anonymity.
Could the failure of poetry in our time to have a major audience
  on the scale Whitman dreamed of have anything to do with the disconnection
    between the  office  politics of the poetry world (feudal, courtier) and
   the larger society in which we live and function?

Isn't it pretty to think so?  By which I mean, wouldn't it be nice if
what happened w/in "the poetry world" (which one?) and what happened in
"the larger society" (again) were married?  Then we wouldn't have to wait
so long to find ourselves important, w/ "a major audience," an
audience-of-scale.  Alas, there are two delightful minors on my
comfortable suburban street who call out when I walk by, "Hello, Poetry
Man!" because they just love poetry, it's their favorite subject in
school (4th grade), and they depress me no end.  By the time they make it
through high school, I suspect, they'll know the same two things about
poetry my freshmen do:

1)  I don't understand it.
2)  I don't like it.

And when some stray shmuck asks them, at the end of a survey course, to
choose the poem that's given them the most pleasure this semester and
apply Zukofsky's "Test of Poetry" to it--just what _were_ its pleasures
in sight, sound, & intellection--they'll be baffled.  Like, no one's
asked them about pleasure since fourth grade.  Like, don't you want me to
tell you what it MEANS?

If there's a stumbling block placed in their path, we didn't put it there.

Subject:      Shake Those Dirty Hands

I appreciate the candor with which James Sherry
and Ron Silliman have recently discussed their
"positions" vis-a-vis corporate power, but I am
as suspicious of the subjective titillations of
"holding contradictory ideas" (which cd easily
mean: deceiving myself about the meaning of my
actions) as I am of fantasies of a "pure outside."

Ron suggests that he and James and Kit Robinson
and Tom Mandel have "gained more" from their en-
gagements with corporate capitalism than they
would have from "abstaining" from the "human drama
of the marketplace."  Since I gather that Ron has
"gains" of other than a financial sort in mind when
he writes this, I would be interested in knowing
more about these gains.  Is it a matter of gathering
intelligence (so to speak) that informs one's oppositional
work--one's poetic practice, one's political practice as
a citizen, one's critique?  Is it a matter of actually
exercising counter-agency *within* the arena of corporate
power, or of obedience in one domain being converted into
dissidence in another?

I have to admit that the politics of occupational complicity
do not strike me as especially viable--which is another way,
I guess, of saying that the contradictions incurred along
Ron and Jame's way(s) don't strike me as strongly "positioned"
ones.  (By the way, I intend no disrespect to the personal
resonance such contradictions may have for the few people who
experience them.)  Nor do the "dialectics of the credit card"
go very far toward redressing, eg., North-South relations.

There seems to me a difference between saying: (1) our attempt to
curtail or abolish the power of capital has evidently failed,
and the available "choices"--given this failure--are for the
most part unacceptable ones that I nevertheless have to accept;
and (2) my ability to actualize a radically ungeneralizable
trajectory is in fact a measure of my political acuity and a
sign of my superiority to those who "abstain" from "complicity."

The vacuity of "dropping out" is not proof of the acuity of
checking in.  Both smack of extreme voluntarism in light of
the *structural* exclusions of global capitalism.

One final point, the implicit contrast in Ron's defense
of market coercion (qua human drama) is to academia. Not
overlooking the structural connections between the corporations
and the universities, it does seem worthwhile to point out
the obvious fact that whereas the corporations have *no*
interest in Ron's or anyone else's poetic practice, the
universities do (and where that interest is not pursued,
it can at least be raised; which is not possible within
the context of Philip Morris, etc.).

Having said all of this, I remain interested in reading
more about Jame's "rethinking" of organization, and in
seeing more from Ron about the "gains" of dirtying one's
hands (one must adjust that metaphor, I think, in light
of the great keyboard of techno-capitalism: clean hands?).

Though surely pleasures are learned as rigorously as discursive genres.  A poet
recently told me he didn't read poetry for pleasure.  "I mean lets face it,"
he said, "when it comes to pleasure, enjoyment, relaxation, I'd rather watch
Terminator."  There are pleasures that poetry strives to avoid, to unlearn,
to counter.

And as for the decline in readership, In Memorium was the last bestseller, which
which the queen kept on her bedside table, and maybe that's why.  The market
isn't as democratic as it appears.

I don't have any problem with reading poetry out of a sense of duty or whatever.
Our only subject here has been ethics.  Like the song from my youth said,
"I feel like I owe it to someone."

Dear Tom:

As if we are in exile, but also at home there. Yes. Giorgio Agamben,
discussing the work of Robert Walser, writes:

        The Irreperable is the monogram that Walser's writing engraves into
        things. Irreperable means that these things are consigned without
        remedy to their being-thus, that they are precisely and only their
        *thus* (nothing is more foreign to Walser than the pretense of
        being other than what one is) [you could add Emerson here, too];
        but irreperable also means that for them there is literally no
        shelter possible, that in their being-thus they are absolutley
        exposed, absolutely abandoned.

To recognize there is no shelter other than our own responsibility
(Agamben says our own "possibility or potentiality") and that neither
lamentation nor praise is the issue is to be at home. Otherwise, home
turns into in a tank named "Relations of Production" rolling toward
Tiananmen Square.

However, for those of us who are employed by academic insitutions to do
non-academic work (or at least work not related to our poetic practice),
the difference betwen the two brands of corporations is negligible.

And, cynically perhaps, I have to wonder whether large academic/research
institutions' interest in "Literature" or "Art" really goes much deeper
than the decorative -- do university trustees and administrators see poets
(esp. in all the proliferating Creative Writing programs around the U.S.)
as much more than status-symbols, like famous works of visual art in
lobbies of major corporations or sponsor-blurbs on PBS specials?

With the millions being poured into huge brick biotech and supercomputing
facilities rising all around the margins of campus and frequently making
national headlines, instances such as Bob Perelman's lecture here last year
(attended by 25 people?) or John Ashbery reading this coming Wednesday,
seem positively quaint, and hardly something in which the corporate
university is "interested."

Yes, but isn't this a much too simple reduction, a too regressive
determinism, a too restrictive vulgar marxism?  If the capitalist
econo-political structures determine expressions congruent to itself
where do individual and collective rejections of those expressions come
from?  Those structures, too, are infused with an--often perverted--forms

Yes, perhaps, but this rejection of "community building" and its negative
association with separatism--endowed or not--is itself a refusal of the
"radical" political impulses motivating multiculturalism--I think of Gloria
Anzuldua, here.  Infusing extant political structures with excluded
"others" is "radical," and if that is not accomplished through
"revolution" from without but from within does that make it any less
"revolutionary"?  This assumes, of course, that rather than infusing
extant political structures and parties with "minorities" (a
non-essentialized description, if you please) that "difference" actually
becomes a part of them. . . .

No, I don't feel responsible for Bosnia--or anything else for that
matter--because we can exercise military power there as a form of
self-gratifying sentimentalized "good works" (no offense intened here).
I have always been uncomfortable calling for the use of such violence to
influence the situation--as much as I agreed with Bosnia's call to let it
defend itself.  I believe in responsibly exercising my own ability to
link my fate to others--if I were in a situation where I was being
shelled I hope someone would seek to help me in what ever way they
could.  Richard Rorty's Contingency, Irony and Solidarity is useful on
this point: suggesting that the basis of human solidarity is actually
suffering, that this common experience should be enough to bind us.  If I
see someone suffering I know it could just as easily be me . . . .

Dear Friend,

Bernadette Mayer was hospitalized on October 11th for
intracerebral bleeding--equivalent to a stroke.  She underwent
neurosurgery and is presently reovering.  At the moment she is
unable to speak or write.  Due to the seriousness of her illness,
it's not clear when she will be completely rehabilitated.

Bernadette needs your support to help pay her rent, phone bills,
utilities, any expenses Medicaid won't cover and for the care of
her three children.  Any financial gift you can contribute will
help her through this difficult time and allow Bernadette to
concentrate on regaining her health.

An important and repected poet, Bernadette has been involved in
the New York City poetry community for many years.  She served as
director of the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church from 1980-84
and since then she has lead numerous writing workshops at the
Project and at The New School for Social Research.

Bernadette has published fifteen books of poetry and prose,
recently, _A Bernadette Mayer Reader_ (New Directions 1992) and
_The Desires of Mothers to Please Others in Letters_ (Hard Press
1994).

Subject:      vulgar marxism

To:  Jeffrey Timmons

I thought someone might comment on Baraka's "vulgar marxism."
Interesting phrase, "vulgar marxism," suggesting that its basic concepts
are to be discredited because we are now so much more sophisticated.  Do
you imagine that the economic base is NOT a dominant concern?  That the
United States, along with G7 (the only "G" force that really matters,
with regard to G1/G2 discussion) does NOT manage world affairs?

As for Baraka's fee, it's of course a comment on the state of the world
and ironies of value.  If the Lilly Foundation has $5,000 for a visiting
lecturer/poet, it might as well go to him.  There were perhaps 80
people in the auditorium, so the foundation paid about $60 a head.  There
was, however, a television camera recording the event, conceivably the
most important member of the audience.  As soon as the applause died
down, a young man stood up and began to denounce the hypocrisy of the
conference--I believe because he supports "vulgar marxism" and sees that
the university sponsorship of such statements as Baraka's makes them
absurd.  This young man wrote a book called "Bomb the Suburbs."  I
learned from him earlier that he attended Oberlin as an undergraduate,
and something rings absurd about that, too.

The vulgar marxist has been replaced by the chardonnay marxist.  In the
80s even revolution went upscale.  I'm not saying I'm not part of it; if
Baraka is correct, everyone is. Market forces are so convincing that if you
produce a ragged-looking literary magazine, as was the style in the late
60s, that too is designed for audience appeal.

One thing for sure:  we live in a video serfdom.  If you don't "mach
schau" (make show), as the early Beatles fans in Berlin demanded of the
fledgling group, you're starting to disappear.  To quote the character
Egon in Ghostbusters, "Text is dead."  It's a new marketplace, with new
technologies, and this requires a new literature.  Those on this
listserve group are of the economy that stares into computer screens--
more text oriented.  Did you know that for the last two or three years
they have had performance poetry events at the Associated
Writing Programs conference?  This year there's even a "stand up" night.

On the other hand, a more courtly literature still exists, and it is
powerful.  The real problem is to find a literature of any kind, courtly
or vulgar, of intelligence and spirit.

Back in this recent series, Don Byrd made a very good comment about
avant-garde poetry being the "mainstream" historically, especially if you
begin with romanticism.  In a bookstore today, I spent a lot of time reading
selections from various poets including one who was a National Book
Award  winner.  It was awfully dreary reading.  Embarrassing even.  But
I could clearly see the truth of Don Byrd's premise.

concept here than persuaded).  I saw this magnificent opera.  It is based
on and "samples" Euripides' WOMEN OF TROY and CNN with lots of life
in between.  Does anyone know about the fate of this opera?  Does anyone
know how/whether such a project of launching this somewhere here
can be/is being undertaken?  It isn't, after all, an opera that would
benefit from the $$$$ machines needed for Pavarotti, &tc.  Anyway, a
response to this query would be appreciated, though I am not the one
to know the next step in this particular avenue.

Last note, there are several most important and engaging newsboards
on the internet re: former Yugoslavia and peace groups that still
persist on the ground there.
I was in Croatia summer of '93, and I can say that peace is far from
assured.  In fact, as with Chamberlain in Sudentenland, the cards are
set to fall with the appeasements and concessions.  Peace does not
come from facing down aggression with "neutrality."  What to do?

Subject:      Out/onomous

I'm a bit curious about something I've picked up as a kind of cerebral
distinction (as opposed to actual/real or even possible distinction)
between out and autonomous.

It appears that many of us agree that there is no out:

Tom Mandel's:

>"Outward" i.e. a gesture. there is no outward; every vector has a
>direction.

Yet the meta-metaphysics envolved in:

>                       perfect is one to whom the entire
>                       world is a place of exile.

appears to me to be an inverted origin and re-invigorates a kind of
clearing, a place where metaphysics can and cannot take place....a
straddle....

&

Steve Evan's:

>My thinking is that the indispensable element of the avant-garde
>project is not "experiment" so much as what that term presupposes:
>autonomy.

and the trenchant:

>The vacuity of "dropping out" is not proof of the acuity of

>the *structural* exclusions of global capitalism.

Steve's repositioning of the "avant-garde" project as a social (autonomous)
rather than scientific, or theoretical (exterior) is important. However,
what I'm not sure of here is the relationship of both "out" to "auto" -nomy
 in the face of the "structural exclusions of global capitalism."

I've been reading Joan Cock's *The Oppositional Imagination* the last few
days, finding myself under the transformative power of a searing critique,
and while I don't pretend to be as fluid or nearly as capable as she, I do
find many common concerns; one of which I believe would be that it is very
hard to speak of "autonomous" or "out" in the above senses.

In the midst of a critique of Said's, Gramschi's, William's and Foucault's
models of "dominative power" she writes:

"There is...a vitality to power at the molecular level and a fixity to it
at the grand one, so that approaching it theoretically from the bottom is
the surer way not to miss its variations, reversals, and diversions. And
when it comes to the local detail, one must be ready, if not quite for
anything, at least for many unpredictable and surprising things. Whatever
the great situation, this particular one, being particular, might bend in
all sorts of ways - towards some new and intensified form of the power
prevailing on the grand scale, or towards some humbled version of it, or
towards its deterioration, or towards its inversion." - p 49

In relation to both Steve and Tom, I'm gleaning two things from this quote:


One, that the propositions of "structural exclusion of global capitalism"
and "the world is a place of exile" both in-state forms of world (though
geo-physically with "global") that appear on the surface to refute an
outside while running the risk of imposing an outside. Both "structural
exclusion of global capitalism" and the world of exile seem to run the
risk, of proposing an absolute and of reifying hegemony. That in fact "the
matrices of transformation" that poetry can involve are "constant
modifications" (the *constantly* burning house),  both internal and
external, "local" and "geo-political" power fluxes which constantly undo
the absolute "world", or "globe."

And Two, exile and exclusion are impossible in this undoing and with this
impossibility, "out" and "auto," though intended differently, are actually
more similar in their exclusivity than not. (In this, there is no "closet"
either.)

I'd like to tease this out further but I have to go out and pick up my
wife.

Certainly Eagleton's point (and y'all's) is well taken. Which is why the whole
sell out question, to corporate america or to academia,is a non-question.
Doesn't it imply at some point we were not all already sold?
     Mostly we've been engaged in the politics of identity...Does it
matter, to use use Ron's perfectly apt metaphor, in what room you stand
as the building burns down?
     What I've been asking is in fact a formal question. Which is, can we
imagine a form which resists domination? The answer is of course, as we
have all noted here, at length, that it is an impossible question. There
is no outside, etc...But just because it is an impossible question, I don't
believe that makes it any less important...Perhaps more so.
     What determines oppositional form? Only if we imagine a constellation of
effects (B's word) can we imagine oppositional form. Only if we imagine that
there is a within to the art work; a within that functions semi-autonomously,
can we imagine an art work that resists incorporation. Because of course
never can any art work resist entirely incorporation. There must always be
aspects that in effect support domination. The question becomes is there any
that are oppositional.
     We have never been able to imagine totally oppositional art. It never
happened. Not even to Milton. The question becomes then not a matter of
identity, ie, am I Marxist enough to be a poet, but of form.
     But we haven't avoided Ron's final image, ie, the distraction in the
burning building. By positing only formal resistence, do we not risk Formalism?
How great of a risk is that, truly? Also, we have Marjorie's question. If our
resistence is not simply a matter of technique, a matter of how we put
together our art, then what can we do? The question, also, is impossible,
but is the most important question anyone has asked here: What can we do?
     Thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu)

To Kamenetz' Rimbaud citation I add "Que je suis rentier." Alas for those
who'd equate poetry with a humane politics. Considering Whitman's
attitude toward Native Americans. Dickinson's difficulty leaving the
house. Basho's spying for the emperor. Hafiz sucking up at the court. Of
course Pound, Yeats, and Eliot. As Ron points out politics is not where
it is represented to be. And further what is error free politics but
attitude.

Steve Evans "well reasoned" response is blistered with the attempt to
make himself whole by thinking about it. I think that I and possible Ron
although I don't want to speak for him, wish to contrast an exclusionary
politics with an inclusive one which we all participate in as Charles
Alexander points out. Steve as usual makes excellent points within the
confines he has established. My position vis a vis corporations is the
recognition that I work for them and that academic life would provide
distance from them but does not sever the relationship. How close do you
want to get?

Charles Bernstein and I were in Belgrade a few weeks before the civil war
broke out. Belgrade has a large mall of coffee houses running down its
middle. By day and by night the coffee houses were overflowing with
unemployed young men between the ages of 18 & 25 who were talking about
how it might be possible to get some money by fightingin this war and old
men talking about how it might be possible to use them to do so.

Marjorie Perloff has made the case for this at length (& depth) with her
analysis of the French reading of American poetics. It's still quite
true.

And it's disturbing to see that we ourselves sometimes forget this. I
remember being furious to see, in the New Princeton Encyclopedia of
Poetry and Poetics (in the entry on American Poetry) that Michael
Davidson and Albert Gelpi identify "the major trad. of the 1970s and
'80s" to be 3 general areas of practice: Ammons, Pinsky, Gluck (Louise
not Bob), and Hass being one, Bell, Gallagher, Levine, Wright and Forche
being the second, Howard, Merrill and Hecht being the third.

That's disinformation, not just misinformation.

And about as silly as TVF Brogan (one of the volumes two general
editors) identifying The New American Poetry as being by Donald HALL,
not Don Allen. Or, for that matter, Paul getting the title of Zukofsky's
long poem incorrect throughout the Norton Pomo.

If we continue to perpetuate our own marginalisation, it should be for
strategic (not merely tactical) reasons. The alternative is just
compradore poetics.

(Raised eyebrow):  Fascinating, Captain.  First, we have the equation of
pleasure and enjoyment with relaxation--not what my friends the
rock-climbers describe, or the rock and roll guitarists when they're
licking up their chops.  Notice, too, that there's no pleasure in duty,
or in ethics, in paying your dues (to whom, exactly?).  No one ever
really _enjoyed_ dishing soup to the homeless, or calling for US
intervention into Spain / Bosnia, or unmasking the "illusions of
pleasure" that capitalism has purportedly foisted upon us (cf. McGann, in
that old essay on Politics & Poetic Value).  No:  pleasure is what
happens when you turn off your forebrain and watch Arnold blow away good
guys, bad guys, til' you've had your share of biochemical thrills.  Then
it's back to the serious business of ethics, our only subject here.

I just don't buy it, finally.  I think that the pleasure / ethics split
is bogus and reductive--the Victorians knew better.  So did the Greeks.
I think the equation of pleasure with ["mindless"] relaxation is, too.
Maybe this just means that I'd rather curl up with Mirabell than Mad Max,
or spank a monkey that's been dead since, oh, Lautreamont. But I don't
think so.  There's a knee-jerk anhedonia in critical discourse these days
that seems to me as questionable as the use of words like, oh,
"experimental," and that could use the same sort of theoretical and
historical unpacking.  It seems (pause) illogical.

Aye, Twould be interesting to see / when Pleasure was declared to be /  the
enemy of Poetry--or, at least, given its purgative, medicinal function,
when Poetry became the enema of pleasure.

give up, after reading the really frightening exchange on vulgar Marxists
versus Chardonnay Marxists and other similar items.  This is not an issue
of yet again discussing "late Monopology capitalism," now a fact of life
around the globe anyway, but to discuss what to do about Nationalist and
religious wars that practically recall the Crusades, not to mention Hitler.
It's not a question of whether Bosnia is in our "sphere of interest" but
what will happen if we don't intervene now--and should have intervened
years ago.  The Serbs (total thughs and, incidentally, from what Dubravka
tells me, overtly in favor of a Male, authoritarian, "back to the soil"
literature movement, given the signal that they can do whatever they damn
please in Bosnia, will now continue on to Hungary and/or Albania.  It's just
a matter of time.  Is this our concern?  Well, was Chkekoslovakia our
concern in 1939?  Poland?  do we really not care what happens in Europe?

Can we do anything?  Yes, first of all inform yourselves (thank you
Kathryne for the list) and stop talking about our own petty little
concerns in the university or whether or not Imamu Baraka deserves $5,000
and write to our congressmen, draft ad campaigns, etc.  This is REAL not
one more hypothetical debate between various Marxisms.

I am a G4 in the textual body of a G3.  For roughly twenty years
I have sought psychosurgical intervention for my problem.  Now,
with the ever-collapsing interior folds of cyberspace, I can
begin to see the damp at the end of the tunnel ...

10100001001010010010010010100101001000010100010010000100100011


In L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E #3 (and later The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book), we
printed Bernadette Mayer's compilation of writing "experiments".
Over the years I collected additional experiments and changed
some on the original list to reflect a somewhat different
orientation.  Given the conversation here lately, or not so
lately perhaps (it just has taken me a long time to get this
out), I hardly need to note that calling such lists as this
"experiments" is tendentious.  Perhaps it would be more
accurate to call the list a series of nontraditional poetic
forms.  Experiments, I suppose, is the term that gets used for
such lists to contrast with the ubiquitous books of writing
"exercises" for creative writing class; in this sense,
"experiments" are exercises with different poetic motivations and
lineages: and one which, I would say, thinking of Eric Selinger's
comments just now, do emphasize pleasure, or anyway the fun of
writing.  The common dislike of the term "experimental poetry"
can, I think, be traced to such work being disparaged as mere
"exercises", preliminary and incidental to the "actual work" of
poetry.  In this way, both "exercise" and "experiment" are
deployed, positively and negatively, against assumptions about
intentionality, related to the that other binary pair, process
versus product.

I use the "Experiments" list in my work as a teacher. (I used to
work for corporations, but now I {just} work for the state.)  Indeed the
first class I ever taught at a university (UCSD) had the official
title "experimental writing", which was appealing in that
"poetry", that vexatious term, didn't appear (the other class I
taught that quarter was entitled "advanced poetry" for which, of
course, I designed a completely different syllabus).  Nowadays I
use the "Experiments" list not so much for teaching writing, but
for teaching reading, that is, some of the "experiments" work as
methods for "reading" through poems and others work as ways of
approaching, if not imitating, certain poetic methods. I bill my
classes these days as "reading workshops" and refer to working
with this list as doing "something like lab work", shamelessly,
and falsely, appealing to if not the prestige of science perhaps
the acceptance by students that in science they will be dealing
with methodology and form -- and also, obviously, to encourage a
different way to think about reading poetry, linking two things
most students don't associate -- scientific experiment and
poetry.  Actually, I distribute a shorter version of this list
for "reading through" -- the ones that involve using prior texts,
but it will be apparent which ones will work for this and which
not.



********(((((((((((((((((((((()))))))))))))))))))))**************

Anyone notice this full-page statement opening the new Exact
Change catalog?:

"RECENTLY a major publisher brought out a huge anthology of
contemporary American poetry and title it 'post-modern' for no
better reason that the that the term 'avant-garde' sounded too
old-hat and the term 'experimental' seemed to connote failure.
Well, it's time to revive these two perfectly good adjectives and
take back our modernism from the learned bores of postmodernism.
Besides, it never really went away, you know, it's here with us,
superbly alive and well in the _Exact Change Yearbook_."

                                  --John Ashbery

Perhaps "our modernism" is something like Ashbery's often quoted "the other
tradition", a.k.a Don Byrd's mainstream, a.k.a. radical modernism, a.k.a.
formally innovative poetry, a.k.a. "that poetry of which we speak" ... Exact
Change runs a striking half-page color ad (black and white drop out lettering
on red background) in the new New York Review of Books headlined "Classics of
Experimental Literature" and featuring books by Aragon, Roussel, Lautreamont,
Stein, Cage, de Chirico, Soupault, Appolinaire, Kafka.  (I have most of these
and highly recommend the entire set.)     I haven't seen the Yearbook yet, by
the way, but it is edited by Peter Gizzi, & includes a Michael Palmer feature,
and a CD. $35 from Exact Change, Box 1917, Boston, Mass. 02205 (who'll also
send you the catalog -- or maybe we can get an electronic version to post --
are you listening Peter?). The term "experimental" does not appear in the Exact
Change catalog, except in Ashbery's inside front cover statement.  This use in
the ad suggests an active, indeed commercial sense of the term, at least in the
(considerable) judgement of Exact Change publisher Damon Krukowski.  Of course
one could easily note that "experimental classics" is a touch, well,
oxymoronic; but let she or he whose rhetoric is without oxymoron complain, I
certainly am in no position to.  In contexts like this, "classic" is a way to
undercut the assumption that "new" or "experimental" works are
undifferentiatable in respect to quality -- how can you tell one from another.
(Pay attention is one possible answer.)  New Classics plays off the sense of
"classic" as having enduring value against the sense of "classic" as being
traditional: I'd translate the expression as, something like, a work of
untraditional value, valuable, in part, because it is untraditional or
unconventional, but not exclusively for this reason.   I would say the most
common, and empty, charges against nonconventional literary works is that they
are _only_ about their nonconventionality or antitraditionality or, so the
refrain goes, only about "language"; as if one breaks forms or finds new one
for sake of that activity rather than to be able to make articulations not
otherwise possible. I would say such comments (and they are just as frequent in
the alternative poetry worlds as in the mainstreams) mask the fact that
conventional and traditional literary writing reinscribe the meanings implicit
in their forms but that poetry is not limited to this activity of reinscription
(lovely or comforting or pleasurable as it sometimes may be).  There may be no
pure outside (chorus: "no pure outside" "no pure outside") but there isn't no
pure inside either (chorus: "no inside ether, no inside ether").   -- I
remember going to some marketing meetings when I was working for _Modern
Medicine_ in which they told us the readers (all physicians) were most likely
to read an article if the word "new" was in the title.  This will come as no
surprise to any who drinks New Coke in their New Chevrolet, even if we are
still bedeviled by the fact that Madison Avenue understands "make it new" quite
well -- yet, against all odds, I would still say, _understands it differently_
.  In _Modern Medicine_ the spin had a different moral imperative: "new cure
for", "new protocol for" etc., so that the audience felt compelled to read
these items in order to be competent, or, negatively, in order not to be sued;
at the meeting we were urged to say new whether or not the item was new.  This
works because there "actually" are new developments in medicine with which
physicians need to keep up: "new" is open to manipulation not because it is
meaningless but because it is a marker of "practical" value.  To say that
marketing capitalizes on the claim of the new does not mean that newness is an
empty claim: the difference between Madison Avenue's claim's and poetry's
practice is one of motivation and ethics.  SO, echoing Williams, I would say
there is still news from poetry, and that women and men do die from the lack of
what is found there (but not only there and it is surely not the only thing
they die from the lack of).


============@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@=====================


Over the years, I have come up with many labels, names,
movements, and candidates for popular catch-words or art-critical
jargon.  I consider this similar to the activity (certainly not
experiment!) of coming up with fifty possible names for a new
poetry magazine).  Few of my candidates have caught on, but as I
toss out so many I shouldn't be surprised if once and a while my
somewhat pataphysical namings enjoys a brief half-life.  A young
friend (e.g. "younger than me") recently wrote me to ask if I had
realized that a book of poems I quite admired was actually
written by him, though published under a pseudonym in a tiny
edition.  Since he seemed to want to enter into the social space
of poetry, I suggested he include his own name in future
distribution of the book.  Still, the gesture struck me as a
radical position about names and labels:  read the work.  I
remember Spencer Selby, years ago, complaining that magazines
accepted work, and readers read work, based primarily on name
recognition; he proposed that work be published anonymously.  A
similar point was made here yesterday by Roger Kamenetz. While I
understood the point, I had to admit that I like knowing who
wrote what and didn't want to give up the frame, and the history,
for the sake of what I suppose Spencer thought would be more fair
-- a level playing field?
     Let me close with one more observation:  three main
yarns/braids (which I propose as an alternative term to 'threads'
in cyberspeak) on the Poetics list have revolved around questions
of the configuration of poets and/or poems: community in the
spring, anthologies in the summer, labels in the fall. Now with
winter, we seem to be focussing on war: the destruction of some
communities by other communities.

To James Sherry-- I certainly would not equate poetry with humane politics.
   My point was that the politics of our poetry scenes is no better than
   the politics we are complaining about. Judging   Whitman for his blind
  spots  is using blinding 20-20 hindsight. Who among us would survive that
  judgment, if we had the knack of turning it on ourselves?I suppose we can
  be no kinder to the poets of the past than we are to our rival contemporaries
  : purges all around, off with their heads.

Which would suggest that as ineffectual as a butterfly flapping its wings
the artist/intellectual/whatever has about as much influence. . . and
that it would be silly not to recognize it.  Pape's revision of Perloff's
question is the important one: what do we do?  We talk. . . and talk, and
that is what we do.  Do. And that flapping is as ineffectual/powerful as
the butterfly's wings. . . perhaps poetry is not a "humanizing" or even
"civilizing" force (which I don't think it necessarily is) but it does
exert influence/power and the ethics of that power are recognizable.  Is
what we do simply "entertainment?"  Or idle chatter?  I'd be the last to
say the artist/intellectual knows any better than the next person, but
isn't there something as pernicious in abandoning that potential as in
misusing it?  Geez, I'm not a humanist, please. . . .  But seriously (as
if), our chatter is not as subsumed within systems of capital as it is
portrayed as being.  I work within the university because it allows me
freedom (no matter how limited or limiting) to think in ways that seem
"oppositional"--whereas if I worked at a job for a company I would have
to think what it wanted me to.  Little difference some of you are saying;
well, that's not how I experience it.  Would we be having this
conversation behind the counter at Taco Bell?  "Two tostadas, one seven
layer, pintos and cheese, and a medium Pepsi--to go."

Yes, yes, yes, yes and what I was interested in was if we (those who are
members of the list and the artistic/intellectual community) might be
able to speak in some sort of larger-than-single voice on the issue.  I
can write my congressman, etc, but isn't it important that my voice be
represented as not simply alone in saying these things?  I abhor the way
we have all stood by and allowed people to be shelled as a matter of
daily course and prevented Bosnia from defending itself without saying
this is a lame way to conduct human affairs.  But I want to join my voice
to others in order that it have more effect than speaking alone.  I would
like to join my name (for what its worth) to a list of creative persons,
academic sorts, who recognize the need to speak collectively about this
situation in order to draw attention to it. I would only add that the
discussions of marxism are important--as everything else
discussed--precisely because in sorting out these matters and differences
between ourselves we identify where we can speak together or not.
Marjorie Perloff raised the issue--what can we do--and we have discussed
it.  This is a good thing, though, of course limited, but I don't want to
renounce the discussion as "hypothetical"--especially if it has some REAL
outcome.  Is it now happening?
        Having said all this I'd like Kat to append the list of persons
in England (or whereever) who are active in this issue, as well of the
lists of internet resources she knows about on Bosnia.  She could send to
me or, better, the list as a whole.

X-To:         Poetics@UBVMS.BITNET

EXPERIMENTS

1.  Homolinguistic translation: Take a poem (someone else's then
your own) and translate it "English to English" by substituting
word for word, phrase for phrase, line for line, "free"
translation as response to each phrase or sentence. (Cf: Six
Fillious by nichol, McCaffery, Fillious, Brecht, Higgins, Roth.)

2.  Homophonic translation: Take a poem in a foreign language
that you can pronounce but not necessarily understand and
translate the sound of the poem into English (ie French "blanc"
to blank or "toute" to toot).  [Cf Louis and Celia Zukofsky's
Cattulus]. (Rewrite to suit?)

3.  Lexical translation:  Take a poem in a foreign language that
you can pronounce but not necessarily understand and translate it
word for word with the help of a bilingual dictionary.  (Rewrite
to suit?)

4.  Acrostic Chance.  Pick a book at random and use title as
acrostic key phrase.  For each letter of key phrase go to page
number in book that corresponds (a=1, z=26) and copy as first
line of poem from the first word that begins with that letter to
end of line or sentence.  Continue through all key letters,
leaving stanza breaks to mark each new key word.  [cf: Jackson
Mac Low's Stanzas for Iris Lezak.]  Variations include using
author's name as code for reading through her or his work, using
your own or friend's name, picking different kinds of books for
this process, devising alternative acrostic procedures.

5.  Tzara's hat.  Everyone is a group writes down a word
(alternative: phrase, line) and puts it in a hat.  Poem is made
according to order it is randomly pulled from hat.  (Solo: pick a
series of words or lines from book, newspapers, magazines to put
in the hat.)

6.  Burrough's Fold-in:  Take two different pages from a
newspaper or magazine article, or a book, and cut the pages in
half vertically.  Paste the mismatched pages together.

7.  General cut-ups:  Write a poem composed entirely of phrases
lifted from other sources.  Use one source for a poem and then
many; try different types of sources: literary, historical,
magazines, advertisements, manuals, dictionaries, instructions,
travelogues, etc.

8.  Cento: write a collage made up of full-line of selected
source poems.

9.  Substitution (1): "Mad libs".  Take a poem (or other source
text) and put blanks in place of three or four words in each
line, noting the part of speech under each blank.  Fill in the
blanks being sure not to recall the original context.


10.  Substitution (2): "7 up or down".  Take a poem or other,
possibly well-known, text and substitute another word for every
noun, adjective, adverb, and verb; determine the substitute word
by looking up the index work in the dictionary and going 7 up or
down, or one more, until you get a syntactically suitable
replacement.  (Cf: Clark Coolidge and Larry Fagin, On the Pumice
of Morons.)

11.  Serial sentences:  Select one sentence each from a variety
of different books or other sources.  Add sentences of your own
composition.  Combine into one paragraph, reordering to produce
the most interesting results.

12.  Alphabet poems:  make up a poem of 26 words so that each
word begins with the next letter of the alphabet.  Write another
alphabet poem but scramble the letter order.

13.  Alliteration (assonance):  write a poem in which all the
words in each line begin with the same letter.

14.  Doubling:  Starting with one sentence, write a series of
paragraphs each doubling the number of sentences in the previous
paragraph and including all the words used previously.  [cf:
Silliman's Ketjak]

15.  Collaboration:  Write poems with one or more other people:
alternating lines (chaining or renga), writing simultaneously and
collaging, rewriting, editing, supplementing the previous
version.  This can be done in person, via e-mail, or through
"snail" mail.

16.  Group sonnet:  14 people each write one ten word line on an
index card.  Order to suit.

17.  Write a poem trying to transcribe as accurately as you can
your thoughts while you are writing.  Don't edit anything out.
Write as fast as you can without planning what you are going to
say.

18.  Dream work:  Write down your dreams as the first thing you
do every morning for 30 days.  Appply translation and aleotoric
processes to this material.  Double the length of each dream.
Weave them together into one poem, adding or changing or
reordering material.  Negate or reverse all statements (I went
down the hill to I went up the hill, I didn't to I did).  Borrow
a friend's dreams and apply these techniques to them.

19.  Write a poem made up entirely of neologism or nonsense words
or fragments of words.  [cf: Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky",
Khlebnikov's Zaum, Peter Inman's Platin, David Melnick's Pcoet.]

20.  Write a poem with each line filling in the blanks of "I used
to be ----- but now I am -------".  (I used to write poems, but
now I just do experiments; I used to make sense, but now I just
make poems.)

21.  Write a poem consisting entirely of things you'd like to
say, but never would, to parent, lover, sibling, child, teacher,
roommate, best friend, etc. etc.

22.  Write a poem consisting entirely of overheard conversation.

23.  Nonliterary forms: Write a poem in the form of an index, a
table of contents, a resume, an advertisement for an imaginary or
real product, an instruction manual, a travel guide, a quiz or
examination, etc.

24.  Imitation:  Write a poem in the style of each of a dozen
poets who you like and dislike: try to make it as close to an
forgery of a "unknown" poem of the author as possible.

25.  Write a poem without mentioning any objects.

26.  Backwards: Reverse or alter the line sequence of a poem of
your own or someone else's.  Reverse the word order.  Rather than
reverse, scramble.

27.  Write an autobiographical poems without using any pronouns.

28.  Attention: Write down everything you hear for one hour.

29.  Brainard's Memory:  Write a poem all of whose lines start "I
remember ..."  [Cf. Joe Brainard's I Remember.]

30.  "Pits": Write the worst possible poem you can imagine.

31.  Write a poem while listening to music; switch types of
music.

32.  Write a poem just when you are on the verge of falling
asleep.  Write a line a day as you are falling asleep or waking
up.  (Cf: Silliman's Circle-R.)

34.  List poem: write a poem consisting of favorite words or
phrases collected over a period of time; pick your favorite words
from a particular book.

35.  List poem 2: write a poem consisting entirely of a list of
"things", either homogenous or heterogenous (common lists
included shopping lists, things to do, lists of flowers or rocks,
lists of colors, inventory lists, lists of events, lists of
names, ...).

36.  Chronology: made up a list of dates with associated events,
real or imagined.

37.  Transcription:  Tape a phone or live conversation between
yourself and a friend.  Make a poem composed entirely of
transcribed parts.

38.  Canceling: Write a series of lines or rhymes such that every
other one cancels the one before ("I come before you / to stand
behind you").

39.  Erasure: Take a poem of your own or someone else's and cross
out most of the words on each poem, retype what remains as your
poem.  [cf: Ronald Johnson's RADI  OS from Milton.]

40.  Write a series of ten poems going from one to ten words in
each poem.  Reorder.

41.  Write a poem composed entirely of questions.

42.  Write a poem made up entirely of directions.

No, no, no--I don't think marxism's concepts are "discredited" because we
are more sophisticated, but because the systems of capital more complex
than when Marx conceived the relation of base/superstructure.  And, no, I
don't imagine that the economic base is not a dominant concern, just that
I want to move away from deterministic conceptions of the relations
between different spheres of cultural production.  I like Gramsci's
model.  Yes, I agree with you on these points, but I don't want to be
reduced to acting always in syncronicity with some economic determinism,
you know?  Ya, ya.  Thanks for lettering me clarify.

I would voice support of Sandra Braman's tentative foray into describing
the issues in terms of dynamical systems methods rather than the polar
inside/outside criteria which discussion fell around previously. The
notion that we can define an internal order to turbulence is fundamental
to much of our poetics positioning. The metaphors of dirty hands and
burning buildings are to say the least inflammatory and being derived
from experience carry all the risks of a theory based on memory rather
than a coherent analysis from which poetry can deviate, become chaotic,
and as conditions change return to the order of which we speak. These
states participate in a continuum rather than as a polar switch. They are
digital, not analog, and open more doors than they close, which for me at
least seems an good place to start.

my sister served as an intern in our (ex)Congresswoman's office--according
to her, _10_ letters in one direction or another served as a significant
influence on that legislator's perception of her constituent's wishes.
tho it might make _you_ feel more effective to ally yourself with others

Rodger's point, earlier, was an important one. Up to now we've been assuming
that there is only one kind of capital, ie cash. That might be all there is,
bottom line, but Pierre Bourdieu (I don't know much about his personal life;
if he abuses barnyard animal I am sorry for using him) writes:
  Thus, at least in the most perfectly autonomous sector of the field of
  production, where the only aundience aimed at is other producers (as with
  Symbolist poetry_, the economy of practices is based, as  in a generalized
  game of 'loser wins', on a systematice inversion of the fundemental principle
  of all ordinary economies: that of business (it excludes the pursuit of
  profit and does not guarantee any sort of correspondence between investments
  and monetary gains), that of power (it condemns honours and temporal
  greatness), and even that of institutionalized cultural authority (the
  absence of any academic training or consecration may be considered a virtue).
And further on:
  In other words, the field of cultural production is the site of struggles in
  which what is at stake is the power to impose the dominant definition of the
  writer and therefore delimit the population of those entitled to take part
  in the struggle to define the writer.

While Bourdieu is certainly writing about the French poetry community, there
may indeed be similarities between that and the, for lack of a better term
the American avant garde.
     Not that there isn't problems. The good thing is that it demystifies the
claim of the avant garde to special authority due to their lack of authority.
The bad thing is that it really doesn't tell us anything we didn't already know
--About the conflict between theory and praxis: I have a great deal of sympathy
for both. But  ultimately theory has to articulate itself as praxis; in poetry
or in politics, it has to be done. Thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu)

Yes Rodger, I agree, we can be no kinder to ourselves than to the past
and we must be as thorough critiqing our own positions and politics as we
are in analyzing those of our opposition in the poetry or political
world. Oppositional politics must be exposed as an expression of
misplaced psychology. We are wasting our time as on religion if we
persist in trying to universalize our morality about how good we are if
we don't "dirty" our hands.

The avant-garde is bound to fall faster than the main body of troops.
They are the quickest ears and eyes, but they are alone in enemy

To Robert Drake's note, YES, political influence is easier than we think.
Think 10 letters influenced a vote. Democracy is about institutions that
can carry multiple individuals. We need more than individuals, we need
society to operate. Reducing reality to a war of individual points of
view supports the right. Maggie Thatcher said, "There is not society,
only individuals." The state directly controlling each individual is now
a real possibility. We need our institutions to increase the masses mass.
Apologies for the polemics, but...

Jeffrey Timmons writes, "I would
like to join my name (for what its worth) to a list of creative persons,
academic sorts, who recognize the need to speak collectively about this
situation in order to draw attention to it." I think a lot of our
legislators would rather hear from a bunch of single constitutents rather
than a list of creative, academic sorts. Both actions are worthwhile, but
don't not do the single voice writing or calling. I know from experience
that senators & congresspeople (& it's most important to call your local
ones, for whom you are the constituent) actually do count calls & letters
& keep tabs & sometimes (no, not always) it's those numbers that sway
their vote or can even make them speak on the floor. That's why Working
Assets giving free phone calls to them actually can help, Tenney. I know
it all sounds too simple, but my goodness, let's not look for reasons not
to call or write such people. They need to know that there's a radical
mainstream experimental poetics group which cares about Bosnia, too.

X-cc:         rsillima@vanstar.com

There have been more thoughtful, interesting messages on the list in the
past 48 hours than any person could ever respond to, but here are a few
thoughts in a strictly reactive mode:

It was great to hear Marjorie praise Kat Lindeberg's Balkan reading list
while getting a (yet another) dig in at Marxism, given that the sources
in KB's bibliography show a decided bent toward what I'd (very
loosely) call the post-Trotskyist tradition (Against the Current, New
Left Review). Excellent publications both (tho my two eye operations
have really made NLR's 8 point type a chore the past few years, so I'm
not as rigorous a reader as I once was there). As a fellow traveler of
the post-Trots, I've always thought that their critique of Stalinism set
them up to survive the collapse thereof with the least self-doubt. And
generally it's been true, even in the former Soviet Union where Boris
Kagarlitsky got elected to the Moscow city council.

But Marjorie is right in her assertion that the National question is the
most pressing (and depressing) issue facing us at this moment. Robert
Schaeffer (onetime editor of Nuclear Times, now at San Jose State I
believe) wrote a book that I read in manuscript back in the mid-80s on
self-determination (a concept "discovered" more or less simultaneously
by Lenin & Woodrow Wilson, both for tactical [if not overtly
opportunistic] grounds--partition, with all its consequences, has been a
major political tool ever since. One of the proponents for Prop 187 here
in California (our own modest attempt at "ethnic cleansing") made an
interesting comment on the radio the other day that "without borders,
we'd be nothing, just an amorphous blob." That resonates so clearly with
all the rhetoric of identity politics from the past 15 years as to turn
my stomach. (Identity politics, Marjorie, IS vulger Marxism at its
worst. Its characteristic chant--"the people united"--is ironic without
self-knowledge. And it has been the disaster that the left in the US has
not understood how to handle, guilt-ridden honkies that we are.)

On the contrast between working for a burger joint and a university for
intellectual freedom: if Davidson & Gelpi calling three brands of
academic verse the "major trad. of the 1970s and '80s" isn't an instance
of "thinking the boss's thought" I don't know what is. Does nobody
out there have horror stories about the constraints placed on their work
for orals or the dissertation? The sole difference might be that the
burger worker is less apt to CARE about the subject for which his/her
brain is being retooled. (Steve Farmer might well disagree with this,
but then Steve doesn't cook for burger joints.)

Working in corporations has certainly deepened my understanding
of/commitment to a Marxian (as distinct from Marxist) discourse. The
entire high tech industry is driven wildly by perceptions of the falling
rate of profit (watch printer prices in 1995, or PC prices in the next 3
months--those are going to throw people out of work) and Kondratieff
waves and social structures of accumulation are precisely what the
transformation from an industrial to an information services economy is
about.

Bill Gates is still G2, about Ben Friedlander's age, younger than
Michael Basinski if I reckon right. The guy who wrote Mosaic, the
primary internet interface, has just turned 23. And some of the best Web
linkage sites are being done by teenagers. The internet is "always
already" an expression of post-GATT consciousness. The same principle
that puts Tony Green and Wystan Curnow at our fingertips puts Mexican
labor just seconds away. We're taking the touch costs out of more than
just poetry.

The price of influence has gone up from what Luigi-Bob says. When I
worked as a lobbyist in the mid-70s, most legislators in California used
to divide up (literally into shoe boxes) letters on each issue. First
divide was in-district vs. out. Out never got read. Then in-district &
out were counted. A postcard was typically given a weight of 4 (i.e., 4
people would likewise feel strongly in the district for each card) and
letters were given a weight of 7. Every pol knows what their district is
communicating. If you read the disclaimers of the congressional email
project, for example, you will note that the first thing they want to
know is your physical location since, unless you are writing from
something like a school account, they can't tell where you live. Our boy
Newt, former college professor that he is, plans to get all of congress
up on the internet next year. So while I'm totally cynical about
electoral politics (in this "democracy," the equation is really one
dollar one vote), I agree that all forms of participation have some
relative value.

Steve Evans' comments about dirty hands are well taken. Though his are
as covered with blood as mine. I think that there is NO comparison to be
made when it comes to reading about the economy and the behavior of
corporations versus participating on a daily basis, particularly if you
are in a position where you can see both the micro decision-making and
the macro effects. Tom Peters can tell you much more about capitalism
than Andrew Ross, I'm afraid.

There is also real value in participating in a community (as any job
site is) in which the majority of people do NOT presume to be
intellectuals. Where people are at least as apt to read the Koran or the
Bible or the latest Tony Robbins infomercial best-seller on their lunch
breaks as they are cyberpunk or Representations.

The biggest problem with the university is not that it's not full of
interesting, intelligent people, but that it's isolated and insulated --
and has an unbelievably stratified caste system between faculty,
students and staff (hospitals and the military are the closest
approximations to this).

The entire tenure/specialisation process has one thing quite remarkable
about it (that Lyotard only gets half right in his characterization of
paralogy in the PostModern Condition): everybody is perpetually in
competition with one another to differentiate themselves. Cooperation in
too many academic settings occurs ONLY IN COMMITTEES, and we know just
how reviled committee work is. Even in the worst of corporations, there
is a general collaborativeness, whether it is to make the well-wrought
Saturn or to get stock to turn 7 times per year instead of 6 in a widget
store.

Since the late 1960s, the academy has become increasingly an economic
backwater--probably because it once for a moment seemed all too powerful
and present--and I think the whole educational system is heading for a
crash that will make the demise of Texas oil and Pennsylvania steel,
say, look like a picnic. The prominance given to such "academics" as
Gingrich and Gramm (both professors a few years back), Bill Bennett,
John Silber, Lamar Alexander (running for Prez no less), the late Alan
Bloom, the authors of The Bell Curve, Camile Paglia et al suggests a
pretty tawdry state. Lingua Franca makes no pretense about its role as
the National Enquirer of this domain, but the Chronicle of Higher
Education has just figured out a better mode of drag (sort of the
Victoria's Secret to LF's Fredericks of Hollywood).

One can operate oppositionally in ANY of these settings. If one knows
where one is positioned (both personally and institutionally). But I'm
always startled at how clueless many academics seem on that point.

And that's where the national question, which is murderously re-emerging
everywhere, has me wondering tonight. ((This troubles me completely: I'd
use "oppositionality" where others would the avant-garde or
experimentation to identify my own sense of tradition, but that word Op-
Position has exactly that counter thrust of border creation that I find
so suspicious or flagrantly dangerous in every other instance. So I find
myself at the crux of a dilemma. I don't have the answer.))

Re Eric Paper's comments on capital -- it has long been a problem of,
let's call it, chewing-gum Marxism, that it grossly oversimplifies the
notion of capital, which has always had multiple and shifting
referents.  In the mercantilist period it was amazing to some that folks
would think wealth might actually be equated with that stuff, money.  One
feature of the information economy is emergence of new forms of capital
-- intellectual capital, the cultural capital Pape and Bourdieu refer to,
and information capital.   Here poets are rich.  Sandra Braman

George:

I can't say why they snubbed Jung, but I suspect it had less to do
with international politics than with psychoanalytic politics. Their
devotion to Freud was intense and personal. And they perceived
the psychoanalytic movement, as it was called, as bearing the same
kind of millennial burden someone now might attribute to something
called, say, post-Trotkyism.

It's strange because in some ways H.D.'s thinking, anyway, is finally
closer in many ways to Jung's than Freud's. And H.D. always perceived
her self as heretical. Still, Jung was the bad son of The Master they
loved.

But this, of course, is all speculation. It may be somewhere in the
correspondence, but I haven't seen it.

Dear Charles B:

That's quite a list of experiments! It reminds me of Kenneth Koch's
techniques for eliciting poems from kids in school workshops, though
obviously more extenisve and geared toward technical issues. I guess
I always had a bit of a problem with the "put a different color in every
line" school of writing when I was doing workshops. While the results
are spectacular in some sense, my own sense of what writing could do
for the kids in that situation was somewhat different. That is, rather
than focussing on language as medium and its extraordinary
possibilities, I always felt more attracted to the problems of
articulation and choice in relation to the kids' lives.

I remember a 5th grader in a class at School 4 in Buffalo (that's in the
middle of the Perry Projects on the upper south side) coming up to me
after my rap to them that they *were* poetry, that poetry was their
lives if only they could find the words they needed, that every detail
of their lives was suitable for this language. He was defiant, and smart
assed, and said with a sneer that he was going to write a poem about
hanging in the park listening to Niggers with Attitude, expecting me to
draw some line. Which I didn't. So he actually had to think about it and
write it. It wasn't bad, either. He decided finally, on his own, for
reasons he never explained to me, to change Niggers with Attitude to
NWA. For better or for worse, it was a choice, one that to me with my
somewhat antiquated views on poetry seems somehow more significant
than whether to put red or green in a particular line. Ditto with the
6th grade kid at Red Jacket Academy who wrote about "Old men with big
20 gallon / bottles of E & J or Easy Jesus / wearing big clunk master
boots / with no toe." (Jeez, I love that) And a hundred others I could
quote.

It always seemed to me in those situations that the kids had so much to
gain from poetry. Call it the world. Or a world, anyway. An entrance.
Maybe that's partly why I feel the way I do about "experimentalism",
that it seems to me to step around those difficulties in favor of some
other, more formal ones.

Best,
Mike

be able to have his didactic cake and eat it to, as it were--a chaser, etc...
And so I brought this up to my class, and a student (one who loved Silliman's

Yes, perhaps, but doesn't Gringrich's, Gramm's, Paglia's, et al's,
prominence and presence in popular/political culture suggest the vital
interrelation (largely in a sense that is disturbing to me, being as
their politics are detestable) of academia and the rest of the world?  I
don't disagree that the university is in trouble, but it's because
education as other than vocational training is highly unpopular not only
with students but the those that pay for education at the state/federal
levels.  What place is there for art if education is meant to "train" the
student a job?  The place such "academics" as Newt et al is precisely an
indication of the power and ability (used regressively) such institutions
still manifest in the "isolated" and "insulated" "backwater" status.  I
largely agree with Ron's comments, but somehow his comments about
academia remind me too much of the Republicans attacks on the
"establishment" of Washington DC--an  establishment and set of practices
they are very much a part of--particularly as they portray it as
something "out of touch" with the rest of America.  I don't want to speak
for anyone besides myself, but I am not simply an academic.  I play many
roles in my own life and act in many different dramas--all of which
connect me to the rest of the world.  My "academic" role is vitally
connected to my other roles, particularly my role as a citizen, a member
of the polis.  Yes, our roles are increasingly isolated, but academics
are neither more nor less isolated or "redundant" than any other
"occupation."  Maybe even less so.  All I want to claim is that while all
"occupations" compel one to think for them at least . . . I experience my
own sense of being able to set the agenda more for myself here than
anywhere I have hitherto worked.

"Thugs" are those that sit on hills above a city and shell children
playing soccer, turning the field into a cemetary; "Thugs" are those that
refuse UN safe passage to isolated area in order to feed people unable to
gather food because of a war; "Thugs" are those that kidnap UN troops as
"insurance" against NATO bombings; "Thugs" are those snipers who
patiently wait for 11-year-olds to cross their paths.  You know them, I
know them, is there really any need to clarify this?

Yo, vulgar marxism is a model of the relations between the base and
superstructure where the economic base determines the superstructure.
It's a model marxists have come to distrust for a number of
reasons--largely because it is too deterministic and reductive of the
complexity of systems of production at present.  Any other questions?

Oh, I almost forgot: following up on my comments on the prominence of
academics in the national spotlight, did anyone see Camille Paglia on the
Conan O'brian show last night?  I only caught the end of it, where she
was saying that strip clubs were pagan shrines for the worship of the
female form--O'brian thought that worth paying homage to (I disagree,
with both him and Paglia).  I have other thoughts about how these
rather reacationary/conservative critics/academics are getting so much
press recently--how it's connected to the Republican "landslide" (as
if)--but I have to dash off to "work" now so. . . .  But hey Harold
Bloom's new book--Paglia his student!--seems even part of this movement
of "tradition" and canon that is synonomous with  the Republican values
being promulgated as of late.  Did you see how much coverage he got?
Time, Newsweek, NYT Review of Books (I think it was that one, or
another).  Geez, as if he were insulated from what is going on in the world!

Point taken.  But I think in general I'd still agree w the Baudrillard
point: that any time your opinion is solicited, esp. around a yes/no
toggle, it's very likely that the question has been formulated in such a
way as to make the effects of the "answer" not very efficacious (and
also: that the questions tend to get formulated or re-formulated in such
a way as to distribute the answers toward 50/50: a great centralizing and
inertia-producing mechanism): or: is there "more" or "less" "public
opinion" in the polling era than in the pre-polling era?  Or as Prodigy
likes to put it: "Is O.J. Guilty?  YOUR VIEWS" (which gets you to a
screen in which you toggle yes/no to a lot of prepared pollster
questions).  WHich doesn't mean I don't vote or don't phone "my"
congressperson.

Yes.  It was (mebbe still is somewhere & for some bodies) a
collection of attitudes, a subculture, a community--not so very
different from what "this" is.  Songs like the Dead Kennedy's
"Winnebago Warrior" or Black Flag's "TV Party" offered, believe
it or not, trenchant (and amusing) critiques of  media, consumer
culture, & ecotyranny before i got around to Benjamin,
Baudrillard etc.  The "zines" sold outside punk clubs were my
first exposure to do-it-yourself "alternative press"
publications, wherein kids (somtimes as young as 10 or 11 as i
recall) tried their hand at reviewing records and concerts for
themselves, casting their thoughts into editorials on serious
political & moral issues, drawing comix, "networking" etc.  In
fact, the do-it-yourself ethic (something cultivated on this
list?) was one of punk's strongest appeals--breaking down the
boundaries between audience and performer (as the mosh pit
encroached on the stage) etc. etc.  I cld go on about its meaning
as a "social formation" in my life, at a time when it looked as
if the world wld blow itself to bits any day, but I'll stop here
for now...

 Did it escape commodification as "entertainment"?  Not by a long
 shot--and that process, as other G1-ers (erk, i really hate that
 appellation) here have suggested, was sometimes a painful and
 disillusioning one.  Even so, it didn't erase the other things
 that punk was.  Is jazz anything other than "entertainment"?  How
 about poetry?

I welcome Charles Bernstein's long long list.  Many of these are
familiar.  I could add a few to that, combining translation and
dice-driven letter group changes etc.  the use of only symmetrical
capital letters for every word of a text.....

I've been reading The Best of George Gershwin.  And Alvy in Woody
Allen's Manhattan invited to go see some Sol Le Witt's replies " Yes,
that would be fun".  And, for a whole lot of other reasons too, there is
one little point that needs making.  Writing poems is easy, as we all
know.  Writing poems that we woiuld have others hear, as we would
read them off our bit of paper at a lectern, or in the street, (as Ron
has, as I have too) or recite in a crowded room on some
occasion, and then think of there being others who might read them
or recite them, is to turn from the Writing Room (Scene 1) to the
Pub(L)ic arena (Scene 2) and there is immediately not only a
{POLI-TICS} but    an EROTICS.

Questions?

"They're writing songs of love, but not for me...."

If PLEASURE of the Tongue and of the Ear and of the tickled Brain is not
forthcoming, who'd dream of listening to poetry ever again, (or read it).
The only claim of poetry on the others around the poet is that it gives
a variety of pleasures.   It MAY  --  WELL --  (well?)  -- BE the CASE thAT
marginalization has occurred not strategically or tactically but by
ignoring this simple enough sounding "fact".

Writing poems is necessary because last week's poems no longer
satisfy the poet.  Last month's may still satisfy the poet's friends.  (But
why aren't the Gershwin brothers anthologized?)

What is this "compradore" poetry of Ron Silliman's?

Why is seriouu poetry not supposed to take place in cabaret, only in
class-rooms?   It doesn't make much odds what humanitarian
causes poetry advertises.  It's the whole jingle inserted into the
political jungle of publication (printed, electronic or "sung" aloud) that
works an effect on people (e.g. indifference, tomato-throwing, jeers or
cheers).

I strongly recommend in the light of all this that poets get back to
business.   If, as seems to be the case that we are enclosed
hopelessly (oy weh!) in a Social that is Show-Biz (! I like that ?)
Show-Biz is necessarily the only way to go,  but  poetry  can need  it's
own spaces, e.g.St Mark's may be, Ear Inn, as well as get out into more
Public Spaces, owned and operated by others etc.    It's not fame or
money, but the honour of the practice of this amazing craft, that is
motive.

(Motive enough!)

Doing poetry in public is highly political.  There are splendid models
available in the fifties and sixties for vigorous performance and writing
in public spaces.  Then "daring" to say what goes unsaid, out
of pressure of business corporations or educational corporations (oops,
sorry, I mean universities in their current state forms), is what counts,
and there those who are well-versed in researches into what really
happens in Bosnia etc can do their thing, like crazy.

As for intervention, Wystan Curnow and Alan Loney and I, armed with
slug-guns only are off to make peace in Bosnia to-morrow.  It's really
so simple, after all we're Kiwi Kids, we can do it....(Wystan and Alan
don't know this yet).

Re Ron's lengthy and gestural response I have much agreement but a couple
of concerns that concern us as poets. If Ron is worried that the
University is too isolated, how can we view the poetry community. At the
University you have to negotiate between administration, staff, teaching
staff and the students. In the poetry world we can't even agree among a
group of people who by virtue of common interests and experience in their
"chosen" endeavor should by all rights agree.

But we don't. I would attribute the issues in the poetry community to
our ideas. Not that they are good or bad, but that if the most of the
world treat property as value, we treat ideas as value and as such hoard
them as surely as the miser hoardes gold and claim them as ours and if a
difference of a word or two crops up, create a stink that would clear out
the skunk farm. Distinctions, differences, adjustments to distinctions.
Where's the beef and Marjorie might say...

Second, the use value of Marxisms being in doubt right now, we have a
chance to carve out some relationships between its dualisms and the three
pronged arguments about ecology and the four sided arguments about
personalities and the five sided discussion in the systems universe about
types of social groupings until we were blue in the face.

We do seem to be in agreement that nation states hardly exist as other
than coffers of resources for transnationals. The refusal of the left to
support a nation state in the Prop 187 argument is proof that we are
internationalists regardless who is running the show. One species on the
planet and eventually one set of leadership.  It is up to each of us to
contribute to the fact of internationalism in our own way. I for one am
interested in shaping it rather than resisting a faite accompli.

From: UB Poetics discussion group
Some scattered thoughts are streaming after the following:

MERZ.  Some advantages of working in the rough & tumble business world
 -- a more cooperative model for getting work done, greater diversity in the
working population, and a compelling sense of making it up as you go along
(i.e., that which is being TstudiedU is identical to that which is
Tbeing madeU). Plus thereUs a lot of great non-poetic material out here,
which as we know is good tonic for reviving boring old literature.  This
is not career counseling.

IDs.  I agree with Rodger that much of the discussion of politics and group
identity seems motivated more by a desire for positive self-identity and
recognition than for political efficacy.

.EDU/.COM.  I wonder if there isnUt a kind of town & gown psychology at
play in speculation about the life of poetry inside & outside academia.
Now that more and more of us .com guys are joining yUall .edu guys on
the Net, I wonder how thingsUll change.  At least itUs a way to talk over
quadrangle walls.  I donUt know how long IUll be able to deal with all these
messages though -- just reading Uem -- (my time is billable).

PUNK.  The point of punk was that these people said fuck you to the established
commercial channels, creating their own scenes, producing
on their own labels, etc.  It was entertainment, sure, and never really
threatened the power, I agree, but at least it had some energy.  Of course,
punk was tailor-made for recuperation (see Malcolm McClaren).  Hip hop is
a similar case in point.  The point is local (in the current instance,
multi-local) self-regulated activity may have half a chance to produce
more than more of the same.

EXPERIMENTS.  From my teaching days, IUd agree with Michael Boughn
that the value of form lies as a tool to tap into content.  I used to propose a
formal exercise linked to an sample text then let the students run with it. The
payoff was not in the skillful manipulation of form but in how
the forms enabled the students to access areas of content that were
meaningful to them -- much more so, I believe, than if they had been
assigned to write RaboutS specific subjects, their feelings, etc.

It has taken me a couple of hours to read (at least partly) the
extraordinary number of contributions to this list which have
arrived in cyberlitterland over the last couple of days. My
survival, i.e. time enough to pay the bills and make money enough
to do so, depends on you cutting it out.

1. For 5 years during WWII neither the English nor any other
allied power laid an intentional single bomb across the railroad
tracks that led how many thousands of jews gypsies gay people
per day? to doom. Does this make them thugs?

2. I was a grad student for 6 years, have taught in 3 universities,
have worked for large corporations, as well as quasi-gov'tal
organizations, and have written and lived poetry off and on all
my life. Without question, and by metaphorical orders of magnitude,
the most serializing, cutthroat, thoughtless and non-oppositional
(i.e. slavish) environment I ever lived in was the academy. Lagging
far behind is the world of poetry, although as poets move into the
academy some of them unveil an extraordinary capacity to take on
that local color (and others, on the other hand, retain the
exceptional generosity of nature and act that will make you know
whom I mean *not* to be commenting on). There is a strong sense
of comradeship among poets somehow, at least I have always noted
it, which mediates if not moderates the lust for... any response
honor position the opportunity to make a living by your wit of
words, whatever. This comradeship I think it is which allows a
poet like Henry Taylor to write so meaningly about Jackson Maclow,
and which allows me to enjoy getting to know HT despite thezero
in common of our work. Much more open, all the same, much more
egalitarian, much more permissive of range has been the world
of commerce. I remember how shocking, and somehow wrong, I found
that fact.

3. The above is what James Sherry might call a "theory based on
memory... not analysis" (that's a paraphrase rather than a quote,
but close I think). All theories are of memory (a term whichwe
need not trivialize) and on the other hand, analysis (despite
the brilliant series of posts by James which had me gasping with
pleasure to keep up with) is a meaningless term, an honorific
in any case, and a metaphor (understand by dividing : divide and
conquer, really) of little application. Recursive systems (i.e.
memory-based and developmental in whatever chaotic way) offer
the ability to accumulate insight at some social level; they are
what can get us beyond MThatcher's "no society, just individuals"
position.

4. What I say in point 3 is intended to make you understand that
what I say in point 2 is true.

5. I've been fired from positions both academic and in commerce,
in both cases (repeatedly, by the way) for the same reason, for
having an idea. In commerce, at least usually, it was because the
idea didn't work. In the academy? Just for having an idea.

6. When I quoted Hugh of St. Victor on exile, it was not so that
you (dear reader) should have your consciousness perfected by
the right position, but that you might take in and "experimentally"
share a response. Again, the goal is to accumulate and distribute
some largest possible sense of human response. Nothing is more
foolish than to spend one's days distinguishing between on the one
hand vulgar marxism and on the other hand a marxism appropriate to
the changes in the organization of capitol. None of us can know
at all what the structure of capitol is. For one thing we are part
ofit, for another only a bounded thing can be "analyzed" (but, see
above), and it is not that. And, finally, why do we wish to constrain
the mind to appropriate response, when it is the mind that makes
that world of capitol. Make something else.

7. I now work for myself. That's what I learned. If anyone would
pay me, I'd teach for myself (I do seem to know a great deal; drop
over some time - you probably know a lot too), but they don't so
instead packet filtering routers, virtual circuits, negotiation,
managing payables and receivables, closing complex deals, usw. are
my daily fun, and I do mean that. They call for no analysis. James,
at least so I think, knows about such devices too. Having known
each other for going on 2 decades, you might wonder why we've never
worked together.

8. Grad student, quit school. But, I can't tell whether Steve Evans
or Patrick Phillips or Jeffery Timmons or Eric Pape or others (very
few women, very little evidence of a point of view of color, very
little sense of a specifically Jewish pov, very little in any sense
specific to anything whatever, informed by anything not on the other
guy, yeh guy's reading list. If you are on faculties, quit. Anyway,
Ron's right; your industry is heading for a collapse, it has lost
all justification.

9. Paul Hoover's position is overwhelmingly informed by work he has
done to know, accept and make use of his own sources. Ditto Ron
Silliman. These positions are without irony, unhidden in trashy
even disgraceful joking that there is no relationship between your
person and your position, as if these were different in some principled
way.

10. We all have a responsibility, a political responsibility, to
make something (dare I use the word?) positive, i.e. existent and
contributory to the larger thing which is merely the contributory
nature of all that is positive. This means pleasure in writing
and a sense of the permission of form beyond theory as the only
real contact we have with the unknown, i.e. with value. As above,
this is a recursive procedure; it can be justified by nothing
outside it. Without being local (i.e. Serbian or Croatian : bonnet
blanc, blanc bonnet), it is endlessly specific. Attending to it
is a discovery, uncovering, of more specificity.

11. Oh. In 8 above, you may think I'm being dismissive. Or glib,
in advising you to quit. You have families, you have to have a
job. Sure, no problem. Nor do I take the Platonic position that
a slave is one by nature or essence : if not, he'd be dead. After
all, I was fired, I wasn't offed! I prefer the Jewish position,
be kind to the slave. In the jubilee year, free all the slaves
(what the heck, most of them will enslave themselves again).
(of course, that's only one of the jewish positions, i.e.
positions in the rabbinic tradition - which is always what *I*
mean by the term "jewish").

12. I knew a poet once who was quite wealthy - by marriage. He
lived well, by which I mean in a bohemian manner and much like
the rest of us, all young enough (tho some older than others)
not really to notice, to accumulate, difference from where it
sprung. In any case, this poet didn't need a job. Yet, a time
came when the poet wanted to work. The poet once asked me for
a job, but I didn't have one to offer. Some years later, the
poet decided to enter grad school, got a Phd somewhere in the
humanities, and then got a teaching job and began to live
very differently from how we had all lived -- in any case,
we were all living differently, having gotten older, and that
was no surprise. The poet's poetry hardly changed at all.

13. Because of what I say in 11, that is why I have written
mildly and without wishing to give offense. It is a subject,
what responsibility is taken not to articulate a position
correctly but to live a worthwhile life. Don't you think it
idiotic to imagine that the conditions no longer inhere for
that possibility?

14. There is no such thing as silent prayer. "Oh Lord, bring
the arrogant kingdom to an end, speedily and in our days."
Anybody know the reference?

From:         "Donald J. Byrd" <djb85@CSC.ALBANY.EDU>
Subject:      Experiments

        Dear Charles--

        I suppose you in part posted the list of experiments as an
homage to Bernadette, and of course I wish her well.... And it
is also a tribute to Tzara, Cage, and  Mac Low, all of whom I
would likewise honor.

         Although, as you know, I sometimes--perhaps often-- do
not agree with you, I take your work very seriously. I find most
of your moves in relation to the art generative--decisively so.
And I have attempted to understand why you introduce these
"experiments" in the context of your of your proposal of poetry
as experimentation.

        The use of that kind of experiment, when it was of use,
was to rend the placid, rational surface of smug and placid
rationalism.  There was a powerful, even controlling
assurance, that the world made sense.  One half of Modernism
was commitment to the revelation of precisely that sense--
Yeats, Pound, Joyce, Shoenberg, Anglo-American philosophy
from Russell and Wittgenstein to Quine and the Cognitive
Scientists.  It is sadly reduced but the drivel that comes from
most Creative Writing programs to this day still basks in that
now grim assurance that because I saw a blue jay on a maple
branch take a shit, it most have some true and important
connection to my thought of mortality.

        The irruption of the irrational and its disruption of that
smug sense of the world--whether from the Dadaist/surrealist
algorithms of non-sense or from the failure to make it cohere
by the like of Pound--  was immensely satisfying and, of course,
immensely productive.

        The mode of production that had proven so successful in
art was adapted in the 1950's  also to commercial production.
The rational machine of the capitalist economy began
exploiting its own material unconscious, thus, fueling
unparalleled economic growth.   The surface of the earth was
increasingly covered with the chaotic residue of riotous
production: the production of art, the production of consumer
goods, the production of by-products that polluted the
environment, the production of what Smithson called "the
slurbs"P"a circular gulf between city and countryPa place
where buildings seem to sink away from one's visionP
buildings fall back into sprawling babels or limbos. Every site
glides away toward absence.  An immense negative entity of
formlessness displaces the center which is the city and the
swamps."

        For the generation of artists born of the World War II--
"born dead," Smithson says of them,  everything they'd learned
was wrong.  The techniques of the artists who had interested
them in art in the first place, whom they had admired and
thought to imitate, turned out to be inappropriate to this new
condition. Dadaism lives:  it is taught at in the Harvard M.B.A.
program. Surrealism lives: it  is taught to computer
programmers at M.I.T. (some might say, mathematics has
proven so strange, that it is taught even in the math
department).  Our architects, our lawyers are modernist
purveyors of chaos (to say nothing, of course, of the faceless
committees which generate what we call the media).  After a
certain point, chaos no longer needed the help of art. To recall
wild nature in tranquility, to practice nihilistic techniques of
art and thought, to do automatic writing, or to create chance
generated art is a pointless gesture.    The techniques that
delivered fresh air in 1810 or 1910 contributed (though
contributed insignificantly) by 1970  to a proliferation of
incomprehensible energy.  The Dadaists never managed to
exhibit the degree of chaos that Smithson records in his snap
shots of Passaic, New Jersey.

        It seems to me that these experiments at this late date
call us back to means that are as exhausted as the means of a
poetry that still attempts to make "ordinary" sense of a world
where one watch a blue jay crap and thinks of mortality or
Aunt Minnie.

        If we are going to experiment, let us experiment with all
seriousness.  Stephen Hawking concludes _A Brief History of
Time_ with these words:

"... if we do discover a complete theory, it should be
understandable in broad outline by everyone, not just a few
scientists.  Then we shall  all, philosophers, scientists, and
just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the
question of why it is that we and the universe exist.  If we find
the  answer to that , it would be the ultimate triumph of
human reason--for then we would know the mind of God."

        To be sure,  there is something very slippery in Hawking
and those who make similar arguments (this guy Frank J.
Tippet who has a very popular reading of physics right now is
a real hoot) in that they confuse their representations for the
world (as many writers make the opposite mistake).  But I
cannot help but notice the disparity between Hawking's hoped
for result and the hoped for results in doing cut-ups of _Being
and Time_ and _The National Enquirer_.

        It seems to me that if poetry is going to be taken
seriously, it is going to have to ask more of itself.  I would
suggest that we take Parmenides,  Lucretius, and Blake--Blake
the thinker-- as our models.  It is going to be tough to teach the
Workshop to do that, and we do not have much time, but we
have time for nothing less. If no one writes a poem for fifty
years that is okay.  There was plenty of pass-times.

        I do not mean that we can write _like_ Parmenides,
Lucretius, and Blake, but we might undertake the task of
producing a world that offer the commodious possibilities for
knowledge that theirs do.

        The notion of avant-gardism and avant-garde
experimentalism are profoundly progressivist.  Even as the
avant-guardists explored the most primitive recesses of culture
and mythology, or the depths of dream and intoxication,
systematic or random disorganization, the orientation was
toward an expansion of consciousness into the unknown.  The
avant-gardists were the imperialists of the spirit,  brothers and
sisters to the colonists.  The parallels between Walt Whitman's
adventures into the soul and the United States adventures on
its passage to India cannot be dismissed. Just as the
modernists travelled along with the colonizing
anthropologoists. It  is not for us now a matter of judgement.
The time is long passed, and we can say only that that
something, which had been lurking in human possibilities,
hidden, made itself powerfully manifest: it was beautiful,
unjust, vicious, and inevitable, and now complete.  One cannot
imagine the usefulness of such a concept in a world devoted to
sustainable uses of resources.

        The best assessments of the ecological damage are
produced by different models and do not give consistent results.
It would seem that after this extended period of cultural
sacrifice for the sake of developing representational techniques
that are accurate and complete it should be possible to model
the world environment with considerable accuracy.  The
various representations, however, give a remarkable range of
results, and we do not have a science for determining which
representation is the best.  We have theories and theories of
theories, but in this most significant of matters, where the
stakes are all or nothing, we do not know any thing for certain.
It is generally clear, however, that the present industrial-
environmental practices cannot be continued indefinitely
without causing irreversible damage to the world ecosystem.
In 1990, the well respected World Watch Foundation estimated
that present trends would cause irreparable damage in forty
years. Even if we have five times that long we are already in
the crisis.

        Certain aspects of desire were regimented (often at great
personal cost) in the service of an organization devoted to
greed. Communism proposes a greater justice in dividing up
the booty, but it too is profoundly progressivist.  What was
repressed and is still effectively repressed is in fact obvious: the
finitude of the earth.

        For a very long time in the West we tried to base
knowledge on the notion of infinitude.  The critique of that
notion has left art almost totally befuddled and trivial.

        Let us begin with the finitude of the earth.  This seems
fairly secure knowledge, the grounds for a new epos.   Over a
century ago, John Ruskin wrote:

        "The real science of political economy, which has yet to
be distinguished form the bastard science, as medicine from
witchcraft, and astronomy from astrology, is that which
teaches nations to desire and labor for the things that lead to
life, and which teaches them to scorn and destroy the things
that lead to destruction."

        How, Charles, do we get it all out of the poetry
workshops?

        Best,

        Don Byrd

I shall gather materials for those interested, re:  Bosnia Herzegovina
group in London, New York . Etc.  This will take me a day,since my
books are with my addresses in an office I can't reach at the moment.
Let me just say, though, that Civil War is a LOADED term.  The war,
acknowledged by all and espcially by the UN even in the first phases
of the war, which meant in Croatia and even Slovenia, was a war of
aggression.  After all, though Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia
seceeded (also a complex story) from the Yugoslav Federation, Serbia,
principal in the JNA (Yugo. National Army) had vitually all the
military bases and weapons.  Anyway, there is a great deal of
information and misinformation to dig through.  This is hard stuff, but
difficulties of communication and accurate political assessment should
not keep us/one from venturing forth, at least as far as trying to
get a fix on part of a whole scary kindling to another ethnonationalist
conflagration.

More to follow, but meanwhile. . .
It does help to contact legislators individually; it also helps to
contact "contact groups" and the representatives of govt's of former
Yugoslavia.  There are Bosnian missions and Croatian embassies in several
cities; New York being principal here as always.

As I mentioned, I shall get useful information to those interested.
I am sorry that it might be a few days, but I am tripping through
a very complex moment in my life.  TRIPPING in the sense of falling
and catching my step, not in what is now a very old San Francisco
acid sense.

I do think that it behooves poets and philosophers (funny work,that last)
to (seek to) address THE WORLD, from which there is no escape, anyway.
Discussions of Marxism, as much as they escape concern over academic
or p.r. capital, are most important.  However, given the complex
investments, both utopian and intellectual, in Tito's Yugoslavia,
ironies abound if one attempts to reconcile such discussions with the war.

James Sherry's observations about the cost of war profiteering and
the skewed and screwed hopes of the young men and the very old men
(in Serbia, Croatia, all over the former USSR) are quite to the point.
Once again, after all the World War(s) and hot little distractions
in outposts of various empires, war is the bloody displacement of desire,
the means by which a few extract too much from so many.  It's an
ugly scene over there; nearly as simple as thugs with no power feeling
the illusory power of being able to sign on to consumerism, the perfume,
as Duchamp might say, of the atalier, no, as Marinetti would say the
abattoirs.  That is no thin line.

Dear SHS,

Thanks for the good words on Punk. I didnt pay much attention to it,
though my great friend Greg Curnoe did seriously. I suppose that the
whole ethos and maybe the words in (smudgy) print were interesting,
and oppositional in a useful way. I dont know. I understood what they

But really, I didnt want to listen to a song twice.

"Thug" is derived from "thag," a Hindi word for cheat or swindler
and was introduced into English in the 17th Century to refer to the
*p'hansigar* -- professional robbers who strangled their victims, an
enterprise known as "thugee."

It was adapted in the 19th century to refer to any form of organized
domestic terrorism, from street gangs to "electoral thugs" who kept
people from voting (or voting 'the wrong way'). Earliest uses in the OED
suggest that the shift came when referring to Scots as thugs.

Thus the term as we know and use it is heavily tinged with the stigma of
the Other (thugs are darker than "us") and coded with the practices of
colonialism. It was British laws against the "race" of the Irish that
were first imitated in setting up the laws of segregation in the USA.

There is a certain irony to its use in this discourse. The Serb
governments (plural: Serbian Bosnia is not identical to "greater" Serbia
as a political entity) are certainly fascist: using nationalism as an
excuse and genocide as a practice to create a military state with an
internally capitalist economy. This doesn't make saints out of either
the Croats or the Muslim community of Bosnia.

        Since the discussion has lately touched upon issues of
nationalism and the academy (albeit in separate "strands"), I thought I'd
inject some comments about the ways in which the two are intimately
related in the 50th state.  One of the foremost advocates of Hawaiian (as
in the ethnic group, not simply the citizens of the state) sovereignty is
Haunani Kay Trask, head of the Hawaiian Studies department at the
University of Hawaii.  The issue of Hawaiian sovereignty is much at the
forefront of Hawaii politics at present; activists demand everything from
greater self-determination under the current system to complete secession
from the United States.  One group moved onto an Oahu beach for over a
year and raised a large sign declaring the formation of a Hawaiian state;
after much arm-twisting from the state government, which needs to at
least feign sympathy, the protesters were moved into a valley, where they
are at least not seen (from the point of view of the governor, that is).
Trask, who was educated at the University of Wisconsin, is one of the
loudest advocates of sovereignty and one of the most provocative.  She's
recently come out with a book of essays, _From a Native Daughter:
Colonialism & Sovereignty in Hawai'i_, and a book of poems, _Light in the
Crevice Never Seen_, which is remarkable to me for its absolute
conservatism of form and language (though Hawaiian words are sprinkled
throughout).  In one representative passage she points to the university
as a colonial institution (from an essay, that is):

        For Hawaiians, American colonialism has been  a violent
        process: the violence of mass death, the violence of
        American missionizing, the violence of cultural destruction,
        the violence of the American military.  Once the United
        States annexed my homeland, a new kind of violence took
        root: the violence of educational colonialism, where
        foreign haole (foreigners, white people--the two are the
        same!) values replace Native Hawaiian values; where schools,
        like the University of Hawai'i, ridicule Hawaiian culture
        and praise American culture, and where white men assume
        the mantle of authority, deciding what is taught, who
        can teach, even what can be said, written, and published.

Trask has been at the center of a couple of free speech issues in the
last four or five years; most recently, a cartoonist for the student
newspaper took her to task for a poem from her new book, "Racist White
Woman."  The paper was very reluctant to publish her response to him.
Her claim is that the poem is about a specific woman, so that it's not
racist (and one of my students, an African-American, got very upset that
some people have taken the poem personally rather than as a response to
similar feelings that have gone the other way for too long).  My sense is
that Trask meant to evoke such a response ("woman," after all, is generic
as well as specific).  Here's the poem, whose rhetoric is not at all
exceptional:

        I could kick
        your face, puncture
        both eyes.

        You deserve this kind
        of violence.

        No more vicious
        tongues, obscene
        lies.

        Just a knife
        slitting your tight
        little heart

        for all my people
        under your feet

        for all those years
        lived smug and wealthy

        off our land
        parasite arrogant.

        A fist
        in your painted
        mouth, thick

        with money and piety
        and a sworn
        black promise

        to shadow
        your footsteps

        until the hearse
        of violence

        comes home
        to get you.

Now imagine yourselves, if you are white, teaching this poem to a group
of students almost none of whom are white, who've grown up in an
educational system that has persuaded them that mainland values are
better than "local" ones, and who are, therefore, many of them--well, the
word ornery comes to mind.  This past semester as I taught poetry from
Hawaii and the Caribbean, I found myself repeatedly in situations where
the overwhelming emotions of the moment made ordinary, rational, academic
interventions seem fruitless.  And which made my position of authority
problematic, at best, since the students had an emotional investment in
the material that was far greater than mine.  I found that the best, or
only way, to deal with it was to set the students up to debate each
other, rather than to try to guide them somewhere I wanted them to go.

As for the poem, if turnabout is fair play, then where on earth do we go
from here?  This is what bothers me most; what is violence rhetoric in
this case, is actual violence elsewhere.  How can be address the
nationalisms that live among us (including native American
nationalisms)?  How can we balance these against a larger American
self-definition, whatever that may be?  Yes, the world is Gattifying,
becoming more and more international.  But it's also becoming more and
more local.  The idea of the Pacific Rim actually only includes Asia and
America--what happens to the islands in-between, with their
self-definitions at stake?  And how can university professors (my
classroom, at least in this case, WAS the real world) fruitfully
participate in these debates?  These are not rhetorical questions!

The point of my reference to the daily prayer of all jews that
the arrogant kingdom be destroyed (an arrogant kingdom whose

to inform with the evidence of a life practice the repeated
references to the 'known" function of "religious" values/
institutions/practices, which references have about the same
"positive" content as most of the references to what the other
does that live in the posts and "politics" "?" of this list,
i.e. little and that usually to pass along a counter of
agreement, again to make sure everybody is reading the same
reading list, and no new world-facts storm our interpretations.

The point of my reference to the genteel allied practice of
allowing the uninterrupted operation of the great death train
system of the germans, an allowance referred to from time to

solving "the jewish problem" to come post-war and asking whther

as I fail to remember whose post had it, know who is sitting

As a former haole, back on the mainland, I'm shaken (not stirred) by that
poem, Susan, and by your apt portrayal of the classroom context in which
these issues often play themselves out.  I gnawed a similar bone last
semester, trying to choose what Baraka poems (if any) to teach in a
survey course--the Heath conveniently forgets to mention any of his
anti-semetic work, just as it forgets to mention Rukeyser's Jewishness,
or Tillie Lerner Olsen's, raising questions in its own right.

But I digress.

Clearly this is a poem that's meant to make some of its readers buck up,
validated, and others shrink and squirm, red-faced and stung.  I
wonder--is it the sort of poem I'm supposed to give the nod to (include
in classes, etc.) as a gesture of multicultural solidarity, at least until
the guns start firing and the calls for ethnic cleansing begin?
Do I turn away right from the start, on the theory that I and the public
know what every schoolchild learns, and that my family and I might not be
first up against the wall when the revolution came, but we'd be on the
wrong side of history nonetheless?  Is this a case--since Tom Mandel
asked about positionally "Jewish" responses--in which Deut. 23:3 comes
into play:  to let the students hash it out without specifically
addressing its threat to you and connection with all kinds of bad stuff
worldwide falls under the heading of "showing deference to a poor man in
his dispute"?

Questions, questions.  Will muse on this.

I wanted to respond thoughtfully, and I hope I do, to Tom's extremely
thoughtful posting. In many ways, I think he is right; he certainly had
me pegged, but I wonder how much he knows what we (my generation, my class
whatever) out there in the "Real World" have to face.
     Listen, for me, in the placeI grew up, it wasn't a choice between
the academy and Phillip Morris; it was a choice between the academy and
Wal-mart, or if I was lucky, the Borax mines. I'm not trying to say that
my situation was wors than any number of people;in fact I was lucky to have
that choice because if you were Latino where I grew up, it meant digging
ditches for Cal Trans or Mcy Ds. Yes I am white, or, where I grew up, white
trash, where it still means something besides a cookbook deal with
Random House. And yes, my family still lives in a trailer park, still
drinks light beer all night on a sofa in in the front yard, still gets
weekly vists from Child Welfare....
     But you've heard that a hundred times already in mainstream poetry/
fiction. I don't mean to make a big deal with it, because it is not a big
deal in a time when people are shot at on the way to the Circle-K (in Bosnia
or Southcentral), but it perhaps explains whyI decided on the academy.
     The academy been bery bery good to me...
     Because the academy supported me when no one could. Period. Due
to wonderful wealth of the state of California when I was coming up, and
due to fact I was poor enough to be called underprivileged, I never paid
tuition. Got grants and later, in Louisiana, got a GTA.
     I'm not here in the academy because somehow I think I will be engaged
in pure research, pure poetry, pure work for the work's sake. I'm here for
the money, because if someone is willing to give you money to sit around and
think about stuff, I say take it. Because this is the only chance I had.
     In L.A., they were going to give me 6.5 an hour with a BA from a
third rate CSU to work 60 a week. My mother in the local Stop and Go makes
9.25 now. I decided to go back into the academy.
     Listen, it seems to me, and this is as I write this between an incredible
amount of work all due next week, that it is quite easy to criticize the
choices of others when you are comfortable professionally, I mean canonized,
professionally and personally. Many of the things Tom said are perfectly true,
but, I know the Real World. I've seen a good deal of my  family die from it,
toxic poisoning from the Borax, "accidents" at the construction site, and
a shit load of alcohol related diseases. Give me the choice between that and
the academy, and I'll take the academy.Thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.ed

The issue of characterization, calling people thugs or jews or tall, is
difficult to address alone, because one will always come up against an
unanswerable question which is the intention of the speaker. Black kids
call each other nigger and the common wisdom is that they can say it and
non-black people can't. In the movie "Wanderers" I remember a classroom
scene where the teacher tries to list the names kids call each other by
way of teaching them the sticks and stones may break my bones lesson. The
result of the lesson isthat the class falls to real fighting. But later
in the movie when those same kids: black, chinese, italian and jewish are
playing together and are attacked by a nameless hatred of the other
personified by an anglo gang, they unite and defeat the gang, supporting
the sticks and stones point of view. We may characterize, but the
question is does the characterization prevent us from seeing the real
nature of the problem.

When Marjorie calls the serbs thugs, she misses the point of why the
serbs are doing what they are doing. It is not of use to characterize
them and by doing so cloak their intention in their thuggery. Their
intention must be addressed. If we ask them, what do you want and they
say we want the Muslims land. One can say yes or no. To say they are
thugs is to create a conflict that the serbs cannot understand and to put
us in the same position vis a vis our objective and the serbs are vis a
vis their objective. If we say to the serbs, no you cannot have that
land, we must be prepared to act accordingly. If we are not prepared to
act accordingly we are accomplices of the serbs.

Viola Spolin in her book Theater Games I believe is the title suggests a
game where people have conversation without the pronouns, without,
narrative, without description, and without facts. It is a difficult
exercise and suggest we try it before we start attacking or defending the
serbs way of behaving and as it has been suggested worry about how the
Muslims will behave when the Republicans lift the arms embargo and
support the Communist serbs with massive air power. Thugee becomes thug
at the drop of a gat.

As is pointed out it is not an easy question because we cannot easily
discern another's intention and because although we deplore violence we
mostly recognize our right to defend ourselves.

The anti-Islamic issue in European politics plays as much a part as the
serbs activities, but as I have tried to point out with my tale of
visiting serbia, the intention "land" must be addressed directly,
not by characterizing, but by taking certain risks which no one in this
discussion would consider participating in.

Inflammatory rhetoric is most often the province of non-combatants.

        I'm glad to hear from a "former haole," Eric--though isn't that
in a sense part of the problem; can you imagine being a former African
American or former Asian American?  I'm not sure that the kind of
discourse that I quote by Haunani Trask leads _necessarily_ to ethnic
cleansing, though it certainly bears resemblance with the rhetoric _of_
ethnic cleansing.  And that's part of the problem teaching the material;
do you opt with those who suggest that rhetoric is powerful but,
paradoxically, not a call to real action?  Or do you take it as a call to
arms that is intended to include you?  If there's a more moderate
position to take on the question, which I suspect there might be (being a
foolish optimist), will anyone in the heat of the moment actually listen?

        I just attended a lecture by David Lloyd on "nationalisms against
the state."  He talked about the current Irish situation, in which the
Irish (whoever they are) are perhaps trading cultural power for economic
colonization by the new Europe.  The upside of Hawaiian nationalism, so
far, has been the reemergence of Hawaiian culture outside the province of
the tourist industry, which has "preserved" that culture by presenting it
as a self-parody for the consumption of outsiders.  Trask wants Hawaiian
hotel workers to start trashing the hotels; doesn't she face, then, the
increasing poverty of her people for the benefit of re-creating an ethnic
and cultural (in this case the same, I guess) identity?  She wants and
expects culture to do political work, which Lloyd is suggesting may not
be possible in the face of GATT and NAFTA.  Lloyd suggests that local
resistance is possible without the ultimate goal being that of creating a
new state on the example of the old, as he claims happened in Ireland in
the 1920s.  Trask agreed with him on this, which suggests (I hope) that
"ethnic cleansing" may not be the result of resistance.  The violence may
come, instead, from above--as is happening in Russia?  I don't know.

        Some afterthoughts on teaching: in some sense our horror at
Gingrich's being an academic seems beside the point.  At the University of
Hawaii one simply is the representative of the state, the nation, some
sort of American canon.  This implicates you in all sorts of things, no
matter how liberal you are.  Trask is right on this one.  One can (as I
and many of my colleagues do) cede authority in the classroom, present
oneself honestly as a "professor from the mainland with such and such
degrees), and then find that in that absence name-calling begins.  I don't
know, it's a confusing situation to be in.  I suppose in the case of
Baraka, which Eric cites, one needs to present a "fair" cross-section of
his work, and then argue out what is of value, and to whom.  But the
ethical pressures are, in any case, immense, whether one includes or
excludes such material (and several students called me on the fact that
I'd xeroxed her--Trasks's--"racist white woman" poem, but not her
erotically charged celebrations of the land).  At such a point the
instructor's discomfort with authority turns into a kind of nostalgia for
it!  And alternative authorities are created in the classroom, some of them
overt, and some of them subversive, no matter how fair-minded you think
you're being.

        On a more personal note to Eric, I'm a great admirer of your work
on Crane and Gluck, et al.  Glad to hear that you add "haole" to your
credentials . . .

Let me report, for James's benefit, that I did
indeed manage to make myself whole by thinking,
though evidently the effect was temporary and
I again find myself fragmented.  The experience
wasn't as bad as the past two decades of (a)social
thought had lead me to believe--definitely worth
a few blisters.

Irony aside, my header actually refers to some lines from
an early Rosmarie Waldrop poem, "Linear," in
which she speaks of being in history as receiving
"personal blisters from / impersonal burns."  The
particular context in her case, being born into
a Germany already under Nazi control (see *The Hanky
of Pippin's Daughter*).

The most convincing case for action on the Serbian
aggression in Bosnia would be one that showed the
blisters *here* from the burns *there.* The isolationist
line held by our own newly ascendent authoritarians denies
that there are any.  And if you don't think the possibility
of showing those connections involves contesting the
legitimacy of capitalism, you haven't been paying attention
to     how and by whom information is structured in this
country.

Not *vulgar* Marxism then, but *obvious anti-capitalism*
(obvious in Oppen's sense of what you cannot not see) is
what is needed--not as an end, but as a starting point.

And it is needed in every one of the contexts we've seen
discussed in the past week, whether .com or .edu.  What
I wanted to say in response to Ron's initial "Exile on
Main Street Post" was simply that anti-capitalism involves
one in no necessary contradiction in education (necessary
is the operative word here), whereas it most patently does
in the various enterprises that have been named (Deutsche
Bank, Philip Morris, C=O=M=P=U=T=E=R=L=A=N=D, etc.) as
gainful employers. That is, you can universalize education;
you can't universalize capitalism.

(Since each time I say such things, someone insinuates that
the position is criminally naive, can I here request that
any such response take the trouble to explicitly expose the "error
of my ways"?  I am open to instruction, but insinuation
just makes me anxious.)

Two final things: does anyone have word of promising
responses to the latest attempt to eliminate the NEA?
I would be especially interested in hearing about
ways that we can link the inevitable debate about its
preservation to demands that it be made responsive to
the needs of actually existing artists rather than
exquisite careerists.

And, finally, I just wanted to say what a pleasure
the recent weeks' discussions have been--largely because
of all the "new" voices now on the list. Thanks to
everyone for the insights.

                                     NOT!

One need not be a rabid Althusserian to sing a chorus of Ideological
State Apparatuses here. If, as I've been arguing, it's all one system,
the only difference between town and gown is one of position within the
same set, not "inside" vs. "outside" (There is, to repeat myself, no
Out). The sole difference is that one of us is *pretending* that there
is "no necessary contradiction" and one of us is not.

Conversely, capitalism is far more universal than education will ever
be. If by that we mean pervasive, in every object we see. And are.

"Universal" in this culture means a white male who went to one of seven
universities. (Brown, Steve, is one of those universities, even if it's
the low end.) Everyone else is ranked accordingly to how "un-universal"
(and thuglike) we might be.

One of the great things about Hawaii is that the delicacy of that lava
based ecology makes immediately evident how constructed even nature is.
The vegetation came literally in the stomach of birds. And the
commonplace birds of the 1950s are not those of the 1990s. Someone
introduces a mongoose in one century and it becomes the rat, squirrel,
possum, raccoon of the next, having that niche almost to itself. Even
the nene goose, the state bird, is "indigenous" solely because its
off-island origins have been lost. There are only a few hundred of these
left in existance and the only ones I've seen "wild" were in a parking
lot halfway up Haleakala on Maui, begging for handouts from tourists.
Since the arrival of Europeans, everything in Hawaii has come through
the introduction of capital, both American and more recently Japanese.
The Hawaiin guitar came with agricultural workers from Southern
California. The national issues tend to obscure all this, which is what
Lenin thought they were there for.

Like Eric, I believe it was, I come from a white trash California
family, though in a college town (where I am the only member in four
generations to have crossed over the town/gown divide and gone to
school). Which means no doubt that I have a lot of ambivalent (or worse)
feelings about some of these issues. But one illusion I do not carry
about is of the university system as anything other than a state
subsidized process for training workers, without which the corporations
would have to do it directly.

Have we forgotten that all of Chomsky's early grants for linguistics
came directly from the Defense Department?

An earlier generation of linguists was subsidized almost entirely by the
church, in order to translate the Bible into whatever heathen tongue.

"Necessary is the operative word here" indeed.

 My problem with taking the "not a call to real action" route is twofold,
Susan.  First, it seems to me the epitome of privilege, quite smug, in
fact:  it says, in effect, say what you want, we still have the power &
we'll use it, so we're essentially safe & can watch the show.  Second, it
smudges the powerful bonds between this rhetoric and the rhetoric of
ethnic cleansing, et. al., when the only real basis for distinguishing
them seems to me that somehow we know that the writer in question
wouldn't "really" do anything violent.  But, like, is this fair to the
nature of words & their work, their effect on readers, etc?

I was once in a class on African-American lit taught by a professor who
deeply & thoughtfully believed in the therapeutic / pedagogical
expression of anger.  Lots of namecalling by those who were, at last!
authorized to speak their minds--lots of verbal cruelty--lots of tarring
with brushes wide and white, where students responded to what others
hadn't said.  Never a dull moment, and all quite validating, I'm sure, to
those who were in power.  [In power THERE--whatever their lousy status
elsewhere.]

Authority happens.  It feels good to hate.  I think we need to get over
a "discomfort with authority" and focus on just what sorts of authority
we want to dismantle, and what we'll foster in their place.  Culture,
after all, abhors a vaccum.

More to follow, not to the board.

In the Buddhist tradition there's a concept of "right livelihood". It is not
 related to degree of complicity in the economic system, but to the kind of
   consciousness certain occupations create. And in a similar way, I remember
   Robert Duncan, through his contact with Levinas, describing to me the
  Talmudic notion of giving just measure in business transactions because
   it is understood that the just weight and measure is given before
God. He felt that in the same way the poet gives just weight and measure
  when she recognizes that the just weight and measure is not before the
   reader only but a larger totality.
The question is how does the work we do to earn our livelihood
 inform our work as poets? For me, the question was settled accidentally.
  After avoiding steady work as assiduously as possible, I fell into part
 time teaching, accidentally landed a full time job in a community college
and eventually by fluke at a university. For Eric and others for whom these
  decisions are still active, I think it is worth considering the question in
   the "right livelihood' sense-- that is, how can I make my life coherent?
        Ron's assessment of the university as a capitalist training
   center does not speak to my experience as a teacher.

My advice to quit grad school (but I don't think I used the
phrase "drop out" wch he puts in quote -- yet perhaps I did)
seems to have found a tender spot in Steven Shoemaker's mental
anatomy? Does he think I meant it literally? Does he think I
meant it just for him?

Why, specifically why, were my words "self-righteous?"

As to "the academy as a working environment," whatever does that
phrase mean? Does it refer to the ego floating above history
and choosing an environment in which to "work?" Or does it refer
to working conditions in the academic industry?

I guess grad school would be one way to enter "the academy as a
working environment," although it does seem more and more that
it comes to approximate rather a formal training in being
unemployed and even unemployable. Perhaps, too, there are other
ways to reach that goal. Charles Bernstein, whom Steven
invokes against my blanket admonitions, would, alas for Steven's
intentions, find his place on my list: someone who quit - maybe
even dropped out of - grad school!

I don't wnat to be glib; I mean, rather, I'm not being glib, so
I don't want Steven to take me that way. A year or so ago, I
met Reid Whittemore, ex-Library of Congress poet, at a party.
Before he understood that I was Jewish and therefore an exotic
enemy ("Maimonides? Who's that." -- this man is a professor at
U of Md.), he leaned over conspiratorially and whispered "there
are too many poets, if you know what I mean." I was certainly
not meant to understand that there were too many white male
wasp poets (real poets) you may be sure, but that the world
was mispopulated with a rising tide of expression from all the
wrong places. I would not wish Steven Shoemaker to understand
me in this way; I don't want to de-populate the academy (it's
amusing, btw, to affect this god-the-father mode of expression;
as if the academy would fulminate or grow passive depending on
my word).

The narrow reading list of our times is devoted overwhelmingly to
a consideration of the loss of autonomy of the self and its
expressions in speech and thought, the self's explosion or
dissolution. Am I alone in finding the conjunction of this development
in western philosophical/intellectual history curiously aligned
with a moment in which other traditions have arrived on its grounds
to make a claim for such autonomy. A time in which black jew
arab female speak a sophical world of thought which is black jew
arab female? Itis not the "ethnicity" wch interests me in this,
nor the localness (w/ its Heidegerrian and Duns Scotian tone I
find detestable: the value of place, forget it ), but the opposite
its appearance in every case in a foreign place, the insertion
border edge and frontier issues of accountability and recountability
to an other exactly in "place" so that mentally there is no
location that is not on a border, no place that is not also a
leaving that place. That, Steven, is what I meant by telling you,
personally this time, very personally, to quit grad school.

Don't burn the books, just burn the reading list.

        you can't universalize capitalism.

While nodding to his hilarious and brilliantly snide conflation of Computerland
and Language magazine/poetry, I feel obliged to mention that Steve seems to be
using the word "necessary," his "operative word," somewhat unusally. Does he
mean that in the academy it is not "necessary" to notice that you do not have
an anti-capitalixt job but you can hardly escape noticing this fact working at
Deutsche Bank? Well, bully for you herr professor!

Re: "...you can universalize education; you can't universalize capitalism," are
you hiring? Or, less comic, you're wrong Steve. You can particularize
education, you can stratify education, indeed for most people you can eliminate
education. But, "you" can't eliminate capitalism, or, to put the matter
concretely, who is the "you" who can eliminate capitalism?

Please don't assume this as praise of capitalism (I leave that to the opening
pages of the communist manifesto), nor that a hortatory enthusiasm will do in
response to my not-at-all rhetorical question.

This comment doesn't seem right to me.  There IS a difference between me and
the positions I've held in my life.  From construction, to house painting, to
truck driving, to teaching calculus and Pascal programming, to programming a
real time accounting system for Johnson Controls, to painting opera sets, to
whatever.  Isn't this obvious?

As to Paul Hoover's comments on Amiri Baraka getting 5000 for a reading,
seems like sour grapes to me.  Would you, Paul, turn down $5000 for a
reading?  Not that I agree with all of Baraka's politics, I'm definitely
against any kind of racism or ethnocentrism, but, I hope he continues to get
lots of $5000 readings.

I for one don't think working for a corporation provides anyone with any kind
perceptual advantage.  I find it interesting that so much of this discussion
revolves around how we work.  How we make a living seems to me to be related
mostly to our relationship with power.  Maybe there's more to things than
that.

        I'm not sure you can have it both ways, Eric; if the classroom is
to be a place where therapeutic anger authorizes students, then it's
possible to regard Trask's poem as just that: a therapeutic exercise of
getting angry.  Though the word "therapy" suggests that somehow we'll all
work through this in the end.  My problem with equating the poem with
"ethnic cleansing" is that the Hawaiian sovereignty movement is a
separatist movement, not an imperial one (as in the "former
Yugoslavia").  Trask may want more of us haoles (and in this number she'd
include local Asian Americans) to leave the state, but I don't get the
sense that she wants to line us up and shoot us.  In the context of her
entire book, Trask's position is a bit more complicated than this poem
suggests: there's a love poem to her haole partner of many years in
there, too (although he's presented as a "good haole" who supports her
struggle to the utmost).

        A note from yesterday's paper.  "Bumpy" Kanahele, who led the year
long occupation of Makapu'u beach, is quoted as saying that tourism and
sovereignty are not entirely incompatible.  He denied saying that he'd
ever advocated violence against tourists: "What he did mean, he said, was
that if the Hawaiians do not get what they want, things could get violent.
But rather than let that happen, his organization would once again go the
tourists and tell them their presence is lending support to an economy
that is based on an illegal government in land improperly seized from the
Hawaiians" (in 1893).  After independence, and because of it, he argues, a
better grade of tourist will come to Hawaii (an interesting spin on
tourism, certainly).  In an aside, the article reports that The Nation of
Hawaii is hooked into the internet, where they display their flag and
their demands.  A new take on the bumpersticker, Think Local, Act Global
(or is it the other way around?): think net, act internet?

Ron, you are in too much a hurry to dismiss what
I wrote last night.  I said anti-capitalism as
a project does not interfere with any necessary
moment in the educative process. I did not say
that education is not deeply scarred and distorted
within current capitalist conditions.

As for universal = white male Ivy League, please.
You and I can both discern the difference between
false universalism and true universalism.  Brown
is a patently and overtly anti-universalist University.
One of the central campus battles in the years I've
been here has indeed been over its practice of "need-
aware" admission policies.  Though consistently blocked,
this has been a struggle to *universalize* access to
the symbolic and real capital this institution generates.

I have no interest in "pretending" anything.  I, in fact,
don't take this discussion to be primarily or importantly
about myself (though I know what Tom Mandel would say to
that).  I am saying that if "capitalism is more universal
than education ever will be" then all of us are getting
burned.

Knee-jerk anti-unversalism is one of the tiredest tropes of
current (a)social thought.  Try explaining to me an oppositional
position on Bosnia that doesn't involve universalistic claims
of one kind or another.  Try explaining why your position on
identity politics as the real vulgar marxism makes sense without
referring to universalization.  In brief, what ever happened to that
fibonacci series of yours?  Gone with the Laclau-Mouffite wind?

It is fine, though exceedingly abstract, to say there is "no
outside." But at Brown there certainly is (hence an "admission"
process), and where you work also (hence hiring/firing).  And
on a different scale, there is very importantly an "outside"
when it comes to distribution of resources under capitalist
social relations.  Illiteracy is a way of being "outside" the
alphabet; starvation is a way of being "outside" the chi-chi
supermarket.  I'm "in"--I attend Brown (and yes there are people
here--namely all the ones  directly in my "field" in the Eng.Dept.--
who oppose my research and teaching practices), I eat and read,
I'm having a party for other people who also do these things later
tonight.  But I'm under no illusion that cause I'm here, everyone
is.  And I subscribe to the axiom that you cannot intend your
own autonomy without intending that of everyone else (universalization).

Tom, I'm afraid I can't take credit for
the conflation of Computerland/Language:
whoever designed a flier for a DC reading
of Ron, Kit, and Bill Luoma (perhaps Bill
designed it? Or Rod Smith) last year gets
the credit on that one.

Let me assure you, were I hiring I'd try
to tempt you from your current work--with
an emancipation clause in your contract.

The "you who can eliminate capitalism" is
not singular but plural, not pre-existent
but made, not a faded bumper sticker but
a still distant prospect.  Is that too
hortatory and enthusiastic?  It ain't me
alone, and it ain't my "mind" (which had
to undergo a lot of changes in arriving
at this position--very little assisted by
University professors, tho there were *some*)
that's centrally at issue here.

I was struck by the following sentences in
a recently published article by Ernest Mandel.
They perhaps fall in the category of inflam-
matory, of setting the volume too loud for
this particular context and its specific
possibilities.  Mandel says:

Hunger and poverty have risen to the point where
U.N. officials speak about one billion people living
below the poverty line, very conservatively defined.
Sixteen million children die every year from hunger
and curable diseases.  This means that every four
years the same number of children die as the total
number of victims during the whole of World War II,
Auschwitz, Hiroshima, and the Bengal famine included.
Every four years a world war against third world
children: There you have the reality of today's imperialism/
capitalism with all its barbaric implications.

Even with    your antipathy towards Adorno, Tom, wouldn't
you agree that at the very minimum, utopia would
mean an end to such decimation?

Finally, as I mentioned also in my post to Ron, if there
is a moment in the educative process that necessarily en-
tails capitalism, I've not yet heard of it. Learning
pre-existed capital, learning can outlast capital.  In
fact, the only sum larger than the knowledge capital
has accumulated is the sum it has concretely denied.
Poetry is part of the latter sum, which is one of the
reasons this discussion is appropriate on this list.

No Tom, i didn't think you meant the advice to quit grad school
just for me, which helps explain why i liked Eric's reply.  As
for the "tender spot" in my "mental anatomy"--is that what one
needs in order to be, uh, stimulated by your words?  As for why i
thought some of those words were "self-righteous"--I keep
thinking of that corny old joke about how if you "assume" too
much, you make an "ass" of "u" and "me."  Perhaps u didn't mean
your advice "literally"; no doubt i missed levels and levels of
irony.  You also said "your industry is headed for a collapse; it
has lost all justification."  Mebbe that wasn't "literal" either,
but i wanted to indicate my belief that despite its troubled
future, its horrendous contradictions etc., there are still some
good reasons to try to work within the academy.  (That Charles
got there thru a route other than grad school doesn't seem to me
of crucial significance in this (my) context).  And your
argument, Tom, about the "narrow
reading list of our times" doesn't really convince me otherwise.
But if it's a matter of the collapse of inside & outside, of
being in the "place" that is grad school yet also "leaving that
place" at the same time, i think i've pretty much achieved that
conditon already.  But this discussion cld quickly get tedious
(if it hasn't already) for the list, so if you really want, Tom,
to advise me "very personally" then perhaps you shld write me at
ss6r@fermi.clas.virginia.edu.

 As for the "narrow reading list" to which you allude, and its
 relation to the question of what can be said/done in the academy,
 i'm not quite sure i follow the whole of your argument.  But i
 have heard your point about the trend toward "deconstruction"
 coinciding curiously w/ the need for autonomous declarations by
 "other traditions" made many times before, *within*, so to speak,
 the hallowed halls of academe.  Maybe the list and its attendant
 discourse isn't quite so narrow as you think.  And perhaps i
 flatter myself, but i think i've put together some pretty
 interesting reading lists for my classes, lists that have
 included, for example, many people currently participating in
 this "list."  And i've also consistently found that, despite the
 odds against it, some pretty surprising things can happen in the
 classroom--things i haven't seen happen elsewhere very often.
 But more about that another time perhaps.

   steve, just read your new post, i had responded to the earlier one and

   but now I realize that I too misread your statement as claiming that
   academia is "beyond ideology" and am glad to see you are not arguing
   from that position, but what is this "autonomy" we should fight for
   if not the autonomy of "bourgeois individuals"? If capitalism can not

        Ok, one more response to this position and I'm through with the
issue: I won't argue with your experience, Tom, but mine is something
quite different.  Competition is the national ethic, is it any surprise
it exists in the university?  I have friends, peers, partners, and even
those who disagree with me here; I have done creative and innovative work
that has given me great satisfaction as a writer.  That our experiences
don't gib is not cause for us to divide ourselves--right?--since we have
some interests that keep us here talking?  What are they?

        Oh, gosh, man, gee, we're all trying to create ideas or
"theories" about disparate phenomena about how particular occur in the
world, if someone were to show me a model of economic-cultural
interaction that accounted for some of the events of the world it would
be good enough for me until someone else showed me a better model.  What
I mean is, I'm not trying to constrain but remain free from what you
rightly see as "appropriate" responses.  Yes, the mind makes
capital--with an a and an o--but is it my mind?  Just because we are in
it and part of it should not discourage one from exploring it.

        Ai, ai, ai, ai. . . .  Geez, isn't this the sort of response you
yourself are indicating is what's wrong with the university, with the
competitive cutthroat world?  I mean, come on, what you're saying is I
have nothing to say, nothing interesting, anyway, which seems to me to be
precisely the attitude you find as so oppressive in the university.
Quit?  Why don't you join?  Let's find some common ground already, what
we're suffering from is the divide between critics and poets--a false
division. . . .   I'm a poet.  I'm a critic.  Nothing specific?  Huh?
Didn' you see my comments on Swarzenegger (sp)?  Lost all justification?
I'm confused.  If it weren't for the university I think the survival of
poetry would be a great deal more tenuous than it is.  Anyway, I don't
shy from Tom's comments, but I think this is simply not useful in terms
of learning from each other, or from a spritit of comradery (sp)--which he
himself suggests is what he is after. I have to wonder. . . .  See next
comments:

        Hm.


        There's more here I have to say, but can we put aside what
appears to be a growing divide?  I mean, honestly, whether we work in or
out of a particular institution we have a common set of concerns and
rather than . . . .  Well, you get the picture.  I just want to say,
also, that I have not tried to divide as much as draw attention to what
some have described as being "isolated" when that is not my experience.
If you want me to be more specific I could. . . .

I agree with Abby's comments whole heartedly, I just thought, too, that
it was interesting that in the context of the discussion of isolated
academics that an academic like Paglia is as popular as she obviously is;
and, I think, this also has to do with some of her more "conservative"
positions on issues like the canon.  She is funny and smart, and, sure,
what she does in freeing feminism of a "bad" connotation is an
interesting point, but is she really the sort of feminist you want on
television promoting feminism?  Steinum was supposed to talk here in
Tempe, AZ yesterday but cancelled--illness.  I agree a feminism made up
of different points of view would be a way to free it from negative
connotations, but what about her views of rape?

First, I, also, want to say that I have enjoyed being on the list
immensely.  I have learned a great deal in the past few weeks interaction
with y'all and look forward to continuing the banter.  I'm leaving for a
few days and won't be able to write for about a month, but I'll be back

Second, I'd like to know, more precisely, about Steve's view of "obvious

I direct a small press, Chax Press, and even though that work is barely
funded, the position is certainly involved with capital, having had some
funding from the state in various of its contexts, working with printers
who use papers made from trees, etc. I also am the director of a larger
nonprofit organization devoted to the book arts, a position more entwined
with corporate and foundation funding, the state again, which also runs
programs in conjunction with at least four universities, yet which
generally positions itself as concerned with "the artist" on the one hand
and "the community" on the other (& hopefully the hands are entertwined).
We don't often think of its necessary involvement with capital, but we
should.

That said, it still strikes me that, although there has been a lot of
intriguing conversation in this forum on this issue of where we work and
its relation to the world, it has largely also been guys talking about
their jobs as the place where they relate to said world. That seems
entirely limiting. At least an equal force in how I understand myself and
my relations with what is outside me is my family, including the
immediate one of wife and two children, ages 5 and 19 months, but
extending far and wide in both space and time, most recently made
poignant by the death of a 36-year-old cousin who was the high school
principal in the barely one high-school town of Clinton, Oklahoma, and
his funeral services which required a football field to accomodate those
who wished to memorialize him. Only one of the ways family leads to a
much wider "community."

I'm not certain where I want to take this, just that, although I don't
want to speak for anyone else, I know that contributors to this
discussion, including Ron Silliman and Tom Mandel, are significantly
involved in their immediate familial and human relationships and that
these provide a point of entrance into the world at least as important to
our politics and poetics as do our places of employment. I don't think
I'd want to turn this forum into a series of forays into the poetics of
diapers, but I do think there is something missing in terms of how we are
thinking of ourselves as a community (actually there are probably many
things missing). We boys & our jobs are not the only stories, and
certainly not even the only human activity we undertake which bears on
our relations to capital and more.

In response to charles alexander, yes even men must realize the "personal
is the political" as it were, because as 'talkers" or "yakkers" with our
"highfallutin'" ideas about things we men (since it is mostly men) have
really not 'evolved' much since the time of LYSISTRATA, and though I don't
wish to once again return to a reified "essentialist" grid of "male sphere"
vs "female sphere" in the "old fashioned" sense, certainly such a grid haunts
far more than these discussions on the "net" as it were. At the same time,
there are those of us who are not family-men (whether by choice or chance,
I cannot tell, "alas") who are not necessarily any less "responsible" or
"engaged" with community, etc. on levels such as you suggest. Though i don't
wish to criticize the "mainstream bourgeois family" as LESS IMPORTANT than
the "bourgeois quasi-bohemian lifestyle" I do wish to question a possible
assumption that claims that THE BOHO is more decadent than the FAMILY MAN.
(and this is hopefully not an attemptm on my part to merely reinscribe the
dialectics that have informed the "town' vs "gown" debate under different
terms). I wish you well with your family, but "the family" does not work for
all of us, and I'd like to see what "common ground" there can be between
it and the "boho" (for lack of a better word) rather than merely be antagonistic
context than the mere bohemian--at least since the 80's and the rise of the
L poets. Anyway, what does anyone make of this?

Steve -
        In an overwhelming example of "lest we forget"
I must report that it was I who instigated the DC
reading by my friends and C'land poets Kit, Ron and
Alan and Bill ! I certainly saw the flyer many times
and yes Rod did it - so he gets the credit for clevers
and I for, duh...
        Looking back at your post, I see that you
didn't mention Alan Bernheimer's participation in the
reading. Alan is a wonderful poet tho not what you'd
call a prolific fellow. I hadn't heard him read in a
decade (in wch we mostly lived in the same town) and
perhaps half the reading was of works I'd heard him
read before. The new stuff was terrific too.
        Alan was part of that angle of the then young
language crowd that came out of Yale and moved to SF.
Kit Robinson and Steve Benson were his classmates, and
now I can't remember whether Bob Perelman was also
in that bunch of college friends. I think so.
        If you don't know his work, it is collected
in two volumes (and we are all waiting for a third,
Alan): State Lounge (Tuumba, 1981) and Cafe Isotope
(The Figures, 1980). More or less on (at least yokable
to) our current subjects is his poem Carapace (wch

to Steve Shoemaker:

gee, I think you've agreed with me and gotten some distance on that
by being sarcastic. Perhaps I am the cause, in the sense
of having been unintentionally ironic; if so, apologies. I am not
a fan of irony, as I think it tends to strengthen the point to be
ironized. E.g. if your critique of the academy is ironic, you may
be taken to be an academic manque-ay (you know, sour grapes...).


As to: "i think i've put together some pretty
 interesting reading lists for my classes, lists that have
 included, for example, many people currently participating in
 this "list."  And i've also consistently found that, despite the
 odds against it, some pretty surprising things can happen in the
 classroom--things i haven't seen happen elsewhere very often."

I see no reason why this shdn't be true and I'm glad for all participants if it
is. It seems obvious to me that we should distinguish between teaching and
learning, which go on at all times and all levels and are activities where the
deepest human resources are engaged, and the institutional nexus we call the
academy. The discourse above is a consistent extension of, say Plato's 7th
letter (is my reference here accurate? the "spark"), and doesn't support an
institution, much less a current status thereof. I'm sure such events happened
in Heidegger's seminars in the late '30's too - would they invalidate a
critique of the German universities under Hitler? (no comparison or other cheap
shot intended here)

It is no more relevant to offer instances of teaching/learning as a
justification of the institution in its current condition than it is to
evidence the spiritual mystery attendant to life and thought as a justification
for the Inquisitional auto da fe (tho of course, this is just what was done).

Anyway, the point isn't a rejection of an institution but a contribution to it;
the strongest point you might make, you don't: if you want to change an
institution you must participate in it, give some big part of your life to it,
in whatever form it allows you to do so. So doing gives one a valid position,
and justifies beyond clever contradiction your "belief that despite its
troubled future, its horrendous contradictions etc., there are still some
good reasons to try to work within the academy." Good!

As to my self-righteousness: sorry, it ain't me babe. Your "corny old joke" is
quoted without an application. In other words, if I say something it's because
I've observed it, thought about it, lived it, and so concluded - provisionally.
You don't have to deal with it, but if you want to do so, the challenge is to
reply at the level of the statement. Nothing assumed.

That said, the words of mine you quote : "your industry is headed for a
collapse; it has lost all justification" are incomplete and misleading. I
meant, and shd have said, "all economic justification." I.e. I don't think the
economy of the coming century will have the same need for educated workers that
capitalism of the 2d half of the nineteenth century discovered and
institutionalized as a) mass literacy and b)a large workforce with flexible,
"analytic" skills. Therefore, I see the large institutions which were built up
out of those requirements as likely to collapse, the class of "clerks" as
likely to shrink, literacy and verbal skill as likely once again to become
specialized professionalisms, etc.

Obviously, this does not mean I'm in favor of such developments; I do however
see the endless marginalization and mediation of the application of ideas, all
that to me seems characteristic of the amorph that dubs itself "theory," as
evidence in that direction. Nor that I'm right, gloomily enthusiastic soul that
I am.

As to my animadversions re: "the narrow reading list," it would be fair to ask
me to point to what I think ought to be, but is not, on that list - if we go
much further with that thread I'll be forced to contribute an enumeration.

The facts Ernest Mandel cites are horrible. Nor is the
barbarism of our time at question, a barbarism not
exactly restricted to what he calls "imperialism/
capitalism" (i.e. internationalized western-style
economies). His interpretation is at question,
however. ALL interpretations are at question, Steve.
And, yes, this is turning the volume too high, flipping
up the bass, and boogieing to the rhythm we already
know and love. I won't yield to you either in my horror
of this world nor in my deep need for a radical critique
of it. I just don't think you have proposed in these
words anything contributing to such a critique.

Indeed, is it possible to cite horror and take satisfaction in it as
supporting one's "position?" Is it impossible? Is it something
only the other guy, the bad guy, does?

As to:
        The "you who can eliminate capitalism" is

        but made, not a faded bumper sticker but
        a still distant prospect.  Is that too
        hortatory and enthusiastic?

that's right, it is. Is the "still distant" place where you see
this plural you a "not... faded" picture of a future reality?
Is it a carrot? Is your mind, producing this verbal metaphor set,
outside of history? A history in which you would be able to
find many other such pictures. Pictures to which at you must
submit yours, as one in a long series. A series
which requires a very close attention as to how we must
understand it. An understanding that would allow us not
to turn up the volume, not to cite horror at each other as if
failing to agree with your, anyone's, interpretation of
that horror were to make oneself complicit with horror.
A horror applicable at large levels and small: a friend of
mine's brother was murdered this week. This week and
every week, I am someone's brother, are you?

        I have been working in the Academy since 1971.  The only
other job I have had in my adult life was working in a warehouse. I
prefer the academy.

        It seems to me that this thread--unlike most threads on
this list-- has been generally ill-informed and bogged down in
stereotypes.

        The academy, like every thing else in Babylon, is a mess.
It is the most conservative cultural institutions.  The archives
for which it is responsible _is_, or used to be, THE culture. Its
function is as an adjunct to the human genome, and it systematically
inscribes the code on generation after generation. Or tries to,
often with minimal success.

        Of course, I am speaking here of the institution as a
whole, not just graduate school in English (this has been deep
confusion in this discussion).

        The institution is almost wholly mediated by the alphabet--
and the alphabet suddenly turns out to be a relatively insignificant
medium.  The kind of reading that the New Critics thought to teach
to, if not the masses, a very large middle class is increasingly
a specialized skill, like say being able to solve differential
equations.  A large majority of our 1000-plus English majors here
at Albany are pre-law or pre-M.B.A. (Business schools like students
who can read and write).

        Of course, most graduate programs in English have refused
to notice this fact, and wouldn't know what to do about it if they
would notice it. Conservative institutions are by there nature not
prepared to deal with this kind of change.

        But academia  is not in as bad a crack as, say, the
auto industry which has failed to notice that their business is likely
to be seriously impeded when exhaust pollution does permanent damage
to the biosphere.

        I would say my work in the university has been fairly successful.
Every year I encounter a few people who like to read and their adrenalin
gets up over thinking, and talking, who in this culture are likely to
feel that they are crazy or worthless, and I tell them that they are not
crazy or worthless, and some of them believe me.  This seems to me,
given the circumstances, fairly useful.

Those "instances of teaching/learning" are, for better or worse, in some
sense organized and permitted by the "institution" that is the academy. So
it seems to me fair to adduce those instances in a discussion of said
institution.  I agree, however, that that is only one part of the story, &
not adequate on its own without attention to the larger structural/cultural/
corporate context.  But all those levels, including the level of classroom
"instances," are imbricated.

Well, there's a big difference between "all justification" and "all economic
justification" and i don't think a more "complete" quotation on my part
cld have smoothed over that gap.  At any rate, i responded to the first
phrase, hearing a different meaning than you unpack here.

Whew. We seem to be hitting a stage here, where we all feel compelled to
spell out our "distinctions," which frequently get expressed as binary
oppositions: town/gown, G1/G2, boho/family, men/women, whites/people of
color.  Probably this process is inevitable, and hopefully a prelude to
new and productive "negotiations" among various "subject positions."  It's
an old question by now, but apparently still relevant:  as we follow the

Is it really possible, even in our supposedly pomo universe?

James Sherry's comments on internationalism are quite to the point and,
for me, heartening. Patricularly his closing sentence advocating active shaping
as opposed to after-the-fact resistance. With that in mind, what I'd like to
see here is a discussion related to the necessity of forming alliances
between so-called "intellectual classes" (to use a Wall St. Journal epithet) &
the used-to-be-called "Reagan Democrats" who remain in the moral and
intellectual stupor massaged into them by Gingrich & Co.

Face it, with the results of the last election, Amerika's going to be getting
a lot crueler before it gets any more compassionate. Having worked for one of
the world's largest management consultants (specializing in "business process
reengineering" = downsizing), I can report that *this* particular aspect of
"internationalism" is a juggernaut that does not appear to be slowing down

I get the feeling that the earnest postings I have read on this list may come
to nothing if intellectuals (such as the members of POETICS) cannot devise a
method of narrowing what has becoming a widening *cultural* gap in this
country.  Mr. Gingrich only succeeds because he recognizes fertile ground on
which to capitalize.

I've got a piece of stale, moldy news: we're walking on the same piece of
ground, and we'd better search for potential allies from outside our rather
circumscribed communities. I probably sound like I'm advocating James's
second (undesirable) course: resistance over pro-active shaping.  On the
contrary, but I seem to come up with conflicting ideas on how to begin on the

        On what possible grounds might such an alliance be
based?

        So called Reagan Democrats, who are little different
from Reagan Republicans, are devoted solely, as far as I can see,
to greed.

        I would suggest that corporate down-sizing is being done--
like everything else-- backwards.  Rather than having businesses
devoted to downsizing corporations, we should have businesses devoted
to restructuring cities that could function without automobiles.
The downsizing of corporations would then follow as a natural
consequence.

        The great repressed fact--comparable to the repression of
sexuality in the 19th century-- is that the earth cannot long support
the levels of exploitation it is now supporting.  It certainly
can't support several billion Asians, AFricans, and Latin Americans
at the level of material waste that everyone enjoys witnessing on
satelite TV.  It can't even support a significant number of excluded
Americans and Europeans at that level.

        It seems to be two things need to happen:

        1) We need something like a kind of psychoanalysis to
bring repressed greed to consciousness;

        2) We need to find something other than material extravagance
as a motivating human factor.

        Of course, conceiving a viable politics on the basis of
these principles is a difficult, but nothing less appears viable.

I am intrigued by the idea of alliances among communities, as per
Nasdor's and Byrd's posts . . . particulary as we have been so
preoccupied with articulating our differences.  Where are the connections
and possibilities for interactivity?  Alas, I am leaving, tomorrow for a
month, and will miss being able to respond for such a long period of
time, but, rest assured, I am going to pour over the past posts in some
detail on my contemplative journey (I'm taking the train--three days!)
across the American landscape.  I've never made the journey in the
winter.  I would just like to leave with the thought that while it has
been highly useful to observe the differences in positions, the direction
Byrd and Nasdor suggest may prove, at least, equally useful.  Perhaps I
suffer under the delusion that discussions and issues such as we have
been preoccupied with here are somehow important or even part of a larger
world. . .but the investment we have all made suggests to me very much
otherwise.  Now, what do we do?

For a good while now while working in the English Department
 I have been  writing poetry, teaching American poetry.writing about it,
 writing about contemporary  art , and operating as a free-lance
curator and arts administrator. This mix has served to  deliver to hand
a situation of sufficient complexity. Also, since the campus is located
downtown as most of you folks say, I can  get out of here easily and  see
shows, meet up with artists, dealers, etc.  (I have thought the dis-
location of  so many US universities from city life is one of their major
drawbacks and, in particular accounts for their distance from, in-
comprehension of, contemporary art practices) I have not worked for
corporations, but  have been under contract to  art museums, arts
councils, and cultural foundations for quite large exhibition, conference,
 and publication projects. This extra-mural activity is on-going;  it seems
a permanent and necessary part of my programme.  I have learnt a
great deal from it, not the least being the demands it make for all
manner of competencies not required or thought of within the Uni-
versity. And it is essential to any notion I might have of my contrib-
ution to the University-as-Academy.  Although at first reluctant to
accept  these breaches of Discipline--the Discipline of English, that
is--the University, I must say, has gradually come to accept them.

That's a relatively recent phenomenon, brought about after 1980 by Reagan and
cohorts; that is, convincing the traditional working classes that they were
mistaken to follow any sort of "left" agenda. I believe the Reagan
Republicans began chewing away at their weakest links to the Democratic Party--
by engaging them in the *cultural* arena before introducing the greed factor--
and then convinced them that the accumulation of material possessions, as well
as the practice of conspicuous consumption, was the "correct" stance. It is
all too obvious that the Democratic Party was, and remains, so fearful of
engaging its core constituency because it is, in fact way out of touch. The
Republicans are correct on that point, but for the wrong reasons. And as I
posted earlier, Gingrich et al focus on culture first economics second. That
can make it difficult to engage *anyone* in a Marxist analysis of the problem
if one limits one's arguments to economics.

A fantasy, Don. There are so few cities that could be restructured in such a
manner (even if funds were available). Further, the majority of Americans
(80%, I believe) live outside of cities, mostly in suburbs or exurbs. The car
still rules, unfortunately, and will continue to do so as businesses continue
to flee urban areas for the new zones of "worker housing"--townhouse ghettoes.

To respond to Chris Stroffolino, no indeed the BOHO is not less important
or more irresponsible than the FAMILY. Indeed there are contemporary
crises in both. And we are all, if not parents, children. Just to agree
with you that the terms of person need to be part of the discussion as
much as the terms of work.

i didn't read charle's original post as refering to a narrow/

a counterbalance on the side of _human_ relationships when the
discussion has been focused on _economic_ relationships  (&& yeah
i know, they can't be seperated frm one another etc; but bottom-

Hm.  Clearly didn't make myself clear, there.  I'm very doubtful of the

I don't mean to be arrogant, merely obnoxious and suspicious.  What part
of the US isn't based on land improperly seized from someone?  Where are
all the rest of us supposed to go?  And, again, what if we don't want
to?  I think the worst-case scenario must always be faced:  I doubt that
you or I can flip through a list of revolutionary / sovereignty movements
and determine, in advance, who'll be violent, especially based on notions of
"imperialism."  Too many counterexamples.

As someone who regularly teaches American lit to freshmen &

One sentence here stands out:

This would seem to be a "classic" question of a group's relation to
power (the center). That which is at the center (or conceives of itself
as a center) moves outward, imperial motion. That which perceives itself
at the margin merely defines the margin (builds that border). Both seem
to involve an essential(ist) xenophobia. Such is at the heart of every
identity politics. The relative danger comes from the relation to power,
no?

And at the real center comes that almost snow blindness of presuming
it's "just us." Hence prop 187 in California and the Bubba vote
throughout the US in 1994, revenge of the white males.

Interesting how, given what a "boy" discussion this has been for the
past week or so, nobody here at all takes the standard Bubba position,
even while the range of politics and poetics involved seems pretty
broad. To be a poet makes an internationalist out of many (at least here
in the US -- Dubravka Djuric has noted how many opportunistic poets in
Serbia have taken advantage of the situation there to gather little
fiefdoms of state power and how even the opposition Croat and Bosnian
poets have quickly moved into nationalist positions that seem to have as
much to do with what's in it for them as it does the needs of "their
people."

So what is this concept "my people"?

Ron Silliman asks, whether rhetorically or not  -  What is this concept "my

I agree the term is problematic.  A bit different than the concept "my
community."  Seems that "my people", in identity politics, usually implies a
sense of shared loss, or potentially shared loss.  Seems that usually all of
"my people" are fairly easily distinguishable from others, at LEAST to some
potentially threatening others.  I don't think the use of the term
necessarily implies xenophia.  Just like fear doesn't necessarily imply
paranoia.  Its use is often an attempt to unify in the face of division &
conquering, no?  On the other hand, the term could be used to rally the
troops for extermination of an other.  There's nothing inherently wrong in
using the term, or good, it seems to me.  Not only adds to binary confusion,
but could help people gain a better "sense of themselves", no matter how
illusory or how real, with which to participate in the world.

I imagine the concept is an absolutely essential one for many people.

Contrary to Tom & Ron, I would like to offer anyone
pursuing an academic career this advice: stay in school!
I decided a long time ago not to go to graduate school.
Now I have to hustle my butt off just to make ends meet.
I don't even have time to read all these emails!  I think
the reason I decided not to go to graduate school had
something to do with wanting to become a poet.  Of the
many, many poets whose work I admire, none have been
academics.  But there's always a first time, and this might
be it!

Having been through some graduate school, taught at NYU for a few years,
worked as an independent entrepreneur, worked as a capitalist lackey,
done manual labor painting outsides of high rises, published 10 books
that made money and 8 books (poetry) that lost money, published 75
literary titles, run a non-profit distribution service, worked for the
city of New York, and since I am always looking for work to do I figure I
have failed at everything I have ever tried to do. In the light of this
experience which I do not wish to describe as holier, simply that I have
some direct experience of both sides of the fence that is being disputed
as well as other fences of the labor market not described, I would expect
that any honest look at the corporations and universities described in
your letters differ little from each other in their most important
respects. Generally universities treat workers worse and do less damage
with their output while corporations treat workers better in comparable
positions, but engage in risk taking to the extent that their output has
a greater direct effect, good and bad, on the society, environment, and
individual lives. They make together two of the many kinds of
institutions we live with and any attempt to denigrate either type of
institution is both narrow and irrelevant. The risks of corporate life
now are great. The inability of universities to significantly amend those
risks is pathetic. Read today's NY Times re: Bass & Yale.
Transnationalism is a fact. Can these discussions turn that situation
around? Can we add an accent to it that will increase the benevolence of
our physical and intellectual environment in an entire world? How do you
expect to affect it? What is your program? What cooperation does this
group offer?

Once again Steve, your response to Ron is counter productive, well
reasoned, but can you accept that a single world exists whose cultures ar
merging and their intersection causes these clashes. The emerging world
culture is not better or worse than the indigenous cultures that are
being infected by each other. Ron's anti-universal arguement and your
response to it, "true or false universalism", are again polarizing a
world that can be viewed as having two poles or two critical loci of its
magnetic field. The arguments pro and con do not elucidate the way they
interact, only the way you feel them impacting your personal life. I
hardly consider your position universal.

It's been a pleasure performing a kind of lump sum lurking in this Poetics
forum, following a patch of down time while a crafty computer consultant
helped unclog this machine, thereby freeing up space to let the AOL upgrade
flower.

Spooling back to the issues concerning how to mesh ethics and workplace and
needed action, it would seem that at every turn there's  temptation to freeze
(not act) on account of the rampant impurities that are evident in virtually
every institution.  Having spent about 15 years in the private sector and
only a few in the public sector, and now having clients in both, I've liked
the fluency that one gains from operating in a corporate context.  It has
often (if not always) felt necessary to sort and strain value from the
inevitable dross one finds there.  And, of course, those who've NOT worked in
the private sector probably find greater mystique in that milieu than do
those who have.  Why talk about this?  Simply to say that one of the things
that "gets learned" in the many types of environment that are spawned by
greed is the value of amassing little accomplishments, taking action (I
prefer not to use the term "small wins," as this connotes at least a battle,
if not a war).  There's a kind of confidence, false or not, that one can
glean from focusing and directing attention and then acting.  And I'm sure
there are plenty of things one could edit out of  such experience.  But I
find that seeking purity prior to taking action is an exasperating
experience.

The point of this is that the best of what's available in a corporate
experience frames (thereby makes possible) an action mentality that COULD
(although it does not often enough) yield value for social concerns.

I absolutely never feel I've done enough about anything in the way of our
largest problems (those real biggies).  But it seems that forming hinges
between little effort and little effort can at least foster mental health as
some version of a collective pads along trying to progress.

The institutionalization of greed, the fostering of subset addictions via the
established channels, make all progress feel impossible at times.  And yet it
is very likely in our small units of communing we live out values that keep
shaping the world.

So while some kind of conviction and effort (proof) that action is possible,
there are daunting odds.  As each day reveals, it's got to be worth it to
try.

        Undergraduates by and large have never had the experience
of grand coherence.  I try to teach them to look for big patterns and
make it cohere.

        Beginning graduate students usually cohere excessively.
I try to teach them to let go (Charles' list of algorithm's here
might be useful).

        Advanced graduate students typically have fallen into
utter chaos.  I try to teach them to cohere.

        The distance between coherence1 of the undergraduates
and coherence2 of the advanced graduate students is considerale.
There is a coherence that is closed and a coherence that is open.

I spent a month on Maui in 1987 and found a the presence of a suffocating
racial pecking order which put white celebrity types and "windsurf nazis" as
well as rich Japanese country clubbers on top, native Hawaiians second (due to
their land-grant rights and not least their will to be heard), Chinese third,
and everybody seemed to beat on the Filipinos, who were stereotyped as living
in trailer parks filled with red velvet furniture and Elvises everywhere. I not
only found this annoying, I almost got the shit beaten out of me when I went
to the wrong bar to have a drink. I had to keep reminding people that I was not
a resident, which immediately exempted me from having to participate in this
little game.

Otherwise it was a paradise.

Well,...

        1. No one occupies a position from where it is possible to
        see what multiple cultures are doing on a world scale, esp.
        not as the pictured fantasy involves the future, which it
        is in principle not possible to know.

        2. That an emerging world culture (assume it for a moment) is
        "not better or worse than the indigenous cultures" is either not
        an empirical statement (i.e. it is an anthropologist's position)
        or if it is one, where's the evidence? One could certainly argue
        that the culture of the Roman Empire, for example, as it
        grafted itself onto and lived off of indigenous cultures all
        over Europe and the Med. basin, was a disaster for those cultures,
        tragedy for their people. I don't think James can assure any
        "indigenous culture" anywhere that the global transformation
        he sees will be "not better or worse" for them.

        3. Someone somewhere ought to formalize and describe an ailment
        of the intellect that he/she might call "the consolation of
        terms." Apparently, mere possession of a term like "culture" is
        sufficient to give its possessor a sense of having risen above
        the sombre cthonic clash of undescribed human interests whose
        stake and way in the world is being steamrollered. Get thee
        behind me terminology.

Sheila Murphy's phrase "institutionalizaiton of greed" struck me as very
 useful in the context of both the occupational identity discussions and
  Don Byrd's splendidly splenetic manifesto. Frankly I'm bored with the aspect
   of the discussion about which is better academic or corporate or both or
   neither, or family or boho etc. We all made and make choices and they have
   consequences, so lets go on with it. A pickpocket can be a great poet
  (Villon) and so can a saint-- the confusion for my generation was that we
   confused the exoteric and esoteric -- many of us needed the identity of poet
    before we ever had the practice. Back to greed: I follow the Buddhist
  perspective: it is a basic aberration    of mind, one of the three poisons
   also identified with attachment or clinging. Precisely because it is
   universal, there's no sense looking for greed out there (in corporations,
   universities etc.)-- it's right here folks and is active in various ways
   from moment to moment, whether we are greedy for a toast crumb or a
     tenured professorship. Now Sheila's phrase, institutionalization of greed
   is to the point-- the great engines of capital refine, develop and advertise
   new attachments and the wheels keep spinning. Various spiritual disciplines,
    meditation and prayer-- do offer a perspective adn a practice for
   recognizing the nature of greed and a de-conditioning from its allure.
     And I think it better to work on ourselves than to assume the enemy is
  some 'they" out there.   Rodger Kamenetz  enrodg@lsuvm.sncc.lsu.edu

AMERICA: A PRAYER

The Honorable Newt Gingrich has informed us that prayer in the public
schools is one of the most important issues facing this great nation, and
in our firm belief that America doesn't have a prayer, we call upon the
Poets of America to give America a prayer. Opportunity is crucial in a
capitalist society. We feel therefore that this, the 104th Congress,
should have the opportunity to authorize the production of the
appropriate American prayer from amongst the deeply felt works of
America's finest, most challenging, and dedicated writers.

America's prayer is meant to be read by everybody, but don't let that
stop you. Your prayers should be 500 words or less. Please send two
copies of your prayer. One, marked "Proposal for Prayer for the Schools,"
should be sent to The Honorable Newt Gingrich, House of Representatives,
2428 Rayburn Hourse Office Bldg., Washington, D.C. 20515. The other copy
should be sent with self-addressed stamped-envelope to Aerial/Edge at the
address below. Selections of the prayers we received will appear in an
upcoming issue of The New Censorship, and possibly some other forums; we
encourage interested publishers to contact us as well. No strictures on
style or content. Writers may or may not wish to imagine delivery of
their prayer in a classroom context. You do not have to be a U.S. citizen
to participate. Also interested in visual materials. Please pass this
opportunity on to as many people as possible.

Deadline: Feb. 28, 1995.

        I'd say, Pierre, that the first symptoms of repressed greed
are incivility and loss of humor (laughter first, the sense of gentle
irony thereafter). Of course, Amurikans aren't the only greedy ones,
but we probably lead the field...

        Probably the sense of irony was the big losser in this last
election.  Certainly, a sense of humor.  The only way to rid the
body politics of the likes of Newt Gingrich is with wild laughter.

In-Reply-To:  Message of Tue, 13 Dec 1994 11:36:49 -0500 from
              <djb85@CSC.ALBANY.EDU>

Pierre Joris notes that laughter is what
he misses most in "Yankeeland," to which
I would just add--among those possibilities
of embodied interaction that get absented
here at the keyboard, the possibility of
sharing a laugh is the one I most miss.

Absent that possibility, I know I drift
into a kind of unrelieved mordancy--not
terribly generous, and not terribly inter-
esting.  I take it that this tendency is
what James calls being "well reasoned"
(which I think translates roughly as "a bore").

I do know that without laughter to leaven
it, the "big talk" of politics strikes me
as out of scale, a kind of impossibility.
To the extent that I have persisted, it
has been in nervous awareness of that im-
possibility, as well as of the "consolation
of terminology" that Tom Mandel mentions.

By the way, I owe an apology to Tom for
assuming a while back that I knew what
his response to a statement of mine might be--
the gesture rang of defensiveness and cut
against the grain of our for(u)m here,
where allowing for surprise is a key value.

I sometimes wonder if the disjunction between
abstract/concrete (or better: what is thought
and what is actionable) isn't the most pressing
concrete fact of current political life.  In
other contexts, I've thought that beginning with
the specificity of poetry is the best check against
going to the abstract too quickly (to paraphrase
Sartre on the universal and to recall, also, that
passage of Joan Cock's (?) which Patrick cited a
while back).  With the exception of Tom's inclusion
of an Alan Bernheimer poem a few days ago, I think
I've missed poetry only a little less than I've missed
laughter in recent days.  I don't mean to construct
yet another binary--I don't credit separations of
poetry and politics and I doubt others here do either--
but just to note that the value we convene around
here is primarily that of poetic practice: after that,
the spectrum of political positioning is, if not
stunningly unpredictable(it isn't), a perhaps rather
highly individuated mirror of the available categories
that structure the wider citizenry.

At this moment, the possibility of "internationalism"
strikes me as the most interesting topic for
further discussion--as an actionable thought some
of us are having.  I agree with Ron that it is
not coincidental that poets, and intellectuals more
generally, should be thinking such thoughts.  At
the risk of consolidating that reading-list Tom
has expressed antipathy towards, I think Bourdieu
has some good things to say in this regard in his
address called "Universal Corporatism: The Role of
Intellectuals in the Modern World" (Poetics Today
12.4 [1991]: 655-669).  I would also refer those who
have questioned my use of the term "autonomy" to
that essay for a sense of how I have been intending it.

Well, I near the end without having elicited a single
chuckle I'm sure.  Alas--

I just discovered a new "emoticon":   ^;^

It looks to me like a cat sticking out its tongue.  I propose we let it
preside as a sort of dark "familiar," invoking the spirit of (necessarily
macabre?) comedy Pierre recommends.

in reply to Pierre Joris:

Fine, how about your place?

I remember reading somewhere in Georges Perec (I think in an
occasional piece in his magazine, name of wch I forget) teh
delightful observation wch I must paraphrase, that there is
no writer, however much he regards himself (or she herself)
as doing serious work, who has not lain in bed with the sound
of the working class outside heading off to work and felt
a satisfaction either sly or hearty at what he/she has gotten
away with in this world!

Where, by th eway, are all these posts advising anyone that is
better to work in the corporate world (better for who and what).
I haven't noticed any. Personally, I recommend to anyone who
doesn't mind the personal uncertainties therewith associated
to work for his or herself.

AUSTRALIAN WRITING ONLINE is a small press distribution service which we
hope will help Australian magazines, journals and publishers to reach a
much wider audience through the internet. As a first step we will be
posting information and subscription details for a number of magazines and
publishers to a number of discussion groups and lists. We hope to build up
a large emailing list which includes as many libraries as possible. If you
know of a list or discussion group which you think might be worthwhile
posting or if you would like more information about AWOL please email AWOL

SOUTHERLY

Southerly is Australia's oldest literary magazine. For over fifty years it
has held a central place in the making of Australian literature. The work
of Australia's finest writers has appeared in its pages, and been discussed
in its critical essays and commentaries.

Now Southerly has a renewed appeal, with a clear new design by Toni
Hope-Caten, and covers which feature work by Australian artists from the
collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney. The presentation of
the magazine's contents has also changed. We publish a wide range of
poetry, fiction and criticism from writers all over Australia and New
Zealand. But we also seek out or commission writing which has a special
appeal, because of innovative or challenging qualities, or because it helps
to throw new light on current literary concerns.

The September 1994 issue of Southerly features excerpts from Fay Zwicky's
unpublished journal and essays on her poetry by Ivor Indyk and Elsa
Linguanti; a selection of work by the poets associated with Collective
Effort, including a long poem from P0 's epic '24 Hours'; new poems by
Peter Skrzynecki and an essay on his poetry by Michael Griffith; Carl
Harrison-Ford on literary hoaxes; poetry by the New Zealand poet Lauris
Edmonds; and reviews of contemporary Australian writing by Judith
Beveridge, Evelyn Juers, Noel Rowe and Nicolette Stasko.

The December issue of Southerly includes new pieces by Archie Weller,
Antigone Kefala and Dorothy Porter; an important paper by David Carter on
the reverse cultural cringe in Australian literature; essays by Jill Roe on
Miles Franklin, Simon Petch on Janet Frame and Tony Winner on David Malouf;
and fiction and poetry by Fiona Place, Grant Caldwell, Geoff Page, Richard
Allen, Jill Jones and many more.

Some weeks ago, as I recall, someone gave the name of the New Mexico
publisher who's bringing out the complete ARK.  I lost my copy of this
information, & am eager to get a copy or galleys to help me finish a
Dictionary of Literary Biography entry on RJ.  I've left word for the
poet himself, out at Berkeley, but if anyone here could pass the info
along, I'd appreciate it.

(Am also ISO a copy of the out-of-print "Complete Short & Early Works" to
supplement what I've been able to work with at the Library of Congress so
far.  Will pay postage & copying costs, if necessary.)

Hi, In case you have not heard of this resolution I am forwarding it to
you. I have been in touch with Julio Ramos and he is working on a proposal
for the Humanities Institute at Irvine for a subaltern colloquium.  He
needs to know when would it be a good time in Fall 95. I thought of the
middle of October, after LASA and the semester has gotten going. Let me
know what you think. It seems that the issue of DISPOSITIO before ours
should be finished this semester, so we should be next by the beginning of
the year. You need to send me your revised version. Don't forget to
include a diskette. Un abrazo, Jose

Subject: MLA Resolution vs Proposition 187

Colleagues and friends:

        I am helping circulate a resolution, to be proposed at the Modern
Language Association Convention, Dec. 26-30, in San Diego, calling for the MLA
-- the largest professional academic association in the country, perhaps the
world -- to oppose Prop. 187; to urge teachers not to cooperate with it; and
not to meet in California until the anti-immigrant provisions of Prop. 187 are
repealed.

        If anyone reading this note is a current member of the MLA, or knows
MLA members, I urge you to put your name to the resolution below and return it
to me, and to forward the text of the resolution, either electronically or in
hard copy, to other members for their signatures. They may return them to me at
my address (below).

        If this resolution were to be passed, it would represent a considerable
blow to the convention business in CA. But more important by far would be the
message it would send to educators and the world at large.

        Please feel free to repost this message to other newsgroups and on
relevant Listservers, but please be sure to ask that the signed resolutions be
returned to me by Dec. 24, as I have to take them to San Diego on Dec. 26.

        Sincerely,

                   Resolution in Opposition to Proposition 187

        WHEREAS the recently-passed ballot California initiative called
        Proposition 187 has called for the denial of public education--at
        the primary, secondary, junior college, college, and university
        levels--to undocumented workers and their children; and

        WHEREAS public school teachers have been required to help verify
        the citizenship status of their students, in effect to serve as
        INS agents; and

        WHEREAS Proposition 187 was passed in an election year
        characterized by an alarmingly xenophobic and racist atmosphere
        in which undocumented workers became scapegoats for the economic
        problems facing California's working people, even though
        immigrant workers, both undocumented and documented, continue to
        be a mainstay of California's economy; and

        WHEREAS the dangerously fascistic implications of Proposition 187
        are revealed by the fact that the "Save Our State" movement
        backing Proposition 187 was funded in significant part by the
        Pioneer Foundation, a group that has since the 1930s been
        committed to demonstrating the genetic inferiority of African-
        American and other nonwhite peoples; and

        WHEREAS the Modern Language Association is committed to extending
        education to all segments of the US population and is unalterably
        opposed to all forms of xenophobic and racist ideology and
        practice;

        BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Modern Language Association condemns the
        denial of public education to undocumented workers and their
        children in California and takes steps to publicize this
        condemnation; and

        BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT the MLA urges present and future
        public school teachers not to cooperate with the State request to
        verify the legality of their students' immigration status; and

        BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT the MLA refuses to hold any meetings
        or conventions in California until such a time as the anti-
        immigrant provisions of Proposition 187 are repealed.

        We the undersigned members of the MLA, urge that the above
        resolution be discussed and passed at the 1994 Convention.

Today I only changed three diapers, but signed 300 or so fundraising
letters, worked on one mid-length poem, put off writing a review,
shoveled the snow (two days late) on a sidewalk, sat with children while
spouse went to do her chore as representative on an interim steering
committee for a neighborhood revitalization plan, and may have danced
semi-naked in front of my window, but feel neither particularly mad nor
happy. I think if one goes deeply enough into the family unit one

In-Reply-To:  <01HKLQ7IWOECANCHUN@VX.CIS.UMN.EDU>

There was a message several days ago which sought response to questions
as to the value of the NEA in this time of its attack following recent
elections. I certainly don't have the answer to those questions, but I
have been asked to speak with a group of six literary organizations here
in Minneapolis this Sunday (four of which are four of the eight largest
non-profit literary publishers in the country, one of which is the
largest independent writer's center in the country, the other of which is
the center for book arts I direct -- they all bring in ideas about
literary practice which I don't particularly share, but also seem to
bring in a willingness to cooperate for the good of all, if such is
possible). The agenda for this meeting is this congressional attack on
the NEA (as I hear it, opinion ranges everywhere from a sense that the
NEA will be abolished to, at the most optimistic, that it will receive a
10% cut each year for the next five years) and how to respond to such. If
any on this forum have a particular interest in this, or specific
ideas/questions to bring to such a meeting, I would love to hear from you
before Sunday morning (Dec. 18), either on this forum, in my private
e-mail box (mcba@maroon.tc.umn.edu), or by telephone at work (612-338-3634).
Thank you.

My big gray castrated cat lies in my lap
while I read these scrolls, and while I'm mousing
I scratch his head and he purs and his tongue
hangs out like Stimpy.  I have to laugh.  It's true
that when you work for a corporation you get a sense
of the act, like you put your documentation together
I guess and then you confer with your people
and then you have begun to set a wheel in motion
and that wheel is money and it is an act.
A genre is an act.  Also an identity.
I confess, though, that I've never been able to lie in bed
while the rest of the world goes off to work...
not an ethical thing, but insomnia.  Up until now
I though poets were just other people with insomnia.

        Sorry to hear about traumatic experiences in "paradise."  Of
course the word itself, so often applied to Hawaii in the national media,
to say nothing of Visitor's Board brochures, is no help at all.  Just a
couple more thoughts related to teaching in a multicultural classroom,
and also inspired by a cursory look at the new Penguin anthology,
_Unsettling America: An Anthology of Contemporary Multicultural Poetry_.
I'm above all struck by the fact that (and my look was cursory) all the
poems are in standard English.  Well, there are a few Spanish words here
and there . . .  But I've found myself, as a contemporary poetry person,
teaching poems in Hawaiian pidgin, as well as poems written in Hawaiian
that are translated on the facing page.  The idea of "teaching" poems in
a language that I don't know, but my students do, does have a certain
absurd appeal to it, but hardly seems ideal, except insofar as the
students gain from the task of explaining words and cultural references
to me.  Surely there's American literature out there in Spanish, in
Chinese, in Yiddish, and so on that belongs in a "multicultural
anthology."

This brings me back to a question about the function of the university,
with its emphasis, linguistic and actual, on "uni"fying knowledge.  And
the nationalistic function of privileging English (in part through the
mere fact that someone like me doesn't speak pidgin, not being from the
place where I'm teaching) over other languages that Americans speak.  How
would hiring practices (so much on English departments' minds this time of
year) be affected by a re-evaluation, or revaluation, of this language
question?  I was intrigued by someone's comment about how Newt and his
pals are beginning with a cultural agenda, rather than an economic one.
The English-only movement will surely get a shot in the arm.  What ARE the
alternatives to English-only classrooms?  Also with Ron Silliman's claim
that American poets are "internationalist."  When I'm optimistic I think
so, but when I pick up an anthology like the multicultural one, I wonder
if we're even being true to the internationalism that exists inside the
US.

I'm also thinking about Peter Quartermain's and Charles Bernstein's
essays on the effect of non-native speakers on American literature in
English.  It might bear looking at this effect in contemporary
circumstances, as well as in the cases of Stein and Williams.  To say
nothing of the effect of American literature on native Hawaiian
literature (much of it oral, and hence not "literature" at all).  Does
anyone know of such a thing?

And, not to be too uni-centric, I'd be curious to hear how corporations
are dealing with issues like this.

We've been having trades of up to 40 mph for the past several days and,
all things being relative, it's freezing.  Keeps us at our computer
screens.

Listening to the background noise of the internet this morning, I
noticed, although I haven't read all 100 messages in my inbox that there
is both an internationalist and a multi-cultural trend which ought to be
able to find common ground. As Steve Evans evinced, the international
issue is vital to our future as writers, but how can we writers be
international in one language, even if it is English? If English is the
world language of today, it is so to an elite and their supporters.
Multiculturalism represents the values of unique cultures and their
languages. If we follow a multicultural trend, we will continue to
celebrate our differences as long as they are celebratory and fall to
fighting about the relative values of our uniqueness when we feel
threatened or have genuine differences. Yugoslavia, Somalia, Ruwanda,
Southern Russia, the list is as long as there are conflicts.

Of course it makes sense that Newt has a cultural agenda. If he supports
a culture, it will support him, but is this the last gasp of nationalism.
Not by a long shot. Not until a manageable number of languages, say two
or three have taken over the globe, transparent currency exchanges are a
fact of daily life, and the world bank dictates environmental policy in
supposedly sovereign states can transnationalism be said to have taken
over the world in any kind of successful way.

What, you say, all that is already true? Well, I'll be.

Susan Schultz: International corporations are controlled by multi-lingual
managers who do not view having to switch from one to another as an
imposition or as a threat to their personal identity and that of their
families, but as means of control, because they can and frankly because
they must. That's the value of multi-culturalism--we must speak to each
other.

But most of the values of our literatures are based in a specific
language, aligning writers with national or language-centered movements.
A real dilemon, I'd say, because no matter how good you are at two or
even three languages, your best shot in a foreign lanugage is facile or
based on a limited vocabulary and set of resonances. Where is the
poly-semous complexity that we all revel in when we speak English, if we
have to be multi-lingual. Even then the marginal languages get
disappeared.

In NY for example my German supervisor speaks English and is excited
about using idiom. In Hawaii I hear the universe-ity is afraid of the
influence of native language. Any wonder where the power is?

Rereading this I guess a lot of it is obvious, but the issues for poets
are difficult, challenging some of our dearest assumptions.

I'd like to add one modest experiment to the list Charles compiled:

Homophobic Translation. Take any e-mail you disagree with and respond
to it high-handedly, concealing any confusion you might have on the
subject. Insist on a tone that will demolish rather than convince your
phantom adversary of another point of view. Cover your tracks with
ad hominem attacks on anyone who might have disagreed with you on any
subject. Be especially careful that these attacks do not touch on any of
the values or issues on which your imagined opponent might be correct.
Ignore any attempt to sidetrack the putative argument with reason, fact,
or personal concerns. Throw is a lot of obscure references to books you
have read in pre-publication galleys. Alternatively, coopt the issue
instead of disagreeing with it using humiliating imitations.
Alternatively, put your name on the ideas of others until you get taken
to court and are vindicated by huge advances for your next book.
Experimentation is such fun.

Where indeed? I haven't noticed any either! What I wrote was that the
"discussion of where its better to work, corp vs a.k.adamn" was
getting ever so slightly wearisome...unless I dreamed it, there was
discussion on the comparative merits of working for corporations
versus working in academia?

   No, Pierre, you didn't dream it, or I did too (and certainly there's
   no santa claus) but WHAT A DRAG--you think on a poetics list, especially
   one featuring many writers known for their problematizing of the old lyric
   "I" and its bulky humanistic cult of personalities, there'd be less
   "personality battles," less egomongering territorial pissing and at
   least some attention to, dare I say it, "poetry" or at least rockmusic
   in a way that isn't merely bitter like the comments on the Rolling Stones
   that imply a kind of dry smug superiority (that I am probably totally
   guilty of here). (By the way--there's a typo in the second line of this
   note--I meant "you'd think" not "you think"--"you" as in "one") Chris

  Dear Rodger Kamenetz--Not that I disagree with you about the value of
  fighting the enemy within (and fighting fighting for that matter, to
  get to a place that's unexpressable), but surely the enemy "out" there
  is not merely an ASSUMPTION--some of us can no longer afford the luxury
  to assume an ontology in which an INDIVIDUAL's interests are totally
  oppossed to the interests of a collectivity, I think it's a question
  not so much of compromise in its bandaid-on-the-wound sense, but of
  realizing that we are "always already" social, even in "meditation"
  which can also be "a weapon", right?

By "America," I take it, most of the people online here mean the U.S.

I wrote a prayer many years ago. It goes

"Lord, if I have but one life to live,

I hope this ain't it."

       Where are all these posts advising anyone that it is better to work

And Ron Silliman (Dec.l4)  quickly seconded this claim that there
have been none such.

So I asked my secretary to go through the dept. e-mail files and  to see if
he could find any. And to  have the report on my desk at his first opport-
unity.

The situation seems to be as follows: on Dec. 6 Ron fired off a post  in which
he said there was more collaborativeness in the corporate world than in the
university world. I.e. on that score (what) the corporation would be better for
academics (who). Also on the score of knowing what was really going on  in
the economy  --a must for anti-capitalists.  The following day, Tom, himself
posted to the effect that the world of commerce was more open, egalitarian,
permissive of range than the university world.  And that when you got sacked
from your job in business at least it was for a good reason. On Dec. l2 James
Sherry,  suggested that corporations treated workers better in comparable
positions than universities.

Well, Tom & Ron, you do make some good points.

I'd like to hear more about the not WORKING  for  LIVING  option. I don't
suppose there are too many on the List.  About PRIVATE  MEANS and how
to come by them. There 's not much history  in this discussion, but I believe
the Modernists , especially those expatriates living in Europe, had  great
access to such means. Is there a book on patronage and the avant-garde?
I am, of course,  aware that the issue for many is whether it is more dishon-
ourable to work  for business or the university, and that  taking  money from
aristocrats  or  magnates as they  used to be called, may be even more dis-
honourable, but  isn't the question: is it possible in this culture to be a full
poet,   to work for a living as a artist, important to the discussion ?

Here there a few residences and fellowships which allow poets a year
now and then  ( the residences are  at the universities, and academics who
happen to be poets can't apply!), but  the full-time artists I know are painters
and sculptors. That's a clear distinction, and a pretty recent one here: visual
artists can live off their work, poets can't.  They need a day  job (which is ho
Bruce Andrews described his university position to me).

Thank you Wystan Curnow, for setting the record straight. I was
beginning to think I had dozed off at the screen and dreamt it all. I
mean I know I dozed off at the screen, but I could have sworn it was
in the midst of some strange corporate/university competition.

As for "PRIVATE MEANS and how to come by them", the two time honored
methods are: 1) inherit it, 2) marry it. If these two methods are
unavailable to you, then all that's left, I think, is to schlepp
through it with the rest of us. Alas and alack.

The Literary Network was largely a one-woman project
(Lisa Cooley), and as far as i know, when she left in
the spring, the thing went on the back burner...


and, while i'm a fan of newts (& efts) & not of Newt,
i'm no big fan of the NEA, either... do they really
contribute all that much to non-mainstream culture?

Subject:      Re: Experiments

I've read through and felt challenged by the experiwhat? discussions on and off
for some time now. Yes, it is quite wrong to fall into the trap of using the
word glibly. Still, metaphors are there precisely to extend the range of words,
to allow us to use them where they both do *and* do not signify what we
previously agreed they signified.

I produce texts based on procedures and algorithms similar to those in Charles
B's splendid list. The use of such procedures is of course not new, but in this
(the network) context we should be much more aware of the tools now available
which allow us to make literary experiments using such techniques in 'real
time'. Until recently we've known about these procedures and when we've felt
ludic we've sat down with siccors and paste. Now, with a little more trouble,
you can learn a simple programming language and do the same. But once you've
done this, the process of compostion, perhaps of writing itself has shifted to a
new site. With a machine I can get feedback from the results of my procedures
quick enough to adjust them according to non-arbitrary criteria. I can make my
algorithms 'learn' more about the given texts and/or my responses to them. I can
re-write the given texts so that they are better modulated by the algorithms.
This is similar to experimental processes, isn't it? Finally, and importantly, I
can provide suitably equipped readers with
as-it-happens-but-never-the-same-twice performances of the procedures which they
can 'read' on their own screens.

All I can say is why so? I do not feel that I am making a pointless gesture.
Even if all that was obtainable from such procedures was a more liberated
approach to the literary experience, they would still be worthwhile. Personally
I believe they are adequate compostional strategies with the potential to
produce significant art.

I do undertake these (?) experiments in all seriousness. I compose the
algorithms and choose or write the underlying texts. I intend to produce
something that is fascinating, perhaps beautiful, and that has significant
content. Apart from the form and content of the resulting texts themselves, I
believe the processes are of theoretical interest (even when using very simple
algorithims such as those in Charles' list) in relation to questions of
_Language as Choice and Chance_ (title of a book on mathematical grammars by G.
Herdan), and the nature of meaning (it's strange resistance to semi-arbitrary
processes). If it doesn't work, I can go back to the writing board. It is
precisely the late date of this practice that allows me to develop it in this
way.

But why wait for spring? Here (see below) is the occasion, this very
January. A read-in & a cook-in, with hilaritas as m.c.-- should you want
to haul veritable ass out of virtual land & over here to Nueva
Albania. _Pace_ the dis- & in-corpserations, the hackedemias & medias,

some places for people to stay for a couple of nights, and may be able
to offer some "gas money". If you are interested in presenting your
work and presence, please contact us as soon as possible (i.e.  RSVP)
via phone (518-442-4398) or mail (c/o Belle Gironda 730 Morris St.

        John Cayley is under the impression that seriousness is
rather like intent, some soulful condition that one adopts at the
moment of rolling the dice or whatever. Wittgenstein's cogent argument
on intent, I believe, applies here as well.

        Seriousness rather is a matter of consequences.  To be
sure, any one who finds algorithmic and aleatory modes of creation
useful should use them.  I find them useful a pedagogical tools,
generally for the purpose of un-educating people who have learned
wrong-headed lessons too well.

        Likewise, I think the kind of poem practiced by the official
verse culture might be important for personal use, such as
therapy, for example. There is a vast amount of personal material
that might be usefully made objective by poetic means.  (The
young man who held a course in Greek culture here in Albany
hostage this week believed that the police were embedding computer
chips in his penis.  Obviously, he needed to call attention to
this fact, and he used a gun.  In less extreme cases a certain
kind of writing might serve as well.)

No. I agree that seriousness is not a function of intent (I cringe
anglophilially at the thought of shifting Yi Ching stalks with a heavy frown of
high-mindedness) and I apologize if I introduced that confusion. Yes,
seriousness is a consequence of the work and consequent to its publication. The
author has no particular priviledge in determining its seriousness.

But these questions skirt around the point I was trying to make. Given the
existence of machines which are capable of reordering works of literature,
certain writers will wish to use the techniques newly made available to extend
their range of compositional strategies. The familiar algorithmic and aleatory
techniques are natural starting points but the degree of control and level of
feedback which the new tools provide changes the nature of the operation. It is
less like a liberating game and more like the painful work of composition. It is
a type of practice that should not be dismissed and which will, I believe
produce important literary works in the fullness of time.

(This is not to say that I'm not happy to play the game as light-heartedly as
anyone else, by the way :-)

In-Reply-To:  Message of Thu, 15 Dec 1994 21:39:39 -0500 from
              <au462@CLEVELAND.FREENET.EDU>

This message, intended for the list, had the
consequence of going directly to luigi-bob.
Now it has another consequence.  /SE


----------------------------Original message----------------------------

I'm actually unfamiliar with the Literary
Network, i.e. what it does and how well,
but I'm assured by someone who spoke with
their office last week that it does exist
and that they are working on defending the
NEA/NEH come the next round of assaults
(possibly as early as January).

The phone number is 217-941-9110, and the
person to speak with Ann Burke (though that
spelling may be wrong, I've only heard the
name).  I'm told it's best to call after one
in the afternoon.  (The LN shares the phone
line, btw, with the Coucil of Literary
Magazines and Publishers).

Does the NEA contribute "all that much to
non-mainstream culture," as luigi-bob puts it?
A *very* large number of the books in my poetry
library acknowledge NEA support of one form
or another, so my answer would have to be yes.

But when I originally raised to issue, it was
with the intent of generating discussion on how
the next round of debate on the program could
be framed so that maintenance of a biased and
unresponsive system was *not*
our only option/position.  Very simply, it can't
be changed if it ain't there--we need to argue
for the elimination of what's wrong with the current
program, not the program itself.

Reading over the language of the act this afternoon,
I was struck by the seventh clause:
   "The practice of art and the study of the humanities
requires constant dedication and devotion.  While no
government can call a great artist or scholar into
existence, it is necessary and appropriate for the
Federal Government to help create and sustain not only
a climate encouraging freedom of thought, imagination,
and inquiry but also the material conditions facilitating
the release of this creative talent."

It seems to me that we should be able to work with
claims like that.  No?

   Dear rodger--I am finally done with this "hellish" semester and no
   longer consider dealing with the "internal enemy" a luxury but a
   necessity. Anyway, what is lacking from this discussion for the most
   part seems to be poetry. I don't mean as artifact (THOUGH EVEN THAT
   WOULD BE REFRESHING) but a "poetic intelligence" that can inform the
   discussions. Though I am not the only one who can be seen as having
   tried to crush IT the few the times the discussion at least seemed
   to move tentatively towards it (AND I definitely owe rodger kamanetz
   an apology on this count).
   WHAT KAMENETZ brought up--the question of not worrying about a "them"
   (which to some extent is what Charles Alexander and maybe Steve Evans
    too) NEED NOT BE EMBRACED IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE to be an effective
   counter to what Don Byrd calls "the prose of thought" that has been
   manifested here. Without it, aren't we just yakking opiners??? Even
   with it we might be, but at least it might be more "fun" (and I say
   "fun" where others might say more "spiritual")
   WHAT IS KEEPING an open mind entail??? Being wishy-washy? Wavering
   between politics-as-politics and politics-as-poetry as a starting
   point of the meditation and not really worrying how or where it goes
   as long as it's intense???
   Attitudes cancel each other out.
   Turning back to a DISCOURSE of politics either out of guilt, the feeling
   you're missing out on something, feeling too lopsided, or even pissed off
   at genuine disenfranchisement may be absolutely necessary at times
   But it too is no answer (and can reify into so much primping posturing)
   As if consciousness moves through trite seasons
   And the second you name something it stops
   (OOH, OOH, IDEOLOGICAL DODGE, refusal to implicate one's INEVITABLE
    partaking in a bourgeois ideology--arrest him even though no one
    will marry him because he doesn't make enough money)
   But the desire to "divvy" consciousness up into characters is one thing
   both theorists (critics) and lyric poets deny---This is a denial they
   have in common, unless we read poetry as a novelist would (which we can)
   and see WORDS, ideas, images, gestures, whathaveyou as characters...
   And this should free us to live "inconsistenly" by theory's standards...
   (of course, you're not suppossed to SAY THIS ON THE PAGE, only on your
    tombstone, and even then only if you're FRANK O'HARA)

     Question: IS "identity" limitingly singular in "poetry" (insofar
     as it problematizes identity at all), as limitingly singular as
     it has been invoked in much of these "hot" internet debates?
     Aren't the debates with others the debates we have with
     ourselves? And if they don't always take the form of debates with
     ourselves, why do they have to with others??
     Certainly one can communicate without being contentious???
     I for one have overdosed on my own weakness for contention.
     Granted, it was a useful tool to go "beyond" the sickness of
     those "superficial mutual admiration societies" most of us probably
     couldn't stand...
     But the need to DISTINGUISH oneself has eclipsed the potential
     use value of what has been said, meanings tangled up in the messanger-
     Perhaps I'm projecting all of this and certainly don't wish for the
     discussion to degenerate into a forum on the psychoanalytic model of
     interiority or subjectivity. For "interiority" and "exteriority" are
     "the same" on a level that can not be utterly ghettoized without
     "burn baby burn" coming down from Harlem to Wall Street (or C=o=m=
     p=u=t=e=r=l=a=n=d), and the discourse of "curved space" is pasta
     or "game" for the poet...
     Or we could destroy something before it's built...
     (Because destruction can't tear itself down, strictly speaking)
     And sometimes WE HAVE TO LET OURSELVES GO---and that's been the
     MAIN VALUE of this poetic list as I see it, but is it enough to
     meet here only anarchically, To release TENSION here only to build
     it up in our more intense "heightened commodity laboratory solitude"
     where one churns out one's latest poetic/theory works????
     It's like someone who goes public dishevelled and only dresses up
     when there's no place to go. It might as well be the other way around.
     Either way, we're victims of compartmentalization, or am i making
     a mountain out of molehill???

What Chris writes about identity can be blamed (in part) for spawning this
little cadenza around a desire to be able to have (hold of) multiple channels
of perception at once and without moving.  It occurs to me that the
one-at-a-timeness of perception (maybe a mere matter of faulty programming
we've had) may have yielded this curious habit of thinking of approximately
one thing at a time.  It isn't that the mind does not feel full (at moments),
but that bringing together a full house in large measure means doing
harmonics or skipping stones or something.  Thus (getting back to where this
started), we let out one moment of thought and then another patch of the
mosaic (someone else) recites this other moment of thought, from perhaps a
completely different context.  On and on.  The psychoanalytic wealth behind
all this is something I can't touch (but I can love!).  So there you have it.
 One more granule!

this message, intended for Steve, had the
consequence of going directly to him.
now it has another consequence...  lbd

steve--

first off, yes i suppose, _any_ gov't asstistance fr the arts
ought be welcomed, scarce as it is...  _i_ sure wouldn't look _that_
gift horse in th mouth.  & sure, it's gotta be there first if we're
gonna improve it.  and the claims you quote are certainly laudable...

BUT the evidince I see in support of those claims is meager.
some fine books in my library do indeed credit the NEA, but
the vast majority do not--either they are commericially
viable (more or less) on their own, or some sucker like
myself has put them out themselves.

i guess i'm thinking of the opening of Chas B's "provisional
institutions" essay: "imagine that all the nationally circulated
magazines and all the trade presses and all the university presses
in the US stopped publishing or reviewing poetry.  new poetry
in the US would hardly feel the blow."... i guess i'd add,
what if the NEA just blew away...

and contrary-wise, i believe i remember Cydney Chadwick bemoaning
the loss of NEA funds for AVEC--almost seemed that the _loss_ of
that chimerical funding had such a negative impact  (psychologicaly
as much as fiscally) that it offset the original positive affect
of _being_ funded.  and i believe the loss of NEA funds was one
(not the only) of the death-nells for Segue...

all that said, glad the Lit Network is still at it, appologies
for misunderstanding/misinformation i might have spread, and
hoping they might be of real assistance.  but sceptical.

Dear John,
         You sound, you know, like one who has not yet discovered the
pleasures of reading Cage or Mac Low.  As if to say, this is for the
FUTURE.  The future you are here looking at is called 1958 or
thereabouts.  It's not  new and its "techniques", by which I suppose
you mean, following sets of predetermined instructions (or
self-instructions) for text-manipulations, (even including dice-throwing
in the instructions!!!  tut! tut!....) produce results which are of no
interest whatever until shown to someone else, or read aloud in a
public place.  Or sung or used as if it were instrumental cha-cha-cha
music....   At that precise moment, there is a relation between
poet reading and "Audience" that is a pleasure to engage with.  /for
one thing it pulls the rug from under A NUMBER OF OTHER VERY
HIGH-MINDED proposals.

             And a Merry Christmas to you and yours

Electronic Poetry Center
---------------------------
Call for Papers / Essays
---------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The ELECTRONIC POETRY CENTER is interested in receiving papers, essays
on poetics, specific postmodern poets, or movements, etc.

The EPC contains an author library where we would consider placing
these papers. How would this work? Papers will bear a copyright
statement in your name. The idea is to make information available to
readers who are interested in these topics, and allow them an
accessible source to receive them.

For papers on specific authors, a subject library will also be
created.

Our idea is that papers presented at conferences, for example, often
contain timely information that might be shared.  Regardless of
whether these papers are being revised or otherwise prepared for print
publication, you might wish to submit them for placement into the EPC
Library for others to read, view, even comment on if you wish.

Another possiblity here might be your own essays that you use for
classroom use (and which you own the copyright to).  Students may
receive them from the Center at no cost and from any telephone outlet
they may choose.

Placement of papers on the EPC would not in any way preclude their
publication in print, in a collection of essays, etc. Our idea is to
allow them to circulate while the ideas are fresh.

There has been quite a bit of traffic in the Electronic Poetry Center.
This is a way of helping your material to circulate and also of
providing interesting material for our visitors.

If you are interested in submitting work to this project, send them
in the body of an e-mail message to Loss Glazier,
lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu

We are most interested in hearing from you!

Just a note to clear up a misconception that could arise from Luigi-Bob's
post.  Neither AVEC nor Syntax Projects for the Arts has ever received a
grant from the NEA.  Every year, we apply.  Every year, we're turned
down.  We have received grants from the California Arts Council, the
Fund for Poetry, the Mellon Foundation (for 'organizational development')
the Coordinating Council of Literary Magazines and Presses, and several
smaller foundations.  But most of the annual income comes from members of
Syntax Projects for the Arts--people who contribute at least $25 a year
(and often more).  (Information on Syntax Projects and membership is
included at the end of this post.)  The reason given by the NEA is that
the work in AVEC is of 'uneven' artistic merit.  I'm not sure what 'even'
artistic content would be...

On the record, I would like to say how much I really love the NEA and the
great work they do.

-----------------


                SYNTAX PROJECTS FOR THE ARTS


Syntax Projects for the Arts is a non-profit 501(c)(3),
member-supported organization dedicated to the promotion of
literature for the public benefit.  Our focus is on formally
innovative writing.

AVEC MAGAZINE
Since 1989, Syntax has published _Avec_, a journal of
poetry, prose and translations.  _Avec_'s interest is
international, and we have published writing and art from
the United States, Canada, Lebanon, England, France,
Germany, Eastern Europe, and Russia.

AVEC BOOKS
In 1993, Syntax started Avec Books with the publication of
Peter Gizzi's _Periplum_.  A second book, David Bromige's _A
Cast of Tens_ was published in the spring of 1994. Last month,
Avec Books published  _Blue Vitriol_, the first
English language collection by the Russian poet Aleksei
Parshchikov, translated by Michael Palmer, John High,
Michael Molnar and others, with an introduction by Marjorie
Perloff.

WITZ
Members of Syntax Projects for the Arts also receive _Witz_,
a journal of critical writing.

MEMBERSHIPS
Syntax has received grants from the California Arts Council,
the Council of Literary Magazines and Presses, and the
Andrew Mellon Foundation. But it is primarily supported by
individual members.

Annual membership rates are $25 (member), $50 (supporting),
$100 (sustaining), $200 (patron), $500 (angel).

Members receive two issue of Avec, three issues of Witz, and
a 25% discount on Avec Books.

Avec is also available by subscription ($12 / 2 issues).

Memberships and correspondence to Syntax Projects for the
Arts should be sent to:

Syntax Projects for the Arts
P.O. Box 1059

The joke about the weather forecast is that it has been made quite clear
by meteorology itself that the farther away from the moment of the
initial conditions the less chance the forecast has of being correct. For
me the interesting issue is the separation of information from meaning
that arises from such methods as forecasting. Clearly the news is faulty
by virtue of the selection process and doubly so when you consider the
point of view. My note about the weather being news is that its at least
no more than it pretends to be, a guess. But how long would you stay in
your job if you were wrong as often as the weatherman.

As we deal with more and more complexities, the more we have to settle
for simultaneous answers.

An interesting political gesture would be to automate the sending of the
message "Foetus" to Newt's e-mail address, so that he would receive
thousands of messages a day. Then see if he wants to save the message.

Pat,

There has been some switching over of the system (as we've discussed)
and are now just sorting out the few snags that remain.

Does this change cause a difficulty for you?

It is easy enough if you'd prefer to reset it to how it was before.
There was only some confusion as to other menus.

Let me know; I can get in there and change within 24 hours (or
immediately) if this is your strong preference.

I await word from you.

Sending you best wishes,

Loss

I thought that since I shared my previous post will all of you, you may as
well know its meaning.

The Segue Newsletter, as you know has been posted for some time on the
Electronic Poetry Center at Buffalo - a fine service to us all I may add.
Up until a certain point I was able to access this Hypertext newsletter via
an address on the EPC computer. This address or Uniform Resource Locator
(URL) was :

gopher://writing.upenn.edu/hh/internet/library/e-journals/ub/rift/journals/l
ist/Segue/Segue_Newsletter

The current and correct one is:

gopher://writing.upenn.edu/hh/internet/library/e-journals/ub/rift/journals/s
elected/Segue/Segue_Newsletter

What this means is that anyone who wishes to reach the Segue online
Newsletter may do so by imputting this string address (or URL) either via
gopher or by using a WWW browser such as Mosaic.

I apologize for any confusion that I may have caused anyone.

To our foreign friends,

Newt Gingrich is the next Speaker of the House, the first Republican
(capital R) to hold the post in 40 years.A onetime college professor
(history I think), he represents Cobb County, Georgia, the northern
suburbs of Atlanta. Atlanta's one of the few truly cosmopolitan cities
in the South (New Orleans and Houston are the others) and has had
African American political leadership for some 15 or so years. Cobb
County is where the "white flight" there flew and Newt is its political
expression.

He made his rep in Congress as a brash anti-liberal practitioner of
guerrilla electoral politics. The "bomb thrower" reference speaks to his
general style (the American cartoon Doonesbury depicts him as a bomb,
actually the "system bomb" icon from the Macintosh GUI). He recently
declared that one "senior law enforcement official" told him that one
fourth of the Clinton administation's senior officials had drug
problems. That sort of thing.

Prior to the most recent general election, Newt announced a Republican
"Contract with America," a series of items they hope to get through
Congress in the first 100 days of 1995. Mostly a rehash of Reagan-era
ideas (prayer in the schools, a balanced budget amendment, term
limits for congress, more money for the military).

Many people here expect Newt to actively seek to end the funding for the
NEA and the NEH. My guess is that he has the votes to do it. Or at least
to turn the $$ back to the states, a good number of which would then
kill it at that level.

But Newt is a bit of a wirehead, a personal pal of Alvin Toffler's. He's
promised to get all of Congress up on email and the internet. Sort of
the right wing's answer to Al Gore. (What is the left wing answer to Al
Gore?)

Coppertales: A Journal of Rural Arts

'Coppertales' is a journal of 180 pages edited by Brian Musgrove and Chris
Lee and currently published in the form of an annual anthology by the
Faculty of Arts at the University of Southern Queensland and the University
of Southern Queensland Press.  In 1995 it has been supported by the
Queensland Government through the Minister for the Arts.

'Coppertales' publishes poetry, short fiction, articles, art work, reviews
and interviews which feature the rural experience.  Its aim is to provide a
space for the representation and promotion of Queensland and Australian
rural culture.  Too often rural Australia is misrepresented as a simple and
outdated cliche by interests confined to the metropolitan center.  This
journal establishes a forum for the diversity of interests and opinion
which are characteristic of this country's regional cultures.

'Coppertales' is not exclusively committed to regional items.  It
recognises that rural people are just as interested in the ideas and values
of metropolitan and international cultures as they in those of their own
localities.  'Coppertales' will publish metropolitan work of quality which
may be of interest to a rural audience.

The inaugural issue of the journal features poetry from Bruce Dawe, Coral
Hull, Megan Redfern, and Mark Mahemoff, short fiction from Ness Shannon,
Ian Crowther and H. Hayes, a travel essay from Pat Buckridge, and an
interview with Thomas Keneally.

Contributors receive a complimentary copy of the journal and all
contributions are refereed through an editorial advisory board.
Subscriptions are Aust$12 (Aust$20 for institutions) overseas subscriptions
$Aus20 per annum and are available from the Department of Humanities,
Faculty of Arts, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba 4350.
Cheque, Money Order, Bankcard, Visacard and Mastercard are all accepted.

Subject:      Great Poet

The new issue of Conjunctions (#23: "New World Writing") arrived
yesterday, a total translation issue, and in it is a poet whose work
simply takes my breath away: ARAKI YASUSADA. According to Brad Morrow's
intro to the issue, it's Yasusada's first publication in English
translation.

Here's one poem (picked for its brevity):

TELESCOPE WITH URN

The image of the galaxies spreads out like a cloud of sperm.

Expanding said the observatory guide, and at such and such velocity.

It is like the idea of the flowers, opening within the idea of the
flowers.

I like to think of that, said the monk, arranging them with his papery
fingers.

Tiny were you, and squatted over a sky-colored bowl to make water.

What a big girl! cried we, tossing you in the general direction of the
stars.

Intently, then, in the dream, I folded up the great telescope on Mount
Horai.

In the form of this crane, it is small enough for the urn.

(translated by Tosa Motokiyu, Ojiu Norinaga and Okura Kyojin)

Yasusada (1907-72) was a Hiroshima postal clerk most of his life and,
while active in Japanese avant-garde circles, basically remained
unknown. His wife and eldest daughter died instantly in the atomic bomb
blast in 1945. A second daughter died of radiation sickness three years
later. His manuscripts were brought to light when they were discovered
by his surviving son (who was out of town with relatives that fateful
day in '45). Apparently his major influences were Roland Barthes and
Jack Spicer (!) and the selection in CONJUNCTIONS includes "Sentences
for Jack Spicer Renga" (collaboratively written with Akutagawa Fusei).
At the time of his death he was at work on a series of letters and
translations to have been called After Spicer.

There's an elevation of tone in these poems that reminds me more of
Michael Palmer than Spicer, perhaps because the translators are all
Hiroshima poets (one of whom seems to spend half of each year in
Sebastapol, although I don't know if he's known to Bromige or to Cydney
Chadwick). These works kept me up last night and probably will again for
another night or three. I recommend them highly.

Also in the issue are works by Bei Dao, Nina Iskrenko, Eduardo Galeano,
Anne-Marie Albiach (collab. w/ Charles Bernstein!), Pascale Monnier
(trans. by Ashbery) and much more. You can get a copy by sending $10 US
to Conjunctions, Bard College, Anondale-on-Hudson, NY 12504.

I have taken my literary pleasure of both authors although I've never heard them
in performance. I've already acknowledged the fact that the principles and
practices of aleatory and algorithmic works are not new.

Anyway enough parrying _ad hominems_ (too many of these in listserv discussions
don't you think?). The point is that the general availablility of tools --
hardware and software -- to appreciate this work fully, and so to develop it in
a way that involves the responses of active readers, is only just with us. What
_is_ new?

- A new kind of _literary_ experience. The experience of such work has typically
been either in performance (there's a lot to that I know), or in the reading of
a single edited and/or printed 'snapshot' of text resulting from the application
of a process. Such work, when presented as a program-plus-display allows a new
kind of literary (usually lone, silent reading) experience of a generated text,
_as it is generated_.

- The reader is in more in control and is a part of the process. The reader can
set the process running again, interrupt it, investigate its workings. With more
developed works, the reader 'holds, throws and loads the dice' -- is able to
change the weightings of aleatory factors, choose processes to be applied to a
text, modify processes, 'teach' the work about new text or responses to texts,
finally even perhaps spawn a so-called 'genetic' evolution of processes (as in
'genetic programming').

- The notion of composition is extend to include the composition of the
processes and, I would argue, the programs that underlie them in machine-based
work.

In the UK, I am not aware of anyone developing what I've recently begun to call
'machine modulated poetries' (MaMoPo? :-)

Those programs and works which I have so far discovered from US sources are
either ungrounded -- willfully or otherwise -- in innovative contemporary
writing or are more concerned with the presentation of poetic language using the
techniques of non-literary media. (This is one reason why I've stressed the
_literary_ nature of experience -- we shouldn't abandon our particular muse
simply because our word processors have learned to paint and sing.)

I would be anxious to be put in touch with anyone else who is working in this
way.

i have been reading around in several hypertexts distributed by
Eastgate Systems (134 Main St., Watertown MA, 02172, USA), in
both StorySpace (their cross-platorm hypertext environment) and
HyperCard.
            the "quality" is varied--or praps i'll say "some of
these has been of more use to me than others"--
                                               or praps i'll try
to recast the "experimental" arguement: i'd rather call these
hypertexts "experimental apparatuses" which i, as "reader", use
to conduct "experiments".  some of these experimental setups
enable me to produce "useful reading experiences"--& sometimes,
those that i fail to "successfuly" utilize provide insight into
why they have "failed", and thus how another setup might "succeed".

at anyrate... Mary-Kim Arnold's "Lust", and Jane Yellowlees Douglas'
"I hHave Said Nothing" (both from Eastgate Quarterly review of
Hypertext, vol. 1 #2), have given me some useful reading experi-
ences.  i'm looking forward to seeing how folks might put the WWW
environment to simlar use...


& yeah praps someone will try to apply my recasting of this "arguement"
to non-hypertextual poetry, and either find it useful or no... i'd
be interested to hear of the results of such an test...

Subject:      Armand Schwerner

I've been eavesdropping on this list for the better part of a year
now, much to my edification, without having up until now felt the
need to join in on the ongoing discourse(s).  Or maybe not having
felt it proper to do so? since I don't write poetry myself, only
write about it (& if the truth be known, don't so much write about
it as aspire to do so).  Whatever, I've been quite satisfied to
read along passively, treating the list as a superior kind of daily
news-feed.  But now I need some specific information, & I'm hoping
you-all out there might be able to help me out.  I've wanted for
some time to write something about Armand Schwerner's "The
Tablets," & it seems as though this winter I might manage to get to
it, but I'm amazed to find that (as far I can make out) essentially
nothing has been written about that poem and/or Schwerner.  Amazed,
because I find "The Tablets" really attractive & unprecedented --
a FUNNY long-poem; funnier (because more serious?) than, say, Koch?
something like David Jones with a (Jewish?) sense of humor?  Or
have I missed some essential publication on Schwerner?  Has one of
you out there written something about Schwerner and/or "The
Tablets" that I've overlooked?  Do you know of something worth
reading about him/it?  I wouldn't mind blazing the trail on this,
but I'd sure like to know if anyone's been there ahead of me.  I've
Rounded Up all the Usual Suspects, e.g., Perloff, but they seem not to have
looked Schwerner's way even once.  I just learned that  Sherman  Paul once
published some kind of pamphlet on Schwerner which I'll have to track down.
But is there anything else I should be looking for?

Brian--
I can't answer your query, though I feel like I've heard something just
in the last year about someone writing on "The Tablets"--maybe (?) in a
job application letter for the opening here at Arizona?  I'd be surprised
if there wasn't an issue, or 1/2 issue, on Schwerner in VORT back in the
late sixties or the seventies.  Anyway Jerry Rothenberg would probably
know (is he on this list?) or Toby Olson at Temple, or George Economou at
Oklahoma.  Also there may be some short stuff on the early Tablets back
in Caterpillar.
good luck, I'll be curious what you find and also about what you make of
that strange piece of work.

For: Brian McHale in particular.

It's curious to see the work of Schwerner come up as so much of a mystery.
He is now & has been for many years one of the very singular & original
contributors to the opening & freeing up of poetry.  Some good writing
about his work -- with the TABLETS as central focus -- has certainly
appeared (the Sherman Paul piece and a recent one by Ed Sanders are two
that I can quickly think of) but, as with too many others, hardly commen-
surate with what he's given us.  The omission of Schwener & the monumental
(and -- you're right -- deeply comic) TABLETS from all three recent
anthologies of OUR poetry is bewildering & -- to my mind at least --
dampens some of the real pleasure they have given me.  (Pierre Joris and I
will try to compensate for that in the big global book we're still
compiling [second volume the post-World War II] but there are limits even
so ...)

If you want to be in touch with Schwerner -- who I would guess keeps track
of all these things -- his address is 20 Bay St. Landing, Apt. B3C, Staten
Island, NY 10301, tel. (718) 442-3784, fax (718) 448-7935.  I know he'll be
happy to hear from you.

With greetings for the year ahead

I realize that this is an abrupt change of pace, but. . .
In order to finish a paper on Du Bois and Marx, I need to track down
what appears a very odd and fractured allusion in Du Bois.  I believe
that he is rewriting the "Song of the Bride," as he calls it from Lohengrin,
Act III, Scene I, when he has the black John in "The Coming of John,"
in *Souls* sing "Freudig gefuhrt, ziehet dahin."  Sorry I can't do umlauts,
and I guess I should somehow apologize for the preciousness of this
query.
Still, lacking a libretto and out here in Detroit (not your big
opera town) on Christmas day, what better source than the poetry net?
I tried my Oxford and Harvard Opera Guides, but I think a recording or
libretto would answer this real quick.  I will eat my recording of *Rienzi*
if it ain't from Lohengrin.  Thanks for what help or sympathy you might
render.  Cheers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Not sure just what the question is, but yes, the German phrase in Chapter 13
of _Souls of Black Folk_ comes from _Lohengrin_, which is pretty clear in
context since this is the opera John attends in New York, where he has his
improbable meeting with the other John from back home ("white John," son of
the judge).  When he hears the opera in New York, as Du Bois tells us, "black
John" rises "out of the dirt and dust of that low life that held him prisoned
and befouled."  Soon after, however, the usher asks him to leave his seat; he
catches sight of the other John and his life is changed forever.  He leaves
New York immediately and returns to the small Southern town he'd previously
avoided returning to.  Here, in a truly Poe-esque manner, Du Bois dramatizes
his own concept of "double conciouscness."  Indeed, the description of the
opera's effect on John recalls (with certain critical differences) Du Bois's
own recollection in Chapter I of the freedom he sought from racism while
growing up:  "Then it dawned upon me with a certain suddenness that I was
different from the others; or like, mayhap, in heart and life and longing, but
shut out from their world by a vast veil....  I held all beyond it in common
contempt, and lived above it in a region of blue sky and great wandering
shadows.  That sky was bluest when I could beat my mates at examination-time,
of beat them at a foot-race, or even beat their stringy heads."

Anyway, back to _Lohengrin_:  At chapter's end, when John is lynched, he
escapes in his mind back North, "humming `Song of the Bride'."  The German
Du Bois gives, "Freudig gefuehrt, ziehet dahin," means literally "Joyfully
led, draw thither."  I believe the verb tense for "ziehet dahin" indicates
an address to the plural form of thou--something Du Bois would have known
(he spent a year in Germany, where he heard Max Weber lecture).  The note in
the back of my edition of _Souls_ says Du Bois substituted "freudig"
(joyfully) for "treulich" (faithfully), but I'm not sure of the significance.
More than likely he was quoting from memory.  The complexity of Du Bois's
address in _Souls_ is such that one wants to think about just who this plural
you is to whom John hums as the judge and his lynching party approach.

In any case, very curious how Du Bois's "fractured reference" (as you say) to
Wagner relates to Du Bois's Marxism.  Perhaps you could share some of your
thoughts on this.

Yes, Du Bois actually spent two years+, long enough to do all the work for
his doctorate in sociology.  I know that the passage is from Lohengrin, but
I couldn't find the passage as such in Lohengrin, and the substitution means
something more stunning than bad memory, I'd bet.  I am still jamming on this
paper, so I can't explain the Marx reference.  It'd be the paper, I guess.
But I can say that I am about unwinding some of the stunning moments of
bubblings up of German philosophy and music in Du Bois's text.  His use
or abuse of Lohengrin was actually just a footnote or epigraph to his
treatment of two letters Karl Marx wrote, one to Abraham Lincoln the
other to Andrew Johnson.  This is sketchy, I know, but what I wanted
in order to pencil in one part of the picture was the exact passage from
Lohengrin and why/how he had fractured, as I put it, the "Bride's Song,"
or "Song of the Bride," as Du Bois thought he had fused the Bridal Chorus and
the scene right after the death of Telramund.  I am not sure that it matters
a whole lot, and this might just be the way I have of warming up to
a more straightforward approach to Du Bois's fascinating strategies of
historical and genealogical revisionism.  He makes Marx the pupil of
Frederick Douglass; he manages to lynch (at least in a sort of far fetched
way) his German education and his ambivalence to German culture by
putting that weird or at least inappropriate and dramatically implausible
song in John's throat.  These moments, rich in all sorts of ways, fascinate
me.  I know the DuBois text well; and when I go back to some of his
sources, I getthe uncanny sense that he was just as weird a quoter as, say,
Pound.  Sorry for the length of this message.  I'm sure that not everyone
gets pulled into or laughs as hard as I do at this sort of stuff. FIN.
But I'd still like the first couple of lines--in German--of the aforementioned
Wagner tunes.  Happy, etc.

Sounds great--tell us more when you get further along.  The opening two lines
(but this is all my edition gives) are "Treulich gefuehrt, ziehet dahin / Wo
euch der Segen der Liebe bewahr"--"Faithfully led, draw thither / Where over
you the blessings of love keep watch."  Robert Bernasconi is also working on
Du Bois's response to German philosophy, by way of a reading of (I seem to
recall) "The Conservation of the Races," but hasn't yet published anything.

below is the book announcement.  slowly slowly slowly catching up with such
projects, will finally be ready to do some reading soon.  soon.

                announcing a new series of books

     ". . . it erases the borders, slips through the hands, you
can barely hear it, but it teaches us the heart.  Filiation,
token of election confided as legacy, it can attach itself to any
word at all, to the thing, living or not, to the name of
herisson, for example . . ."

     --Derrida, "Che cos'e la poesia?" ("What Is Poetry?")

     "`Are _herisson_--_herissons_ messengers like eagles?'
`Like what, Rose-of-the-Alps?'  `Are _herissons_, I mean, mixed
up like eagles with stories out of Greek books?'  Now Doctor
Berne Blum was an odd sort of person.  Most people laughed when
you asked them questions . . . or said, `Little girls shouldn't
ask such things' . . . or pretended not to have heard, and talked
about something else or just went out and whispered (rather
loudly) behind closed doors, `Now what does one tell a child
about such matters?'  Doctor Berne Blum wasn't like any of these
people.  He said:  `Little Rose-of-the-Alps, that is a most
important question.'"

Actually, Tony, I thought of a better, shorter response to the question

Do they celebrate Kwanzaa in New Zealand?

Schwerner collaborated with someone (?) on something called
"The Domesday Book" in the early sixties. It was a lexicon
of nuclear weaponry - perhaps one of the earliest attempts
to wring some humor from the arms race. It's quite an
interesting - and still hilarious - work. I have a copy at
home, and will send additional details tomorrow.

I dug out my copy of the Schwerner "Domesday Dictionary"
last night and found when I called it "hilarious" I gravely
misspoke, unless your idea of hilarity runs toward the
gallows. In fact the book is horrifying. Not having picked
it up in several years, I remembered it being a great deal
more comic than it is. It IS, certainly, funny, but not the
sort of funny that you can easily laugh at. It is
nonetheless an incredibly powerful book. I'd like to know
more about the history of this book - both its making and
its reception.

In any case, the details are:

The Domesday Dictionary, Being An Inventory of the Artifacts
and Conceits of a New Civilization

I remember seeing The Domesday Dictionary @ Cody's throughout the middle
1960s and never associated it with the poet I later came to know through
the Tablets until Michael Andre used copious excerpts in The Poets'
Encyclopedia (Unmuzzled Ox Vol IV No V/Vol V, 1979)--some 26 entries.

During the 60s and even AFTER the Encyclopedia, my imagination always
rewrote that book's title to The Doomsday Dictionary. It wasn't until
your post sent me back to the Encyclopedia that I realized my error.

Here's my question: Why ISN'T it called the Doomsday Dictionary?

Ron Silliman asks about the provenance of teh Domesday book. It was a record
  of a survey completed for William the Conqueror in 1086. Nothing to do with
doomsday as far as I can tell.  But like Schwerner's work, I gather, an
"inventory of the artifacts" of a civilization.
