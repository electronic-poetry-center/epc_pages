David,

Absolutely brilliant post! A few ad hoc reactions:

"In a sense, alotof visual poetry has nothing to do with visuality,
looking, seeing, movements of the eyes in examining attentively the field
and peripheries of the visual as a notation of sonic transmissions from out
the cracks as it were of the walls--the sounds of colors, colors of sounds,
--al of this is eschewed in much Visual Poetry of the kind Jim is writing
about in favor of what is a process not of looking, but of reading."

Yes, the visual as a movement of the eye (the seeing itself) where frames
disappear, while peripheries become empowered (like in a photograph). Also,
yes, the *totality* of seeing (like the cinema).

"examining attentively the field
and peripheries of the visual as a notation of sonic transmissions from out
the cracks as it were of the walls--the sounds of colors, colors of sounds,"

A kind of Stendhal Syndrome. Visual poetry. Inherently unstable,
vertiginous, in constant need of rebuilding itself.

"I think the uses of the virtual, of images which are there only via
electricity--begins to decay the visual as a seeing, looking, with materials
that exist physically, and whose movements in time and through spaces are
effected by an immense number of continauly shifting phenomena--the weather
being one of them.  In the virtual real, the eye does not need to be as
developing in looking "into" time and space, because there is less affecting
the image,  This virtual image becomes as it were "still"

In visual poetry what is on the page needs to be independent (as the subject
before the lens is independent from the photographer).
Did you see the film *Decasia*?

"This creates an art which exists in the
act of looking's looking--there is no "object" produced, there is no
"concept" expressed, there is no "trace" of this other than what exists for
Smithson as a reality which is as durable as any sculpture, written poem,
machine, etc"

The visual creates its own line/motion.

""solidifying" a text within a "stopped time" whose movements are done as
"readings" rather than as the art of looking. "

The movements of the eyes must be potentially chaotic, creating its own
eros.

"in a visual poem all the elements are treated as equals in terms of their
opening to possiblities--, -that is to say--a color, a line, a dot, a form ,
the texture of the surfaces,"

The same as the "democracy" in the looking at a photograph. The dominance of
a erratic/chaotic/democratic eye undercuts the previous dominance and the
autonomy (illusionary solidity) of words.

"visual poetry at least for myself works with things which exits as actual
found  materials, found letterings, fragments forms--to be involved with the
swarming teeming multiplicities which exists "before our very eyes"--
this kind of seeing requires a look /looking of far greater speed and
attention than does what one finds in the virtual and digital--where the
"framed" and stilled image is demanding instaed a "reading" within a
confiement to the aream of textuality--qua "text"--"

RuBeings (not correct spelling) are steeped in time.

Ciao,

Murat

Dear Friends of Small Press Traffic,
While somewhat nestled in our foggy beds for the summer, SPT has been
working diligently to once again create a season of programming to
amaze, mystify, inspire and delight you.


As you well know, for over 35 years SPT has been at the heart of where
experimentation and community intersect. This season we are excited to
present  what we're thinking of as a multi-pronged conversation. Components
of this conversation include: class/warfare; translation; performance, and
the Inverted I (which addresses memoir, lyric, identity).  In addition, thi=
s
season will feature the launch of *Dialogues*, talks and writing
laboratories presented by visiting readers. Our hope is that a heightened
sense of debate and investigation will ensue. You don=92t want to miss it.


Our lineup is planned as follows:

Friday, September 11, 2009 at 7:30 p.m.

CA Conrad and Frank Sherlock* on Class/Warfare*

Our Fall 2009 season will, of course, will begin after you've been wow-ed b=
y
the brilliance of Bill Luoma's Oakdish (held before and during an Oakland A=
s
game at the Oakland Coliseum)  on August 22nd, for which there are still
spaces. Visit oakdish.blogspot.com for more information or sign up at
smallpresstraffic@gmail.com.

It should go without saying that there is not better time to become a membe=
r
of SPT.  As we push to make it through another year with it's own set of
unique funding challenges, and hear of a different arts organization each
day that closes its doors, we are heartened by the fact that it is our
community that will sustain us.

If you value SPT and the incredible writers we showcase, show your support
by becoming a member (or, if you already are, by making an
additional donation) today.

I am humbled and honored to be a part of Small Press Traffic. I hope you ar=
e
too.

See you soon!
Samantha

yes, of course you're wrong and misunderstanding me, murat. what's
interesting to me 'as image' doesn't necessarily depend on new technology.
paintings seem to be more interesting to me than photography or film 'as
image'. some paintings. though there is some painterly photography and film,
also. i'm less interested in the technology of production than in what is
finally presented to me. or i like to be. sometimes the technology of
production is made to be prominent. as in holopoetry. it's usually a
consideration, in any case, mind you, isn't it.

when new tech techniques are used, it's rarely just the tech means of
production that's of interest, if it is at all. except to technologists,
possibly.

i saw a documentary some time ago about blade runner. part of the success of
the visual dimension of blade runner is that there was a long period of time
in production when the film had mostly been shot but no production--except
by the people responsible for the visuals--was going on. they had a long
time to work on it, and something to say.

i'm not sure what you mean by a digital effect, murat. these days, film is
typically edited on computers.

i've been reading about how bernie made off with billions. and saw the joker
pic of him from the cover of the new york mag. and saw pics of various other
swindlers. wow quite the run of them recently. there's reaganomics for ya.
so have been contemplating a dbcinema series on faces of swindlers.
collaging them in ways related to http://vispo.com/dbcinema/olga .
capitalism is just so fucked up. i've been reading about madoff and crew all
day. very 'american psycho' in the way he just kept going undetected or even
when detected nobody did much about it until he confessed. markopolos
sketches a sec that just was incapable of such analysis (ponzi scheme
analysis fer instance).

everybody wants a reason to believe. as in the song. which is a beautiful
thing. but the swindlers really work that 'suspension of disbelief'.

in any case, i'm hoping i can get something of this out of dbcinema. as a
collaging tool. as a cinematic tool. as a langu(im)age processor. as a thing
for 'painting' with 'brushes'.

Sad to say, Eric Hoffman's announcement that the new Big Bridge is
online was a trifle premature. Michael Rothenberg tells me it will be
a matter of a few days more. Stay tuned.

Jim,

"paintings seem to be more interesting to me than photography or film 'as
image'. some paintings. though there is some painterly photography and film,
also. i'm less interested in the technology of production than in what is
finally presented to me."

You can say that if you look at photography as a kind of painting, doing
what painting "used" to do. Photography has very little do do with painting,
nor has cinema. But technology peculiar to the medium does affect the limits
of what is presentable in it. In some way it creates its dynamic potential.

"i saw a documentary some time ago about blade runner. part of the success
of the visual dimension of blade runner is that there was a long period of
time in production when the film had mostly been shot but no
production--except by the people responsible for the visuals--was going on.
they had a long time to work on it, and something to say."

If you watch that documentary again (I am assuming it is the one attached to
the DVD), you will see most everything is dictated by the director's
specific vision, almost about every detail of the film. The art in it is a
function of bringing it about, is not independent from it.

"i'm not sure what you mean by a digital effect, murat. these days, film is
typically edited on computers."

By you defintion, Jim, almost every poem written today is a digital poem
since written on a word processor.

"n any case, i'm hoping i can get something of this out of dbcinema. as a
collaging tool. as a cinematic tool. as a langu(im)age processor. as a thing
for 'painting' with 'brushes'."

I was not suggesting that you had no thoughts you are trying to express in
your digital work.

Ciao,

Murat

Mr. Savage, you're certainly welcome.  This summer hit a high
watermark reading these Wieners poems!

MORE of his books waiting for me at the library, the Notebooks
published by Sun & Moon.  THE FILTHY USED BOOKSTORE THIEVES want 100
dollars for it!

When the newest collection of Spicer came out recently I HOPE it made
those book villains SICK in their dingy little basements of money
taken from the mouths of poets!  Double fisted GOTCHA!  NOW THE KIDS
CAN BUY SPICER AND HAVE ENOUGH LEFT OVER FOR BEER AND SMOKES!

Be safe,

A musicologist friend of mine (Ben Young) is trying to track down
information on two poets...Google has proved equally elusive....these two
poets, Ed James and Thomas Postell, are listed as having read with Amiri
Baraka, Bobb Hamilton and Cecil Taylor in 1957...see

http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22bobb+hamilton%22&scoring=a&hl=en&ned=us&um=1&sa=N&sugg=d&as_ldate=1955&as_hdate=1959&lnav=hist1

If anyone knows anything about these two writers, or has contact info for
them, it'd be great if you could pass it on to me at djk5474@gmail.com and
I'll forward that on to Ben.

thanks,

In actual practice I have come across this problem, being both an art
photographer and poet. It does seem in practice and the thinking
required, the distinction is reactionary, in the technical sense of the
word.

Gerald Genette's books on the work of art seem to address this problem.
Best, Chris Jones.

sure it makes sense
i do alot of collage
and feel that it's ovvious to me when each is what it is vispo or just
vis collages
tho all have a poetic sense embedded in them and many with a narrative no
matter how abstract or warped

Part 1 of this year's Big Bridge is now online!

=20

http://www.bigbridge.org/

=20

As usual, it includes balanced presentations of arts and genres, =
aesthetic approaches and socio-political statements, compact anthologies =
and stand-alone works.=20

=20

The issue opens with a collection of essays and examples of Slow Poetry, =
one of the leading contenders for the first major shift in 21st century =
art. Not a movement, but rather a means of approaching, rethinking, and =
appreciating virtually all modes and genres. A measure of the importance =
of this feature is that its URL got passed around before the issue =
officially went online. It thus officially appears after being mentioned =
in blogs, and even satirized by another group. In one way or another, we =
hope our features tend to be similarly ahead of the curve - at times =
going so far as to generate response before official publication.=20

=20

We do, however, try to present work that keeps response from distorting =
our environment, as we try to reclaim poetry from preconception. This =
issue's anthology of poetry and fiction from South Africa, for instance, =
makes no attempt to fill in news stories or confirm simplifications of =
huge problems and unusual successes, but present a glimpse of the =
diversity of a complex nation's poetry and the individuality of its =
writers.=20

=20

Standard features such as the continuing group statements in War Papers =
and another in the series of paintings by Jim Spitzer, judicious essays =
and terse reviews, short fiction and a suggestive sample of current =
little magazines published on paper in the digital age continue the =
scope of the magazine. A simplified table of contents appears below.=20

=20

This issue differs from its predecessors in several ways. It intersects =
with the ROCKPILE program of transcontinental readings lead by David =
Meltzer and Michael Rothenberg and including local participants.=20

=20

It also appears several months before the omnibus New Orleans anthology, =
which, in itself, is larger than everything else in the issue. Later =
this year, we will also add a compact, bi-lingual Anthology of =
Venezuelan Women poets, another tri-lingual Anthology of Galician =
writers and a few small contributions. We feel that dividing the issue =
up this way keeps the New Orleans feature from throwing the issue off =
balance and giving our readers some breathing room. Opening ROCKPILE at =
this time also gives us a chance to test the interaction of an annual =
magazine with an on-going project.=20

=20

Although we are adamant partisans in some areas, such as opposition to =
senseless wars in places the U.S. does not understand and where it does =
not belong, and in celebration of the history and resurrection of one of =
America's greatest cities, we hope to maintain enough diversity to =
present some work that will appeal to nearly anyone who looks for =
progressive poetry on the web, and perhaps promote interchange between =
people with different ideas and orientations.=20

=20

At a time when economic crisis brings out the perennial name for =
boondoggles, we'd like to move as far away from being a bridge to =
nowhere as we can but rather see how close we can come to being a big =
bridge that can act as a focal point for the cyberbridges that lead =
everywhere.

ROCKPILE is a collaboration between David Meltzer - poet, musician, =
essayist,=20

and more - and Michael Rothenberg, poet, songwriter and editor of Big =
Bridge Press. In the tradition of the troubadour and with the spirit of =
collaboration, David and Michael will journey through eight U.S. cities =
and perform poetry, composed on the road, with local musicians and =
artists in each city.

ROCKPILE will serve to educate, and preserve and create a history of =
collaboration and help to introduce as well as reinforce the tradition =
of the troubadour for all generations.=20

The project will end with a final multimedia performance in San =
Francisco.=20

Press. In the tradition of the troubadour and with the spirit of
collaboration, David and Michael will journey through eight U.S. cities and
perform poetry, composed on the road, with local musicians and artists in
each city.

*ROCKPILE* will serve to educate, and preserve and create a history of
collaboration and help to introduce as well as reinforce the tradition of
the troubadour for all generations.

The project will end with a final multimedia performance in San Francisco.

Check out the *ROCKPILE* Website and Blog at
http://bigbridge.org/rockpile/for complete gig dates, musician bios,

interactive exchange!

Hi all,

In five weeks, we'll be putting on our third annual Welcome to Boog
City festival, featuring more than 90 poets, musicians, and
playwrights performing at three venues, in two boroughs, over five
days, from Wed. Sept. 9- Sun. Sept. 13. Here's the online pdf of the
schedule:

http://www.welcometoboogcity.com/wbc3sked.pdf

A week before the event, we'll be putting out the festival issue of
Boog City. This issue will feature write-ups on some of the performers
and a full schedule, illustrated with images of each of the performers.

Advertising in the festival issue of Boog City means Poetic you will
reach more than 3,000 readers, poetry lovers, and small press
aficionados throughout the East Village, other targeted areas of lower
Manhattan; Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn; as well as bonus
distribution at Boog City's monthly events. That's an increase of
33.3% over our regular issues for no additional cost. And, since this
issue is also a program for the festival, readers will give it a
closer read as they check to see who's up later on that day and later
on in the festival.

Boog City continues to offer our special Small Press Ad Rates. That
means when you advertise with us you will save 50% off of our regular
display ad rates, making the adjusted Small Press Ad Rates:

      * Full Page        $220

Subject:      Linda Thompson Appeal
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="windows-1252"

I have just heard that Linda Thompson, singer-songwriter and former singi=
ng=20
partner to Richard Thompson, is having some difficulty funding her next a=
lbum=20
due to various changes in the music industry, which some of us regret. Sh=
e=20
has set up an appeal for funding at a site called The Hector Fund (a site=
 which=20
is something of an innovation in these matters). Her page on the site can=
 be=20
found here:

http://www.thehectorfund.com/about/linda-thompson/

Linda says:

=93I=92d like your help. I=92m trying to raise money so I can record the =
music, and be=20
able to pay the excellent musicians, engineers and studios a fair wage an=
d=20
release the album to the public. So I am asking for financing - not chari=
ty=20
(please save that for a more worthy cause) - but a business transaction. =
You,=20
the audience, put up some money and I return the favor by sending you the=
=20
music and much, much more!

I=92m trying to raise $50,000 to cover ALL of the costs associated with=20=

independently producing, manufacturing and marketing an album in today=92=
s=20
marketplace.

When I started playing music in the sixties and seventies, we shared=20
everything=96 perhaps some things we shouldn=92t have. I=92d like to retu=
rn to a little=20
bit of that spirit now. You the audience can share in the experience of m=
aking=20
my record with me and be the first to hear it when its done - and I get t=
o=20
stick it to =93the man=94 (whoever passes for the =91man=92 these days) b=
y working=20
outside of the system.=94

Having been a fan of Linda and Richard for many years, I think it is a di=
sgrace=20
that someone who has contributed so much musically over the years has to =
be=20
put in a position whereby she has to resort to financial help from fans a=
nd=20
public alike. It just goes to show the appalling state of the music busin=
ess,=20
which even in the folk/country genre is only thinking of the bottom dolla=
r.=20

So I hope some of you will help Linda, and, as she says, don=92t think of=
 it as=20
charity but more as sponsorship.=20

Hi, everyone,

I've begun a new recordings project. Each day I scout for unique sound envi=
ronments and sample from one to 10 minutes of "quotation." I began this pro=
ject on Monday. I posted my 4th recording just a few minutes ago. There is =
no commentary or context, just headings, which you must click on to listen.=
 A little box.net window will open up, so please have your pop-up blockers =
disabled.

Please visit

sitecitations.blogspot.com

and become a follower. And please leave comments. And check daily in the la=
te evening for new updates.

Thanks,

Christophe Casamassima

If you HAD TO spend a full day watching a webcam on your computer,
what would it be?  Maybe you don't want to, but suppose you HAD TO,
you're life depended on it.

Just for one day though.

My favorite, absolute favorite, without a doubt my favorite so far in
this lifetime is the one at Elvis' home in Memphis (it's so nice
seeing His grass and birds):
http://elvis-aron-presley.nl/graceland_incl_webcam.html

An Elvis fan I met at Graceland some years ago recently told me that
the Graceland webcam is out of date, and that there are webcams which
update more than every 60 seconds.  Is that true?  Well, I don't know
for sure, but this one's pretty great anyway.  I don't care that
everything I'm seeing actually happened 60 seconds ago.  Maybe
EVERYTHING we do happens on a 60 second delay anyway and we have no
idea!  It could be true!  The last time I was at Graceland I did a
special dance with a crazy Beale Street drag queen at the gates to
Graceland for all the viewers at home.  When I win the lottery my one
BIG luxury is going to be a big screen showing THIS webcam 24 hours a
day, which will be nice while eating morning oatmeal.

But what's your favorite webcam?  Am I the only one with a favorite
webcam?  There's another one I like that an old friend sent me of corn
growing in Iowa.  That was rather nice seeing Monsanto's finest!

the red dwgs retail for $1500 (very few exchanges), are

(great resource for locating local independent bookstores)

Why shop Indie?

http://www.indiebound.org/

When you shop at an independently owned business, your entire
community benefits:

The Economy

    * Spend $100 at a local and $68 of that stays in your community.
Spend the same $100 at a national chain, and your community only sees
$43.
    * Local businesses create higher-paying jobs for our neighbors.
    * More of your taxes are reinvested in your community--where they belon=
g.

The Environment

    * Buying local means less packaging, less transportation, and a
smaller carbon footprint.
    * Shopping in a local business district means less infrastructure,
less maintenance, and more money to beautify your community.

The Community

    * Local retailers are your friends and neighbors=97support them and
they=92ll support you.
    * Local businesses donate to charities at more than twice the rate
of national chains.
    * More independents means more choice, more diversity, and a truly
unique community.

Hello all,
I'm looking for critical works on homophonic translation--also, trying to
build a list of homophonic translations.

Many thanks for any information you can offer!

this is not "exactly" homophonic translation (of which i'm guilty of myself)
but perhaps more "radical" in the works and conceptions--or at least a lot
of  fun--("It's fun to have fun if you only know how," as the Cat in the
Head says--)

(both the below examples i cite have a wealth of critical materials involved
with them
the best way is to use the various--more than one--search engines at your
disposal--)--

So- one finds then- "translation"  at the core of a lot of the humor writing
in 19th Century America, especially since the "American language of the
time, despite the  first Webster's Dictionaries, " had not yet settled down
and become "fixed"  in its spellings, grammar, usages, meanings,(it still
hasn't to some degree--) --in other words, it hadn't yet "grown up " and
started making rules which grammarians and others liked to break, and so
essay "writing badly"--instead of merely mediocerly--

The American tongue  of the time was still in wildly wandering flux and
wildernesses of its own, so that often commentaries and maps and ideas or
phrases get translated into something completely "wrong" but to the persons
participating seems "perfectly clear,"  seems "all correct."---and is so
well liked it is taken in and "made to home" and handed a big cool jug of
dandelion wine--and "starts to take root in the hearts of the people" and
next thing you know has become a truly recognizably American word--

"all correct"  for example was turned into "ok" by President Jackson;  It is
said that in signing documents that met with his approval,  the hard
fightin, hard drinkin. rough edged Democratic general  of a President  would
sign in large letters --underlined with a flourish  to be sure!--the
letters/word "*OK*"--which to his mind was the abbreviation of "*all
correct"*-which he knew as -*"Ol Kur-ect"*

Artemus Ward was the past master of this form of translation humor--the
translation usually involving the vast differences, , as with President
Jackson, between the spoken and the written word in terms of shape
pronunciation meaning and sounds-

In one of Ward's stories for ex, two boys are discussing with a third
something really amazing that they have read about,in a big grimy book with
a title like "This Savage Whirled" --the discovery being no less than an
immense snake of the amazon itself a river twisting like a snake and so
immense- and exotic--and this exotic snake -a creature of the jungles more
vast than any  in America as far as they know-- is called by the local
inhabitants or at least the supposedly lost scientist adventurer--is called
by the mysterious name of  a "*Boy Constructor"*

The third member of the party is puzzling over how snake could be at the
same time a boy who is constructing something--a raft no doubt-- to escape
from the snake
but----confused he asks to see the actual book with the magical name for the
exotic immense snake--
and he reads out loud the words:  "*boa constricto*r"
of course the adherents of the boy constructor translation are laughing at
the down right ridiculousness of such a name for such a grand snake as "boa
constrictor"--

while the third boy is hopping mad and in rare Rumpelstiltskin form--pogoing
like a deranged punk rocker on the Savage Whirled book and tearing it and
pounding it to pieces--

another form of translation is also based on things popular in the 19th
century in America, being the democratization of what had been primarily a
language game of the elites in Russia and France--

this is the rebus madness that swept the country and was later seized upon
by a French Lettriste painter/poet  named Gabriel ("l"Ange Gabriel")
Pomerand as the method for making  of his underground ultra classic and
until recently very hard to find book  called in English "Saint Ghetto of
the Loans."

On the left  hand side of the book is are the pages with the poet's Prose
Poetry about the beloved area of Saint-Germain des Pres where he often
performed Sound and Lettriste Poetry  in the chichest of chic cafes for the
likes of de Beauvoir and Sartre, Boris Vian, Cocteau and al the rest of  St
Germain'
s In Crowd--

On the facing, right hand side of the book are the extremely complex and
beautiful rebuses  for each at times letter, syllable, word or tiny
contraction of two words-that appear in the Prose Poem   .--

The rebus then functions directly as for the most part homophonic
translations of the lexical prose poetry into the visual--
(in some ways this process reminds me a bit of playing charades--"Sounds
Like" (tugging the ear and then making faces and gestures people think mean
something like-- . "i'm deaf and i can't speak either" or there is a white
elephant in the room"---etc etc

I know these are not directly the recognized standard "homophonic
translations" which are very common and usually very easy ones to do --

you can even find them in those games and puzzles books for kids and if you
are really lucky maybe someday inside a Crackerjack box!

i know homophonic translations are often used as a writing exercise in
various writing workshops etc--or so i am told and have seen online these
things listed--

so i wd think just  search of the words "homphonic translations would lead
to some excellent and surprising sources!

meanwhile i shall return to my Artemus ward fragments and making rebuses for
the spirit that tires of words and craves images--

all very best for your search
but a goggle one shd unearth tons of things--

Hello all,
I'm looking for critical works on homophonic translation--also, trying to
build a list of homophonic translations.

Many thanks for any information you can offer!

Hi, Jonathan.

Thanks for the tip on the bookstore in Paris.  Unfortunately, I didn't
get there -- we were out in the sticks for a wedding in my wife's family
(in the northeast).  I'll keep it in mind for next year's trip, though.

I have another question for you.  I am participating in our
Environmental Studies program's Intro to ES course this year, a course
that is required of all students new to the program.  It is co-taught by
faculty from the program, with the goal of introducing students to
various approaches to ES from the different disciplines.  So, faculty
from History, Psychology, Environmental Science, Political Science, and
so on, each teach a two week block.  I will be doing the "humanities"
section, and I basically expect to ground the discussion in the ideas
and practices of ecopoetics.  You, of course, are far more expert in
that than I am, and I was wondering if you had any thoughts/suggestions
about how to approach such an opportunity.  The students are mostly
first or second years who likely have little experience with poetry/lit
(the program tends to draw scientists and poli-sci types); I get them
for four course meetings of 80minutes/each.

Any ideas you might have would be MUCH appreciated.

All best,

Robert

Petrichord Books is very pleased to announce the release of Guillermo
Parra's second chapbook, PHANTASMAL REPEATS. Spare, abstract,
thoughtful, the poems in PHANTASMAL REPEATS move sneakily within an
insular, ambient framework. They are self-referential to an extent but
still viscerally linked to the world at large.



PHANTASMAL REPEATS is available in two eye-catching color schemes: red
on curry or red on pool. If you have a preference, please specify when
ordering. The price is $6 (incl. s/h). Purchase via paypal at

or send a check made payable to Aaron Tieger to the address on the webpage.



Thank you!



SAMPLE POEM:



I sit alone in the house all day

Recurring rhythms make paste

My ears hummingbird control

An autobiography of loss

Forced into spy situations

On occasion, the rain clouds gather

Graphic proof serial songs

I write fitting spaces

For the sake of secrecy's map

Mon Music of Burma and Sondheim cds -


Fire Museum is a small label and needs your support! I've listed my favorite cd
of theirs - Mon Music of Burma - which is wonderfully complex - the kyam solo
on track six is incredible. I've also listed my own releases, all of which I
like, and all of which have been reviewed here and there online. Please
consider ordering any of these, and supporting Fire Museum and its releases,
many of which I find amazing. The Fire Museum site, with other listings, is at
http://www.museumfire.com/ . And please pass this on to anyone you think might
be interested.

Thanks, Alan, info -


Music from Fire Museum Records

Nai Htaw Paing Ensemble - Mon Music of Burma (FM 02):

The rarely recorded traditional music of the Mon people is vanishing
and endangered, highly developed, and barely known even to Asian
traditional music connoisseurs. Historically the Mon were a dominant,
highly cultured, and influential people in Burma more than a thousand
years ago.

There are several instruments peculiar to the Mon. Most recognizable is
the Kyam (crocodile zither), a 3-string long zither with frets that is
shaped like a crocodile. Another is the Batt Kine, a row of 14 or so
pitched gongs that is upturned at both ends like a crescent. Also,
there is the Mon violin, a 3-string fiddle with a western-like body
played upright. This is incredible music with an unique character!

Recorded in Yangon, Burma by noted musicologist Rick Heizman, the Nai Htaw
Paing Ensemble are recognized as masters of traditional Mon music. There
is currently an effort by concerned Mon people to revive and preserve Mon
culture, language, and identity, and this recording will help further this
effort.

INSTRUMENTATION:

Kyam - The kyam is perhaps the most distinctive Mon instrument. It is
often referred as the crocodile zither, and in Burmese language it is
called migyaung, mi kyaung or mijaun. A 3-string, long, fretted
zither, the body is carved into a crocodile shape.

Bat Kine - Another uniquely Mon instrument is the row of gongs known
as the Bat Kine. Rather than the circular set of tuned gongs used in
Burmese, Thai, Cambodian, and Laotian music, the Bat Kine is shaped
like a quarter full moon, upturned steeply on both ends.

Pone Pon - Underpinning most Mon (and Burmese) music is a small set of
drums played by one player. This set is known as the Hta Bone Pone Pon.
It has 4 small drums, a medium drum, and a large drum.

Graw - This 'Upright Viola' is an old and rare Mon traditional
instrument. It has a western-looking body, but is strung with only
3 strings. Before the British colonizers came there were some
traditional 2 or 3 string fiddle instruments, afterwards musicians
copied the body stylings of the western violin.

Battala - 23-key bamboo xylophone. The keys are soaked for up to
three years to elicit the best timbre.

Kha dae-Kha bart - In almost all Mon and Burmese music one hears the
small cymbals and the wood clacker that serve a time-keeping function.

Khanwe - a double reed oboe-like instrument.

Talutt - A bamboo flute of various sizes and types of bamboo.

BIO OF NAI HTAW PAING:

The leader of this ensemble, he currently serves as an assistant lecturer
at Yangon Cultural University. He Started studying Mon traditional musical
instruments, singing, and dance from his father, Nai Khin Maung Gyi, in
1965. Regularly performs on Mon National Days, Mon State Day, Union Day,
and other important receptions. He occasionally teaches the new generation
of musicians but has difficulty finding time given the economic situation
of the profession. He would like more Mon nationals to be aware of both
their own music, Myanmar traditional music and other world musics. He is
passionate about rediscovering and preserving the endangered arts of the
Mon culture.

Alan Sondheim/Ritual Al 770 - The Songs (FM 04):

First ever reissue of "The Songs", the debut recording by Alan Sondheim &
Ritual All 770, originally released on Riverboat Records (later recordings
appeared on ESP Disk). Recorded in March 1967 and included on the
legendary Nurse With Wound list of experimental recordings, on this album
Alan Sondheim played Electric Guitar, Violin, Flute, Suling, Xylophone,
Alto Saxophone, Classical Guitar, Clarinet, Shenai, Bass Recorder,
Mandolin, So-na, Hawaiian Guitar, Koto, Sopranino Recorder, Chimta, Cor
Anglais, Sitar and Bansari.

Joined by Barry Sugarman (Tabla, Dholak & Naquerra), Chris Mattheson
(Bass), Robert Poholek (Trumpet & Cornet), Ruth Ann Hutchinson (Vocals),
June Fellows (Vocals) and J.Z. (Jazz Drums); Ritual All 770 were a group
of improvisors living in Providence, Rhode Island. (Perhaps they could be
considered the sonic forebearers of the Fort Thunder scene...) Rejecting
the notion that avant garde music was solely the realm of isolated
academia, they delved fearlessly and joyously into their music, creating a
work that sounds fresh nearly 40 years later.

FROM THE LINER NOTES:

This work is a single improvised performance in which one of the
performers sings "Oratorio on the end of illusions", although, in my
libretto the words were originally "Oratorio on the end of visions". A
libretto of eight pages was prepared. The vocalists were not told how to
sing it. They could go backward or repeat any section if they wanted to.
There was no score. The only instruction given to the instrumentalists was
this: no playing behind the koto or classical guitar. I had several
rehearsals with each of them, mostly individually. The session lasted
through two takes, this is the second. After the master was made, I added
reverberation and volume controlling; other than that, all of the music
heard here is from the live performance.

Dan Wharburton of Paris Transatlantic said of the reissue of The Songs:

"an endearingly ramshackle melting pot of free jazz, blues and folk (if
Eugene Chadbourne later described his work as "free improvised country &
western bebop" then this is "free improvised Hawaiian flamenco gospel
blues music theatre).. its influence resonates (indirectly, one imagines,
unless there are more copies of the original vinyl in circulation than I
imagine) in the free folk of today's New Weird America scene."

Now listeners have the opportunity to hear for themselves the present day
song form manifestations of this overlooked creative master.

Alan Sondheim - Ski/nn (FM 07):

The return of Alan Sondheim!

A recording of solo acoustic guitar and alpine zither songs, this release
will delight those familiar with his early Riverboat (reissued as FM 04)
and ESP Disc recordings as well as the audience for experimental solo
guitar - while creating an audience for experimental solo alpine zither!
On this release, Alan performs on the 1927 martin tenor guitar, 19th
century parlor guitar, 1920s prime alpine zither and 1860s elegie alpine
zither.

Alan Sondheim - Boojum (mm 9):

Boojum was our cat, who died recently at 18, and is missed terribly. Most
tracks are recorded mono directly from a Yamaha keyboard output. This is
the 'pure' sounding of the machine; there's no stereo enhancement or
graphic equalization. I determine the state of the machine, that's called
playing it. The accompaniment is automated but its figuration is not. The
keyboard is touch-sensitive, but as you know, touch on an acoustic
keyboard translates not only into volume, but also harmonic structures and
envelope. Here touch is volume only. Note that all playing is live.

The Cluster track is recorded from a very large Beowulf computer cluster
which generates considerable electromagnetic radiation in the radio
spectrum. These are recorded acoustically from a Realistic Patrolman SW-60
radio slowly tuned across various SW, VHF, and UHF bands. This is the
sound of the machine in air, transformed into audio signals within the
range of human hearing. Machine-states and machine exist in the imaginary.
Emanents exist within and without the machine..

Think of the true world in all its glory.

There's an essay by Harry Mathews that might provide a useful starting point
in situating homphonic translation within a larger context of translation
practices:

Mathews, Harry. "Translation and the Oulipo: The Case of the Persevering
Maltese." In his _The Case of the Perservering Maltese: Collected Essays_.
Dalkey Archive Press, 2003. There's an electronic version at
http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/electropoetics/ethno-linguist --
don't know if it differs from the printed version.

As far as works, there is, of course, David Melnick's "Men in Aida"
conveniently archived on Eclipse
(http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/AIDA/aida.html).

On a smaller scale, there is my homophonic translation of Martin Luther's
explanation of the Ten Commandments from the Small Catechism in my book, _A
Map by a Dim Lamp_
(http://www.amazon.com/Map-Dim-Lamp-Ron-Starr/dp/0977616266/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UT
F8&s=books&qid=1249971843&sr=1-4).

Does anyone know why Zukofsky didn't index every instance of "a" or "the" or any number of other words? "a" appears on page 21 and is not listed in the index.

WASHINGTON =E2=80=94 R. Dwayne Betts is having coffee at Busboys and Poets,=
 a coffeehouse/bookstore/neighborhood hangout here in the trendy U Street a=

on of Freedom: A Memoir of Learning, Survival and Coming of Age in Prison(A=

At 16, Betts was sent to prison for nine years. Now 28, he is living such a=
 radically different life even he is astonished by how far he has traveled.
"I still remember my mom crying in the courtroom when I was sentenced," he =
says. "I didn't want that image to be the only thing I remembered the rest =
of my life."

Over the Top and Beneath Contempt

By: Roger Simon

Politico.com - August 11, 2009 04:44 AM EST

http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/25991.html

Today, we live in the age of rabid response.

Not rapid response. Rapid response was yesterday. Rapid
response was the political tactic of responding quickly
to all attacks, no matter how outrageous or
unbelievable.

Those who did not respond rapidly, those who told
themselves the public would not believe outright lies,
failed to win higher office. (Thus Democrats still blame
John Kerry for not responding rapidly enough in 2004 to
the attacks of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.)

Rabid response is different.

The purpose of rabid response is to scorch the earth, to
raise the stakes, to go nuclear in the hope that your
opponent will be so shellshocked he can make no response
at all. The purpose of rabid response is to grab the
public by the throat and not let go.

Have concerns over Barack Obama's health care plan? I
don't doubt it. The plan is very long and very
complicated and still a work in progress.

But there is one thing we do know about it: It will
establish "death panels."

These death panels will determine whether you, your
baby, your parents or your grandparents will receive
health care or be left to die. In the street. Like a
dog.

How will the death panels operate? Who will be on them?
Will they validate parking? We do not know. We know only
that the death panels will judge each individual's
"level of productivity in society" and render a life or
death judgment.

So says Sarah Palin on her Facebook page.

In olden times, Palin might have made this claim at a
speech or during a news conference where reporters might
have asked questions like: "What proof do you have?" or
"Aren't you just trying to scare people?"

But Palin does not risk that. She takes no questions.
She has done her duty as a rabid responder. She has rung
the tocsin, sounded the alarm, lit the signal fire.

Truth? Accuracy? Responsibility?

Not her territory.

Glenn Beck is a rabid responder on race. "This
president, I think, he has exposed himself as a guy over
and over and over again who has a deep-seated hatred for
white people or the white culture," Beck says. "This guy
is, I believe, a racist."

Rush Limbaugh is a rabid responder on Nazis and
swastikas. He knows a lot about swastikas. He sees them
everywhere. He looks at the Obama health care logo -
which incorporates the familiar medical symbol of twin
serpents on a staff - and sees it as being "damn close
to a Nazi swastika logo." Speaker of the House Nancy
Pelosi muddied the waters - surprise! - by saying those
who oppose Obama's health care plan "are carrying
swastikas and symbols like that to a town meeting on
health care."

But Limbaugh had a rabid response for that: "There are
far more similarities between Nancy Pelosi and Adolf
Hitler than between these people showing up at town
halls to protest a Hitler-like policy that's being
heralded by a Hitler-like logo."

And then, out of left (or right) field, came this: "Ted
Kennedy's dad, by the way, Joe Kennedy, sympathetic to
Hitler, sympathetic to the Nazis," Limbaugh said.

But Limbaugh was not done with the Nazis or Hitler. In
the world of rabid response, invoking the ultimate
symbols of evil to describe one's political opponents is
routine.

It doesn't matter what you say, as long as it is over
the top and beneath contempt.

"Adolf Hitler, like Barack Obama, also ruled by
dictate," Limbaugh said. "Hitler said he didn't need to
meet with his Cabinet; he represented the will of the
people. He was called the messiah. He said the people
spoke through him."

Which means, I guess, if Hitler were alive today, he
would be a talk show host.

Dear Poets,

We have just constructed our first exhibition of mp3 poetry.

Really, check it out.

We'd be downright depressed if you didn't.

Plus, it's free.

When viewing Exhibition 1, please remember that the table of contents leads
you to separate sections of the edition (there are 6 sections altogether).
If you want to see artists that are not in 1-1, but in 1-3  or 1-4, etc.,
you need to click the artist name (in 1-1) to be transported to the section
in which the artist is located. We're also including links to each
individual section (for additional convenience).

Here is a link to Exhibition 1-1 (where the first section as well as the
table of contents can be found):

http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/bc2498b9#/bc2498b9/1


Here are links to the additional 5 sections

Subject:      walking to Whitman's house with Joey
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I dream'd in a dream, I saw a city invincible to the attacks of the
whole of the rest of the earth;
I dream'd that was the new City of Friends;
Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love--it led the rest;
It was seen every hour in the actions of men of that city,
And in all their looks and words.

(from Leaves of Grass)


Our good friend Joseph Yearous-Algozin is moving to Buffalo on Monday
morning, but today we took a pilgrimage we've been threatening to make
for a long time. Walking across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge to Camden
in the intense heat was exhausting, so we stopped off at the Walt
Whitman Center to hang out on a couch in the air conditioned theater,
and to fill our water bottles with the disgusting tap water in the
bathroom. NOT that I've ever eaten a urinal cake mind you, but I do
believe this water is what it would taste like.

The folks working at the center for some reason had no idea that
Mickle Boulevard, where Whitman's house sits, no longer exists as
Mickle Boulevard. I've walked to this house before over the years and
know that it's right across the street from the prison, which is why I
was confused standing on Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard CERTAIN that
we were in the right place. Joey asked a couple pushing a stroller who
told us the boulevard was renamed after King. Maybe the WALT WHITMAN
CENTER needs to know this?

The walk through the streets of Camden was a sad walk, sadder than I
ever remember it being.  When we arrived at the house it was closed,
but we looked through the mail slot to peer at a portrait of the gray
poet on a wall.

We decided to sit on the front steps in the shade of a tree, where we
were soon joined by men begging for change from anyone who walked
past. 20 cents asked for, then 30 cents. "I dream'd in a dream..."
There were a dozen plastic beer can rings strewn over the sidewalk in
front of the house, and a parade of men with the unmistakable,
unsettling glaze of crack-cocaine in their eyes. It's not just in the
eyes of course, but in the unsteady gait and a musculature not
entirely owned by the men, somewhere, inside the bodies. Few things
frighten me more than that jagged, zombie strut.

This was the saddest visit I've ever made to Walt Whitman's house. In
the past I've witnessed women and children standing in front of his
house to motion their homemade sign language to loved ones at the
windows of the prison across the street. It was too hot today for sign
language, but we saw women and children leaving the prison after their
visits. One boy, no more than six, wiping tears from his face with the
backs of his fists, trying to push the tears back inside his head or
keep them from coming out, or both, and a young woman -- possibly his
sister -- texting on her cell phone several paces ahead of him,
seemingly unaware of, or uninterested in his overwhelmed state. That
little boy was the saddest sight of all, incredibly depressing, and
the kind of sight you see and wonder WHAT CAN BE DONE to help people
have their needs met?

When I say this was the saddest visit I've ever made, it felt more
like visiting Dante than the body electric celebrations of gentle
Walt.

Walt Whitman's dream of a city invincible was either a terribly wrong
prediction, or a dream he hoped for his fellow citizens which the
future had no intention of honoring. A day among broken, breaking
souls for Joey and I, but of course Camden is Camden everyday, and we
were just visitors. The boulevard is renamed after Dr. Martin Luther
King, the new address for Walt Whitman's house, but changing the name
of the street is hardly the answer to anyone's misery.

And I'm not saying I have answers, but I am wondering WHY the city's
leadership is spending time and energy and money changing maps, and
buying all these shiny new boulevard signs when the bail bonds shops
are blossoming in the neighborhood, and building after building is
boarded up? And drug addicts continue to be somebody's child, brother,
father, uncle, lost in such a way it's hard to imagine how to ever
bring them back. Camden, were you even the city Whitman dream'd in his
dream? Was he dreaming of another city? But the poem is quoted in
granite on the tower of Camden's city hall, and again in the train
station.

The city CLAIMS the poem without apology, towering above all heads are
these words, and you don't need to squint to read the massive carved
letters. You can see it everyday I DREAMED A CITY INVINCIBLE. It's a
pox upon all who attempt to thrive here, endless days of misery, which
from my gauge is getting ever more miserable with each visit I make.
I'm feeling despair for our world tonight, and cannot listen to the
news with all the ASSHOLE Republicans talking about Americans NOT
NEEDING proper health care, not needing care, not what? Not what? Not
needing? The need is immense, it's almost too painful to examine just
how many needs are not being met while these SCUM bargain down the
price while bargaining down the 20/20 vision of the world around us,
here, everyday in Camden, and elsewhere.

I'm sleeping with nightmares of Whitman's house tonight, and all his
neighbors awaiting "the quality of robust love."

'videogames as literary devices' appears in 'videogames and art' (

mitchell (intellect books, u of chicago press, 2007). the essay looks at
degrees of subordination of game to art in four online art games: Natalie
Bookchin's 'The Intruder'; Regina Célia Pinto's 'Viewing Axolotls'; Neil
Hennessey's 'Pac Mondrian'; and my 'Arteroids'.

another essay of mine, 'language explosion: poetry and entertainment in

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

for anyone struggling with vegan/vegetarian issues, please rent "Earthlings," perhaps the most powerful expose on animal welfare issues ever ... whenever ... the revolting images are too powerful to ignore, & ignoring the consequences of our actions, as the late David Foster Wallace points out, are an easy, cheap, lazy, and cowerdly ploy (see essay, Consider the Lobster, book, same title.). Concerning language and nonhuman mamals, Wallace writes:

The fact that even the most highly evolved nonhuman mamals can't use language to communicate with us about their subjective mental experience is only the first layer of additional complication in trying to extend our reasoning about pain and morality to animals. And everything gets progressively more abstract and convolved as we move farther and farther out from the highertype mammaals into cattle and swine and dogs and cats and rodents, and then birds and fish, and finally invertebrates like lobsters.

Two new books by the Irish poet Gabriel Rosenstock, published by CSP
(Cambridge Scholars Publishing) will be launched in D=FAn Laoghaire,
County Dublin, Ireland on 29 August 2009 in the Kingston Suite of the

Rosenstock's books are titled "Haiku Enlightenment" & "Haiku, the
Gentle Art of Disappearing."  They are the poets contemplations &
musings about haiku & the form(s) of haiku.  Early versions of these
texts were serialised in the electronic journal World Haiku Review.

Gabriel Rosenstock believes that "there is something going on in the
literary & artistic energies at the eastern & western extremes of
Europe which have shamanistic/druidic forces as part of their DNA, so
to speak, energies that produce a vital poetry that is not a
commentary on life, as such, but life itself, the living, breathing
spirit ... one of the reasons I love haiku is because it offers an
entrance into the pervading spirit of a place, a temenos ..."

With this e-announcement, there is a way of getting a 50% reduction
for advance orders of these new books by Rosenstock!  Though this 50%

**Charles Bernstein
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/
The Lenny Paschen monologue, from The Lenny Paschen Show
The three librettos I wrote for Ben Yarmolinsky in the early 1990s =20
used vernacular American forms to create contemporary operas with a =20
social and historical address. Blind Witness News (1990) and The Lenny =20=

Paschen Show (1992) used the typical format of late-night TV, while =20
The Subject (1991) starts with a psychoanalytic session.

Lenny is the final work of the trilogy. Much of the opening monologue, =20=

to be presented at this event, was cut, for reasons of length, from =20
the final libretto.

In its typical process of canceling sense, television is, of course, =20
the offense to meaning that is addressed in The Lenny Paschen Show. =20
Lenny Paschen is a gladiator in an electronic age=97a hot fighter in a =20=

cool medium (and he may also cut against the grain of the lyric =20
impulse within opera). Lenny is trapped from the start, yet his =20
struggle for moral discourse makes this opera a fin de millennia =20
version of Die Meistersinger=97sans masters, sans paradise, all songs. =20=

Lenny seems to preach that we can get beyond the puppetry of TV =20
personas, but, as he also insists, he remains a puppet of his own =20
devices. The Lenny Paschen Show uses the tools at hand, especially the =20=

tradition of black, often abrasive, comedy to explore the worlds =20
flaunted by, and also hidden within, one of the central formats of =20
commercial TV.

Charles Bernstein=92s books include Blind Witness: Three American Operas =

(Factory School), new in 2008; Girly Man (University of Chicago =20

A woman finds herself having retreated into her =93inner cave=94 with =
her =20
invisible =93power animal=94 ROAR-SHOCK by her side. It is a little bit =
of =20
Paradise where she tries to relax, forget her problems, and just =20
chill. But as an actor, she treats her =93inner cave=94 as a proscenium =20=

stage with an attendant audience, for whom she performs herself, =20
trying to win their acceptance and recognition. Yet once performing, =20
she must account for herself. Even though she has no back-story or =20
=93character=94 as such, she keeps peeling away layers of her presence =
in =20
an attempt to be remembered before the lights go down.

Dear SUNY-Buffaloers,

I am working on a project which is in need of some solid scholarship on this point, among others:

Skillful use of
language is critical to a society's health.

Feel free to backchannel me at pen (at) splab (dot) org or let the opinions rip on the list. Looking for something accessible and experiential more than theoretical.

Grazie,

Dear Poeticists,

If you would like to write a review of Barbara Henning's new novel
'Thirty Miles To Rosebud' (published by BlazeVOX) please contact me at
Jacket magazine
p.brown62@gmail.com

Thirty Miles To Rosebud depicts a series of imploding families and
fast interstates. Barbara Henning's landscapes-- a rust-belt
childhood, a nearly forgotten East Village Bohemia and the arid
Southwest streaked with the setting sun=97are populated by runaways,
lost loves and lifelong betrayals. In this remarkable novel, Henning's
eye for detail and her emotional honesty enables the past to loom in
the rear-view mirror long after the car has sped by.

Thanks,
Pam Brown

My publish-on-demand works


My publish-on-demand books from Blue Lion, Fort/Da, Blazevox, and Alt-X -
Please consider ordering. The Blue Lion is just now coming out (over 500
pages), and The Accidental Artist appeared a few months ago. These books
are the soul of my work (such as it is); I'm close to them and I've been
lucky that the publishers gave me free reign over content.


Azure, Nature, Digital: Blue Lion

Description - two sections: The first, with Sandy Baldwin, is on the
phenomenology of the analog/digital, and the second is culled from the
entire Internet Text, presenting literary/codework texts with peripheral
philosophical content. I'm really happy that Blue Lion gave me the
opportunity to do this, since it shows how my work hangs together and
actually 'goes somewhere,' says something. Thanks to Peter Ganick and
Jukka-Pekka Kervinen.

The Accidental Artist: Fort/Da

http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/the-accidental-artist/4965130
http://stores.lulu.com/publicdomaininc

This is a short and intense collection of writings around Second Life and
the phenomenology of the virtual - I really love these texts, thanks to
Robert Cheatham who went over them with me.


Vel: Blazevox

http://www.blazevox.org/bk-as.htm
http://www.blazevox.org/catalog.htm

These texts were produced in relation to West Virginia University's
Virtual Environments Laboratory, and deal with motion capture, virtual
modeling, and scanning. But the texts are codework themselves, and
virtuality is embedded within them. Thanks to Geoffrey Gatza for this
opportunity.

.echo: Alt-X

http://www.altx.com/ebooks/echo.html
(goes both to download and Print On Demand)

This was the first of the POD books, thanks to Ron Sukenick and Mark
Amerika. The texts include the entire Nikuko Parable series (Nikuko and
others appear throughout the other works as well) and other avatar-
oriented texts.

Please consider purchasing any of the above. Please note that all of these
publishers have amazing publications (including a great book by Sandy
Baldwin from Blazevox) and need your support in general. And thanks of
course.

(Finally, please note I have a paperback, The Wayward, available from
Salt, which is beautifully typeset and covers a great deal of ground.)

This is the end of the self-promotion material - apologies if I've
offended anyone.

- Alan

Edited by Tom Hazuka, Christine Perkins and Mark Budman

To be published by Persea Books in 2010. The target audience is students =
grades 8 to 12. Stories cover a broad range of topics of interest to =
contemporary teens such as growing up, budding sexuality, finding a =
place in society, etc. The main criteria for the stories are =
literary/artistic values, teen interests and a length of 1000 words or =
shorter. Various POVS are acceptable as long as the stories focus on =
teens.

We are looking for more diverse stories (African American, Asian =
American, Native American, LGBT, Jewish, Muslim, etc.), and more stories =
about, or at least featuring, current technology (cell phones, =
computers, etc.).
=20
Previously published stories are fine, but you must hold the rights.

Rosenmann-Taub has lived in the US for the past several decades - a life of=

If you shop at ubuweb you get a completely other side to the history
of music that is rarely covered by by more conventional approaches to
the canon.

The brutal truth about America's healthcare

An extraordinary report from Guy Adams in Los Angeles
at the music arena that has been turned into a
makeshift medical centre

Saturday, 15 August 2009 The Independent [UK]
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-brutal-truth-about-americarsquos-healthcare-1772580.html

They came in their thousands, queuing through the night
to secure one of the coveted wristbands offering entry
into a strange parallel universe where medical care is
a free and basic right and not an expensive luxury.
Some of these Americans had walked miles simply to have
their blood pressure checked, some had slept in their
cars in the hope of getting an eye-test or a mammogram,
others had brought their children for immunisations
that could end up saving their life.

In the week that Britain's National Health Service was
held aloft by Republicans as an "evil and Orwellian"
example of everything that is wrong with free
healthcare, these extraordinary scenes in Inglewood,
California yesterday provided a sobering reminder of
exactly why President Barack Obama is trying to reform
the US system.

The LA Forum, the arena that once hosted sell-out
Madonna concerts, has been transformed - for eight days
only - into a vast field hospital. In America, the
offer of free healthcare is so rare, that news of the
magical medical kingdom spread rapidly and long lines
of prospective patients snaked around the venue for the
chance of getting everyday treatments that many British
people take for granted.

In the first two days, more than 1,500 men, women and
children received free treatments worth $503,000
(#304,000). Thirty dentists pulled 471 teeth; 320
people were given standard issue spectacles; 80 had
mammograms; dozens more had acupuncture, or saw kidney
specialists. By the time the makeshift medical centre
leaves town on Tuesday, staff expect to have dispensed
$2m worth of treatments to 10,000 patients.

The gritty district of Inglewood lies just a few miles
from the palm-lined streets of Beverly Hills and the
bright lights of Hollywood, but is a world away. And
the residents who had flocked for the free medical
care, courtesy of mobile charity Remote Area Medical,
bore testament to the human cost of the healthcare mess
that President Obama is attempting to fix.

Christine Smith arrived at 3am in the hope of seeing a
dentist for the first time since she turned 18. That
was almost eight years ago. Her need is obvious and
pressing: 17 of her teeth are rotten; some have large
visible holes in them. She is living in constant pain
and has been unable to eat solid food for several
years.

"I had a gastric bypass in 2002, but it went wrong, and
stomach acid began rotting my teeth. I've had several
jobs since, but none with medical insurance, so I've
not been able to see a dentist to get it fixed," she
told The Independent. "I've not been able to chew food
for as long as I can remember. I've been living on
soup, and noodles, and blending meals in a food mixer.
I'm in constant pain. Normally, it would cost $5,000 to
fix it. So if I have to wait a week to get treated for
free, I'll do it. This will change my life."

Along the hall, Liz Cruise was one of scores of people
waiting for a free eye exam. She works for a major
supermarket chain but can't afford the $200 a month
that would be deducted from her salary for insurance.
"It's a simple choice: pay my rent, or pay my
healthcare. What am I supposed to do?" she asked. "I'm
one of the working poor: people who do work but can't
afford healthcare and are ineligible for any free
healthcare or assistance. I can't remember the last
time I saw a doctor."

Although the Americans spend more on medicine than any
nation on earth, there are an estimated 50 million with
no health insurance at all. Many of those who have jobs
can't afford coverage, and even those with standard
policies often find it doesn't cover commonplace
procedures. California's unemployed - who rely on
Medicaid - had their dental care axed last month.

Julie Shay was one of the many, waiting to slide into a
dentist's chair where teeth were being drilled in full
view of passers-by. For years, she has been crossing
over the Mexican border to get her teeth done on the
cheap in Tijuana. But recently, the US started
requiring citizens returning home from Mexico to
produce a passport (previously all you needed was a
driver's license), and so that route is now closed.
Today she has two abscesses and is in so much pain she
can barely sleep. "I don't have a passport, and I can't
afford one. So my husband and I slept in the car to
make sure we got seen by a dentist. It sounds pathetic,
but I really am that desperate."

"You'd think, with the money in this country, that we'd
be able to look after people's health properly," she
said. "But the truth is that the rich, and the
insurance firms, just don't realise what we are going
through, or simply don't care. Look around this room
and tell me that America's healthcare don't need
fixing."

President Obama's healthcare plans had been a central
plank of his first-term programme, but his reform
package has taken a battering at the hands of
Republican opponents in recent weeks. As the Democrats
have failed to coalesce around a single,
straightforward proposal, their rivals have seized on
public hesitancy over "socialised medicine" and now the
chance of far-reaching reform is in doubt.

Most damaging of all has been the tide of vociferous
right-wing opponents whipping up scepticism at town
hall meetings that were supposed to soothe doubts. In
Pennsylvania this week, Senator Arlen Specter was
greeted by a crowd of 1,000 at a venue designed to
accommodate only 250, and of the 30 selected speakers
at the event, almost all were hostile.

The packed bleachers in the LA Forum tell a different
story. The mobile clinic has been organised by the
remarkable Remote Area Medical. The charity usually
focuses on the rural poor, although they worked in New
Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Now they are moving
into more urban venues, this week's event in Los
Angeles is believed to be the largest free healthcare
operation in the country.

Doctors, dentists and therapists volunteer their time,
and resources to the organisation. To many US medical
professionals, it offers a rare opportunity to plug
into the public service ethos on which their trade was
supposedly founded. "People come here who haven't seen
a doctor for years. And we're able to say 'Hey, you
have this, you have this, you have this'," said Dr
Vincent Anthony, a kidney specialist volunteering five
days of his team's time. "It's hard work, but
incredibly rewarding. Healthcare needs reform,
obviously. There are so many people falling through the
cracks, who don't get care. That's why so many are
here."

Ironically, given this week's transatlantic spat over
the NHS, Remote Area Medical was founded by an
Englishman: Stan Brock. The 72-year-old former public
schoolboy, Taekwondo black belt, and one-time presenter
of Wild Kingdom, one of America's most popular animal
TV shows, left the celebrity gravy train in 1985 to, as
he puts it, "make people better".

Today, Brock has no money, no income, and no bank
account. He spends 365 days a year at the charity
events, sleeping on a small rolled-up mat on the floor
and living on a diet made up entirely of porridge and
fresh fruit. In some quarters, he has been described,
without too much exaggeration, as a living saint.

Though anxious not to interfere in the potent
healthcare debate, Mr Brock said yesterday that he, and
many other professionals, believes the NHS should
provide a benchmark for the future of US healthcare.

"Back in 1944, the UK government knew there was a
serious problem with lack of healthcare for 49.7
million British citizens, of which I was one, so they
said 'Hey Mr Nye Bevan, you're the Minister for
Health... go fix it'. And so came the NHS. Well, fast
forward now 66 years, and we've got about the same
number of people, about 49 million people, here in the
US, who don't have access to healthcare."

"I've been very conservative in my outlook for the
whole of my life. I've been described as being about
90,000 miles to the right of Attila the Hun. But I
think one reaches the reality that something doesn't
work... In this country something has to be done. And
as a proud member of the US community but a loyal
British subject to the core, I would say that if
Britain could fix it in 1944, surely we could fix it
here in America.

Here is a link to the allmusic entry on Dylan:
http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=3Damg&sql=3D11:0ifrxqe5ldhe

I'm not sure where you ended up on your search for Dylan. Personally, I
prefer to navigate the AllMusic site through Google, as I do with many othe=
r
sites. If I'm going to do a search for Bob Dylan, I don't go to allmusic an=
d
then search for "Bob Dylan." I do a Google search for "Bob Dylan allmusic."
And that will take me right to the profile.'

Make sure to take note of the tabs, especially discography. There are full
reviews of most albums and, for Dylan, most songs.

I do this particularly with AllMusic because I find that it has slow load
times.

Here is the text from the Dylan AllMusic Page just cut and pasted into this
email: Good bye!


Biographyby Stephen Thomas Erlewine

Bob Dylan's influence on popular music is incalculable. As a songwriter, he
pioneered several different schools of pop songwriting, from confessional
singer/songwriter to winding, hallucinatory, stream of conscious narratives=
.
As a vocalist, he broke down the notion that a singer must have a
conventionally good voice in order to perform, thereby redefining the
vocalist's role in popular music. As a musician, he sparked several genres
of pop music, including electrified folk-rock and country-rock. And that
just touches on the tip of his achievements. Dylan's force was evident
during his height of popularity in the '60s -- the
Beatles<http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=3Damg&sql=3D11:hifrxqw5ldse>'
shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-'60s never would have
happened without him -- but his influence echoed throughout several ... Rea=

press and usually have 3-6) for 60 minutes total. We also have a =20

able to book the musical act that=92s preferred, so it=92s truly their =20=

The Danny’s Reading Series (8th Anniversary Reading with Chicago Indie
Presses!)
Wednesday, August 26th
7:30 PM

The writers:  Adam Clay, Kathleen Rooney, Steve Halle, Mary Hamilton,
Kristen Orser, and Patrick Durgin with Hannah Weiner

The presses:  Cinematheque Press, Switchback Books, Cracked Slab Books,
Featherproof Books, Dancing Girl Press, and Kenning Editions

Eight years in. It’s hard to believe. While we spend a lot of our time
hosting poets and writers from elsewhere, as we venture into our ninth
season, we thought it appropriate to turn our eye on our hometown. We’d
like to celebrate the work of a selection (there are so many more!) of
Chicago indie presses and their authors. Diverse in publishing vision,
ideals, and execution—all committed to defining quality for themselves,
the imagination, to the vast work on the part of the author to bring it
to life, and to the vastly detailed work of bringing it to our hands and
eyes—we salute and celebrate the necessary parts all of them play in
bringing Chicago to life and the world to light. And, as always,
celebrating the audience that gives us life and is our light.

Joel Craig & Chris Glomski

Kristen Orser  is the author of Squint, published by Dancing Girl Press.
Kristen Orser is anxious.  She is probably behind on work and her

promote the work of women poets and artists through chapbooks, journals,
book arts projects, and anthologies. (dancinggirlpress.com

school poetics. Her books include The Fast, We Speak Silent, and PAGE.

The Dispersive Anatomies special issue of Leonardo is up!


http://www.leonardo.info/LEA/DispersiveAnatomies/DispersiveAnatomies.html

Do take a look at this - it has a stunning group of artists, theorists,
thinkers of all sorts - we're quite proud of it. Due to editorial changes
at MIT, it's been two years in the making, but it's a worthwhile wait!

Thanks for your patience, and please check it out!

Here's a description of the original call for the issue:

**
*Dispersive Anatomies*
**
*Guest Editors:* Sandy Baldwin, Alan Sondheim and Mez Breeze
**

*Call for papers - LEA Dispersive Anatomies*
*-------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Leonardo Electronic Almanac (ISSN No: 1071-4391) is inviting papers
and artworks that address dispersion - dispersion of bodies, objects,
landscapes, networks, virtual and real worlds.

A fundamental shift in the way we view the world is underway: the
abandonment of discrete objects, and objecthood itself. The world is now
plural, and the distinction between real and virtual is becoming
increasingly blurred, with troubling consequences within the geopolitical
register. This shift is related to a cultural change that emphasizes
digital deconstruction over analog construction: a photograph for example
can be accessed and transformed, pixel by pixel, cities can be taken apart
by gerrymandering or eminent domain, and our social networks are replete
with names and images that problematize friendship, sexuality, and culture
itself. One issue that emerges here: Are we networking or are we
networked? Are we networks ourselves?

LEA is interested in texts and works that deal with this fundamental shift
in new and illuminating ways. Specifically, anything from essays through
multimedia through networks themselves may be considered. We're
particularly interested in submissions that deal with the incoherency of
the world, and how to address it. *Key topics of interest
---------------------------------

*Topics of interest might include (but are not limited to):
- Networked warfare in real and virtual worlds.
- The wounded/altered body in real and virtual worlds.
- Transgressive sexualities across borders, sexualities among body-parts,
dismemberments and groups, both real and virtual.

- Critical texts on the transformation of classical narrative - from its
emphasis on an omniscient narrator and coherent plots/characters, to
literatures of incoherency, dispersed narrations, and the jump-cut
exigencies of everyday life.

- Deleuze/Guattari, TAZ, and other phenomena at the border of networking.
- Internet visions and their abandonment or fulfillment.
- The haunting of the world by ghosts, virtual beings, dreams and nightmares
that never resolve.

- The geopolitical collapse of geopolitics.
- Military empires as scattershot entrepreneurial corporations.

Dispersion has two vectors: the breakup or breakdown of coherent objects;
and the subsequent attempt to corral, curtail, or recuperate from this
breakdown. How do we deal with networks that are constantly coalescing and
disappearing? Where are we in the midst of this? In an era of pre-emptive
culture, is guerilla warfare to be accompanied by guerilla culture as the
order of the day?

Indeed.

Although I'm using Sondheim's name to push my propaganda.
Bear with me, please.

Previously, I had posted something about the animal rights dvd, earthlings.
I forgot to mention some of the distinguished names associated with it.

Notably, Issac B. Singer, Nobel L.
& Princton philosopher, Peter Singer.

To paraphrase Peter Singer, "If there's there's one film I could make everyone on the planet watch, it'd be this one."

 I also recommended the book and essay by David Foster Wallace entitled "Consider the Lobster."
I became somewhat overly animated, though.

I said, As Foster noted ... cowardly this ... amongst other thing... all of which I infered from reading Foster.
Foster's essay was far more nuanced.

 A Paradox: that constraint based works are so often founded on the
principle of producing the most "unconstrained" works--i.e. "Endless,"
"Longest," maybe even someday the "Loudest" poem, like Blue Cheer's
"primitive" (by today's sonic standards) late 60's/early 70's acid hard roc=
k
concept of "Louder than God."

There is also something  of the "inevitbale" about these constarint based
works:

For a moment i thought the Longest Poem might be something like the Burma
Shave jingles (many, oddly, very like some of the poetry of Charles
Bernstein) which stretched from coast to coast--hence a long poem covering
thousands of miles . . .
so this project would have as it's "inevitably" the meeting with the Oceans=
,
something that Lautreamont i a strange way would understand: "O Ocean!"

Another form of this inevitblilty that one finds in these lines i the
"Longest Poem" is they express both a tritieness and a lack of suprise in
resoving by rhyme their dilemans.

That is--do they not read i a small way like the Fates terribly at Work?

Geleth Burgess in a 1968 Art Magaine  article considered the Inevitbale fro=
m
the point of view of the trite and the Bromide in "Are you a Bromide?"
examiniing 48 "genuine cliches," in thre Grand Tradition of Flaubert's
Dictionairre des idees recues (Dictionary of Accepted/Rceived ideas.)
writes:  of,for example, "It's not the moeny, it's the priniple of the
thing" that:
"Iti s not merely because the remark is trite that itis Bromidic.  Ot is
because with the Bromide the remark is INEVITABLE."

(Note: you can find Flaubert's Dictionary coupled with Ambrose Bierce's
Devil's Dictionary being "serialized" letter by letter at
http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com
Also being "serialized" is Edward Bernays's classic work from 1928:
Propaganda, and a series of poems, tales, etc from H.Chase's 1958 book of
homophonic "translations"..I hope to "serialize more such works re language=
,
writing, words letters etc including more texts re the language of our time=
s
which is best expressed as the satuartion of it by/with
Propaganda/advertising objectives. One of the misunderstaning of Corporate
State Fascism as it is devloping in the US's latest formsof Capitalism is
that the distinctions between advertsisng and Propaganda have been broken
down.  A book blurb can be read as an example of this, in which an ideology
of writing is combined an ideology of "buy this book"! And why buy
it--because it is part and parcel of what is good for one--the delicious
fast food delights("You Are What You Eat")  of propaganda-ads. Isn't that
what this poem is about, "The Longest Poem?" And how about any poem one may
read today written in the USA?  Is it not saturated by the ideologies of
production-consumption-more-more-faster-faster--a bizarre echoing of the
terms in Charles Olson's Projective Verse:  One sense impression/breath,
letter, syllable, word, phrase, line following another, fast , faster,
citizen!--etc)
II met once a Ukrainian poet who claimed to have written "The World's
longest Palindrome," helped by the fact that the Ukrainian language is
apparently extraordinarily rich in palindromic possibilities.  This "World'=
s
Longest Palindrome" was either 4 or 8 small pages folded together and done
in fine type.  (forgive the lapse in memory, what's left of it.)
Bob Cobbing, when this pronouncement/announcement of the World's Longest
Palindrome was made clear to him became quite vividly and demonstrably
antagonistic, saying, no no no!!!! HE had written the world's longest
Palindrome because his was just a simple "round" that endless spun around
and around as a form of linguistic perpetual motion machine; thus, to be
sure, being perpetual, it was "The World's Longest Palindrome."
This Palindrome after all, being perpetual, would be the longest in"Eternal
Time," while the "mere" Untrained Palindrome was only long in the number of
words, so that it's duration in time was far shorter.
This conversation itself had a Palindromic quality to it in that a Russian
had to translate from Ukrainian to Russian for another Russian who
translated from Russian to German which I then translated from German to
English for Bob's reply, which then went "backwards" to its "original
source," the Ukrainian poet.
This project by Mr Gheorghe (a Russian born "1005 Romanian) has also
attarateced the attention of CNN, as one may see in the note below from one
of Mr Georghe's sites (he is also a radiot/tv star as well as a school
teacher in Romania.
Constraint based works often are very leaden in their effect, the "concept"
being productive of things only too inevitable, like the thudding
tautologies say of"Conceptual Poetry" of the contemporary American kind
(nothing like Conceptual Poetry in "reality").
I think Mr. Gheorghe's project is an example of the Fun/Funny side of the
Constraint based work's put to use to illustarte as it were the
Inevitability of the Bromidic running amok!

The 'Rencontres Internationales' offers more than a simple presentation
of the works. It introduces an intercultural forum gathering various
guests from all over the world - artists and filmmakers, institutions
and emerging organizations - to testify to their reflections and their
experiences, but also to artistic and cultural contexts that are often
undergoing deep changes.
The 'Rencontres Internationales' reflects specificities and convergences
of artistic practices between new cinema and contemporary art, explores
emerging media art practices and their critical purposes, and makes
possible a necessary time when points of view meet and are exchanged.
The event aims at presenting works to a broad audience, at creating
circulations between different art practices and between different
audiences, as well as creating new exchanges between artists, filmmakers
and professionals.
It seeks to contribute to a reflection on our contemporary culture of
image via a compelling program opened to everyone..

PARIS/BERLIN/MADRID
In 2007, the Rencontres Internationales, which initially took place in
Paris and Berlin, opened up to a third city: Madrid. This event now
constitutes a unique artistic and cultural platform in Europe for
artists, professional networks and various audiences.
The venues in the three cities are in particular in Paris the Centre
Pompidou and the Jeu de Paume national museum, in Berlin the Haus der
Kulturen der Welt, and in Madrid the Reina Sofia National museum, the
auditorium of the Ministry for Culture, the Tabacalera - futur national
centre for visual arts, the Spanish Cinematheque, the CA2M Centro de
Arte Dos de Mayo de la Comunidad de Madrid.
The 'Rencontres Internationales' is a non-commercial event without
competition, supported by French, German, Spanish and international
institutions... [click here >>>

the seventh of the AngelHousePress Series is now on line. In the
essay, "Notes on The Sad Phoenician's Other Woman: Experiencing
Robert Kroetsch's Poetry In A Fever," I discuss my appreciation for
the poetry of Robert Kroetsch and the long poem in general and talk
about how Kroetsch's poem "the Sad Phoenician" inspired me to write a
response poem.

Dear Poeticists,

If you would like to write a review of Nicole Mauro's first
collection, 'The Contortions', please contact me on the back channel
p.brown62@gmail.com

Further information :
From the back cover: 'The Contortions' encourages language to pop and
pulse down the synaptic hallways of our culture. From Freudian free
association to soap opera summaries, from Pangrammic mnemonics to
Rimbaud, these poems are not afraid to breach etiquette and
"dis-remember" the habits of words. Mauro transmits the fantastical
double life of language--what it once was and what it now (happily)
can be--with visual and sonic nerve.--Jena Osman

Thanks,
Best wishes,
Pam Brown

What do you get when you cross edgy poetry with Renaissance music? Find out=
 at =93Figure of Speech,=94 a collaborative performance of poetry, dance, a=
nd music in Toronto.

I=92m incredibly honoured to be performing with Gauri Vanarese, a dancer, a=
nd John Edwards and Hallie Fishel-Verrette, musicians in the Renaissance an=
d Baroque music duo, Musicians in Ordinary, in an evening of artistic colla=
boration organized by Tricia Postle.

Hallie and John have composed settings for several of my sonnets, using tra=
ditional musical forms of the 16th and 17th centuries. Some of these sonnet=
s were inspired by English nursery rhymes, and when I heard Hallie and John=
 perform them at a recent rehearsal, the poetry and music sounded to my ear=
s like a perfect blend.

And for the occasion I also set several of my poems to music, which John, H=
allie, and I will perform in various combinations.

In addition, Hallie and John will accompany dancer Gauri Vanarese in two of=
 her beautiful and evocative choreographed pieces.

It will be a memorable evening. If you will be in Toronto this weekend, ple=
ase come!

"War Rug" - Poetry Film Screening in NY

Date: September 5th, 2009
Time: 7:30 =AD 10:30 p.m.
Location: Upstairs at Erika's, Williamsburg in Brooklyn, NY - for entrance
and address you need to call and RSVP up to the event start time at
917/865-4875.

"War Rug" is based on a work of documentary poetics in the form of a book
length poem. Multiple interwoven narratives explore life within zones of
conflict as viewed through the lens of current warfare. The narratives rang=
e
from passages inspired by journal entries, firsthand accounts, and news
reports to poetic constructs collaged from military doctrine, Freedom of
Information Act released government documents (like CIA interrogation
manuals, and detainee autopsy reports), and numerous other sources. The fil=
m
collages and juxtaposes archival source material with U.S. Military footage
in an exploration of alternative narrative interpretations of the source
text.

David,

I think process/procedure determined digital poems are longest-poems
producing machines.
Or a poem based on a number series stretching infinitely at both ends. Here
a conceptual work leads to a plethora of words -a concept as a word
producing machine.

Did you think of the connection between longest-poems and machines, which
itself a "rationalization" of automatism, this surrealist tool afflicted
with cancer.

Ciao,

Murat

(If you're in the area, you might find this tempting, especially if =
you're interested in ecopoetics and matters concerning land and =
language.)

THE LAND/an art site is hosting a limited-seating, salon-style dinner =
and conversation with William L. Fox, director of the Nevada Museum of =
Art's Center for Art + Environment, on Saturday, September 5, from 6 to =
9 pm at THE LAND/gallery in Albuquerque. Bill is a poet (silence and =
license, One Wave Standing, Reading Sand), independent scholar, =
lecturer, curator, and author of many books on landscape (including =
Driving by Memory, The Void, the Grid and the Sign, Terra Antarctica, =
Driving to Mars, and most recently Aereality: On the World from Above, =
published this year by Counterpoint).
This is a reservations-only, RSPV event, $50 per person, which includes =
dinner and wine. THE LAND is a nonprofit organization, so your $50 is =
tax-deductible.
On Sunday, September 6, beginning at 2 pm, Bill will continue the =
conversation at THE LAND's spectacular outdoor environmental art site =
near Mountainair, New Mexico. He'll be joined by Mark Owens, a poet and =
artist from Portland, OR, who will introduce and discuss a =
language-based environmental project he's been working on for THE LAND. =
The Sunday event is free.
There's more information about THE LAND/an art site at =
www.landartsite.org . Please forward this to anyone you think might be =
interested.

It's like a balloon filled with sand: push it down in one spot, and it
bulges out elsewhere. To be any nameable -est is only to be least
constrained in one direction.

Then again, work all the sand into a single bulge and there isn't a lot of
material left for the rest. Empty latex. Triteness.

      Tibetan boy able to recite world's longest poem after dream

      BEIJING (AFP) - A 13-year-old Tibetan schoolboy has miraculously
memorized large parts of the world's longest poem after having had a
mysterious dream.

      Sitar Doje, a fifth-grader from Qamdo prefecture, had his dream two
years ago and can now recite "The Life of King Gesar" for up to six hours on
end, the Xinhua news agency reported Wednesday.The agency says Tibet has a
long tradition of people waking from sleep inexplicably able to recite the
poem from memory. Most of these "God-taught Masters", however, are much
older than Sitar Doje and are usually illiterate, the agency said.The
lengthy 1,000-year old epic is also cherished by Mongolians and has given
rise to a whole field of study referred to as "Gesarology", Xinhua said.

Subject: Re: The Longest Poem in the World


A Paradox: that constraint based works are so often founded on the
principle of producing the most "unconstrained" works--i.e. "Endless,"
"Longest," maybe even someday the "Loudest" poem, like Blue Cheer's
"primitive" (by today's sonic standards) late 60's/early 70's acid hard rock
concept of "Louder than God."

There is also something  of the "inevitbale" about these constarint based
works:

For a moment i thought the Longest Poem might be something like the Burma
Shave jingles (many, oddly, very like some of the poetry of Charles
Bernstein) which stretched from coast to coast--hence a long poem covering
thousands of miles . . .
so this project would have as it's "inevitably" the meeting with the Oceans,
something that Lautreamont i a strange way would understand: "O Ocean!"

Another form of this inevitblilty that one finds in these lines i the
"Longest Poem" is they express both a tritieness and a lack of suprise in
resoving by rhyme their dilemans.

That is--do they not read i a small way like the Fates terribly at Work?

Geleth Burgess in a 1968 Art Magaine  article considered the Inevitbale from
the point of view of the trite and the Bromide in "Are you a Bromide?"
examiniing 48 "genuine cliches," in thre Grand Tradition of Flaubert's
Dictionairre des idees recues (Dictionary of Accepted/Rceived ideas.)
writes:  of,for example, "It's not the moeny, it's the priniple of the
thing" that:
"Iti s not merely because the remark is trite that itis Bromidic.  Ot is
because with the Bromide the remark is INEVITABLE."

(Note: you can find Flaubert's Dictionary coupled with Ambrose Bierce's
Devil's Dictionary being "serialized" letter by letter at
http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com
Also being "serialized" is Edward Bernays's classic work from 1928:
Propaganda, and a series of poems, tales, etc from H.Chase's 1958 book of
homophonic "translations"..I hope to "serialize more such works re language,
writing, words letters etc including more texts re the language of our times
which is best expressed as the satuartion of it by/with
Propaganda/advertising objectives. One of the misunderstaning of Corporate
State Fascism as it is devloping in the US's latest formsof Capitalism is
that the distinctions between advertsisng and Propaganda have been broken
down.  A book blurb can be read as an example of this, in which an ideology
of writing is combined an ideology of "buy this book"! And why buy
it--because it is part and parcel of what is good for one--the delicious
fast food delights("You Are What You Eat")  of propaganda-ads. Isn't that
what this poem is about, "The Longest Poem?" And how about any poem one may
read today written in the USA?  Is it not saturated by the ideologies of
production-consumption-more-more-faster-faster--a bizarre echoing of the
terms in Charles Olson's Projective Verse:  One sense impression/breath,
letter, syllable, word, phrase, line following another, fast , faster,
citizen!--etc)
II met once a Ukrainian poet who claimed to have written "The World's
longest Palindrome," helped by the fact that the Ukrainian language is
apparently extraordinarily rich in palindromic possibilities.  This "World's
Longest Palindrome" was either 4 or 8 small pages folded together and done
in fine type.  (forgive the lapse in memory, what's left of it.)
Bob Cobbing, when this pronouncement/announcement of the World's Longest
Palindrome was made clear to him became quite vividly and demonstrably
antagonistic, saying, no no no!!!! HE had written the world's longest
Palindrome because his was just a simple "round" that endless spun around
and around as a form of linguistic perpetual motion machine; thus, to be
sure, being perpetual, it was "The World's Longest Palindrome."
This Palindrome after all, being perpetual, would be the longest in"Eternal
Time," while the "mere" Untrained Palindrome was only long in the number of
words, so that it's duration in time was far shorter.
This conversation itself had a Palindromic quality to it in that a Russian
had to translate from Ukrainian to Russian for another Russian who
translated from Russian to German which I then translated from German to
English for Bob's reply, which then went "backwards" to its "original
source," the Ukrainian poet.
This project by Mr Gheorghe (a Russian born "1005 Romanian) has also
attarateced the attention of CNN, as one may see in the note below from one
of Mr Georghe's sites (he is also a radiot/tv star as well as a school
teacher in Romania.
Constraint based works often are very leaden in their effect, the "concept"
being productive of things only too inevitable, like the thudding
tautologies say of"Conceptual Poetry" of the contemporary American kind
(nothing like Conceptual Poetry in "reality").
I think Mr. Gheorghe's project is an example of the Fun/Funny side of the
Constraint based work's put to use to illustarte as it were the
Inevitability of the Bromidic running amok!

"once upon a time, way way back in October 1994, rob mclennan & James
Spyker invented a two-day event called the ottawa small press book fair,
and held the first one at the National Archives of Canada..." Spyker moved
to Toronto soon after the first one, but the fair continues, thanks in
part to the help of generous volunteers, various writers and publishers,
and the public for coming out to participate with alla their love and
their dollars.

address, email, web address, contact person, type of publications, list of
publications (with price), if submissions are being considered & any other

On the 29th of August 2009, there will be a simultaneous festival of
arts & cultural events in communities throughout Scotland.  This
multi-site festival will celebrate the ancient Gaelic culture of one
of the world's truly spectacular places, the Isle of St. Kilda.

http://www.stkilda.eu/st-kilda-day-2009/st-kilda-day-09-full-program

Events are planned in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, Berneray, the
Isle of Harris, the Isle of Lewis, Perth, Argyll, Portree, & North
Uist as well as South Uist.

The Isle of St. Kilda lies 65 kilometres out into the Atlantic to the
west of Scotland's Outer Hebrides.  The Isle of St. Kilda emerged from
a huge volcano more than 50 million years ago & its vertical rock
cliffs are dizzyingly tall.

This festival of the Isle of St. Kilda, sponsored by Gaelic Arts &
Pr=F2iseact nan Ealan, celebrates the place & the people of the Isle,
their lives & their legacy in poetry & music & song, words & images,
storytelling & film.  (BBC ALBA will be showing a number of St. Kilda
related programmes, so watch out for these in the run up to St. Kilda
Day.)

Not sure if I have already posted this here:
New blog post:
"Has British Poetry had any significance since Wordsworth?"

This may seem an outlandish question, but I think it has some force behind it. Of course, the influence of Wordsworth on contemporary British mainstream poetry need hardly be stressed, and I have written extensively about this elsewhere. It is because of this influence that most of the celebrated British poetry of the Twentieth Century tended towards mediocrity when compared to American poetry of the same period.....

TRIBUTE SHOW to DAVID BROMIGE

August 26, 2009   7:00 p.m.

 Katherine Hastings presents a one-hour tribute to the late poet David =
Bromige.  The author of dozens of books and the recipient of many =
literary honors, David Bromige was also a former Poet Laureate of Sonoma =
County, a professor at Sonoma State University, and a mentor to many.  =
His experimental style and sharp wit translated to a large collection of =
work so varied that the poems could easily be mistaken as the work of =
many.  Born in London in 1933, Bromige died in Sebastopol in June of =
this year.  Participating in tonight's program will be his wife, Cecelia =
Belle, their daughter, Margaret, and others.  Recordings of Bromige =
reading his work will also be featured.

 To listen to the program:

 1)       Tune in to KRCB 91.1 FM

2)       Stream live at www.krcb/org

3)       iTunes: Go to Radio/Public/KRCB

Dear Murat
ion an essay on conecptual poetry i wrote that is gigantic production of wo=
rds stands in the way of the concept--
to produce at the Paul Bunyesque dimensions of sheer colossal Million Year =
Planning Programs (a nice pun in there!)
defeats the conceptual by burryin git under masses of word waste . . . over=
-production leading to over flowiing of garbage and then the need of barges=
 and places coerced into storing the endless verbiage . . .
i think mr georghe  in a sense distances himself fro these actions--or does=
 he--more than other so called coneptual poets (plus the work is hialrious =
at first in the sense of poetry =2C poems now entering the Guinbess Books o=
f Records--soon there wil be contest for the most boring poem=2C the worst =
poem=2C the most politically correct poem=2C the poe wuith the most allusis=
ons to onself=2C the absolutely most avanat poem andetc even the most stone=
d or drunk poem!
the DWI poem!=20
one of the problems of conceptual art arises here which is there were shows=
 of it back in the seventies where the verbiage explaining and accompanying=
 in some constrained manner perhaps--all of this verbiage dwarfed the actua=
l object of production consumption and waste
( i can hear freddy fender singing  "wasted days and wasted nights"
for me an aspect of the conceptual works that are truly so=2C is to think o=
f the millions and millions through human history who were a great poet or =
artist and because (most primarily gender) were not allowed to write or pai=
nt or create their own forms of dance=2C musics--
to me these conceptual works which find one when one is finding ones way al=
ong--these are the truly conceptual works because they exist as concepts=2C=
 never realized and become the opposite of conceptual activity and bury it =
in masses of words robert Smithson wrote that a great artists can create ar=
t with a glance=2C and so the work is not trapped i an object=2C art object=
 which has to be judged in terms of value and time--with ignoring the artis=
t's time being paramount-i believe in this very much a i various superconst=
raining places and situation one is allowed to only make conceptual arts in=
 their purely conceptual stages
there are some serious and interesting issues and ideas in thinking with th=
e conceptul in relation to a "work" (in al the punning senses of the word) =
of art--becuase the production contradicts the coneptual--one has to find a=
 different way than the sophistry or jokes bandied about re conceptual poet=
ry.
oh my God NO i didnt think of automatism
the real ineterst in conceptual poertycan be such things as The Literature =
of the No=2C to which i i am realting it in various ways--
i do think though every day  of some great or just painter poet dancers who=
 can't work today in their media nor have been beeen bale to across the spa=
ns of history
this is why an connection with the Literature of the NO is important=2C bec=
ause in a way its NO exists as Protest against the suppression=2C the enfor=
ced no's--
superporouction is just what it always is -superproduction--leading basialy=
 to waste and pollution etc

i read some responses to http://longestpoemintheworld.com that seemed to me
to be missing its charms.

the guy who made longestpoemintheworld.com doesn't even think of it as art,
apparently. i think that's a mistake.

it doesn't have to be sophocles to be art, mind you. there's all sorts of
art from very serious to very silly, from tragic to comic, from high to low,
from popular to cultish, from luddite to high-tech, from entertainment to
the very hard to bear.

in this piece, tweets are selected and pairs of them are selected to form a
longer work and we ourselves try out the notion of different speakers
amongst the lines. we know there's a different writer from line to line, but
part of the interest of the piece is how we find it interesting to suppose
otherwise, in some cases. the point being that what is composed here is not
like a tweet or like journalism or whatever. it's art: it's made
up/together, although the 'material' is the quotidian matter of a large,
real-time, incoming database of micro-blog tweets.

they guy who made this piece is obviously not particularly sophisticated
concerning art or poetry.

but he's on to something.

don't read it expecting typical poetry. consider the source and the method
and the author.

it's surprising that it reads so interestingly.

like, say, some of kenneth koch's book length rhyming works. he was very
playful with his rhyming work.

different from koch's work, also, of course, but the language is similarly
um 'everyday'--although, as with koch's work, the rhyming is a source of
delight and reversal, wonderful justaposition, resolution, and so on--all
the magic of what rhyme can do to two lines.

longestpoemintheworld.com was not even done by a serious poet. so, you know,
don't get yer shirt in a knot. it is a literary piece of net art, though.
and a surprisingly good one, all things considered. as i said, he's
apparently on to something that the serious poets can learn from and put in
their bag of tricks, in some sense.

if you read it and all you can discern is the trite, well, that's a trite
reading.

the tweets are often trite, it's true. and the result of the rhyme amongst
trite tweets is trite. but keep in mind that these things that are written
via algorithm are such that we expect to 'throw away' stuff and look for the
more interesting results. the interesting couplets are often quite poignant.
or flashingly humourous.

the work sometimes involves real pain, troubles, and situations and just a
whole rainbow of attitudes toward them.

one of the reasons i have put so much work into dbCinema is i am fascinated
with the possibs involved in image search. you type something in and bingo
there's a thousand (somehow) related images to what you typed in. images by
people from around the world. a kind of a crazy mixed up global
langu(im)agical lookup.

there's something of the same spirit of that crazy mixed up but all too
human collectivity in the method and madness of
http://longestpoemintheworld.com . it gives us a strong sense of
significance beyond the trite but certainly also involving the trite.

don't be too scared of it. be not afraid of these spooky things. they are
like wind chimes only not the spirit of the wind but our spirit blowing
through the machine.

I've tried reading Geoffrey Hill. According to some, he's the most significant poet in the English language.
But Elliot provided footnotes. Hill seems to think that everyone has a
degree from either Cambridge or Oxford, or perhaps his poetry is only
meant for those endowed with said degrees. Not that I mind the degree,
but really, at least provide the "common" reader with footnotes.

Dear all,
Many thanks to those of you who responded to my query about examples of and
critical writings on homophonic translation.  I'd love to hear further, if
any more of you have thoughts.

Currently, I'm looking for books, essays, and articles--good, hardcore,
worthwhile, useful pedagogically--on the theory of lyric poetry, from any
period of history.  (No such thing as too well known or obvious--and even
poems that theorize the lyric would be great.)  Works on contemporary
experimental poetry would be especially appreciated, but please treat this
request expansively.  Anything on the web, too.

All best,

Judith Goldman

The footnotes to Geoffrey Hill are the Oxford English Dictionary. He meant =

lti-layered=A0word play, and he always gives you some kind of hint that let=
s you into the poem.=0A=0A=A0=0AFor example, the hint words in "September S=

 look that up (it's a cyanide gas invented by a German Jew as a pesticide -=
 he won the=A0Nobel for it in 1918--=A0used in the Nazi death chambers) the=

a degree, as much as the kind of mind that gets into crossword puzzles. Som=
e people find this offputting - if you can think of the whole process as a =
game, does that diminish the power of talking about the Holocaust? But Hill=
 would argue that language tends toward simplicity, and that linguistic ove=
rsimplification is=A0a kind of fascism. Struggling through the possible mea=

Dear Murat
ion an essay on conecptual poetry i wrote that is gigantic production of wo=
rds stands in the way of the concept--
to produce at the Paul Bunyesque dimensions of sheer colossal Million Year =
Planning Programs (a nice pun in there!)
defeats the conceptual by burryin git under masses of word waste . . . over=
-production leading to over flowiing of garbage and then the need of barges=
 and places coerced into storing the endless verbiage . . .
i think mr georghe=C2=A0 in a sense distances himself fro these actions--or=
 does he--more than other so called coneptual poets (plus the work is hialr=
ious at first in the sense of poetry , poems now entering the Guinbess Book=
s of Records--soon there wil be contest for the most boring poem, the worst=
 poem, the most politically correct poem, the poe wuith the most allusisons=
 to onself, the absolutely most avanat poem andetc even the most stoned or =
drunk poem!
the DWI poem!=20
one of the problems of conceptual art arises here which is there were shows=
 of it back in the seventies where the verbiage explaining and accompanying=
 in some constrained manner perhaps--all of this verbiage dwarfed the actua=
l object of production consumption and waste
( i can hear freddy fender singing=C2=A0 "wasted days and wasted nights"
for me an aspect of the conceptual works that are truly so, is to think of =
the millions and millions through human history who were a great poet or ar=
tist and because (most primarily gender) were not allowed to write or paint=
 or create their own forms of dance, musics--
to me these conceptual works which find one when one is finding ones way al=
ong--these are the truly conceptual works because they exist as concepts, n=
ever realized and become the opposite of conceptual activity and bury it in=
 masses of words robert Smithson wrote that a great artists can create art =
with a glance, and so the work is not trapped i an object, art object which=
 has to be judged in terms of value and time--with ignoring the artist's ti=
me being paramount-i believe in this very much a i various superconstrainin=
g places and situation one is allowed to only make conceptual arts in their=
 purely conceptual stages
there are some serious and interesting issues and ideas in thinking with th=
e conceptul in relation to a "work" (in al the punning senses of the word) =
of art--becuase the production contradicts the coneptual--one has to find a=
 different way than the sophistry or jokes bandied about re conceptual poet=
ry.
oh my God NO i didnt think of automatism
the real ineterst in conceptual poertycan be such things as The Literature =
of the No, to which i i am realting it in various ways--
i do think though every day=C2=A0 of some great or just painter poet dancer=
s who can't work today in their media nor have been beeen bale to across th=
e spans of history
this is why an connection with the Literature of the NO is important, becau=
se in a way its NO exists as Protest against the suppression, the enforced =
no's--
superporouction is just what it always is -superproduction--leading basialy=
 to waste and pollution etc

I took a wonderful course on this very topic as a grad student, from
Prof. David Wellbery.  We read a lot of structuralist stuff, Jacobsen
and Saussure, Michael Riffaterre, Walter Benjamin (on some motifs in
baudelaire), Herder, schiller, the groupe Mu, de Man, Geoffrey Hartmann,
i think J. Culler, Karl-Heinz Stierle, Hans-Robert Jauss, etc., Nicholas
Greimas, Alexander Baumgarten, etc. I would also suggest the Preface to
Lyrical Ballads...
not to go too shameless on you, but some of the stuff in /Poetry and
Cultural Studies: A Reader/ is pertinent...
or I wonder if Wellbery (now at U-Chicago, your stomping ground) still
has a syllabus on hand...it's from the 1980s, before computers, so he
may not.

Dear Judith,

The book I've found most helpful for my understanding of lyric is Allen
Grossman's *The Sighted Singer*. The book consists of three parts, of which
the first two are interviews between Grossman and his former student (now
poet and scholar) Mark Halliday. The book's examples are mainly from the
British tradition and the American 20th century, but Grossman derives his
theory of lyric with reference to classical models. Grossman's essays in *The
Long Schoolroom* and, more recently, *True-Love: Essays on Poetry and Value*,
give some examples of the theory at work in the reading of various poets.

Another great, and very teachable, article is Jonathan Culler's short piece,
"Apostrophe." [Diacritics 7.4 (Winter 1977): 59-69.]

Finally,* The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics* article on
lyric is a nice overview of lyric poetry's development as a genre from
Greece to the present, and I mined its extensive bibliography of works on
poetic theory in composing lists for my Ph.D exams.

Best,

John

this week 's gallery feature the work of david chirot

This is a very amazing project of/
<http://thenewpostliterate.blogspot.com/>Michael Jacobson's' in which
each week he features a different Visual Poet,
Artist, Poet's pieces made with a sense of conveying  their consideration of
"what IS the new post literature" and also just what is asemic writing, or
the role of asemic writing-- in relation with this?
Since everyone may well have different approaches quite various and wide
ranging, the way Michael is giving a week each to the works helps present
this swarming cosmos of possibilities--as an open one, rather than an
apriori categorically divided and defined "New Post Literature" which is
instead an area of excavation, investigation divigation  and Anarkeyological
Expo- and Explosivagation--

another really good piece is eve sedgwick's A Poem is Being Written,
which posits the lyric as instrument and representation of bourgeois
family discipline, through the word "enjambement" which, in typical
brilliant fashion, she sexualizes as straddling and being spanked.

Have a look at a study of the lyric by W. R. Johnson, /The Idea of Lyric
/(University of California Press, 1982).  He's a classics scholar, and
such a graceful thinker and writer.  There is David Lindley's, /Lyric,/
published by Methuen in 1985, and Adena Rosmarin's /The Power of Genre,/
University of Minnesota Press, 1985. Just noticed how these 3 texts saw
publication during the ascendancy of the New Narrative.    Don' forget
Wordworth's "Preface to the Lyrical Ballads."

Best,
Gloria Frym

Dear folks

I have just rejoined this list after a lengthy absence. It is good to be
back!! Some of you may be interested in the journal soundRite, a journal of
new media writing and sound at  http://soundsrite.uws.edu.au/ co-edited by
Roger Dean and me. Volume One is accumulating and so far includes work by
Jason Nelson, Nannette Wylde and  Daniel Blinkhorn, and a collaboration by
Roger Dean, Anne Brewster and me. See the more extended blurb below.


The journal  soundsRite, at  http://soundsrite.uws.edu.au/, was established
in 2009 at the University of Western Sydney and is co-edited by Prof. Hazel
Smith (Writing and Society Research Group, UWS)  and Prof. Roger Dean (MARCS
Auditory Laboratories, UWS). soundsRite is online and open access and
publishes selected new media work which includes words or sound or both.  It
features generative, interactive and multi-channel sound pieces; writing
which is kinetic, generative or interactive; and  pieces which combine text,
sound and image. The soundsRite site also archives an earlier multimedia
journal, infLect, founded and edited by Hazel Smith at the University of
Canberra (2003-2007). The focus of infLect was new media writing.

MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=WINDOWS-1252; format=flowed; delsp=yes
Content-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable

I am organizing a panel for the Northeast Modern Language =20
Association's annual conference, April 7-11, 2010, in Montreal. (These =20=

are the same dates as AWP, I know, but in the event there's someone on =20=

this list who won't be going to AWP, but might have something for =20
NeMLA, I am posting this here. I am just organizing the panel. I will =20=

be at AWP.) Here's the call:

Non-Western Literatures in Translation

The act of literary translation raises by definition the question of =20
how the target culture frames the language and culture of the text to =20=

be translated. This issue, often unexamined, can determine not only =20
which texts from which languages are chosen for translation, but also =20=

what the relationship between the translation and the original text is =20=

understood to be. Nineteenth century British and American translators =20=

of classical Iranian poetry, for example, often portrayed themselves =20
quite explicitly as improving on what they understood to be the =20
=93oriental=94 defects of the poets they were working with. This stance =20=

finds its roots in British colonial rule of India, where Persian was =20
the language of the Moghul courts, and the idea that, if only the =20
British could understand Persian and the psychology it embodied, they =20=

could make themselves more effective colonial rulers. The history of =20
the translation into English of other non-Western literatures--=20
including those we now consider Western, like classical Greek--is =20
fraught with similar kinds of bias, as are contemporary assumptions =20
about the value non-Western literatures hold for us. Keeping in mind =20
the fact that less than 3% of all the books published in the United =20
States in any given year are literary translations, and the fact that =20=

publishing at all levels is a business that both creates and responds =20=

to its market, this panel seeks to examine the issues confronting the =20=

translation of non-Western literatures, from classical to =20
contemporary, into English. While we would like the emphasis to be on =20=

languages that are not already commonly translated (Japanese and =20
Chinese, among others), we welcome proposals concerning any non-=20
Western language. We encourage a variety of perspectives--from authors =20=

of texts that have been translated (or texts in search of a =20
translation), translators, scholars, publishers--and would prefer to =20
have papers addressing a range of time periods. Topics might include =20
the linguistic and cultural challenges of translating non-Western =20
languages, what we learn from the history of the translation of a =20
given work or body of work, translation success stories, the =20
challenges of publishing literary translations of non-Western =20
languages, or why a given work or body of work deserves more =20
attention--scholarly and otherwise--than it has been given. We also =20
look forward to being surprised by ideas that have not occurred to us.

Please respond to me backchannel: richard.newman@ncc.edu

Less than a year after Pearl Harbor and within the first week of
entering school, my wife, who grew up in a small village on Big Island,
recalls being taught the following school song,

The Pearl Harbor Song

I remember Pearl Harbor
As we go to meet the foe.
Let's remember Pearl Harbor
As we did the Alamo.
We will always remember
How they died for liberty.
Lets remember Pearl Harbor
And go on to victory!

She was five-years old at the time. It was sung every morning, right
after the Pledge of Allegiance. It has a rather charming , slightly
haunting, little melody. If I didn't know better, I would have said it
was a Roy Orbison tune ('Crying'? It's 'Over'?.)

I wonder if anyone knows, or can find out, the counterpart to these
lyrics that was being sung by the school children of Japan at that time?
I do know that one group of young Japanese children from the Mie
Prefecture had hung an American soldier's uniform from a tree and would
throw rocks at it as they passed by on their way to and from school.
But, surely, they must have had some 'official' song that they sang each
morning under the rising sun (and did they also have a 'Pledge of
Allegiance',  I don't know?)  - thanx in advance,  red

Dear Judith Goldman:

forgive me if these have been mentioned already

*Edgar Allan Poe: "Philosophy of Composition"*
one of the most influential essays/theories on poetry internationally of the
last 150+ years
*Vladimir Mayakovsky:  How Are Verses Made?*
       Maaykovsky, a great lyric poet in his Futurist phase, now a Marxist
Poet of the Revolution--writes a great first section on the waysin which he
composes from an iinitial sound or beat onward, and that material is
everywhere--not unlike WC Williams' "a poem can be made of anything" but of
course with a different direction in mind than WCW--"a poem to be a poem
after all must have a direct"--wcw)
the later parts of the book are an attack on thelyricism of Sergei Esenin's
suicide poem--by attacking thelyricism Mayakiovsky proovides an excellent
guidebook to the lements of lyricism--and completes the work with a poemof
his own addressed to Esenin's (ironically to be sure Mayakovksy also
committed suicide, for which he had berated Esenin; lyricism won in the end"
The Boat of Love has Crashed"--)

Kurt Schwitters' short statements re the formof lyricism one finds in his
sound poetry and esp "Anna Blue"

"We aspire to Birdsong"  and a multitude of other pieces on this--by Bob
Cobbing--the lyricism of pure sound poetry

Henri Chopin's essays &  statements--another exploration of the lyric in
terms of sound poetry

Paul Celan--among his speeches in the 1960's and statements by him, a
profound meditation on the lyric poem

Also texts by Willis Barnstone and Ann Carson for example on the Greek lyric
poetry, especially on Sappho but also re Archilocus--one of the great
inventers of Western poetry's history and meters, forms--
The Greeks, after all, invented Lyric poetry--personally i always find
Sappho to be the greatest of al lyric poets, even in a translation and
infrgaments, there is no voice, no lyric voice that is so piercing,so
intense, so specific and of "sweetbitter eros"

I don't know specific examples, but there must be some good works re
Shakespeare's lyrical poetry in the Sonnets.esp.

Also, scattered among the plays one finds some statements of "Shakespeare's"
(vis his characters) ideas of the lyric--

I am sure this must have been noted, but Garicia Lorce's essay on"Duende"

There are writings in some collections of works in which, by attacking the
lyric, Nicanor Parra brings to it a good form of definition and outline,
against this impulse, particularly in Spanish Language poetry to which he
counters with "Anti-Poetry"

A great many poets express ideas and their own examples of lyricism in their
works and scattered writings, notes--for examples, Jack Spicer, Stephen
Jonas, Leroi Jones/Amiri Baraka

The importance of the Greeks Rimbaud recognizes in the letter to Izambard in
which he says the poerty of the Future wil be like the Greeks, except that
in it poetry will precede action, the opposite of Aristotle's formulation,
and on the most influentil ideas on poets such as Charles Olson's Projective
Verse, in which the poem is to be the action.
I believe Rimbaud actually lif=ved this: his poetry and prosepoems describe
ahead of time very precisely much of his life after he stopped writing
poetry.
As Rimbaud told his mother, when she asked him what "Saison en enfer" (A
Season in Hell)--meant--
(afte rall, she had the right to this having paid for the book's publication
, most of it--)
"It means what it says literally and in every sense."

An interesting question to pose is, beyond the technical, what are the
aspects of lyricism which contemporary American poets are "against"?
What is the idea of the lyric? That's why one starts with the Greeks, who
invented. The significance among a great many, is that for the first time in
Western poetry an actaul specific individual is "giving voice" "aspiring to
bird song"--
and which for me is why many forms of Sound Poetry are related with the
Lyric--
Also: is the Lyric purely "about a self"? Isn't it far more complex than
this? (One may see how complex by the doubts about it  by poets such as
Parra and Mayakovsky, who are moving aggsint the wieghtof the hegemonioc
impulse in their cultures of a certain time period, as the societies
themselves are in upheaval--)
Are not many poems and poetries with claims to the lyric not really Lyric in
the strict sense of this?
Doesn't the Lyric have to have a very tensile tactile strength to it that so
called lyric poets in vast numbers lack?
The real challenge, as celan notes, is to use a language which has undergone
an extremity and yet survived, found itself, existing, and then--to work
with this surviving an mutable language--

To me Celan's writings are a stark contrast to the statement of Adorno's so
often misquoted re that after Auschwitz there can be nor more lyric poetry
--or might there not be, after all?  ,iI's continued underground existence
--the great lyricist Orpheus' journey to the Underworld, land of the
dead--during extremities so that it is not dead but endures as Celan writes,
as a changed language yet--not incapable of the lyric--
.Celan in some aspects is taking up where perhaps Trakl literally "left off"
in his great works of lyricism confronting the insanity of slaughter in the
First World War's Eastern Front.
also as a question--
why is the Lyric poem the longest continually existing form of poetry in
Wester literature since the Greeks?
is it in part due to its relationships often with extremities?
and that extremities are a good bit of life's living?
"Between grief and nothing, I will take grief"
--Faulkner, last words of The Wild Palms

"The Synesthetic Plan of Chicago" is an art installation that has been at
the Chicago Cultural Center for the past three months. Parts of the show
have traveled to satellite locations throughout Chicago, such as Mess Hall,
Faie African Art Gallery, the Hyde Park Art Center, and Myopic Bookstore.
SPC will be up at the Cultural Center for another month, and then it will
travel to the Columbia College Library and Little Black Pearl Art & Design
Center. You are invited to check out SPC, if you haven't done so already!

"Putting Layers on the Onion" is the installation piece I made for SPC. It
has involved contributions from people who have interacted with this piece,
such as these --

Being really young
in red overalls
and cranking the gadgets
at the Science Museum.

Remember the alewives
along the beaches? I'll

poetry is in us deep.

long before we could even think straight, there was the repetition, on
certain occassions, of the same sounds.

first it was just when we were in pain.

or in pleasure.

and that was language.

you can see it in cats and dogs. dunno what level of understanding they
have--but we were there once. on certain occassions they make the same
sounds. and that is communicative to us and amongst themselves, and it is a
kind of language, but it hasn't got the sort of consciousness to it we
associate with language.

but the point is that's where we were with language long ago. and poetry
still keeps in touch with that sort of language consciousness. via
repetition, sound poetry, the primal orality of some types of language +
mouthiness.

This is an oldie, but no one has replied, so:

Hugh Kenner once told me that LZ originally prepared an idex to "A" which
listed ONLY instances of "a" and "the" -- whether it listed all of them I
know not, but I doubt it -- and Celia said that was totally inadequate as an
index -- I think she was the one who then compiled the Index we now have.
Maybe Paul Zukofsky knows. Maybe Mark Scroggins knows too. Mark?

More interesting, perhaps, would be to follow up the index entries and
figure out why those instances were worthy of inclusion while others
weren't, but I must say I have better things to do right now. Anyone want to
get a PhD doing it?

Subject: Question about Zukofsky's "A" Index

Does anyone know why Zukofsky didn't index every instance of "a" or "the" or
