For what it's worth, there are no records for a _Sandia Review of Books_ in
either the OCLC or RLIN databases, two huge bibliographic utilities
containing information on the holdings of literally thousands of US and
non-US libraries. This doesn't constitute a definitive answer, of course --
there are plenty of micromags and fanzines that almost no libraries acquire
-- but before sending a copy of the book, you could I suppose request a
sample copy of the journal.

I think I can clarify this mystery, by noting that Dean's meaning was
neither of the above-noted possibilities -- for the reasn that the
"David" to whom he referred was not David Bromige but rather, the
undersigned.  I had, indeed, offered some comment regarding Dean's
experimental use of Java-script (hence, the "reJavanated" et cet).

For sake of balancing the slate, I, too, David, have occasionally
looked with a start of apprehension at some Poetics posting that
makes mention of David's comments -- but only for a split second; for
it generally becomes clear that the David in question is you, rather
than me.  This seems to have been the rarer instance where the
reverse situation proved in evidence.

Perhaps someone will at some point make reference to the hymnist who
is our namesake & prototype, and then we can both look befuddled in
sync or in tandem . . .

till then, yours, &c.,

David

Don't think this made it.  Sorry if it's a repeat.

Came across the following today.  Thought it was apposite to
the recent flurries here re avant-garde, new directions and
the Theroux/Ashberry businness.  My reading is that language
and, by context, poetry, is the "avant-garde", as per Plato,
in its ability to let in what doesn't fit the rules, what is
antithetical to historicism.  Comments?

because of its power to germinate systems antithetical to

Historicism, while allying itself with writing, knowing its

projective character (translation: stability).  Taking
language truly seriously as a partly known, partly
unknowable form of energy is instantly recognizable to
historicism as an antithetical challenge." _ Piombino,

>

> was the first interview?

Interesting question.  Arguably, the form we know as the interview is
at least *related* to the ancient form known as the dialogue.

Sources in extant literature for the latter importantly include, of
course, the Platonic (or Socratic) dialogues of ancient Greece, as
well as the forest-dialogues (somewhat kindred, perhaps -- I don't
know that I've seen the comparison explored) that form at least a
major portion of the Sanskrit philosophical texts known as the
Upanishads (also called the Vedanta -- the "end" or "completion" of
the Vedas [scriptures]).

This likely doesn't address your question directly, but possibly adds
at least a glow of long-shadow context.  Also somewhat anecdotally
(or let's say tangentially), the form of the interview in the modern
sense was very curiously pre-dated -- i.e., moved back in time -- by
Meredith Monk in her film *Book of Days*, which included what
amounted to t.v.-style interviews of various figures in a midaeval
European city.

Having reached the end of relevance, I await the "real answer" too.

Hmm --Pierre Joris answers this electro-interview question thus:

> Hmm, on the more frivolous side, Plato innerviewing Socrates, & on
> the more serious side, Herodotus interviewing everyone to find out
> what really happened. Pierre

I wonder if the (or a) next step down the primrose path toward
today's Charlie Rose & The Paris Review might be discerned (or
discoverable) in the traditions (midaeval?) of courts of law,
jurisprudence -- the interrogation, the interview of witnesses, and
whatever may have antedated our contemporary formal traditions of
direct & cross-examination, &c.

Since the Writ of Habeas Corpus dates back to -- what? -- the 13th
century or something, one wonders how far back one finds those
(possibly related) formalities  . . .

(as is well known [sorta or not-quite relatedly], the Petrarchan
sonnet is alleged to have origins in the formal jargon of law . . . )

happy near-autumn,

Seems to me language-as-word is only one facet of a unitary/divided
meta-language of the mind, which includes words, which includes "the
State", etc.  And setting up who's "the enemy" is the oldest chessgame
in the world - nothing avant-garde about it.  It's called "us vs. them"
and it's about projecting psychological conflicts inherent in human nature.
The idea that "writers" or "language artists" are avant-garde because
they're breaking down stilted social codes ignores the fact that words
and the book have been used as weapons of control, revenge, self-
glorification, order, resentment, heirarchy, etc. etc. since the slaves
of Assurbanipal or whoever started pressing wedges in the clay.
Are these the historicists?  They're the avant-garde in language tools.

well folks i've at length had the time/space to explore the double issue of
diacritix on poetry and community that i made such snotty remarks about
(w/o having read it) earlier in the spring.  i found it --esp the
introduction by jonathan monroe, which i think i'll have occasion to assign
in classes or draw from in my future endeavors --engaging and smart, tho'
some of the articles were over my head.  thanks for the opportunity to make
up for earlier brattiness.  maria d

Subject:      my father among the earlier paparazzi?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

        My father, Harold Bromige, worked all his life for Gaumont-British
Newsreels, from 1919 on. While I am sure he would be shocked at the conduct
of today's scandalsheet photogs, he had many tales of "cutthroat"
competition among the different newsreel companies, e.g. when one outfit
had secured excloo rights to film a cricket match, the opposiiton rented
second storey rooms facing their cameras & flashed mirrors into the lenses.
My father filmed the-then Prince of Wales (later, the Duke of Windsor)
coming unglued going over a jump in a steeplechase. The Prince came up to
my father & sd, "I dont think the British public wish to see their future
king falling off a horse. Kindly remove the film from yr camera." (I was
only a boy when first told this story & exclaimed "You didnt Dad did you?"
"A Royal request is an order" my father told me.)

Thereafter, on several occasions when he had been assigned to film the
Prince, my father was removed by security men & the driver of the G-B van
had to shoot the footage instead. And once, in Paris, my father was
arrested, plucked from his perch atop the G-B van, although never
charged...but missed the parade in which the Prince was participating.

I realize this-all is rather abt the victimization of a photog by royalty
than vice versa. But there were other anecdotes he told, a la the
mirror-flashing, of jostling competition among the companies. The ropes
holding a balloon in place, from which one outfit was filming sports, were
cut through and the thing set adrift--dangerous business.  His boss once
kidnapped Chaplin as a publicity stunt. Chaplin went along with it, i
guess. But events were staged--"nonevents" in Boorstein's phrase, although
done to tell the truth of an actual event. Or sometimes the truth. During
WW2, competition among the companies ceased, resources were pooled, and
propaganda became the order of the day. Defeats were turned into hardwon
victories.

But compared to "La Dolce Vita" et seq, pretty tame stuff. For a fictional
antecedent, a memory occurs of "Citizen Kane," "found in love nest", was
that the headline? Hoist by his own petard?  Where is the line between
muckraking & "Project Censored"? I mean where, legally, could one be drawn?


About a boycott of those checkout counter mags, I am always hoping to see
consumers turning on the hand that feeds them. But please spare Weekly
World News, which recently reported that the dying words of an alien
spaceman before he crashed at Roswell were "My wife...my children...God
forgive me for my sins."

But this, & other stuff I was abt to say, go 'way beyond an answer to the
posted question, so I'll stop.  David

spanning David B.'s illuminating, if chilling, capture and arrest and
Henry's thoughtful, if chilling, indictment both, on the illusion of the
primacy of art, I am reminded of this observation from Louis Mumford:

"Psychologically healthy people have no need to indulge fantasies of
absolute power; nor do they need to come to terms with reality by
inflicting self-mutilation and prematurely courting death. But the critical
weakness of an over-regimented institutional structure--and almost by
definition 'civilization' was over-regimented from the beginning--is that
it does not tend to produce psychologically healthy people."

"The rigid division of labor and the segregation of castes produce
unbalanced characters, while mechanical routine normalizes--and
rewards--those compulsive personalities who are afraid to cope with the
embarrassing riches of life."

The kings no longer need hide their crimes. They have only to demonstrate
that flashbulbs, O-rings and the Times alike produce jobs.

against Henry's remarks on "language artists", no matter where the shifting
frontlines are thought to be, there is perhaps only illusion to be played,
one pawn at a time.


A long forgotten healer's art
of speech made fast within
that string the bow tips of the heart
to sing the quivering

        Of reed, the flute; of string, the lyre
        to warrior was given;
        heaven prepares and earth provides,
        the dead divide the living.

Warrior!,  stretch upon thy deed
        bend thy bow to fit thy word
        take such strength from dexterous reed,
        in that, be what is heard.

I wonder now if illusions ever served as useful nostrums?

Habeas Corpus-the Crown vs. Anthony Ashley Cooper, Lord Shaftsbury, 1681. A
real interesting story, but for another occasion. Shaftsbury was the leader
of the not-so-loyal proto-Whig opposition to Charles I. He's the villain of
Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel, and he was the head of the corporation
that founded the colonys of North and South Carolina. Charleston, SC, lies
between the Ashly and Cooper rivers, both named for him.

David,
yes, i agree, do not turn away the Weekly World News. the WWN is the Night
Stand With Dick Dietrick of tabloids, a terrific parody of the genre. the
stories that they make up are obviously fabricated and sometimes funny as
hell (as David points out), though they do throw in actual (sensational)
stories. i particularly like the right-wing columnist Ed Anger(!), who is
always "pig-biting mad" or "madder than Teddy Kennedy at an AA meeting."

I fully agree. I love the Weekly World News. You can tell that they are
serious because they print in black and white. In the WWN it was revealed
for the first time that there was a World War II bomber found on the moon;
and later a number of WW2 fighters found on Mars! Later it was revealed
that humans had not gone to the moon, that the landings were faked. Once
they ran a story about giant fish in Chinese rivers that leaped up and
swallowed unwary horses that walked too close to the edge of the water. I
get all my knowledge of the world from that paper. Boycott ehe rest of
them, though. I mean, I hardly ever know who those people are that are
mocked on the front pages.

I can't tell if this is jaded dismisal or agreement.  In any case the quote
is Piombino's.
I neither defended the "avant-garde" or attacked Theroux.  I intended to
juxtapose the
quote and the recent threads to point out that this is, as it long has been,
a "boundary
land" of conflict with shifting names and combatants.  The problem for me is
that there
is no adequate term for this conflict.  I was seeking some clarification and
ideas.
Perhaps in doing so I was not as clear as I should have been.  As you say,
"setting up
who's 'the enemy' is the oldest chessgame."

While Greek dialogues certainly qualify as antecedents to the form, they
tend to read more as drama-less plays than what I would think of as an
interview.

Which of course raises a question of form:  what makes an interview
different from a dialogue or a court hearing?

Like a dialogue, an interview purports to be the questions, answers and
discussion recorded over a specific period of time between two or more
parties.  It is an exchange of information, but there seems to be an
element of discovery, of uncertainty, which is missing from most dialogues
I'm familiar with.  Interviews are unpredictable: the person asking the
questions does not know the answers, and hopefully the person providing the
answers does not know the questions.

Of course there is a measure of artifice in the form, as anyone who's had
to transcibe one quickly realizes.

Most of the Greek dialogues are pretty contrived.  The speakers resemble,
if they are not in fact, fictional characters who exist only to provide
philosophical points.  Dialogues "go" somewhere.  They point to the essay
as the fiction of characters are replaced with a singular authorial voice.

Court hearings and inquisitions take the dialogue into reality.  There is
no doubt that the person asking the questions and the person on the stand
or rack are real.  But court transcripts don't strike me as full-fledged
interviews either.  With the exception of public inquisitions/confessions,
they seldom leave the courtroom.  They are also beside the point: they are
evidence which is used to render judgement.  The judgements are what really
matter in the court, they are what gets read and absorbed into the general
body of law, not the interviews or other pieces of evidence.

So I think the interview must have started with journalism, and it is there
the first true interview will be found.

PS: Paparzzi probably sprung up once cameras became light enough to take
snapshots (turn of the century), newspapers could print photos cheaply
(half-tone printing, 1881), and notions of mass celebrity became
commonplace.  Just post WWI is my guess, with Valentino as the first
victim.

Having missed the Theroux/Ashbery thread perhaps I only added confusion.
I was responding directly to the paragraph from N. Piombino, not to its
connection with previous discussion. My point was I disagreed with the
idea that the nature of language in itself sets up a division between
"the State" and the "historicists" who uphold it on the one hand and
writers on the other.  To me this simply romanticizes already-established
ideas of who or what the avant-garde is (as I put it in a post a few
weeks ago - cynically - the "avant-garde" is that portion of the writing
world that already has a foothold in the "canon").  The problem for me
with the established "experimental" poetry community is that it justifies
itself in academic circles using definitions of "language" I don't accept.
See, for example, Rosmarie Waldrop's talk in the Diacritics issue that
Maria Damon mentioned.  Waldrop pushes the notion that avant-garde
postmodern writing in 20th century (Stein, Zukofsky, many others she
quotes & alludes to) represents an historical shift in style & method
from Romanticism, & bases this on a borrowing from formalist
criticism - the Jakobson axes of metaphor and metonymy, or vertical
identity and horizontal combination. The new style represents an openness
to both language-as-origin and the material, social world by emphasizing
COMBINATION over symbol and hierarchy. This shift in style may be
inarguable, and may represent a real experimental-artistic alternative
to mainstream individualist approaches to signature style.  But the
definition of poetic language underpinning it here is not one I can
go along with.

Thanks, David, for that wonderful anecdote. You ask, quite properly, if
somewhat rhetorically,"Where is the line between muckraking & "Project
Censored"? I mean where, legally, could one be drawn?" I'm afraid the
attempt to stop present abuses would only lead to further and more serious
abuses, providing yet another  cloak for those up to no-good to conceal
their skulduggery even more effectively.

Interesting about the re-staging of events done by Gaumont. The earliest
instance I know of this sort of thing dates from 1898, when the Vitagraph
Picture Co. "re-enacted" the taking of San Juan Hill by TR. The idea was
TR's and he got it from Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show, which itself
popularized re-enactments. The film fixed in the public's mind the notion
that mounted soldiers could successfully charge uphill against machine gun
emplacements, which of course did not happen.

So, the abuse has been around since the inception of the medium, rather in
the same way that lying has been around since people mastered speech, and
later, writing.  One could make an argument that tabloids exist in relation
to the mainstream press in the same way that organized crime acts as a
mirror for bourgeois values. The former is merely the shadow cast by the
latter. To demonize the former is to miss the point - which for me, anyway,
is that all modes of data transmission are subject to corruption. The
mainstream press is able to defend itself against charges of vulgarity, as
if that were the most heinous crime it could commit, but when it comes to
coddling corporate interest, censoring stories, or acting as apologists for
official policies that are clearly causing real harm and grief to thousands
of people, mum's the word.

Are you sure it doesn't go the other way?  This is not entirely facetious:
consider that the early press resembled tabloids more than the NY Times,
and that the founders of aristocracies often were those who could terrorize
and control more effectively than others.

You raise a very good point Judy and it may well be that that was the case.
The first newscasters were town criers, usually in the service of the local
ruler. When the printing press was invented, the veil of darkness was not
lifted with the kind of majestic sweep we typically imagine since the powers
that be rushed to print their own versions of things so as to keep a firm
grip on the reins, just as you say. So maybe a better analogy would be one
that cast tabloids as atavistic versions of the modern press which still
thrive because of people's hunger for _narrative_ in whatever form.

     Thanks for the clarification.  I'll leave it to Nick to respond about
the quote if he chooses.  My interest is in the area between "history" and
"writing" as that's where the _action_ is.

interesting.  However, to trace the teleology (if that's the word) --
the process of origins over time -- is not the same as sketching the
present relationship.  That is, what was, in a prior era, central,
can become, on a later stratum, peripheral, once the centrality of
origins has been displaced by more refined offspring (or spinoff).

To schematize:

The primordial proto-mafiosi
   is first supplanted by

The shining civilized aristocracy
   which is then shadowed by

The renascent mafia (mirroring
   the aristocrats & simultaneously
   carrying ancient memory of
   primordial originality intact)

Perhaps this 3-level pattern can be observed rather broadly, in a
variety of applications.

Likewise WWII--the raising of the flag at Iwo Jima, MacArthur's landing in
the Phillipines. Also common to rewrite history thru the editing of
otherwise honest film footage. Hitler didn't dance a jig for the camera

We want to encourage you to subscribe to Chain.

Chain is broke. We have $.58 in our bank account right now.

Word is that one can not run a journal using subscribers as the primary
source of funding. (I just had two people tell me that this week alone.)

But there doesn’t seem to be any other way to do it. Grants are
disappearing. We’ve unfortunately learned that we can not rely on
bookstore sales in any way. With the exception of SPD, our distributors
barely pay us what little they do owe us (they tend to be going out of
business right now any way; the returns from large corporate bookstores
are killing them as much as they are killing us).

Help us prove this word wrong by subscribing or making a donation.

We need around 350 subscribers per issue to stay solvent. While 350
subscribers doesn’t seem impossible, getting people to subscribe has
been difficult. We have less than 100 right now.

If for whatever reason you don’t want to subscribe to Chain, then please
subscribe to some other journal. Our situation is not unique right now.
Basically the middle man heavy system of book distribution is no longer
working. And in this anti-independent publication era we need grassroots
organizing and cottage industries more than ever.

To my knowledge, Elliza McGrand hasn't announced the publication of the

think I'd be amiss in directing the List's attention to it.

Okay, so I'm in it. But so are listmembers Henry Gould, Matthias Regan,

henceforth when i write "George Bowering" it means Michael Ondaatje, except
on thursdays before noon when it means George Stanley, or sundays between 3
and 5 p.m. when it means Fiona Sharp. When i mention the book _Bowering's
B.C._ I will actually be referring to _The Decline & Fall of the Roman
Empire_. If I allude to Gb's poetry collection, _Kerrisdale Elegies_ , what
will be intended will be _Watt_ , by Samuel Beckett. Should I write
"Georege Bowering's navel has lint in it," I will really be saying "William
Butler Yeats was a dab hand at badminton." The expression "Bowering picked
absent-mindedly at his nostril-hairs" should be taken as saying "Laurence
Olivier never acted better in movies than when he was with Michael Caine."
If I wish to tell the List, "Evelyn Waugh scarcely improved with age" I
think I shall say, "George Bowering opens his boiled egg at the wide end."
Oh, and "Bowering cracks his knuckles during sex" will mean "Bowering is
incorrigible ask his wife."   David I

Geroge Bowering knows he says which end is up.  Others arent so sure. That
he knows that. Its late at night, here amid the puffy sea-clouds and the
thudding apple orchards, but isnt me memory correct that Swift has a
conflict between Big endians and Little  endians? Or did I dream that up
sometime & nw its like a true memory?  Anyway, if Goerge is a Big Endian
then his wife, Angela, is likely a Little Endian, because married couples
polarize to simplify the world. George, tell us about reading with Robin
Blaser on Salt Spring Island, you cant have ben as bizarre as he says you
were. (just kidding). (just planting the seed of dfoubt,Its my job, like
Cato's job with Peter Sellers.

Subject:      I toddled to a reading

I caught the tail end of a 2-day Irish poetry visit at Brown Univ. -
Dublin poets Billy Mills & Catherine Walsh read.  2 fine writers -
in different ways writing a "social" poetry - not that they recycle
"public" issues or themes, either directly or indirectly - but that
rather than telling personal stories, they find a meditative/dramatic
language of social perception - I admired their independence -
the poems seem "finished" rather than over-reaching - Walsh a
playful, deadpan writer - intersperses overheard street
talk with funny elementary-school how-I-construct-this elements -
Mills I appreciated for clarity of perception - there is something
to be said for "integrity" or the "integral" aspect to a poem -
I don't want to say unity - but the integration of thought, visual
& aural perception, emotion, & language-rhythm is something to
aim for - clear visual imagery (not obvious, but clear) is analogous
to overall "harmony", the sense of completeness - not necessary,
perhaps, but it helps - in the case of Mills, it's clear imagery
in part because one of his themes is ongoing local mundane beauty &
hidden ongoingness -

they have their own cottage industry over there, unfortunately
I don't have the info here on how to obtain their publications
but maybe when Randolph Healy gets back to the emerald, he
can re-post some of that ? -   Henry Gould

Sorry, George is a declared _Little_Endian, therefore his wife is likely a
_Big_Endian.

I might also have been clearer on this matter of domesticity and
polarization. When a friend the other day said "My wife was nervous about
the people camped beside us at these remote hot springs in eastern Oregon,
so I didn't get to be," I understood a lot about marriage (& not before
time). Facing outward, this polarization of roles makes for strength, for
more points-of-view are possible, the landscape is more fully surveyed.
Face-to-face, however, and as we know, it can cause trouble. I took the
Bowerings as example due to their 35 years of marriage, & because Listlings
revere GB, but I meant no harm in doing so, and might just as well have
taken myself and Cecelia as instance. Or, literally, my father &
stepmother, who in their later years had, according to my sister, a number
of disputes centering on the correct end at which to open a boiled egg.

I dont know what any of this has to do with poetics. It was very late at
night and my sleeping pill was speaking (witness the spellings). When I
read the results this morning (surprised to find the message) I was only
relieved it wasnt more irrelevant. But would someone respond re Big Endians
vs. Little Endians--_is_ that Swift?  David I

Big-Endian and Little-Endian do go back to Gulliver's Travels; but
they are now---no kidding!---the standard technical terms for two ways
of ordering bytes within a word of computer memory.  See that famous

A late note on the interview thread: Steve McCaffery has something to say
on that subject (and many others) in an interview with Clint Burnham from
Witz 1.2.  I've posted it online at:

Unless it is a musical piece sounding its own tune, i'd vote for

>. George, tell us about reading with Robin
>Blaser on Salt Spring Island,

We read in a church (that seems to be the norm--did the same in another
Church on Vancouver Island a few weeks later) with the summer door open so
that the dog could walk in and out, and the crows could comment on the
norion of a serial poem. Her mainly read his latest section of the Great
Companions series, this one Dante. I heard him read from it a month later
in a roundhouse, where he read with Sharon Thesen. The Dante section, as
you likely know, is the third one, following the Pindar and Duncan
sections. But the Dante section is a whole book long! No one knows what the
form or mode is; it uses all kinds of language, discourse, etc. Ah but Salt
Spring Island. The evening before, we had dinner, and then breakfast in the
morning, with Phyllis Webb, at the home of poet Brian Brett/ well, home! It
is a beautiful huge long house full of curios and food, set in the best
garden I have seen, and this garden becomes a farm greadually, and there
were baby peacocks and peahens (when they are babies how do you tell?) on
the lawn, being pursued by a cat, but the peahen then pursues the cat, who
runs under the horse. And so on. Blaser, of course, was enthralled.

Of course it was.

And I have a neat experience. Once my girlfriend Joan (David B. will
remember her) and I were having an argument about which end of the boiled
egg to open. We took it, as we did most disputes, to my father Ewart for
his judgement. He said nothing but placed his boiled egg on its side in a
little bown, cut it down the middle, and ate out of both halves.

This works for soft-boiled, too, with a little preparation. Carve, as we
have, a shallow depression at each place setting, place egg in same, cut,
and lick it out! No mess, and no dished to clean.

Subject:      Re: Ass backwards--notes from the pointy-end

Fer what its worth. The pointy end is where the innoculation of chicken
eggs are done. The reason is simple, innoculants must be injected between
the membrane and the shell and, if the egg is stood pointy-side up the
airpocket forces the membrane to lie on the surface of the albumen and
leaves a space to make the injection via automated equipment (I gather
these are eggs used for research, I can't imagine innoculating table-ready
eggs). My source is first-hand from my Uncle Joe who invented the process
for Cutter Laboratories back in the 30's. Saved them mllions. Joe got
nothing. He also discovered a cure for cancer I believe. But was
light-years ahead of his time. He died last year at the age of 88.

also, due to a demented tech support person i-won't-say-where, all the
data
on my hard drive was deleted, some of which was backed-up-----but not
the
submissions for POTEPOETZINEFOUR, the women's writing issue, which
was promising to be a great issue---the writers who were to be included
in that
issue should resend their texts----thanks in advance for that----

POTEPOETZINEFIVE will be guest edited by alan sondheim
and
POTEPOETZINESIX will be guest edited by jim leftwich---
these will be sent in october----

please send all submissions for POTEPOETZINESEVEN, a
general issue, after mid-october, when these problems have
been solved and issues 4, 5, and 6 have been sent out----

also, during that mass deleting, my entire electronic address book
vanished---
i have about 75% of the ZINE's subscribers addresses in hard copy, but
the
latest ones, from people who subscribed after, say, july first, may not
be included---
if those people can resend their email addresses, i'd appreciate it----
i will be reentering the list in the next week into the netscape
communicator
4.0's address book over the next two weeks---

thanks so much for your indulgence of bandwidth for this message-----
i hope that in the future my computer situation will run more smoothly
and look forward to publishing more poetry electronically---

also---
in hard copy through potes & poets press, four books are being published

at this moment---they will be available solely through small press
distribution,
whose address is 1371 seventh st, berkeley ca, 94710---tel. for orders--

1-800-869-7553---

the four are----

I don't think there are Seattle area folks on the list who don't already
receive Subtext e-mail, though I could be wrong, but

Anyway, for the record, (& for any of you who have already made your travel
plans) the October 16th reading previously announced as Ezra Mark and Jeff
Derksen has been been changed to Ezra Mark & Tom Raworth.  Derksen was
unable to come out to the West Coast at that time, but we will reschedule a
reading by him for a later date.

Thanks to the folks at the Kootenay School of Writing for fortuitously
scheduling a reading by Tom Raworth for that weekend & of course to Raworth
for being flexible in his travel arrangements.

&, hey, does anyone have a working URL for a KSW Web site?  The one at
wimsey doesn't seem to work.

Bests,

Herb

Small Press Traffic was founded in 1974 by a group of writers and
individuals who saw the need for an outlet for new and experimental writers
and small press publications. From being primarily a bookstore, Small Press
Traffic has evolved into a presenting organization sponsoring writing
workshops and readings throughout the year, with special attention to
emerging writers. Small Press Traffic's new home at New College will also
house SPT's resource center and literary archive, scheduled to open this
Fall.

Content-Type: text/plain

Dear List:

(Please excuse/let me now if this is a redundant request or topic)

Recently someone asked for help in locating B. Mayers writing
experiments.  I similarly would like some help-- I started a new writing
workshop-- 1/3 time reading poems I bring to class (contemporary
poets),2/3 time writing in-class-- and was wondering if everyone could
send their favorite writing experiment/exercise to the list-- or make
one up-- or send many ideas.  And if it has an accompaning "model" poem,
please tell me where I could find it.

I have collected alot of these over time, with multiple and endless
variations, and it would be great to get some fresh ideas.  I will post
one of my faves latter...

Thanks a bunch--

HOa

in case you're not aware of the volume, you might wish to look at the
book that collected many & varied exercises (and discussions of same)
from a range of American poets -- I don't recall the title, but the
volume was published just a few years ago.  Co-edited by poets Chase
Twitchell & one other.  (It was mentioned on Poetics some time ago.)

The other editor is Robin Behn and the title is The Practice of Poetry.
Some of the experiments are okay but the Twitchell/Behn compilation
doesn't touch the Mayer/Bernstein list.

well, not to stifle any list activity that this might
provoke=97I'd certainly be interested to talk abt.
procedure with you folks=97but there's a good list @:

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/documents/experiments.html
(EPC-authors-Bernstein-poetry "experiments")

  =97a compilation of stuff that includes at least some
(dunno how much) of the B. Mayer suggestions...

I'd also suggest making yr kids buy Chain #4, which
is the (whatever it's called) "procedures" (?) issue, &
shld be very useful in both opening discussion &
"inspiring young minds". it's certainly something I'd
do if I were teaching right now. the useful thing in this
context is that many of the wrtrs have appended a brief
note on procedure attached, including those by Jackson
Mac Low, Dodie Bellamy & Joel Felix, Jeremy Caplan,
Tina Darragh, Dan Featherston... the list goes on but I
won't. & it's a good chance to support the 'zine, too
(&, for that matter, a good chance to mention the,
"ahem", economics of contemporary poetry...)

I'll share one procedure that I've used, though it's
certainly nothing new: ex-listee Matthias Regan &
I were=97that is, until he lost 'is email, moving to SF
'n all=97doing collaborative work in which we'd take

second lifted from the "autobiographical" interview
with Charles Bernstein in the most recent Boundary 2
(I love #s)=97& send it to him as is. then he'd perform a
series of free transformations & interpolations, adding
lines, substituting or moving words, re-lineating the text,
& so forth=97& then send it to me for similar "treatment".
when I say "free", more precisely what I mean is that
transformations cld be of any nature=97i.e., phonetic,
graphical, conceptual etc.=97& there was no limit to their
# or severity, or the amount of text he cld add/subtract.
so, not "free", really=97let's just say that this isn't work
that used "generative constraints" or even firm rules. the
exercise ended when we agreed that the poem was
"finished", i.e., when both of us were satisfied with it=97
though, in truth, the game is much more process- than
product-oriented, &, while I like the work that came out
of it, much of its excitement for me was its agonistic
character. I've wondered what it wld be like to have
this kind of negotiation with someone I don't know

I think this may be well known and understood but for what...In group
exercises I've always favored those that began with the question, "What
resources do the participants actually bring to the project? What different
levels of expertise in various experience areas do we have in the room?"

By this I do not mean writing experience, but various techne from the
student's lives that might be brought into an exercise. From that
information, both collective and individual exercises may be developed
which play upon various ways of having students bring those experiences
into the project. When that knowledge pool is known (say needleworking,
aviation mechanics, linebackers (always those), the one who just buried
their father, and so forth) then interesting exercises may be devised by
orchestrating those talents rather than starting from the position that the
exercise (individualized and technical) must come first and the
talent/experiences realized and revealed secondarily through the product.
(needleworkers, incidently, seem to be terrific at meter)

a small example:

an avid reader of comic books was assigned the task of writing an imaginary
train wreck. Predictably the result resembled several pages of wheels,
sprockets, screetches, frozen tableau, thought baloons. Good imagery
(powerful, clipped, visual), atrocious construction and a Toys R' Us
collection of odds and ends. The piece was next given to a carpenter (who
recently changed specialties from house building to cabinet making) with
the instruction to treat the first material as if he had just gone to the
lumber yard for materials. Using mainly those materials and some
connectives and prepositions and so forth - construct the cabinetry  and
appliances for a kitchen sink. I don't have the piece anymore but I do
recall the line "bubbling foam shot from her throat".

much interest in reading about your collaborative process / thanks / two
things as well in your post interest me:

the idea of collaboration (especially using email) with someone you
"don't know so well" / this past year i worked with a friend in
Vancouver (carl peters, also a list-member) on a collaborative
back-and-forth e-essay on Keats and Wordsworth (must admit it was mostly
carl's enthusiasm that carried the piece) which was something very new
for me / email affords that opportunity for rapid transfer and -lation
that may not work so well via snail-correspondence / anyway, the only
way i know carl is through email (met very briefly at the Blaser
conference a couple summers back), and i'm sure others on the list have
similar e-friendships that offer interesting opportunities for this kind
of quasi-distant collaboration

also, the "agonistic" nature of the collaborative process, which of late
i've considered applicable to the writing process in general: roughly,
the coil-recoil of "agonistic" and "antagonistic" forces played out in
dramatic (?) fashion in the construction of a work / did a little
research a while back on the early greek meanings of "agon" but haven't
the notes handy / maybe someone else...?

as a twentieth century artform. This work situates artists' books within
the context of mainstream developments in the visual arts from Russian
Futurism and Surrealism to Fluxus, Conceptual Art, to Postmodernism. Topics
include the discussion of the poetics of the book, the book as a metaphor,
the conceptual space of the book, and books as narrative and non-narrative
sequences. The book provides a foundation for future work in the history
and critical interpretation of artists' books as well as offering a
structure for teaching artists' books to practitioners, collectors and

This is a simple writing experiment appropriate for any writing class,
from primary grades through senior citizen.  All you need is a pencil,
a sheet of paper, a pair of pliers, a toothpick, an old transistor
radio, and a group of enthusiastic would-be writers.

First, place the paper and writing implement (i.e. the pencil) on a
solid, flat surface.  Take the pliers & smash or pry off the plastic
frame of the radio (yard sale radios are cheap and work fine).  Use the
toothpick and pliers to create a nifty brain-antennae by attaching to
handy forehead area of the writer.  Pull out the transistor section
of the radio and attach as best you can to the toothpick.  After making
sure the batteries are still functional, turn on the radio.  Set
volume to medium - not too loud. Now - using the pencil and paper,
write down whatever comes through.  You can switch channels, adjust
the volume, whatever helps you in the writing process.

Once you have mastered this nifty experimental technique, you can
teach it to others.  Flairie McDougal, of the Writelit Project in
East Lansing, MI, has produced an entire anthology of brain transistor
poetry, titled HEAD SWITCH - POETRY FROM FOUR HUNDRED FOREHEADS, which
will be available soon from Univ. of Left Overbie Press.  Reserve
your head trips now - only $24.95 pre-ordered.  Special to list
members.

& try it yourself!  It works!  Try AM 630 in Detroit - especially good
for inspiration!  (Jeannie Klappert heard the voice of Di there!)

I'd like to point everyone in the direction of a very useful discussion
between David Shapiro and Joseph Lease about the role of the "I" in poetry
that appeared in the new issue of the Mark Prejsnar edited newsletter
Misc. Proj. Mark's lurking around the list here somewhere, and I'd
encourage you to contact him about the newsletter. There's been intriguing
poetry and critical writing in each issue, but the Lease and Shapiro
exchange (originally an e-mail discussion, I take it) seems particularly
timely and useful.

This just in :  NEW VIRUS WARNING

If you see a message on the boards with a subject line of "Badtimes,"
delete it immediately WITHOUT reading it.  This is the most dangerous
virus yet.

It will re-write your hard drive.  Not only that, but it will scramble
any disks that are even close to your computer (20' range at 72
farenheit).  It will recalibrate your refrigerator's coolness setting
so all your ice cream melts and milk curdles .  It will demagnetize
the strips on all your credit cards, reprogram your ATM access code,
screw up the tracking on your VCR and use subspace field harmonics to
scratch any CDs you try to play.

It will give your ex-boy/girlfriend your new phone number. It will
program your phone autodial to call only your mother's number.

It will mix antifreeze into your fish tank. It will drink all your
beer and leave its dirty socks on the coffee table when there's
company coming over.

It will hide your car keys when you are late for work and interfere
with your car radio so that you hear 1940's hits and static while
stuck in traffic.

"Badtimes" will make you fall in love with a hardened pedophile.  It
will give you nightmares about circus midgets.  It will replace your
shampoo with Nair and your Nair with Rogaine, all while dating your
current boy/girlfriend behind your back and billing their hotel
rendezvous to your Visa card.

It will seduce your grandmother.  It does not matter if she is dead,
such is the power of "Badtimes", it reaches out beyond the grave to
sully those things we hold most dear.

It will rewrite your back-up files, changing all your active verbs to
passive tense and incorporating undetectable misspellings which
grossly change the interpretation of key sentences.

"Badtimes" will give you Dutch Elm disease. It will leave the toilet
seat up and leave the hairdryer plugged in dangerously close to a full
bathtub. It will wantonly remove the forbidden tags from your
mattresses and pillows, and refill your skim milk with whole. It is
insidious and subtle. It is dangerous and terrifying to behold. It is
also a rather interesting shade of mauve.

These are just a few signs. Be very, very afraid. PLEASE FORWARD THIS
MESSAGE TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!!

I do not feel like commenting on Ted Hughes's poem for Di-- I have nto
read it (although that never stopped a cultural critic/anxious poet), but
I would like to say a few meandering words about a mass media poem now
inscribed in the domains on "global popular culture" (namely, our
collective whitmanic heads):  "Candle in the Wind."  Now I realize that
trope of fugitive delicacy is not gong to win any vanguard-metaphor
awards, but I must admit that the funereal combinatio n of that passage
from Corinthians on caritas, the Elton John canonization-of-a-goddess
lyric, and the scathing and oblique funeral oration were quite moving to
me.  I would invoke some term like 'ecclesiastical sublime' to describe
it, but here my lapsed-catholic childhood and array of car accident deaths
would enter in and I do not want to bore you with personal specifics.  But
I must say that, in hearing Elton John translate the 1973 version of
his/Bernie  Taupin's lyric for Marily Monroe into a song for "England's
rose" whose face is written in the stars and whose feet "forver trod on
England's greenest hills," I was amazed how the Monroe-subtext got
laundered out in almost all respects. The whole critique of predatory
media hounding MM to death, gazing at her naked dead body, feastin on her
pain and so on (as well as her own complicity in that apparatus of
celebrity glamor-mongering) was completely sublimated into a hymn to a
people's princess, a goddess of immortal beauty, a fugitive spirit passing
through the spendid machinery of god, church, and UK nationhood.  Now I
take my neo-platonism wherever I can find it, from Smokey Robinson to Bleu
Velvet, but I must admit that the previous lyric of ye old Elton/Bernie
(unless I filter it in as some kind of hidden subtext) had much more punch
to it, pathos with a kind of rage and contempt (which Elton later had to
displace on to Madonna, who ca handle it).  So that poem goes into the
public domain, and i am glad for it much more than for any work by Ted
Hughes I must admit, but I just wonder about well say the complicity of
such banal metaphors and soporific sublimity in creating a mood that made,
say, Christopher Hitchens "puke all week" as he watched the rescue of the
House of Windsor by (ironically) the House of Spencer (Elton John playing
Edmund Spencer for the Fairie Queen of our aristocratic nostalgia to
worship those of breeding "to beauty bred").
While I am going on a bit long about self-translatoin/translation, I have
a brief question for David Raphael Israel translating Han Shan's "Cold
Moutain" poems. I have read and took to my language-ridden heart the gary
Snyder "Cold Mountain" poems in his translatoin (is it from around 1965?
Kerouach has Japhy Rhyder (GS) working on them in "Dharma Bums which ends
up a la Han Shan "sitting" in the mountains of Desolation Peak Washington
or some such).  Snyder's translations had a gnarled, raunchy, collquial,
idiomatic twist to each phrase. I find your version a bit archaic in
diction, with all kinds of Augustan inversions and word choices. What is
the gain in such a translatoin by you?  Are you pushing Han Shan towards a
kind of formality of diction, a kind of high style phrasing?  A student of
mine, Steve Bradbury, was long working on Ho Chimin's poems, and wanted to
bring back some of the formality/wit he felt American translators were
losing in their moves from Chinese language into a quasi-Whitmanic free
verse (see the issue of boundary 2 with those devious Bernstein/Mayer
language experiments in it and the self-translation of Charles Bernstein
by Charles Berstein into the "interview genre of selfhood" a la Paris
Review).
I have already taken too much of your computer space.  Regards from the
enclaves of bad and devious prose, Rob Wilson

rob, i'm happy you've seen fit to mention ej's rerendering of "candle in
the wind"... personally, i too was moved, muchly, by blair/john/and the
earl... i mean, moved beyond my sense of being exploited, or of
exploitation taking place, or of sheer bombastic global media event, or of
some presumed tragic realization of a monarchy in the throes... in fact,
and though as you know i generally like hitchens, i found the moment
completely absorbing, felt not a whit like puking... in fact i was all
welled-up!... and in fact i prefer john's new version to the old!---i
prefer it being about di's death than about mm's, even w/o the gay subtext
that i assume forms part of the positive response to this tune...

anyway, i found mself thinking about why our various publics, me too, seem
to need this oportunity to grieve---just assuming for a split-second that
this desire hasn't exactly been foisted onto us... i mean, publics such as
the u.s., which, it seems, do so little in the way of mourning, have in so
many cases converted funerals and death and such like into yet another
exercise in fast-food (yeah) convenience (monty python once riffed on this,
as i recall)... i'm not sure the answer is to be found in global theater,
either... i think there may be a very real need---dare i say human-societal
need?---to come to terms with the significance of what many of my students
call 'passing'...

at the grocery check-out line last saturday eve, kass and i chatted with
the cashier, who told us she'd been watching "too much funeral"... and then
she paused, saying

ain't it weird, though?

be interested in what other folks think, esp. you folks on that side of the
atlantic...

best,

joe

1.   rob wilson: "I do not feel like commenting on Ted Hughes's poem for

 So, here it is:

Mankind is many rivers
That only want to run.
Holy Tragedy and Loss
Make the many One.

Mankind is a Holy, crowned
Mother and her Son.
For worship, for mourning:
God is here, is gone.

Love is broken on the Cross.
The Flower on the Gun.

2."I must admit that the previous lyric of ye old Elton/Bernie

Still, Elton John is an exemplary modernist or pomod/ in recycling an
earlier song and setting up the Marilyn/Diana equation thanks to the ghost
of the earlier text.

Actually I tried it - worked wonderfully. All things nicht & noxious now
eliminated from my life. Small side-effect successfully managed by
tethering milk and ice-cream at bottom of pond and tying other end to
nearby chaise lounge. Computer residue sent to Museum of Modern Art for
next installation. Pedophile paradox negotiated by falling for midget
pedophile. She found my nightmares so arousing that she has successfully
realligned her predeliction to target Epstein-Barr comic illustrators. As
soon as I finish my "Be An Artist In Your Own Home Guaranteed"
correspondence course we plan to be married.

This just in :  NEW VIRUS WARNING

If you see a message on the boards with a subject line of "Badtimes,"
delete it immediately WITHOUT reading it.  This is the most dangerous
virus yet.

It will re-write your hard drive.  Not only that, but it will scramble
any disks that are even close to your computer (20' range at 72
farenheit).  It will recalibrate your refrigerator's coolness setting
so all your ice cream melts and milk curdles .  It will demagnetize
the strips on all your credit cards, reprogram your ATM access code,
screw up the tracking on your VCR and use subspace field harmonics to
scratch any CDs you try to play.

It will give your ex-boy/girlfriend your new phone number. It will
program your phone autodial to call only your mother's number.

It will mix antifreeze into your fish tank. It will drink all your
beer and leave its dirty socks on the coffee table when there's
company coming over.

It will hide your car keys when you are late for work and interfere
with your car radio so that you hear 1940's hits and static while
stuck in traffic.

"Badtimes" will make you fall in love with a hardened pedophile.  It
will give you nightmares about circus midgets.  It will replace your
shampoo with Nair and your Nair with Rogaine, all while dating your
current boy/girlfriend behind your back and billing their hotel
rendezvous to your Visa card.

It will seduce your grandmother.  It does not matter if she is dead,
such is the power of "Badtimes", it reaches out beyond the grave to
sully those things we hold most dear.

It will rewrite your back-up files, changing all your active verbs to
passive tense and incorporating undetectable misspellings which
grossly change the interpretation of key sentences.

"Badtimes" will give you Dutch Elm disease. It will leave the toilet
seat up and leave the hairdryer plugged in dangerously close to a full
bathtub. It will wantonly remove the forbidden tags from your
mattresses and pillows, and refill your skim milk with whole. It is
insidious and subtle. It is dangerous and terrifying to behold. It is
also a rather interesting shade of mauve.

These are just a few signs. Be very, very afraid. PLEASE FORWARD THIS
MESSAGE TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!!

Still, Elton John is an exemplary modernist or pomod/ in recycling an
earlier song and setting up the Marilyn/Diana equation thanks to the ghost
of the earlier text.

He does not qualify as bricoleur, though,  since he's essentially recycling his own prior fabrications - junk engineering I'd say.

my god.  this hughes poem is
W R E T C H E D!!!!

please, don't put something like that up without a "Could Be Dangerous To Your
Health" warning timothy!  but thanks for putting it up anyway.

re diana spencer's death, it has hit me horribly, i think because we are the
same age, and i (along with many women i know) have gone through much of what
she has in certain ways, so there is empathy along female lines (rejection,
elation, work/children, betrayal, public betrayal, revenge, etc).  we have all
been discussing alot.  it is hard to talk about past a certain level, sort of
liek the anita hill/clarence thomas and the oj thing.  one gets to a level of
pain that is very silencing.  her brother's funeral oration, in that it spoke
the unspeakable, gave voice to so many strands of what was happening in a raw,
honest kind of way, was extraordinary.  i wept watching, and i don't often weep.

i work in hospice, and it has been a very very bad week (lost five patients
this week, one very close, one fairly close) and so i speak from position of
one immersed in funerals/death.  but it is, from my perspective, rare for anyone
to be so blazingly honest, and strong about confronting tasks for future and
their roots in past.  all too often, the gilding comes out.

as for saving house of windsor, i think the queen has come out of this looking
pathetically (almost) awful, charles even worse, and so i wouldn't really say
the house of windsor was saved by it all.  the children were always fetching,
photogenic, and charming, and have continued to be so.  the only difference
is that it is clear, now, that they are the future, not prince charles.

my biggest dilemna
has been the tabloids.  i always read them in grocery store lines, and now
i feel too uncomfortable to do that.  on the one hand, it is good to see
celebs punctured -- frank gifford, for example, after the Moral Majority
stance he seemed to assume, as well as kathy lee's stunning openness and
pain as betrayed wife have brought the issue out to the public as nothing
else has in a long time.  but on the other, the kind of stalking princess
diana suffered was hideous.  david bromiges' post was, as always, brilliant
other side.  i am now working out in my mind alot of thoughts about public
and private life, what shoudl be what...

Comments: To: rob wilson <rwilson@HAWAII.EDU>

Rob: I certainly agree with your comments on the sublimation process at work
in John's new version - it smacks of the kind of defensive
revision/repression Wordsworth performed in _The Prelude_ for instance and
which Yeats was known for as well. And, too, one can't fail to notice the
Blakean allusion in John's line about "England's green hills," equating
Diana with Christ himself! In the unwieldy effort to conflate these two
disparate icons, a certain necessary elision must take place I suppose. I
marvelled not only at how swiftly D's apotheosis took place, but also at
where it occured: at the intersection of royal tradition and pop
fetishization.

Appended is a poem re: the media event of Diana (rather than D. herself). I
happened to be studying ballads that day. Some of the quotes are from the
Norton Anthology, including its footnotes; some from _On Signs_, edited by
Marshall Blonsky, which contains a detailed critique of the royal wedding.

ELEGAIC PASTICHE

Narrative details might form
a ballad about a princess
or any handsome young woman
"who would fain lie down."
But to classify the subject
by meters, focussing on
a catastrophic moment,
would also signal the typical
betrayal and elevation
of a TV loneliness
as attested to by
the attendance of crowds
and the spectacle of roses
and signatures, which are all
we have really, when you come
down to it.
          Of a loveliness that daily
fed us nothing is certain
but the crisis of its aftermath.
It involves images of dearness,
replicated many times.
Kissing "the wounds that were so red."
"A species of deer distinguished"
by a supernal color
so that its gawky movements,
fabricated as they are,
give us a sense that an increase
in the amount of available light
is what lends consumerism its tragic tone,
the lieux de memoire of
the "lost participatory dimension."

"Of a loveliness that fed us nothing"/
"daily"
your line that says it all the royals now feeding on Blake and Jesus to
consecrate their own lineage once again
and we can only weap and applaud in the wings of westminister abbey
or more likely be cleaning the chimney sweep so that the Mercedes Benz
can dematerialize into drunken light at 120MPH
and we can clean up the fragments of a saint
who was no Dionysisus Crucified
and Elton John can suck melancholy from the rose of England
Di flipping over into Saint Theresa of the orphic tombs
and we should read htis whole media act "through a glass darkly"
puking into Vanity Fair with some cultural critiques for good measure

Maybe... it may be that he doesn't know the quote's source particularly but
has come to something in the public domain associatively... this has been a
good week for Elgar and Vaughan Williams. I don't think he is as
consciously a maker as Yeats and Wordsworth

Others than Christ will walk on the hills of the green and pleasant land...
the reference DOES suggest, I think, that through the intercession of Diana
- co-co-redemptress - we can build the new Jerusalem using only a small
donation and a bunch of flowers

I haven't heard this week of all weeks - referenda on Scottish and Welsh
Assemblies - anyone complain that the the princess of WALES is located by
EJ in England

The Ear Inn series in New York has moved to HERE, just around the corner
from the Ear, and will be continuing in October on Saturday afternoons. I
hope we will be able to get the full schedule posted before too long. HERE

         Welcome back Julu to your space and your home. Look.
                    There is nothing special here.
                                Laugh.
  Julu laughs at Jennifer who watches the arrival of her friend with
                            tearful eyes.
  You have a swollen belly, Jennifer, says, Julu, who is the little

Julu thinks, God this is really stupid. So what if we went into the Bre-
vard talker and had a fake discussion? What difference does it make - and
it's so simple to fake the real when the real's funneled through a sieve,
as if dyads ruled the world!

The song-book here is the fake-book and the real is the belly. Alan just
doesn't see himself anymore. Julu says, I know this for a fact, this self-
indulgent post - and she was right, everything he does is autobiography,
raking the coals of his past, listen if you still have the time and the
grace to see where the birth's come from, this arrival - or maybe the pre-
science of cyberspace, after all, quoting him _exactly_ from his Disorders
of the Real, that word again, that belly which he now knows is the belly:


"Alan Sondheim

"Alan Sondheim lives in another world, just like our own.
He could not tell one from the other.
He was sure they were joined at the horizon.
Alan Sondheim saw the world was his.
He'd say, 'Hi, world!'
He saw the world in a mirror, except for a corner,
a hinge. He couldn't move in that close.
There was always the mirror to contend with.
Alan Sondheim would listen to you speaking and would
listen to Alan Sondheim listening to you speaking.
Sometimes he would miss a sentence or two.
He would catch up when he stopped listening.
Alan Sondheim knew that the world was doubled.
He saw that it was halved. He had half of
everything but he could always skip a line.
He had half of everything but nothing puckered.
It puckered where everything was.
Alan Sondheim would watch it burst, but it would burst
in one world and not the other, not even fragments
would burst from one world to the other.
Alan Sondheim was not joined at the horizon.
He did not hear or see so well. He heard his own
heartbeat when he could make everything quiet. He
could make everything quiet and even his own death
quiet. He would see the stuffing of the world first
and then the world. Alan Sondheim would hardly hear
because of the stuffing of the world. He could hardly
see, either."

The Marginalization of Poetry

  If I were a poet
In this world of poor mutts
Of crazed historians                      [shd all be bold, italicized, centered
Pushing Safeway carts
Across parking lots
Where shoppers drive
With no sense of protocol
Where  le peuple thrust
Into the elevators
Before le peuple get out
Where the President's son
Bilked an electorate
Out of S & L millions

Who, scant years later, unpunished,
Ran himself for President,
If I were one touched with vision
In the older construation
Fetched into this present
Where  murders convenient
To powerful persons
Were always acts of "crazed
Loners,"  where wealth
Entrenched itself & its children
And pity was an armband
Easily discarded at day's end,
If I were one touched with fire

And were I not, why bother,
What I would occupy would be the center,
Having studied what's been done,
Take myself as measure,
Whoever any given morning
He might be,  this I,
And my poetry would be the best,
Ignored because of that,
Feared & reviled because of that,
That avant garde imperative
That blurts out truths,
discomforting, inprovable,
And everyone be marginal but me

creative, and all things in between). The Twentieth-Century Lit.
Conference now has a web site with all the necessary
info--http://www.louisville.edu/a-s/cml/xxconf/

The Conference has a history (well, I think so anyway) of receptiveness
to "alternative" poetics--at least in terms of papers (I don't have
anything to do with the selection of "creative" submissions), so do
consider coming.

Barnard New Poets Prize for 1998

Charles, et. al.
Have no quibble with the matter and recognize the Barnard Prize as a worthy
competition . Granted that the sponsor is gender based. Still I'm curious
as to what internal rationale continues to drive the maintenance of
submission venues based upon gender-biased entries. Does there yet exist an
exlusion of women as authors (as differentiated from, say, themes/forms of
poetry presumed to be of greater interest to women)? Has there been, in
recent years, identified exlcusions of woman from publication or
competition based solely upon the gender of the author?

Love Among the Internauts


Your day, my night, bracketed together, we
 displace time among us; your night, my day,
  sliding against lunch or midnight drinking
   away, so that the rhyme, distanced, is poor,
or say, I might, jacketed in weather, see
 misplaced rime, hung thus; poor sight, why lay,
  confiding hence, hunched over hindsight thinking,
    lure?

Your night, my day, shackled together, we
 yearn one another's speaking in dim time like shelves
  buried among us, lights blink in Fukuoka-York,
   or rather storms brew, too, runners all, photons
    down slots or fence of world, you are green light,
my way, and violet light in rainy weather will be
 burned across sleek lines, untimed like selves
  hurled among us. Take a right turn in Shi-New,
   or feathered arms carried you and me upon shoguns
    hot, hence the whence of unfurled world.

                                             Your day, my night

I have very sad news to report. Hannah Weiner has died. Word of her
unexpected death reached me late last night. Apparently she died of natural
causes in her apartment on East 12th street in Manhattan.  Hannah meant so
very much to me and I know to many other poets who were lucky enough to
have known her and her inspiring and courageous work, her enthusiastic
engagement with writing, her brilliant and acute (and often wickedly funny)
perspectives on poets and poetry, her incredible performances. While her
last few years weren’t easy, she continued to produce amazing writing,
pushing her own poetry and the possibilities for poetry into new zones of
perception.

Hannah would have turned 69 on November 4.

I include here a bibliography of her work that I compiled a few years ago.
It doesn’t include a forthcoming Roof book and perhaps a few other more
recent pieces. There is also a LINEbreak interview with Hannah available
via the EPC as well as a one hour radio show (with readings and an
interview), produced by Erneso Grosman, that is also up at the EPC.

thanks charles for this sad news. tho i never met her her work came to mean
a lot to me the moment i opened Spoke (thanks to your suggestion that i
look into her work). out of shyness, i had been stalling sending her a copy
of my essay on her, which she'd heard about and asked for last february.
i've still got the pink stationery letter from her in my "to do" pile right
by the computer.  now she's become the silent teacher she had been in
training for all these years, and i bet we'll continue to be surprised at
how she enters our lives.

This is truly a shock to the whole poetry community.
I will be posting a wonderful story written by Hannah
tomorrow morning or late this afternoon in tribute to
this wonderful exploratory poet. Hannah's was certainly
one of the most original contributions to American poetry
ever. Her work was like no one else's, and its ability
to combine the personal and linguistic experimentation
should serve as a beacon to all those who mistakenly
feel there is a split between self-expression and intellectual
pursuits.

i am puzzled at such a question even being asked.  it has been discussed over

erasure, whereby women's history, theory, literature are built up to a certain
basic level, then erased, so that energy is kidnapped by a continual process
of establishing, over and over, the basics.  thus, we are not only not allowed
to get beyond basics, but have to keep proving them over nad over and over
because they keep getting wiped out.

if this really is a serious question, go to a library and do a literature

Almost all literary prizes are exclusionary, whether of older poets,
younger poets, poets with no books, poets with only one book, poets
translating their own work from kikchikel, etc. And there's no reason for a
woman's college (is Barnard still technically all-female?) not to offer a
prize for women poets. But you and Maria seem to be answering the supposed
hidden agenda of Red Slider's question. I don't think that there are any
poetry contests that exclude women. Maybe Robert Bly could get one going.

Barnard is still technically all-female. Columbia College (NY - to
distinguish it from the other Columbia Colleges, at least one of which
publishes a pretty good poetry magazine, is it Illinois?) (which stopped
being technically all-male not much more than a decade ago) sends its
young males and females over to Barnard to take classes, and Barnard sends
its females over to Columbia. Each school has certain required classes
that students from the other may not take, and this mild protectionism
(allegedly) preserves the separate identities of the two schools, though
Barnard students seem to value the separation more. I'm interested in the
brusque appearance of the free trade rhetoric in response to the
announcement. I mean, why the hell not have a gender-restricted prize? I'd
bring in some heavy large-cap rhetoric of my own; I say, bring on the
Red Slider Award! I might even break my NO READING FEE rule to be
considered..

Anyway, to give up being flip for one second -- it's great that Lyn
Hejinian is judging the prize. Terrific, even.

On a totally unrelated note, I'm reading with Bob Rosenthal at the Zinc
Bar (formerly the Biblios Cafe reading series) this Sunday at 7 or so. The
Zinc Bar is located in Manhattan at 90 West Houston Street, which is on
the corner of LaGuardia and West Houston. LaGuardia is the Noho sibling of
W. Broadway. Bob Rosenthal is the author of many books, including
"Cleaning Up New York", a true account of his days as a housecleaner in
Manhattan. I'm the author of two chapbooks of poetry, and I'll be reading
at least one poem that you can't find at

ostriker's book _stealing the language_ is also  quite good on the
subject; she starts w/ bradstreet and ends w/--rich, i think...thus
indicating the long history of gender and poetics in Am.

I didn't know Hannah Weiner, & I hesitate to post for that
reason, not wanting my note to stand next to what those of
you may have to say who were her friends.

but her work has become very important to me, & to that
extent I feel a loss here as well.

I don't really feel like saying anything else. I'm not sure I
can justify or explain why I feel quite the way I do in this
case, & I'm not going to try. better to reflect on the good
she's done, & the priviledge of having read her work.

I spent the morning working on this. maybe it's a mistake
to post it, I don't know. take it in the spirit it's meant.

The posts from Charles Bernstein, Ron Silliman, Maria Damon and Douglas
Messerli together speak volumes--from the starkness of Ron's announcement
to the informative currency of Charles', to the keen insight of Douglas's
observation that in her one found the personal and the linguistically
challenging all of a piece...and to the poignancy of Maria's unanswered
letter. It is sad to look for the last time, even sadder not to have done
so. I extend my sympathies to Charles, who was I know close to Hannah for
many years. And I can certainly overlap with Maria's feelings, for Hannah
was a person I took to immediately & was looking forward to seeing when in
New York next month--but with whom I did not get around to corresponding.

At least, we have her work (and more I hope will now be made available),
and Douglas (one of her publishers--courageous publishers, one has to add,

Mark, you are correct if you are underscoring the absence of a hidden
agenda in my question. Naive perhaps. Hidden subtexts no. I specifically
excluded concerns regarding poetics formulae from my inquiry. I don't need
a library to inform me that forms and projects which, in general, are more
likely to be approached and adrotly and sucessfully by women have a long
and continuing history of supression and confiscation by dominant paradigms
(to paraphrase - erased in the cradle). I need only read the poetry. I
therefore constrained my question to matters of venue exclusion. That is
what I wished to know about. Maria's simple 'yes' was more informative,
actually, than Eliza's rather grand sweep (and I do wonder if I would have
received the same tone had I been a new woman poet posing the same
question). Anyway her citations are noted.

As to the matter of gender (or other forms of) exclusionary rules, I do
have doubts that the continuation of a project to advance the poetics of it
is benefited by author gender-typing. If it is the poetics and their
advancement that is at issue, then I ask, could there not be a male author
who might contribute an important advance to that side of things? If so,
rules examining the genitalia of authors rather than the contributions of
the works would seem inimical to that goal.

My own agenda, not at all hidden, is whether the general response to
submission-glut has more to do with driving exclusions than some intrinsic
canon required for the advancement of the project. I generally argue
against such extra-poetic rules as a means of dealing with that
increasingly serious problem and in favor of discovering other
ways/processes by which effective triage may be addressed. Apparently,
Maria and Eliza believe the substantive issues lie elsewhere, for which the
physical attributes of the author are relevant. I have no quarrel with that
nor with the Barnard prize exclusion. But I make no appology for asking the
question, regardless of who or may not believe it was (should have been)
asked. As a poet, man or woman, good or bad, that's just part of my job.

Almost all literary prizes are exclusionary, whether of older poets,
younger poets, poets with no books, poets with only one book, poets
translating their own work from kikchikel, etc. And there's no reason for a
woman's college (is Barnard still technically all-female?) not to offer a
prize for women poets. But you and Maria seem to be answering the supposed
hidden agenda of Red Slider's question. I don't think that there are any
poetry contests that exclude women. Maybe Robert Bly could get one going.

One of the posts David refers to is mine, but I didn't post it to this
list, rather to a local+Bromige list. So I'll repeat it here. It was
actually a note sent to a local weekly arts/culture paper, which has often
been friendly to various poetry interests here in Tucson, and some of the
way in which I construct is specific to the general audience of this paper.
I had earlier organized, for this paper, a memorial to Ginsberg. This is
what I sent them today, and it is certainly indebted to Charles Bernstein,
who I quote:

_________________________

Hannah Weiner
(1928-1997)

This year has been one of losing writers -- Allen Ginsberg, William
Burroughs, Alan Harrington, and more.
I think it's important to note that some great losses don't involve the
most famous names. In any generation, many writers who do not become well
known may be remembered decades or centuries later as the most interesting
of their time. I tend to believe that for every Emily Dickinson recovered
into our collective memory, there are probably several very fine writers
who are not found.

One of the most important writers of our time, in my opinion, although not
one of the most famous, has just died -- word reached me this morning that
Hannah Weiner was found in her apartment, on East 12th Street in Manhattan,
dead of natural causes. she would have been 69 years old on November 4. As
a fellow poet, Charles Bernstein, wrote in a note, "Hannah meant so very
much to me and I know to many other poets who were lucky enough to have
known her and her inspiring and courageous work, her enthusiastic
engagement with writing, her brilliant and acute (and often wickedly funny)
perspectives on poets and poetry, her incredible performances. While her
last few years weren't easy, she continued to produce amazing writing,
pushing her own poetry and the possibilities for poetry into new zones of
perception."

Hannah wrote to me a few months ago, on a postcard with a photograph of a
very young Bob Dylan, that New York was getting more difficult, wondering
what it was like to live in Arizona, whether she should move here. I hadn't
answered all of those questions yet, thinking there was a world of time.

Hannah saw words everywhere. She and her particular vision are missed --
immediately . . . and always.

Anyone who is interested might want to check out Mark DuCharme's brillaint
discussion of Hannah Weiner in the latest issue of *6ix* magazine.  Among
other things, he reads her psychic ability as a kind of "trope" for the way
in which "all writing is in some sense *perceived*, stolen, appropriated."
 He ends the essay by arguing that her "neutralization of the distinction
between public and private experience -- between ordinary language/ordinary
consciousness, and the poetic, is coterminous with her desire to neutralize
the distinction between poetry and . . . exterior life."  Such a utopian
possibility is enormously appealing -- at least for me.

Also, Weiner's poem "Silent History" in *Chain 4* is yet another persuasive
reason to check out that magazine.

She was Spokeless in the unacknowledged world of Big Wheels.

I was going to say that a contest based on examining the genitalia of
authors might be, depending upon the personnel, more pleasant than the
traditional contest. But I thought better of it. Still, what would be the
criteria? Would there be numerical scores, as in diving or skating? Would
there still be entry fees?

I think there are two issues here. 1: yes there is a history and remedy
and support are appropriate, but 2: I would like to know more about women's
writing and writers without the polemics - one of my sources of information
(not being academically affiliated and out in the country with few 'literary'
aware acquaintances) is seeing the names of prize winners announced.  I do
admit to not reading announcements of prizes for specifically womens' contests
because of my 'fear of polemics' but I suspect I am not the only one.

I think you make the case in point (skipping the problem of monitoring the
personnel office). This discussion has not been about the criteria for
winning, only criteria for entry. And the question remains, what is needed
for criteria for entry beyond the description of what the contest operators
wish to elucidate in the poetics of it? If, by Eliza's own suppositions,
women only contests must persist because of the need to advance poetic
investigations on matters generally (and, admittedly, most pursued) by
women. If that's it, then why not simply make that the criteria for the
entry - not the entrant - no matter who may advance that enterprise? If
divers feel that they have been given short shrift and that the paradigms
of poetry have been built around 'too much splash at the end of the poem'
then by all means a Constest call for 'splashless poetry'. If they want to
decide the winner by number cards, fine. But, if they say only people who
swim may enter - they may be draining their own tub. The world's first
zero-splash poem may just have been done by a kid with cerebral palsy who
has had to spend his life poolside - carefully watching the construction of
a dive.

I mean if Bly and Mailer want to run a best jock-itch scratching
poem-powder contest - hey scratch away. I know a couple of woman poets who
could problably bust the straps on most of the entrants.

'Multiplicity of Form' has some nice edges that may be exciting and worth
exploration. But it's never going to happen as long as the constructor of
the form is mistaken for the form of the construction. no?

It's a sad day when a guy can't attempt a joke in bad taste without having
a serious inference drawn. For the record, I think the gal or guy with the
stash has a perfect right to determine who's allowed to apply. Myself, I'd
sign up in a second for a contest limited to poets named Mark Weiss. Hell,
I'd even judge it for free.

Oh chreisstopher (m)a(r)le(xander)

This is sooo exciting. Now I have some questions. Will NC-Weissetal permit
multiple entries of the same poem? If we don't have the right name, but we
have the right telephone # will that be ok? How about if we've only been
able to get our vowels enhanced, but are on the waiting list for the
consonant operation?Will that be ok? I understand you don't return
originals. Will you send back the copies? How about if we enclose an SASE
with carbon paper. Would you mind copying it for me and sending the copy of
the copy? Do we just need to advance the poetics of Mark Weiss or do we
need to look like him too? Are arbitrary commas permitted? Tildes? Will
their be a genitalia exam (and whose judging that?). Will it have any
exogenital critieria (like dental flossing or hemmorhoidal creme
application)? A flotilla race? A sopapilla bake-off after the contest?
Please Let me know as soon as possible.

Look you guys. This is getting to be a drag. Please carry useless chatter into the
realms of the back-channel.

On other notes, school has started in Buffalo. Several interesting new students,
including some in the poetics camp. The rain here has been nonstop. Much Bills
chatter and I return to my half-hour commute to campus debating whether to
tune in the likes of Charlie Rose or someone named Jim Rome (?) who speaks in a
language I'm not quite familar with.

I'm curious about these other poetics channels, and regret not being privy to the
remarkable eulogies of Hannah W. that have been posted there. Please cross post.
Even better, I'd be delighted at knowing if these lists are open to the public.

It seems to be a sad year, full of death and loss, moreso than I can remember (I
did turn 30 less than a month ago, so I can speak with some authority here!) and
the enthusiasm of new grad students makes me both sick and excited.

Let's change the subject to Jackson Mac Low, who is 75 today!!

stop bickering--ok?

In 1921, Hermann Rorschach came up with the "Inkblot Test," and Einstein
spoke at Columbia on "The Fourth Dimension".....and Jackson Mac Low was
conceived. Today is his 75th birthday, and many happy returns to Jackson!
Among the commemorative tributes planned, as many on the List will know, is
an issue of _Crayon_ devoted to commentary on Jackson's life & works....And
this is, I believe, due any day now. David

What great poems have produced from

filling out the 50 minutes of Intro to Poetry

Do the writers we know and admire really

I first met Hannah on my first literary trip east of the Mississippi, circa
1980, at an opening as I recall of a show of Lee Sherry's. I was in the
midst of telling Lee how much I liked the work when Hannah walked up, paused
for a moment, declared in something akin to a stage whisper "It says 'go
away'" and stalked off, offended. My eyes dilated, I tracked her down and
got that straightened out. It was the first -- and last -- argument we ever
had. And from it grew a friendship that, like her writing, was simply
impossible to duplicate.

Hannah would call maybe once a month (more often during the bad times),
sometimes insisting that I had "told" her to call (especially if she was
calling at an inconvenient time of night). We would discuss her latest
problems, which often had to do with the American Indian Movement or various
publishers, my kids, readings, friends, her interest in music (she was a 60s
folk rock fan), whatever. Depending on how she was doing at the time, the
calls could range anywhere from absolutely straightforward to utterly
impossible.

Hannah was as insecure as any writer on this list, but for her this never
came out as worrying about this or that revision -- she had absolute
confidence in her writing practice-- but instead in her publications. I
always felt that her paranoia about whether this or that publisher was going
to slight her work, especially through delays was more pronounced since, not
working and with no immediate family, publishing literally was her life --
even moreso as she became more and more reclusive. While I had a completely
easy time with her and her work in In the American Tree (in sharp contrast
with a couple of folks), it seemed apparent, from her accounts as well as
theirs, that Hannah was an absolute terror to her book publishers. All of
them are to be praised for the infinite patience it must have required to
complete each book.

In the mid-80s, Hannah came to California and stayed with Krishna and I in
San Francisco as we gave readings at the Arts Commission Gallery and in Mill
Valley. It was her first trip west and we were prepared to show her all the
sights, but she had no interest whatever in going outside once she was at
our house. Getting her to and from the readings was work enough. (This was
before either Krishna or I had learned how to drive, so it was all public
transit.) Afterwards, I realized that I'd learned in an unspoken way just
how disorienting and even frightening the external world had become for her.
She was profoundly interested in it, but was very protective of her psyche
and quite conscious of her limits. She was a remarkably quiet guest during
those few days. In fact, I probably received phone calls in which she said
more than she did while at our house.

Hannah was very interested in kids, especially in the idea of having boys.
At various points, Asa Watten, Ben Sherry, Felix Bernstein and my son Jesse
were all identified by her as "silent teachers." While she and Jesse spoke
on the phone a few times and he's heard the works that refer to him, they
never got to meet in person.

I was raised by a grandmother who was psychotic and don't take the
circumstance lightly. When Hannah was on her meds, she could be remarkably
matter of fact about her own situation, but often she was not on her meds
and they tend to be the sorts of things that can get mixed and muddled too
easily. When, in the 60s, psychiatry in this country moved literally
millions of people out of institutions back into communities, there was an
assumption (even stated boldly in places such as California) that local
governments would set up the resources to support them. I know from my
experience in the Tenderloin that, with help, it's not that difficult. (My
wife did this for a living for years with many clients in far worse shape
than Hannah.) I often felt that Hannah would have benefited greatly from a
program such as the one Krishna had worked in. Now I wonder if she might not
still be alive if it had existed for her. It's not a fun thought.

I've written about Hannah's work before, so won't duplicate that here, but I
do want to note that when I used the word "realism" in the subtitle of Tree
and as the title of a selection of langpo in Ironwood, it was Hannah's work
specifically that brought me to this realization. She was an awesome
documentarian of a minority reality and if you read her use of pauses,
punctuation (including half-erased lettering), and multiple voices, you
discover both how complex and completely realized her texts are.

I miss her terribly,

Ron

Speaking of just one example, and "exercises" may not be the right
word. A couple of decades ago, for me, looking at the procedures in
some of the works of Jackson Mac Low, at that time particularly in
the Light Poems, and the Presidents of the United States poems, and
The Pronouns -- was extremely valuable. Inventing procedures of my
own and working through them came out of reading and thinking about
such poems. The practice not only produced poems I still value, but,
through the results of such work, changed ways I thought about how
one makes poems and what makes a dynamic piece of literature. These
values have also influenced work I do when not following
procedures as such.

So, yes, I think exercises can be valuable, sometimes writers we know
and admire do use them, and not just as class filler.

Finnegan's proposed exercise in which one takes half the words of a great
work sounds great! But is it the first half of each word, the first half
of each work, or something else altogether? And if I choose a great work
from French, say, the Inferno, or Comment j'ai ecrit certain de mes livres
can I do a sound translation, for extra credit?

And if I bring in the works of John Ashbery, David Shapiro, Bernadette
Mayer, Jackson Mac Low and Lee Ann Brown... would it undercut that I
am pleased by resistance to what if it went unchecked could be called the
hubris of literary scientia?

eh?

James Finnegan Asked, "What great poems have been produced from writing
exercises?"  I don't know about great, but one of my favorite poems,
Keats's *On the Grasshopper and Cricket*, was the result of an exercise.
I'm hazy on the details, but some kind of sonnet-writing contest was
suggested at a gathering of poets, and Keats batted out the preceding in
competition with Leigh Hunt (I think).  Shelley might have participated,
too, I'm not sure.

There's also the example of the obviously exercise poems that begin
Shakespeare's sonnet sequence.

In any event, I'm definitely with Charles Alexander about the value of
procedure poems/exercise poems/what-if-I-do-this poems.  Even if nothing
comes from working on such poems in a workshop, the experience of
what-iffing has to be valuable.

Saddened by news of old, old friend Hannah.  We met in '64 in Kenneth Koch's
New School poetry workshop.  She was even then thinking of alternative
poetries, and when she visited me the following year in Spain during my
expatriate number she'd already begun to draft out Code of Flag Behavior in
which I performed as a signal man at G Stern's loft in the late sixties.
Many memories now, not only of her highly original poetry but of her
sweetness, her generosity and the exercise wherever possible of her canny
and genuine zaniness.

Chris A. --

thanks for forwarding the contest announcement (I've not as
interested in a contest since I was olded out of Yalie Younger Po).

One techno question:

> This competition is open to any poet named Mark Weiss.

From what I hear on the bahn, David Bromige would appear to be
included within the set of all poets named Mark Weiss, neh?  And I
also seem to recollect news that David Israel is tantamont to David
Bromige (or maybe it's the other way around . . . I'm a mite
confused or a confused mite).

Able to Describe the Verses

    (after Neruda)

Able to describe the verses more sad each night.

In the night like the two of them between my arms.
They kissed like tarantulas beneath an infinite sky.

She quizzed me, I quizzed her back.
As if I had a friend with big fizzy eyes.

Able to exactly as I said before.
Thinking that I can't go on. Feeling lost.

Ear to immensity's night, immense with her.
On the other hand my soul turns rocks into paste.

What does it matter my love can't guard its shame.
The night is starry & she isn't with me still.

So much for death. For song with its laws. For laws.
My soul is not contented with having lost her someplace.

As if she were here, I admire her hair suit.
My heart her hair suit, & she isn't in it.

The mismatched night blanks out the mismatched trees.
Our sisters, those who entice, the same backwards as forwards.

I don't know why, that's certain, perhaps I should ask her.
My voice grows furry as it blows about her idea.

The other. Be the Other. Come kiss me like before.
Her voice, her clear form.  Her infinite pupils.

Why is night like the two of them between my arms:
my discontented soul with the beauty it has lost.

Why I don't know for sure, maybe we'll discuss some ways.
The short tan of love, the large tan of oblivion.

Although this sea is the ultimate sadness she can cause me,
&, as I told Sean, this is the ultimate paper boat I shall make her.


**********

I wrote this upon the suggestion that one write a "fake translation" (or
"homophonic" version) from a poem in a language one didn't know. At that
time blissfully incapable of Spanish, I took Neruda's "Lament" (from his
first book, I think titled _18 poems of love and one lament_). I departed
from the homophonic discipline frequently, as a quick check of my poem
against Neruda's must disclose. But I could not have written this w/o
Neruda to distract me from my habitual vocabulary/subject matter/syntax.
Whether it is what James Finnegan would call a "great poem" I must doubt,
but I've always liked it and prefer it to the grandiosities of the
original.

The larger picture is, that such exercises help place one where the poem is
no longer a confessional box, or rather, where it _is_ a confessional box,
and seen as such,and one can describe its construction instead of dwelling
on the hard luck of its temporary inhabitant. Poetry has always employed
such devices to distract the poet & thereby allow something new to emerge
from his/her programmed mind--as programmed as the next member of society,
poet or no. When these devices become too familiar, and susceptible of glib
usage, it is time to come up with fresh ones. With my education, riming
iambic pentameters was no challenge. Making a piece out of items from the
local newspaper was, and the result, "One Spring," can be found in _Men,
Women & Vehicles_ (Black Sparrow, 1990); it won a Pushcart Prize in 1980,
upon its publication in _This_ journal.

I, Dave, testify in the courts of the Law, taking myself as example, but
among my colleagues'sproductions are many, many fine poems that stemmed, to
one degree or another, from just such defamiliarizing procedures. One of
these colleagues, John Keats, has already been mentioned in this thread; it
bears remembering that his Odes were the result of a new stanza form, no
matter he was raiding, among others, Spenser for "inspiration".

Seeing That You Asked

In this world there's a secret
& it belongs to me, to me
& to someone who lives in here with me.

When my brother dreams
he shivers.  Instead of night
he sees these things.
When he takes a walk & sees something
it makes marks on his forehead
in small drops of blood.

A dream's when you see people.

The dream is in the smoke.
When you wake up
it's right in front of you.

The light makes dreams.
Dreams come to pay us back
& wake us up.

If you dream you're dressed
you see a picture.
As long as there's a picture in the room
I can never be alone.
Statues & pictures aren't alive.
They can only think & see.

The wind makes the grass move
& you see it move.
That is thinking.

When you can't remember something
then you think.

A horse thinks with its ears.
A curious thought came into my head :
I must give up my horse
to make my mother better.
It was made of wood, with real hair.

Could this chair have been called "Stuhl"?
Yes, that is a word in German.
Who gave things German names?
God, & the Germans.

A dog knows its name
but does a fish? It should,
if we know we belong, why shouldn't fish.

The name of the moon
isn't in the moon.
The sun's name's in the voice
that says it.

The clouds' name
is in the clouds
because they're gray.

As for the pencil,
it's printed on its side.

Looking into great literature unquote and then writing, as a formula, has a
downside, namely, pale imitation. For one thing, it appears to overlook the

Yet it is this very accomodation that gives a poem its edge.

Looking into one's heart & writing, Phil Sidney's Muse's formula, hardly

was a teacher in creative writing classes, students who looked into their
hearts & wrote usually sounded like Hallmark clones. I think that's because
the heart is seldom where you look for it. I know that there is more of me
in these two poems I include here, than I ever would have revealed had I
been focussing on my self, my heart, etc.  David

Able to Describe the Verses

    (after Neruda)

Able to describe the verses more sad each night.

In the night like the two of them between my arms.
They kissed like tarantulas beneath an infinite sky.

She quizzed me, I quizzed her back.
As if I had a friend with big fizzy eyes.

Able to exactly as I said before.
Thinking that I can't go on. Feeling lost.

Ear to immensity's night, immense with her.
On the other hand my soul turns rocks into paste.

What does it matter my love can't guard its shame.
The night is starry & she isn't with me still.

So much for death. For song with its laws. For laws.
My soul is not contented with having lost her someplace.

As if she were here, I admire her hair suit.
My heart her hair suit, & she isn't in it.

The mismatched night blanks out the mismatched trees.
Our sisters, those who entice, the same backwards as forwards.

I don't know why, that's certain, perhaps I should ask her.
My voice grows furry as it blows about her idea.

The other. Be the Other. Come kiss me like before.
Her voice, her clear form.  Her infinite pupils.

Why is night like the two of them between my arms:
my discontented soul with the beauty it has lost.

Why I don't know for sure, maybe we'll discuss some ways.
The short tan of love, the large tan of oblivion.

Although this sea is the ultimate sadness she can cause me,
&, as I told Sean, this is the ultimate paper boat I shall make her.


**********

I wrote this upon the suggestion that one write a "fake translation" (or
"homophonic" version) from a poem in a language one didn't know. At that
time blissfully incapable of Spanish, I took Neruda's "Lament" (from his
first book, I think titled _18 poems of love and one lament_). I departed
from the homophonic discipline frequently, as a quick check of my poem
against Neruda's must disclose. But I could not have written this w/o
Neruda to distract me from my habitual vocabulary/subject matter/syntax.
Whether it is what James Finnegan would call a "great poem" I must doubt,
but I've always liked it and prefer it to the grandiosities of the
original.

The larger picture is, that such exercises help place one where the poem is
no longer a confessional box, or rather, where it _is_ a confessional box,
and seen as such,and one can describe its construction instead of dwelling
on the hard luck of its temporary inhabitant. Poetry has always employed
such devices to distract the poet & thereby allow something new to emerge
from his/her programmed mind--as programmed as the next member of society,
poet or no. When these devices become too familiar, and susceptible of glib
usage, it is time to come up with fresh ones. With my education, riming
iambic pentameters was no challenge. Making a piece out of items from the
local newspaper was, and the result, "One Spring," can be found in _Men,
Women & Vehicles_ (Black Sparrow, 1990); it won a Pushcart Prize in 1980,
upon its publication in _This_ journal.

I, Dave, testify in the courts of the Law, taking myself as example, but
among my colleagues'sproductions are many, many fine poems that stemmed, to
one degree or another, from just such defamiliarizing procedures. One of
these colleagues, John Keats, has already been mentioned in this thread; it
bears remembering that his Odes were the result of a new stanza form, no
matter he was raiding, among others, Spenser for "inspiration".

Seeing That You Asked

In this world there's a secret
& it belongs to me, to me
& to someone who lives in here with me.

When my brother dreams
he shivers.  Instead of night
he sees these things.
When he takes a walk & sees something
it makes marks on his forehead
in small drops of blood.

A dream's when you see people.

The dream is in the smoke.
When you wake up
it's right in front of you.

The light makes dreams.
Dreams come to pay us back
& wake us up.

If you dream you're dressed
you see a picture.
As long as there's a picture in the room
I can never be alone.
Statues & pictures aren't alive.
They can only think & see.

The wind makes the grass move
& you see it move.
That is thinking.

When you can't remember something
then you think.

A horse thinks with its ears.
A curious thought came into my head :
I must give up my horse
to make my mother better.
It was made of wood, with real hair.

Could this chair have been called "Stuhl"?
Yes, that is a word in German.
Who gave things German names?
God, & the Germans.

A dog knows its name
but does a fish? It should,
if we know we belong, why shouldn't fish.

The name of the moon
isn't in the moon.
The sun's name's in the voice
that says it.

The clouds' name
is in the clouds
because they're gray.

As for the pencil,
it's printed on its side.

I'm sure I was hasty in my summary dismissal of
writing exericises. And, certainly, I'm aware
that "great poems" and "good books"
are not going to be the same texts for everyone.
Exercises, for students, are certainly
useful in art and music schools, so why
not in creative writing schools?

But many of the exercises are so damn silly. Some
are like the various improbable cures
for hiccups people have, only the idea behind
these is "to unblock or to free the creative impulse
of the writer." Does the world need more refrigerator
magnet poems?

Now I don't teach, so I don't have clue how hard
or easy it is to teach creative writing. And I imagine
any tool will be worthwhile in the hands of a good teacher.
But in talking with writers, I never seem to hear one say
(or should I say, admit) that a certain writing exercise
was the basis for a breakthrough in his/her writing--
"Last night, before going to bed, I cut out words from the
Personals section of the newspaper, then I placed them
in my pillowcase. Next morning I shook them out on
the sheet and wrote a love poem like I've never written
before." Perhaps most poets prefer not to credit the
exercise because of its inherent artificiality.

David Bromige's homophonic version of Neruda's "Lament" provoked me to
the following massacree of Neruda's "Ode to French Fries" [from _Odes to
Common Things_, Little, Brown: 1996]. My ignorance of Spanish no doubt
vies with Bromige's, but I like the sense of looking through
centuries-old glass at an event not quite identifiable yet fascinating

We go to school & learn the rules of grammar, we grow up & learn social
behavior, how to behave in a seemly manner so as not to make ourselves
impossible, etc.  Writing exercises are meant to shake up those rules by
means of new rules - instigate exploration of new possibilities.
But I agree with Finnegan that technique fades quickly into gimmimimicry
which easily kills poetry.  To mistake techniques for creativity &
imagination - this is another aspect of the great rationalist leveler
in all of us which grinds down the unique & inexplicable into categories
& explained stuff. The necessary image or motive draws the handy technique
like a magnet - exactly the OPPOSITE process from the classroom experiment.
I'm sure the authentic poet-teachers out there make that clear, but I wouldn't
know.

I wrote a poem once, a long poem, called White City.  About halfway through
I started alluding or echoing previous particular lines in a mathematical
way - & simultaneously creating sort of a Finneganesque distortion.
I did discover something ODD doing this - toward the end of the poem as the
math-allusions got more dense & the distortions more severe, the poem
started to tell a story - a narrative-inside-the-poem.  My point is that
in my mind the only clear benefit of this "technique" is that it led to
something unplanned.  If that hadn't happened, the gimmick would have
laid siege to & eventually strangled White City.  - Henry Gould

Unless I'm misreading what Henry's saying in his latest posting, I
disagree with him in a couple of spots.  First of all, I don't see that
technique NECESSARILY fades quickly into "gimmimimicry" any more than
images or motives necessarily fade quickly into cliche.  Nor do I
understand why it would be a "mistake" to confuse techniques for
creativity and imagination.  What's uncreative about inventing a new
technique, or using an old one brilliantly?  Why shouldn't an effective
technique "draw" the right image as easily as the reverse?  Sure, a poem
that's all technique is unlikely to be too hot, but why would a poem
that's all image or motive be any better?

Anyhow, my practice as a poet is to take anything I can as a starting
point; if it's an image, then I hunt for a technique that'll unprose it;
if a technique, then I hunt for an image it'll work with.  Consistent
result: all my poems that use post-1950 techniques get accused of being
mere gimmickry.

In reply to Bob Grumman: technique doesn't NECESSARILY fade into
gimmimicry.  I said it EASILY fades into said.  As image & motive do
into cliche, as you say.  I'm seeing it like a spatial continuum I guess,
not a logical outcome.  Technique/gimmick.  Image/cliche.

All WRITING is technique.  But poetry isn't encompassed by writing.
(Maybe Derrida disagrees, I dunno.)  Writing programs sell "writing."
Like, you too can be a capital P.  Here, try these techniques.

Imagination/creativity get processed & sold too, as we know.  But I still
say they are different from technique.  Sure, there's imaginative use of techni
que.  No argument there.  But technique, on the other hand, is no proof of
imagination - in fact it's often a crutch (in the avant-garde as well as the
retro-garde) for lack of same.  Check your own lame lines (everybody).
Inflated blurb as interpretant of smooth gimmick.

Creativity - is that a juicier way of putting it than imagination?
Or how about "inscape".  Then there's always "fate".

The poem is a stone fallen from heaven.
No one judges it.  (Mandelstam)

I find it odd that James Finnegan writes that he never hears a poet admit
that such-&-such an exercise led to a breakthru in his poetry, so soon
after I posted two poems which I said were that, for me. Perhaps others on
this List would care to testify to the value of some writing exercise
either to their own poetry, or that of others. David

I characterize this century as the one of "form will set you free".  Form,
no form, different form, form exercises, form-is-content, content-is-form,
form as language, language as form, form-of-thought, no-thought-form, a sea
of forms eroding continents of form bequeathed.

The rats eat my notebooks of form and I am glad they are nourished.  There
was a time when all I had was form and Neruda and myself.  I exercised an
exploration of the place Neruda showed me.  Twenty exercises and a poem,
Twenty love poems and La Cancion Desesperada.

Play is creative, liberating and prepares us for what we live when play is

'great poems' and 'breakthrus' are stoppers since i can't claim either and
won't if/until more than a few tell me otherwise - but here's a few that
came/were-directly prompted by exercises the past few months:

'Homo Vocalis'  -  (Recursive Angel) ex. from Alien flowers (Joy Acey)
'Hot Oil' - (Zuzu's Petal's) - ex. from Poetry Cafe
'Natural Practices - ex. from Alien Flowers (Tom Williams)
'Ballad of Emma Good' - ex. from APW (Janet Holmes)
'Still Life with Moon' - ex. from APW (scott Reid)
'Still Life with Statue' (current finalist PEII) - Tom Williams ex.
'Isle du Goree' - ex. Alien Flowers (Mary Tomaselli)
'15th day of Prana' - ex. Alien Flowers (Joy Acey)
'Two Brushes' - soco poets (Layne Russell)
et. al.

here's a couple - nothing shattering, avant or langpo - but if they look
like exercises then I stand corrected.

Still Life with Statue

She stands for seeming hours,
mimes hardly moving, imperceptible
changes query in the hesitant ranges,
moves on over open ground, soundless.

She has finally mastered invisibility,
sewed a cloak that bends the light
to impossibly uninteresting angles
barely breathing at the margins;
a sustained aikedo defeating attention.

In Mauroc they remove the shine,
cover with hijab, deform glances,
walk astride a hobbled gait as if to say
Allah has not visited, who wants that?

She says nothing, involves no one,
her immobility stretches over canvass,
no startled birds emerge, white gesso
glaze redoubles the sunlight, hiding
the texture of grass at her feet,
stones cover her eyes.

He is young, vibrant, attentive,
a gaze that says you need to know,
shows good teeth, speaks taste
and patience while a brief gust
blows a kiss of paper cup her way,
a make-do vase for a sudden bouquet
thought that withers without an address.

The small hour brushes shady hues
across the vacant stare of afternoon.
Stones cave inward, so densely grey
Erato's arbor only thickens in its wall
at the silence of such perfect refutation.
While nightfall drapes,

                          a dust cloud on the pond
                          studies her reflection.

------------
Natural Practices



As a child, i run my fingers over stone feeling
shadows flee, not idle time for me brailling the earth
this way, lessons for the day when i must choose
how to walk upon living things; and when i run
my fingers bumpity-bumpity over the fence holes
is it not to inspect the notions of worlds within worlds
that someday i will meet behind barriers i must overcome,
wish them away that i may heed any beckon from beyond?
And on a sunny day, if i should dig a hole in the yard
and then crawl down into the cool dampness of earth
pressed to my back and trace the meaning of my eye
as it slowly moves along the strata of a hundred years,
have i not begun to puzzle the riddle of my ancestors,
the chains of being that are forged and reforged
with each succession?

When i pick my nose i am amazed that portions of my body
detach in such pliant supple forms that tickle strangely
wet and gelled in unpredictable shapes, sweet and sour.
And should i not wonder at the ways i will become, the parts
of me that will liquefy and slide along the demanding trails
and impossibly dry narrow crawl-ways that lie before me?
When i touch my toes, is it not a journey in enumeration
of places unrevealed for which i am already highly adapted;
write simple lessons on the bilateral symmetry of wiggling things?
When i reach into the not quite there, absent and unformed,
vague thoughts watch the ten great teachers of the world disappear
into a mist beyond which i cannot penetrate, where the star-shaped limbs of
me are radially motivated. Should i not wonder if this vanishing point
continues to grow, to consume until
there is no more me?

I play among the eidos in the second-hand shop of God,
filled with things known only by their gestures long after
the costumes which once wore them have departed. I string
the gestures into beads of thought, the thoughts into rosaries
of vision, the visions into new costumes. With these I will confront
the gestures of the unknown, again and again, like a scimitar
without a Saracen. And if the blade turns upon itself, slicing through
the string of questions, what then? In the mirror of antiquities
I see my reflection instantly melanize and disappear. Should I
not try to illuminate the eidolon that lives there and dines on angels when
it can; forages for passing shadow scraps when it cannot?  And if I find
it, do I also become dark and gloomy? Is it here, in this soundless priory
of hallways, the vanished parts have gone,
to haunt me forever, as a man?

there is another way i've used exercises - as sketches and problem solvers
for other more ambitious pieces. For instance, 'Still Life with Statue' was
first suggested as an exercise in which the central figure had to be
entirely passive - no voice/no action - At the same time I had been working
on a much larger piece, 'Glimpses' that required a full description of a
figure that hardly appears. SLS was used to solve some of those problems
and the solutions transfered to the longer work. In that, I felt the
process somewhat akin to the plastic or visual arts where preliminary
sketches or models (exercises) may be made - and become works in their own
right. In SLS the sketch did not resemble an actual part of the larger work
- but still the process felt similar to one i'd used in sculpting and
painting.

What does Bob Grumman mean by hunting for a technique to "unprose"
an image?  Does this suggest something like that word "versify"?
As in, "William, those daffodils look so gay, ever glancing, ever
changing!"  A poet could not but be gay to unprose that.

At the risk of being obvious, the Greek word for art was techne.  Not
suggesting we should all wear short skirts and carry shields, though I'm not
against that either.

Is there any reason why the two approaches: deliberation/inspiration should
be mutually exclusive whether at the same or at different times?  Coming
from a country where thinking is regarded as cheating and all forms of
"holism" routinely excise the intellect I find myself sympathetic to the
idea of writing exercises.  Certainly, having read David Bromige's beautiful
examples this morning, I would find it difficult to accept that such
exercises cannot result in poetry.  Looks like a duck, quacks like a duck,
it's a duck.

Also the idea that writing can be a pleasure, intellectually or otherwise,
becomes unusually attractive when the background count of fake anguish rises
beyond safe limits.  (One year I did a word count on the British Arts
Council's annual anthology and the most frequent lexical extrusion was
"dark", beating even the definite article.)

Read no further unless you are willing to exercise.

Start with one word.  Generate further words by (a) inserting (b) deleting a
letter and (c) anagrammising or inverting the order.  This is part of how
genes mutate.  There follows a 2-dimensional example, taken from a work in
progress (Note to those who feel like giving up after the first line: it's
in the second stanza)

I have often found "exercises" or parameters of some kind to have helped
me produce pieces that took me into new places.  Sometimes the subject
matter alone is the new territory.  I value stimulation in any form that
brings me to write a new poem.  I never value those poems less because
they were instigated in this way.

I tried to answer Mark Baker's inquiry as to what I meant "by hunting
for a technique to 'unprose' an image" with a 300,000-word monograph
plus seventeen attachments, but list-gatekeeper Joel Kuszai for some
reason wouldn't let it through.  So here's a second, shorter try.

A technique to unprose an image is one whose purpose is to lift the
image out of its prosaism, to invest it with a more-than-common sensual
richness.  Versification as in Wordsworth's daffodil poem (another
favorite of mine) would be one such technique, but there are many
others: metaphorization, infra-verbal deconstruction or scrambling (as
Randolph Healy is doing), various visual devices, parataxis,
mathematicalization, even the simple lineation that Williams used to
unprose his red wheelbarrow.  Note: such techniques can be used in
prose--as in a modest way I used neologization to unprose the image (or
concept) "make poetry of" in the prose passage of my previous
posting--since prose needn't be ALL prose, just mainly prose.

Now back to Henry Gould.  I like the Mandelstam quotation--except for
the idea that no one judges poetry.  Everyone judges poetry (and
everything else), however unconsciously.  To be cultured is to judge
consciously.

As for our discussion, I suspect we're close to agreement and just
arguing nuances.  Technique of course can be used as a crutch, as can
anything else in poetry or any other field.  It IS different from
imagination: it's what imagination uses to make art.  Experience plus
technique plus imagination equal art.  Drop any of the three and you get
cleverness without depth (technique plus imagination), confusion
(experience plus imagination) or deadly predictability (experience plus
technique).

I'll second Rebecca's note on play in my own 2 cents.  I use exercises --
the more "rote" and the more silly the better -- as throwaways with
students, treating them as ways to unlock when self-consciousness and the
weight of unassimilated theory makes them nervous.  Sometimes there are
great results, sometimes not, but the trick in order for this to be a
limberer is not to focus on the results but on the play of it.  Or so I've
found.

TRIBUTE TO HANNAH WEINER

Hannah cared immensely about her writing, and she
was interested in having people read and hear her
work. In memory of Hannah, I am offering one of her
major works, SPOKE, at a 50% discount. The price is
$3.50. Please contact me at djmess@sunmoon.com

In memory of Hannah, I am posting, below one of her
later works, an incredible story/memoir/fantasty/
journal titled "astral visions." This will appear
in MR. KNIFE, MISS FORK: PERFORMANCES

i want to discuss astrals, the visions and i want to
begin with paw because he seems to have started his existence
three years ago this coming january and still exists
   the reason to discuss paw is that he is one of the
teachers and gives me instruction continually and in the
three years i've known him, or that he has appeared, he's
grown in intelligence and acuteness and accuracy and he
also happens to be the funniest person that i know he didn't
start out as paw and i will tell you the story
   it all begins the day i went to cancun three years ago when
an invisible man walked into my bedroom and i could just see
the outline of his parka, and he dressed me very slowly, i
was still sweating, (or I was sweating then as well), in a
black lace bra and white cotton panties and then he put a
finger up the leg of my panties and tickled my hip-bone very
chastely and said "coochi-coo" and made me lie very still in
between dressing so i wouldn't sweat the rest of it was up to
me i got on the plane and nothing happened until the meal was
served when there was a voice saying, "ma, eat the chocolate
mousse, ask for more?"
   we got to cancun and i put my suitcase down on a little
table for suitcases, and overhead i heard the clash of arms
after the clash of arms i heard a woman's voice from the yoga
institute saying "well now we unpack our suitcases and put our
undies neatly on the shelf" i automatically began to unzip
the suitcase to unpack it and the invisible man grabbed me
by the back of my parka and made me get undressed i was
soaking wet, my hair, my body, my clothes, everything and he
made me get undressed i hung up my clothes in deference to
the yoga lady i put my underwear and socks in the sink with
some soapy water and the invisible man pushed me into the
shower where I took a shampoo and washed off the sweat the
invisble man disappeared the next thing that happened was
purely mechanical, I tried to get about a half dozen blankets
to wrap myself up in because it was pouring rain and it was
cold i made a blanket roll of five blankets after i discovered
that you lie in the middle and you throw one blanket over
the other, (you begin on one side and rolling over them), and i
put a blanket on top of all that right up to my chin, and under-
neath the blanket appeared the bear
     i don't know that i called him paw at this time or that he
called himself paw at this time, but he was a brown bear and i
could see his head and his eyes and his nose peaking out from
underneath the top blanket and he had one paw chastely placed
on my chest between my breasts saying, "i have a real maw," and
he stayed under the covers for four weeks (i was there for
four weeks trying to get a place out but couldn't) and every
once in awhile he'd say something like, "order more chocolate
cake ma" and "I have a real ma" and "my jaw hurts"
     the interesting thing that i have to say about the bear is
that he's an astral for an indian someone has invented for him-
self an astral that speaks for him in the form of a bear in
some indian legends a bear is a healer, not that paw has ever
done any healing for me,"* but his instructions were bood,
except at the beginning he really wasn't doing too much after
four weeks when the sun came out and it got really hot he walked
out in full brown fur saying, "see you onthe plane ma"

__________
* but I have felt his real self sending me bliss
__________


    [now one thing happened in mexico that i'd like to talk about
and that's the man from sonora who appeared astral this is a little
interlude about paw the man from sonora appeared in my bedroom three
times before i left ny, just his white hat and his long white hair
and once a blanket over his shoulder before the ruins i got the message
the first week i was there that he wanted to meet the woman with the
long pipe (that's me) and he appeared in image form and he showed me a
blanket trick that explained a little bit of castanida to me he was
obviously an ancient mexican teacher who wanted to say certain things
before he died and to pass on some of his knowledge he kept flipping
the blanket (all of these things were very, very vividly seen) the
blanket was sort of like in squares of different colors with a black
outline now the black outline always remained the same but the patterns
and colors of the squares kept changing so the lesson learned from that
you could create an image but you couldn't keep it constant, you had to
keep chaning the image he also had people circling the room, flying over-
head in a circle that's something i'm not able to do myself and neither
or any of the other teachers some of them can fly straight but nobody is
able to circle it isn't really necessary, it's a matter of who is watching
whom it's a way of guarding to have
    the man from sonora told me two things, he said "always give a health
diagnosis out loud" and "to speak slow while speaking silent" because of
the rain and because he wanted to meet me he made a long trip up the road
from the ruins to the hotel and evidently he broke a leg or something
happened and he fell in a ditch by the wayside and one night I woke up crying
and sang a crossing song from "the big huge," it's something about a great
light crossing the river, so i knew the man had died then appeared a woman,
an elderly woman who evidently put a cross by hisbones and who the following
day showed me his white hat, his white shirt, and white pants all neatly
laundered and pressed out, so i know the man had died]
    ok, now the bear lots of other things happened in mexico but i don't
have time for them i want to talk about paw
    when i got home the bear was very small, he had changed shape to a very
small brown bear who lived in a cupboard in my forehead it had blue sheets
and if i looked through catalogs and he saw some clothes that he liked he would
immediately appear with the clothes on particularly a pair of black bicycling
shorts and some wading shoes i tried to keep him occupied and i sent him on
trips one was skiing in south america, and one was sending him to the south
pole, and finally he decided to take his real ma on a honeymoon or whatever,
a vacation and they went aboard a great big ocean liner and she, i think she
was called ma belle, sat on a deck chair lounging on the deck of the ship
and paw, or the bear, was flying overhead in circles because he was bored sitting
on the deck when they got to france they rented a limousine and paw donned a
chauffeurs cap and drove the limousine and all through france all is saw
were pile and iles of spaghetti, that's all they seemed to eat for some reason
also paw invented travelers checks so that he could pay for this whole thing
     this is the imagination of someone whose name is unknown but who has
invented a form through which he can work so this was just sort of fun at the
time you must remember that paw has written a great deal for me he wrote "the
comma" in SILENT TEACHERS with noah kleinman my friend from england and he
wrote "turpitudimous" which i read in october and he also gets in everywhere
when i type up anything for the next book called WE SPEAK SILENT, or whatever
it's going to be called
     finally paw and ma belle landed on a caribbean island, just the two of
them under the shade of a palm tree the next thing i know paw turned into a
great big white bear, not his final form he was called poohee at the time
     i went for a walk in the park and poohee got locked in the apartment
and had to squeeze himself through the keyhole and i was accompanied in imae
form by two people from the yoga institute one dressed in white who was
walking alongside me and one who was dressed in pink who was sort of flying
along beside me and poohee caught up and started smooching, you know he
started sort of leaning over and kissing me or pretending to kiss me, or to
tickle me or to laugh to make it a lovers lane walk and i started to laugh
hysterically and i thought what will ever happen if i'm picked up by somebody,
here i am talking to someone who is invisible an; oh well he was very funny
the next time i went to the park paw* left the path and went over to some
antique fair and came back with a velvet vest on it was a lilac velvet vest
with red braid and green stones and an earring i laughed
     i talked to a girlfriend on the phone a few nights later and she was a
very beautiful girl and paw clued me into the fact that i was talking to a very
beautiful woman and he went out to see her and the next morning he appeared
combing hair out of his teeth and the green stones were gone from his vest
somewhere along the way his real ma got pregnant and we were walking along
14th street with the open stalls and he saw a bunch of little girls dresses
he wanted a "pinkie" as he called it little girls dresses with little angel
sleeves and some towels so he quickly donned a striped apron and cap imaged
a big cart in front of him and trundled off piles of baby dresses with angel
wing sleeves and towels, and brought them back to the apartment and we had
to box them and ship them and send them all to his home he used to sit on the
bed next to me reading the new york times with steel rimmed glasses the last
time i really saw paw in any remarkable circumstance was at woodstock he had
disappeared for awhile, he said "maw I have to go hime, something important
is happening" and i was having breakfast at a coffee shop and there appeared
paw sitting across the table from me with a big grin and next to him was a
white lady bear, a daintier, felt to be a gentle with a wreath and a long
bridal veil and they were toasting each other in white coffee cups that
was the summer i hurt my back and the lady bear would appear with a pink
apron and a cup on a tray and would bring me coffee or tea or whatever well
i guess that's paw no maw im still really working hard besides paw and mrs
paw there is a baby bear.

*he was now in his final form, a large white bear with a big fat tummy.

TRIBUTE TO HANNAH WEINER

Hannah cared immensely about her writing, and she
was interested in having people read and hear her
work. In memory of Hannah, I am offering one of her
major works, SPOKE, at a 50% discount. The price is
$3.50. Please contact me at djmess@sunmoon.com

In memory of Hannah, I am posting, below one of her
later works, an incredible story/memoir/fantasty/
journal titled "astral visions." This will appear
in MR. KNIFE, MISS FORK: PERFORMANCES

i want to discuss astrals, the visions and i want to
begin with paw because he seems to have started his existence
three years ago this coming january and still exists
   the reason to discuss paw is that he is one of the
teachers and gives me instruction continually and in the
three years i've known him, or that he has appeared, he's
grown in intelligence and acuteness and accuracy and he
also happens to be the funniest person that i know he didn't
start out as paw and i will tell you the story
   it all begins the day i went to cancun three years ago when
an invisible man walked into my bedroom and i could just see
the outline of his parka, and he dressed me very slowly, i
was still sweating, (or I was sweating then as well), in a
black lace bra and white cotton panties and then he put a
finger up the leg of my panties and tickled my hip-bone very
chastely and said "coochi-coo" and made me lie very still in
between dressing so i wouldn't sweat the rest of it was up to
me i got on the plane and nothing happened until the meal was
served when there was a voice saying, "ma, eat the chocolate
mousse, ask for more?"
   we got to cancun and i put my suitcase down on a little
table for suitcases, and overhead i heard the clash of arms
after the clash of arms i heard a woman's voice from the yoga
institute saying "well now we unpack our suitcases and put our
undies neatly on the shelf" i automatically began to unzip
the suitcase to unpack it and the invisible man grabbed me
by the back of my parka and made me get undressed i was
soaking wet, my hair, my body, my clothes, everything and he
made me get undressed i hung up my clothes in deference to
the yoga lady i put my underwear and socks in the sink with
some soapy water and the invisible man pushed me into the
shower where I took a shampoo and washed off the sweat the
invisble man disappeared the next thing that happened was
purely mechanical, I tried to get about a half dozen blankets
to wrap myself up in because it was pouring rain and it was
cold i made a blanket roll of five blankets after i discovered
that you lie in the middle and you throw one blanket over
the other, (you begin on one side and rolling over them), and i
put a blanket on top of all that right up to my chin, and under-
neath the blanket appeared the bear
     i don't know that i called him paw at this time or that he
called himself paw at this time, but he was a brown bear and i
could see his head and his eyes and his nose peaking out from
underneath the top blanket and he had one paw chastely placed
on my chest between my breasts saying, "i have a real maw," and
he stayed under the covers for four weeks (i was there for
four weeks trying to get a place out but couldn't) and every
once in awhile he'd say something like, "order more chocolate
cake ma" and "I have a real ma" and "my jaw hurts"
     the interesting thing that i have to say about the bear is
that he's an astral for an indian someone has invented for him-
self an astral that speaks for him in the form of a bear in
some indian legends a bear is a healer, not that paw has ever
done any healing for me,"* but his instructions were bood,
except at the beginning he really wasn't doing too much after
four weeks when the sun came out and it got really hot he walked
out in full brown fur saying, "see you onthe plane ma"

__________
* but I have felt his real self sending me bliss
__________


    [now one thing happened in mexico that i'd like to talk about
and that's the man from sonora who appeared astral this is a little
interlude about paw the man from sonora appeared in my bedroom three
times before i left ny, just his white hat and his long white hair
and once a blanket over his shoulder before the ruins i got the message
the first week i was there that he wanted to meet the woman with the
long pipe (that's me) and he appeared in image form and he showed me a
blanket trick that explained a little bit of castanida to me he was
obviously an ancient mexican teacher who wanted to say certain things

This is a review written a few years ago which I never published thinking to
say more. Hannah thought it was done. Looking at it now, she was right.


HANNAH Hi

on _silent teachers / remembered sequel_, Hannah Weiner, Tender Buttons,
$7.95.


_particles marm, have we discussed particles_

The thing about being
clairvoyant is the multiplicity
can't be divided. Time
causes the trouble of keeping
up. Seeing so much simultaneously
that the depend & the enact
gather the motion into each
each-- it can get kinda
spikey

_i free     i see     super working silent_

Location leads to narrative.
Narrative leads to namings (i.e. motions (i emotions ( in others (i, i, i,
i))).

This is WRITING
(_also drumming_) -- a bunk
as in bed that implicates
all friends. Hannah has
it.
Technical talk:
Narrative of where is it.
No Nylon.
                Nobody won't not

publish this in this since--

they all see words w/out

since. That's a key

(canons in cities) which being brightly (like a phone call from fire) would
cause one to speak 3-D SO all I mean is read this book out loud period
period dot & period

I do teach writing, to 4th graders and mental health clients and high
school students and working adults. Excersizes help people relax,
especially when they don't already have a writing practice. the most
talented students I have often saythey never write on their own, because
they don't know how to get themselves started. When they have a list of
open-ended options, they often do start, at least a little. My point as a
teacher is entirely to get people writing, anything; once they have this
habit, the journey takes them. I use Natalie GOldberg, John Gardener's The
Art of Fiction, the new Practice of Poetry edited by Twitchell and Behn,
stuff I make up, stuff kids suggest. (One popular one: "I'm hungry
for....")
        Whatever helps, helps.

Subject:      Re: Hannah Weiner (1928-1997)

My condolences to Charles Bernstein & others who were close to Hannah
Weiner.  Over the past ten or twelve years, I taught Hannah's writing
in my contemporary poetry classes, and I corresponded a bit with her
about her writing and about teaching her work.  Initially, her
writing would evoke great skepticism (particularly among the graduate
students in creative writing).  Of course, we found various analogous
writings in our immediate surroundings--mystic script writing of a
number of folk artists, for example (JB Murry, the Reverend Perkins,
Howard Finster, Fred Webster, and so on).  Others have commented on
the fusion of the personal and the experimental in Hannah's writing;
I was also struck by the politics of it, especially with regard to
Native American activism.  Once in my life, I was invited to read in
NCY, and did so at The Ear Inn.  I was absolutely thrilled when
Hannah introduced herself to me.  When I was teaching her work, at
some point the intensity and vulnerability of her word-vision
experience hit me, and continues to hit me....  In many ways, she
has helped me to see words in ways I had not known before.

In fourth grade we were supposed to write five sentences a week, each one
containing one spelling word, so that we would have used 25% of the words
given each week.  Bored (and I'm sure quite obnoxious about it) I would
instead write a twenty-line rhymed and metered poem with a spelling word in
every line.  The poems were absolutely awful, even for a fourth grader, but
the experience of struggling with the language under those tight
constraints absolutely invaluable.

Seems to be two kinds of exercises in this thread: nuts-and-bolts focus on
language, and the above.  They are so different from each other I can't
even think of them in the same breath.

Subject:      ILS 7: Ellingham/Killian on Spicer
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Lewis Ellingham and Kevin Killian's riveting account of "Five Years in the
Life of Jack Spicer" was published as the seventh installment of the
Impercipient Lecture Series earlier this month.  A preview of the biography
forthcoming next year from Wesleyan, this chapter documents with lush and
knowing detail the years 1950-1955.  Picking up with his brief stint in
Minneapolis, and depositing him in Boston isolation, this period also
includes a stretch in the more familiar environs of the Bay area, where
Spicer "was living a full, almost schizophrenic life--teaching at
C[alifornia] S[chool] of F[ine] A[rt], sitting the Gallery, drinking at The
Place, participating in the 'Old Ladies' Bridge Club' in Berkeley on
Fridays, keeping in touch with his mother in Los Angeles, attending
Mattachine meetings (now in San Francisco), and trying to continue his
long-term project, the _Imaginary Elegies_" (26).

That's the good news.  The bad news is that only two or three copies remain
from the initial run of 150, so chances are you'll have to borrow (or
xerox) one from a friend.  However, if you'd like to be kept in mind in the
event of a small reprint, let us know.

up with the ILS on the EPC by visiting

What with all the very sad news of Hannah
Weiner's death, I thought it might also be
good to have some positive news.

In todays NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW, Bernadette
Mayer has a poem on the end sheet, titled
"A Very Short Anthology of New Verse." Her
poem, "Eleventh Cup," (published originally in
TORQUE) was reprinted by the TIMES from my anthology,
THE GERTRUDE STEIN AWARDS INNOVATIVE AMERICAN POETRY
1994-1995. I'm currently working on the 1995-1996
edition.

You have an image in front of you now.  It's not daffodils, nor is it
wheelbarrows.  It does have commonness, and its sensual richness is
masked by your efforts to construe the semantics of these signs you
are now reading.

I asked my students on Friday to write an exercise, of
the kind Finnegan would likely detest.  Take the poem everyone knows;
rewrite it on a medium your writing now depends upon.

My effort follows below.
I'll submit your better efforts to my students.

Unprose this image before you.

Somewhere among the many moving descriptions of Hannah Weiner I recall a
brief suggestion that she was somewhat self-protective about 'information
exposure'. I wonder if anyone can tell me what her own reading habits were
like - spare, selective, avaricious, serendipitous...? What were some of
her favorites?  post or bkchn - red.

Did somebody say deliberation & inspiration were mutually exclusive?  I said
poetry & writing are often mutually exclusive.  Finnegan's skepticism
won't ever be too popular, not among a crowd whose bread & butter is
turning poetry into various classroom techniques.  How many people have
written to the list now to tell us how exciting it is to experiment, how
productive?  Fine.  Hey, poetry is the thing.  Anybody against poetry here?

We agree on a lot of things.  Finnegan's position, which I am defending,
is a reminder that poetry is not only universal, everywhere, democratic,
untapped, available, un-elitist, beautiful, unplanned, etc. -

it is also, as the greatest poets will tell you - elusive, unexplainable,
profound, high, great, deep, overwhelming, shattering, work of a lifetime,
work of genius, unique, rare, precious, inimitable.  GET IT???? A GIFT.

Pleasure in writing, happiness in writing are one thing.  Poetry, on the
other hand, ... well, it's like Life, or Love.  Don't bowdlerize &
industrialize it. Don't idolatrize it.  Respect it for what it is -
something unknown.

the idol of America is PRODUCTION.  But poetry, among all the other things
mentioned, is also the benchmark.  The UNATTAINABLE.  Listen...

Roof Books published Hannah's last book: _We Speak Silent_ in 1996. Hannah
had been ill off and on for a few years, but no one expected her death.
She came to a reading of mine as recently as May 1997 and was vigorous if
distracted. She was a wonder and a trial to me for 20 years. I will miss
her very much.

If any of you are interested in _We Speak Silent_ please let me know.

In the Italian film "The Postman", hashed over here several months ago, one
(Neruda) lives for poetry, another (the postman) literally dies for poetry.
Poetry is Olson's father.  Poetry is the overturning of the present by
the future, the stumbling fox after the turtle (dove).  Diana, Teresa,
pure poetry of the next millenium, floating into the end of the LAST
century.  Poetry more than anything is a black stone on a white stone.
Communism - the poetry of injustice.  Christianity - the poetry of
Judaism.  Judaism - the poetry of justice.  Justice - the poetry of
reality.  Reality - the poetry of communism.  Soviet ideology - technique.

Harry Partch, Robert Ashley, Meredith Monk &&&.

5. _Ghostlier Demarcations: Modern Poetry and the Material Word_, Michael
Davidson, U. Cal., $35 hc. Michael Davidson argues that the modernist
ideology of the work of art as autonomous object has dominated our idea of
literary materiality and hindered our ability to to read poetry as a socially
critical medium. "The relation of material word to material world in all its
ideological complexties is Davidson's subject. The book thus has a double
value: it provides us with a host of genuinely new readings-- of Gertrude
Stein and Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen and Susan Howe, Muriel Rukeyser and
Laurie Anderson-- but it also provides us with theoretical and cultural tools
whereby recent verbal experiments-- whether graphemic, morphemic, or
genetic-- may be understood. A terrific accomplishment!" --Marjorie Perloff.

6. _Guy Debord -- Revolutionary: A Critical Biography_, Len Bracken, Feral
House, $14.95. A book much better than most. "Who has made, in so few images,
a more beautiful poem of solitude?" --G.D.

7. _Politics of Friendship_, Jacques Derrida, Verso, $20. The 'political
turn' many noted in Derrida's _Spectres of Marx_ continues here in an

including the remarkable "History of the Jewish Socialist Party in America."

10. _Some of the Dharma_, Jack Kerouac, Viking, $32.50. Beautifully typeset
large format hardcover of Kerouac's buddhist journals/poems/proses. The
typesetting puts one in mind of The Maximus Poems or the recent U Cal
Mallarme-- ok, not quite that good-- but shockingly good for a major trade
publication. & Kerouac, y'know, he's a pretty good writer.

11. _Continuous Discontinuous_, Andrew Levy, Potes & Poets, $13.50. "The four
forceful, lovely works collected here, though very different from each other,
all represent profound and yet quickly changing encounters with sense and

Hejinian.

well, yeah!  this is hardly a novel argument, tho it is refreshing to see
it here on poetix and to see the range of writers (usually bracketed off as
"difficult" i.e. not "socially engaged" or "relevant") Michael D takes on.

Subject:      Writing experiments
Content-Type: text/plain

Warning:2 writing experitments to follow!

Thanks to all that posted suggestions for writing experiments-- as
promised I will share a couple of mine-- and respond to the thread of
"to what greatness" (my paraphrase) so writing excercise contribute.

I teach a workshop at a cultural center (alas, no big dough here so
there goes the theory about creative writing = money for something you
sell)-- I do hope that I allow in my class is some time and space to
practice writing.  I work another job to support myself as a writer--
often my writing class is a useful space for me to create poems,
sometimes it is the only place I can actually write.  Great ones?  I
sometimes find my writing great, sometimes its stays where it should,
hidden, and sometimes it yields a line or thought or memory which
becomes something else later (GREAT!).

This I wrote from an in-class exercise-- pretty ordinary exercise
really-- we made collages from magazines with images and text-- then we
traded them and wrote using them as a kind of trigger:


Stupid, Meatloaf

Stare at a toy plane    10:10 PM        and the Wizard
behind the screen is a rented man       my heart
(organ) burns, it does          like the 9 of spades
found in an empty parking lot   apart
--  when did one find the stark differences
of crotches?  --  the rented man of my heart &
if I hate my job or hurt hand   the wizard
will get me a new heart, Tin Man, maybe
dirt cheap      maybe   a toy plane to stare
at in high beams        in the rain     Nothing up
my sleeve but the 9 of spades and my heart
(organ) burns finding the stark difference
in the Tin Man          and the dirt cheap boom boom
sound of 10:10    before someone comes home

I like this poem-- and it goes with what Finnegan had said about the
need to read -- well that is obvious-- and of course the need for
writing practice.  This ended up as a sonnet -- a form I have used quite
a bit-- and a form that I have read in Ted Berrigan and Bernadette
Meyers' works.

Ok here is another more complicated approach adapted from Harryette
Mullen from OULIPO:

Take a word, preferably (for ease) with five or less letters, and not
too many repeating letters, for example, star.  Then generate a lexicon
of words that are somewhat and not at all associative to the word,
_without_ using the letters that make up that word. (the letters s, t,
a, or r in our example so: dim, model, cool, flip, dumb.. and so on) You
should collect about 15 words.  Now throw away the "letter" constraint
and write using the words in the list.

A twist I used in this class was to compose the work as a "letter", as
in-- Dear Star:..etc.  Here are two I wrote like these.  (I wrote a few
like these!)


Dear Death

A simple quibble —  what is it that you prize?  Pride?
Your winsome vibe aside —  we sniff hard at the ruse
of the mondo-young.  Whip the moon to a nub
and we would have you new.  Human remains
ruined and I am, wishing for a rune-tattoo to follow.



Dear Talk

Why mop nonsense into a bomb bigger
than speech?  You are all, Talk, a dizzy
no-no, a misunderstood gift like gin.  Why
do you croon to me like sunshine, and why
does red sift sky like an engine of words,
as an engine for fighting wonder.  I will
be gossip for you to surpass.

....I honestly don't see any sides (or argument) to this.  You obviously
have a point to make about quaility, the "gift" of poetry, and writing
experiments, but I am not sure what that is.  It seems to me that it
isn't so much experiments with writing in themselves that may be taken
to issue, but their over reliance and/or eclipsing of the practice of
reading and listening.  But I think that this has been said more
eloquently by others on this list, so I will stop here.

i know this topic has been taken around the block
several times, but what about the 'poems/directions'
in yoko ono's 'clouds'?---these are experiments,
some in writing---they are writing experiments in
that she 'wrote' them and a reader/experimenter can
read or fulfill them---what sort of fulfillment did ono
intend in these pages?---

Henry,

Yes, I've hung back. Let others have their say: Writing
exercises are freeing, occasionally yeild brilliancies.

I think, mostly, it's a matter of temperament. I cringe
at the idea of writing a poem that I have no vested interest
in writing, no will to write on mine own accord.

I say more sweat; I want to see your struggle. I don't want

James,

This sure sounds like a flight of fancy to me.
And doesn't "fancy" in this sense mean the imagination, anyway? Yes,
I do want to see that. And I think we see it as much in the choices,
structural, method, and otherwise, as we see it in diction, form,
field of poem, etc.

Seems there is some idea here that a poem wrought by a method or
procedure can't be as sincere or close to the bone or _____________
(anything) as one which is not wrought by such method or procedure. I
don't agree with that at all. Also seems like there's an idea that
there is some stance which is entirely naked, sweaty, struggling, and
devoid of any method or procedure -- no, I don't agree with that,
either.

Just wanted to make a plug for the magazine I co-edit, JackLeg.

ISSUE #3, FALL 1997

Featured writers include:

 Ray Gonzalez    Alison Deming       James McManus
 Luis Rodriguez  Mark Turcotte       Denise Duhamel
 Calvin Forbes   Maureen Seaton      Reginald Gibbons
 Barry Silesky   Mary Hawley         Jon Anderson
 Gale Walden     Daniel Tobin        Simone Muench
 Becky Byrkit    Charles Alexander   Gregg Wagner
 Lisa Cooper     Bill Marsh   and    Thomas Chandler

Please join us for Issue #3's DEBUT READING at:

The Guild Complex at the Chopin Theater
1543 W. Division Street, (corner of Ashland, Milwaukee, and Division)
in CHICAGO

OCTOBER 21, 1997 AT 7:30 P.M.


JackLeg is a community based literary magazine, primarily featuring writers
from Chicago and Tucson (now that I've moved to San Francisco, we'll start
adding Bay Area writers to the mix for issue #4).  As with our previous two
issues, JackLeg is held together with nuts and bolts, so that when one is
through reading it one can do minor home repairs or put somebody's eye out
(you can even add your own poems, or remove the ones you don't like, and
hardly anyone will know).

A Jackleg is someone who talks too much about something she or he knows
nothing about.

While I'm reluctant to prolong this discussion, and given that David Bromige
has succinctly outlined the value of writing exercises in his posting a
couple of days ago, there are still a couple of things I'd like to add.
First, to gesture broadly toward the long and illustrious history of writing
which owes its existence to procedure(s) and/or methods of constraint (Homer
was no stranger to the lipogram, after all), and, second, to mention the
works of one writer who, this century at least, demonstrates beyond doubt
the validity of such methods: Georges Perec.  Any discussion of Perec has to
involve a wider consideration of the benefits (the "freeing-up") of writing
exercises, for Perec felt that his own story, the story he might one day
tell given his great ambition to be a writer, had been taken brutally from
him by the events of WWII, his childhood spent in exile and the loss of
his family to the Nazis.  Yes, his first works were written with no specific
or systematic artifice, but it was surely the strange texture of the first
novel, _Things_, with its collaged borrowings from Flaubert, that persuaded
Raymond Queneau to put Perec forward for membership of the OuLiPo, and it
would be difficult indeed to dismiss the works Perec then went on to
write--using greater and more elaborate formal systems--as mere "exercises".
 It is interesting, though, that for many years the OuLiPo itself was wary
of the (potential) importance of its work, and met for some years in secret,
publishing little.  It was Queneau's death in the late seventies which
prompted Perec to start work on _Life A User's Manual_, in which a network
of quotations from his beloved authors (Roussel, Kafka, Melville, Proust,
Sterne, Leiris...) sits within a formal structure of highly complex design
(the expanded, 10x10 chessboard, the Knight's Tour, the Graeco-Latin
bisquare of order 10, &&)--extraordinary, really, that the book should
stilll be such a page-turner!  And the lipogrammatic novel _La Disparition_
also allows those of us with not exactly fluent French to marvel at the
superb translation (_A Void_) by Gilbert Adair.  And what an idea, a
whodunnit written entirely without the letter e, in which the murderer turns
out to be the errant vowel!  The wider point here is, of course, that these
and other works cannot be separated from the systems which helped to
generate them--the "plot" of _La Disparition_, for example, was to an extent
shaped by the reduced lexicon (e being by far the most common letter in the
language) that Perec had available.  Perec inscribed his biography into
these processual works in complex and fascinating ways, and the results were
not only deeply moving but sometimes shocking (_W or The Memory of
Childhood_).

There has already been discussion on this list of the flexibility of
self-imposed rules--that one can depart or diverge from them once they have
provided something interesting, and that such departures do not necessarily
undermine the overall system (for Perec this would be Epicurus's "clinamen",
the anti-constraint that operates within the structure [or Paul Klee's
"genius is the error in the system"]), and this flexibility is a nice
counterpoint to the practice of setting up a system and following it
pedantically to its conclusion (Happy Birthday, Jackson!).

As Charles Bernstein pointed out some time ago now in "Thought's Measure",
the writer who sits, pen in hand, alone with her thoughts, invariably
produces writing which is far from unique.  To admit begrudgingly to the use
of "exercises" in the classroom but to remain scornful of their uses
elsewhere is to demonstrate remarkably little understanding of how many
writers
actually construct their work.

I agree with you.  I also think the interesting writing comes out of either
long gestation - or intense experience.  It seems patronizing
to me to reduce it to a game.  Or only a game, though it's that too I guess.
Encourage people to draw on their experience, their reading, & their
social consciousness - give them "themes" rather than scissors & paste
(or along with the scissors & paste...)  - Henry

O.k. Miles the Champion, you've brought in Perec & Borges & all that &
clearly checkmated the counter-argument.  Yes, "exercises" can bring a
breath of fresh air & liberation & play into the writing process as well
as point in the direction of serious craft. On the other hand, to be
"scornful" of the writer who sits pen in hand etc. is just as reductive.
I still say technique for its own sake has become a contemporary
shibboleth, especially in the "experimental" community; & IF I WERE
THE IDEAL WRITING TEACHER I would want to listen carefully to the students
& find out what they'd read, would put on some tapes of poets new
& traditional (Beowulf is still available in live performance), would
encourage an exploration of history & social consciousness in writing,
before introducing facile techniques.  Because you never know, there might
actually be a few writers in your class.  - Henry Gould

thanks miles for this informative post; as someone attracted to both
"language"-centered writing and also the exigencies of traumatic
biographical "reality," i find this kind of insight invaluable.

fresh air, liberation and play _is_ the writing process (for me anyway).
It's also the reading process.

I use exercises in my writing classes--I also ask what poetry the students
read.  A surprising number of them read very little (this is an undergrad
class, and many take it for elective credit).  I see plenty of thoughtless
form, sentimental content, etc.  Exercises are a way to break out of that,
as is reading. Etc etc.

mention of Oulipo reminds me to mention a newish book i picked
up last week in toronto: _Oulipo Laboratoy_ (Atlas Press, London
1995) featuring works by Queneau, Calvino, Fournel, Berge, Jouet
& Mathews...  important stuff that i think can legitimatly claim
to be "experimental", so the title seems approp...  glad to have
another source, beyond the U. of Nebraska anthology, and more is
promised.

& while i'm here: several years ago, i was stuck w/ what seemed
like a promising fragment... & set myself the task of recycling
the vocabulary from that poempart to complete th poem... i liked
the results quite a bit--th puzzle of reusing each of the original
words in new arrangements forced me to refocus on the language
material rather than my ideas or emotions or whatever, and the
echoing/repetions added some sonic interest, i thot.  you could
base an excersize on that, i think, & praps students wd learn
something by confronting those processes & concerns--that cd be
of use, whether or no the resulting "poems" were any "good"...
i kinda meant to go back and try that technique again mself, but
never got around to it... but at what point would that become
gimmimimicry?(thanx fr that word, henry!)  when the results were
no longer interesting?  or when the writer no longer learned
anything frm the excercize?

This has all been very interesting, and as pointed out along the way both
sides are almost in agreement anyway. I note Marjorie Perloff's _Radical
Artifice_ (among others) as pointing to the fact that sometimes setting up
formal 'limitations' is a means by which to get into the poem. I feel good
about some of the 'homolinguistic translations' which, as Bernstein & Meyer
point ou, comes from bpNichol & others, because the way in which I had to
think about formal constraints lead me out of the prisonhouse of lyric
egotism. For that alone, they've been worthwhile. For some at least.

Certainly for David B just on the list recently. But what do we call all
the work with his 'speaking figures' that  Alan Jen Sondheim has been
doing: who or what arew Julu & Jennifer if not formal constraints by any
other name? So I agree with Henry on the one hand but have found that I can
find my way toward connections with that history of poetry he seeks through
such 'work,'

Then there's what I do think is a great poem, Ronald Johnson's _Radi Os_,
the whole thing what I would call a form of 'homolinguistic translation' of
the first four books of _Paradise Lost_ (not to mention a lot of what
happens throughout _Arc_). If this be writing experimentation, let me at
it.

Me too.  Getting out of self-delusion, easy tricks, etc. ain't easy.  Some
kind of formal something (method, procedure, constraint, etc.) can be a
huge help, get you a lot closer to the bone.

Yes.  On the intersection of writing/reading process/praxis
(and to bring the thread back to its original question) a
good source to introduce to a (primarily undergrad?) work-
shop class would be Padgett's _Creative Reading_, which
organizes & discuses reading/writing 'exercises' both old
and new (at least new to me) in his own fun informative way.

or rather (w/ nod to Shklovsky)

I sent a reply to Judy Roitman, but you will have to post to poetics since
I cannot post there.

Here are the instructions for turning off the sound:

If you are using Netscape or Internet explorer, then what you should have
on the screen is a small box which is labeled "Crescendo." There are
several buttons on that box.  One of  the buttons near the right end of the
box has a small square on it.  This button, when clicked, shuts off the music.

If you cannot do that, there is also a small red dot in the box, which is
on a line above the buttons.  If you right click on that red dot, and drag
it to the left, the volume of the sound will go down.  Thus you may shut
the sound down to nothing, if you wish.

If either of these options does not work, please let us know.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

A few critics have dismissed my poems as not being poems and have dismissed
me as not being a poet. But one principle of criticism has it that only true
poets can recognize poetic creativity or function as critics of poetry --
and that the only true poets are those whose work conveys genuine poetic
creativity. But I have read the work of these critics; none of it
demonstrated poetic creativity. These critics' judgements should be
rejected, since these critics are not true poets

The argument above is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it

(A) Presupposes what it sets out to conclude, since the principle requires
that only true poets can determine whether the critics' work demonstrates
creativity

(B) uses the distinction between poets and critics as though everyone fell
into one category or the other

(C) gives no justification for the implicit claim that the standing of a
poet can be judged

(D) makes an unjustifiable distinction, since it is possible that some
critics are also poets

(E) inevitably leads to the conclusion that poets can never learn to improve
their poetry, since no poet is in a position to criticize his or her own work

No doubt exercises or self-imposed (self-invented?) formal constraints are
sometimes useful. It should also be obvious that sometimes a writer sitting
alone with her thoughts can produce unique writing. To assert the opposite
is on the face of it not only provocative, but absurd, and I hope you
misparaphrase. Or was Emily Dickenson doing calisthenics while she composed?

Dickinson, as we know her, never sat alone with her thoughts.  The sounds
and restraints of the hymn stanza were her calisthenics--an exercise to
isolate certain muscles (or rhythms) and promote the creation of beauty.

Why anyone has to quote Bernstein for this puzzles me. This is surely a
critical cliche.  Auden and any number of poets likely detested by many
on this List have uttered similar apothegms.  The serious disagreement
concerns the originality or radicalness of the restraint, not its presence.

Likewise, it makes me queasy to assume that Auden is detested by many on
this List -- hard to imagine that he would make anybody uneasy, or angry!
at this late date, and harder to imagine that he wouldn't be seen as a
genial forebear of Ashbery, and O'Hara, and Schuyler, and Koch?...

Subject:      a little poem

Chronos - Eater of Children

Do not sing the path of greatness,
For it was writ by the large to seduce the small,
What elevates the song, the word that moves
 beyond the "petty" thoughts of self-annoyance,
was writ by those that eat the small.

That which does not move beyond itself,
"Transcend," so they say, so they say
may be very good, so they say; But,
But, But But But But But,
"Only that which reaches beyond itself,
makes the extra gesture," to what?
To praise the eater of children,
who die starving at the banquets
of "Just Say No",
whose gods are manufactured
to just say this, and no more?

Jennifer's Ponder


"Such moments of these, like the falling of peas, take us away / From the
norm!"

Jennifer ponders: "Such moments _of_ these" (her emphasis)? Moments of
what, perhaps, what came before in the poem? Mead, storm, and ruins and
some other stuff, perhaps the drops of blood, there was an implication of
a castle, certainly a fortress, god knows what else. Not to mention (why
not?) the arthropods ...

But then, hmmm ...

"Such moments _like_ these, _like_ the falling of peas" does seem to over-
do it, these moments don't have to double up, quite, but they do! Hee hee!

So she considers "take us away from the norm!" might absorb (like her pan-
ties in a puddle!) the grammar that came before, just a bit off-putting.

And lets it alone, but wanted you to know this all along ...

ATTACK on CRAZY JANE TALKS WITH THE BISHOP by WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS


What an idiot Bishop! I met the Bishop on the road He should be in church!
Shut him up, evil church! And much said he and I. He talks too much!
Guilty of ageism! 'Those breasts are flat and fallen now, Sexless Bishop!
Just for children, eh! Those veins must soon be dry; Stop looking!
Sure he didn't say that! Live in a heavenly mansion, Where he gropes you!
Liar, liar, you wouldn't know! Not in some foul sty.' Beauty, beauty!

True, but shut him up! 'Fair and foul are near of kin, Yeats is also foul!
The poet's in love! And fair needs foul,' I cried. Liar! He denies it!
Oh yeah, shut up Yeats! 'My friends are gone, but that's a truth (Lie!)
Depression and love, eh? Nor grave nor bed denied, Forget Donne, Yeats!
Idiot! Raise the body! Learned in bodily lowliness Don't screw with it!
Give her your heart! And in the heart's pride. Why not! She struggled!

Yeah, don't generalize! 'A woman can be proud and stiff Written by a man!
Men need women more than women need men! When on love intent; Admit it!
Back to the mansion again! But Love has pitched his mansion in Anal sex!
So what! The place of excrement; You can't face it, Yeats, can you?
What about the Man! For nothing can be sole or whole He's broken in two!
More parts, three! That has not been rent.' Liar, broken Man, idiot!

Alan dinero of Taverner's Koans invited me to try out his new 'emergency'
forum system at his new cite. It's a Nicenet offering which promotes itself
as an 'online classroom' format. The resulting test turns out to be a much
better poem_de_terre, than the original test data. In addition, the poem
within the poem _Symphony_ which was pasted in to test the frame input
capacity turns out far better than the original which was nicely indented
and line broken to exagerate the voices. Once pasted -  Nicenet input frame
obligingly demolished all the indents and spacing and provided its own far
more successful version - the exercise writes the poem and the classroom is
the reality of exercise. If you don't like it, complain.

I tend to agree with both sides in this debate, that exercises are useful
and can lead to good or even great poems, and that poetry at heart is
mysterious, without recipes, maps or a decent set of directions, driven by
intuition, wisdom, and sweat.

But amidst the handwringing, I'd like to point that poetry is also, well,
fun, and that a poem can be pleasurable no matter what its origins.

Is  Auden detested by many on this list?  At times, I don't know what

Announcing publication of

_Nothing Happened and Besides I Wasn't There_
by Mark Wallace

If Mark Wallace did the comedy circuit, all that big hair and those sweet
drinks would riot in the streets. _Nothing Happened and Besides I Wasn't
There_ is a series of one to six line stanzas all revamping the idea of the
one-liner. But the joke is always frightening, a world where the 2x4s
pounding the cat are hitting our heads and they hurt damn it, as they always
make us stop and consider what we are. He is the existential joker: if Batman
met the poet and it was for real.
--Juliana Spahr

Mark Wallace's poetry is joyous, gloomy, frisky, reflective and vulnerable to
a sense of the living world that he never tried to master, but to inhabit as
a kind of sad old citizen, a belonger filled with longing. He loves the daily
tunes, the ring of contemporary coinage, flashes of wry and sardonic humor,
the lover's chagrin-- for the sake of the human conditions they are
immediacies of, but it is a music of heaven and hell he listens for in it
all. The structure of identity is exploded in the form of a three-dimensional
literary method in which the borders of personality, of self and nonself, are
simultaneous and conflicting modes of expression. Sometimes he takes off like
a reasonable lecturer who suddenly becomes demented. He speaks great truths
as casually as if they were lies.
--Ron Silliman

This amazing deflection of repetitive aphorisms swirls and spirals in upon
itself, fueled by the delusory aggrandizements of the insidious institutions
we call contemporary existence. Wallace manages to capture what it's like to
find oneself all dressed up with no place to go. This is no book for the
squeamish.
Buy it if you have nothing better to do. You don't.
--Joe Ross

WARNING: The Surgeon General has determined that reading _Nothing Happened

Can't speak for anyone else, but I'm very keen on the early Auden,
always have been.  And he has some very strange & radical poetry -- The
Orators, had it been written in 1990 and not 1930, could have been
published by Sun & Moon.  The problem many people have with Auden is
that his most interesting work isn't his best known, at least not in
America.  He'd written most of the poetry I really care about in the
Auden canon before he came to this country in 1940.  But the young Auden
was radical in form and in politics, engage, and witty into the bargain.

But somewhere always, nowhere particularly unusual,
Almost anywhere in the landscape of water and houses,
His crying competing unsuccessfully with the cry
Of the traffic or the birds, is always standing
The one who needs you, that terrified
Imaginative child who only knows you
As what the uncles call a lie,
But knows he has to be the future and that only
The meek inherit the earth, and is neither
Charming, successful, nor a crowd;
Alone among the noise and policies of summer,
His weeping climbs toward your life like a vocation.

- Auden, "Like a Vocation"

In today's NYT Times, there is a highly uninformative piece called "The
Howl of a Poet and Hist Generation" on some PBS special American Masters:
The Life and Times of Allen Ginsberg (sounds like a criminal).  Anyway,
Gisberg is quoted as sayng, towards the end of his life (or that tv show),
"I had my chance and lost it."  Does anybody know the context of that
remark? Is AG looking back on his poetic career as a failed project, or
somethiing that swerved towards market banality or more devious forms of
corruption. It seems a hard remark, full of pathos of a failed agon. Did
he dfeel like it was all downhill from Howl to Randowm House jottings?

Re: Rob Wilson's question: That remark of Allen's is actually from a poem,
the one that ends "Allen Ginsberg says don't follow my path to extinction."
[i think it's called "After Lalon"?].  It must be in White Shroud.
There's definitely a buddhist undertone to the statement "I had my chance
and lost it", re: impermanence.  It's actually kind of funny in that way.
But also, i think it functions not as a comment on his own career (which i
think he was pretty satisfied with) but as a comment on his role as a
spokesperson, looking at the political and saying that in retrospect things
could've been different.  (even in terms of the route the left wing took
toward the end of the 1960s).  (which is also something that he talks about
in the life and times video).  lisa jarnot

The line is in a poem whose name I don't recall, but it's on the fourth CD in the
box set called Holy Soul Jelly Roll (I believe).  The specific context is
ambiguous and teasing -- Ginsberg does not spell out what he means -- his
life as a port, his life as a man -- could be everything -- but the line is delivered
with stunning conviction ... as well as humor.

that line is from a poem called "After Lalon" and it is a funny/sad sort
of retrospective of some of his life. there's a wonderful recording of it
on "holy soul jelly roll" too.

Auden lovers and loathers alike might be (at least slightly) amused by
"Four Poems and a Funeral," a Christopher Hitchens piece, at:

http://www.salonmagazine.com:80/sept97/news/news970911.html

Included is this perfectly awful bit of a Ted Hughes poem about the
Queen Mum, which begins:

    It was an eerie vision! The Land of the Lion!
    Each clear creature, crystal bright,
    Honey-lit with lion-light,
    All dreaming together the Dream of the Lion.

And ends:

    A Queen's life is hard. Yet a Queen reigns
    Over the dream of her people, or nowhere.

Rule Britannia!

Rachel, except for the hackneyed b/b rhyme, are you quite positive this
isn't late Ginsberg? No, he wouldn't have used "eerie." And all of this
would have been run up in one line. Never mind.

Rachel--
that Hughes piece is indeed dreadful!  Ted seems to be following in the
footsteps of such other outstanding poet laureates as Nahum Tate and
company.  Does anyone know any books or articles on the effects of
official laureatehood on poets' work?  Richard Helgerson's _Self-Crowned
Laureates_ is great on Jonson, Spenser, & Milton, but his point is
precisely that they seized or assumed a laureate-like position themselves;
something creepy seems to happen when a poet gets officially appointed.

Few poets laureate have been the best of their generation--most, in fact,
have been more like Tate or Prior, in a word, hacks. So they didn't have
far to fall. And Wordsworth had lost the flame long before he got the royal
nod. Dryden, on the other hand, did almost all his best work while in office.
Hughes probably does better work after hours, but he's never been such a
much himself.

yes, strangely counterpoised to post-nobels, supreme court appointments and
other high-rollers casting ballast and rising into the statusphere and
outta sight. Perhaps the laureate balloons already had too much gas?

Hmm, I do think there may be a wisp of AG's ghost wherever exclamation
points wax ecstatic, but what I keep hearing, unfortunately, is "A
Queen's life is hard" set to music, something like Gilbert & Sullivan's
"A Policeman's Lot is Not a Happy One."

The most amazing Oulipo resource I know of is a *THREE VOLUME* _La
Bibliotheque Oulipienne_ [apologies for omitted accents ...]. The publisher
is Seghers, I'm showing an ISBN of 2-232-10308-0 for volume 1.  This is in
French, of course.  For anyone truly interested in Oulipo, these volumes are
a must-have.  I'm not sure where one orders such things, I just found them
sitting on the shelf the last time I was at a bookstore in Paris.
(Amazon.com doesn't seem to have them; I just tried that ISBN at Amazon.com
and came up empty.)  Pierre?

to Kyle Gann's memorial to Conlon Nancarrow, published the preceding week.
In answer to MacLow's question, Gann reports that Nancarrow was a friend of
George Oppen's in Mexico -- There's a friendship I'd like to read more
about -- Anybody have any info.?

2.  Same issue includes notice of a new Lou Harrison CD that includes

Dear List,

A student recently returned from a summer in Poland. He is on fire
to read/know (fairly) contemporary Polish poetry/Polish poets.

Other than the Nobel obvious, I confess ignorance. What's available
in translation becomes crucial. Who/what do you recommend that's
translated into either English or German?

I'm not really aware of this friendship, although it's certainly not
surprising. Is there any references that one could offer? There's nothing I
recall in Mary Oppen's book about Nancarrow, although the years in exile
aren't broached in too much depth there. I've found nothing (yet) in the
working papers that suggests a freindship with or otherwise mentions
Nancarrow, although it's fairly safe to say that the majority of Oppen's
papers were produced after his return to the states (there are a few pages
w/ Oppen's address in Mexico at the top, but even these provide little
certainty re: dating or location, as it appears that he often used a given
page as a kind of worksheet for thought, which he would return to, revise,
etc. over often a period of years).

As for Oppen & Mexico: Oppen's leaving Mexico and returning to poetry and
to the States had very much to do with a kind of political dissatisfaction.
As he puts it in the interview with Burt Hatlen and Tom Mandel: "Rome had
recently burned, so there was no reason not to fiddle." Obviously, the
party at that point offered little room for the kind of thing Oppen was
concerned with in poetry, and he was very careful to keep the two
relatively seperate. I'd be hesitant, however, to say that Oppen wanted to
put everything in Mexico behind him. He does in the papers refer to some
acquaintances and/or experiences from that period, and that he returned
after-the-fact to some of his jottings from Mexico (they aren't really
poems) suggests a desire to come to terms with that moment.

I think Oppen's relative reticence about those years, in any case, had
mostly to do with what he saw as their irrelevance to his poetry. His
fondness for quoting Kenner's observation that it essentially took him "25
years to write the next poem" suggests that he saw some validity in the
statement. He simply wasn't writing poetry, and so perhaps didn't see those
years as essential to his development as a poet.

On this latter, Tom Mandel might have some to say (see his letter in
follwing the Hatlen/Mandel interview in "Man and Poet").

OK, apologies for being a bit off topic...

Stephen,

Rachel would know much more about all this than I do. But. George and Mary
used to speak of Nancarrow as a friend (whereas, Fred Cody, who founded the
bookstore in Berkeley, was simply a guy they shared a ride with as they
returned to the US from Mexico City).

Mary once told me that they left for Mexico as a direct result (and perhaps
the same week as) the arrest of the Rosenbergs. George was not able to
return to the US, as I understand it, until his sister June was able to
clear it with the state department that they would not be arrested on their
return. June was a major political donor for many decades, one of the major
contributors to Mondale, for example. (All this has a very different tone
these days of course. And June was a connected Democrat who got this done
during a Republican presidency.)

I very much got the impression that neither George or Mary particularly
cared for Mexico City, certainly never thought of it as home, and very much
had a sense of "exile" the entire time they were there.

Ron

There is a brief mention in the biographical section of Gann's very good
(and probably not too technical for non-musicians) book on Nancarrow's
music of Oppen supplying composer/radio producer Charles Amirkhanian with
Nancarrow's telephone number but that's it.

I cant' find my copy right now, but I'm pretty sure that I would have
noticed a mention of Nancarrow in Mary Oppen's memoir.

Nancarrow and the Oppens certainly shared similar politics (Nancarrow left
the States for Mexico after fighting in the Abraham Lincoln Brigades during
the Spanish Civil War - he couldn't get a passport and was concerned about
his leftist leanings causing trouble if he stayed in the US).

Nancarrow was pretty private about most things, I doubt there'll be more
published on this from the music world, but I'll check with Kyle & see if
he has any other info.

Yeah, & they call DeLillo something like the greatest living writer of
sentences.

If I hadn't read the headline, I'd have thought the complete Alphabet had
been published without Ron announcing it to the poetics list.

I don't know if this information is useful to scholars/poets, but  sometime
in the late eighties, after George died, I was visiting Mary Oppen in
Berkeley (actually Albany), and we had lunch with Nancarrow and his wife who
had come back to scout out a school for a child of theirs, a daughter I
believe.  The memory is a bit hazy, and my notes on the visit are buried
somewhere.

At the time, I had neither heard of him or his music, and later, after our
lunch, Mary played some of his extraordinary music for me.

Mime-Version: 1.0

As always, I await some other Seattleite to start giving fashion reports,
attendance records, etc. on the reading scene in Seattle (for that matter
what happened to Steven Carll's often entertaining or informative reports
on SF readings), but I do want to briefly say that Subtext's Thursday
reading was really great.  David Bromige & Robin Blaser were in fine form,
David reading all previously unpublished (in paper form, at least, one or
two pieces having been posted to this here list) work & Robin read recent
work as well as from the new Dante piece.

I was wondering, though, and thought to bring it up to this august group,
does anyone know if there's any truth to the rumor I overheard this weekend
that Wallace Stevens did NOT write the poems published under his name..
That, rather, his wife wrote them, and that was one of the reasons why
guests at the Stevens' home were never introduced to her?

Any feminist critics that have any insights on this?  Is Peter Quartermain
still reading the list?

For that matter, when I was up in Vancouver a week ago or so, I didn't look
at the vile-sounding "reader's edition" of Joyce's Ulysses, those it was
prominently displayed in the window of Duthie's downtown.  This book won't
be available in the US til some time in 1998.  Could some Canadian (is it
available in the UK yet?) confirm (or deny) that this text does not end
with "Yes I said Yes I will Yes" but rather adds the words "said Molly
before turning over and falling into a dreamless sleep."

Just thought I should check on these things.  Not being an active part of
an academic community, I sometimes miss out on the current research til
it's on NPR or something.

Bests,

The Sept. 25 issue of New York Review has an article about this Ulysses.
although taken to task on a number of other emendations, nowhere is
mention made of the instance you cite above. Hard to figure out what Danis
Rose was up to in his "reader's edition" with some of his changes, but
then I'm always suspicious of what the NYR has to say. John Kidd, the
author of the review, is founding director of the James Joyce Research
Centre at Boston Univ. I'm no Joyce scholar, so I don't know if he's
nitpicking, adverse to new "readings," or right on the mark. I'm a big
help, aren't I?

best,
Steven

everything i hear about the new "reader's edition" of the joyce is

Dear subscribers,

I know that Stein's famous line "Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" first
appeared in "Sacred Emily" (1913) and cropped up in later works as well.
Unfortunately, I have no easy way to scan through my Stein books for the
later uses of the line & would like to be able to get to them more easily.
I would be grateful if anyone knows offhand (without troubling to
search, that is) which works contain it, apart from _The World Is Round_,
of which I am already aware. I am interested not just in uses of the line
in literary texts, but in Stein's own explications of it in lectures and
essays or either of the autobiographys.  (I am aware of her discussions in
_Lectures in America_ and _Narration_, so I don't need those references.)
Editions & page numbers, or even approximate locations within chapters
would be extremely useful.

Also, I remember seeing reproduced in some edition either of Stein's work
or about her a graphic image of the rose around which the line made a
circle.  I think this was something she had printed up for stationery.  If
anyone knows of any text where I could find this image, I'd be grateful
for that as well. Please copy any replies to me via backchannel.  Many
thanks in advance.

such an allegation, if true, would make small fry of recent
unplesantnesses in the plagarism department, seems.

Had certainly never heard of this -- but maybe I'd be the last to
know.  The idea, anyway, finds nice resonance in the plot of
Kieslawski's film BLUE (in which a famous modernist-ish [well,
neo-romantic] composer's work was, evidently, done by his wife -- or
at least that's one reading of the story).

I'll admit to considerable scepticism re: this scandalous rumor; but
whether or not it were true anent Wally, I a little bit wonder how
well known -- and for how long -- this has been extant qua rumor.
Even wonder if Kieslawski's plot were possibly based on the Stevens
scandal as such (if such it be ???).

await further word from the wise,
d.i.

Subject:      Oppen's years away
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

SC writes that...

"Oppen's ...fondness for quoting Kenner's observation that it essentially
took him "25 years to write the next poem" suggests that he saw some validity
in the statement. He simply wasn't writing poetry, and so perhaps didn't see
those years as essential to his development as a poet."

I don't think either of these statements is correct, exactly. It's
my understanding (but am I write?) that Oppen was writing --
perhaps not much, but definitely writing -- tho not publishing.
And if you have no intention/prospect of publishing, why then
perhaps you do write less.

As to validity in Kenner's remark, lets first consider the remark:
to me it's a perfect example of a conservative sew-up of a radical rip,
and it's equally an example of 2d-order (i.e. critical) thinking.
Something happened, and Kenner's remark essentially makes that something
go away! Hagiography would be another rubric under which to range
the remark.

*My* interpretation of how this works (and given the above it has no
particular privilege over Kenner or the notion that Oppen found
"validity" in Kenner's words), my opinion is that Oppen was very
troubled by the 25 years during which he'd abandoned his vocation.
Especially was he troubled, because he wrote with such *effect*
when he returned to poetry, and stimulated response too.

I don't much remember the interview Burt and I did with George,
except that I asked him straightforwardly what it said about
poetry and his relation to it, and what it said *to* poetry,
that he'd left it aside all those years. To this he responded,
if I remember right, by quoting Kenner (on himself!). It was
not responsive.

It's *very* worth noting that Oppen was *not* in great shape mentally
by the time of this interview. There was an immediately sensible limit
to the attention he could give our questions. I knew George and Mary
pretty well for some years from the late seventies on. I well remember
Mary taking me aside to wish that I'd known George when he was himself.
Much of George's conversation was fascinating, and he was very alive
in the present tense. But attention to his own past often took the
conversation into an area of repeated remarks and stories.

His affirmation of Kenner's stitching should surely be seen in
that light too.

I did and still do think Oppen's decades away from poetry are
significant. I see no reason simply to explain them away. I'd
be more interested in what anybody thinks the relation might be
between that abandonment and the force of his return.

Speaking generally about a poet who might abandon and then return rather
than Oppen specifically: some poets work in bursts of activity followed by
long periods of quiet. Perhaps this is to fill up the well; perhaps
boredom; perhaps other interests; perhaps the demands of making a living;
perhaps illnesses; perhaps family problems and illnesses -- the list is,
of course, endless..

As for the force of return: exhiliration from new praxes. But this list is
endless, too.

in particular,
Steven

Bill:  you might want to look at Grace Paley's story "A Conversation
with My Father."  The story is a good example of reader-based writing-
Paley's narrator revises the story that she is telling several times
for the sake of the "audience"- that is, the "father" character of the story.
It's a great example of the work of revision, as well as an interesting way
to look at the idea of "audience."

You might want to include selections from Jack Spicer's _The Heads of
the Town up to the Aether_ and _After Lorca_, both in _The Collected
Books of Jack Spicer_, edited by Robin Blaser [Black Sparrow]. And from
_Writing from the New Coast: Technique_ [o*blek #12]. Many good, short
pieces in these sources.

herb levy,

i have not heard the rumour that stevens' wife wrote the poems
published under his name -- but it is far-fetched at best, according
to everything i have read about what people know of his composition
processes, conversations he had with people, etc.  another resonance
of the who-was-shakespeare issue, perhaps? -- or of credible cases in
which people central to a writer's productions were not acknowledged
in the published works.

Wallace Stevens wife modeled the figure of liberty which appears on the
obverse of a coin, I'm not sure if it was the pre roosevelt dime or what,
maybe the buffalo nickel.

Stevens also said something along the lines of "money is a kind of poetry."

but I always thought that it was John Ashbery who had written all of
Wallace Stevens' poetry.

Rod, two additions to the order I emailed in yesterday:

The Clash, by Walter LaFeber, Norton (history of US-Japan relations)

and,

I think there is supposed to be a collected short stories of Ward Just
(not The Congressman Who loved Flaubert but something later and more
extensive) -- if such exists, please add that to the order.

Maybe Herb was half-remembering that Mrs Wilson was really presidenting the
USA while Wilson was ill, or that that horrible skinny woman was running it
when Reagan was foirgetting stuff. And then naturally, confusing poets with
presidents (and who wouldnt?), mixed them up with Stevens. I am not
forgetting, me, no, that there is a chance that David Bromige wrote a lot
of the poems after Harmonium.

My message concerned Red Slider, and his request to me (via another list he
and I are on) to lend him support in his attempt to find reinstatement on
the Poetics List, from which he has been, in his own term, "86'd", for
causes he cannot determine. I care both because Red strikes me as a
likeable guy worth having with us, & also because I want to know what he
did or didnt do to earn a banishment I myself wish to avoid.

Because Red included the correspondence from the Buffalo end with his
message, I know that he was being told that, lacking further authentication
of either his name or his e-ddress,the Poetics List could not continue his
membership. I e-mailed the List e-ddress I had for such matters, & perhaps
will receive a human response eventually. Meanwhile, though, I forward this
one, because of the chilling, 1984-ish tone of the sentence in the
following para, the sentence which begins, "Naturally..." and contains the
info that if you write in about someone else's concerns with leaving the
List, you may well be eliminated from it yourself. So, if you dont hear
from me again, you'll leastwise know down which plughole I went.

Meanwhile, I await clarification of the murky Red Slider 86'd
issue--backchannel will do fine.

Although I'm not much of a Boswell, I thought I'd second Herb Levy's note
on how excellent this month's Subtext reading at the Speakeasy here in
Seattle was.  OK, a brief report...

The backroom of the Speakeasy Cafe in the Belltown district holds 50-60
people (or so I guess) and once again seemed at capacity this month.
Nowadays there's a stage set up one end of the room to accomodate the ever
more regular performances that take place there, theatrical and otherwise.
(In June there was a musical show on the Titanic in the middle of its run
on this stage. So when Leslie Scalapino read here during that month she
shared the stage with a few minor set pieces, little background paintings
of icebergs and the Doomed Ship, etc.)  Anyhow...

David Bromige was the first reader. This was highly entertaining, as many
of the listfolk here would suspect.  He opened with the amusing "T is for
Tethered," and followed up with a material from a longer sequence of new
work.  He also included a bit from the recent David B./David I. thread
here on POETICS.  As I recall, he was also sporting a pair of red-rimmed
glasses, which I had never seen the likes of before. I confess this is
probably the best I can do in the way of a fashion report on the event.

I was in conversation in my seat with a friend during the intermission, so
I did not have the usual chance to note more completely who was in
attendance, although the most of the usual attendees seemed to be there:
Herb Levy, Nico Vassilakis, John & Roberta Olson, Bryant Mason, Ezra Mark,
Priscilla Long, Reuben Radding.  Other folks usually in attendance that I
may have missed include Laynie Brown, Robert Mittenthal, and Steven
Shaviro. Plenty of other noteable and interesting folks as well, I'm sure,
whose faces I don't know yet.

Robin Blaser read during the second half largely from a longer piece
"Imagintion 14," although, as Herb mentioned, he included a segment from
an apparently very long piece on Dante he is working on.  Midway through
the reading the activity increased in the pool club directly upstairs.
This is a regular occurance.  As the second half of the evening progresses
the reading becomes punctuated by the occassional taps of cue sticks
emanating from the ceiling, along with the more dramatic bonk of billiard
ball and subsequently noisy roll.  Sometimes music from upstairs or the
Speakeasy frontroom starts to creep in on the proceedings.  Thankfully,
these nagging phenomena weren't as pronounced as they have been in some
past months. The man I was talking with during the intermission had
studied under Blaser at Simon Fraser University and had commented to me
that Blaser had the sort of voice that could make a reading out of a
phonebook fascinating.  Indeed his reading seemed to confirm this.  The
man exudes charm.

That's the basics of the evening.  A dozen or so folks, myself included,
also had the chance to take part in two workshop sessions with David
Bromige on Friday evening and Saturday afternoon. This took place an old
2-story elementary school that has been converted into a community center:
hardwood floors, old style classrooms and blackboards, creaking chairs.
Time well spent for all involved of course. The value, purpose, and
applicability of writing exercises discussed and examined in action.
Fruitful conversation all around. (This is not too specific, I know.) DB
also provided a nice stack of photocopies of material from a variety of
writers with whom I, at least, was not familiar. Still enjoying that quite
a bit. Thanks again, David!

Next month at Subtext features Ezra Mark and Tom Raworth. This should also
warrant some reportage, no doubt.  In the meantime...


Salut--

David,

I don't know any details about Red Slider's removal from the poetics list,
but I do know that the e-address <TheFarm@ns.net> does not seem to be valid
(at least running whois & a couple of other arcane protocols came up with
nothing).  If mail to this address began to bounce & Red Slider didn't send

>further authentication of either his name or his e-ddress,

there'd be no way for the automated listserv program to deal with him.  If
Red Slider has been getting e-mail forwarded through this address, it may
no longer work.

As to the chilling quality of the prose you quote, whether it seems
"natural" or not, computers are so stupid they can only do what they are
told.  If a program like listserv has specific instructions on how to
respond to the words "unsubscribe", "kiss me", or "renga", when it finds
them in a message it can only respond that way.  For example, in the case
of several lists I'm on, using the word h e l p (without spaces) kicks the
message out to the listowner, no matter what context the word was used in,
delaying your message til someone forwards it with the offending word
changed.


In any case, the text you find so chilling is after this text:

>>Your  message   to  POETICS-request@LISTSERV.ACSU.BUFFALO.EDU   has  been
>>forwarded to the "list owners" (the  people who manage the POETICS list).
>>If you wanted to reach a human  being, you used the correct procedure and
>>you can ignore the remainder of this  message.

Since you were in fact trying to reach a real person, as it says, ignore
the remainder of the message, including what "naturally" follows.

No matter how much time WE may spend on line, thinking back to those times
the list reaches its fifty message limit, it's clear that Joel Kuszai,
Charles Bernstein, and whoever else administers the list sometimes take a
day or two off, especially on weekends.

I don't know whether the problem with Slider is only that his e-address
isn't valid, I haven't seen the correspondence you have.  I do know that
without a valid e-mail address it'd be difficult to receive e-mail from the
list.



>My message concerned Red Slider, and his request to me (via another list he
>and I are on) to lend him support in his attempt to find reinstatement on

It was the dime.  Rumor has it it was minted by Ezra Pound's father &
spent (his last) on a can of Bub's beer by Jack Spandrift in
North Cheese, Minnesota, in 1936.  As he spun it on the counter,
(just laid off of his cook's gig at the lumber camp) Jack was heard
to croon:

Lady Liberty, farewell,
I'm gonna cruise the gutter now -
ain't no silver gal in hell
can dance the tabletop like you -
you been good to me, so long,
I'm goin' dry...

Spandrift was arrested a few days later for vagrancy & wound up laying
side track for the Great Northern wearing stripes.  See Louis
Dexterious's collection _Sing a Soggy Sixpence : An Oral History
of Post-Prohibition North Cheese_, forthcoming from Univ. of Left

Subject:      Rural vs. Urban Poetics?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

When I left the Bay Area three years ago for Pullman, Washington, I fell
into a poetics void. Not only were readers of poetry not reading Clark
Coolidge, Hannah Weiner, or Mark Wallace, they hadn't even heard of them or
their compatriots -- formal innovation is not even (or uneven) on a horizon
dominated by personal expression. So I've been wondering:
        As a sub/plot/text of rural/urban demographic differentiations, is
there a split in poetics, rural versus urban?
        Why is a reader in Pullman or neighboring Moscow, Idaho (50,000
people, more than half of whom are associated either with Washington State
or the University of Idaho) more likely to read Sharon Olds than Lyn
Hejinian or Robert Haas rather than Ron Silliman?
        If English and Creative Writing professors are the powers that
determine, why are they knowledgable of the poetics of Olds and Haas with
virtually no knowledge of formal experimentation after the 1970's?
        Or more intriguing questions: Does geographic space (Pullman, in
the rolling hills of southeastern Washington, has no major metropolitan
area closer than Seattle five hours away) influence poetics? Is small town
pace reflected in the nature of language readers and writers choose to
engage?
        I have no doubt many on the list reside in rural areas -- what's
your take on this?
        As a standing invitation, if you're in the area (or willing to
drive from Seattle), I can offer a place to read in Moscow (and a place to
stay, of course).  Help in-form.
        Best, Crag Hill

I agree.  And yet...

What we seem to be talking about are changes of punctuation and
spelling.  If Danis Rose was editing Shakespeare rather than Joyce, he
would call this "modernization", and nobody would give it a second
thought.  Of the innumerable editions of Shakespeare now available, I
know of only two that diverge from the usual practice, which involves
modernization of spelling and punctuation on a scale far vaster than
Rose's program (the two are the original-spelling version of the
Oxford Shakespeare, and the Shakespeare Originals series).  And it
isn't just Shakespeare: there are lots of editions of poets as late as
Yeats that do this.  The Penguin English Poets and Longman Annotated
English Poets series impose modernization as part of their editorial
policy.  In the case of Shakespeare, you can at least present a good
argument that we have very little idea of how Shakespeare spelled and
punctuated; but this isn't the case with poets like Milton, Keats,
Shelley, and Browning, who are all published in modernized form in
these popular series.

And I own a copy of an anthology from a college course in which
Joyce's story "The Dead" is printed with conventional quotation marks,
rather than the dashes he's known to have preferred.  We've got plenty
of reason to be interested in the way Joyce wanted to spell and
punctuate, and we have very reliable information on his preferences; I
also am not convinced that modernization makes *Ulysses* noticeably
easier to read (assuming that's even a worthwhile goal).  Still, Rose
is getting a lot of heat for doing something that is actually a very
common practice.

        I, for one, am in a rural area and came here expecting a community
of language artists.  Iowa City, with its self-lauding poetry scene, is
decades behind despite its smug clasp on an international reputation.
Formally innovative anything is suspect here, and I beleive the isolation
of the individuals reflects the landscape.  It is the irrepressible
mediocrity of those individuals which is to blame.  Not the landscape.

I have emailed Red at his address (there is a website that "accompanies"
it) for many months.  how on earth could the address be nonfunctional or
invalid, etc.?  this is quite a mystery, indeed.

this situation needs to be sorted out.  this is not right.  what is

has to be a mistake.

I hope Red is back with us soon.

I'm a CS grad student doing a web project here at UCLA called Project
Artsvote at:

http://www.bantaba.net/artsvote/

Project Artsvote is basically an online survey asking peoples views on NEA
funding and Campaign Finance Reform. The results of every 10,000 valid
entries to Project Artsvote is summarized and then sent,  via e-mail, to
thousands of state & federal legislators as well as radio, newspapers and
television that i have in my online media and legislative databases.

I'm more concerned about these issues than an expert, so any suggestions
for improvement is most appreciated - particularly on the campaign finance
reform links page.

Also i'd like to know if anyone is interested in contributing an arts
'patch.' A patch is simply a web page which is about one's personal
experiences with art. This project is barely a week old, but as people
submit url's for patches i'll create a searchable index as a front
end so users can easily navigate the patch space. An art patch can be
a poem or set of photos, or an essay or whatever. Patches can support
or contradict the need for public arts funding.

On the whole this issue is simply (what a scientist would call) a sampling
problem, or an artifact of sample size....

In the current shape of U.S. culture, people move rather a lot, so altho
historically both modernism and pomo poetical currents grew up within city
contexts to some extent, the fact that pomo or non-mainstream poetry
activities are found mostly in cities is simply because they are
numerically minority pursuits.  There may be only 20 people deeply
interested in non-mainstream poetry activities in Georgia, for instance.
By virtue of the size of their populations, Gainesville, GA and ALbany GA
are far less likely to contain any of these folks than is Atlanta.

No okay in fact it's not that simple.  Non-mainstream poetry is an
art-activity that correlates with a number of other keen cultural
interests and preferences, ones most likely to be satisfied in a large
"metropolitan" city than a small midwestern town....(film, dance, music,
visual arts, circles that discuss all these)...And for that matter the
institutions that support non-mainstream poetry itself are also more
likely to exist in a larger city..(..because of the concentration of
people and of financial resources there, also because of "metropolitan"
exposure to currents from afar, that assist cross-fertilization and
cultual innovation...) And for these reasons people engaged in interesting
poetry are likely to prefer a larger city to live in, if the logistics of
making a living allows them any say...

But really, sample size is a lot of it.

You'll notice I am bringing up only rather materialist
explanations...Given high mobility and lack of cohesive long-lasting
communities in the contemporary U.S., I don't think there is a strong
correlation between poetic styles and rural vs. urban environments, at
least in any way that can be quantified or generalized...(How urban or
rural surroundings affect any one particular poet in her work and life is
another matter, and was a thread of considerable interest here about eight
months ago)

Welcome to the Internet, where InterNIC, the Gang that Couldn't Route
Straight, creates and deletes sites and addresses with an incomprehensible
aptitude for destruction previously reserved for volcano gods. This
happens a *lot*, and is usually a case of a misplaced piece of paper or
someone dozing off while doing global updates (really!).

I don't know fer shure if this has happened this time, but it is possible.

I didn't see the beginning of this thread, having been out of town and not
being able to face the 150+ old poetics messages that awaited me, but if
I'm surmising right what's being discussed here--I believe that the issue
is that pseudonyms are not allowed on the Poetics List--I don't think
there's anything *personal* being/having been done to RS.

david, don't be so paranoid!

re read the message.  it is not talking about a meat-and-flesh-and-bones
person striking people off with a pissy wave of a fontainbleau.  the
listerserver is a PACKAGE, i.e. a COMPUTER PROGRAM.  when you write to
"listserver" you are not, as the message iterates a few times, writing to a

m.f.b. person, but to a computer program.  the program searches through the
words in the body of the text for the few limited commands it understands,
i.e. "subscribe" (that tells it to run its subscribe routine), "unsubscribe"
etc.

so, if you write saying dear listerve, joe schmoe wants to unsubscribe, well,
computer program searches through the words of message, parsing for a word that
matches its list of command words, finds "unsubscribe" and happily runs its
unsubscribe program oblivious to any consternation and furrowed brows it
may be leaving behind.  think of it this way: if a captious programmer
wrote into the "listserve" program a cute little subroutine that sends his
or her mother's killer key lime pie recipe ("the world would be a better place
if everyone ate key lime pie") anytime the word "key" or "hate" appears in
the text of the message, and you accidently sent listerv a message saying
in the body of the text "joe went off to key west because he hates new york
in winter" you would get a key lime pie recipe...

Dodie and anyone who knows how this works,

Red Slider *is* Red Slider, and his email address *is* his email
address.  (He also has an extensive poetry website, is on two other
poetry lists I'm on, and I know where he lives, etc.)  How can the
"list" determine otherwise?  I don't understand.

Put another way: most creative writing departments, and for that matter lit
departments, are on the conservative side, despite the occasional oddball,
and in smaller college towns the college is the only likely vector.

I know I've experienced a lot of difficulty when I've changed servers and
then tried to unsubscribe so I could resubscribe correctly.  If you made any
changes at all, Red, that would explain everything.

Well it's more confusing than that.  For example some time has been spent
on this list discussing the two Kansas poets Kenneth Irby and Ronald
Johnson (oh I do hope I have that first name correct) --- there are major
figures who don't live in big cities or even near one (believe me, as far
as the arts go, KC doesn't count).

At this point in Lawrence KS you need more than one hand to count the
number of local poets that I at least find interesting, which is a vast
improvement over 10 years ago.  This is of course an artifact of the
mobility Mark Prejsnar mentioned, and a few personal crises here or there,
or conversely a couple of big lottery wins, could decimate the local scene.
Of course many of those who I don't find interesting don't find me
interesting either... we are all nice to each other at the local Dillon's,
we are midwesterners, midwesterners are nice.

"I am the psychotherapist"



I am the psychotherapist.  For your protection, I have been censored
according to the Communications Decency Act.  Please, describe your
problems.  Each time you are finished talking, type RET twice.

I cannot understand the language around me. I am moving to Japan.
I am beginning a new life. Oh, what will become of me?

Why do you say that?

Because I worry that I won't be able to recognize myself in the face
of others around me.

Is it because you worry that you will not be able to recognize
yourself in the face of others around you that you came to me?

Yes, not so much an alienation but a misrecognition, one of hundreds
of Gaijin, that is all.

Can you elaborate on that?

Koko ga itai n desu, the book says, It hurts here.

Maybe you should consult a doctor of medicine, I am a psychiatrist.

No, this is metaphoric, nothing more.

Earlier you said you worry that you will not be able to recognize
yourself in the face of others around you?

Yes.

I see...  Well, what makes you believe this is so?

Because I will be framed, because there is this woman ... I want ...
I don't know ... some sort of success, simplicity in my life ... to
write ... to fulfill my love, my work ... I can't express myself
clearly to you.

I don't understand.

Which part?

Perhaps your plans have something to do with this.

Yes, here we part company, your narrowly-defined nature comes through,
all too well...

Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?

God yes.

You mentioned that you worry that you will not be able to recognize
yourself in the face of others around you?

Yes, in your face as well.

How do you reconcile the people you hang around with?

They are transparent, translucent, now.

Are you sure that they are transparent translucent now?

Yes, halfway leaving, halfway here.

Do you really think you worry that you will not be able to recognize
yourself in the face of others around you?

Yes.

Yes, hmmm... so, what makes you think this is so?

Ah, now you're circular, there is little more to say; this returns,
and doesn't, to the beginning...

Possibly this has something to do with problems at school?

No.

Why not?

School is already in the past.

Tell me about your school.

There is nothing to say in this regard. It's in the past.

Are you afraid of that?

No, well, yes, teaching and all that, what I'm excellent at...

Does it bother you that what you are excellent at?

Don't understand.

Are you frightened by that?

No.

Are you annoyed that I ask that?

No.

Why not?

??

I would appreciate it if you would continue.

There's little more to say. Again, I have a blank face to you, to the
wall. I ask only for recognition, the most minor of sins. I
long... yes, I long...

Earlier you said you worry that you will not be able to recognize
yourself in the face of others around you?

Yes, we are back to that, aren't we?

When did you first know that are not you?

Ah, perhaps on July 31, 1997, I would think.

Maybe any hobbies you have are related to this.

No. Stop guessing...

Is it because of your sex life that you say stop guessing?

No...

Why not?

You repeat.

You mentioned that what you are excellent at?

Teaching.

Go on, don't be afraid.

I know.

Is it because of hangups you have that you are going through all this?

No, language, not hangups. This language, this repetition. We are lost
in these words, they cure nothing.

Why do you say that?

Because they stem from your limitations; I run slipshod around them.

Is the fact that they stem from my limitations you run slipshod around
them the real reason?

Yes.

I understand.  So what makes you believe this is so?

You.

I need a little more detail please.

Just you.

Are you sure that you worry that you will not be able to recognize
yourself in the face of others around you?

Yes. Another try, eh?

How do you reconcile your inhibitions?

I have none here.

Do you really think you have none there?

Yes.

Oh. ...And what makes you think this is so?

Because this is a discursive field, the boundaries yours, not mine.

Does the fact that this is a discursive field the boundaries mine not
yours explain anything else?

Nothing, nothing, nothing.

Actually, there are a lot of things that could cause problems. I must echo
the request someone made that paranoia be checked and people not jump to
the conclusion that an innocent man has been mistreated. Listservers do
not know when other systems go down for maintenence for instance, and if
Red's system bounced even a few list messages (which would be easy for
only a brief outage to trigger, given the volume of this list) than the
listserv might very well unsubscribe him. Other case scenarios abound. Has
he tried resubscribing? Has he spoken yet to the human being behind the
scenes? Something like this could even have been the result of a sysadmin
editing a file and accidentally leaving behind a tiny typo like an added
"." or something. I'm sure if the right person has been addressed that
this problem will be taken care of quickly.

BTW, I'm new to this list. Hi all.

dear list,

actually, red has received human messages on this matter after he wrote
asking about it, but still it is unclear what the real problem is.  all
this presumably centers around his name and his email address being in
some way invalid, but since red has written to clear that up, and it is
still not resolved, he is of course thinking there are other unrevealed
reasons he is off the list.

i send this because red cannot access the list himself at this time.  I
would only add to his info herein that "TheFarm" was never used as the
name of a person; it's merely an email address.  what does this have to
do with anything?  i've seen other equally creative non-name email
addresses on the list.

i realize i may be jeopardizing my subscription to Poetics by putting
this up, but so be it.  it seems important to get this straightened out,
and if this helps in any way to cut through the confusion, then it's
worth it.

While my 'average' list participation is less than 2 ('a few') (26/17
days
for sept.) i also see that it is disproportionately large? Though I do
note
several others with some heavy useage on particular days and do wonder
if
they received similar communications? I will endeavor to keep my
postings
within limits.

I do, however, wonder by whom, and on what basis, my name is being
challenged? I find it a bit insulting and wonder on what presumptive
basis
someone things (sic) it does [serve] not as my "real name".  I use my
name
responsibly, it is a pointer to reliable communications with me on any
matter and is a name under which I submit print & electronic poetry. If
you
or anyone has a problem with that I gladly invite them to communicate
with
me directly with me and identify themselves - by handle or real name.

On the other hand, if it is the content of my messages which seem
inappropriate or off point then I would certainly like to hear that
directly said - backchannel or otherwise. Other than a single message
from
someone who apparently felt uncomfortable with a question on poetics and
'protected group' access, I have received no communications suggesting
I'm
'round the bend', out of topic or otherwise 'off my meds'. Quite the

Dear Sir,

Your own concern as to who wrote the note is quite interesting in this
context. According to our policy, we must know the real name of all

have no problem with handles, pen names or the like; but we reserve the
right to ask for the legal names, and addresses if necessary, of all
subscribers with indeterminate userids. We recognize this greatly limits
the focus and possibilities of our list but are confident that there are
many other lists with different policies on this point for those
interested. If you read the original note we sent again you will note
that
all that we said that we were writing as a matter of list policy and
that
the content of your messages were related to this; if we didn't mean
that
we would not have said it. By the way this note is not written by
"Joel".

--------------------------------
Postnote from me:

I have tried to act as a good citizen in this group. I hold responsible
two-way communication under the name 'red slider' (under which,
incidently
the AG of the State of California has no qualms about serving a
subpoena,
and under which I've ordered and paid for books advertised in this list,
and under which my poetry is known, etc.). If it is the will of this
group
that I remove my self (whom or how the list may wish to decide is their
business),  i will gladly do so. My backchannel coms indicated that at
least some of my posts have been appreciated. But I would wonder at any
list that wished to 86 someone for content unless it was personally
abusive. Well, enough said and I think it enough that this be brought
into
the open, where it belongs, and not left to unsigned notes to intimidate
someone into quietly 'going away' - the message from the Gulag was
chillingly clear the first time around.

If i looks like list members want me out - I'll say now I've appreciated
the many interesting and valuable things gained.

While Red Slider asserts in the message recently forwarded to the list,
surely he and his friends must realize that "Red Slider" *sounds* like a
pseudyonym. Red asserts that he uses this name as a professional moniker,
which presents a new problem to the list. But if what he says is true,
and I have no reason to doubt him, then it is reasonable for him to
participate under that name.

But given the history of the list, and our avowed and repeatedly-stated
interest in keeping discussion at a certain above-board level, it would have
been nice of "Red" to introduce himself when he first started posting to
the list. Just to explain that "Red Slider" is the name he goes by.

We have had people before using pseudonyms whose purpose clearly was
*not* to participate in an open manner. It is fair for us to be
suspicious, and the Welcome message that Red and all new members receive
-- & that's at the archive, etc. -- should provide enough clues for new
members who want to participate in a somewhat different manner, just to
provide the rest of us some accounting of that manner. I don't think
that's a lot to ask.

& part of what makes the handle look suspicious, Layne, is that not just
"Red Slider" but "TheFarm@ns.net" looks like an attempt to hide. Herb
Levy's point, if I remember right, is that *not* "The Farm" but "ns.net"
that looks like part of a "virtual" email address. Which is to say that it
looks like -- it may well *not* be -- a "fake" address that reroutes mail
to Red Slider's real address. If it was, you would still be able to mail
to Red Slider just as you do, but his "real" address might be
mike@netcom.com. Using such "virtual" addresses creates an appearance of
wanting to be hidden. That seems a violation of the spirit of Poetics.

I believe Red Slider should be reinstated on the list. I also believe
that a few words of explanation, if "Red Slider" is a true professional
name and "TheFarm@ns.net" is an email address pointing to a true Internet
machine, would have prevented this from the beginning, and that some
interest on Red's part in familiarizing himself with the list -- as the
Welcome message asks him to do -- would have helped as well.

If you search the archives for the messages from "Filch" and the
discussion following them, just for example, you will see why the members
of the list have a right to be cautious.

your thoughtful reply midst the confusion is appreciated.  I have
forwarded it to Red Slider.

the msg from an an unidentified list authority of some kind (it just
says that he's "not Joel") in the post I put up states that "the farm"
*is* in question, and also, that pen names are not a problem.

I still don't get why the email address looks suspicious.  just for the
record here, NSNet is listed in the 916 area code section (Red lives in
the Sacramento area) of the "Internet Service Providers" catalog
published bimonthly by Boardwatch.  "the farm"?  well, many providers
let you choose the name you want; Red is a big-time gardener!

the name?  I have seen amazing names...Red Slider?  I have a jewelry
designer friend whose name is Jay Roach!  (and yes, it is his birth
name.)  so who's to say?  who's to say that Layne Russell is my birth
name?  and does it matter?  also, don't know how many states in which
this is so, but in California it is legal to have one alias.  so, if
someone is putting forth all correspondence and publications and website
under one consistent identity, why would I question this identity?

it seems to me that all this could be cleaned up fairly easily.

why was Red not asked a few simple questions first before being cut off?

Hi, everyone. I just sent the enclosed message to Red Slider, and want
to repost it. I don't know what's gone down backchannel, but this issue
does deserve attention.

Red,
        I just saw Layne Russell's forward of the message you received
about not having authorization to post messages from "TheFarm@NS.NET".
I received a similar message several months ago when my domain name
changed from "@tribeca.ios.com" to "@idt.net," and a note to the
listserv corrected the problem quickly. Since you don't appear to have
changed your email address, I don't understand [probably any more than
you do] that message from the listserv.
        Nor do I remember any particularly vicious messages from you to
the list [certainly nothing above about a 3 on the Beaufort scale], so
that doesn't seem a credible reason for your ouster, either.
        As to the name issue, I wonder whether Lewis Carroll or Mark
Twain would've found themselves chased out of wonderland by angry cards
[sorry] or pushed off the stern of a riverboat. Novalis wouldn't stand a
chance. What about Woody Allen? Englebert Humperdinck? The Artist
Formerly Known As Prince? <<BTW: If I remember correctly, Kim Dawn
Baker's name originally appeared in the "From:" line simply as "Kim
Dawn"--possibly worth asking the listserv about?>> Not to mention some
dissident writer resorting to an alias in attempting to stay alive and
still communicate from a country where identity=death! Perhaps your
point about the CA AG issuing a subpoena in [dare I call it?] YOUR NAME
will carry some weight. I hope so.
        Best,
Dan Zimmerman

Subject:      readers' versions of great lit
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I don't think we need to be intimidated by anything, & surely not by
readers' versions of great lit.  Are we really intending to go on
reproducing novels & poems from the past word for word into an infinite
future? Give me a break!

I append two "readers' versions" of two recognizable poems (of which one is
only partially here; I got tired)  by two poets who have recently been
mentioned on the List, & inquire, Where is the harm in it?

* * * * * * * *


The great poet "disappeared."
It was during a cold spell.
When the day "died," the mercury
In the thermometer in "its" "mouth"
Began to congeal. It "grew" shorter.

On other Channels one watched wolves
Running through trees & bushes
Or rivers with spiffy quays & locks;
The poems didn't know he had "vanished,"
Because poems don't _know_ anything.

You only go around once
& you only die once & he spent an afternoon
Doing just that; funny (odd) when you think
About it happening to yourself. Here
Today, gone tomorrow; where's the point of it?
A human being's physicality allies us
With our creations : systems of transportation like the Tube,
Those neat little parks Brits put in the middle of squares.
After you die, you _are_ what they read, if you wrote.

Now he can be violated by anyone
With no chance to defend himself :
He shouldn't have published all those poems.
He's become a ticker tape parade.

Stockbrokers' assistants are a noisy lot.
Scarcely better than animals, & surely more ugly.
When you are poor, & own no stock,
You have to get used to beauty being inedible,
Although it can be licked. (This bit is about
Consolations, I guess, to highlight the inconsolable).
After all, if you never leave the house
& live alone, you often get your own way.
Where were you when you heard Yeats had died?
Was it cold and dark where you were, too, Ranjit ?


* * * * * * * * *

I was the first person performing an act with an object
Slightly south of the Mason-Dixon Line. I describe the object
& tell something of how as a result of the action I performed,

The entire environment was changed, leastways subjectively.
It behaved ("sprawled") just as it had before, so wasn't changed,
But I tell you it was changed, & that says something about me.

My object was a man-made thing & I felt it tamed the whole scene.
It rimed with words like itself--per-fect, ne-glect--& was tall.
(Not as tall as me.)  It carried the brandname of its manufacturer

Wherever it went. Being the result of artifice, although made of minerals,
It could never have kits or pups or chicks, or young sprouts.
This is all I can recall of the incident. My husband sired these triplets.

Leslie Scalapino=B9s writing takes place in the fickle, monumental and often
beautiful present: now. (If there were no present tense, her writing alone
would have invented and identified it.) But it expands back and forth,
pumping like a systole, into the primitive past and the unimaginable
future. We in the Bay Area are spoiled, for we get to have Leslie Scalapino
with us _almost all the time._ An outstanding performer and playwright, she
is the author of many books, including the recent _Green and Black:
Selected Poems_ (Talisman House Books).

The brilliant Nuyorican poet and performance worker makes his debut in San

Comments: To: TheFarm@ns.net, layne@sonic.net

dear red slider

i think in the blitz of all this, you are taking this list thing perhaps more
personally than meant.  i don't offer this so much in a gently-chiding-i-
understand-the-world way as in a sympathetic, but not wanting to see this
all continue to go wildly askew way...  the first time my poetics mail shut
off i thought i got bumped and sent backchannel a few inquiries and felt quite
censored and hurt-feelinged till i found out that NO ONE was getting mail! now
i'm a veteran of a few years, i've seen that happen enough times that it is
almost a predictable thing.  everytime list goes down, someone sends a sad
little note saying "geez why won't anyone let me have mail" or akin.

i realize that isn't your issue, but it is analogous.  now, re your
issue, there are lots of things you are perhaps not taking into
account.  first, this list has a number of "well-known" (in the wierd
incestous literature/ academy kind of way) people.  it has lots of
people no ones ever heard of.  it has poets, musicians, academics.  it
has posts of all sorts.  so, speaking from long readership, there is
clearly not a Big Brother waiting out there to censor writers.

but there is a pretty rational policy.  people could (probably someone
has tried at one time or another) subscribe under someone else's name
w/o their permission and write lots of things that person would never
have said.  or one could subscribe as an unknown young faculty member
if one had a grudge against that particular unknown faculty member and
by posting cleverly do some real damage to a career.  hence, i think
the poetics list owners have decided no fake names.  period.  you are
who you are so you take responsability for what you post.

re last, this list has been used,and i've seen it used, as a primary
research site, and though we expect things are always verified, still,
papers have been written from material generated on this list.  again,
one could do some pretty irresponsible misinforming if one took it into
one's head to do so (and i speak of a victim of this exact thing).  an
inflexible "real name" rule at least reduces chances of this.

i don't know if listowners insist on real name appended to all posts, but
i think at the least, they want to be themselves in possession of certainty
that whoever you say you are is really who you are.  in situation of someone
from country where they are in fear of political retaliation, we had a
discussion about that a while ago in another context -- someone on list who
has since been taken off posted some very private material with a phone
number and name attached for no real reason.  one of the main fears was,
in fact, the possibility that in open net environment, person whose number
was violated might be subjected to net harassment.  if someone from a
repressive country wanted subscription to list, probably a talk with
listowners/sys admins might be enough to clear matter, but it is possible that
the mechanisms of listserve program simply will not allow use of pseudonyms,
no matter what.  program protocals may be set up to boot anything coming
back as undeliverable, and since software not written at buffalo, but obtained
as package, i don't think it can be rewritten.

anyway, layne, the reason "TheFarm" is being assumed to be a name is that the
convention, in email addresses, is to have NAME@address.type, i.e.
BetsyRoss@america.com or JRoth@biguniversity.edu.  if red slider's name really
IS red slider, and he just uses nickname "TheFarm" as his email name, he should
be ok.  but i think the problem might be that we start with funky non-name
name, and go to what sounds like another non-name, "red slider."  the worst
(so far, and hopefully period) mess we had was generated by an unknown person
hiding behind a fake name -- as i'm sure you can imagine, when people are
using a fake name, the possibility for abuse widens considerably.

boringly yours

All--I for one have gotten this exact same message on a few occassions.
My University account, from which I am subscribed, uses three different

@gmu.edu).  When I log in, I am connected to whichever server is least
busy, unless I specify which I want.).  I can only post, however, from my
osf1 address (even though it is equivalent to the others, the Listserve
has no way of knowing that.)  The message I've quoted above is
automatically sent whenever there's any confusion over an email address.
I've gotten it too, and no-one's trying to kick me off the list.

The followups about names appear to be beside the point.  Its an address
foul-up, not an identity issue.

except, I note that formerly Red had posted to the List from exactly
the same address -- which leads me to think some accident occurred,
such that his address, w/o intention, got dropped from the roster.

The simple remedy (& a test of this "it ain't nuthin' but a mixup"
reading of the situ ayshun) should be to re-subscribe.

copying Red, for what worth.

Terry Gross had Robert Pinsky on Fresh
Air last night. I missed a lot of the
interview because I was assembling furniture
while listening and the electric screwdriver
drowned him right out but most of what I
did hear made me swear (example: Terry
asks what he thinks of performance poetry
and he says, "well I'm not *against*
it--" [translate: I'm against it]).

Here's the good part:
In closing Terry mentioned that the biggest
problem people have with poetry is that
they feel they don't understand it. Pinsky
says, "but people like a lot of things
they don't understand... sex comes to mind."

my current philologist hero Potebnia (of Kiev, 19th cent.) based his
whole theoretical edifice on the concept of the "inner image" -
a characteristic shared on different levels both by language in general
and by poetry - the essential quality of which is excess of meaning
or unlimited denotation/connotation -

as opposed to "scientific prose" at the other end of the scale, in which
the referent of a word is strictly limited -

do we understand this?  But I don't read this as a license for

There are two distinct things about the recent Red Slider affair.

One is the simple automated reply to a post from an e-mail address that's
not on the list.  This is no big deal, regardless of how ominous the
generic text may sound to some.  This message for instance was first sent
through the ISP I use when I'm not home (cause I'm not home) & poetics only
recognizes me@eskimo.com, so I got the bounce message.

As a few folks have posted, this can be due to a lot of things that are out
of any individual's hands, ISP's change things around in ways that don't
affect how we use then, but can affect the way our communicaations with the
outside world.

The other problem with this, however, is the subsequent exchange with
Slider, not simply because it's unsigned, but because in addition to the
bounce message, further action was taken that seems to have been
arbitrarily meted out.

All that said, I'd like to note my favorite line from Slider's poetry Web site:

"Biography: just like it says, a brief bibliography."

Since David is impatient, attached is Small Press Traffic's Official

just a brief reminder to the folks out there=97
& hopefully a small corrective to the, um,
paranoia that seems to be growing from
DB's wonderfully witty "1984" reference
(& you'd just let it go, too, you devil!)=97
re "email technology", viz. that (as always)
what appears to be a simple transaction, e.g.
this message sent from one address to another,
actually masks a very complex system of
exchange. for example, my email address is
        calexand@library.utah.edu
=97but that address is really just a dummy
which conceals a good deal of the process
of getting mail to me, ostensibly (& indeed
this is usually the case) simplifying the
process @ the user end. at one time, mail
sent to me @ this address eventually came
to me on the library's Alexandria server
(get it?), but then I was moved to another
server, then my "context" on that server
was changed, then the address standard
for our organization was changed & so
forth. so though my email address has
apparently remained the same, the actual
address that I was receiving mail @ &
*posting from* has changed several times=97
not unlike the example Dean gives of
accessing his mail via different addresses.
each of these changes has involved some
re-negotiation with Listserv, the program
that powers the poetics list, & with the
folks who maintain it (special thanks to
Joel, but also his invisible fellows like
the mysterious "not Joel").

for an example of how complex all of
this really is, try to find the "show all
headers" or a comparable command in
your email software, & examine the
"full header" of this message, i.e., the
full path of its transmission beginning
with my server & ending with yours.
here's what I get when I view Dean's

there's no reason to decipher all of this=97
suffice to say, there's more going on here

the most likely problem is an "invisible"

Given the interest among Listopolitans in the Red Slider case, I hope
further elucidation will be forthcxoming from the Buffalo office. While it
is so that some of his messages from Head Office were computer-generated,
it is quite clear that at least one missive (forwarded to the List by Layne
Russell) was written by a person. What is needed now is for that person to
step forward and address the List, so that we can hear his/her version
events, and learn whether Red Slider has been axed for rule-violations
(which rules? how transgressed? on what evidence?), or whether what we are
witnessing here is merely a rush of power to the head somewhere in the
Snowy City.

Pinsky on NPR : I seldom listen to NPR, probably because I am within range
of KPFA, and why eat hamburger when you can have steak? But perhaps I
malign NPR. I know they offer Andrei Codrrescu.  But apart from that, do
they offer poets of a stripe not that of Robert Pinsky? Has any one of the
following smatter of poets been aired : Ron Silliman, Lyn Hejinian, Bob
Perelman, Leslie Scalapino, Bruce Andrews, Abigail Childs, Steve McCaffery,
Karen Mac Cormack, Jackson Mac Low, Jennifer Moxley, Charles Bernstein, Rae
Armantrout, Pierre Joris, Laura Moriarty, Michael Davidson, Harriet Mullen,
Nick Piombino, Erica Hunt? If so, on which program, and at what time does
it air? Thanks.

I am sorry that the savage irony of my "readers' versions" posting didn't
come through. It's probably because my travesties were too good. To be dull
about it, we _do_ have the originals, but must take care to indicate to the
students which these are, agreed. My purpose split when I started having
too much fun. I will be posting versions of Olson and Milton later this
week.  And James, I will do you too if you will post a poemn to the List.
As for a contract with Hallmark, I'm ready. It can't be worse than the
movie of the book, and there are hungry mouths to be fed.

And of course, as George Bowering would point out, my entire oeuvre is a
travesty of his.

that sounds like:

I'd prefer to think it implies a *different* kind
of understanding or is structured by a different
kind of (dialectical?) logic, as opposed to this
"vagueness/mystery/obscurity"=97or at least I'd
opt for that characterization right now.

Henry, are you familiar with the work of Jean Jacques LeCercle
(specifically, *The Violence of Language*)? I'm not particularly
taken with him, but it does seem like (some)one might be able to
do something with the apparent relation between Potebnia's theory
& LeCercle's "we speak language" &/or "language speaks us" model.

best, Chris

        Henry,
        The mystification, how can it be anything but lazy?  Brave and
lazy at once.  The sweat comes in when one transposes their mystical
experience into text.  And what of chance operations?  Doesn't
indeterminacy, instead of precluding the mystical, reverse the dynamic?

No, and don't be silly. Last spring Robert Hass was on twice (once
with Pinsky). I'm sure Rita Dove has been on as well, plus Maya Angelou...

Actually, I find the interviews fascinating. I suppose this is because I
relish the sensation of frustration. Seriously, it's good to reinforce
that the poet laureate is who you'd basically expect he'd be.

Much worse than the interviews are the poetry clips on NPR. Last winter
they were on an "anti-poem" kick and it seemed like Naomi Shihab Nye
was in my speaker every damn week.

But I don't expect much of radio in that way, i.e., I don't expect it to
include non-mainstream poets. I think my expectations grow out of the
fact that radio is expensive and in general it seems that the more
something drips with money the more standard it's likely to be. In
contrast, I expected much more "risky" (i.e., potentially offputting to
the reader) poems to appear in Hass's poet's corner, but in the 100 or so
weeks he's done it, I there has been ONE Sun & Moon poet by my count and
few if any small-press poets.

Subject:      Readers' versions of great lit
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

When I was a kid I used to read Classic Comics (I think they were called),
the ultimate readers' versions. These were about three times the width of
ordinary comics (you need a few pages for Les Miserables), with a lot more
words than most comics, although must of the narrative had been converted
to dialogue bubbles. Intellectual kids like me read this stuff instead of
horror comics--less likely to induce nightmares, and good for you, too!
Sometimes, I later learned, the plots were wildly rearranged to protect the
innocent. It was nice having pictures, but fortunately these didn't
stick--I don't even remember what their Captain Ahab looked like.
I don't think they ever did Joyce, but it would be a worthy project: an
adult version that could be finished in a lunchtime. Proust would probably
take a week. And the possibilities for advertizing sales go way beyond ant
farms.
On a different note, does anybody but me remember the Gilbert Shelton
illustrated editions of Chaucer's pilgrims? One of them, the Miller's Tale,
if memory serves, was done in honest-to-god Middle English. And I do
remember his Alisoun, the miller's wife--quite a babe.

I thank all those who have written in to explain what a portion of Red
Slider's problem may be. The workings of the computer & its various
softwares are fascinating indeed.

However, there is a danger that these explanations will also function to
explain away the following, which I re-post to the List because some of
those concerned give no sign of having read it. (Herb Levy, thanks for your
recent post on this topic,a post with which I am in complete agreement.)

So, what were those contents? I have read Red's posts, & found nothing as
offensive as much stuff that has passed muster before; which of his posts
did I miss, that "were related" to his being axed? Please, Not-Joel, be so
good as to refer us to these messages of Red, so that we may (one hopes)

I wasn't referring to the mystical - just mystification, as in
lazy or purposeful mumbo-jumbo.  Purposeful obscurity.  I don't go
for that.  Am extremely old-fashioned in my opinions about this.
Don't think "language writes us", "language liberates us", etc.
I like the author who fills every nook & cranny & syllable & nuance
with purposeful intent.  I also know this is impossible.  But I think
Joyce tried to do it.  I think he learned it from the scholastics &
the cathedral builders, whose every move was governed by dialectical
debate.  The apse of Amiens a resolution of contradictory approaches in
2 earlier constructions.  Problem-solving.  Explicit statement.  "Progress"
in poetry might involve delimiting just such contradictions in past work
& resolving them, synthesizing them.  Does our atmosphere of "experiment"
foster this kind of discipline?  Or is it every mumbo-jumboer for
him-herself?  Just thinkin' out loud here...  [loosen up Hank, said

It wasn't always so. There was a time, maybe twenty years ago, when Susan
Howe produced a weekly series of readings on WBAI, New York's then Pacifica
station, and I produced poetry specials. I remember doing Armand Schwerner
reading the entire (as of that date) The Tablets, a lengthy interview and
reading with Paul Metcalf, and two 2 1/2 hour shows of resurrected and
remastered readings by Jack Spicer (who did his own radio show 15 years
before that on San Francisco's Pacifica station).

small pt. of clarification for the list: I'm not sure LeCercle's
position is so much liberatory as explanatory=97& with that
in mind, his model seems very much like that of Potebnia, at
least @ this level of generality. that one's my fault for not
citing more extensively.

There's a local comics artist by the name of David Lasky who's done a
9-page mini-comic version of Ulysses. Two frames for each of chapter. It's
really surprisingly accurate for that level of brevity. Quite a kick.
Lasky has also done a more biographical comic on Joyce, published by Aeon
Press.

I believe someone's also done a comics version of the first section of
Finnegans Wake. Pretty sure actually, though I can't recall the artists
name at the moment. Can dig up the info on these if anyone's interested.

Anyhow, preferable to Rose's grammarian renderings in both cases I would

I hope these are wonderful works of art in their own right, whatever their
connection to the original. But I'm struck once again by the plight of the
social satirist in the land of the pet rock: America tends to parody itself
inadvertently faster and more accurately than the most mordant of wits.

        Henry,

        Points well taken, but I, for one, have trouble with a notion of
poetry progressing.  How can its effectiveness be theoreticized out of the
very private and obscure author/reader relation?  Purposeful intent meets
with the same solopsitic ruts as the cathedral builders.  What Joyce does
resembles the sort of thouroughness you suggest, but it is only as
effective for some.  And why?  Not for anyone to say as much as it is for
everyone to say.
        Agreed, though.  Lazy writing isn't hard to spot.  But it comes in
all flavors, don't it?

Dodie is right. The Poetics List reserves the right to ask for the real
names and addresses of all subscribers. We take this as a basic
responsibility of administering this list and facilitating the automatic
and unedited distribution of so many messages (up to 50 a day) to so many
people (about 500). I have no problem with handles, pen names or the like,
and recognize that this policy limits the focus and possibilities of the
Poetics List. For those interested, there are many other places on the
Internet with different policies on this point: pseudonyms are a major
dynamic on many web sites.
        I very much appreciated Eliza McGrand's and David Golumbia's post on this
matter, and they together highlight a number of concerns I share.
Certainly, the use of pseudonyms might be fine in a number of circumstances
and I realize the Poetics List has a relatively conservative stance on
this. But it should be noted that pseudonyms and pseudoaddresses on the
Internet are not the same as in the age of print. Handles, web names, and
phantom addresses on the Internet pose a different set of problems and no
doubt a new set of possibilities. Nor is the use of a handle on a fantasy
site the same as the use of the same handle in a newsgroup, chat line,
moderated list (where an editor reads all messages before they are posted),
a local list where people are in frequent face-to-face contact, a literary
magazine or other edited web publication, or on an unedited listserve with
the stated interests and purposes as this one (and, again, Eliza detailed
some of the issues I am concerned about here). Certainly, if we ask a new
subscriber for further information on their userid, name, or address and
they "prefer not to" say, there is no reason to make any value judgement on
this choice.

As to "bad" addresses, and as several people have noted, when the Poetics
List has a problem with an address, we often don't have the time to figure
out what went wrong or to send out additional notes about the status of the
address. We have to rely on subscribers to provide us with working and
authenticatable addresses.

All subscription information and correspondence relating to subscriptions
on the list is confidential. The exception to this is the list of current
subscribers, which can be obtained with the "review poetics" command.
Please use this command to find addresses of subscribers rather than making
an inquiry of the whole list.


Finally, let me end with this: My name is Charles Bernstein and I am
Listowner of the Poetics List. I take the responsibility of being listowner
quite seriously, probably too seriously. As I've said before, it can often
seem to interfere with my ability to participate in the list as fully as I
might otherwise enjoy. While I discuss list policies and procedures with
those who generously volunteer their time to help me with list management,
I take full and personal responsibility for decisions relating to the
protocols and functioning of the list. My office address is 438 Clemens
Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 on the North Campus of SUNY-Buffalo, where I am
employed. My phone number at UB is 716-645-3810; if I am not available, a
message can be left. I can be most easily reached at the email address
listed in the header of this message. Due to the volume of Poetics-related
subscription mail (mostly related to bounced mail), I prefer if questions
about the list be sent to a special administrative account set up for the
Poetics List: poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu. Access to this account is
restricted to those working directly with me on the list. -- I take it that
all of this are given facts to every subscriber on this list.
         I find it quite ironic, and at the same time chilling, that a subscriber
who prefers not to give the Poetics List an address or any information
about his name other than a nonspecific userid, complains that no personal
name was given in correspondence from the Poetics List. But the point of
calling attention to the Personal Name ("temporary name") that appears
before that @ of the address -- the point, that is, of not signing the
message sent to this subscription address-- was just to emphasize the
fungibility of names in this environment and to make apparent the need to
know to whom on is exchanging messages. Of course this is unsettling: it
unsettles me. The reaction of the subscriber suggests the value of the
policy. Furthermore, I take it as a given that personal communications
between individuals, correspondence about subscriptions, as well as other
writings by individuals, are not to be reproduced on this or any list
without the permission of the author. In this instance, in the letter that
was forwarded to this list, we have an example of what happens when that
principle is not followed. Indeed, I have only just realized, in reading
one of the recent posts, that a word was elided in one sentence of a letter
sent to one of the list subscribers:

>if you read the original note we sent again you will note that
>>all that we said that we were writing as a matter of list policy and that
>>the content of your messages were

word dropped: NOT

>related to this

In conjunction with that original note, it might have been apparent that
"content" *has never been* and *is not* an issue in this instance,
especially since both notes make clear what the issue is. Of course the
elision of "not" is regrettable; but this note was not intended to be
reproduced twice to 500 people and scrutinized for unintended meaning.
Furthermore, there were a number of ways that the possible
misinterpretation of the dropped "not" might have been clarified, short of
sending the note out to the entire list.
        In any case, at the other end of the line at Poetics is me, among others,
and I think it's fair to say that it's unlikely that any of this is about
anything other than what I have stated here. And if you want to know where
I am to discuss it, you know that too, so send me an email or come by to
see me. I'm around (if too often neither here or there but someplace else
and in a knot).

Charles,

why you are here beginning a (rather transparent) rationalization for
probably failed policy and certainly misapplied ones is beyond me. In the
first place, a formal complaint has been made to the Director, and it might
have been appropriate to leave these matters for his investigation. Second,
you could have communicated with me (since you have forbidden me to
communicate with you) on the 'missing not' - we might have discovered
something. But there is nothing now but to take this bit of informal time
and deal with piece meal - I will not address most of Charles' List Owner
rationalizations for policy and such - there are much better analysts here
than I who can see what is going on. I'll simply address the 'not knot' and
leave it there for now - I didn't even want to do that much.

If there was any eliding it was somewhere/somehow on Charles' side, and
could have been an unfortunate typo of his (or do we want to explore the
theory that the machine just happened to drop this critical term? Or does
someone wish to speculate on which one of us is lying?) His critical 'NOT'
was not found here on receipt. Of course, if the letters had not been
anonymous and I could have asked my questions - or if it had been worth
Charles' time to deal with these matters (he instructed me not to
communicate with him or Joel at their addresses on these matters on the
basis of his time) we might have been able to straighten it out. But
Charles' your list of particulate locations and identities does not erase
your communications (are you the not-joel?) or your handling of my letter
to Joel and your obvious remoteness in the officiate of your list owning
position. I'm starting to smell some smoke. Better to leave it with the
investigation, if there is to be one, and what ever list discussion might
ensue on substantive issues (I find most of yours rather secondary to
questions David, I and others have rased). Dodie, by her own admission
didn't really know what was going on, no? Hardly a solid foundation.
Anyway, once again, here is the second posting  of the anonymous,
'Temporary Name' communication, exactly as I recieved it - no changes, no
elides. And, I think a siezure of all records at the server site on
anything remotely pertaining to these matters is certainly now in order
(don't want any machine erasing files problems - could happen). I suggest
these be conducted from Dr. Glazier's office. Just my suggestion.

Dear Sir,

Your own concern as to who wrote the note is quite interesting in this
context. According to our policy, we must know the real name of all
subscribers. "The Farm" is not a sufficient userid for this purpose. We
have no problem with handles, pen names or the like; but we reserve the
right to ask for the legal names, and addresses if necessary, of all
subscribers with indeterminate userids. We recognize this greatly limits
the focus and possibilities of our list but are confident that there are
many other lists with different policies on this point for those
interested. If you read the original note we sent again you will note that
all that we said that we were writing as a matter of list policy and that
the content of your messages were related to this; if we didn't mean that
we would not have said it. By the way this note is not written by "Joel".

Dear List,

As a member of the list without any allegiances whatsoever, with no
interest whatsoever in any poetry wars, with absolutely no personal
friendships with anyone whatsoever on the list, maybe I can speak with the
authority of an irrelevant outsider.

I think that Red Slider should direct his paranoia elsewhere.

I for one am tired of him.

I think that this might be a good time to take this backchannel. As it's
still public, for the record, early in my list membership (not so long aqo)
I found myself unable to send or receive. I had sent some mildly snippy
posts, and, being an American, I immediately proceeded to paranoia (it's
the national sport)--there was a conspiracy, I was being ejected, punished,
whatever. Of course it was a technical problem. But paranoia is much more
satisfying--behind it is the assumption of one's own importance or power to
be perceived as a threat.

I don't identify myself as a language poet, and I've only met The
Listmaster a couple of times (Listmaster is great, sounds like startrek).
My experience has been that the list is run very fairly and with great
generosity. I doubt that anybody gets rich or powerful by providing the
rest of us with this venue.

One of my friends likes to counter his own paranoia with generosity of
spirit by telling himself not to assume malice when folly is an adequate
explanation. I would change the second clause to "folly or a glitch."

the "content of your messages were related to this" means having "subscribe"
"unsubscribe" etc. caused reader to axe, and also, that content of message
TO RED FROM LISTSERV, i.e. "your message" as distinct from "joe schmoe's
message (message to joe schmoe" were related to list policy.

there is NO BIG BROTHER.  NO THOUGHT POLICE.  NO ONE READ RED SLIDER'S
POSTS AND SAID "AXE HIM"!!!   ok!!!!!!!????

it is a matter of the way the program is built, and the protocals it uses
to screen the mass of information coming at it.  charles et al GOT this
program, already written by someone else, sealed in celophane, as it were,
off the shelf (though i think listserv is actually shareware and free).
someone with MASSIVE amounts of computer know-how WROTE THIS PROGRAM.  it
is completely unrealistic to take charles et al to task for standard features
of program -- i think they are doing splendidly to have figured out how to
load it.  it is beyond unrealistic and completely off the wall to ask them
to rewrite or change it.  it was written by PROFESSIONAL, VERY CLEVER
computer programmers who got paid alot of money by universities and development
funding and macarthur grants to write it.  charles couldn't, probably,
even get past encryptment into base code to even begin to understand it,
probably, much less rewrite it!

i think charles and joel are doing the best they can with a pretty intricate
software package made to manage an extraordarily tedious and complex task.
i have seen this software used throughout the world on the net and it works
the same way because that is they way it is written, not because there is
a plot to censor people -- it cuts people off list if their address sends
back "undeliverable mail," if their address won't send a bounceback, and
so on and so forth.

sheesh!

red slider, i think you have entirely too much free time.  if you think you

things go) and are so willing to put so much energy into attacking someone
who has had a whole lot of gumption, decency, and put in unimaginable
amounts of work into building a net list and community, why don't you
channel some of that energy into doing something constructive like starting

or address error and sooth yet another subscriber entangled in computer
problems (i've had a message from joel and charles originated AFTER 10PM
on a sunday just to offer advice on a message-address problem, for one
of i know MANY examples) you will have another, very embarrassed and
regretful view of your painfully ... well, i'll eschew pejoratives, but
let us just say "misguided" attempt to sandbag charles, joel, and all the
interns and helpers and others who've put so much into this poetics listserv.

i can only hope, but must firmly believe (in order to believe in anything

sense and grace to see both the huge amount of work, FOR ABSOLUTELY NO
MONEY WHATSOEVER, charles et al have put into poetics and the extraordinary

Absolutely right, those who've seen I went too far - each in their own way.
Insensed at the idea that someone accused me of eliding an important part
of a document. That word means to me deliberate alteration - falsification.
But no matter, no excuse to say more. It would have been enough to have
said, "no, that word was not in my copy." and let it go. What has happened
to me, by me, over this matter, no matter how trivial or serious its
particulars is not good. It is not my tao. Not the way I've lived it. And
when I found myself ranting to one particular friend (and to no other i
think - Dodie, anyone else, feel free to backchannel/post any messages of
mine, I don't think they were that bad, but I've no perspective anymore) it
was time for me to say, "I'm off my meds".

I meant no ill to Charles or Joel or anyone. Had a nice post& reply bck
with Eliza in fact that I really enjoyed, and learned. Yes I argued the
points. Maybe, in time i'd have learned something. . And from a lot of
others, too.

But my sense that senses injustice is just too hyperactive (not paranoid,
but the difference is trivial here). It just works that way. Got me into
trouble before, I expect it will again. I manage it by gardening and
keeping to the side of things. And that's where I need to be. I cannot be a
good member of this working family. I could not trust myself to do that. It
began with a name and what's in it. A name that was a good one. And an
intrusion into that name. You know, I imagined I'd come back on the list
and somebody would ask me, "well red slider, would you like to introduce
yourself to us?" and I'd thought maybe I'd post a little piece that I did
that tells about the fog horns and a little school stuff and some of San
Franscisco where I grew up. It felt right because it felt like I could
share some initmacy and keep my privacy. But that didn't happen. I tried to
keep the first post lite - in the ballpark. But the next came too quick. I
don't know why I'm saying all this. Maybe I figure I owe you bigtime but
this is all I've got. some words. well the name is shit for me now. I made
it so. Not anyone here. Nothing to do for that. I'm not whining about it
either. hate whining. I got insensed, thats all. and in the list, out of
the list - that's not the place i want to be. I'd of hoped someone figured
out I don't get insensed for myself - never felt personally attacked by
anyone - not even some of the direct bck chnl explosions i caught along the
way. Just that there was somthing wrong out somewhere and it was comin up
through me like a freight train.

I'll be going now. And no personal messages please. I need to take care of
me now. Well this list is not a confessional or a couch - that's for sure.
So without further embarrassment, so long.

Yeah, but Mark, NONE of those were on NPR stations, let alone on a program
produced by NPR for national distribution.

Community stations are great and the few small independent networks (are
there really any others besides Pacifica) tend to be good, though everyone
I know who lives in a town with a Pacifica station complains about how
they've deteriorated.

NPR, as a network is just like the commercial stations, far too much of an
interest in market share, etc. to program anything that isn't relatively
official culture.  Which doesn't mean there aren't NPR afiliates with local
programs that are very good, but the national feed is relatively safe,
especiallyu on the cultural front.

Bests,

there is one of the Tankgirl series of comic books(should I say
graphic novels)  which is based on _Ulysses_ (titled I think 'the
Odyssey') -- it opens with a morning shaving scene, and follows the
rough outline of the novel, it is fun as a response to _Ulysses_ but
seems to get bored with the idea part of the way through;


p.s. I'll be glad when the Red Slider issue ends (nothing against any
of the participants) (perhaps it can be reworked in graphic format,
certainly the range of science-fiction/conspiracy theory references
would suit the genre -- to whom will be assigned the role of the Dark
Knight?

When _Leningrad_ was published, there were actual negotiations for awhile
betwixt Mercury House's PR folks and NPR. Ditto with The Atlantic. Tho all
for nought, as it happened.

Because of the "reach" that such institutions have, you can imagine that
there are a gazillion folks trying to get through to Terri every day. So it
ends up with a hefty moat around it and frankly the places with the
experienced PR agents would indeed be the likely ones to get across the
bridge. No conspiracy theory needed.

Ms. Gross, of course, is an alum of the very same English Dept that sponsors
this list...

Spicer's Pacifica show was on folk music, not poetry and ran in something
like the 1949-52 time frame. The tapes of him I've heard from the SF State
Archive would take more than a little remastering to make audible.

Clark Coolidge did a great show on KPFA for awhile in the late 1960s,
followed by another by David Gitin. Clark's was basically the NY School, and
David's basically the Black Mtn folks. Later Kit Robinson and Erica Hunt did
a series called In the American Tree (from which I took a title), later
hosted by others as well. Jack Foley more recently has had a show on that
station.

Barry Cox, long a lurker on this list, passed away yesterday from cancer.

Of all the poets who turned to the computer industry for employment, Barry was
arguably the most successful. His projects as CIO of BBDO-West, the ad firm,
were the subject of articles in publications like Information Week.

Like a lot of poets, he didn't try to publish, though he attended readings in
the Bay Area much more often than do most of the folks in the Palo Alto area.

As an expert on American paranoia (also known as a version of the sublime
trauma of this polity), I have finally figured out this "Red
Slider"/"Charles Bernstein" affair.  It turns out that (with his vast
listserve expertise on a farm in Pennsylvania near Amish country), "Red
Slider" is actually a hook or alias for "Ron Silliman," who is acting out
his displaced rage against "Charles Berstein" (all due to the dialectics
of LP agon as narrated by Bob Perelman in  Marginal Poetics), but "Charles
Bernstein" in this case is being played by Robert Pinsky who is not just
satisfied to by US poet laureate but actually wants some playing time as
manager of the Listserv (in other words wants to become "Listmaster" of
that poetry enclave in Buffalo before its gets too big).  So Silliman is
feeling a bit more marginalized these days, yes, a bit more like Jack
Spicer and proud of it and loving life in that bar/computer office.  I
arrived at this bad allegory by reading Joe Amato's wondrous new SUNY
Press book, "Bookend" which is really about "anatomies of the virtual
self" and the deviousness of all stable signatories (the book, a scholarly
studies, actually dissolves in lettrist emptines and typos at the end).  I
suspect this book was written by John Cage or Marshall Mcluhan.
I will end this bad allegory of the devious signatory in virtual space (I
for one am Robocop in Christchurch mean to runin the mind of Denise
Dutton), with a quote from that underrated poet, Peter Handke:
Mercenaries had strayed
into the language and occupied
every word
blackmailed each other
by using
concepts as passwords
and I became more and more speechless

and stopped working the time warps of those "cultural journals" and litte
poetry magazines.
This may be Rob Wilson, but I am not "Red Slider" who is "Red Slider" and
works on a farm.
No offense intended to my fellow paranoids and marginal subjects.

I'm with you, Patrick.  The idea of a poetry/architecture relation intrigues me
though. With all that stone & at that great height, and with so much at stake
(like the NASA program of its time), & here were these architects weighing
what had been done & creating elegant & viable "solutions".  Gehry's doing it
today with his titanium walls.  Is there a way of reading poetry for its
weight and heft & transparency - a way of measuring it - and providing
deliberate alternatives?  Of course, this is how it's done all the time.
But this assumes a certain sobriety about each undertaking... does it sound
like poetry anymore?  Henry mumbled...  Imagine imagination which includes
PLAN... (the Hefty Formalists?)

Barry was someone I admired greatly. He was extremely quiet but his keen
observations were always a thrill. He had also been a long time follower of
poetry and one of those poetry regulars so vital to the viability of a
series, book, or magazine - a supporter of poetry in every sense of the
word. I spent a good deal of time with Barry in Vancouver and most recently
in Buffalo for the Duncan festival. He loved the word and was a devoted
reader. He was present during the formative stages of some West Coast
poetries and I believe he had also been a student of Robin Blaser's in
Vancouver. He was also someone who travelled regularly, backcountry Mexico
being one of his haunts. My favorite stories of his were his recollections
of readings of Ron, Charles, and others, early on. Getting an additional
perspective on some of the published accounts. It seemed to me he had such
an important perspective, was sitting there at the beginning, and through
many significant moments. His keen state of sweet, studied, quiet
observation, almost buddhist in nature, is something that I will always
remember. As I will his respectfulness for people and his unstoppable,
affectionate awe of the word. Though Barry wasn't widely known, he was
significant among us; we have certainly lost a part of where we have been by
losing someone who never failed to be with us.

There's still good radio in Austin (or was, as of when I left two months
ago). KUT, the NPR affiliate, has poets as guests on several shows, most
notably the morning-midafternoon show, Eklektikos, and some of the
overnights. And there are several shows with poets (on an erratic
schedule) on KOOP, the indie station (which, while it carries Pacifica
news, isn't a Pacifica station). They tend not to be adventurous, since
they're mostly made up of local poets (who tend to be surprisingly
conservative), bit it's something...

mulling over th embers of the latest conflaguration as they dim down,
this latest eruption over how the list operates...  certainly there's
concern over real/imagined abuses ov power that might "moderate" what
we imagine is a free & equal exchange...  but ov course thee list, as
a social entity, is constantly moderating itself, and each ov us is a
moderator...  the effusive and lauditory thankyous & agreements that
greet th postings of one ov our more famous listmembers, or the silences
that greet notes that are seen as naive or uninformed...  not to mention
ov course the sarcastic or vitrolic retorts that regularly fly thru
these mailboxes, nor the friendly banter that publicly marks various
subgroups as allies...  i'm not suggesting that these dynamix are evil
or shd be "fixed"--only that they have real power to control participation,

Subject:      Call for essays

Ed Foster has asked me to post the following (please do not respond
to the below to me but rather directly to Ed--if his e-mail is
working then the address would be: efoster@vaxc.stevens-tech.edu).

TALISMAN is currently preparing a collection of essays tracing the
history of innovative American poetry from the 1970s to the present.
The essays will be published in a double issue of the journal (#20-21,
Winter/Spring 1999) and simultaneously as a book, both in paper and
cloth.

We are looking for poets, scholars, and critics who would be willing to
prepare essays of 4,000-6,500 words for the book.  Essays  could deal with
an individual figure if her/his work can be seen as representative of a
particular aesthetic or a certain group of poets, but we would be more
interested in essays with a general focus.  About twenty writers are at
present preparing essays for the project, but many important areas are not
yet covered--e.g., gay poets, Hispanic poets, small publishers and little
magazines (an essay on L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E and related journals has already
been assigned, however).

If you would like to take part in this project, please write, as soon as
possible, to the editors, Joseph Donahue and Edward Foster, at Talisman,
P.O. Box 3157, Jersey City, NJ 07303-3157; or call (201) 938-0698; or
fax (201) 938-1693.

The deadline is October 6.

I certainly don't know his views on performance
poetry per se. But I'm not so certain
Pinsky is against the performance aspect of
poetry. He reads with vigor and gusto--seems to
truly enjoy his own readings as performance.
I've heard him describe poetry as a function of
the body--the control of and exhalation of
"a column of air" rising out of one's body.

I believe, in hearing him speak, that Pinsky
is open-minded to alternative poetries. Poetries
outside his vein. Also, he did a good job of countering
(see below, from NYT OpEd, I believe ) Richard Howard's
small-minded address--RH expressing his desire
to keep poetry a secret society--to PEN (reprinted
in the April issue of Harpers).

As for NPR, I know that a Katherine Bowman
does periodic segments featuring a single poet.
I get the impression she's trying to cover the map
of what contemporary poetry is in the U.S. (But
maybe her map is missing a few precincts.)
Has anyone, of langpo or postmod sector, tried
to contact her, sent her a book or tape? Had
any response?

The People's Verse By Robert Pinsky

Should poetry be on the Internet? Should it have a month, like cheese or
Vaccination Awareness? No, say critics like the sage and distinguished poet
Richard Howard, citing the inner, personal nature of the art. This is a
sympathetic position, but I differ. Poetry is part of our shared, communal
life, as surely as is the Internet.
The conventional notion is that technology and poetry are opposites, but
poetry is itself a technology: an ancient technology that uses the human
body. Like the digital computer, verse is a memory system; a means of storing
information that can be called up with great speed, compactly.
The bodily technology of verse allowed the griots of Alex Haley's "Roots" to
recite historical records: long genealogies, dynasties, property rights.
This ability to extend a process seems to be part of our genetic makeup, a
link between voice and cognition. After all, when someone tells you their
phone number, you mutter it aloud because vocalizing it helps your brain
remember it. This patterning by vocal repetition is similar to what musicians
call "getting it under your fingers" or athletes call "body knowledge."
Certain patterns enter the mind through repetition in the body.
Written poetry in English came long before prose. By a similar principle, it
is not hard to imagine that poetry -- a code of expression based on the
expressive and (I assume) rhythmic grunts made by a resourceful mammal --
preceded other forms of language.
Relatively disembodied language that uses its own vocal quality only in a
diluted or feeble way, at many removes from the body, may be a rather recent
development in evolutionary time.
Our species' development of sophisticated technologies like the computer
extends our primate ancestors' development of rhythmic, meaningful
vocalizations.
The word poet comes from the Greek for "maker," and poetry has served as a
mighty taproot of an intellectual as well as a spiritual kind. There appears
to be a link between the creative power of imagination and the power of what
might be called "mumbo jumbo" -- a place where formal intensity and opacity
overlap. That is, to conceive of something new seems to be linked to an
intimate sense of the mysterious -- something that is not immediately
reducible to paraphrase.
The ability to make new discoveries is related to another sensation that is
part of the vocal patterning associated with poetry: the pleasure taken in
language that is only partly understood.
Why is the maiden all forlorn? Why is the priest all shaven and shorn? Why
does he marry her to a man who is tattered and torn? Because it rhymes (so we
remember it) -- but maybe also because she is pregnant? We don't know. But
wondering about such questions feels to me like a fundamental aspect of
intelligence.
Our development of a highly sophisticated culture, one in which many workers
delight in solving difficult problems and handling vast amounts of
information, depends on an elaborate, ancient substructure -- the billion
accidents and intentions that underlie every word. From this perspective,
designating April as National Poetry Month might seem as absurd as having a
month for Our Genetic Heritage.
Yet it is a very good idea just the same.
For poetry isn't only bodily, it is also civic.
Poetry month and the posting of short poems on subway cars may violate some
notion of the form's intimate quality. But the civic space is where language
and makers live.
 In the 17th century, poets -- some of them great ones -- wrote poems
flattering royalty and toadying up to rich, eminent patrons. That was part of
the civic life of art, a part of the way that society held onto the art of
poetry, thereby preserving it for the unborn.
That process of preserving this treasure was more organic than overt. It was
part of the social process: The king wanted some high-grade flattery and the
poet wanted what the king had to give.
Because of that civic exchange, those people, all now dead, kept alive a
treasure for us. Incidentally, the exchange might have sharpened the makers'
sense of reality, making clear all the silliness and imperfections of their
times, and of themselves.
As to the imperfections of our time and ourselves, Richard Howard may be
right to remind us that the art of poetry is inward, and not limited to April
(which is also Soy Products Month). But the art is also outward, part of the
marketplace where we all gather.

        Henry,
        Gehry's work has at least one immediate effect, and that seems to
be a wistful fun-house mirror effect.  In that, the surrounding landscape,
or city-scape, is emulated and mocked at the same time.  So, I think you
draw a vivid analogy, the ends left open, and the dogma replaced by
discourse.  I wonder, despite what is normally taken for the author/reader
function, their respective roles, if subcunscious intent (PLAN) guides one
through the writing/reading/(even) theorizing experience (IMAGINATION).
On these terms, imagination and intent are inseperable.  "Objective
Chance"?

While I cannot claim to understand the whole Red Slider thing fully and I
should have kept out of it in the first place (when I was in Buffalo last
week Charles mentioned to me that he was writing to RS re: pseudonyms) I
cannot resist commenting on a particular vein of this flurry of responses
which I find problematic--the way the issues quickly break down into moral
defenses of the parties involved.  "Red Slider is a good human/cyber being
and therefore he's a martyr" vs. "Charles works very hard and therefore
it's sinful to criticize him."  People take sides as if defending political
candidates--or nations, and I think all nationalism is fascist.  But that's
just my narrow vision.  Having been on the receiving end of such attacks
this summer over my critique of the Sun & Moon contests--where the logic
was S&M published lots of important books and its editor was therefore
beyond examination, I felt like I was criticizing God or something.  I felt
no one on the list would look at my detailed listing of my personal
experiences, and though I got lots of backchannel and phone support, no one
dared to publically show compassion towards me on the list.  I felt bitter,
very bitter.  And then later in the summer there was the passionate defense
of the pornographic babes/attack on right-wing Dodie . . .  forever will I
think of myself as the queen of "rhetorical violence".  I felt bitter-er
still.

Red Slider's lucky he has so many friends here, but that doesn't mean that
he's automatically the victim of some Kafka-esque conspiracy.

I'm sure Charles works hard and that he's a great human being, but that
doesn't mean he's above scrutiny either.

I was reading about the "fantasy of objectivity" this morning in a great
anthology, _Freakery: Cultural Spectacles of the Extraordinary Body_,
edited by Rosemarie Garland Thomson.  It's interesting (and maddening) how
this fantasy of objectivity occasionally breaks down on the Poetics List
into emotional hysteria.  I suppose, in the bigger picture, that's a good
thing.  It shows us where the seams are.

Plan & imagination in a relation comparable to chance and necessity - that
is a reciprocal or maybe mirror image.  What appears fortuitously is what
is at hand - i.e., the necessary materials.  But language is so overloaded
with SOCIAL "architecture" (human experience) that to talk about poetry in
terms of wood & stone seems pretty abstract, I'm sure. (Not that poets haven't
tried to "objectify" it in various ways... maybe that's what we're doing.)
Yeats used to write out a prose "abstract" of the poems he wanted.  A plot.
This is a way of getting at what I meant about being deliberate & responsible
for every element.  Not that it's the only way!! As you said, lazy writing
takes many forms... for some, a prose trot would be the best way to kill a poem
& internet chatting is probably the ultimate form of lazy writing! - HG

p.s. but perhaps the ultimate laziness is the above equation: chance =
necessary materials.  "localism", "confessionalism", "aleatory techniques",
"serial form", "documentary realism", etc. - all roughly equivalent! Valorizing
whatever's ready to hand.  - Henry G.

        And this leads up to the point I was trying to gather the guts to

interview with Allen Ginsberg (in connections withe the SELECTED

        Henry,

        What's at hand is the pith of the thing, the raw, unalloyed
materials.  In my own case (since I can't speak fairly of every case),
this raw "stuff" on the workbench has lost its value at first touch, and
the job of the poet is to create a valuable and artificial conglomeration
of grime.  's dirty job and stemming from a perhaps crude exploitation of
the materials, but aleatory techniques call for bravery and genuine
crafts___ship, and will brook no laziness.  There is the aleatory and then
there is the technique.  Just as there is something to confess away and
apart from the confession.

Yes, I agree--he does seem passionate in delivery. But that he puts a lot
into his own performance does not mean that he's down with performance
poetry. I should have included more of the frame of Terri's question,
which was 'how do you feel about performace poetry, which is so poular
today, and relies on rhythm and sound more than the meaning of the words'
(that's a paraphrase; 'meaning of the words' is a crappy way to put what
she said, but you get the idea?, it was a "content" issue). That's when
Pinsky said "well I'm not *against* [performance poetry]." And he went on
to say that a poetics that foregrounds rhythm and sound is not tapping
into/not creating the most *profound* poetry.

I am no Pinsky expert, and I'm willing to trust that in some cases he has
displayed an interest in alternative poetry. But all of the exposure I
have had to him says otherwise. That wasn't really the point of my
original post, anyway, though, I only wanted to share a line by him that I
thought was *very* funny.

Thanks for sharing the piece on where poetry should be by Pinsky.
Certainly it is always good to read about openness to all mediums. My
concern though was *what* poetry should be (according to Pinsky), but
maybe I've caught him on days when he was feeling particularly narrow.

I thought the Bromige-ized Anecdote of the Jar was spectacular.

From a technical point of view, Gerard Malanga has a lot of poems using a
similar method, the example that comes to mind is "To a Young Heiress"
which comes from Frank O'Hara's "To The Harbormaster"

Paraphrase and appropriation, essential tools

FYI: have just received a call for papers from the Association of Caribbean
Studies.  The conference will be held in Cartagena, Columbia, July 25-31,
1998.  Abstracts of 200-300 words, double-spaced, may be sent to:

Conference Coordinator
Association of Caribbean Studies
P.O. Box 22202
Lexington, KY   40522-2202

Abstracts must be submitted in triplicate before April 30, 1998.  Speakers
will be limited to 15 minutes.  (That does seem a long way to go for
fifteen minutes of time on the agenda, but maybe it's worth it to hear the
rest of the conference?)  It says here that "almost" all papers are
delivered in English.

Subject:      Re: Try again Charles - this is exactly how it came to me

it was never a matter of personal loyalties -- i've never met charles.  but
i can appreciate both ends having been assistant listmaster on pretty large
list for awhile, and having had my own bout of sulks and paranoia the first
time the list had a slowdown.

and i can also approach this historically, having watched over the years a
number of people with varyingly colorful computer problems wrestling with
subscriber problems both here and on other list i helped care for.

no one has ever approached it with the shotgun aimed at listmaster and
stalin-era-like level of paranoia of this last bout.  i've never seen anyone
try to get a listmaster fired because the list program cut them due to
address problems (and recall, red slider bragged several times about having
gone to the head of EPC, charles' and list's presumed "bosses" over his
deletion).  finally, i've not seen anyone so patently ignore corrections of
a misreading as ws done mr. slider, nor make such a loud fuss when asked if
in compliance with stated rules of list, and if not, to get in compliance.
slider knew this was NOT an anonymous/pseudonymic list when he joined -- it is
all over the welcome and subscriber messages.

being a listmaster is one of the most frustrating and thankless and laborious
tasks on earth, increased exponentially if you are only a moderately to slightly
knowledgeable computer type.  i am extremely impressed charles et alia managed
to even LOAD listserv program!  i never dared try, only help once my computer
wonk friend had loaded and set parameters.  if someone thought up an extremely
helpful and wonderful way to set up a virtual community, invited me into it,
did the mountains of boring tedious maintenance tasks necessary to keep it
going, fixed the innumerable problems brought on by computer complications,
remained cheerful and helpful throughout, and did this all with a minimum of
computer sophistication, and all GRATIS, out of just their "good poetry
citizen" ethos, well, it is beyond grotesque to imagine trying to get them
fired and the list shut down because 1) i had inadvertantly cut off by a
computer glitch;  2) i was asked if i was in compliance with a clearly
stated policy and asked, if i wasn't, to bring myself into compliance.
at least in my corner of the world, one thanks people when they do kind and
extraordinary things for one, not attacks.

what on EARTH is going on when anyone would do such a thing, and anyone
would defend it?!  we all know charles and gang, all participate in their
kindness and generosity and all of us benefit from their hard work.  if
there is reason to think a policy is less than ideal, at the very least,
don't you think polite and private discussion with charles, with perhaps
non-name-calling, non-accusatory, open discussion that is mindful of charles
as the poor schmuck who will have to implement anything suggested is in order?

again, i, for one, would eschew insistance (and who the hell would i be to
insist charles do ANYTHING given that i haven't done piss-anything to start,
maintain, or build this list?) about any technical aspect of list maintenance
unless i accompanied it with cheerful offer to roll up my sleeves and wade
through grut and tons of computer persiflage and documentation accompanying
anything to do with programs.

Oh, Bromige's red rim eyeglasses are famous. When we read the four-author
novel _Piccolo Mondo_ at the Western Front in Vancouver more than a year
ago, David handed out red-rim glasses to all the authors. That was the
poetical fashion statement of the Northwest for the Nineties.

Interested to see Philip Whalen in a "Younger Poets" issue. Younger than
what--Methuselah? My god, even _I_ could have qualified under these
less-than-rigorous guidelines....probably I was informed of it, but forgot.
Why, even Tom Clark & Joanne Kyger gave up white ankle sox last year. I
like chutzpah! Sign me up for a copy. "Younger than Springtime..." Ed Dorn
doing the lead. If you're "Young at Heart", "fairy tales can come true."
And thats what poetry is all about, dammit. I dont understand all this
kerfuffle about fictional names. Once a younger poet, always a younger
poet. Ask me later, years later, I'm indestructible. But I'm not NY
School/Naropa--isnt _that_ more the focus here? David

There's an earlier precedent for the Bromige method; Kenneth Koch and John
Ashbery's collaboration, "A Servant to Servants", begins "With a wooden
lead-filled writing implement Jeeves wrote, 'What sudden showers',/And
warm sunlight came flooding in the wood-framed glass aperture that Beulah
had opened/For Alice B. Toklas. A mucus-filled bone construction in the
middle of her face reacted angrily to the profusion of orange blossoms."

The TLS had a spectacular review of the Rose/Joyce Ulysses a few weeks
back, a review that concluded periodless and which included a bravura
catechetical section. It's been the TLS, actually, where most of the
significant fussing between editor and executor has gone on. Sales of
Berard's Odyssee have not jumped. Nor apparently has Larbaud's
translation.

More pointless erudition: I heard that W Stevens' poems (soon to be issued
in Library of America gorgeous deluxe format?) were written by a drunken
sailor. Speaking of asleep in their boots: I ducked out of St Marks this
morning at 6:45 to avoid the round robin conclusion of the all night
reading of On the Road. The part I heard, from 3:45 on, had Dean stealing
cars, landing Sal and the jesuit boys in a ditch, everybody eyeing dames
and saying 'damn' softly, and of course, spodie-odie. Standout readers
included the great Dug Rothschild scurrying up to the podium shoeless and
in an unbuttoned work shirt, assembling his outfit (and creasing his
fedora) as he read the bit about getting out of town before the angry mob
of high school boys came to get Dean for flinging pebbles at the local
beauty's window, the incomparable Ted Greenwald laughing at something,
a lady assistant whose name I forget doing a lovely reading of Sal
flirting with a woman in a low-cut cotton blouse, Sharon Mesmer banging
the podium (and saying 'ow'), David Vogen accelerating maniacally for one
of Dean's less lucid moments, Johnny Stanton mentioning that he had seen
Neal Cassady himself change a tire on 10th betw B & C, agh, I forget who
else, it was early! But the Financial Times shows up at Gem Spa at 3 am,
which is good to know, that and Sandy Weill has a neon sign outside his
office which like a hotel sign announcing vacancy or no declares him
'happy' or 'not happy'.

Uh, David, I think it's called "younger poets" because it used to be in a
very copyright-infringing way called "Yale Younger Poets." So you see,
it's, uh, well, a joke -- albeit a New York School/Naropa joke, which
means that unlike a Language Poetry joke, you won't find it in The
Economist ...

by the way, looking very forward to your reading at Poetry City with Alan
Sondheim --

speaking of the list mechanics--I'm assuming I get a service unavailable
message regarding odin of the cairn and the cross because I'm a new york

convert at least that name's box to nomail until the owner comes back?

HOT, HOT, HOT off the presses next week,
for all you fanatics of the really late Henry Gould [don't everybody write

CYCLOBIOGRAPHY, by Henry Gould
Providence: AlephoeBooks, 1997
144 pp. poifectly bound
$13.50 ($12. & shipping) to: The Poetry Mission, PO Box 2321, Providence, RI

A collection of semi-bent narrative poems in Henry's trademark
beat-byzantine [or b-squared] style.

Now a few words from the In-the-Know Crowd [hot off the espresso mute bar]:

"Already an underground classic.  I buried mine yesterday and opened all the
windows."   - Jack Spandrift

"C'mon Jack, you can do better than that.  Want to borrow my Princeton
Encyclopedia of Toney Poetic Blurbs?"  - Henry Gould

"His management of the keyboard of American slang lexicon (what is Rhode
Island, anyway?) is sure to gratify, wouldn't you say, every one of his
many admirers?"  - Eric Blarnes

"Yo, babe! Hot shit!  The dude's no jayhawk!"  - Helen Vendler

"If Wystan and I were still alive, we would certainly be reading this book.
Thank our lucky stars, at our present spiritual abode we can just
dip directly into it now and then."  - James Merrill

"No comment."  - Robert Pinsky

"No comment." - Rita Dove

"Any more comments?" - Henry Gould

"At last! A Man for our Times!" - Princess Louisa Fortinblatt-Hohenzollern,
Duchess of Grand Fenwick & VIP-Spankin'-Regent of Turkustan-Stufflings

"Henry who?" - John Berryman

"If you read one book this year... oh, forget it." - Marian the Librarian

"Hey everybody, this guy is really cool.  I was reading this just today
at Gimme No Lip & spilled mocha java all over it.  Have you tried their
coffee?  It's better than Blend To Death's.  Did you see Lena there
yesterday?  She wasn't in class all last week.  Jason said she went to
New York..."   - Joe College

Don't I remember Lyn doing that show first, Ron? I mean before Kit and

As someone who can barely manage to 'open' my own computer & get through to
read this list each day, I have to say Thanks Eliza, youre absolutely right
that Charles et al have done great service to us all -- so Thanks to them
all for such service. (On the other hand, I seem to have missed the deep
problems rs caused, although I can understand why he was asked the question
re his name. I have to say I wasnt bothered by his postings even if I wasnt
moved to respond to any myself, but I do think the various advice to him re
checking things out about possible 'technical' problems seemed reasonable.
Sorry in a way that he wont be here, but glad that here continues to be...

Mike and Dale's Younger Poets is indeed a play on the Yale Younger Poets
Series.  At least, that's how it started.  The first issue was in fact
titled, simply, Yale Younger Poets.  Then it became Dale's YP. We've
called it Mike and Dale's since issue 4.

We happen to include any poet we love in these issues, hence the
paradoxical contents.  Which shouldn't be too troubling, really, to
understand as poets.  The magazine is also about listening to those who
have contributed to this art before us.  Whether it's NY school, SF
renaissance, or black mountain doesn't matter. We're autocratic and take
what we like.  I guess by that you can tell what we don't like.

The Radio Reading Project

In 1992, Rosanne Limoncelli and myself produced five radio programs of poets
in performance, all of them followed by short interviews. The programs were
produced and directed by Rosanne and myself and our sound engineer at the
time was Claudia Cummings.  The recordings were made at New York University,
Tisch School of the Arts, during the winter of 1992-93.  Each program lasted
close to 56 minutes and where edited to be broadcasted in actual radio as
part of an ongoing archival project.  In the beginning our hope was that the
programs would become available through satellite.  At the time we didn't
know of the possibilities of the WWW neither of the soon to be Electronic
Poetry Center, since then three of those radio programs became available
through the EPC (http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/sound/file-list-html), Hannah
Wiener's, Jackson Mac Low's and Charles Bernstein's.  The other two
recordings (Robert Creeley's and Susan Howe's) are awaiting to be put on
line.  Last week Rosanne started to transfer those programs from reel to
reel to a digital format in order to offer the best possible sound quality.
In spite of the extended editing, recordings were in some cases half an hour
longer that the actual final 56 minutes cut, I believe that they preserved
the tone of each meeting.

Dale,

Judging from the writers you listed for this issue of your mag, what you
guys like is straight white men.  For example, I counted 22 poets and 2
interviewees, for a total of 24 contributors, only four of which were
women.  I think that even The New American Poetry did better than that.

I hate PC-mongers myself, but still . . .

Rempress is a small poetry press and organiser of reading series, based in
Cambridge, UK. It is run by Lucy Sheerman and myself. We have published
and will be publishing some pamphlets which may be of interest to
people in the States. We now have a US distributor, SPD, which will make
it much easier to get hold of these pamphlets.

Beth Anderson           The Impending Collision
                        ISBN No 1 901 361 02 0

Both these poets are intellectually passionate and accomplished.
And for list completion's sake the third pamphlet out is:

Karlien van den Beukel  Pitch Lake

Out soon will be the following pamphlets:

Fiona Templeton  Oops the Join
Tracy Ryan       Slant

Kevin Killian, long-time Small Press Traffic volunteer, has manfully
volunteered to be the opening act for our UK visitor.  His 1997 books are
Little Men (Hard Press), Arctic Summer (Hard Candy) and the new Argento
Series (Meow Books), which collects many of the poems he has written over
the past few years on the intertwined topics of HIV and the films of the
Italian horror maestro Dario Argento.  With Lew Ellingham Killian has
written the life of the US poet Jack Spicer which Wesleyan University Press
will publish in the spring.  =B3Five Years in the Life of Jack Spicer=B2 has
recently appeared in the Impercipient Lecture Series, and another excerpt
from this biography will appear in Chicago Review in December.  He is
thrilled to return to Canessa Park at last.

Sorry to use up a message on the List fopr further e-ddress info....can
someone tell me, is there a directory of some kind i might access for this
stuff? Meanwhile, if anyone has an e-ddress for Don Byrd--or for Victor
Coleman, see yesterday's posting by me--please b-c me with that info.

While I'm eating up a message unit anyway, I might as well say thanks to
those who posted in with info re "Younger Poets." My posting re that was
dumb. I dont understand half of it myself. I had had 3 vodka tonics. Must
remember not to turn computer on when swacked.

But in this connection, I would like to repeat what Randolph Healy wrote,
when I had told him, some months ago, I had had 3 vodka tonics the night
before : "What self-control--that you could stop!"

As you may deduce, if getting drunk is a newsworthy event in my piccolo
mondo, its what i seldom do. And today, I know why.  David

Subject:      Re: The Name & the Paradox of its Contents
Content-Type: text/plain

Dodie:

Thanks for exposing the obvious injustice.  As you can imagine, Hoa and
I have discussed the very issues you yourself raise.  And I would like
to open this up to others on the list with more experience editing
magazines than myself.  The dilemma, as I see it, is twofold:  1) how do
you publish poetry you love and 2) still represent poets of diverse
backgrounds?  My small format allows me hardly 90 pages of space to work
with, so I'm naturally going to be selective about how I fill that up.
Also, my friends who write the poetry I like, happen to be predominately
white and male.  I prefer friends' work to strangers.  But I don't limit
it in that way.  I publish plenty of people who I don't know personally.
But there's no way I can do a search of all the women and people of
color writing poetry in this country.  I have neither the means nor the
time for that kind of investigation.  Nor, frankly, the interest.
Luckily, in this country I can be concerned with issues of aesthetics.
Which for me, these days, is as troubling as racial and sexual equality.
But then again, I'm not, on a daily basis, openly confronted with
inequities of race or gender because I am a white man.  I would be
ashamed to admit otherwise and ashamed to condescendingly ask for work
from women or people of color just to satisfy some personal need of
pan-sexual/racial representation in order to prove that, hey, I'm really
a nice guy.  Look.  I published this poem by...  I do know several
female poets, but fewer writers of color.  Of the women I know, I have
invited only those whose work I admire and want for my magazine.  It
seems the others send their poems to Chain, where they can stay, as far
as I'm concerned, from an aesthetic position.  My poetics, if you
haven't noticed, is deeply influenced by NY school, black mountain
poets, etc. Pound,in a deeper way, influences my decisions.  Most
writers outside of my small camp follow a deplorable tradition of
poetics established by Gertrude Stein's self narcissim.  It's simply not
my thing, yet that kind of poetics proliferates and is condoned by many
people.  Judging from the invitations Hoa receives to submit poetry to
various journals, I assume that there are plenty of established venues,
with at least some corporate/academic funding, open to the aesthetic
style I detest.  But Hoa's poetry is actually quite good, so those
editors are lucky to be getting it.  But, because there are so few poets
of color writing experiemental poetry and so many white editors
demanding such work, Hoa actually questions the aesthetic value of her
poems.  I feel, however, that most poetics journals these days seek
women and people of color to satisfy a self-righteous urge to compete in
the cultural market place, regardless of personal poetics.  And editors
who do not draw a line over aesthetic concerns, in the end, ruin
thought, intellection, and in a deeper way, the very issues they
themselves falsly believe they are confronting.  Because, honestly, a
great deal of poetry is dull as hell these days.  Both men and women are
contributing to that.  All patronizing attempts to include the other
will continue to expand this inanity.  But now we are discussing
aesthetics, which is tricky, and will take us nowhere. You will see what
you have to and I will do what I must.  Meanwhile, compared to something
like Chain, or even Mirage, M&D's must seem quite unfashionable.

Yours,
Dale

Dale,

You've dug yourself in so deep, I feel like offering you a shovel . . .

I feel that women and writers of color have, more often than not, given the
most thrilling readings at Small Press Traffic over these many years.  My
"thought" and "intellection" may have been ruined long ago, but I've never
booked anybody whose work I didn't believe in--and yes I've had to
research, to fill in my lacunae--but I think the results, both personally
and publically, have been well worth it.

Why is it that "aesthetics" always comes to the rescue of any attempt to
broaden one's scope by including writers of color and women, as if there
were some "natural" division between them?  I know I've solicited material
from members of both "groups," and not because I felt it an either/or
question; it would be an act of bad faith were I not to do so.  And why is
it that the mysterious category of "my friends" is always the one holding
the aesthetical torch?  I appreciate the desire not to make too many
distinctions, but the refusal to make any (or to insist that only others
are doing so) only supports the status quo.  And is not "experimentalism"
an attempt to change the status quo?  Or should only some quo's be
re-statused?

Right friggin' on! I havent got time for all those 800pp novels and 300pp
poems. If those writers had something to say, let 'em say it quickly. It's
not like there's nothing else to do but read a novel by James Joyce. We
have more and more books around now; we dont have to fill up our reading
time. Give me James Joyce on two cassettes and I';ll listen to them on the
way to work.

points well taken on both sides here, tho i will add two cents along the
lines of what dale was saying abt the profusion of journals out there.

some of the editorial work for the journal sub-stance has recently moved
from santa barbara here to london ont.  for a few years now the number of
submissions dealing with issues of gender/race/identity have, very sadly,
dropped off, a simple reason being that there are any number of
specialized journals now that cover those areas.  which is of course a
good thing, except that now a readership that appreciates a broad range of
perspectives can no longer easily find that range in one place, and
readerships get fragmented, balkanized.

perhaps that fragmentation is more accurate reflection of the status quo,
and i certainly wdnt advocate a return of the evil empire.  but in the
meantime, what's an editor to do?  broaden horizons do some work and hunt
down a range of perspectives, hellyeah.  publish stuff you don't like for
the sake of being "representative," noway.

publish stuff you like -- and keep looking for new stuff to like.


cheers,
tom

David Gitin actually still does (or at least did as of a year ago) a radio
program, although it comes out of Monterey area. No poetry, or very little.
More a music program. He still generates about a chapbook a year of
poems...

Dale writes (among other things):

1) how do you publish poetry you love and 2) still represent poets of diverse
backgrounds?  My small format allows me hardly 90 pages of space to work
with, so I'm naturally going to be selective about how I fill that up.
Also, my friends who write the poetry I like, happen to be predominately
white and male.


Dale:  Not to sound condescending, but you need to make more friends.  Or
to spin it another way, all you have to do is ask.  If you get bad Gertrude
Stein imitations, be an editor and demand better (which is your perogative
as an editor, not because you happen to be white or male).

I side with Dodie on this one.

Tom Mandel asks what David Gitin is doing. Well, after an eventful stay in
Japan after the end of his second marriage a few years ago (he was literally
hit by a truck), he's back in the Monterey area teaching at a few of JCs
around there. Publishes little chapbooks of his poetry, which I still enjoy
reading whenever I get them.

an interesting problem.  I don't think anyone is getting rich publishing
small press magazines or books, certainly it would be strange for anyone
to publish work they don't like, it also seems logical to publish your
friends' work (I would like to be friends with many of the writers whose
work I like and it certainly is hard on a friendship with a writer if you
don't like their work, though I can think of exceptions to both of these
statements without much effort).  so it seems as though on general
principles Dale is right, except that he seems to define his friends
and his taste in, not exclusionary terms, but restricted somehow.  it
would be crazy to publish something you don't like because of the gender
or race of the author*, it would be even crazier to presume you won't like
someone's writing because of their gender or race, and it seems sad but
perhaps understandable that someone lacks the curiosity or energy to seek
out writing by non-white non-males who might be interesting.  but what
can you do, Frank O'Hara said nobody should be forced to read poetry
as if it were good for you.

*(or if not crazy at least weirdly backscratching logrolling careerist)

Responding to Dale's interesting letter: I think you have to take your
"aesthetic" seriously enough to want to find it reflected where you
might not so easily recognize it, outside the writing of your buddies &
idols of the past. And see where its boundaries are with respect to
the not-obviously aesthetic, like history & personal experience & the
public world & etc.

A very brief story that might shed light on the issue: I was at a Poetry
Mission mtg last night.  Edwin Honig, a poet close to 80 who has been
through the Depression, WW II, personal McCarthyite persecution, etc.
was pushing for a reading or series of readings around Vietnam vet poets
& translations of Vietnamese poets, as a way of getting at the kind of
poetry that seems interesting & real to him: poetry of real, historical-
personal experience, of people who have "been there" in fact or authentic
imagination.  He criticized a lot of current trends as simply writing
he "doesn't understand" - abstract, inhuman, solipsistic, hermetic.
That people need poetry that addresses & interprets their own experience
of war & life's battles in a way they can feel, not in a way they have to
"appreciate" as art or technique or whatever.  [ars est celare artem]

How does this relate to your mag?  That if you are really interested
in an alternative to academic product & experimental solipsism, you
have to be less complacent about your own aesthetic & less superficial
about the grid of p.c. divisions (gender, class, race).  The issue
of when poetry loses its edge or essence & fades into doctrinaire or
documentary regurgitation is important - but that's part of your job in
looking for & finding good writing outside your own circle.

(Understand I'm preaching to myself here, as the inheritor of a little
mag  & trying in piddly ways to move MYSELF off the passive to the active
stage of finding material).

Yes indeed, Jim -- in August I stood drooling in La Hune in Paris
flipping through the 3 volumes: they definitively are the best
collection of OULIPO stuff -- cldn't however buy it as I had just come
from my favorite bookshop, the Librairie Avicenne, where I had spent
every last franc I owned buying some 2 dozen recent & not so recent
books by Maghrebian & Mashrekian poetas & writers. Next time....

i second that emotion; and i also, personally, wince at playing stein off
against pound in a way that casts stein as the narcissist, the errant one,
the one with the "problem."  to my mind, this is a gendered and politicized
determination as much as it is an aesthetic one --i.e. women are often
accused of narcissism, self-indulgence, etc and that judgment is used to
keep them from access to the renown and respect enjoyed by their male
peers.  dale, i wonder if it'd be fair to say that your aesthetic sense may
itself be the product of conditioning in an unjust society?

Maria & Susan are right on about the Pound/Stein "narcissism" tag.

I understand how disagreeable, anti-art & reactionary my previous post
sounds to many on the list.  What is art & style if not personal
interpretation & technique applied to shared reality.  For many
here experiment is an assertion of, a measure of, what is real.
But it seems to me the richest soil for poetry to grow is in a
balance - balancing the artist's interpretations & responses to
shared experience against the experience of art in and for itself.
Not art-for-arts sake or art-for-memory/experience alone (the vets).
Both at once.  Art for arts sake leads to the hermeticism & solipsism
that Honig was decrying.  Art for memorializing tough life leads to
cliche or politically-approved official art.  Doing by halves.

Hi everyone it's Kevin Killian.  My goodness, I don't think I've posted on
this list in about a million years.  Nevertheless this interesting thread
brought me out of a drug induced stupor.

I have a different perspective than the other posts I've seen, including
Dodie's.  First of all, Dale Smith's work both as poet and editor is (tho'
I haven't seen the new issue of "Mike and Dale's Younger Poets") usually
first-rate and always provocative.  There's no getting around that despite
his method.  Secondly, it's great to see a magazine with a strong editorial
policy, so many magazines come out, you read them or look at them, zzzzzz .
. . .  However Dale once you expound an editorial philosophy that flies in
the face of the orthodoxy of political correctness, you must expect or
perhaps enjoy the ensuing controversy.  Didn't the same thing happen to the
editors of "Apex of the M"?

Third, the thing I don't understand is, (I mean, the thing I don't
empathize with, is) that an editor always publishes things he or she LIKES,
what's the deal with that?  I don't buy into that, but then I'm here in
California and have the flat affectless I am a camera George Kuchar type of
mind-set.  Anyone who's read any of the issues of "Mirage #4/Period[ical]"
will know what I mean, that it's not about "fashion" in the way Dale says
but it's about what drifts in front of our bleary screen; it's more of a
diary I suppose, a document of my life and Dodie's and what happens from
week to week in our (cultural) lives . . .  I think most magazines actually
operate that way however editors are always claiming, I don't know to what
degree truly, that this is actually work they "like."  Many poets send out
their work all the time and it crosses the viewfinder of editor X or Y's
rifle and bang.  And most of these poets (the ones who send out their work
all the time) are indeed, say, 90 per cent of them, men.  Any editor will
agree with that I think.

Fourthly, I don't believe that all these editors, etc., are constantly
pursuing Hoa Nguyen for her work solely because she is a "woman of color".
If her work wasn't very, very fine she would not be in the demand you
describe.  Of course it's an interesting question.  Most sensible people
occasionally wonder about the value of their own work so I don't blame Hoa
for her doubts.

Fifthly, re: the preponderance of "straight white males" among the
contributors of the new issue of "Mike and Dale's Younger Poets" . . . I
don't know if they are all white or not but they certainly are not
uniformly "straight" . . .  Check it out, I did.

Sixthly I respect Dale's actually tireless commitment to the older poets he
admires (Clark, Dorn, Kyger, Whalen, etc.), a beautiful thing to see;
likewise his attempts, no matter how tortuous, to find a link between their
writing and history with those of the younger poets, his peers.

Seventh, I disagree, as will many others on the list, with the idea that
Gertrude Stein's poetics were deplorable or stemmed from "self narcissism."
"Condoned" is too strong a word to use in this context.

Well, there I've gone on and on about this, but forgive me, all, the issues
tempted me into speaking out a bit.  I just thought of a few anecdotes to
finish with, and one is, what is the name of that magazine that used to
come to my door every month or so, edited by that man (Ellis?) who moved to
Jerusalem or somewhere?  I'll forget my own name next, but the magazine
featured one or two poets in every issue, and after a while you just
couldn't help noticing that every one of them was a man.  This went on and
on for years.  I'd rip open the envelope and pull out the thing, and yes,
there were another couple of men blathering about this that and the other .
. .  It became amusing in this awful way.

Someone help me out here with the name of the magazine, I'm sure many of
you were in it.

The other one I remember was "Hole," this one issue came and sure enough,
there was one woman in it, and she (Karen McCormack?) was only in it
because the compositors had butchered her poem enough in a previous issue
so that the editors had to print it again in this one.  I'm sure Louis
Cabri took a lot of heat for that on both counts.

Still smarting from Luigi's description of list silence as marking an
uninformed or naive post -- well after my first few posts here I've met a
great calm -- it is, what, us? True, hurt and silence go hand in hand --
but there is also the vygotskian idea that silence is (or can be) a zone of
proximal development? that you don't make a noise while you're jumping --
you give off light -- this over and against the taoist 'who knows does not
speak' stereolab likes to sing -- since what we're speaking about is sort
of singing? If not beauty, then justice? If not justice then life itself?
If not life then the codes? If not the codes then the hollow words -- bells
are hollow. Cells are hollow. The dells are all et cetera they say but you
walk there and if you can afford it you've had a variation in your
experience. Meaning apparently is in variation, and in variation from
variation (chant, Bach, aleph, deal). And so the companies are run with an
eye to the pe ratio -- but the consolidations and the writeoffs ought to
lead to a recession? Park smells like rats. So that "I cannot make it
cohere" leads to "I will not connect the dots" but then no one does and
Plato blames writing. Poets, specifically. Money, says Frank Kermode, says
John Buchan says Wallace Stevens, is a kind of poetry. But "I cannot make
it" was Ez about money. While Stein wrote sensitively, narcissistically (!)
about it. You may not pool your money to hire a teacher to keep the
opposition from being accurate when they say classes are held in bathrooms.
You may not blame Robert Moses. Names will not do. Only learning, which is
singing. And money. Other divisions are ways to make people forgetful about
learning-singing and money. Forget money. Art did, and look where that got
it. So Gates makes up a third of what the government says it won't give
Cambridge, and this just after Rodefer gets to the states. And everybody is
happily global because the brown decades are just that. So that's what it's
like to walk to work -- Jordan

This advice reminds me of two things.  One is a Sienfeld episode where
George invites an African American man to dinner to impress his boss (a
man of color).  It also reminds me of work and m. damon's reference to
the "old boy's network" -- which I experience as the "old white
network"-- I work for a consulting firm.  Our small group has a balance
gender mix and is all European American/white.  In a meeting yesterday,
when discussing new hires, the partner (male) says "We need more
minorities!"

Having opportunities -- whether in the workplace or in getting
published-- is, well, great, for me. (I sometimes question whether it is
transformative-- economics still rule opportunities -- personally, I
feel like the kind of teaching I was lucky to do-- with inner city
youth-- created opportunities for diverse people and economically
depressed persons more than my getting printed in a magazine did.)

It is very frustrating to feel "collected" like a stuffed bird with
exotic feathers.  Some of my friends of color dislike making friends
with or participating in events with white people because as one friend
said, "I don't feel like diversifying their (group)". Mr. Steinberg's
suggestion feels like that.

I have struggled with this very much, and as Dale mentioned, we talk
about this matter constantly.  We live with it.  And I appreciate our
discussions-- and our discussions here on the list-- what is the
responsibility one has as an editor?

Also related:  Henry Gould spoke of "old idols"-- I sometimes feel as if
aestethics are meaningless and that editors often include the "big"
names regardless of what they actually are writing.

And finally, I am so tired of the reference to "sides"-- in so binary,
limiting and inaccurate to the complexities of matters at hand!  I am
not on a side, I refuse sides, which side, what is a side, who defines
the sides?

The World. Hanging Loose. Misc. Proj. No Trees.. Also, I'd say the Language
school is a metamorphosis of NY/Pound so I'd include exactly the magazines
Dale is distancing himself from in the vapor trail of that nexus. As
always, the "real critique" is elsewhere. - J

There are so many good posts already on this one but it is just too
delicious to pass up and like with Kevin, it has woken me from my
silence, the housecleaning can wait.  I think I can limit my points to
two.

1)"But, because there are so few poets
of color writing experiemental poetry"
writes Dale.  I feel ridiculous even having to point out how untrue this
is.  Of course then we get into a discussion of terms.  What we mean by
'experimental' even 'writers of color.'  But when I pulled books off my
shelf this summer to teach my "Experimental Reading & Writing" class,
this was not a problem.  Among the writers we read were Kamau
Braithwaite, Rochelle Owens, Clarke Coolidge, Susan Howe, Nicole
Brossard, Paul Beatty, Jayne Cortez, Sapphire, Beckett, Clark Coolidge,
Amiri Baraka--but then again I do tend to define things broadly.  It's
seems obvious to me that interesting language often comes from the
margin, if its not being heard, it's just not being heard.

2) I think this whole issue of picking someone just because they are a .
. .  can be laid to rest.  Only the most unimaginative and mediocre
chooser would put themselves in that position.  On the other hand why
not just assume that there is proportional quality coming out of all
sorts of bodies?  I mean just assume it's true.

In my office job I noticed that six men were the finalists for an
director position.  I blurted to my boss 'you're going to extend the
search aren't you' and he looked at me blankly. I just assume parity is
a basic issue of justice and community.  Can I use the word standard?

Thanks Maria for your comments on the Pound/Stein comment.

all yours,
RL

Well said, Maria--but this has already been said SO OFTEN . . . in the 70s
over and over and then we can swirl our heads around and look back to
Virginia Woolf.  It's disheartening that you would STILL have to be saying
it in the 90s, almost the milleniumn.  Misogyny is indeed a vile weed that
one has to continually take a sickle to.  However, when Dale wrote:

>Most
>writers outside of my small camp follow a deplorable tradition of
>poetics established by Gertrude Stein's self narcissim.

I believe that he was not just talking about women's writing in particular.
I think this is a veiled reference to Language Writing, that Dale is
carrying on his mentor Tom Clark's 20+ year vendenta against it.  Forgive
me if my interpretation is off--the passage is very vague, I wonder if not
purposely so.  Dale is quite specific in the women he condemns--that broad
highly diverse group who have been published in Chain.  Even though Chain
also prints men, we all know it's basically a women's magazine, I mean, it
may as well be Better Homes and Gardens.  But these Gertrude Stein
followers, who seem to be many gendered remain vague, veiled--I wonder if
that isn't because there is a predominance of men involved (i.e., powerful
beings to be taken seriously)--and therefore there would me a greater
degree of risk involved in openly critiquing them.

I can sympathize with Tom Clark's hatred of Language Writers.  I was living
in San Francisco when the Lang-Pos took over the scene--it was brutal and
many people were treated very badly.  But, Dale, what has anybody done to
you that you would call whatever work you have in mind "deplorable."  We
all have our likes and dislikes, but this violence of emotion is very
troubling and dangerous, I feel--especially when nobody is fighting with
you.

I'm also curious as to how you, Dale, define self-narcissism.  Is there a
narcissism that isn't "self" narcississm?  The last time I heard you read
there was lots of "I" poetry lovingly detailing your visits and
conversations with your friends.  How is that not narcissism?  I should add
that this is not a critique.  I'm very interested in narcissism.

One more thing:  from what I've seen, most writers outside of your small
camp follow a deplorable tradition of academic poetry and spoken word
poetry.  This fish bowl of "exploratory" writing (as Steve McCaffery calls
it) is very tiny.  It is not the whole world.

Dodie:

It's not surprising you want to label me a misogynist.  We've been over
that ground before.  Or wasn't it homophobe you called me before?  Or
racist?  This kind of address is an unimaginative form of name calling
that closes discussion and reduces provoking and beneficial discourse.
Call me what you want, these issues remain.  And they are very touchy.
But they won't go away because they are impossible to ignore with such
attempts at closure.

I'd prefer also if you would leave Tom out of this.  This discussion,
while perhaps in his spirit, has nothing whatsoever to do with him.
Hey, I'm a big boy misogynist now on my own.  If you want, I can
backchannel my credentials.  In addition, Tom has all but given up
poetry and I haven't spoken with him in months.

Re: Language Poetry.  That's a fairly restricted group of poets, to my
mind.  And I don't agree particularly with some of their methodology,
although, at various times, I have found their art to be quite
compelling.  I think those people were responding to specific political
and aesthetic pressures resticted to their own historical milieu.
What's followed, however, are watered down, thoughtless attempts to
imitate Language methods and forms by younger writers.  The results are
not very interesting from my point of view.  And that is all it is.  My
own small point of view.  But I'm glad my opinions are challenged
because it makes me think.

Otherwise, I find it perfectly admirable that you challenge me so openly
and publicly.  But it's beginning to be more like a personal vendetta on
your part rather than a discussion of issues:  race, gender, aesthetics.
Why don't you send your bull dog barks backchannel without boring other
folks.  Well, gossipy personal affairs are fun, but still.  Perhaps some
Grace?

Hey, let me tell you about:

_BoxKite: A journal of poetry & poetics_

This is a stunning new journal (it almost seems silly to call it that: at
320 pages, with a beautiful cover by Jess, wonderful layout & typography
throughout, including a section on an artist Idris Murphy's work, & all
that writing, it's a BOOK, & a beauty) with many contributions from
listmembers among others.

Oh by the way, it's from Australia, another big international poetry zine
to stand with John Kinsella's _SALT_, making me wonder just what's
happening down under these days.

Editor James Taylor has gathered poems, essays, & reviews by an astounding
group of writers & mixed them up for a great read. I cant take the hours to
name them all, but:

Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Armand Schwerner, Ronald Johnson, Robert Duncan
(from his notebooks), Robert Creeley, Norma Cole, Robert Kelly, Susan Howe,
Lyn Hejinian, Rae Armantrout, Michael Palmer, Charles Bernstein, Rosemarie
Waldrop, Hank Lazer, Susan Schultz, Pierre Joris, Chris Cheek, Charles
Alexander, etc.; Robert Adamson, John Kinsella, Kris Hemensley, Tracy Ryan,
& others from Oz; many translations, including new Brazilian poets; Tom
Raworth, Peter Middleton, Tom Leonard. So many more.

Ive been reading my way through with great delight for a few days now.
Strange to admit, here on e-mail, perhaps, but I remain a dedicated
bibliophile & _Boxkite_ is the answer to a bibliophile's dreams, it's just
such a *Book*.

You can order it ($20AU for a subscription + $5. postage) from The Poetics
Foundation, GPO Box 1500, Sydney, NSW 2001, Australia. Fax: (042) 94 3264.
Or e-mail editor James Taylor at <jtaylor@ideal.net.au> & ask for more
information.

And hey, The Poetics Foundation accepts VISA & Mastercard, which makes
ordering easy.

(Oh, well yes, I do have an essay therein too, but dont let that stop you,
this is a major addition to the journal scene & deserves our support.)

Gotts go read some more....

Dear Listmembers:

For an annotated bibliography I'll be compiling over the next few months I
would be interested in hearing (backchannel) from those of you who have
published essays, articles, chapters, interviews, substantial reviews, or
whole books on:

(a) Younger poets (loose rule of thumb: first books after 1985) working in
the "New American" (read: avant-garde, experimental, formally radical)
tradition

and/or

(b) language writing

Since some of the most important critical work in both these areas has
appeared in fugitive, ephemeral, little distributed, and unindexed venues,
I would especially appreciate tips as to work not likely to be retrieved by
conventional academic search engines.

The Annotated Bibliography for English Studies (ABES) is a bibliographic
resource edited in England, published in Holland, and available on-line and
by CD-Rom (for more info e-mail: abes@uea.ac.uk).  The post-1945 American
Poetry section, which will include the two sections mentioned above, is
being co-edited by Geoffrey Ward and Charles Bernstein.

Thanks,

this is all very stimulating, because, as dodie points out, while the
relationship between aesthetic judgment and the social conditions that give
rise to it has been discussed to death elsewhere, to the point where it
really can be a tiresome cliche, the general tenor of POETICS (not everyone
all the time, clearly) is notably either silent on or hostile to challenges
to "aesthetics" as the bottom line. i.e. my questions a few weeks ago: why
does the avant-g police its borders so vigilantly and why is aesthetic
consensus the bottom line?  lots of people responded to the first question
and virtually no one to the second. hence my comment also that the blurb
for m davidson's book (md argues that the aesthetics of modernism went hand
in hand w/ certain historical developments of the 20th c that determined
"how we read" or some such) is hardly a novel argument, but refreshing to
hear here.  i have nothing against people publishing their friends,
exercising strong editorial control, etc., and i have nothing against dale
smith or his poetry or his new magazine. it's the defensive appeal to an
aesthetic presumed to be objective and universal, and , worse, has moral
overtones (i.e. stein is a "deplorable" influence because her writing is
morally flawed) that the problem arises.  i'm also taken with kevin's point
that publishing what one likes is a worthy policy to challenge.  one thing
that struck me about the zines he writes about in his bio of spicer is how
*little* editorial control, or issues of "quality" determined what got
published and what didn't.  there was a sense of inclusiveness that seems
to me to be just fine, and actually pretty inspiring.  not that every mag
shd be broadly inclusive; but let's not write off the ones that are, or the
spirit they embody, as failing to police the borders of good writing.

why is it that when the issues are primarily male-identified issues like war,
rebellion against father, etc., the poetry is described as "poetry of real,
historical-personal experience, of people who have 'been there' in fact or
authentic imagination"... but when it is about FEMALE experience, i.e.
betrayal, abuse, being a nurse or civilian administrator in war, being
a non-combattant caught up in war,  it is " abstract, inhuman, solipsistic, hermetic," i.e. writing men "don't understand" and as such, devalued...

sigh.  i for one found the writing of Lady Borton on vietnam and vietnam war
some of the most gripping "vet" writing i've ever read.

Subject:      picking up sides (name-paradox thread)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Listopolitans, I welcome the many sensitive & various postings on this
topic, & even though I may be seen to have kicked it off inadvertently if
not drunkenly, I may be permitted a further & more sober posting on a
couple of its aspects.

Hoa Nguyen, I echo yr question & yr defiance re sides, & not wanting to be
on one. But one thing I hear in the echo, one thing I answer myself, is
that the sides are picked for us, & will never be entirely transcended, not
until (in only part as a result of our individual eforts) society undergoes
its slow mutations....It's like that Yeats' line, "They'll never love you
for yourself/ and not yr yellow hair". I when younger "didnt know there was
a side" that I was on...that was Fat City. Later, by the time it was
pointed out to me, my City was growing Leaner. Now I am A Straight White
Protestant Male, subject to quota-stringencies (in the matter of arts
grants, for e.g.), & probably further categorized as LangPo FellowTraveler.
It doesnt matter that I was bi for years in my youth, that the california
sun makes me look Bengali, or that I am atheist pantheist zen marxist
anarchist, or that most of my confidantes have been women & gay men,  or
that (in my opinion, granted) my poetry doesnt overlap much with anyone's.
And even though I am now enjoying minority status as an Old Fart, I know
the injustice you speak of, if only faintly compared to yours; it still
smarts. And it is unlikely in my case & and that of other SWM's, that we
will be invited to help diversify someone's group, leastwise here in
America. I get discriminated against for my yellow (well, i do dwell in the
past) hair, but not loved for it. But of course, there is a
cultural/language usage base that continues to give me advantages in a
society that is still tipped somewhat the same way. I reach for my Yeats
when needing a hit.

Excuse the lengthy background to my cry of sympathy! I want what I write to
be *poetry* to others, not an instance of cultural diversity/monotony. I
dont want to be the writer of it, do you know what i mean? Because *I* can
be pegged. I want *the reader* to recognize herself as the author of it.
Impossible, impossible. I hope it isnt published because of my lengthy
history of smallpress publishing, because someone likes me (god forbid!),
or because for 3 years I attended Haberdashers' Aske's Hampstead (huh?
where?)....Any more than a person of the theater wants to have gotten the
part because good at blowjobs. *On its merits*--thats what one wants. But
there'll never be a neutral jury. So dont Dale & co-editor have the right
to go on representing in their own ways a bent twisted society (v. maria
Damon's post) even while others who "know better" (despite being members of
the same bent, twisted society) have the right to attack, chide, or try
persuade them otherwise about their policies? "Younger Poets" is one zine
among hundreds (v. Spencer Selby's great list), & is not likely to get much
help grantwise in the present climate. Isnt it *human* (trans-cultural) to
be let go to hell by one's own route, even if it is equally *human* to try
to save people from so doing ? I realize this can sound like wishy-washy
liberalism, but I am arguing for other perceptions re this (lack of)
position. This thread is a worthwhile argument that cannot resolve, is one
thing I post to point out.

 And at base I am arguing for the purity of the work of art, a purity it
may well require a lifetime's education to recognize or realize, a radiance
that will forever suffer interference from the many-colored glass of the
multi-cultural classwar-ridden dome. I think I am arguing for what Barrett
Watten once summed up when he said : "I want my words to be my own." Bad
History is the anatagonist in this endeavor. I think we need to acknowledge
both, the ideal and its enemy. They do form a symmetry. I want my words to
be my own/I want my poem to be exempt from its association with me : these,
to my mind, are two facets of one figure. As my own, New, bringing news for
us; as my own, tainted with Bad History, that made me one of us.

Hoa, much in this post is only marginally relevant to yours, & for that I
apologize. But I thank you for the words that sparked my impulse to compose
this, even if I come shortly to regret having done so.  --Will i be wiser
later? Then why bother to live!   David

Elliza, are you speaking in general or reading things into what I said about
the meeting at which Honig spoke?  The steroetyping you describe goes on
a lot and the issue was brought up, indirectly at least, by a couple of
people (including me) at the meeting described - ie. Honig was reminded that
"life's battles" are ongoing & all over the place.  But neither Honig at the
meeting or me in my post called women's experience, wartime or otherwise,
abstract, inhuman, etc.  Although one person there, who had
discussed these matters with EH beforehand, said he (EH) had been trying
to understand Jorie Graham's work & having a hard time - he was thinking
of her work as representative of an "abstract" trend.

In any case, you can read misogyny into this if you want.  Honig's main
issue was that poetry loses something by not making the effort to
bring over lived experience - especially the apocalyptic historical
experiences of this century - in an attempt to represent SHARED experience.
HIS position.  "Bringing it over" is never simple though, considering
the blinders we put on or learn. - Henry Gould

ok, just recovering from a badass cold, and something tells me to leave
this one alone... seems there's just so much contentiousness in the air of
late... but ok, i'll bite:

first:  you can avoid publishing one aesthetic camp by choosing your
friends NOT on the basis of their aesthetic... and then publishing your
friends! (not your aesthetic)...

(((of course this is tough to do sometimes, if you *really* don't like a
friend's work)))

what your publishing commitment then might amount to, i'm not
sure---depends on your friends, which depends on you!... and hey---i use
the term "friends" here advisedly, and most selectively...

secondly:  on the one hand, and to be a bit extreme about it, one would be
wise not to assume that publishing an african-american poet will result in
poetry marked, say, by black dialect... which means, one would be wise not
to assume that a commitment to publishing one aesthetic will necessarily
result in a specific gender/race/class etc (though it very well may, and
often does)... if you oppose the simplicities of identity politics, then
you owe it to yourself to oppose aesthetic assumptions pertaining
thereto... and turning it the other way some, with a due eye for
appropriation, and just a tad figuratively---white guys can play the blues,
yes, conventional and otherwise...

on the other hand, one would be wise not to assume that the
gender/race/class of one's friends is an arbitrary reality... which is to
say, that if you find yourself hanging out mostly with white folks and are
white (like me, sadly), you can bet your sweet ass that this has
*something* to do with (our) social-institutional-political structures (and
of course, with your own convictions and abilities and motivations and and
and)... and if you're committed, as susan has suggested, to challenging as
a publisher/editor in any wayshapeorform something called the status quo,
why then you ought at least *as a publisher/editor* to consider what you
can contribute in the way of challenging these structures (which have
clearly been internalized by all of us, to varying degrees)... perhaps,
yes, you can challenge said structures through the writings of a specific
dominant group, but i would argue that history offers an alternative, more
complicated view of this matter (and i predicate here a belief in a
dominant group, or groups)...

and hey, actually, publishing, say, the work of people of color---people of
color who are and who are not mainstream writers---is far easier than
creating a network of friends and acquaintances that reaches across the
color line (assuming this latter is not already a part of your
experience)... it may even be a way for one to begin to establish working
relationships with people of color...

(((and "people of color" out t/here, please please forgive me this apparent
objectification, and this apparent urgency to "reach you" in this post)))

if on the other hand you are not opposed to the status quo in any
wayshapeorform when it comes to your publishing/editing self, and wish
simply to contribute an aesthetic product to a peopled world that some
people find relatively fucked, why then you run the risk of offering up
something that some people won't really give a hoot about, b/c your gesture
will likely be seen as somewhat beside the point (by some people)... even
if you oppose the status quo and yet presume to do so through the selective
work of selected dominant groups, the result is likely to be the same...

which, i suppose, is always a risk, in any case... which, i suppose, is ok
too, but doesn't exactly light *my* fire, motivationally *or* aesthetically
speaking...

best,

joe

Dale I didn't call you a misogynist.  My reply was to Maria's post about a
general cultural trend that's gone on since the beginning of time.  My
exact line was:  "Misogyny is indeed a vile weed that one has to
continually take a sickle to."  This line was intentionally overblown to be
humorous.  I then went on to say that I felt your reference to Stein was
NOT about misgyny but something broader.

Perhaps I'm missing something here, Dale, but I see no reason why I'd have
a personal vendetta against you.  So, let me make this clear, I, Dodie
Bellamy, do not have a personal vendetta against Dale Smith. You posted an
incendiary post and I was responding.  Remember, the women who do Chain are
*my* friends.  Though I'm sure they really don't need my defense, they're
doing such wonderful, important work.  Again, this emotional combustability
on your part, I feel, is very dangerous.   Emotional zeal often is kissing
cousins with dehumanization of the Other.  I did discuss issues in my last
post, but since I used a manner that's different than from yours I'm
accused of being gossipy with bulldogs--i.e., not to be taken seriously.
Let me quote Maria on this issue:

well . . . (and excuse me,,,, I've just gotten itno town and read all these
posts at one go) --

I suppoase it's one thing to create a mag. for the express purpose of
publishing poetry working in one set of aesthetic assumptions -- and I
suppose it's another thing to set up a mag. in which you publish mostly
"friends" --

but, in defense of those seemingly OK acts, to remark that few "minority"
poets write in innovative/experimental/blackmtn/nyschool whatever modes --
while at the same time giving every indication of never having really
bothered to find out if such is in fact the case --  that is far more than
simply being  provocative --

yes, please, grace to read as variously as possible

i like much of what bromige sez: sides have been picked for us and in some
ways we're capitulating to the powers that be by biting the bait that sez:
"lowbrow pc multicultural bootlicking fascists over here -- true poets and
lovers of the muse over there." or "there's only a *few* 'decent'
experimental poets of color out there..." it's like the arguments against
affirmative action that i hear from my older colleagues and some of the
younger ones, a specious representation v quality mindset.

All right.  Briefly, sans the modernist manifesto lingo.  And so I can
be taken out of context once again.  M&D is open to anyone regardless of
race, sex, gender or religion.  It's open to anything that strikes our
fancy.  I try to keep the thing as inclusive as possible.  I do prefer
certain poems over others.  I respect those who publish what they don't
like.  But if I don't have an emotional attachment to what I publish,
it's not going to appear in my magazine.  For me, emotion is not
"dangerous," as Dodie suggests, nor does it promote the "dehumanization
of the Other." Rather, emotion promotes a sympathetic response to
others.  Without that dramatic connection, language loses some of its
power to communicate.  A poetics that appeals to the mind only falls
apart under the weight of its own logic, its own pitifully misguided
propositions.  The mind, after all, likes control.  It digs that kind of
power.  Emotions fight against that urge for control in the very tissues
of our being.  Language, when it's executed well, is formed from an
emotional impulse that is, hopefully, guided by the mind toward a clear
directon of some kind.  My missives of late have been a bit heavy, which
is in part, I think, a reaction to the mostly bland language posted in
this electronic format.  Forgive my indelicacies.  And buy M&D's.

Re: Stein.  That's what really seems to be upsetting to certain people
on the list.  Well, I dismiss her work, not because she is a woman, but
because I find it unbearable to read.  So many posts have been
profoundly condescending and I appreciate your efforts to set me
straight, so to say.  But Stein, who is adored by many, including Phil
Whalen and Alice Notely, both of whom I deeply admire, provides a kind
of model for a poetics that I find misleading, presumptive, and
ultimately useless because she takes you nowhere.  You gain nothing by
reading her.

I picked on Chain, although it is a journal composed mainly of women,
because I find the work distant, cold, and removed from emotional
possibilities.  I have no sympathy for its poetics nor do I read any
sympathetic writing between its covers.  It is over long, incredibly
laden with awkward verse void of music and heavy on a tired methodology
that, rather than confronting the idea of the Father, as those editors
have suggested, merely ignore that figure, and pretend it does not
exist.  It's great to take a stand on something.  But you need feet to
stand on and Chain's poetics have not even a leg.

But again, as I've stressed.  These are my opinions and I assumed they
would be ignored.  Luckily, there are many who feel the necessity of
confronting the ills of the world.  And, I suppose, not feeling any
sympathy for Stein and expressing such, is dangerous business these
days. Or maybe, probably, I am being overly dramatic, and all of this
will convert back into the dark zone of forgetfulness within a day or
so.

It's interesting that several white male contributors to this thread have
admitted having trepidations about getting involved. I think that's a shame
and admit to having trepidations of my own. Feels a little like peering
over the rim of the foxhole.

Despite the best will in the world accidents have a lot to do with what one
chooses to publish, and I don't mean the large accidents of birth, class
and education. Unfamiliar poetry, it should surprise no one, often takes an
effort to get into, and one is flooded with new poets all the time. Somehow
a particular body of work gets one's attention.

Case in point: the first book that Junction Press published is Susie Mee's
_The Undertaker's Daughter_. Susie and I had been friends for a few years
and had got into the habit of working over each other's stuff. So I got to
know these poems that I might in other circumstances have passed over with
hardly a glance, because they are more conservative technically than what I
usually find useful--I had, for reasons having nothing to do with the press
(it didn't exist yet), spent a lot of time with them. And they're very good
and more than weird enough to meet my needs (in case anyone's curious,
Susie's father was the undertaker in Howard Finster's home town--Howard's
portrait of her father adorns the cover).

Mervyn Taylor is another example. I was going out with a woman who worked
part-time at a school where Mervyn taught. She sponsored a reading by the
students and faculty, and I went along for the ride. The stuff bowled me
over, and I'm now waiting for yet another book manuscript from him. I
wasn't looking for a black poet--I wasn't looking for anything beyond being
courteous to the woman that I saw very briefly--and Mervyn was not one of
my friends or in my circle, although he is now both.

These books came to me by means of what I'll call accidents of attention.
They were chosen, like the others, because I found them useful. "Useful" is
usually what a writer means when he or she says that he or she likes
another writer's work--useful for one's work or one's spiritual development
(for writers usually the same thing) or for the expansion of one's taste at
that juncture.

It happens through no conscious fault of my own that the press (like the
magazine I did in the 70's and the several series' that I've run) thus far
is diverse enough to be considered politically correct--not including my
own book, three are by women (of two different religions), one of whom is
hispanic, altho not US hispanic, one is by a black man, the others by white
males. But this is purely fortuitous. The other books came to me because I
asked for them from friends or because they were recommended to me by
friends--they had commanded more than ordinary  attention for reasons other
than the poems themselves. The diversity is, I think, a matter of the size
and diversity of the market (the agora) I hung out in. Had I been in Boise
instead of New York matters might have been different.

It's not that I make no efforts. I have approached poets, as I did Mervyn,
who were not part of my extended circle. Thus far most of the poets I've
found useful, in whatever circles they travel, already have publishers and
are not available to Junction. That's another kind of accident. And I've
asked for manuscripts from poets who impressed me at readings but whose
work didn't make it for me independent of their presence.

Junction's next four books are by men. One is hispanic, and Mervyn's second
means one is by a black man, although that still leaves me with just the
one person of color. That will bring me to 11 books--at what point will I
be exposed to charges that I discriminate against Asians? I'm certainly
aware that that's a possibility, but the standard won't change. Throw as
wide a net as I might it won't bring in every fish, and of those I catch
I'll still only choose the ones I find most useful (I'm aware of how smelly
that last metaphor is).

It's entirely possible that Junction's next four books will be by Asian
women, but I'll be able to live with it if they're not.

In my magazine I once published a poem that I'd liked when I heard it read
by the poet. In the wee hours when I was typesetting it I was overcome with
nausea--given more scrutiny the depth of the poem's dishonesty came home to
me. But I was stuck--the piece was accepted. It happens that it was by
someone I knew well. I take my publishing very seriously--each book is my
product as well as the poets--so I've tried real hard to make sure that
that never happens again, although the poem in question got a lot of praise
from the magazine's readers.

now this is really disingenuous --

Who was it in this exchange who posited it as a question of publishing
"minority" or women poets VS publishing poetry "I" like??

Why would anyone think that they would have to publish poetry they didn't
like in order to publish poets who are not white men?

I'll forget my own name next, but the magazine featured one or two poets

        This is Dan Zimmerman, one of those guys Stephen Ellis published in
_:that:_, the magazine he and Stephen Dignazio edited out of Peacham,
VT. Steve moved first to Ra'anana, Israel, and now lives in Amman,
Jordan, where he now publishes Oasii broadsides. This year he also
published _Blue Horitals_, a collaboration I did with my late friend and
mentor, John Clarke [former editor of _intent._].
        Just looking at the copies of _:that:_ I have at hand, I find among the
first ten issues [two writers in each] Margueritte, Karen Driscoll,
Susan Smith Nash and Cathleen Shattuck.
        [By the way, a review of Gerrit Lansing's _Heavenly Tree Soluble
Forest_ which appears at

        http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/ezines/spt/signals2.html

refers to Gerrit (and John Clarke, and me) as "[belonging] to that
much-maligned group 'the Olson cult,' 'the last all-male group in the
U.S. gathered around a particular poet' (Marjorie Perloff)." The list of
19 "members" which follows includes Joanne Kyger and Alice Notley!]
        Maybe I'm just an old fart, but I see no reason whatsoever why Dale
Smith or Steve Ellis or any _independent_ editor should feel obliged to
publish anything he or she doesn't want to, or even to seek work from
any particular kind of group he or she doesn't want to. I stress
_independent_ because, as editor of _College English Notes_, the
newsletter of the New Jersey College English Association [and answerable
to an editorial board], I feel obliged to include work by the non-white,
non-straight, and non-male _IF_ I like it well enough, but also to seek
such work through calls for contributions from the members of NJCEA.
When I have _independently_ edited magazines in the past, I asked for
work from writers I admired, period [that was a long time ago; few or no
n-ws, n-ss, n-ms came to mind--not that I excluded anyone on
principle!]. If I edit any magazines _independently_ in the future, I
expect to post public calls for work, but may not, depending on what I
want to do artistically, issue by issue. And why not?

No bone to pick here other than to say that the word useful in the context of
this post makes me feel uneasy. Useful is a pregnant term when used in this
context. Too entrenched as a term of authority or the establishment. In the
present popularity contest atmosphere of publishing, useful extends to the
person, the author who becomes useful to the publisher or to the critic for
perhaps reason of race, gender, etc. Useful seems to me to better suggest a
pass/fail for authorship; the minimum requirement having been met (chosen for
us perhaps), the author is the one which becomes useful, the poem a mere
incidental of the exchange. The next thing you know, we are speaking of a poet
as being "owned" as the dead poets are.

Of course _I_ knew what I meant, and I didn't think it could be
misconstrued so thoroughly. Here's at it again, more completely: the work
that takes me from where I am as writer and person to someplace I hadn't
suspected was there. Not likely to have been "established," or it wouldn't
have been a surprise. Gerritt Lansing's work, for example. Now I'm not
always ready for the new thing when it appears in my life. Hell, there was
a time when all hummingbirds looked the same to me, because my eye had not
learned its lessons yet. So one poem of Gerritt's might have gone right
past me without my noticing while I might have been there to meet another.
I may be there for the first poem some other time, at some other juncture.
If I am, it will be a coming together out of which something else may come,
hardly appropriation as chattel.
Not much of a chip in the fame game, either.
I chose to call my press Junction for a reason.

I'll speak only to the least interesting point in this very interesting
post. I knew Edwin Honig briefly but intensely for a month at the MacDowell
Colony 19 years ago. He was, then as now, a poet with a small but
respectable reputation, and he was then, as apparently now, very bitter
about what he saw as his outsider status and rather defensively arrogant
about the uniqueness of his talent and integrity. I liked him a lot, but
I'm not sure he reciprocated: I think I may have been in his mind one of
the barbarians at the gate. His work, as it happens, is interesting, and a
strong sense of integrity is one of its virtues. It doesn't look to have
been easy to produce. In some ways he reminds me of Bill Bronk. I cut him a
lot of slack.

I've been meaning to ask this for a while.  This bickering over how many
women and people of color an editor knows--we could add many more
categories of 'otherness'--reminds me.  What means are producers of
poetry and poetic institutions using to develop and expand audiences?
If reading makes writing, what are folks doing to expand the audience
base.  I am interested to know in what strategies producers are using.
It seems to me a critical part of the politics.

Dale asks:

>1) how do
>you publish poetry you love and 2) still represent poets of diverse
>backgrounds?

Mostly I stay out of these discussions because I inevitably get
flamed up by folks who insist on seeing me as some sort of Political
Correctness Fascist and/or a demon of aesthetic relativism.  But this
discussion is so interesting I can't help jumping in.

My notion of staying diverse might be different from most.  Under the
imprint of Burning Cities and Viet Nam Generation, Inc., I publish a series
called "White Noise" which features white male poets of mostly working
class origins and/or identification, who have a progressive political
orientation
(including our own Joe Amato--hi Joe!). In this particular case, I'm
publishing WhiteHetMales on purpose, with full knowledge of exactly what
I'm doing.  I'm doing it because I think these particular guys have
something really interesting to say, and I think they say it well.  Most of
the poetry books I publish are in this White Noise series (7 so far, with
numbers 8-10 in the works), but I have also published books by women,
Chicano, and African American poets, and in my journal, _Viet Nam
Generation_, the mix is so various I can't break it down.  Most of the
poets I publish are politically progressive.

I do read and enjoy some right wing poets, but I don't often publish them.
Mostly I just don't feel like it.  And the beauty of running my own press
is that I don't have to publish what I don't feel like publishing.  On the
other hand, I don't publish any poetry I don't think is good.  And "good"
means whatever I like, for whatever reasons I like it. (Reasons, by the
way, I'm happy to clearly define for anyone who asks about why I like a
particular poem.) Anybody who tries to argue that "good" means something
else, I believe, is just layering rationalization on faith.

>Also, my friends who write the poetry I like, happen to be predominately
>white and male.  I prefer friends' work to strangers.  But I don't limit
>it in that way.

Well, this does seem to be the crux of the issue.  I think, on one level or
another, most of us publish our friends, submit our poems to our friends,
read at our friends' bookstores or colleges, and so on.  I mean, this is a
small world, divided into smaller cliques, and it's hard to escape.  Me,
I'd go nuts if most of my friends were white and male.  I need a good mix
or I'm miserable.
So I work hard at putting myself in situations where I'm going to meet people
who are not white and/or not male in order to feed my burning need for
variety.  And what I've found is that when I connect to new people--make new
friends--the doors of new communities open up to me.  My African American
friends who are poets send me poetry by *their* friends, who are often
African American.  But--at least in my experience--all this diversity has
to be based on *real* relationships, real friendships and collegial
connections between people who genuinely like and respect and try to
understand each other.  My immediate assumption, as a white person, is that
when I make a new contact with a person of color, the burden of proof is on
*me* to demonstrate, over a period of time, that I do have a genuine liking
and respect for the person and his/her work, and that I'm *not* simply
"collecting" token poets or token friends to feed my own image.  After a
while my intentions become clear and that's a basis for building mutual
trust and respect (a process which is neverending).  Takes a lot of time
and energy.  But then, don't all friendships?

As a politically radical feminist and an African Americanist, I find it
sometimes harder to maintain my friendships with WhiteHetMales than with
members of some other groups.  But, because there are many things I greatly
admire about my WhiteHetMale friends as poets and as human beings, I put in
the effort.  Of course, this isn't a one-sided project (what friendship
is?), and I give my WhiteHetMale friends full credit for doing an awful lot
of work to maintain their friendships with me.  It's a hell of stretch for
all parties concerned. My guess is that we do it because we're suckers for
complexity, for stimulus,
for contact.

In regards to Henry Gould's comment about Edwin Honig pushing for readings or a
series of readings by Vietnam vet poets, well, I've been doing those for
years.  The Sixties Conference hosts a coffeehouse where we feature Viet
Nam veteran poets, and we've also had poets reading the work of Vietnamese
writers in translation.  Readers have included W.D. Ehrhart, Dale
Ritterbusch, David
Connolly, Alan Farrell, David Vancil, David Willson, R.S. Carlson, Kevin
Bowen and Coleman.  Martha Collins and Wayne Karlin have read works in
translation from their anthologies.  Like Honig, I do find this poetry
"interesting and real," although I don't have Honig's objections to other
sorts of more cerebral poetry, or simply poetry by folks who haven't "been
there done that."  At the same time, I'm pretty picky about the Viet vet
poets I publish.  I think that I've come across 50-60 good ones, which is a
lot.  But, on the other hand, I've read work submitted by maybe 500-600
Viet vet poet wannabes, which has convinced me that "being there" isn't any
guarantee you can speak articulately or effectively about being there.  As
a (perhaps) interesting aside, I find the work of the *less*
self-consciously "literary" Viet Vet poets more compelling than the work of
the "famous" Viet vet poets like Weigl and Komunyakaa for reasons which
have everything to do with my preference for what I think of as "plain" vs.
"fancy" narrative style in the work of poets and writers portraying the
effects of traumatic experiences.  (I'm consistant this way, since I also
prefer the hyperpop narrative style of Gus Hasford to the novelistic
devices
of Tim O'Brien.) It's a personal bias, and I acknowledge it straight out.

Now, I'm used to (and even more importantly, the poets I publish are used
to) having such poetry dismissed by folks who wave the banner of
"aesthetics"
as a measure of quality.  I even publish some cowboy poets who are
also--not coincidentally--Viet Nam veterans, and I'm always amazed at the
stony refusal to acknowledge this still vital genre by the folks who
inhabit university creative writing programs.

What it all comes down to for me (and I was talking to Dan Featherstone
about this--hi Dan!--last night), is that I don't give a damn about what
any sort of self-appointed or actual "poetry establishment" thinks about
either my press or the poets I publish. I publish what I like, because I
like it and because I think it's good, in the sense that I defined "good"
above.  And people are gonna call me whatever they want, and they'll refer
to my press however they want, or some of them will ignore me and hope I
disappear.  But the bottom line is that I've got books of poetry in print,
and I'm proud of them, and their authors are proud of them, and people
actually buy them and read them and get something out of them.  Since no
small press I know of makes enough money for either its authors or its
owners (or officers, if it's a nonprofit) to be stimulated by the prospect
of monetary gain, I figure that this is as good an attitude as any. So it
doesn't bother me a bit if Dale publishes mostly white guys, and if Chain
publishes mostly women.  Even though poets do the writing, presses are
always already expressions of their editors and owners. I expect no less.

I *would* like to see more presses in the hands of women and people of
color, but, then I'd like to see power distributed more evenly in just
about every realm of culture and society, which accounts--no doubt--for my
politics.

What it comes down to for me (and a part of me wants to laugh uproariously
and derisively as I say this) is love.  For most of us this is an unpaid
gig, and why would we do it if we didn't love it?  I can't publish what I
don't love.  Now, sure, I'm willing to try to learn to love new things, but
I don't think we've got a whole hell of a lot of control over the deepest
levels of our attractions.  We might be able to *explain* those attractions
and we might even judge 'em as "constructive" or "destructive" or whatever,
but it sure is hard as hell to change 'em.  What I've found though, is that
sometimes I meet new kinds of writing that feel like coming home, that give
me the sensation of, "Oh, yeah, I've always loved this; I just hadn't run
across it yet."  So I seek diversity not out of a sense of duty, but out of
a desire to find new things to love.  "Love" is one of those words you're
supposed to be embarrased to say in academic circles, but if I can't talk
about poetry in terms of love (though, of course, not *only* in terms of
love), I figure why talk about it at all?

Why does this have to be a dilemma?

But when it comes down to it, I don't have a problem with friend
journals (I think this is a good way to interact with the world; I like
to see how people that are friends and poets are talking to each other).
When you put the call on poetics list I had the oh this looks
interesting I think I'll send a check reaction.

I don't think you are accusing me of this but just want to make this
clear. I'm trying to take up your invitation to talk about editing
issues because these kinds of things dominate my life. I'm not
complaining about what you are doing.

And like you I want to make decisions without race/gender concerns and I
think I do in Chain. We (I co-edit it with Jena Osman) have never
published anyone because they fit some category (and you are wrong to
think the cultural marketplace, whatever form this might take, cares; it
might be a more interesting world if they did; but as far as I can tell
the cultural marketplace cares only about "aesthetics"--look at who or
what gets NEAs).

But unlike you, I have a problem with the word aesthetics b/c it means
to me things that are too neat. (Granted, when I think of this word I
think of journals that use this criteria to smooth over and glaze
things. I don't think I'm thinking of what you mean judging by the list
of people you had in the journal. Maybe you could clarify your
aesthetics and maybe I could learn to love the word.)

But we did start Chain in order to explore aesthetics or how to avoid
aesthetics. We felt there were a lot of journals that had things too
neat and we wanted things messy. (too messy?) So we made a point, and
still do, to get rid of the "is this an aesthetically pleasing poem"
question and to ask the "does this poem tell us something we might not
already know or show us something a little sideways" or some question
like that. What it makes is a messy journal. One with friends and
enemies and with work that we may or may not like. (Although I tend to
like it but I tend to like things.) I think wanting people to think I'm
a nice guy has little to do with it. If it did I would probably publish
more friends and stop returning their work when it doesn't fit the
topic.

I want all sorts of journals. I want them all funded and available. I
want Chain and I want Yale Younger Poets to have this very badly. It
seems especially important to have both if we tend to publish work by
women (and men also?) you don't like. Maybe when something comes into
YYP that you don't like you could send it over to us.

Who are you talking about when talk about corporate/academic funding?
The only thing I can think of are those journals that graduate programs
start to promote the graduate program. I call these the state
journals--the Ohio Quarterly, the Hawaii Review, the Iowa Review, etc.
(Chain was an attempt to take advantage of this tradition of funding
journals for graduate students; it worked for a while).

My poetics has been influenced by NY School, Black Mountain, _and_ Stein
(Pound a little less). That is only the beginning. Does that matter?

I probably wouldn't say that about Chain's aesthetics. I couldn't figure
that out.

There are many writers of color writing experimental poetry. There are
many editors also. It doesn't take a search to realize this. Although
unfortunately, it does take a library or some other depository with a
decent poetry collection.

With respect,

Juliana

i take it these remarks are directed at me.  it was not my intention to be
condescending.  but i must say, the sentence "you gain nothing by reading
her" could easily be rendered more honestly as "*I* gain nothing by reading
her."  that would vitiate the moral bombast i find irksome.  esp when
coupled with the implication that it's a real struggle to find women/poets
of color who are any good. your take on stein isn't the "really" upsetting
thing for me; it's simply the easiest for me to respond to.  i am not
unsympathetic to the difficulty of finding material outside of one's
networks; the xcp conference will be a  reflection of that, and i hope i
learn to expand my network as a result.  but the tone in which this
difficulty is expressed (as if it were an objective truth that "there are
so few good ones out there" rather than "I'm not connected with those
circles") is what i find problematic.  as for condescension, could it be
that i'm just not being as warm and fuzzy as usual since you've just
insulted my (apparent) gender, my politics, my aesthetics, and my self?

Both your posts, William Burmeister and Mark Weiss, were of interest, I
found, & I doubt that you are far apart in your thinking on the
matter...its just that "useful" has a big range. What William has to say re
the objectification of the poet, the commodification of the poet I should
say, so thoroughly until the poetry becomes as vestigial as an appendix, is
sadly accurate to the times. I liked too the analogy Mark used, about all
hummingbirds at one time looking the same to him, before his eye was
trained. Thanks to both, & all who have graced this thread. Makes me
realize anew how grateful I am for this List.

++++++++++

And also because one can get such various info so fast : thanks to those
who posted the e-ddresses I was looking for ; I now have them both.

jordan suggests several mags that he believes might serve as
models...  so then, i'd ask dale if he agrees? (cause ov course
if he does, then why start another mag that duplicates existing?)
id guess, based on his comments, he would disagree, and precisely
on th point that jordan brings up--tho some branches in LangPo share
lineage w/ th NY/Pound tradition, dale seems to be climbing a different
trunk of the family tree.  What exactly are the distinguishments you
want to make, dale--the aesthetics that you refer to as the basis for
your editorial judgement?  i'm not clear, only that they are Not the
aesthetics of Chain, or Stein--what Are they?  and the followup question
to the list wd be, could you suggest names & addresses of writers w/in
that aesthetic who might widen/diversify dale's circle of friends...

*love* that post, kali!...

i would add only that the love of justice has something to do with all of
this (certainly nothing one-to-one about it, no hard & fast lines to be
drawn when it comes to love)... it seems odd, i know, even moralistic or
dogmatic to say so... but i would say that there is a measure of
responsibility entailed in going public, & that it's up to each of us to
reflect on same...

well anyway, i too have learned a lot thus far from this thread, & have to
observe that it seems to have invigorated this list... so thanx to *all*
for participating in this exchange...

best,

Dear SHARPists,

I am interested in finding any available information, private or public, opinion
or fact, on the state of the Small Press Movement and private publishers in
general around the globe. I do not wish to include the vanity presses in my
query.

Is the Small Press Movement still a force to be reckoned with when it comes to
discovering new talents, especially in the field of poetry?

Has the Small Press Movement expanded with the introduction of the PC and DTP,
and is DTP taking over from hand printing.

How does the Small Press Movement cope with advertising their wares and with
distribution without incurring greater overheads?

Are there any magazines, electronic / Internet or hard copy, devoted exclusively
to Small Press publishers?

I would be particularly interested in hearing from any SHARP members with
personal knowledge, or their own presses, or who can pass on to me contact names
and addresses / e-mail that I may follow up.

I'd like to respond briefly to several posts.  Right on Kali & Juliana,
yes - though I probably sound often like Mr. Smooth-it-over aesthetics
on this list, I AGREE with your healthy editorial perspective(s), & in
lil nedge way have often taken poems that are naive & rough from the persp.
the academic style-is-power school (in its many variants) -

Elliza, everything you say about the chauvinist attitude re: "real experience"
is true & historically documentable but I don't understand why you insist
on putting words in Honig's mouth - he never said "there is no poetry of
authentic experience" - he just said there is a strong stream right now -
maybe an ascendant stream (vid. Jorie Graham, Lang Po, other currents)
supported by much critical hoogabooga, which is so intent on analyzing
the non-consistency or problematic nature of self & experience, that
history as a shared reality or world phenomenon - the self as participant
in a cataclysmic century or in mass movements of peoples & nations -
has been downplayed - & that the poetry of vets now is a link with
certain streams of political poetry in the 30s with which he identifies
in a strong emotional way (he said vets - not MEN or WOMEN vets).  So
is it possible to discuss this issue without necessarily framing it in the
context of patriarchy & chauvinist interpretations of reality?
Maybe not.  I'm just asking.

Mark, Honig's collected poems are forthcoming online at Wendy Battin's
CAPA, hopefully in the next couple months.  Yes he is an irascible sly
literary fox with a hell of a sharp tongue & one-upmanship instincts
bred on Brooklyn streets in 20s & 30s - proud, proud - maybe blinkered
in his "aesthetics" - but he just wants people to read some of his
heavy great poems... I see him as a specifically human force vs.
present academic/aesthetic/commercial bureaucracies (not that I'm
against the academy, or art, or commerce!  Heck no!  Just ask Jack
Spandrift!) - Henry Gould

Subject:      A Note on Prejudice
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I have no direct response to the issues raised by Dale Smith's candid
embodiment of his prejudices, and the List's various and, for the most
part, generous response to it, but a few days before the controversy broke
surface here (hot on the heals of Slider affair) I wrote a small note to no
one in particular on some similar themes.  It's somewhat long for e-mail,
but I'll risk it here on a quiet Saturday afternoon....

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Notes to Poetry 5

How are prejudices--one might equally say tastes--built up in us during the
endless apprenticeship to textuality?  How does it happen that not only
certain texts or authors but indeed whole stances, entire ways of proposing
the scale and texture and objective of a writing practice, come to be
placed under a subjective taboo: boring, aggravating, sickening; worst of
all, neutral or blank.  There is no element of a poem to which value,
however carefully checked by description, does not cling.  The way this
poem looks on the page (another prose block, or some
mechanically-reproduced stanza form: forty pages of tercets!), the way this
one attacks the question of sound (clumsy, or heavy-handed, or lacking,
or...: the objections are endless on this front), the way this one asks me
to suppose the world is something dramatically other, and usually
drastically worse, than what I think it is (a world of only suburban
backyards or rural solitudes or ineradicable bitterness and domination).
Inexhaustible ways, then, to be opinionated about the poem without yet
having reached, let alone read, it.  And this makes for a dilemma not only
for the addicts of openness (pluralists), not only for the tough customers
of program and principal (dogmatists), but for anyone who reads not as a
duty or a chore (the academics) but as a risk.

Catherine Walsh's *Pitch* maintains a porous border relative to its
materials and manifests a lively sense of variability in both its open
field and stanzaic modes of composition.  In the absence of one manifestly
"dominant" formal element, it seems plausible to relate the field of the
page to the field of consciousness, the play of print to that of percepts.
It sounds terrific, and yet it is just the sort of book that of late I've
found it inordinately difficult to value.  My restlessness takes the form
of a craving for the determinate; less the "concrete" (it's not a deficit
of the referent, such as a jolt of "imagism" or "objectivism" might remedy,
that my attention suffers under) than the...the only word that comes to
mind is the _tensed_.  Indeed, with a little reflection I see that the
poetics of diffusion has always presented an obstacle to me and that a
whole constellation of preferences has arranged itself around this kernel
of prejudice: O'Hara over Ashbery, Armantrout over Berssenbrugge, Williams
over Stevens, Lorenz Hart over Sonic Youth, and so forth.  What thou loveth
well is one thing--source of orientation, courage, and comfort.  But it is
from the unlit regions, where the sun of prejudice hasn't already
illuminated every detail, that mind-changing texts are most likely to come.


Over time, and with the benefit of hearing Walsh read aloud from both her
own and from Samuel Beckett's texts, the specificity of the work has come
clearer to me, somewhat to my embarassment but much more to my relief
(surely the affective component, as much as the cognitive one, plays a role
in "changing one's mind": what haven't we at one time or another said in
order to mask or avoid the vulnerability of not thinking "x" anymore but
lacking the emotional wherewithal demanded in a given context to say so?).
In her reading, I heard what I've never heard before at a reading: a person
who could successfully bring into a public space that incredibly important,
but absolutely fragile--seemingly untransportable--tonal landscape of
intimate speech: the whisper, the interrogative tone used only with people
utterly familiar and deeply loved, the falling tone in the broken-off
utterance, the slight startle back into speech after a silent spell in
another's presence, the undertones of talking to oneself, the quizzical
texture of the many messages we address to inanimate things and non-verbal
beings, ....  What I learned at the reading was that I had failed to
understand precisely the pitch of Walsh's *Pitch*.  It may be that as an
American I at first heard only the sense of pitch as come-on, the ad-pitch
(the carnivalesque cover of the book perhaps prompting me also in that
direction).  But nothing could be further from the canned speech of
chattering capitalism than her work.  When Walsh read from Beckett's *Texts
for Nothing* I suddenly heard the adjectival form, as in "pitch" black, and
worked my way back to the tar-dark substance whose place in Beckett's
topography is all the more secure for rhyming with the locus of so much of
the (in)action in his work--the "ditch."  And when I heard her own work,
the musical and linguistic senses of the word came to the fore.  In
utterances, tone or pitch does two things especially well: it marks out new
information (sorting rhemes from themes) and it articulates, through any
number of lexical (exclamations) and non-lexical (interjections) means, the
speaker's relationship to the message.  Irony is largely a matter of tone,
as its opposite, earnestness.  In specifically poetic terms, intonation has
frequently been advanced as free verse's answer to meter: the mechanism
that moved Pound, to take only the famous instance, off the metronome and
onto the musical phrase.  While Walsh's texts present quite various forms
to the eye--conventional stanza, calligram, prose-block, Eigner-like lyric,
field composition--what they tend to present to the ear is a certain tone,
or pitch, that enters into a dialectic with its transcription.

a lot to whom who could say was it
owing speak English keep a record and
interrupt for God's sake interrupt
did I write that before as or after
(from "Pitch: Part Two" 27)

Hannah Weiner, news of whose sad loss came not long after I heard Walsh
read, would have sought graphic means to differentiate the "voices" here,
but Walsh provides her reader with only minimal cueing.  In the tightly
cycling stanzas of an untitled lyric (*Pitch* 21) possessing the echoing
strains of Zukofsky's signature valentines--Walsh uses the vocative
interjection most associated with the poetic tradition:"o glad snow /
morning of light / less wish / you were here // here to sing / holiday o /
glad snow / light less / morning wish / you were here...."  One hears in
these lines the "circadian / rhythm" (22) that Walsh's writing moves in,
mimics, and--quietly--masters.

[18-19 September 1997]

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
*Pitch* was published by Pig Press in Durham in 1994.  Catherine Walsh read
from this and other works on 3 September 1997 as part of a celebration of
Irish poetry at Brown University that also included Billy Mills, Randolph
Healy, and Maurice Scully.

I read this list blind (in digest form but I'm also in a time zone that gets the

out of step.

Yesterday's discussion was strange. And I feel yucky.

But can I just make one thing clear--excepting the first issue, Chain publishes
about
50/50 in terms of the pink and the blue of it. I can't decide if it is good that
 people
think it publishes more women or if it is just another example of how weird sexu
al

Dale's aesthetic complaints I understand. I hear them all the time here in natur
e poetry
central. I'm cool by them (even if they feel a little hostile; have I grown too
sensitive here in the land of aloha?). Everything isn't for everyone and it is a
 better
world for it.

But I don't understand the confrontation of the law of the father. Whose father?
And how don't we here at the chain/Stein power nexus like him? Is there some
specific moment that you are talking about Dale? I hope I've stayed away from
this rhetoric. I really like mine who just turned 82 and is still playing
golf daily.

Dale is right--Chain is too long.

I wish Chain was dangerous. I worry more about irrelevant.

Legless,

very interesting stuff steve.  i find that my aesthetic sense has changed
since joining POETIX. i have mixed feelings about that; i feel that i've
gained some "sophistication" maybe but may have lost some ability to hear
the emotional subtexts that make "cliches" interesting, endearing,
powerful, meaningful-in-context, etc.  some ability to listen
empathetically has perhaps ceded to my search for aesthetic thrills...md

I apologize if I made it sound like I "knew" Chain published more
women.  My point was only that it didn't bother me if different
journals presented different groups of poets (though I might choose
to read one journal over another based on their publishing decisions)
since that seemed to me one of the preconditions of publishing--that
we have biases and agendas.  Didn't have Chain on hand, wasn't
counting, was wrong to accept the description as fact.

But, yeah, sexual politics are really weird.  Whenever I'm in a
group in which half of the people talking are female, the general
sense of many of the male participants and at least some of the
female participants seems to be that women *dominate* the group.
Maybe that's what's happening with the reception of Chain.

Thank you David Bromige for your thoughtful and vulnerable response.

In this discussion-- as everywhere-- we find ourselves named various
names-- a physiologist-like look at this would point to the way our
brains try to categorize objects and beings in an effort to make
meaning.  This is helpful when it comes to, say, mushrooms-- this one is
yummy sauted with garlic, this one will attack my liver if I eat it,
this one will make me laugh profoundly at the word "liver", and etc.
This is very tricky of course in social applications and all sorts of
horrible or frustrating things can happen.  It happens when we talk
about poetry too.  I have work published in several issues of both *Mike
and Dale's Younger Poets* and *Chain*.   My work in *Chain* is "distant
cold and removed from emotional possiblilities" (Dale) and I am part of
the gang of SWM in M/D's in spite of myself?

Categories serve to narrow and simplify when -- outside of mushroom-like
instances -- things stubbornly refuse categorizing.  (Which was
definately bothering me the whole while I wrote towards the "What is
white" thread, with Mr. Timmons and others awhile back-- that I was
insisting on delimiting a category because, I think, I experience the
catorizations in a very real way). So what do we do?

I am glad indeed that we can dialoge around this and that folks have
been so willing to share their thoughts and feelings.

I am working on a novel about writing and the poetics of writing, about
email, about lag, and the collapse of the poetic. It may never see the
light of day, back of night, but it is relevant in the scattered form I
catastrophize in, below. For your pleasure or scattered delete ...
_______________________________________________________________________




Notes for a Novel:


Which I do work on: "Her nights, his days. Her days, his nights."

And that he comes to a foreign city and does not understand the language.
And that the airport is brown. He's got a sheet of paper, he can't de-
cipher. What is it, where is she. He shows it, there's a taxi, a sheroot,
he gets in, it's already old, nervous. He goes somewhere, recognizes
nothing. Characters in other scripts, cuneiforms for all he knows. Llamas
cross his path.

But the city's vacant, her place is vacant. Locked or unlocked - in this
novel, it won't make a difference. He goes in, the door opens. There's
nothing, no clues. It's clean, no dust, breakins. He doesn't know. This is
a man, Travis maybe, who doesn't know a thing.

He can't find her friends because everyone shrugs. He meets people who
speak his language, easy now. They know her. They haven't 'seen her
around.' She's the kind of person one sees around. She's private. But
there are no rumors, nothing. She works in medicine.

Well, she hasn't been at the clinic. Nothing is missing. You can see where
this is going, of course. Doors close behind him, before he reaches the
knob. The keys are like Berlin keys, they go through the hole, out the
other side. That's important, there are windows through rooms and no one
is ever looking.

Now something has to happen for the novel to be a novel, what then? Per-
haps a clue, but there are always clues, even clues in the beginning of
things, the glance of a dark-haired woman at the airport, a slip of cel-
lophane on the floor of her flat. Clues are things that gather meaning,
reverse time, reconstitute events. But things are cluttered here; the
sook is filled with blood where the animals are slaughtered, nomads come
in from the countryside, shrines are staffed by garage gong bands. The
Genkai Park inexplicably closes down; there are guards, something's hap-
pened.

No clues then, but this happening. What could be on the run. Later, two
people are captured, he doesn't understand. There's a celebration in the
city involving a wheeled boat which capsizes against chains of humans
carrying placards of waves. People are really injured and the clinic's on
hand.

He finds food, stays in her place. He's ill-at-ease, a woman comes wear-
ing a veil and he pays the rent, holding up the currency of his country.
He's surprised how little everything costs. He should feel as if he were
now a part of her life, the woman who was going to meet him, but he does-
n't. He might wear a bracelet or necklace one day. He wears her jumpers,
goes out aimlessly. He thinks, it's all come to a halt here.

He finds himself listening to himself finding himself, but he's not lost.
Just that there is this constant wonder at the world. He's more in love
with her than ever before. One day, he goes to a screening of silent
films, Melies. Women are disappearing all over the place. He'll make a
film about a magician, a woman who brings men back to life. The woman
trance-trains, has visions. Then she sets up mechanisms, everyone knows
all of this and she's quite successful. She dies. Her extras are out of
work, lifeless. They form a secret circle. They keep her corpse, have
visions, try to raise the dead. They have visions, but they don't trance-
train, in fact they do nothing at all. She comes back to life.

There's a knock at the door of the flat. He's been there for months, un-
recognizable. His nights, her days. His days, her nights. Whammo-kazowie,
she's at the door. It would be presumption to ask. She talks about vis-
ions, what she knows. Beneath the flat, there are missile silos. Next
door, enigma code writers are hard at work. Across the way, the buildings
are part of the largest ship ever constructed, you can see the alley-
gangway down to the sea. The ship begins to move, everything shakes for a
minute. The ship stops again, earthquake he says, no she replies.

She's learned everything, signs and symbols. She can't read the cuneiform
either, but insists it isn't important. What comes between the letters,
she confides, that's it more or less. What comes between the letters, he
realizes, is his own alphabet. Everything shudders, they take the Shin-
kansen back to the sheroot stand near the roman ruins. The drivers are
different and perhaps she departs.

But the novel won't go this way. It will be populated with expatriates,
colorful characters named Abdul, Charisma, and Jennifer. They'll drink
a lot and expostulate. There will be all sorts of other horizons strat-
egically across going-native. Sarongs and turbans, veils for the women,
who would and wouldn't. There are fires on the other side of the city -
they never come nearer. Guerillas, one opines. They listen to the short-
wave, marry local, leave one by one. They fan out across the city.

No, they don't, nothing like that happens. There are clues to the woman's
disappearance. The airport appears to be a mechanism of some sort, the
runways laid out in shamanic configuration, easy hiragana squared off for
the takeoff and approach. The stewards knew he was arriving. The pilots
watch him, uneasily, warily, he can't help noticing. Whatever is afoot
takes him by surprise. Nausea, fear.

And then, the rest of the novel. Things happen, everything's written in a
wonderful realism carrying the reader to and fro among strange and mar-
velous events. The reader's excited, always thinking about what will
happen next. The characters are strongly drawn. The plot thickens and
thins. Local color! Naturalism! An ending no one will ever forget!

Fragmeant


Travis wrote to her. The time and return was .465 seconds on average, not
bad when Fukuoka had been considered the center of the world in the four-
teenth century, his own hometown unknown, fallow, untended. He was aware
of the gaping maw of the sun, violent lunacy of the swinging moon which
rarely showed its face - from its night, the radiance of her day showed
forth. Mesmeric, he adapted himself to her schedule, his sun-up suppers
with his friends were the occasion of back-channel conversations about
sanity and the diameter of the earth. He joked he was the only one aware
of circumference, of what a sphere was and meant - that he was the only
one earth-bound, everyone else walking with stitched eyes and habits
formed from childhood. He knew the sphere of stars and its awkwardness,
how it shuddered above and below the equator, the rings of luminescent
star-clouds and their satellites, give and take of unknown constellations.

But it was his doubling that fascinated him, breakfast as dusk rose, not
dawn, sleeping at odd hours reflecting gaps and silences, and his Monday
night class that began oddly enough on Tuesday morning at seven - he re-
mained surprised that the students were alert, keen on the speed of the
Net, which should have been accountably slow and clumsy.

His clocks gained a minute, lost a minute. He tried to meet himself half-
way, like a friend. His nights were bright with untoward clarity, unthun-
dered days, dark, uncanny, silent. Someone fixed the stars, he thought,
they were never when they were supposed to be.

She wrote him about the llamas.

__________________________________________________________________________



Llamas


The llama glistened, black carapace covered within insistent tortoise
plates gleaming in the brown air of noon. It didn't move. Sirens in the
distance constantly changing, warding off violent cars close to veering
out of control. The head turned. Smoke from the nostrils, soot-nose
beneath glowering eyes, body tensed with radiant energy. Shimmered waves
of heat rose from the back, the breath, the brow.

She noted this in her brown notebook, ruled with blue lines. She wrote him
about the llamas near the Shikuneem, vicinity of Kasuga-Shi. They were
llamas, Luria, she was a tracker with a blue felt hat, sorobon and note-
book, penning ebb and flow, turbulent streams of animals burrowing into
the world. They were moving in from the arroyos south-west of the city,
the burning-plains traveled only by the Shinkansen. It was said that bones
sparkled as the trains rushed by, straight unbuckled rails held up to the
sanded grounds too hot for human touch.

Travis remembered her uneasy witnessing, now the thing before him, as if
produced by the cuneiform inscriptions everywhere in his vicinity. It was
a one world, transitive, her llama text taking root, hair, and bone; she
was nowhere to be found. Had she left him these animals, created by pure
description? Was her disappearance contained in the eye of the beast, the
vestiges of retinal memory destroyed by the fire next time? For a second
he felt the creature recognized him, but that second passed, replaced by
the uncertain knowledge that he was losing her trail as the purely exotic
began its uneasy hold.

Did she watch from the grey-pink building tiled against the sky? Did she
lay harbor-dead, trolled by fish and crustacean, memory lost and tangled
in kelp, seed-pods of aquatic plants adapting to stratified pollutions
dragged from shore to sea-bottom and back again?

Travis found his language tangled as well, the product of uncertainty,
loneliness, and an ignorance so pure he had no name for it.

Parting the Thirty-Fourth


Clara reached over for her box of cigarettes; if Avi didn't leave soon,
all hell would break loose. He'd already fallen off the futon three times
in the night, what would you expect from a gaijin who faded in and out of
the desert weekly.

The Desert Weekly, lead story: Gaijin loses grip on wadi edge, plunges two
meters to gravel pitstop, slight remains of moisture lapped by desert
frogs. Pictures, page 2.

When he left, she turned on the radio, cd player, computer, called the
airport, Fukuoka International. The name for city was 'ir,' Fukuoka-Ir
carved in cuneiform on the corner lintels everywhere. They never let you
forget. Flight 75, San Francisco, Oregon, Nepal, Catalina Island, Oman,
Fukuoka-Ir in that order. It was on time and she imagined the plane poised
perfectly in a planetary ring, waiting for the moment to descend. She
dressed, left the bet-ie, headed down the street.

The llamas were waiting as she stepped into the troika. She headed out on
Number One Highway, south, left on Shogun. She hadn't worn her hat, see,
for quite some time now. They stopped by the marshes, approximately five
kilometers from the terminal. She watched the plane make perfect descent,
dialed Robert immediately, continued on her way.

When Robert answered the phone, Jane was in the other room. They spoke in
whispers, aha. She told him all about the recent demographics, head-
counts. Later he'd say she was nervous, preoccupied. He was a specialist
in cartoucherie, useful where the only secure mode of communication was
still clay-based. Lady Sarashina had written

 Were it not for river rock and pine
  This clay would not have impressed
   My name, my love, your _hon_

or book, mnemonics of his mind, to whom she had written, borrowing from
Chinese Ch'in-fu, the impress of the reed pen, striations of thought as
the seven strings, seventeen vibratos, sounded, then faded into ma. Clay
into thought, material into the silence of the word, all this heaven.

Clara was circumscribed by Robert's interest in her demographics, by the
movements of llamas across the burning plains, by the distance of the
troika (found by the side of the road) from the airport. Her disappearance
dissolved into the gaze of Travis, waiting for her, waiting and waiting -
a gaze transformed into a glance, then the look-see of astonishment as he
began to understand she might never meet him again. Would he remember her
voice, enumerating herds, packs, gaggles, schools, flocks, enervated
groupings of the awkward black mammals, their armor-plating clacking in
the heat of the day?

Every one of these people were breathing, in and out.

Clara turned over lazily, suddenly realizing what had happened. She woke
with a start in utter darkness. The worst had happened. "Travis," she
said, uncertainly, "Travis."

'Yes,' he replied, as a hand slid along her arm, her face, her hair. "I'm
here, darling, I'm here."

I have been living on a bank of the Mekong River for 35 years and I would
like to thank you, Kali, for your editorial perspective and commitment.

I am new to the internet and its attendant communities; I had not seen the
websites indicated in your recent communication.  I read the poetry
samplings in the White Noise series in tears.  I spent 11 years of my
childhood in Laos during the war and have spent much of my time writing to
process what I experienced there and after as a result of it.  I had not
thought that it mattered to much of anyone except those of us who struggle
with it out here.

Rain

rain's nimbus, moribund sky
monsoon morning dims the day

flooding fields, fragile seedlings
set within a pale reflection

wounded waters flowing blood
bathe the streambed still

heart's constriction
memory's mark of war

silent came the rain
revengeful came the rain

flat and grey and mourning
we were the nimbus of rain

our hearts were flooded with tears
bathed in pools of blood

there was plenty of death
left for the rest of us

planting our fields
preparing our meals lonely

touching our children
to keep them near

our eyes and mouths were full with rain
a dull reflection in the growing fields

for what harvest did we live
through raintime to the dry

i've been pretty busy lately with things that keep me far away from my own

but before running off i decided to go through some of the recent backlog
of messages and found a few posts this weekend that were genuinely sweet.

so thanks to kali and juliana and david (bromige if there's other davids to

others lately.

Steve,

read your note with interest.  Catherine's reading at Brown was, even for
her, unusually luminous.  I was really quite surprised at the range of
speech acts it embodied and the hi-res detail she communicated so naturally
and easily.

Mirroring perhaps your or one of your experiences of _Pitch_, on my first
reading I felt it was an animated cognitive map which, yes, sounds exciting,
but, on its own, can also be thin enough fare.  I've heard her read from
this book quite a few times at this stage, never the same twice.  Maurice
Scully mentioned once in conversation that he felt that syntax was a pivot
for her, which she used to underpin multiple readings.  Her fragmented
phrasing, on the Brown reading, did however seem to depend on a very acute
ear for what happens in speech as opposed to writing.

Yes, two important strands in understanding her work, the psychic flow and
talking in the wild.  As you say, one is left relatively cueless, which I
think is a formal necessity insofar as her verse is capable of withstanding
many different and highly articulate readings.  Billy Mills, in a paper in
which he writes of Catherine's work among that of others, mentions landscape
and history as two other threads.  I get a feeling that landscape for
Catherine is at least four never mind two dimensional.  That somehow,
history leaves a spatial trace.  Sounds like nonsense, but when actually
reading the stuff, that's how it feels.

It seems too, like one of those optical illusion things, is it a vase? is it
a face?, that whichever of the possible multiple readings strikes one at a
particular time is utterly compelling.  Now that _is_ something.

Thanks for reminding me of her magnificent reading.

Best wishes,

Randolph Healy.

As for the space, editing and funding of journals, it is always a
semi-slimy but wondrous work and one gets as much flack as praise for such
collaborations.  I for one would want to applaud and give thanks for the
work of Juliana Spahr et al in CHAIN whose vision is capacious yet
exacting, whose work is devoted to opening herself/the US poetry scene to
"the outside" in some full international and material-language sense. The
range of her editing speaks for itself, and no attempt to discredit her or
the work she does editing and writing will work, as she will rise from the
grave of such lack of perception.  TINFISH is another such journals,
capacious yet exacting in opening and linking the inner Pacific to a
global/local range of experimental (and social-cultural poetics).  Susan
Schultz has devoted much time, love and energy to this, and we are
grateful at home and afar.  I wanted to tell this list about another
editor and journal you may not know of:  the Japanese/US writer from
Kyotot and now in Seattle, Keijiro Suga.  He was one of the key voices in
the journal of mixed and mongrel ethnographic poetics called "Melimelo"
which came out of Kyoto and gave an alternative voice to the mixes of
Japan and Japan and Chicano-rich America.  Jim Clifford have me a copy of
that journal, and it changed around my own view of place/poetics as more a
matter of routes and flows than just roots and entrenchments.  Now Keijiro
Suga has opened up a spendidly designed and colorfully edited journal on
the web.  It is called "Taxi!" and the four or five issues done so far
help to flesh out his vision of poetics as something always "on the road"
and in a state of travel to some edge  of mixture. His taxi is quite
singular and exacting.  "Taxi!" can be found at this address:
http://www2c.meshnet.or.jp/~taxi/
I would urge Charles Bernstein and Loss Pequeno to check it out as a
candidate for the EPC journals page.
And on this Sunday, always written under the sign of our Lady of
Guadalupe, let us give praise to journals like Chain and Central Park and
Taxi! and let the Hudson Review and Poetry drone on in their market
blindness as our lady, say, ever intended it would be,
gnostically yours in the US market.

thinking on this question of what used to be called "discriminating"
readers (steve's suggestive post), in light of hoa's observations re her
status as part of (say) somehow contrary publishing outlets...

i don't want to suggest a direct analogy here, in what i'm going to say...
or even an analogy... but i do want to take this opportunity to raise an
issue re gender, one that i live daily with as a result of where i teach...

i'm on a tech campus, where it's 80% men... and i teach predominantly
engineers, a profession that is (at best) currently running about 85%
men...

so i'm faced in my classes with a small percentage of women who aspire to
belong (and i'll construct it this way to advance the problem as quickly as
i can) to a predominantly male-occupied profession...

now i don't have to say (but i will!) that i view this as a Good
Thing---these women who aspire to becoming engineers... that i (and i
assume we) would all like to see a more representative quotient of women
(for one) in a profession that has such an incredible impact on our daily
lives [he sez]...

and yet, and yet (as i just posted a listmember backchannel the other day):
i would like the profession to be less male, but i would also like women
to question their desires, chart a path that has less to do with mimicking
male behavior per se than with being passionate and critical as to
technology, and explore their potential in *altering* the profession for
the better, which might perhaps entail working against certain behaviorally
male realities (of course i ask much the same of men!)... i would
challenge, that is, the women as to their possible, male-identified
behavior (b/c i regard male as the dominant group)... i would challenge the
women who persist in sitting with the men in class, who shy away from the
few other women in attendance... the women who just want to be "one of the
guyz," who tell me they "don't really like women"... the same women who on
occasion dress in extremely provocative feminine garb---though i must be
certain not to over-generalize here, and though i must observe that the
implicit fashion binary here is a sort of catch-22...

now to bring this on over to publishing:  clearly, hoa, you are not to be
condemned or some such for having had writing 'picked up' by a primarily
"male journal" (and neither is dale to be condemned for publishing/editing
same, though i trust i've made it clear that i'd like to see a bit more
reflexiveness on dale's part in this regard)... but i have noticed, at the
same time, that in my own aspirations to be published by thus & so, i've
been (perhaps rightfully) challenged by friends and poets as to the basis
of my own aspirations, on the basis of the sort of publishing reality such
& such effects...

i would certainly begin to doubt mself were i to find my work published,
say, in a neo-nazi newsletter... perhaps some of you will object to my
self-doubt here, but so it goes... i don't want to see my website linked to
such a website, either...

so my question for the list is---and again trying like hell to steer clear
of the analogy i seem to have supplied, sorry (i'm confident re my teaching
situation, and even engineering, but i'm never so confident re my
publishing aspirations)---how do you each value "discriminating" these days
on the basis, for example, of gender?... in fact, how do you each value
your aspirations?... i hope this is not beside the point, though i know
some of you will want to keep the writing process as such distinct from
such considerations... very well then, ex post facto, if you must...

and as to questions of emotional attachment/disengagement/affect:  i'd
simply like to observe that this would seem to reflect the age-old anxiety
about knowledge... about how "knowing too much" is alleged to 'spoil'
certain formerly innocently (?--edenic, i know) conceived appreciations of
art etc... this is encapsulated in the anti-theoretical stance of many
'creative writers' i've met... and henry in particular (!)---i'm using
"anti-theoretical" to mean "anti-reflexive"---theorizing in its broadest
terms, not "anti-academic-theoretical"...

to which i might offer my own sense of things:  that for me, there is no
question, all said and done, of trying to permit my emotions the freeplay
requisite to creating... and that writing has become for me a process of
intellection (and in this sense critical, and urgent) even as it must of
necessity be an enactment and embodiment of feeling... i mean to say, that
this is what i think i'm doing when i'm creating---thinking and feeling...
and what i think i'm doing is at least relevant to the extent that this is
how i come to my own work... now what others may make of the results is
another matter, for others are, though present, an imagined presence when
i'm in the process...

best,

joe

        Maria, I hear you, but I still hold to the notion that the one
sure-fire way to asess the effectiveness of any aesthetic is to asess its
power to let you empathize.  All literature teaches this, in one way or
another, or am I just an old softy?

yes and no: i find that empathy, for me, isn't a "natural." i have to learn
the language of exchange before i'm aware of the content; not just the
content or language in terms of intellection or syntax, but the conventions
of communicative exchange for *that* text, or recitation, or cultural
event.  renato rosaldo has a wonderful essay (can't remember the name of it
or where it appeared) where he talked about learning to listen during his
fieldwork.  he said the Ilongot people he was living with would tell
stories that comprised simply a recitation of place names; he felt
incredibly bored and frustrated, while they were weeping.  then he learned
the stories behind the placenames; they were the places where, in fleeing
from the japanese during WWII, various members of the tribe had lost
individual family members, or had encountered other significant events
associated with that period of their collective memory.  then he was able
to understand how to empathize.  i remember reading this as a grad student
and realizing that i had no idea how to listen with that degree of
openness; i was so eager to jump in with an analysis, a critique or an
evaluative judgment that i often missed the context or subtext entirely.
so, to paraphrase george lipsitz, i need to constantly learn to listen as
well as listen to learn.  i find also (and this is a truism, but not to be
overlooked) that my ability to empathize is a delicate one, often dependent
on my health, degree of serenity, amount of sleep i've gotten, etc.  it
doesn't come from the power of "the work itself."

Hey, Kali, welcome back! It's OK to say love, I think, but then I'm no
authority. I do know that I have to at least like the stuff I publish
simply because I can't afford to publish everything. Too much time & money
goes into it, and it's my time & money! Agreed also that the causes of
like/love aren't always so simple to predict. I know I sometimes publish
something because it irritates me, or because it is so far from something I
could conceive of having written myself. All sorts of reasons. Pheromonal
aesthetics--there's one to contemplate. best, Sylvester

How is life in the eastern edges of existence <grin>.  Actually, I'm pretty
fed up with Texas myself, but it's harder for me to bail.  I'm probably
bailing on the Word.  I've got one guy to meet with Tuesday night to see if
he's interested in taking on the pub, but that probably won't fly.  Gwen
said the stuff wouldn't install on your box, but if you could mail the
stuff back to me (I knew I should've made a copy), I'll install it on my K6
box & hack up a review.  Cool box.  AMD 200 MMX, 24x CD, Soundblaster 64,
33.6 modem(fast enuf...), blah blah.  I even got --in spite of the lack of
SCSI-- Red Hat to install.  Just need to high speed scsi stuff, the 17 inch
monitor & the CD burner & I'll be go.  Maybe a hot rod video card later.
Ought to hold off that dual/quad processor urge till BeOS Intel & NT 5.0
hit...

BTW, I picked up a book recently that's bizarre/intriguing/something: The
Bible Code.  The author has written for the NY Times & the Wall Street
Journal.  Anyway, the book documents the work of a mathematician in Israel
who found a skip sequence code in the first five books of the Bible (the
Pentateuch -sp- I believe).  The statistics were published in a journal on
statistics.  Thoughts?  Curiousity?  Yawns?

take care,

This comment reminds of a couple of other comments on this list regarding
funding and the imperative to strive for some kind of racial/sexual
diversity (I hate the word gender).  More than one guy on this list has
said something like, "Hey, Mr. X doesn't get grant money so he can publish
whomever he likes."  Obviously any publisher can and does publish whomever
s/he likes.  There seems to be some underlying implication that without
grant money and its general insistance upon diversity that one has no moral
imperative to be open to a broader range of possibilities.  Dale says he
only has 90 pages so he can't diversity, yet he criticizes Chain, which
does diversify, for being too long.  ?????????

I also find offensive here that people have been bragging about the people
of color whom they know and/or have published--I mean how condescending can
you get.  I think Hoa is much too nice to this list in her posts.  Nobody
wants to be turned into a pet.

I'm much moved by Maria's last post, the honesty of it, concerning her
struggles to learn to be open/empathetic.

Joe Lemis forgot to mention that --assuming two pubs by the same name don't
travesty the face of the Earth-- that "News of the Weird" is published by
Joe Bob Briggs, self-described 'drive in movie critic of Grapevine, Texas'.
 Nothing like some harmless New Orleans weirdness to make a Texan feel
better.  <wink>
    I think it's more interesting to note the demand for iambic pentameter.
 I think that an interpretation of poetry that narrow --and some would say
dated-- says more about the state of poets and their community than it says
about the perceived public ignorance.
    I've heard any number of variants of the 'death of poetry' argument and
I'm still not convinced that we can say more on that point than that poetry
is not the integral part of American public discourse that it is in other
countries.  I'm constantly amazed by the amount of interest by Joe Public
in poetry.  I'm not amazed at how quickly poets seem to kill that interest
through grand standing, lack of emotional investment in their work, lack of
interest in the the work of others (past & present) and lack of involvement
in the poetry community.
    Perhaps we need letter bombs demanding sound poetry...

Dodie, it's true that I'm a guy on the list. I didn't say anything about
"people of color" ( a phrase I never use, because it's as bad as "colored
people," in my estimation. I'm open to all sorts of possibilities, I hope,
and love moral imperatives. I don't even require that the people I publish
use words. Don't lump people to bash them, do it one-by -one. That's a good
moral imperative, isn't it? I mean, if bash you must?

oh no, we're gonna have a pissing contest again!...

listen folks, sylvester and dodie and and and:  "people of color," whatever
its problems, is not no way uh-uh publicly understood (as a rule) as "as
bad as colored people"... and "gender," no matter how much you may dislike
same (and lord knows why, b/c the word has a history of usage that's quite
specific and specifically useful and does something different than
"sexual") is a perfectly legit way to deal with issues of GENDER...

Yup, as English IS the language of the oppressors we should stop using
english. Or even semaphore, morse. Perhaps all talk in sign language. Sorry
for the facisiousness, i don't think she has at all. Just pointed out the
cringe factor in phrases such as my "black friend" or my "my gay friend".
Not something i have ever been guilty of as i don't have any friends. - Also
not something anyone has really been doing. I feel mt cannon has come loose

"Brag:  to talk boastfully about oneself.  'Boast' is the most general
of the verbs for the expression of vanity, primarily by vocal means.
'Brag,' used in more informal contexts, implies exaggerated claims,
blatancy, and oftenan air of insolence." -- _American Heritage Dictionary
of the American Language_

Seems to me that what we've got here is a group of people trying to speak
honestly and carefully about a loaded, emotional minefield of a subject
in which everyone has a personal stake.

I wrote:

so I assume Dodie is not referring to me, since I explicitly state that I'm
not interested in token poets or token friends.  But I can't figure out who
else might be her target here, since I haven't noticed anyone who might be
doing anything akin to "bragging."  Wrestling, maybe.  But not bragging.

As a white African Americanist, I'm used to people looking at me funny when
I talk about African American culture(s) or African American poetry, or even
my African American friends.  My black friends.  My friends who are persons
of color. Liberal types are so hyped up to cringe when they hear echoes of
"some of my best friends are 'X'" that they can't hardly hear "my friend
who is African American" without assuming it's some sort of trophy claim.
What?  Am I supposed to have black friends without acknowledging, somehow,
that they are black?  That being black matters to them and, therefore,
matters to me? What sort of friend would I be then?  How could we talk
to each other about our lives?  Or am I supposed to be satisfied with
having no black friends because every time I seek the company of an
African American colleague some people are going to presume that I'm
doing it *just* because she's black?  I quit worrying what other people
think about this stuff a long, long time ago.  I know who my friends
are, and they know who I am, and that's how we play it, and if I've
got anything to prove, I need to prove it to my friends and not to
a stranger who hears ghosts in my words.

Friendship is about caring enough for another person to want to
understand who and what they are, when and where they enter--it's about
caring enough to try to put your own shit aside for a while and deal with
*their* shit.  It's about recognizing the distance between you as well
as the points of contact. It's about... well, dammit, it's about love.
Just as, for me, poetry is about love.  In that sense, I approach poems and
people the same way. I take them in context, try to understand where they
come from, the traditions upon which they draw, their relative power, their
interests and agendas, the stucture of their understanding of the world,
the grace with which they move through that world, the payment they demand,
the gifts that they bear.  And if I feel that diversity--in people and in
poetry--increases the richness and the beauty and the pain and the
intensity
of the life that I live, and if I want to sing the praises of such diversity,
of that kind of love, why is that a problem?

And sure I know that I've got privileges my African American
friends will never have--and they know that too, you better believe it.
I know I don't like it, but they know and I know that pretending I don't
have those privileges benefits nobody, while using them to open doors
when I can, and not abusing them at all other times is the responsibility
I bear for being born privileged and the absolute minimum qualification I've
got to meet before I'm worthy of their friendship... or anybody else's.
Another way I interpret that responsibility is to carry my friends--all
of them--always with me, and to never complacently inhabit places where
they are not welcome and would not be comfortable.  This means, when I'm
in an all-white venue, that I can't tolerate the levels of racism which
are comfortable for many white people, and which--because they are white
--even well-meaning white folks often don't notice.  And it means, when
I'm in the company of lesbian feminist friends, that I can't tolerate
certain kinds of WhiteHetMale bashing, either.  Insisting on diversity
is, for me, ensuring that I'll endure a certain level of discomfort in
almost any venue, but, on the other hand, it also brings me deep and
richly satisfying relationships with very different people.  It's all a
matter of what's important to you and who you are willing to love.

And why shouldn't we talk about that?

My question to you Joe, is why would you allow yourself to be published in
a series of straight white working class men?  Don't you feel you're being
turned into a cartoon?  I can't talk for people of color but I can talk as
a working class person and I certainly wouldn't want to be published as a
Working Class Woman.  Like yuck.

Don't you feel like your allowing yourself to be victimized by an imperialist?

Went to a reading the other night and I saw Steve Carll there.  I asked
him, why no more reports on Poetics List.  (for you who are new to Poetics
List I should explain that SF poet Steve Carll used to come on here all the
time and give reports on every reading he had been to, and that means
plenty!)  He shrugged and said he unsubscribed.  I said I would try to fill
in for him.  First Leslie Scalapino read.  (I can't remember all the
different lines Steve used to quote from, so I will try to describe the
story lines instead.)  She read six poems from a sequence called "New Time"
which I had not heard, then launched into the beginning of something she is
calling a detective novel.  Its title is "Orchid Jetsam."  The two main
characters, Grace Abe and Andrew Chen, work in the San Francisco Police
Department and are investigating a strange murder case.  Abe is
additionally burdened (or enhanced) by the fact she is being possessed by
the spirit of a Marine slain in the Gulf War Desert Storm who enters her
body at inopportune times during the investigation.  I asked Scalapino if
she was riffing off the "X Files" because it certainly had that spooky the
truth is out there kind of feeling about it.  She said no, in fact she had
never seen the "X Files" and you know something, I believed her!  Anyway as
usual a reading filled with great theatrical powers of "explaining" those
long involved sentences and fragments of sentences, explaining them by
keeping them balanced like the balls of the juggler, up in the air till she
wants them to come down in the right or skewed places, through the voice
and a subtle movement of the fingers of her left hand.

Then Edwin Torres came on.  It was an interesting gamble to see if these
two poets would work together successfully and one that seemed to
invigorate them both.  Torres used a boombox to play background chants and
orchestral thumps and thwacks while reciting poetry and sounds over the
recorded sounds.  Many young people in the audience responded favorably to
this combination, one woman told me that this was the best reading she had
ever heard in her life.  The words came often from Torres new book
"SandHommeNomadNo" and a forthcoming CD "Holy Kid" (Kill Rock Stars label).
Torres who had never read before in San Francisco seemed pleased and
abashed by his reception.  We will be sorry to see him go back to New York,
but around here, nobody stays for very long, they are all dust in the wind.
You think you will have stability in your life, but you don't.  It's a fact
of life in San Francisco that all must deal with sooner or later.  The
poetry reflects this.  Torres was always doing all this formalistic
stuff--breaking words down into phonemes and distorting them by combining
them, say, with animal imitations or the high energy vernacular of a dozen
different NY street cultures-- but it was always infused with emotional
intensity and a certain variety of timbre . . .  some of the sounds he
emitted could only be heard by dogs.  In this way, I feel, his writing
appeals to a broad range of people, and when read on the page feels a bit
abandoned, as though the reader is getting only half of the dimensions;
however, in "SandHommeNomadNo" this lack, or absence, is partially
softened--just like life--by typography and in fact--the slowness with
which the words are read gives them back the "meaning" they lose in
performance.

So, is it six of one and half a dozen of the other?  Or 12 of both, either
way?  And now for the real Steve Carllism, who was in the audience!  There
were so many people in the audience I didn't recognize half of them.
Perhaps they were fans of the spoken word movement, and some were
definitely students of Mills College and the Art Institute, places where
Scalapino has been teaching lately.  And of New College, because students
there can get in free (this was a reading sponsored by Small Press
Traffic.)  I saw Pamela Lu, Rick London, Liz Willis, Peter Gizzi, Mary
Margaret Sloan, Rodrigo Toscano, Hung Tu, Mary Burger, Lyn Hejinian, Simone
Fattal, Bob Gluck, Jocelyn Saidenburg, Aaron Shurin, Hugh Steinberg,  and
sixty or seventy others.

Yes, that is something. I don't know her work, but...this could be a
description of most any verse. I gather from your excitement that she is,
however, more deliberate than most. Is that right? If so, this
deliberateness would be an essential quality of what she is doing. I like
that idea. But is it illusion? We could as easily call it a manifestation
of quantum theory, if we liked those kind of metaphors, or a particular
method of embodying consciousness, if we preferred those. Using the term
"optical illusion" is akin to placing consciousness in quotes. Something
has to place the quotes. Might as well dive right in and be at sea, because
as far as I can ascertain we are anyway.

Thanks for the good insights.

Best,

Dodie,

Joe can answer this himself, I'm sure.  In fact, we spoke of your post
briefly on the phone tonight, since it flashed across my screen as we
traded news about our lives and talked about the important stuff--work,
relationships, new ideas, hopes, fears, the stories you share with friends.
The phone rang almost immediately again after I hung up.  It was Renny
Christopher, whose book of poetry, _Viet Nam and California_ is now in
press and will be the second volume published by Burning Cities / Viet Nam
Generation in 1997.  I read Renny your post and she started to laugh.
Renny is just finishing up the task of editing a special issue on working
class studies for the journal _Feminist Studies_.  She calls herself a
working class poet and a working class scholar and doesn't find the
title "yuck" in the least. There's a range of sentiment about the label
"working class," just like there's a range of sentiment about any label--
people have different ideas about who they are and how they want to be
recognized.

Working Class Studies is a burgeoning field populated (no surprise) mostly
by working class scholars, or scholars who identify with or spring from
the working class. Working class anthologies (including anthologies
of poetry and literature) are showing up all over--the commercial
presses may indeed exploit working class writers, but the small press
and academic anthologies don't seem to have any trouble filling their
pages with good writing by people who are proud to be published as
working class writers.  Me, I don't have any problem being published as
"X", as long as it's done respectfully and I feel that I, as an "X" have
some say in the process and by participating gain some personal benefit
and some benefit for "X"s in general.

What you're forgetting here, Dodie, is that Joe is a friend of mine. It's
you who boils down the White Noise series to some cartoonish population
of working class WhiteHetMale poets, not me.  I know each of those poets
(David Connolly, Elliot Richman, David Vancil, Gerald McCarthy, Joe Amato,
Dale Ritterbusch, Philip Jason, M.L. Liebler), and I count each of them a
friend, respect each one for who he is and what of himself he is willing
to share with me and with his readers. These poets' whiteness and maleness
are not the *reasons* for publishing them, and I wouldn't swear that every
single one is straight or that each and every one qualifies as "working
class," (who am I, after all, to issue certifications?), but there is a
unifying theme or "feel" to their work which seems to me well characterized
by White Noise. Part of their intensity, and strength is born out of a
rejection of a particular stereotype of white maleness, out of a reaction
to a cultural location, and there is, in each poet's work, a kind of
courage I admire, a level of sensibility and emotion and commitment that
seems to me worthy of notice and praise.  Most important, though, I think
they are all fine poets, and I am proud to have helped to bring their
work to an audience. If you read the series, it might give you some insight
into my project and a deeper understanding of their work.  They are no
fools, no dupes, no victims, and would laugh at anyone who told them
different.

Why go after me with such ferocity?  Or, rather, if you care to go after
me with this ferocity, I'd prefer to take it back-channel, to discuss it
with you as one human being to another, rather than playing it out as
street theater.  POETICS has been the site of too many pitched battles
between people who would make better allies than enemies.  A Sixties
scholar, I can't help making a comparison to the splintering of progressive
groups like SDS, who spent so much time infighting they weren't left
with enough energy or a cohesive enough community to take effective action
to change a system everyone in all factions agreed was evil.  I've been
as guilty (and maybe more guilty) of such infighting as anyone else, but
I'm honestly tired of it and I'm no longer going to participate in such
struggles.

Peace,
Kali

dodie

did you read my post as "bragging about people of color i know?"  part of
me thinks you can't possibly have gone down THAT path, but after the cycles
of wierdness, anything is beginning to seem possible.

if not, sorry to have asked.

if so, go back and read it again.  i bring it up as analog to gender inclusion/
exclusion using a parallel situation in my life at present where at first
glance, the issue seems racial.  and my response is anger, and seems along
racial lines.  but when i go back and make myself be more objective, make
lists and describe this dilemna to very objective, analytic friends, a number
of other factors start coming in and soon, it reduces to one group of people
blanking out another.  not attacking, exactly (though they whisper and
snigger occasionally) but having a smooth, flat, reflectant surface whenever
they are in proximity to group (in this case, black, but also older, with
kids, largely 1rst/2nd generation immigrants, working, poor, etc being
blindsided by group largely opposite in every respect mentioned).  as with
this, so with the poet first mentioned -- he describes a lack of authentic
poetry, turns to one sort, and seems completely obvlivious, blank sided,
smooth flat and reflectant-surfaced to an entire, huge body of poetry based
on authentic and universal experience (new movement in womens writing).
the blindness, non-seeing, may not be as simple as you black/female/other
vs. me white/male/my sort.  it may not exactly be malice, deserving of
and responsive to anger but something more complex.

in support of last thought, i offer the often-seen response of "there is no
poetry of X type out there" when shown a huge volume of poetry by, lets say
women for this example, of X type with promise for much more.  response, more
often than not, is another wierd compendium: "oh, wow, this is great" and then
responder does not look up any more and a few weeks later, repeats statement
about no poetry of X type.

blank spot, smooth reflectant surface, non-seeing...  thus, the white women
in my school (not all but most) sit at lab one day with one of the black
women (and it is black, not "of color" although, interestingly, we have one
indian (india) woman who seems to be treated the same as the black women),
they'll laugh, share books, have fun, get stuff done, and one hour later,
ONE HOUR, and white woman X goes right by her former lab partner at lunch
without one single glance and goes to sit next to other white woman she hardly
knows.

blank spot?  non-seeing?  there does'nt seem malice, just blankness...

Just a note of thanks to Steve Evans for his remarkably thoughtful
meditation on reading prejudices.  I read it having just visited a good
friend, an older poet whom most of us on this list (including myself)
would categorize as "mainstream," but whose open-mindedness as a reader
I've always appreciated.  He told me he'd begun reading Perelman's
*Virtual Reality* after someone, in addition to myself, had recommended
it. He'd more or less given up on "language poets" long ago.  He said, "If
two people who aren't dumb tell me I should read something, I figure I've
just missed it, that I haven't found a way into the poems yet."  That's
laconic and 'Yankee' of him, to be sure - a methodology which will keep
him from reading any number of worthwhile poets.  Still, he was reading
Perelman 'hard,' as carefully as he knew how.  And, there seemed to be
something to this - what we're able to find our way into, who we're able
to read with some sense of pleasure, depends so much on how wide our nexus
of associations/associates is.  Which is to say, poetry is a communicative
possibility which depends on a whole host of other communicative acts.
Steve's gift seems to be a faith that the communicative acts of others
(Walsh for instance) are never intended as monologue, always as dialogue.
Anyway, thanks Steve, for letting us eavesdrop.

-Mike.

As many have already said, this has been a fine thread, pushing thought, &
I too am grateful for all the considered responses.

I am reminded of bpNichol's suggestion that there are a number of different
poetics, the researchers, those who learn quickly from them & follow up the
original research, those who continue to maintain the classic stances, work
through the continuing possibilities of 'convention' (as with feminismS or
postodernismS there are a LOT of conventional sites & states -- we cant
situate everyone in one box, even in that third category). I wonder if this
doesnt apply to reading too (& perhaps editing as such). I also wonder if
we can't move between or among the 'levels' as bp, a most generous reader
of everyone, often did. It can be called eclecticism but it doesnt have to
be mealylouthed. I like Steve Evan's take because it suggests one of the
ways such a move happens. I certainly have learned to 'like' some writing I
wasnt sure of through hearing the writer read the work, & have sometimes
learned of work I didnt even know existed that way. Always a good moment
when that happens.

So what I 'like' & would publish may very well change (broaden?) over time.
I have had so many limited definitions of 'good' poetry that some new poem
has destroyed, forced me to braoden the definition, over the years. For the
work that broke the bias I am always grateful... But the bias is a place to
start: having some sense of what touches me, moves me, gets me thinking,
etc. And then I need to be open to the possibility that I can change.

In response to Juliana on the 50/50 m/w breakdown in _Chain_, I am reminded
of an article by Samuel R Delany some 25 years ago at least, in which he
pointed out that, despite his feeling that he was thoroughly 'for' women's
equality, he discovered that when he was in a crowd of people & thought the
number of women was equal to the number of men, he would count & find that
really the percentage of women was between 10% and a high of 25%. So he
went into perceptual training & found that after some time when he thought
the numbers were equal, it was about 40% women. Yeah.

dodie, i generally joke with my friends about my own cartoonish
qualities... i mean, i love cartoons, can't help mself... i esp. love the
rocky/bullwinkle show, and watch the reruns late at night...

it may be that 'my working class ain't your working class' (to paraphrase
another book/issue)... but let's see... i think, in general, that
categories are necessary conveniences, and therefore dangerous to the
extent that they're used reductively...

i'd sure hate to think that my work is reducible to my working-classness or
some such... but then, no doubt about it---my working-classness or some
such is a strong gradient in *some* of my work...

so let's get up close and personal, ok?...

i published my first poem at 36... my first book of poetry (the one kali
published, a coupla years after we'd met and become friends) at 40... i'm
not part of the mfa circuit (which is notnotnot intended as a slam of said
circuit)---in fact i don't hold the trad. doctorate, i hold a doctor of
arts, or d.a., from suny/albany (which some of you academix out there will
no doubt understand in terms of its various complications---i'm proud of my
degree program, in any case)... kali's commitment to publishing work she
liked, incl. work by a group of whitehetmen (tags used advisedly, now)
resulted in my book being published, w/o my having to publish in more
orthodox OR more avant-garde venues (very little of my book was in print,
actually, before the book was published---with the result that that book,
if you read it closely, is comprised of older, more trad. work in the
front, and newer, less trad. writing toward the 'end'---as ron silliman was
so nice to post me about after reading through)...

now:  i'm working-class to the extent that both my folks were (though my
mother would have graduated college in europe, were it not for the war)...
50s style three bedroom ranch (in the 50s and 60s) until my folks divorced
in 68 and my life REALLY began to take on some rather quirky proportions,
growing up as i did with my father and brother in an upper flat in a
deadended part of edgecity at $75 a month rent (not exactly what you'd call
swanky)... twelve years in that place... welfare foodstamps low wages
alcoholism culminating in cancer death etc etc etc prior to my even
publishing a single fucking poem... well it's almost stereotypical, and in
fact not working-class at all---it's poverty line... but me, i worked only
summer jobs that could be called working class---my aspirations as a worker
were directed at salary positions (the only way 'out' was a career in
engineering), and these aspirations raised anxieties in me not unlike the
ones i occasionally feel when i aspire to publishing hither and thither
(although i must admit it's much easier for me these days)...

but again, i'd hate anybody to think my work (or aesthetic, or self, or
whateverthefuck) reduced to "working class" or "poverty line"... still, you
test me in these terms, you gets what you pays for...

now:  since you've given me the opportunity to rant a bit (and really---if
you know me at all you'll know that the rough edges in this post are
accompanied by a smile---which really tends to piss people off f2f,
*sorry*) i may as well take a moment to plug my own, very working-class
book (as some will no doubt observe upon reading):  _no outlet:  an
engineer in the works_ (i keep tweaking that subtitle, but i like this
one), due out someday i hope on a MAJOR TRADE PRESS, with some real money
accompanying the transaction (and hey, i don't even have an agent yet!)...
and i hope the motherfucker becomes a motherfucking bestseller, you bet
your sweet as i do---

well i'm talking to you *all* now, not just dodie, and you can see how i
get mself into trouble with my big fucking mouth...

i mean, kass and i are tens of thousands in debt on plastic, and there's no
inheritance in the cards, if you get my drift... and i'm getting real tired
of living with this financial pressure, which it seems i've been living
with now since forever... i'm certain many of you can relate...

now i have some doubts about my trade press aspirations, some real
aesthetic and writing community doubts (in my view, a trade press simply
'buys' an audience for you), but i have to say---with the work nearly
complete, in less than a year---i am, to my own surprise, relatively
pleased mself with the results, which seem to complicate my 'working class
self' even while managing to tell some readable (in a more popular sense)
stories...

but hey, i'm the author... and i worry about the reception of my
book---that somebody will pigeonhole the book or me as being specifically
'one a those'... but then, the packaging/publishing aspect is, again, a
categorical (marketplace) convenience, one that i've tried like hell to
keep at arm's length in my own writing (even though of course i know when

Long drive makes me late to these threads:

I find intriguing Kevin Killian's generous/risky practice as editor of
publishing a cross-section of work that slides across his desk into his
rangefinder. (Mirage is thus always pleasurably eclectic. Aldon Nielsen's
lower limit speech has also done this.) Unavoidably, Killian publishes what
he likes, yet it seems the emphasis shifts from editorial predilection to
what his readers might find provocative. He acts less as filter, more as
facilitator. We certainly need magazines like that -- pointing us toward
the panoply so we know more about writing than the editor's aesthetic.

Edwin Honig in his call for a poetry of "lived experience" overlooks the
fact that writing itself is such. If it isn't, why do it? Granted writing
will always be safer than hunkering down in sucking mud with mortar shells
dropping, yet it is no less a living act. I think of what Tim O'Brien says
in The Things They Carried: Story truth is truer than Happening truth. What
occurs in our imaginations as we write and read is more meaningful, more
primary/primal, than the historical events that may or may not trigger our
imaginations. Poetry about history inevitably becomes simply history.
Writers should take us to felt/thought places that have always been and
will always be (even those just coming into cognition), no matter how they
do it.

Following up on Dodie's post/ Kali response re: working class poets

I don't really understand why Dodie's post was read as an attack on Kali
or Joe.  Could it be that Dodie was asking a *real* question of Joe?  I
would like to know how he feels about belonging to the "White Noise"
group-- and I imagine that perhaps Joe would welcome the chance to talk
about his poetry activities and affiliations (?).

I am wondering 2 things-- How come you would feel yuck published in a
"working class women journal", Dodie (a really real question-- I have
questions around this for myself in terms of other identity categories)
and secondly, how come the response to Dodie's post was a longish
defensive complaint, Kali?

Subject:      gender history & the other stuff

Why not dig myself a deeper foxhole & respond again to Elliza's complaint.
She argues or implies that Honig & others like him stereotype experimental
women's writing as unhistorical, abstract, unreadable, & on the other hand
valorize men's writing, vet's writing, as historical, understandable,
in touch with the "authentic" story or stories.

This issue has a long & complex history itself about which I certainly am
no authority.  I just want to say that in my view the issue of realism,
authenticity, representation, history, & empathy need not be divided either
along gender lines or experimental/traditional lines.  I THINK GOOD WRITING
CONTINUALLY CROSSES THESE LINES (as Steve Evan's appreciation of
C. Walsh was pointing toward).  I think the keynote might be what the
"objectivists" pointed toward as a value - sincerity.  What is sincerity but
a measure of the balance achieved by the artist between "experience" and
"art"?  If art is a mimesis or re-experiencing of experience filtered
or tempered by the understanding - the logos - then this balance is
utterly necessary for authentic art.  And everything wavers across that
plumbline.  Between slack repetitions of experience and petty contortions
of technique for its own sake lies the plumbline of authentic art.

Now in my own view - not Mr. Honig's - there is a ton of slack writing on BOTH
sides of that plumbline.  There IS a lot of critical support for "texts"
which equate radical innovation with abstract unreadability.  Elliza's
absolutely right that returning to some kind of group-sanctioned Men's
Version of History is both reactionary & ridiculous.  So Edwin has a complaint
& Elliza has a complaint. Do they have to cancel each other out with mutual
caricatures?  Where is the joy in reading a pedestrian rehash of misunderstood
cliches of so-called experience?  Where is the joy in trying to read some
pedantic ambitious hypocrite's re-working of styles invented by Pound or
Stein & sanctioned by a couple generations of grad schools?  Unless the
poem itself hits the poet over the head in roughly the same degree of
velocity & ferocity that life itself hits us all over the head from day one
well I say why read it.    - Henry Gould

This is an important point, but maybe the reason I keep saying "classicism
is revolution" & steff like that is that I don't exactly agree with Tim
O'Brien, & I don't exactly agree that poetry about history inevitably
becomes "simply" history.  I do agree that if you devalue the moment of
writing (when the poem, or the imagination, hits you over the head) then
you won't make poetry but will get stuck on the prongs of cynical critique
I outlined in previous post (maybe I almost got stuck there myself).
I think there is a context even for the imagination, and Time tempers the
poet's voice & silvers the plow.  There is a realm of actuality & what
happened is just as interesting as what's imagined. (They're almost always
intertwined). - Henry gould

Someone recently posted a reference to a new book(s) by Kevin Killian
called the Argento Series from Meow Books. A friend of mine is desperate to
own this and local (Canadian) booksellers say they can't order it. If
anyone is in the know, could they please backchannel me with direct order
specs?

With thanks,

I wanted to take this opportunity that Dodie has given me to respond to
this-- since no one else asked...

Yeah, sometimes I do feel too nice-- and although intentions have been
carefully explained/explored, tones of condescending creep in, talking
about race is always touchy and yes, posts speaking about the diversity
of one's group of friends or one's journal-- can leave me feeling, well,
yucky too.  And for just this pet-like reason-- I think that I wrote
that it feels like taxidermy -- "and this is my prized blue nosed
snarffer"-- And while it gives me stomach aches when folks talk about
race in their immediate social situations, (maybe you have something,
Kali, that it reminds one of the old "My best friends are X!"), this
sort of discussion is necessary.  And when talking about race, everyone
doesn't have to know and everyone can make mistakes! (this includes me
of course-- the other day with an Iranian American business owner-- I
was chit-chatting and found myself wanting to validate him and his
country's culture, so that he would be at ease-- and know I wasn't
racist like "them"-- and started saying something about the beauty of
the Arabic language --until he interupts stating that he speaks Persian)
Ignorance, unfortuanatly, is easy.


And to try to clear up the term "People of color" -- it may sound off to
you, Sylvester Pollet-- and yes, Joe, it is *not* like the term "colored
people"-- but it is an affirming term for people of color-- in the way
that Kali described how it is important to her friends of color to have
their ethnicity be a part of their personhood because if it isn't, it is
as if their color didn't exist or as if they had become white.

Finally, I have wondering over the weekend about the diverstiy on this
list -- I would like to connect with the lister's of color -- could you
all back channel me?  No certification required!  Seriously though, I
want to feel less alone on the list.

Not a minority,

Hoa

First of all, excuse the angry tone of my last post.  I won't bore you all
with what provoked it.

Secondly, no, Eliza, I was not accusing you of anything, and I'm sorry if I
caused you even an instant of distress.  Like Dale, I was being vaguer than
I should have been.

Thirdly, I was never questioning Joe's credentials as working class, just
asking in a rather pushy way how he felt being published as a working class
writer.  From Joe's post it seems like he does have some conflicts along
that line.  But, heh, it's hard to get published, I don't begrudge anybody
for taking anything they can get.

And the final point of my prelude--I haven't read Kali's response.  After
her performance on this list this summer I decided it best that I filter
out her messages to avoid the temptation to respond to them.

Now, to Hoa's point.  And I have a question for you Hoa, when you spoke of
the fellow at work saying they needed to diversify, I'm interested in what
exactly about him saying that bothered you.

I'm going to meander a response to the rest of Hoa's post, and we'll begin
with a story that involves Hoa herself.  When Hoa was living in San
Francisco she wrote a grant, a component of which would be a reading series
for younger writers of color--three readings in which she herself would
read with a variety of people.  She asked if Small Press Traffic would
sponsor these readings and I said sure.  Then Hoa moved to Texas and the
grant panel was stupid and didn't award Hoa the money anyway--but I
thought, why not do the reading series anyway.  So I asked another poet to
curate it--as part of our agreement I was *not* going to advertise the
series as being about writers of color.  Neither of us felt comfortable
with that.  One poet refused to read in the series because she did not want
to be singled out as a young poet of color, advertising or no.  If she was
going to read for SPT she was going to read in our regular series (she
eventually did read in the regular series).  And then the curator decided
that she didn't feel comfortable curating a series about people of color,
so I said, do what ever you want, and she opened up the series.  This
experience caused much reflection on my part, these women's refusal to be
institutionalized as women of color.  While class and race are not the same
thing in America, if I think of myself as working class (and it wasn't that
long ago since that was sexy, it hasn't been that long since feminism and
the class struggle were issues on people's agenda) and imagine a similar
institution of myself, I feel that I can approach some beginning of
understanding of their positions.

I've been reading the history of freak shows--the exoticization of
difference and displaying it to reinforce the normality of the audience.  I
can't help but see parallels here between publishing people as belonging to
a group defined as marginal, racial, class, etc., how that reinforces that
group/person's position of otherness--and the status quo of a norm, as base
of white middle classness against which this otherness is projected.

As far as who receives social compassion, groups come and go.  It's not
cool to be racist these days, but not so long ago it was.  Do I think that
a new level of humanity has been reached?  No.  Look at the scathing
condemnation of people who are overweight/ or public figures who don't look
anorexic.  I think that what should be examined is this human impulse to
define an other who reinforces the group collectivity, normality.  Thinking
of an article I read in last week's food section.  It was on packing
exciting lunches for your child.  In the article several dieticians were
asked what they packed for their own children.  On dietician said she
packed potato chips because children pay attention to what's in one
another's lunch boxes, and if her daughter had a weird lunch it would cost
her socially.  So here we have the makings of a new marginalized group,
little girls who do not carry potato chips in their lunches.  A silly
example, but a very real issue to the little girls who don't have potato
chips and are dumped on.

As far as friendships go, I don't think that someone has to speak of
somebody as
"My African American friend" in order to not deny their ethnicity.  My
first husband was Puerto Rican but I've never called him my Puerto Rican
husband--I never denied that he was Puerto Rican either.  We're still in
touch--and a few years ago he went back to Puerto Rico to live, hadn't
lived there since he was three.  So he was in town a while ago and we went
out for coffee and I asked him what it was like, living in Puerto Rico
again, expecting some glorious report of bonding with his roots, etc.  His
response:  "There's too much bureacracy there."  It's so easy to be
reductive, to pigeonhole people.

Hello, Hoa Nguyen! I understand that use of the term, I just don't like it
& don't use it myself. I am a person of color, in my estimation, a sort of
nicer color now than in March, when I tend to fade to a greyish white.
Tanner now. When people, students say, want their heritage acknowledged, I
try to honor that with sensitivity and particularity, so that I don't call
a Passamaquoddy a Micmac. It seems clear to me that many terms used
comfortably by people within a group to refer to themselves can not be used
that way by outsiders. Of course, the language is constantly shifting, &
it's our job as poets to push it into better places. I hope I'm not
sounding cantankerous here--I was a bit yesterday, after half a day
chainsawing firewood and half a day reading student papers. ( Not an
academic, just a poet/part-timer, trying to get through the winter.) I
think this sort of discussion really helps, by the way, so thanks.

Have been following this discussion with interest, and am working it
into my article on Walsh's poetry (along with that of Maurice Scully and
Geoffrey Squires).  If anyone's interested in my $.02, it will be in the
next Notre Dame Review (info at
http://www.nd.edu/~english/ndr/ndr.htm).  Can't plug that magazine
enough (and not just because they let me review books -- there'll be a
new Creeley poem in the next issue, too).

The really exciting new poetry magazine Syntactics has arrived.  As part
of the almost microscopic Atlanta poetry mafia, I'm posting an
announcement..(on behalf of editor John Lowther, who isn't net-connected
at the moment).

Issue #1 features Avelino de Araujo, Sheila Murphy, Peter Ganick, Stephen
Dignazio, Jim Leftwich, Ray DiPalma, Standard Schaefer, Matt Hill, Spencer
Selby, Fanny Howe, Pierre Joris and Joe Napora.  It comes with a broadside
which is a theoretical reflection on the pantoum and its possible
extentions by Lowther, and also a theory section with discussions by
Sheila, Jim and John of aspects of their poetics. Graphics, poetry, design
and the rest are really nice.  The issue costs $4 which I think is a steal
(#2 will be more).

John got the the issue from the printer the day before yesterday, so
copies to contributors and subscribers are going out as we (er, as I)
speak, or type.

Dodie et al -

The idea of there being a working class magazine that would be interested
in my work because of my background is intriguing to me - Would that it
were so - In fact maybe Michael Amnason's  Ottotole was that in some ways,
though of course not restricted to us working class types - And as I recall
Michael's definition required current and not just past working class
credentials - Underpaid non-profit art work being defined as hopelessly
middle class -

I was sorry to have missed the SPT reading Friday which I heard was great -
Rodrigo Toscano and Carol Lee Sanchez read here at the Poetry Center last
Thursday and were very good - the audience (mostly students) clapped wildly
after each of Rodrigo's poems -

Dodie-- thanks for the long response/illustrative anecdote to my
question about how you feel re: identity groupings.  Informative and
thought provoking.

and to your question, I wish he said that we "need to diversify".
Rather he said "We need more minorities" and the statement had
everything to do with market positioning (attracting clients) and
appearances ("we are a progressive firm: witness our "minorities").  I
take issue not only with this, (and its concomittant patronizing "tone")
but with the word "minority".  As I had signed my post, I do not
consider myself a "minority".  The word, while trying to describe the
economic-sideline status of many people of color, sounds like it is
describing population numbers, which confuses people.  (Like the white
person that told me he was a minority too because "I am a minority on
the east side bus to work")

But the trouble is, I think the above is unfair-- I mean, here the
employer was trying to acknowledge a lack of diversity-- and suggesting
a solution for it, and all I can do is feel strange and wish he would go
about it with more sensitivity and panache...

Subject:      stereotypes
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

In some contexts stereotypes serve a different function than those
mentioned heretofore. I'm a bit hesitant to bring this up, not because I
may be seen as throwing fat on the fire, but because I'm not sure how well
it fits into this discussion. But here goes.

I'm a New Yorker. Some years ago I bought a house in a working class
neighborhood in Brooklyn. Ethnicity there was a matter of strata. The
bedrock level was Irish Catholic, overlain by Italian Catholic and various
Slavic and Baltic types, all (except the Irish) no more than two
generations from Ellis Island. On top of this were more recent strata from
Puerto Rico, some Blacks (give me a better word) and a very few jews
(Jews--mostly recent Russian immigrants--lived in large numbers in the next
neighborhood, and Hasids beyond them). I was the only jew and the only
college-educated middle class type on my block. The different ethnic
identities remained intact, although we all lived interspersed among each
other. It was only in the teenage group that inter-group dating and
marriage had begun, but these didn't seem to create many problems.

I detected no particular group animosities, and I've got a pretty good
sniffer for these things, but there was a lot of casual stereotyping, often
voiced between neighbors, which seemed to function as a set of
hypotheses--"I can expect certain behaviors from x because jews (italians,
blacks, etc.) are like that. Oh, he didn't conform to expectations? That's
interesting"--on the way to greater intimacy. I'm not suggesting that as
the stereotyping towards this or that person softened the sense of
difference disappeared--that was always there--we remained, across the
differences, exotic to each other, but not dangerous. There were, in fact,
real cultural differences. The stereotyping, in fact, helped to keep the
peace in this most peaceful neighborhood--it was a way of telling oneself
not to be offended by this or that behavior. It was so important that if
someone's ethnicity was not immediately apparent one would be asked
directly, as I was by the stoop-sitters who monitored the street.

I realized that I had been doing this all my life. Growing up in polyglot
and polyethnic New York I had depended on ethnic markers as navigational
buoys. Interestingly, my wife, raised in Asheville, N.C., will miss the
most obvious markers of difference between white folks--at home there were
only three groups, black, and, distinguishable, at the very least, by
accent, hillbilly and other white. Absent the distinction of accent all
white folks tend to be, for her, the same, and I see her bumping up against
ethnic differences that didn't exist in her environment all the time. She's
probably, by the way, the least racist, least bigoted person I have ever
known, but a few stereotypes would really make her life easier.

i find this type of thing fascinating.  i am often (as you must be kali)
asked about my ethnicity, i think because of the combination of my name
(which could be number of different things), the kind of work i do and the
fact that i look (and am, according to current definitions) white.  being
jewish though makes for an interesting twist in the cloth.  it's hard to
convey to West coasters and midwesterners the reality that in my hometown
(boston and environs) it was standard during my childhood and adolescence
(and possibly even now) for certain country clubs etc to officially exclude
blacks and jews. when explaining why that meant i didn't belong to the
institutions that my classmates did, i've been stopped and asked, "you look
pretty white to me, so what's the problem?"  as if they hadn't heard, or
couldn't process, the "and jews" part of what i'd said. it just isn't part
of how they divide up the world.  the christian majority is not just a
majority, it is the only reality (in fact i just learned that the Minnesota
Humanities Commission will not fund events that happen on Sunday mornings
which i think borders on the unconstitutional).  and then jews (and
nonjews) want to know what i'm doing w/ a name like maria.  iv'e been
fascinated and amused by inter-ethnic joshing among people for whom it's
also a very charged issue.  a former boyfriend, who is ethiopian, doesn't
hesitate to characterize people by their ethnicity (Amharas have good
cuisine, Gurages are small-time hustlers, etc).  in ethiopia, much blood
has been shed over which ethnic group is in power, and yet it seems that,
as you say, mark, there's also a level at which ethnic teasing can have a
benign innoculative effect. i was shocked but also amused the first time he
teasingly called me a "sickly little yid."  it was impossible to be
offended; the shock was because no american i knew would ever ever say
anything like that, even in jest, and in fact, when an american christian
friend did try to tease me once about jews and money, i got very upset; i
didn't realize she was just teasing. (i'm specifying ethnicity and religion
here not to show off that i have an  american christian friend, but to
demonstrate how the fact of her american christianity affected how i heard
her). (i'm also not trying to usurp a discussion about people of color by
piping up with a disingenuous jewish me-tooism; rather wanting to talk,
like mark, about the different ways these work contextually)
i've also heard Native Americans from different tribes/nations tease each
other, and there are some deep-seated historical tensions between some of
the teasers that i've heard.  i live in pc land here (the affirmative
action commissioner, or something like that, of st paul, was forced to step
down a few years ago because there were some ethnic jokes told at a banquet
he presided over) so i try to learn and not get too caught up in public
controversy (though i did risk my job once by playing lenny bruce's "how to
relax your colored friends at parties" in a class on "minority" literature;
the subject is so charged that any irony was lost on my students; i'll
never do that again).

I guess it's because I'm a straight white guy, but I've always suspected
that the tension put _on the left_ about race and sex has been a divide and
conquer strategy _by the right_ to divert attention from the real issue
which is always money and power -- as long as money and power are God, or
whatever god-position-substitute we're flavoring our breakfast with now.
Who cares how we talk to eachother about these things? Are we doing so well
we can afford to ignore the baiters? and what they're taking from our
pockets as we're arguing?

hoa, i understand your hesitance.  i've had similar reactions to
mucky-mucks going on about diversity.  as i'm sure most of us have, i've
seen an awful lot of these statements around our various institutions, i
always get the feeling that the push comes from an interest in being
diversified for the sake of gaining points politically, rather than a
genuine desire to see any other perspectives (a particular perspective or
just others in general) find a place within an institution.  and i always
read 'diversify' in that context as meaning "we need to hire more people
that don't look like me and the white board of directors, but are eager to
say the same things we've always said".

there seems to be a real tendency here to conflate the "managing diversity"
types, recognizable to all who inhabit large bureaucratic structures, with
those who would ask deeply critical questions about the ways that we speak
of race and ethnicity -- a _lot_ of work has been done in this area which
might shed some much needed light --

since we're exchanging biblios, here are some worth inspecting:

Multiculturalism: A Critical Reader, ed. David Theo Goldberg

Race Consciousness, ed. Judith Fossett and Jeffrey Tucker

Comparative American Identities, ed. Hortense Spiller

The Bounds of Race, ed. Dominick LaCapra

Racial Formations/Critical Transformations, E. San Juan Jr.

Race, Nation, Class, Balibar and Wallerstein

Manifest Manners, Gerald Vizenor


there are many more, natch.,,,, but these contain some particularly
fruitful debates --

now, if you really want to see some right wing divide and conquer -- try
the Threnstroms"  (sp?) new book

i haunt around occassionally on a couple of bbs's, with the username Jose
Jimenez, no one told me that i'd need a handle the first time i logged on,
i lifted the name from the comedian's routine (it was reflex, thinking for
a different name never occurred to me).

it seems that most of my contemporaries are far too young to remember the
comedian (in fact, i only know about him from the space movie "the right
stuff", so i spose i should say  that they're too young to remember "the
right stuff").  during most sessions people will send messages in spanish,
then get offended when i try in my best, hacked spanish (two semesters in
high school i try to explain) that i don't speak their language.  another
lot will ask what nationality i am, and get pissed when i say "american".
my mother's ancestors came from norway about 150 years ago, my father's
from the british isles 100 or so (so you can see that i'm white as hell,
saying i'm "american" means something much different to people with
different ancestry).

i had one hell of a point when i started.  forigive me, my blood sugar's
getting low.  i'll let you all find the particular relevance

best,

for those of you that wonder, my mother spells my name 'eric', unless she's
patronizing me.

Here's a story about that. A black friend from NY was visiting me when I
lived in Tucson. It was Martin Luther King day, and this was a few years
ago, when Arizona was the last holdout against instituting the holiday. As
both Kali and Maria point out, race remains a topic even between close
friends of different colors, whether in the form or teasing, challenge,
curiosity, or passing interest. My friend asked how come Arizona was so
backwards. I acknowledged that there is a fair amount of racism in Arizona
(is the Pope Polish?), but I thought that another factor might be that
Arizona is (was then, at least) only two percent black, which meant that
there was less pressure for the holiday than in other places. So he asked
why there wasn't a day consecrated to a native american, say Geronimo. What
an idea. I don't think he knew any native americans, but I should have
known better.
I ran the idea past a Navajo friend, who waxed linguistically colorful for
a few minutes. To summarize: "We hate Geronimo. We hate Apaches. They're
all horsethieves and murderers, and they don't bathe enough."
What if, I suggested, we picked someone from a tribe that doesn't exist in
Arizona? Did my friend think a Hiawatha day would fly?
He wasn't as amused as I was.
Arizona, by the way, has since joined the rest of us in celebrating Martin
Luther King Day.

     A quick note linking Robert Drake's rhetorical question (... why start
     another mag that duplicates existing?), kali tal's  post "... if I
     can't talk about poetry in terms of love ... I figure why talk about
     it at all" and joe amato's response "I would only add that the love of
     justice has something to do with all of this." I agree with you
     Robert, to consider establishing a magazine duplicating another seems
     little more than replication of style and formula. Nothing wrong with
     that, but there can be so much more.

     Once a publishing endeavour / magazine effectively becomes an
     extension of yourself,  opens up avenues of personal expression and
     development, allows you to give voice to what moves you, fuels the
     capacity to be more imaginatively responsive, more functionally human
     - it becomes far removed from replication.

     For instance (and perhaps I misinterpret joe's words "love of
     justice"), a small press publisher is in a position to encourage
     public comment on a range of topics / issues. My point though is that
     there's nothing too intuitive about "taking up issues" for the sake of
     it (doesn't that ... uh oh ... lead to the stultifying / conforming
     aspects of political correctness?), and there's nothing too intuitive
     about taking on writing from people / groups / perspectives outside
     your experience simply because it's pc to do so ... seems to me like a
     skin graft, part of you but ... is it really? And it's not the
     emotions attendant in exercising power that are interesting, what's
     intuitive about that? But if there's enough space and freedom within
     the publishing activity to allow you to be moved by the ... culturally
     diverse? ... or where a (subjective) sense of justice is brought into
     play ... then, integrity ... remains.

     Hopefully....

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

In the midst of this lates discussion, a new book has been born.

Maggie Jaffe, _How The West Was One_, with art by Deborah Small.  96pp,
perfectbound, 5.5" x 8.5", 4-color cover, lots of beautiful illustrations
in the text. $12, plus $1.50 shipping and handling.  ISBN 1-885215-19-3.
Order from Viet Nam Generation, Inc., PO Box 13746, Tucson, AZ 85732-3746.

"_How The West Was One_ lifts the veil of history and reveals the
corruption, greed, and arrogance that hide behind noble-sounding
phrases:  Westward Expansion, Manifest Destiny, the Monroe Doctrine,
the Good Neighbor Policy, and the New World Order.  Maggie Jaffe's
poignant poetry transcends propaganda and didacticism and shows the
impossibility of separating the political from the personal."
     --Jon Forrest Glade, _Photographs of the Jungle_

"In _How The West Was One_, Maggie Jaffe, one of the most clear-voiced,
clear-sighted poets of our time, exposes the truth behind the media
presentations which shape young minds into the bog of uncritical,
unemotional, cultural and racially supremacist thinking. This book
should be in motel rooms, instead of Gideons Bible, to help citizens
see the tangled web they helped to weave."
     --Belinda Subraman, _The Gulf War: Many Perspectives_


Here's a selection from _How the West Was One_.  Unfortunately, the
email medium doesn't allow me to reproduce the typography or artwork:


Imperial Breadfruit

Though imported from the
South Seas to the West Indies
as "cheap food for slaves,"
_Joy of Cooking_ describes
breadfruit as "the most
beautiful of tropical trees,
with a highly romantic history."

"Why it's breadfruit,"
said the Bounty's Captain Bligh
to Fletcher Christian
while circumnavigating the globe,
"for the greater glory of us all."
Christian and Company
preferred women to glory:
their breasts like breadfruit.

The Bounty brought the Pox
& mirrors to Tahiti:
perhaps the locus for
_Joy's_ "romanticisism."
When they mutinied
[floggings, thirst, rancid meat]
"unruly" crews threw
the "sacred saplings" overboard,
even if breadfruit prevented scurvy.

Years later, Darwin collected
breadfruit from Tahiti
when the Beagle
"touched" its shores.
Though _Origin of the Species_
seemed to justify it,
after Brazil he would write:
"Thank God I shall never
again visit a slave country."

While Darwin became a bestseller
Melville's critique of Empire
didn't make him a crowd pleaser.
Known as "the man who lived with cannibals"
for the rest of his literary life.

In _Typee, Or a Peep at Polynesian Life_
he lists exotic breadfruit recipes--
none of them appear in _Joy_:

    Kokoo (k'aku): roasted breadfruit
    pounded & mixed with coconut milk.

    Amar (ma): a tart cake baked
    from fermented breadfruit.

    Poee-poee (popoi): a pudding
    made by adding water to the former.

Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis)
has dark-green, irregular
leaves with globe-like
"seductive-tasting fruit,"
roasted or steamed with butter,
salt & pepper.
Because it's fart-producing,
ginger tea taken with breadfruit's
the best remedy.

To guard against devil hunger
breadfruit's planted
for each new-born Tahitian.

If an immature tree's cut
down, it's equivalent to murder.

In the West Indies
breadfruit was believed to cure
Drapetomania:
"a disease known by
a slave's excessive love of freedom,"
whose symptoms were
feigning sicknes, slowing down,
running off, axing Massa
in his alabaster chamber.

So why don't you provoke something that helps instead of implying that
references coined by particular groups other than your own make you
uncomfortable?

Subject:      Social Tangles
Content-Type: text/plain

There are two elements in these discussions I provoked.  One is the need
to represent diversity through poetic channels.  Another is to satisfy
one’s own demands, whatever they be, for formal poetic experimentation.
These are elements I engage myself with also.  My own idealistic
dementia desires greater personal freedom for people of all backgrounds,
whatever they be.  This is a social concern that I am sympathetic to,
due to personal experiences, state of mind, and because I prefer greater
freedom over its opposite and wish to do unto others as they do unto me,
etc.  My other concern, however, is artistic, aesthetic.  And that
aesthetic is not socially based.  My understanding of art has been
influenced, for better or worse, by the amazingly compact but lucid
contributions to this subject by Theodor Adorno.  Others, many others,
both living and dead, have influenced my thought as well.  But Adorno
addresses art with a compact clarity I appreciate.  Anyway, for me, this
kind of influence represents what I think of as a social exchange.  And
these exchanges happen all the time.  They even happen on this list.
Discussions of race, gender, sexual preference -- all of this and much
more, including the overt power structures of economy under which we all
live -- this is all socially necessary to argue, discuss, and debate.

What I disagree with is the now accepted fact that art can contain, or
represent in some way, the same sense of social urgency as a
conversation, say, or discussions like those on this list.  Art’s power
is not in what it addresses, but in what it is capable of reflecting.
Its power is mimetically traced to something in nature, something in us
as human beings.  I don’t mean nature as birds and bees either.  I mean
deeper elements of predation, hunger, desire, and * thought*, which is
actually the body’s tool.  What I sense as false in poetry is often only
an over statement of social urgency, expressed in terms that deny the
very being from which such formal gestures originate.  Often, poetry
represses the humorous, self-conscious impulse from which we articulate
our social desires.  At times, ‘experiemental’ forms, the ones, perhaps
Kevin publishes in Mirage, though he doesn’t necessarily like them,
appear inhuman to me because they repel any human sympathy I might be
capable of lending the poem.  I often always agree with the social cause
inherent in such poems.  But the inhumane disregard for the reader
strikes me as an ingenuine gesture on the poet’s part.  Because, as the
poet strives to communicate social injustice, he or she alienates those
who might otherwise support it.  I realize humanism itself is suspect of
foul play, and many have provided useful critiques regarding its values.
So perhaps this is where my differences lie.  Without being a
philosopher, I don’t know.  I became a poet so that I would not have to
make linear sense.  I wanted to invigorate and create.  Out of a sense
of self-defense, however, today I will attempt to balance my more
playful impulses.

Smart, socially active poetry is often void of emotional cohesion, or
even conflict.  The lyric, as it was practiced in this language for
centuries, has been replaced with the sentimental suburban barbecue
flavors of that bland, relatively unengaged work of poets in the
University journals, the New Yorker and Poetry.  I’m really not
attentive to that poetry in a way that qualifies me to speak of it at
greater depth, so I won’t push it.  But to me, it’s rather, excuse the
term, *useless* as a means of expanding my own sense of poetics.
Another group that is more or less consistent in terms of form would be
what I assume many of us practice, though I don’t presume all of us.  It
has been influenced by a variety of well-meaning and compelling formal
methods and theories.  Many, but not all, Language Poets have careers of
some kind in academia and their influence has spread to new generations
of writers, such as my own.  I will be reductive and say that their
concerns are, as I once heard Harriet Mullin say, with the trinity of
Class, Consciousness and Society.  Many small journals and books publish
poetry that, to my mind, adheres to this social trinity in terms of
content.  Its formal methodology is as diverse as the poets who practice
this kind of poetics.  But I would say that writers engaged in this
activity do share certain elements in common.  At the expense of
sounding like Mark Wallace, I’ll enumerate.

1)  This Language-influenced poetry lacks a unified subject of
expression, ie, the poem’s voice is fragmented, or composed of many
voices.  It is paratactic and employed as a formal element.  I suppose
this is due to some mimetic sense of same disunity in the culture at
large, and is potentially a valid expression of such.

2)  It is very smart and ironic, but it lacks a greater sense of humor
and a more subtle intelligence.

3)  It is conscious of limits but doesn’t know when to end a poem

4)  It distributes a wide range of images throughout a poem, but without
an apparent purpose.  It is unable to form recognizable patterns and
therefore confuses, increases the human distance of which I spoke
earlier, and takes the power of interpretation away from the reader by
not giving said reader a leg to stand on.

5)  It is highly moral, in a tradition that would be in league with
Jonathan Edwards if Edwards had known less about good prosody and
efficient diction.

6)  It treats language as substance, without the necessary human
conviction behind anything but the gesture of the experiment.

In addition, a big problem with this type of aesthetic practice is that
it is generally accepted by many that one does not have to like a poem
to want to print it, read it, or do anything other than make paper
airplanes out of it.  The social content is well liked, but the poems
themselves usually fall flat.

I don’t see how any of the above benefits social causes in any way.
Whereas, lyric poetry, by recognizing suffering, employing language to
heighten sensitivity or sympathy, and appealing to the humane impulses
of the reader was able to address similar social issues.  But it
contained the added depth of emotional suffering or joy, pleasure or
pointed barbs aimed to provoke bourgeois pain.  An aesthetics charged
with the conviction of the self to confront social pressures invigorates
and opens readers to the concerns the poet, who is really a cultural
antennae, is conscious of and lives with in an awakened state of life.
There are many poets writing today who fulfill my demands.  There are
many who don’t.  Unlike Hoa, I believe strongly in sides, because they
will be drawn for you, or over you, unless you yourself take one and
follow it to the bitter end.  I don’t mean to imply, however, that once
you’ve been awakened to your own foolishness of pursuit it is impossible
to switch sides.  But you should be conscious of where you are standing,
however uncomfortable that place may be.

I guess all I meant by this long-winded diatribe was that sometimes
social issues cannot be represented by poetry but they can emanate from
poems.  Sometimes good poetry has nothing to do with social subjects but
society is affected by what a poem offers.  This bickering over who you
use to represent your magazine is necessary.  But it is also equally
necessary to know what your magazines do to reflect a diversity of
worlds both malignant and benign.  Inspire or incite, but don’t allow
complacency to infect.  And judging by what I see, and by my own small
habits of life, that is easy to do.

Dale

good point jordan, but it's still useful to hash things out; it's not
always divide and conquer, sometimes it's (used to be) called

It occurred to me, while secretly plotting the overthrow of the San Diego
Mass Transit System (it's important to start small), that we're likely to
know what a Molotov Cocktail is long after the Soviet Union, or for that
matter the man himself, has been forgotten. A peculiar kind of immortality,
for short time, anyway. I wonder what other instruments of destruction
memorialize once-living humans. Who were Sten and Gattling?
Any other items for this list?

Well, Henry Shrapnel (1761-1842) comes to mind: the British artillery
officer who pushed ballistics beyond club & concussion. And the Immelman
turn in dogfighting [perhaps a vanishing mode of warfare], after its
inventor, Max Immelman (1890-1916). More?

Richard Jordan Gatling, 1818-1903.  Mainly an agricultural inventor, known
for inventing a handcranked precursor to the machine gun.  Offered it to
the Union army, but they didn't take him up until 1866, after the war.

Sten was actually two people and one country: _S_heppard and _T_urpin and
_En_gland.

I find this discussion remarkable and think, only in America.  I live in a
country where the thousand shades of skin all have names.  Where the opening
conversation between strangers is a frank exploration of social origins and
status.  Where people speak a different LANGUAGE depending upon with whom
they are speaking: royalty, high ranking bureaucrats and socialites,
teachers, peers, employees and servants. I won't even broach the issues of
foreign daughters-in-law.

The privileged Thai living in the United States must have had the shock of
their life when they discovered that they were people of color.  Perhaps the
American melting pot is distilling a global method living with equality and
justice for all; we certainly can use some boiling over here.  Hey, I'm
raising three children in this mess.

I just want to say that you've come a long way and you're not back at square
one because someone wants to be or is IDENTIFIED.  Also, I'd like to
highlight the benefits of an attitude of moderation, it is helpful when
discussion is in danger of becoming conflict. Moderation is an expression of
caring, particularly appropriate to this group of passionate and caring
people.

Gee, I love this stuff.  These refs can be found in _War Slang_,
by Paul Dickson.

Garand: M1 rifle, named after John Garand. (WWII)
General Grant: army tank (WWII)
General Lee: army tank (WWII)
Jack Johnson: a big shell, usually the German 17" (WWI)
Sam Browne: military belt named after Gen. Sir Samuel Joseph Browne (WWI)
Sherman necktie:  named after Gen. Sherman; twisted iron rail used to
    disable Southern railroads in the Civil War

In the Immelman category, see:

Balbo: enormous flight formation named after Italian general Italo Balbo--
    the one in the last scene of lots of WWII flicks
Lufberry circle and Lufberry show, maneuvers attributed to American ace
    Raoul Lufberry (WWI)

Weapons named after women:

Aunt Jemima:  explosive mixed with flour (WWII)
Betsy the Sniper:  nickname for 155mm American cannon (WWI)
Big Bertha: German siege gun (WWI), named after Bertha Antoinette Krupp
   (yes, of *those* Krupps) von Bohlen und Halbach.  The guns fired
    "Bertha pills." Bertha also came in "little" form, as a "105".
black Maria: high explosive shell allegedly named after an African
    American boarding house owner in Boston (WWI)
bouncing Betty: the everpopular antipersonnel mine (Vietnam)
coughing Clara: heavy artillery gun (WWII)
Dolly Parton: version of Soviet T-72 tank used by Iraqis.  Had a rounded
     turret that reminded soldiers of the singer... (Gulf War)
hissing Jenny: large shell (WWI)
Maggie: magnetic mine (WWII)
peewee Matilda: small tank (WWII)
Rosalie: slang for bayonet (WWI)

Howitzers came in "grandma" and "mother" sizes (WWI)

There's something very compelling and immediate about military slang.
It's often stripped directly from pop culture.  John Wayne was the
operational verb for heroic stupidity in the Viet Nam war; it shifted
to Rambo in the Gulf.  Some soldiers in VN called the country (and the
war) The Brown Disneyland or Six Flags Over Nothing.  Soldiers in the
Gulf (especially the navy) started calling it Wallyworld.  The multi-
level analysis implicit in claiming that a soldier missing-in-action
has "gone Elvis" is hard to match, equalled only by that astonishing
new term to describe the media war: Schwarzkrieg.

The world's not likely to forget Kalashnikov's (sp?) name any time soon.
There was an article in the Chicago Tribune recently abt him --  how he
was never recompensed for his invention by the soviets.  Patents don't
carry much weight in non capitalist societies.

... huh?  whoa mike/dales....  a) why is it you assume one is obligated to
provoke?  that provoking turns up helpful things?  on this list, "provoking,"
especially deliberate provoking, has been turning up a lot of discomfort and
defensiveness that more often than not have clouded issues, so if it is up to
me, i'd just as soon someone not take out their virtual acetylene torch and
try and "provoke" up a storm; b) since when is the only constructive way to
work out various thoughts to "provoke" anyway?  what happened to discuss, tease
out opposing realities, dissect into multiple facets and look for prevalance,
ask for new ways to solve for x, etc?  c) doesn't seem to me that there
was anything about saying references coined by other groups than speaker's
own make speaker uncomfortable.  what was said was, and rightfully so, that
inside of a group referents may be used which are offensive when used by one
outside of group.  two examples spring to mind - i've heard various black
people use the word "nigger" in reference to self/each other, i.e. "i am one
bad nigger" but for non-black person to use word would be grossly offensive;
as woman, i might often jokingly refer to "the girls" as sort of warm and
age-inclusive and self-teasing referent, or as sly referent to gay component,
as in "she's cute -- think she's one of us girls?".  but when a male refers
to women as girls, well, i'm not through the ceiling about it most of the
time but it can be kind of offensive.  THAT is what post was about, not
as you imply some effort to impose referents coined only by speaker's group,
whatever you parse that to be.

finally, i see no opposition between looking for interesting responses and
pointing out one interesting facet -- post was in fact another interesting
facet on original thread -- insider/outsider viewpoint added to efforts to
diversify added to racial/gender mix of mags.

maybe since poster put some effort into posting, might be better to respect
poster's own words and not try and spin them into something else, eh?

Dear List,
        Here is the wonderful piece Hannah Weiner wrote for her  Tender
Buttons book, silent teachers   remembered sequel, published  in 1994, in
honor of her 65th birthday (November 4th)...The book is available through
me or through Small Press Distribution: 1 (800) 869-7553.

HANNAH WEINER       SILENT TEACHER

hannah weiner was born to it in providence ri in 1928 and graduated
from radcliffe college 1950 magna cum laude    she then worked for
three publishing houses   got fired from all of them    once for being
too intellectual    once for associating with aliens and once for
being caught not slapping her bosses face      she then turned to
retailing and was an assistant buyer for fat ladies dresses in
bloomingdales basement     she married a psychiatrist   freudian
and divorced him four years later     then she exaggerated but not lied
herself into a job designing lingerie and turned down her second
request for marriage     by this time she was making the rounds of
galleries and parties in the early sixties and began to write
poetry in 1963    both writing and designing were childhood ambitions
she got a free course at the new school and found she couldnt write
new york school poetry in fact she couldnt write her own words
at all    only the magritte poems      written in     and the fast are in
her own words     happily she discovered the international code of
signals and found she could write about almost anything
by using the code books     these became rather wild performances
followed by other performances like street works 1-7 and the
fashion show poetry event    she was very well reviewed because
the art critic of the village voice was one of her partners
she thus met the musicians   performers   pop artisits   lesbians
and poets of that time
all this glory ended in 1970 when she became extremely psychic
and hiding out in a cheap apartment wrote about nothing else in
almost 100 notebooks     see the fast     the words began to appear
in 1972 and led to the clairvoyant journal a three voice
performance poetry book about learning     explaining instructions
and the counter voice     years passed     the language group moved in
and so did the indians    she still remembers meeting chawho
at a party saying youre getting pretty old dont you think you
should publish    she did   sixteen and spoke begin to introduce
the teaching   now she is reaching her ultimate achievement
learned first at her grandmother's knee      TEACHING SILENT
she has dragged several poets into this with her    gosh ma shes a
real female tarpsichordist

I'm currently a student at Naropa's writing program which has had it's own
somewhat pathetic and not-so pathetic struggles and forrays into the issue of
diversification.  Being the only out and politically identified lesbian here
has been a lesson in aloneness but no one ever said it'd be different.  In my
application I wrote that I understood that coming from a radical lesbian
feminist tradition to the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics to be an
act of crossover.  But I am interested in these acts, how someone who is
so informed by (my) social positioning reconciles aestetic choices and
community.  Well, the erotic poetry lesbians were never going to publish me
anyway.

Anyway here's an interesting anecdote and you'll excuse all my labeling which
I'll call flavoring for the interest of the story and the list thread.
Josepha Conrad (an Austrian/German immigrant) and I (what did Jane Bowles use
to call herself? crippy dyke kike?--I'm not crippy yet) organized a group
independent study of the work and life of Gertrude Stein as there had been
and were to be no intensives of women in the entire two years+ (though yes
Blake, Pound, Joyce) that we would be students here (and because we were
interested).  There are two others in the group--interestingly enough, a
young gay native american man, and a south asian woman, but who's looking.
Last week we were considering our week's reading and came upon "Melanctha,"
the second portrait of _Three Lives_.  A few of us had read a bit of it
and/or heard other things of Stein's somewhat off views on american blacks
and were surprised to read Richard Wright's comments on Melanctha "The style
was so insitent and original and sang so quaintly that I took the book home.
As I read it my ears were opened for the first time to the magic of the
spoken word .  I began to hear the speech of my grandmother, who spoke a
deep, pure Negro dialect and with whom I had lived for many years."
        Ish thought Wright must have been blackmailed or something and the
rest of us went about defending it all.  Yet since the class and having read
the piece, I am a bit confounded.  Stein's stereotyping and blatent
prejudices "Rose Johnson was a real black, tall, well built, sullen, stupid,
childlike, good looking negress" seem to be a mix of her usual subverting and
some truly skewed and limited observations.
        Do listlings have more information about it?  Is there anywhere where
Stein herself describes what she is trying to do in Melanctha?  Critiques?
Controversies over Wright's support?

best,

Rachel Levitsky

i appreciate this thorough, thoughtful post.  i'm not sure i'm all the way
with adorno here, much as i admire him.  he also was writing in a context
of lyric being just about dead in germany, in a woeful state indeed; and
also much "content-based" poetry/art was associated either with stalinism
or with fascism, which had set itself against the "decadent, jewish"
modernism.  the context here is different.

Gertrude Stein lived a long time and wrote many different works that each
were the works that the time the works were written were the person that
she was for that part of the time.  When she wrote Melanctha did she know
she was gay or did she know she was herself.  She might have thought she
was a scientist like William James was a scientist who explored and
thought instead of experimented.  Was she already free of her brother or
was she still not trapped by her brother.  Before the flowers of
friendship faded friendship faded, is that a different person from Mrs
Reynolds on one side or Wars I Have Known on another side.  Gertrude
Stein must have had something to do with Alfred North Whitehead besides
being one of the three geniuses genii I should say the third side of the
triangle was Picasso if I am remembering and I am remembering I think it
was as it was.  To say stop I only carried my father this far is to no
longer worry about identity except as a problem.  What Whitehead said was
that I know where I am when I am lost but not where the other places
are.  Transfer this to identity and what is it it is that I know who I am
but not who the others are.  This is separate from transformation that is
the being a little boy and then being a man.  Is it the same as being I
because of a little dog?  I think it is very suitable.  Was it
satisfactory it was satisfactory.  It was thinking as thought was going
into itself without being what some other angle would see the thought
being.  Everybody understood who listened but the patient ones were not
all of them.  Does your little dog know you are a person of color?

On Wright and Stein and "Rose Johnson was a real black, tall, well
built, sullen, stupid, childlike, good looking negress."  This would
probably not have disturbed Wright much, at least if "Long Black Song"
is any indication of Wright's attitude toward black women.  The
description of Rose seems almost like a model for the Sarah whom Wright
creates in his story--I suspect that Rose is such a model and Stein an
influence on Wright's style in "Long Black Song"--someone on the list
might know that more certainly than I do.  I don't think Sarah even gets
a name until almost half way through the story--she's just "She."
Stein's depiction of Rose may have been one of the things that attracted
Wright, not something to which he would have objected.

Dear Rachel, if I were you I would try to get a copy of Aldon Nielsen's
book "Reading Race" . . .  a marvelous book which includes a chapter, or I
guess part of a chapter, on just this controversy.  He explores the
historical background behind various black writers' endorsement of
"Melanctha" (and other works by Gertrude Stein) and he can hardly write a
sentence which isn't interesting all by itself.  Beyond Stein he goes
through the whole catalogue of US modernists and shows, one by one, how
every one of them (OK a few exceptions) lets us down, or lets themselves
down, on racial issues.  Some amazing surprising stuff there.  If you
cannot find it at Naropa library or local library or bookstore let me know
I will send you section on "Melanctha."  Nielsen is actually on the Poetics
list and if he were a gentleman, and not such a shrinking violet, he would
send you the address of the publisher, thus increasing his readership base,
possibly his royalties too, tho' that's far fetched.  In any case I know
you, Rachel, will thoroughly enjoy this book.

Rachel:

Coincidentally, a reading group i participate in just finished discussing
Stein's _Three Lives_ and had similar questions about her point-of-view
assumptions in *Melanctha*.  The Richard Wright quote--do you know what it
comes from? where i'd find it? Is there more to it?

Thanks for the contextual note Maria.  The particular book of Adorno’s I
return to again and again, especially when under fire from the SPT
Thought Police, is *Aesthetic Theory,* written, as I’m sure you know,
late in the ‘60’s before just before his death.  Many of the issues
Adorno addresses are, I believe, culturally relevant.  He lived, after
all, for many years in this country, and was responding to changing
pressures of an increasingly, as he saw it, administered society both
here and in western Europe.  His critique is often aimed at the middle
ground, between fascists and marxists both, in an attempt to confront
the culture that grew out of the great destruction of WWII.  That
culture he responded to is also similar to our own in terms of
comodification, administration of culture and art, and the continued
limitation of the individual as a vehicle for expression in the face of
opposition.  So, I guess I must argue that Adorno’s aesthetic context is
similar to our own in more ways than, perhaps, you would allow.  Not to
deny the other influences you mentioned.  Because I’m sure those were
very real pressures.  But I think, especially in the later work, he is
responding to issues very similar to what we face today.

Dale this is a thoroughly unnecessary comment, a dehumanization of myself,
and a slam on an institution that is working very hard to keep voices such
as yours alive in in the Bay Area.  Small Press Traffic has done nothing to
you but to support you as a writer.  To reduce me to an institution is
appallingly bad manners, at best.

=46irst of all, I, Dodie, am the co-editor of Mirage.  Secondly, neither
Kevin nor I have ever published work we didn't like.  There's lots of
different reasons to like a work--a spirit of fun, a zest, good sex,
political upheaval, undefinable moments of beauty, as well as formal
innovation.  Mirage is committed to experimental forms--it just has a broad
definition of "experimental."

Ultimately, Dodie, what you sense as bad manners on my part is only my
unwillingness to post the usual dull, obvious, and self-serving posts
that frequent this list.  You are against thought, as far as I can see,
by reducing it, continually, to a high-minded form of self-righteousness
and *manners.*  The thing you don't get, is that we can have differing
opinions without it being a bad form of etiquette.

Ultimately, I think you respond out of fear and self defensiveness.  I
think what you dislike in my posts is that what you read begins to turn
the rusty gears of pressure in your head, and that scares you.  So, to
stop that fear you challenge with problems of diversity or anything else
that is convenient.  You are not consistent with your charges on this
list, and I am not the only one whom you continually slander.  I mean,
you do a pretty good job of covering your ass.  But we can read between
the lines.

And I will speak my mind. If I am unfair, or out of line, and it's
pointed out to me, I usually acknowledge it. And, as far as policing
goes, my statement is completely accurate in terms of my experience with
you on this list.

It was wrong of me, in the context of my post the other day, to ask you
for grace, of any kind.  But, maybe it's a vestige of my bourgeious
background. I find that grace gives others the opportunity to delay
personal conflict.  I lack this often myself.  But much of what we say,
as poets, is charged with the moment of articulation, and is
unavoidable.  This medium itself distorts us, pushes us to appear a bit
more binomial that we would be in each other's presence.  I think that
tolerance of ideas is necessary.  No doubt I sometimes come on strong,
and will continue to do so.  And you can have all kinds of problems with
that.  But I think it would benefit discussion on this list if arguments
were based less on personal biases and founded more upon intelligent
opposition or counter positions to those we disagree with.

Yours, a little winded,
Dale

Well, Kevin, on Friday, asked why you only had to publish what you like?
I think he then went on to say that he publishes things he doesn't like
quite often.  Not wanting to speak for you, co-editor of Mirage, Dodie
Bellamy, I refrained from associating you with that editorial practice
because I had the feeling you publish based on what you convey below.  I
also was reluctant to mention your name because it usually brings
nothing but grief these days.  Apologies.  I should have been less
Kevin-centric.

I would have responded to Mr. Pollet-- front channel-- but he also sent
me a message saying basically the same thing back channel so I responded
there.

I am suprised no one else questioned what I thought was a rather
provacative statement on Mr. Pollet's part.  In my last communication
with him, I suggested that maybe we take up this thread front channel
and I am still uncertain whether there is general interest...

You're right, Dale, your brand of dehumanization does, indeed, frighten me.
I can only respond to it in horror.

Thanks all for your great responses to the Stein question, the Nielson
book sounds good,  I'll check and get back whether I can find it.  But
to a more pressing matter.

Hoa--

I'm found the post rather confusing because Mr. Pollet did not say what
his identity actually was.  I didn't assume he was white, didn't assume
he'd be that silly and mean.  It sort of reminds me of a conversation
about diversity in which everyone whines that there is too much labeling
happening, too much naming--assuming that naming things is simplifying
rather than complexifying.  Who said so?  Just like Stein was always
changing, as reflected in Schuchat Simon's post, so are the names and
their meanings.  We are constantly exploring what our very own names
mean.  What does being Rachel Levitsky mean anyway?  Creeley said this
summer that our names are not our own.  And yet they are useful.  I have
a new word for labeling.   Poetry.

dale
i am not sure what your issue with dodie is, but i wonder, could you keep
it backchannel?

just for record, if someone came to me and said "Quick!  describe dodie
bellamy!"
> " against thought, as far as I can see,
by reducing it, continually, to a high-minded form of self-righteousness
and *manners.*"
would absolutely not be what comes to mind.

able to penetrate in a single glance, quite often, to the painful and because
painful, not spoken; fiery; brave; sometimes hasty; often seen backing down if
haste and fire has brought her too far; gentle; busy; tired; overcommitted;
multiply viewed; wise, in that older-woman wise way; freely moving between
age groups; learned; able to command small details in a single bound; a fine
champion of women, working class, non-academics, writers, editors, literati,
all color/ethnicity/religion; quick to understand subtleties and complexities
and interplays -- dodie and judy and joe and david b and henry are main people
i'll look to backchannel when i am trying to tease out strange knots of a
dilemna, but dodie and judy are most often the ones who'll say the difficult,
perhaps confrontational stuff in an honest, vulnerable way i really respect...

sometimes when defensive, one attributes to "enemy" qualities one embodies
in oneself.  dale, i haven't seen you back down on anything you've been
mistaken about, including that woeful misreading of sylvester pollet.  if
you've done it, it hasn't registered.  i have seen you, in the short time
you've been on the list, attack much more often than i've seen dodie do,
and when i've seen dodie it isn't an attack so much as an honest "this is
what i'm seeing and think.  tell me if i'm mistaken" -- and i've told her,
when i didn't know her, that i thought she was mistaken and we talked about
it and dale, she didn't call me a single name.  that was when i learned how
useful (if one can get over the guilt of bothering her when she is so
overcommitted) dodie is in teasing out a complex problem.

i've seen posts that turn wheels dale.  some of yours do.  a number haven't.
i've seen dodie's response to wheel turners -- see for instance working
class thread of about a year ago, or another gender issue thread much like
the one current of about a year ago as well.  see dodie on small presses, on
contests (from this summer) and in one of the finest dodie moments, the funding
process for small presses and series.  she described, with blistering honesty,
what she does to get money for SPT, being on grant committees that distribute
(or don't) money, and my heavens it elicited some extraordinary responses from
others, from her again, from others.  when wheel turners come dodie's way, i
would say, again, her most consistent response is some wild leap in a direction
either one hadn't looked, or it was uncomfortable and therefore not done, to
look.  oh, another fine dodie moment -- writing and sexuality and erotica, also
this summer and a few months earlier as well.  then another leap.  then someone
leaps elsewise and dodie goes there and comes back, or over, etc.

if you are feeling there is another reaction to your posts from dodie, you
might re-examine what she reacts to in terms of its "wheel-turning" capacity.
i wouldn't call name-calling wheel turning, but rather, an attempt to break
the wheel.  and you might want to settle with dodie backchannel why it is you
are having those responses?

i don't want to get to the point of deleting your posts unread -- your post
on adorno and langpo is still making wheels turn and i'm not yet ready to post
response, it was that dense and interesting.  but i really don't get anything
out of attacks on people and nastiness for the sake of stirring things up.  i
keep ending up responding to latter, because i'm irish and i hate seeing people
hurt or bullied (alot of what motivates dodie i think.  it might also be a female
response -- we are socialized to nurture and protect, not tear down and eat while wiggling then pee on remains).  but i don't like it -- it makes my stomach
hurt and my blood pressure rise and my chocolate consumption go up.  i've noticed as people enter list, they try and make a "stir" by posting nasty posts and
flames and attacking in the name of "being provocative."  i know i did it
myself, and did it out of mostly insecurity.  i wonder if there could be
something in welcome message to reassure people and disable attack/make a stir
reflex?

Actually, I did backchannel Dodie last week.  A couple of times.  She
didn't respond to either.

I apologize to the list.  It's not as dull and self-serving as I
suggest.  If it serves any one, as I can tell, it's me.  I got $5 for a
magazine yesterday.

I haven't read your question to me re: Pollet yet.  Will though.  I
assumed he was white because he said so.  But, I could have
misinterpreted.

Could we all try to keep personal jabs, as opposed to critiques of ideas,

Subject:      Re: *Chain* & what one likes

Certainly one's *feelings* are central to making aesthetic judgements.  But
although our feelings are our own, they originate in cultural values.  So,
whether we like "this" rather than "that" depends first of all on our
culture.  The breadth of one's culture is what makes it possible to recognize
the conflict of values competing within and for the cultural field.  Indeed,
as the art critic de Duve argues -- sensitivity to art involves experiencing
this conflict of values as a conflict of feelings.  Art -- at least
experimentalist art -- is something one feels *conflictually*: "you give your

judgements are not questions of "taste," but depend on a willingness and a

reactionary or an adventurous way -- but most importantly it involves the

*given* or whether it is, instead a generative & a constructivist practice.

jacques, that's all very nicely put, but---

here comes henry!...

really though:  poetry in fact, poetic practice/process, is also
characterized by being free (as it were) to push past the cultural
moment... whether in its actual articulation or ex post facto is not
*necessarily* the point... the point is the imagined effort... which, if
you like, you can insist on seeing as sociocultural---and i do mself in
many ways, on many occasions---but which, too, may be regarded in terms of
the singular, much as one's fingerprint, the significance or insignificance
of which is perhaps buried under that term "talent" you've, uhm, deployed
(and i see it this way too on occasion)...

nice post, anyway!...

I'd like to concur that I hate this "provoke to
get the truth" thing as much as I hate it in
Adorno (anyone who dismisses Stravinsky as Adorno
does is profoundly non-post-modernist, or sane,
would be Adornoesque about Adorno). I enter this
thread only to put in a poem on it coincedentally
composed two days ago

        add-or-no-
        straction.

I think Adorno's idea of negative dialectic is
nuts, non-Hegel, you caan't force others into
dialectic, on your terms, and ditto with
"ab-straction" ie like ab-sent, to be recognised
as departing. Thus there must be ad-straction,
thus ad-straction or no straction at all, plus
a pun on Adorno...

i think it possible to articulate provocative ideas and unpopular positions
without the kind of personal attack the below instanciates. plenty of folks
disagree with each other here, but accusing others of laziness (rusty gears
in your head) and imputing motives to them is indecorous. your post on
adorno was insightful and interesting but your attack on spt police
uncalled for (the idea of SPT being in a policing role was so incongruous
to me that i thought you must mean something else by SPT that i didn't know
about).  actually, now that i think about it, i did say something about the
avant garde "policing its borders" a few months ago and got some defensive
but on the whole thoughtful responses that made me realize my wording had
been infelicitous.

I never really grokked the otherness of being Jewish until I moved off the
East Coast to Texas. People I met there couldn't understand why I found
the months of compulsory Christmas muzak in the malls irritating (at
best) -- until I asked them how they'd like being forced to listen
continually to Mantovani's Greatest Islamic Chants. On the other hand,
that's when I started viewing being Jewish as interesting, which had a big
effect on my own studies and writing.

I have friends in Texas who have bemoaned their own lack of ethnicity.
When they leave the state, though, they find out that being Texan is its
own thing, and (especially those with recognizably Texan accents) have to
deal with both being stereotyped by others, and the way that other parts
of the country are very different. (Since coming back East, it strikes me
how rarely people smile around here!)

I don't know if San Diego has its equivalent of Tuxedo Park or Lake Forest
or Grosse Point
(these last, Maria, are in the midwest), but I suspect it does. For those
of you who don't know, Jews can't buy houses in these places. Quogue on
Long Island, if I'm not mistaken, is another. I suspect that the California
cities have similar suburbs, but I know for sure that there are places in
San Diego county where being Jewish would be none to comfortable. Lest we
glorify the wide open spaces of the West in contrast to the decadent East,
remember that some of those wide open spaces are between the ears of
militia members and Aryan Nation types.

WHAT?!  YUCK! how are jews prevented from buying -- is it outright question

salespeople do?  what happens if someone jewish DOES buy?  i am reminded of
way temp companies in boston screen out black office workers.  they administer
typing tests, grammar tests, and it is awful because you see black woman who
has worn her desk to paper learning to type faster hunched over machine and
slamming out script like blazes.  and office type overseeing administration,
and interview, nods nicely and says "good good, we'll call when we have
something" and then they never call.  but next in line white worker like
me takes typing test, doesn't type as fast even, and it's "well we have a
job HERE, and HERE, and how about we send you out to BLAH company today"
and one thinks, at those moments, about the rent check, about walking out,
about saying something,... and perhaps one has said somthing a time or two
and the personnel type, who moments ago was "othered," the enemy, looks
drawn and miserable and says my boss said i can't send black workers there,
and they have said they don't want them, and we'll lose the account if we
send them, and they make them miserable if we do...  and who wins.  who loses.
what is the stunning gesture that paralyzes snakes in their tracks and charms
us all to sweet water again?

This is all such complicated stuff, since we all have multiple locations.
When I think about "being Jewish," I think of it relative to other identities
I have, which range from being white to being a product of the upper class.
I also think about it relative to my ability to "pass" as non-Jewish
(voluntary omission of the fact of my Jewishness) or my inability to be
recognized as Jewish (involuntary exclusion).  I think of it in relation
to my decision to become an African Americanist, in relation to my kinship
network (my extended family is comprised of German/Eastern European Jews
and Puerto Rican Episcopalians), and so on.  We are none of us able to be
expressed by a singular, unified, identity.  We're always this *and* that
*and* that *and* that....

To sort out some of the identification issues, I tend to divide my identity
markers into a couple of classes.  The first is identity which is marked
in the body.  My femaleness falls in that category, as does my whiteness.
Both are hard to hide, hard to represent as other than they are.  Body markers
are a big deal--they're the most in-your-face kinds of identity tags, and
most of the reactions I get from other people are predicated, first of all,
*on* those markers.  (And working in e-space is fascinating, because those
markers are removed and the name-tag I wear is most often mistaken for
non-white and male.)  An interesting thing about body markers, of course, is
that they're easily misread.  I don't "look Jewish," whatever that means,
and so I am marked, on the basis of my body, by both Jews and non-Jews as
"not a Jew."  In the U.S., there's a body marker category called "Asian"
which lumps together ethnic groups whose members consider each other to be
racially distinct--Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, etc.  Such "mistakes" lead
to questions like "what is Jewishness?" or "what is blackness?"  or even
"what
is race?" Lots of questions to wrestle with here.

After the body markers come what I think of as the "image tags," or the
deliberate ornamentation/style I adopt to convey certain messages about who
I am.  A shaved head, visible tattoes, piercings, leather, and so on.  Or
high heels, stockings, lace, a lotta cleavage.  Or dreads. Or a kafiyah.  Or
or or.  These tags have everything to do with what I want other people to
think I am, but they are deliberately constructed, not inherent qualities.
(I've had a couple of friends--both male, coincidentally--who were of a
color and a "type" which was totally racially indeterminate.  Both of them
identified as "nonwhite"--and that is the general category they used--all
the time, but one wavered back and forth between that broader category and
East Asian Indian, and the other fluctuated between "nonwhite" and "black."
On any given day they expressed their preferences and inclinations by the
image tags they chose.  As a "racial Everyman"--their term, not mine--they
were assumed to be members of the dominant local nonwhite race, whatever
that was, by the members of that group.  In Texas, Chicanos spoke Spanish
to them, in Georgia African Americans assumed they were black, and white
folks everywhere usually assumed they were white.  They'd have to resist
that definition by donning contradictory image tags, or it would be imposed
upon
them as a default.)

And then there are the internal tags, the "what-I-think-of-me-as" category
of stuff I feel is somehow integral, but ultimately invisible.  Like, hey,
I know I'm a Jew even though I'm not exactly sure what Jewishness is (a
race? a religion? a dessert topping?).  There are days when I think I'm a
Jew only because at other times and places people would have killed me for
being a Jew, or because *if* people knew I was a Jew they wouldn't let me
into their clubs, or because I'm sitting around and laughing and talking
with a bunch of other people and we share what--for lack of a better word--
I have to call a "Jewish heritage," meaning that we laugh at the same
jokes, share inflections, stories.  Then there are other days when I
feel a kind of connection to the myths I know as "Jewish history," even
though I never feel any connection (and actually feel an antipathy) to
anything smacking of the "Jewish religion."  And I always *know* I'm not
black.  I never wake up in the morning with any doubt about that. These
are the markers that I wear inside, and that are mostly invisible, even to me.

Stereotyping both combines the first two categories to create a kind of
shorthand for the determination of "what" a person is, and influences the
self-concept which shapes the development of the internal tags.  (I am
what I say I am, so I have to be careful about what I say I am; I am /
am not what you say I am, so I wish you'd be careful about what you
say I am.)

Aldon posted that great list of books (I'm glad someone added Aldon's
to the list), and I'd like to add one more:  Michael Omi & Howard Winant's
revised edition of _Racial Formations_.  Great stuff. I tend to believe
that there *are* no "real" races, that identity along racial lines is
wholly constructed, but that we construct it because the urge to Otherize
is
hardwired into the wetware; it's part of what makes us human beings.  So
racial constructions change with the times (remember when the Irish were
black?), but the urge to construct races is a constant.  We construct
Others and we construct ourselves alla the time.  The best we can do, I
think, is try to be aware of who we're constructing, and how and why,
who it hurts, who benefits, how the system we move within is structured
to determine races and classes and genders and other Others here and now.

Here's how it works. In the old days when you bought a house from a real
estate agent in these towns you signed a contract requiring you to resell
through that same agent if you decided to leave. The agents did the
dirty-work of deciding who to show to. Those contracts were declared
illegal about fifteen years ago, so it's done informally now, and an
occasional jew, or italian, etc., slips through. In Lake Forest, where I
spent a summer at an art colony, my understanding was that a very few
blacks were allowed in as long as they played football for the Chicago team
(sorry, I don't follow the game--I'd rather watch paint dry).
So the process was distanced from its beneficiaries. What's striking is
that no one ever seems to wake up in the morning wondering why all of his
neighbors seem so similar.
