   Well this maybe doesn't mean anything in terms of generalities and/or
   may say more about me than about the ostensible subject matter but
   i've taught both contemporary poetry and Shakespeare and the 'average
   person' seems to get Shakespeare more than the poetry i teach, now
   maybe if I taught say Gerald Stern (gag) rather than say Carla Harryman
   or Jack Spicer they'd get contemporary poetry more. Furthermore, they
   don't necessarily GET the lingo of Shakespeare but "get" the story and
   so they walk around with this illusion of understanding it which
   contemporary poetry doesn't give them---which may actually be WORSE!

I'm with you Chris. I used to have this beef at dept meetings: why is it
Shakespeare gets equal time with the rest of literature. That was the
curriculum, THE CANON for a time. Not so much any more. I complained but the
students...no. And now we have SHAKESPEARE ON FILM and do they beat the
doors down to get into that.

Subject:      gimmicks/"poetry" that's got nothin' on zimmerman

   Awhile Back, Mark Wallace complained (or STATED) that a poet needs
   THEORY these days if s/he wants to teach. Either that or a really good
   hustler. Of course if one's a good hustler, why would one WANT to teach
   ? So, it seems this issue is coming up again. We see the SHAKESPEARE
   issue--and we see the ELECTRONIC and "audio/visual" culture issue...
   yes, poetry is not enough academically--one needs some kinda GIMMICK.
   Yeah, man, I DO like Bob Dylan (as a poet) better than Gerald Stern
   (who's may safe whipping boy, a metonymy for many others, many parts
   of me)--but there are so many silly hybrids out there.
   And not only that ALlen Ginsberg has a LOUSY voice!
   And not only that the Brannagh version of MUCH ADO could have been
   much better...
   It's all way to "middle brow" isn't it? It is far more fun (tis a
   far far better thing) to go to a loud thrash like concert and come
   back and read something like Wallace Stevens than to try to pretend
   that "poetry
               " that ain't got nuthin' on zimmerman, is more soulless
    than even your basic garage band IN ADDITION to being something that
    doesn't hold up under repeated readings, is going to be something
    we should like....heavy yawn "I used to be disgusted now I try to
    be amused...." CS

More evidence of life beyond SPD: Today I received a chapbook in the
mail (such free exchanges of publications being our own form of
samizdat) which delighted & astounded me: _Dirt_ by Jim Leftwich
(Luna Bisonte Prods, 137 Leland Ave., Columbus OH 43214, no price),
saddle-stapled, tan cover w/ mutant calligraphy in green ink,
containing 14 pp. of rapturous, recombinant "neo-prose" made partly
of words you won't find in any dictionary:
           by rave brome scalp ledge has to that's. ark of retuse
           bathe. mesquite quota bort livid noel. elute is part of

           prayers wisp evil ration into which.
Throughout the book, Jim is "morphing" morphemes with the speed of
sound, maybe a verbal equivalent of saxophonist Evan Parker's
circular breathing technique. *Here's* what poetry is like without
SPD (I like SPD and am glad it exists, yet it has many limitations
which less institutionalized, more grassroots forms of poetic
interchange can & should circumvent.)

Subject:      who wrote this???

  The other day I found some poems laying on a quite boring quasi-suburban
   street in a tiny town that only has CHAIN bookstores (and some used)
   Suprisingly, the poem isn't totally hideous....and in some ways resemble
   H.D. There are four poems: "OLD MATH" "THE SEA OUTSIDE" :THE HIATUS"
    and "BREAKTHROUGH"----
      I am curious if any one knows who wrote them?
            BREAKTHROUGH

            Fields migrate into gold
            the sea sprawls out of its chains

            the scene's torn
            the light patched

            water cuffs the air
            while the bay laughs
            starlings sown like grain

            with a knowing wink of dark
            an airplane crosses noon

            the equinox leaps
            through the clock

            clouds fall upwards
            the moon feels tall
            the sky keels south
            what blooms is the wind

I want to say there's something really goofy about these poems,and maybe
I'm only stopped because it may have been written by someone I'm SUPPOSSED to like---Yes, SPENCER, what's in a name? But what is poetr suppossed to do? to be?

Bravo to Chris Funkhouser! for pointing out the idiocy of seeing poetry
more or less only as print, even though he admits that print has various
important values. As one of the print book makers he values, I must say
that I agree wholeheartedly, and have also committed my own work to
various media, from taped to electronic to print. Radio has received some
of the most valuable, although it doesn't add up to a lot of hours. And I
had one of my greatest revelations when, after a long period of being
disturbed about the closure (books are closed for 99.9% of their lives,
but I'm sure someone will dispute that statistic) of print, I simply
realized that, once read, a work is never closed. So, while I'll continue
to make books which can be held and read (or at least as long as it
doesn't seem too insane to use paper, and, if it gets to that point, I do
know how to make paper), I hope to also keep on getting work into other
media which I hold as no less valuable, some of them media for which we
have yet to discover their sensual characteristics.

Thanks, Andrew Joron, for the excerpt from DIRT. But I think that, not
only is Jim Leftwich morphing morphemes, he's sounding phonemes,
something I've been finding, lately, more rare and more valuable. The
value of DIRT is not fully experienced without sounding the work, and not
only hearing/sounding, but feeling the mouth make those sounds. It's
physical work of the highest order. Thank you for pointing it out. I
think I'd like to find the book's physical equivalent of THAT.

QUEENSLAND STUDIES CENTRE ANNUAL CONFERENCE - 8-9 JULY



WAR'S  END?


August 1945 marked the end of the most harrowing and transforming
collective experience in the history of modern Australia.  How much of the
'old' Australia came to an end with the cessation of hostilities, and how
much continued as before? What different meanings did the War's end have
for different groups and institutions in Australian society?

The Queensland Studies Centre will be holding its annual two-day
conference, in association with the History Department of James Cook
University, in Townsville, on 8-9 July of this year.

The conference will be interdisciplinary in scope,  embracing military,
social and cultural history; politics and political economy; literary and
cultural studies. Papers exploring any of the following aspects of the
topic would be welcome:

* literature and the arts
* education and social policy
* Aboriginal and ethnic communities
* women's history
* military and social history
* politics and industrial relations
* journalism and the media

Subject:      Zen & lango

A friend who likes Leslie Scalapino's material
asks about how Zen may figure in her writing practice.

I notice names like Steve Benson,John  Cage,
Alan Davies,Jackson Mac Low,Leslie Scalapino and Armand
Schwerner in _Beneath a Single Moon_ (ed. Kent
Johnson & Craig Paulenich), which is an anthology of
Bhuddist/Zen/Poetry related poets.

If Zen (or another spiritual) practice has a part in
your writing, or you know of material that may be
interesting in this regard, please let me know.

My friend and I thought maybe the porousness of language
writing may be a very spiritual thing.  But, as I
say, would welcome any information, thoughts you may have.

John Geraets--

On Zen & poetry & Leslie Scalapino.  Funny you should ask.  You might
want to take a look at the writing of Norman Fischer (recently
elevated to the status of zen abbot -- based in San Francisco).  His
most recent book, from Chax, PRECISELY THE POINT BEING MADE,
is quite marvelous.  And zen-nish.  I mention Norman in connection
with Leslie because the two of them are currently writing back and
forth, a series of poems and letters that definitely do push & pull
around zen practice.  You might try writing directly to Leslie
Scalapino or to Norman if you're interested in looking at this
exchange-in-progress.

Subject:      Intro & Question
In-Reply-To:  <199505020409.VAA21383@>

Hello everybody,

I'm new to this list, though a few of you may know(of) me...I publish the
paper and web versions of the magazine _Cyanosis_ the second issue of
which is recently out. Submission guides are available via e-mail (but
one should see the publication before submitting). #1 is $8.00 for a
sample. #2 is $10.00, they're 8.5x11, perfect bound, B&W #1=112pp,
#2=212pp. Work by (2) Selby, Albon, Daniel Davidson, Gary Sullivan, Marta
Dieke, Jeff Conant, John McNally, Steven Schutzman, Ben Marcus, Brian
Schorn, and many others...a lot of very unusual graphic material as well
as interviews with a robticist, a photographer and a nuerosurgeon!

That aside (please pardon the plug)...a little about myself/interests and
a question:

I'm interested in most art forms, the relationship between science/art
and the psyche. My writing is concerned primarily with what I would call
'shifts of attention' wherein refocussing of attention provides for a
reinterpretation of the relationships between beings, objects and events.
I would classify myself as a poet concerened both with metaphysics and
music, passionately, sometimes violently involved with questions of the
nature of being.

Well...that sure sound pretentious in retrospect!

And now a question to the list...

I need help locating both Brian Schorn and Ben Marcus, if anyone knows

Re CXhris Stroffolino's message of May 1.
Who is Gerald Stern? Is that an in-joke?
One knows some of the work of Harryman, and one has been
reading/teaching Spicer since 1963.
But one has never heard of Gerald Stern. I thought that was the name
of that New York radio morning guy with the long hair.

Not only was Pound being ironic in that advice to give up poetry, as
there's nothing in it---he was quoting his figure who stands in for
Arnold Bennett.

read (and write) poetry. David Phillips is a terrific poet who works
as a carpenter. Bob Fones is a very good poet who works as a

Tony,

I think Riemke Ensing has an interest in Zen, if only as part of a general
interest in Eastern aesthetics:

<i>The Katherine Mansfield Signature as Zen Painting</i>:<p>
<pre>
        No doubt about that fine down line turning
        up the tail end of a winter
        branch. Definitely
        Niten's <i>Shrike</i> and maybe Tohaku
        is there making mountains
        in the morning mist.

(Ignore the <> bits, they're just HTML codes for italics and so on.)

Bernadette Hall's poetry has been described as having a `Zen-like concentration
on the spiritual behind the real', and of course Baxter was introduced to Zen
by his son Hoani. It's just a stab in the dark, but my reading of _Autumn
Testament_ leads me to think that Baxter was about to renounce Catholicism in
favour of something resembling Zen Buddhism before he died.

Gerald Stern is a poet in his 60s who I believe teaches in Florida
these days. He was one of the first academic free verse writers of the
post WW2 era to define a style that was pointedly "non Iowa City" but
no more interesting (to my eye) for it. He has had a profound (perhaps
devastating) influence on poets whose work I have some fondness for,
such as Jack Gilbert (the Yale Younger Poet of the early 60s who
attended Spicer's Magick Workshop) and Linda Gregg. Betwixt the three
there's a whole little Gerald Stern cult out there somewhere. He
occasionally does commentaries on NPR where he seems primarily to be
Andrei Codrescu without the professional accent.

i'd encourage _everyone_ who publishes work to consider
adding their information to the UPC's WWW site, by filling
in the following templates & returning them to me, luigi,
at:
               au463@cleveland.freenet.edu


lbd


*****************************************************************
all this talk about puttin' stuff on the net makes it
sound hard-to-do & scary, but it's not.  it does take
a little time, which lots of us are short on.  so here's
a stab at distributing the work, & making it less
threatening...

okay, so here's 2 "templates" to use to construct
publisher's pages for the Electronic Poetry Center.
There are 2 parts here: the first part is a "publisher's
page", which will present overall information about your
press plus a list of publications that you have available.
the second part is a template that you'll fill out for
each individual title--if you have 5 titles, you'll need
to make 5 separate copies, one for each title.  in practice,
readers will see the first page describing the press, and
the list of titles will be "hotlinks", allowing them to
select and jump to the information about the specific title.

How to do it:
^^^^^^^^^^^^
-->instuctions relating to filling in these templates are
enclosed between rows of asterix *****, just like this
intro is.  you can delete the instructions, or i will.

-->the bits of information on the templates that you've
gotta fill in are [enclosed in brackets]--just replace all
the stuff in brackets (& the brackets themselves) with the
appropriate info.  for example, i'd replace:

     <H1>[NAME OF YOUR PRESS--all caps]</H1>

with:

     <H1>BURNING PRESS</H1>

ignore, _but leave in place_, all the other stuff ("<HTML>" etc.--
that's the formatting stuff, and it becomes invisible to the reader
when they're viewing  the document; other text is just the framework
into which you're fitting your information--change it as appropriate).
some of the data may seem redundent--but different parts are used by
the system in different ways...  trust me.

after you're done, send it all back to me, i'll do a little
cleaning up (and installing the links), and send it on to Loss
for inclusion in the EPC.

this is an experiment, & i'll be interested to see how it works.
if you have any questions, just write me (luigi) at:

          au462@cleveland.freenet.edu.

Subject:      Re: Zen & lango

Thinking of the influence of zen buddhism (and other traditions of
buddhism also) on poets like Alan Davies and Jackson Mac Low, I also
thought of how (if I have my facts straight) Alan was brought up in the
Seventh Day Adventist tradition, as was John Taggart, another poet with
both a strong spiritual and strong puritan streak. One could of course
ask these questions of other traditions as well....

Kathy Acker and Hannah Weiner, for example, both have had significant
encounters with hindu traditions.

Also, while we're noting zen poets, Alan Senauke, a priest at the
Berkeley Zen Center, was a NY School poet (trained by Koch et al at
Columbia where he co-edited an anthology of student writing that was
pretty lively, called The Cinch, as I recall) and later a bluegrass
musician. Steve Abbott died at the hospice run by Whalen's group in SF.

I'm not joking, Ron, and others.  There are two Sterns (Gerry).  One
is Jerry Stern who does commentaries on NPR.  He's a fiction writer
based at Florida State.  Gerald Stern, who usually teaches at Iowa,
and who taught here at Alabama, is a poet who works in emotional
saturated long lines, has a reputation as a hip jewish version of
Whitman, etc.  Wins lots of awards.  Was a childhood buddy of Jack
Gilbert (as for Ron's sketch on influence, it could go the other
way, Gerry idolizes Jack and vice versa).  Gerry's career got a late
start with Lucky Life when Gerry was perhaps in his early to mid
forties.  Since then, an avalanche of books.  He's a "dramatic"
reader, very popular with the MFA gravy train, much anthologized,
awarded, and in some circles powerful.... etc. etc.etc.

Subject:      aleatoric composition, using chance

Hallo everyone,

I just wanted to float a topic, because Ron mentioned Jackson MacLow, and
we've been talking about Zen.
        I'm very interested in aleatoric composition, in New Music
Composition, famously with John Cage, and also in writing, famously also
with Cage as well as MacLow and others.
        I'd be really interested in anyone off or on list discussing with
me (and informing me over) some things that have been interesting me.
        Mostly: how is chance conceived?

Does it have to be random?

Does the artist have to turn over the work to chance, for it to be proper
aleatoric work? Karlheinz Stockhausen uses chance as part of his process,
generating values within a composition he's set up, letting chance set
up the composition but putting in his own values, editing afterwards etc.
If chance is a kind of experimentation, where is the research write-up?
Shouldn't there be at least some, sometimes?

        Also: can chance be oracular?

If one is consulting an oracle, the I-Ching, the Tarot, isn't it potentially
sacriligeous to use it to generate non-ego, randomness etc? Isn't it a bit
colonialist, like picking up the I-Ching on one's travels and using it as
a toy? How much interest is there, or recognition, of artists using
aleatoric methods as a kind of rune casting, to produce something more true,
that surprises and sobers her/him?

I'd very much appreciate anyone's thoughts - especially you, Herb, as we've
been talking a bit about this privately, and I'd really like to hear your
New Music background come in, or you, Cris, ditto, or any of us who have
been talking from the mystical side of agnosticism rather than the athiest
secular side,

Ira

John Geraets,
The visiting Chinese scholar Zhang Zing (sp? - Hank?) told me
he is working with two groups of poets in China--a "language"
group, with interest in parallel developments here, and a zen
group, whose work is naturalistic and lyrical. According to
Zhang, these groups are basically antithetical, with no overlap.
He was surprised when I told him about the common ground here
(Fischer, Davies, et al.) Subsequently, I wrote a brief essay for
Zhang on Zen & poetry, focusing on my own practice and quoting
a couple of koans from the Gateless Barrier (Mumonkan). I can
send it to you if you like.

I too love this subject, as it happens. What interests me is the
role of agency. It seems, as with Jackson M., that the removal
of agency, if that is possible, calibrates as much chance as Oulipo
does by setting strictures, by heightening agency. Any thoughts on
this paradox? Or is it just a paradox to me?

  Dear George Bowering---
   I used to think Howard Stern was better than Gerald Stern, but then he
   helped get Pataki elected. Gerald Stern is a kind "Iowa School" poet
   who didn't get famous until he was mid-50's or so but has won over the
   "mainstream" "unpolitical" "suburban" proletariat crowd in many ways.
   When I was in college he read. The editor of my college poetry magazine
   was absolutely OBSESSED with him....he has a poem that ends with the
   lines:
          I lean on my right side for words
          And on my left side for music
  (something like that) this just knocked her out, for some reason i'll
  never understand...anyway, ironies of ironies, I read with the guy in
  Phila. in 1987....He would tell the "story behind the poem"--I wrote
  this when i was sitting on the back porch while my family was inside
  watching t.v." then he'd begin the poem, "I was on the back porch
  and my family was inside watching T.V." even my then 15 year old sister
  thought it was absurd....we prefered Paul Westerburg who had just released
   "Pleased To Meet Me"---
       "One foot in the door, the other foor in the gutter
        The sweet smells that you adore. I think I'd rather smother...."
    Hope this answers your question.....Chris Stroffolino

Well, you cant fault Shakespeare for not developing female
characters, either, L. Because the idea of a character in literature
had not yet been invented. Now that we dont believe in them any more,
we should be able to read Shakes better than people could 50 years
ago. Maybe not, but it seems as if it should be true. But I do agree
with you that Shakespeare's sonnets are a dream. One coulkd take them
for a year to a desert isle and survive on them.

Subject:      Re: aleatoric composition, using chance

A similar thread came up in the experiwhat? discussions and I'm repeating
some remarks from previous posts.

'In this day and age' we can no longer ignore the possibilities of working
in 'real time' when composing *using* chance.

The machine allows us to generate results and adjust processes fast enough
for there to be subsequent composition of the procedures themselves, such
that these procedures may be adjudged/selected/devloped for their richness.

Processes can also be open-ended, feeding back into themselves. I have a
new piece that learns phrases selected from generated text by the reader.
The reader's copy of the piece is changed irreversibly by adding
selections. Since the generative process is based on frequencies of
collocations (word juxtapositions) the piece will eventually be dominated
by phrases selected by the reader. (It would probably also eventually choke
on the amount of text generated and selected. BTW this is probably also
properly 'chaotic' -- literary turbulence slowly drawn towards a 'strange
attractor', nudged into place by the reader.)

The aleatory is here being *used* and *composed* sometimes by the reader.

Cris and Ira, I know, have seen the work I have done for Macintosh machines
and which moves in this direction.

Other references -- I don't think they been mentioned yet -- are:
Charles O. Hartman & Hugh Kenner (yes, *the* Hugh Kenner) _Sentences_ by
Sun & Moon, 1995 (I've just rec'd it) which prints results from applying
O'Rourke & Kenner's 'Travesty' program and Hartman's programming of Mac
Low's diastic method (v. similar to my own 'mesostic hologograms').
Neither can we ignore the Fluxus and Emmett Williams, esp. say, his
'ultimate poetry' (_A Valentine for Noel_ etc.)

Ira, A few thoughts in response to the topic you've floated.  When trust
supplies the foundation for engagement with chance practices, miracles can
happen.  The process seems to require a complete letting go to work as it
can (note the absence of "should").  I became wildly interested in 12-tone
music during my undergrad studies in music theory and composition.  And
later in writing set up structures or configurations that could serve as
containers (not strong enough and at the same time too strong a word) that
released me from simultasking on infrastructure and sound or meaning.

I'm most interested in chance practices by Jackson MacLow and others, partly
because of what happens when confidence and the wide open possibilities
intersect.

The establishing of arbitrary (but are they?) structures that one finds or
invents for generative practice can lead to very worthwhile findings.  I
don't mean to preach my interest, as you obviously have yours.  Just a quick
say so.  Glad to be thinking about this again and again.

Subject:      Aleatory Poetry

As I understand it, John Cage uses --in his poetry--  an arbitrary
sequencing to guarantee perpetual freshness and spontaneity--to force
the poetic genius constantly to invent for itself and assert itself
in new ways.

If that's not quite right, perhaps all the better. After all, we are
not talking about reaching agreement on anything.

But what occurred to me some time ago is that in poetry written in
the  lnaguage we speak, call it English or American, the use of rhyme
does the same thing. What a crazy thing, rhyme! What an irrational
thing to do! To pick a word not for its meaning but just because it
happens to sound the same as another word! Especially to do so in
this language where rhyme words are so much harder to find than in
Italian where everything feminine rhymes with everything else
feminine.

Using rhyme is like using the random-number generator in a computer.
It automatically introduces irrationality or unpredictability--if you
want it to. For example, would it ever occur to anyone to write a
poem in which one went from "moon" to "pantaloon" in the space of a
few words. And as far as I can remember no one has.

Or "Prester John's Balloon." In this case someone has.

The problem may be that over the centuries the irrationality has been
squeezed out, and we need new and fresh sources of nuttiness. Too
many dried up peels and husks lying around--"June", "croon", etc.

There's nothing wrong with Cage's theory; it's just the practice.
Banging on pot lids is fun to listen to for a few minutes.
 Has anyone ever shouted out "Encore!" at the end of Cage's piece
 that requires nothing but a few minutes of total silence?

For real inventiveness try May Swenson's poem, "The Watch." Its
organization is determined by an irrational principle as well. Or
perhaps it would be better to say, its lines are dislocated by a new
type--found only in that poem--of random-number machine.

Two Gerald Sterns, two David Shapiros, and--for the record--two William
Staffords. The poet and the editor (of MODERN FICTION STUDIES). The poet,
early on, used his middle initial, "E," and the editor, later on, used his
middle initial, "T." I wonder what _difference_, if any, the initial-ing

Maybe we're thinking of different aspects of Mac Low's work, but I think
both Mac Low and (some, at least, of) the Oulipians are doing similar
things.  I don't see the distinction you're making between chance and
strictures, when you look at the actual systems in use.  If you gave an
example it might help me understand what you mean.

For instance, I'm not sure that I see a functional difference between, say
selecting words by the position of letters from a certain index word or
phrase, or others of Mac Low's strategies and selecting, say the seventh
word after a noun in the dictionary.  They're both ways to get around
using the easy ways of writing that standard syntax allows us/forces us
to fall into.

In-Reply-To:  <199505031934.AA01519@mail.eskimo.com>

Since <silence>, the John Cage mailing list, is lately (& sometimes
interestingly) bogged down with bibliographic issues regarding the
provenance of various scores by Cage in chronological order, I guess it
makes sense to discuss chance composition here.

Ira raises asks the question <Does it have to be random?> In most ways I
think the question is more accurately stated <_Can_ it be random?>.  I
don't think it can be entirely random though there are certainly a
wide range of how much the expected sound or word can be avoided.

Once a composer or poet or whoever has selected the gamut or aggregate
upon which the change processes are to operate, once the composer or poet
has decided how to interpret the chance operations, there are enough
elements of taste and choice involved to eliminaate any true, or at least
total <randomness>.  Rather, the chance elements allow the artist to
arrive at an array of events and structures that are not prescribed by an
individual's sense of taste or rules.  In music this may include the rules
of melody or harmony, in poetry, rules of syntax or discourse.

(There is, BTW, a very good book on Cage's compositional processes called
<The Music of John Cage> by James Pritchett, published by Cambridge
University Press.  At least those of you at colleges and universities
should be able to get it from a library.  As may be clear to those of you
who have heard and not just read about Cage's music, there is often a
structure to it, and sometimes its an audible one.  These structures
simply don't fit any of the standard musical syntaxes.  Does this sound
familiar to any poets out there?)

In, say, <Music of Changes> for solo piano, or <Concerto for Prepared
Piano and Chamber Orchestra, John Cage uses the I Ching to order events,
etc.  but he is selecting from a range of (very small) events he has
previously composed.  In later works, such as <Atlas Eclipticalis> or
(much later) <Etudes Borealis>, star charts are used as the original
source material for "randomly" selecting notes, but Cage determines how
the charts are used and follows this system with a degree of rigor.

In other works, say <Music Walk> and <Fontana Mix>, performers use
materials provided by Cage to generate a score from which they perform.
In these cases, Cage has very little control over the actual sonic outcome
of the work, but he has _some_ control over how the sounds are chosen.

But very few of Cage's works are this free and, in many ways, he was
always in control of his music, he simply was not using the same systems
as others were to structure his music.  In fact, he rarely used the same
system more than a couple of times to generate his music.  It's this
constant move toward looking for new systems, rather than getting into a
stylistic schtick, that I find most appealing about Cage's music.

In Cage's poetry, his choice of source materials give the works form and
content to a great extent.  His various writings through Thoreau and
Finnegans Wake are about the source materials, as are his later Norton
poetry lectures, etc.  In his writing he was more upfront about the fact
that he made choices about how much of the source material to keep and
how much to discard in following through his formal structures.

In the various methodical writings of Jackson Mac Low, his selection of
the gamut of choices, works in similar ways. But, perhaps because he works
primarily as a writer, Mac Low has a wider range within his poetry than
Cage and isn't as simply dependent on formal decision structures.

As to Stockhausen, Ira, I don't see how your description of his use of
chance is much different than the way most artists have of trying stuff
out and seeing if it works.  (Our back channel mail about new music has only
let me know that my turntable needs a new part, so I still haven't
listened to the Stockhausen I have on hand lately.)

As to the colonialism implicit in the use of the I Ching by tourists for
non-oracular divination.  Well, as far as Cage goes, does it make it any
better if it turns out that Cage simply broke things down into no more
than 64 categories and used coins and or yarrow stalks to determine which
of the 64 categories to select?

Cage rarely used the oracular text of the I Ching to determine his
artistic choices.  I'm not sure how late it was developed but someone
eventually wrote a computer utility that randomly generated so in the
later years, he wasn't even using the tradition means of divination to
determine which of the categories to use.

There's plenty more to say, but I'll save it for now & see how others
respond.

H.T. Kirby-Smith's interesting post about the "irrationality" of rhyme as
a way of organizing poetic choices brings the discussion of chance
composition, in a way, to rhetoric.  Did anyone else see the piece in the
NYTimes about the susceptibility of the brain, to rhyme? In other words
there are reasons babies love to hear recitations of Dr. Suess.  (Lyric
as cry for Mama, as Barbara Johnson might say.)

I composed a long poem with a friend using dice.  We were delighted with
the results, but predictably maybe, no one was very interested in reading
the whole thing.  I mean the (inexistant) (?) metapoem was more
interesting than the poem, and we who did it were more excited than
anyone who read it.....

Try:  " Chance " operations in the arts commonly involve the selection of materials by
locating  the intersection of (usually) two systems, e.g. sounds,
spaces, durations, words, phrases -- with -- finite sets of numbers.

Note: although all possible results of these operations could be
produced by computer-processing (provided the numbers involved are
limited), the effect is usually to select one or more) of the
available possibilities.  In this way the selection(s) are put beyond
the range of what might be selected by unaided brain-power.

Thus large intersecting systems are pitted against deliberate choice.

The purposes for such designs vary from user to user and, judging by
the elaborate descriptions of process provided by Jackson Mac Low (to
which one or other of the Charles Bernstein's has drawn attention
before "me", one of the Anthony Green's), the purposes also vary with
each individual occasion of use.

What is clearly still deliberate and purposive is the positioning of
the "artist" and of the "audience".   This purposive character is apt
to confuse those who regard only the "chance" of the procedures,
thus neglecting artist-work-audience relations.

Intrstng, no?  as ever a Formalist reading taken alone is ineffectual
-- because it lacks a  Contextual reading (i.e. social/political)
& round we go again, folks.

Subject:      Re: aleatoric composition, us...

Ira,

Some random remarks on your interesting questions about chance.

In a sense, all composition is to greater or lesser degrees chance-generated.
 The conscious mind believes it is orchestrating things during writing,
making decisions, determining themes, etc, but often directions, lines of
investigation, phrases, words, etc., just pop in, get writtne down, edited,
etc.  These then lead in directions not originally envisioned...

Many so-called "chance-generated" texts (by Cage, Mac Low, myself, and
others) use very strictly structured methods to arrive at word choices, line
lengths, etc, etc.  Cage's computer-generated mesostics, for example.  Coin
tosses, dice throws, I Ching, random numbers keyed to dictionary entries are
all examples of structured approaches to opening the composition to "outside"
forces not usually thought of as directed by consciousness.

However, if one's sense of self includes the world (self as an "expanded
field" taking in "eveything"), these methods simply use other strategies,
forces, or parts of the world-self to formulate or generate the text.  "The
world is speaking through the pen or keyboard" is a natural feeling.
 Strictly speaking then, chance is not random, but directed in at least three
ways:

   - through the conscious mind apparently but not completely in charge of
its choices.
   - by using structured methods of text generation chosen and set into
motion by the conscious mind.
   - by allowing "natural forces" (such as gravity or random numbers) to
"have their say" in the outcomes of the above structured methods.

Hopefully others will also have ideas on this subject.

John

Herb Levy--

In response to your response I see what you mean.  There is some
similarity in what I see as a distinction, given your index and
syntax example.  Perhaps I m thinking of particular poems/works.
For example, Cage's piece wherein he set the trip beams in a bank(?)
and connected each one to a note or chord.  I see this as not
unlike Mac Low's "Antic Quatrains", the computer program config-
ured to create words derived from the subject, which happens to
be a name.  In both cases, the parameters of the poetic occasion
are established by the poet, but the system is autonomous in its
movemnt and development--chance takes over, or at least a semblence
of chance insofar as control has been relinquished.
But in Oulipo, or Ashbery, sometimes, the strictures force the
poet to  work within the system parameters, not leave and watch
it go.  It's an exercise in anti-intention, a work against the
sprawl of ego.  In this case, you might consider Ashbery's
Popeye sestina, whch I just recently read.
I hope this at least approaches an explication of what i meant.
Sorry about the typhos.

Best,
Ryan

Tom Kirby-Smith's post on rhyme as a <defamiliarization> (not the term he
used) technique is a useful one.

Formal constraints, whether they're older ones like rhyme or rhythmic
structure, or newer ones like Mac Low's or the Oulipians, _can_ serv as a
kick in the butt to a writer.  The trick is for the writer to stay
surprised while trying to focus on what she wants to say and having to
follow a set of rules can keep both the surprise and the dsired statemnt
in a interesting tension.  And, as Kirby-Smith notes, it's rare that rhyme
alone can do that anymore, for either the writer or the reader.

To paraphrase a sentiment from George Perec's author's note at the end of
<La Disparition> (since I don't have the recently published translation at
hand, my own loos translation DOES include words containing the letter
<e> and doesn't pars quite rightly>:

<And by carefully defining evrything formally, genrally having it just
keep looking more natural or producing quiet realism, sentences turn
unnaturally vital when xamining your zen-do.>

Or something like that.

Making <sentences turn unnaturally vital> <by carefully defining
everything formally> is what poetry is all about, isn't it?

approach.  It's  nice  to  have  the  evidence  distributed  with  the
assertion.

An important point, although the artist's actual (as oppsed to 'intended')
audience is indeterminate. Even the abdication of agency -- something which
does interest me -- implies an attitude to and a particular form of
engagement with even this form of literary production which the artist
presumably continues to view as such.

Which leads on the the OuLiPo, which had/?has an attitude to 'chance' that
was at best ambiguous and more often hostile. I think it is possible to
maintain a distinct between the application of arbitrary strictures
(anything in rhetoric really from lipograms and sestinas to rhyme and
metrics) and the use of (typically) random number generation to determine
the actual selection and recording of words/phrases/sentences (where the
medium is literary).

The OuLiPians wish to *overcome* the restrictions. Someone in the grip of
aleatoric processes wants to follow them and see where they will go.

Of course the distinction is never so clear. Arbitrary is arbitrary and
it's a matter of 'chance' that the artist (arbitrarily) applies a set of
strictures, however cleverly she overcomes the problems. Chance procedures
are always applied to previously structured and/or composed material and
the way they are applied is also chosen.

>the way they are applied ...

Once again: the machine you're sitting in front of is now a very flexible
tool for the composition of chance.

John's remarks remind me that after using consciously selected chance
methods, one's writing habits may expand, such that the exercises employed
are not required in quite the same way. For me, patterns add discipline that
is inherently cumulative.  There's a little of Houdini in this process, in
that (in some time types of chance applications)one creates obstacle courses
that one does not exactly escape, but rather include the surrounding material.

I've heard some writers say, for example, about some of the experiments,
such as those that Charles Bernstein recently shared on this list, that as
you engage with them, these methods more naturally become a part of one's
"own" methods.  (An inadvertent acquisitive suggestion!)

I find the use of chance methods envigorating at least.  And I am delighted
by so many of the results of that process in the work of other writers.

Subject:      Re: aleatoric composition (longish)

Noting what's been posted to this subject to date a first stumble into the
thicket as requested:-

1. Among many influences MacLow identifies   -  in Vort 8 (Stein,
Schwitters, Duchamp via Cage, Maciunas) 'equally important . . . were
Pound's use of economic, historical, and other text materials in 'The
Cantos'.' So, it's the choosing and the processing of materials under
compositional pressure which is particularly cogent to his earlier work
exploring the possibilities of 'chance'. Of course he doesn't always
compose using chance. In fact he has probably constructed chance-like
collocations into his overall linguistic desire to an extent sufficiently
influencing all of his writing  -  much as Burroughs' experiences with
cut-ups have altered his. (oooh oooh - these boiling waters here).

            I would agree with Herb about the idiosyncratic (subjective)
aspects of 'choosing one's ground' that mitigate against attributions of
'randomness' being used as a basis for criticism of chance-generated or
chance-impacted or chance-controlled works. (one thing I felt on Cage's
death was how utterly ludicrous the accusations were of his having denied
or erased individuality / subjectivity - levelled at him through banal
parrotic obituaries in the British press  - quite the opposite, his work
had tested the vacuousness of such a project and proved it false).

The careful choosing of ground is very important it would seem in
minimising the possibilities of generating meaning that one really! did not
'want'  -  I'm thinking here of conversations I've had, for example with
Allen Fisher, about the creation of unchallenged oppressive meanings and
whether MacLow ever edits / rejects or intervenes in his works on such
bases. In the Vort 8 issue he clearly says that some of his chance poems,
as well as intuitive ones, are 'revisable'. And I realise, Ira, that this
begins to touch onto your question of producing 'something more true, that
surprises and sobers her / him' - but with an extra twist. I've got to
agree with Sheila, from my own limited experience in chance-compositional
related matters, that the full range from mundane to utterly extraordinary
(in relation to primary expectation / intention) can and does become
present.

2. In conversation Jackson once gleefully told me of how his use of
frequent instructions to the performers regarding tone and attitude and so
on had enabled him to achieve 'indeterminacy through overdetermination'.
This is a strand that is of particular interest to me.
There might be some corrolation to be explored with composers of the 'new
complexity' such as Brian Ferneyhough.

3. Phrases that have come up in this discussion which I 'like' are Ryan's
'heightening of agency'  - Tony's 'purposive character' in relation to
positioning and Herb's question 'Can it be Random? which seems worth asking
once more before the onward wash of this list deletes it.

4. I would agree with John Cayley about the possibilities of composing
using chance in real time being comparatively under-explored. I would
certainly recommend John's hypertext book 'Unbound' in this respect. It's a
terrific piece of work that put simply writes (adds) the reader's reading
into itself as the reading progresses. And each reader can choose (opt for,
in a hands on response) to create a more or less collocational versioning
which is explored in dynamic tension alongside and inside the 'original'
linear texts. His composition makes chance generation from the materials he
provides available to every reader in a real time improvisatory engagement
through the act of reading. An extension of the opportunities offered by
every book? 'Unbound' is a fascinating multilogue, with the machine acting
as exquisite interpreter. Huh? I can't believe I just wrote that! So I'll
re-post John's own description:

>Processes can also be open-ended, feeding back into themselves. I have a
>new piece that learns phrases selected from generated text by the reader.
>The reader's copy of the piece is changed irreversibly by adding
>selections. Since the generative process is based on frequencies of
>collocations (word juxtapositions) the piece will eventually be dominated
>by phrases selected by the reader. (It would probably also eventually choke
>on the amount of text generated and selected. BTW this is probably also
>properly 'chaotic' -- literary turbulence slowly drawn towards a 'strange
>attractor', nudged into place by the reader.)

5. Ira, am I mis-reading you, deliberately? Isn't the often exhaustive
documentation of procedures presented alongside the poems (the results of
the implementation of the procedures) in MacLow's work in itself a research
write-up? What other format do you envisage such taking?

Hmmm....well there seems to be significant interest in this topic of
people who sit zazen and write poetry, or people who write poetry to
people who sit zazen and write poetry or....?   :)

I've been sitting zazen pretty seriously (i.e every day and some full day
and two or three day seshin once in a while) for about five years. I
would definietly say that it's 'influenced' my writing. I don't consider
myself a buddhist (in fact, some of why i sit is wrapped into the
question of 'what' i am...i think 'who' is irrelevent until the first one
is better explored). I think in general that zen is vastly misunderstood
(yes, even more than that) by those who do not practice it regularly (and
even by some who do!). Though it is clearly repeated that talking about
it is nearly useless, it is simultaneously true that human beings, being
talking machines, HAVE to talk about it (whoops! here I am!).

I feel personally that my spirituality, both within the zen paradigm and
without are a profound part of the reason, passion and form(s) of my
writing. These, coupled with my experiential explorations,
recollecctions, musings and emotings form the core of my inspiration and
content. Writing is a mystical act for me, it is an 'ordinary' opening
into the energetic realms of psyche and un/sub conscious mind, where the
separations fade to fog and then to a ringing silence! A silence which is
moving as though one had become the water in the river, without knowing
the concetps of water or river. (When it's at its best) Even when it (my
writing) is at its worst or most difficult, I recognize the symbolic
power of the act itself and take joy in my ability to join with the
poetic and prosaic elements of self and other.

Happy to answer other quries on this subject...

I haven't heard this piece, but if, as I assume, it's a musical piece for
dancers, there are a lot of composer choices of which sounds are heard by
movement in which sector of the grid.  Since at least most if not all of
the time, dancers will have to move through adjacent grid sectors, there
are quite strict constraints on the order of events.  These constraints
are further limited by Cage's choice of which sounds to trigger by light
beams in which sector.  Not knowing the piece, I don't know what sounds
were selected, but given these restraints this kind of technology could be
used to produce a fairly tonal, harmonically simple sounding work or an
extremely dissonant one.  Because of the kind of technology involved, it's
likely that this work was made in the sixties or late seventies, and given
Cage's history, it probably would have been <noisy> by the standards of
<normal> music.  But there's nothing in the formal structure that requires
it to be so.

In fact, tonal music is so strictly rule-based that it is relatively easy
to put together computer algorithms to create works within a particular
style.  As a parlor trick, Mozart once wrote a short piece for solo
keyboard in which the order of the measures was to be selected by throwing
dice.  The formal constraints of harmonic progressions are such that it
doesn't sound <random>, but, atleast on the level of movement from
measure to measure, it is exactly random.

In <Antic Quartrains>, Mac Low used a computer to somehow manipulate
anagrams on the letters of Anne Tardos' full name as derived in <A
Vocabulary for Annie Brigitte Gilles Tardos> (My copy of the text in
<Bloomsday> is not clear about how the words were selected or ordered.)
Isn't this a lipogram (an ancient form revived by various Oulipians,
in which a writer uses only words that do not contain one or more specific
leters) on those letters that are not found in Tardos' name?  While their
vocabulary is odd,to my ear each quartrain is a parseable sentence.  Mac
Low even uses a standard lipogrammatic ploy by several times replacing the
word <of> with the odd, but recognizable <o'>.

In other words, I just don't see Cage or Mac Low standing back from some
kind of run away train that happens to be spewing out words or sounds in
its wake.  What they are doing is exactly writing _with_ <anti-intention,
a work against the sprawl of ego> as you put it below in your description
of Ashbery or the Oulipo group.  And, in fact, Cage often described his
work in quite similar phrases.

I just don't see a clear place to draw the kind of distinction you want to
make.  I think it's just a continuum & not some formal opposition.

Dear Wystan...

and, as you say, everyone else who is listening.

I've never actually met another WS, though I know from turning the pages
of phonebooks, including NYs, that we are many. And I take it for granted,
as you do, that I'm not the only one of us who has a collection.  I do get
calls, from time to time, having to do with a somewhat different kind of
collection. There's at least one of us, WSs, out there somewhere who
doesn't pay his bills. I don't think I can be of any help to you, Wystan.
So far as I know you ARE the only living Wystan, Auden being dead, but I'm
quite sure others know better. Aren't you? I hestitated to mention
Stafford in my original post and I hestitate to mention Roethke in this
one but I am posting from Seattle. In "In a Dark Time" Roethke asks the
question:  "Which I is I?" That IS the question, isn't it? And, having
asked it, I'll return to my own sure silence. Bill.

Dear Kirby,
           Re-rhyme. Don't worry so. Look at Charles Bernstein, the one at
the net, always ready to serve poems which get from 'moon' to 'pantaloon' in
the space of a few words, and he's not the only one surely. The outlook for
rhyme seems very good to me right now. As to 'june' and 'croon'--don't write
them off. Someone will come along, singing

Subject:      aleatoric composition using chance

I've been away for a day, so want to say thank you to everyone who
responded to my floated questions. I got to read through the whole
discussion this morning, including seeing my own fresh - I kind of
didn't make clear that I do use aleatoric methods a lot myself,
and may have come across, in my politeness, as a bit more naif than
I am. But I'm really satisfied to see so much good introductory
discussion of chance, which I'm no good at providing myself.

John Cayley's right that I've seen his work. It's very lovely, using
interactiveness and hypertext, so that the lovely looking text slowly
materialises word by word on the screen, and as it does, one can
interact and make some choices to randomize it. Which is great, a
great use of a kind of chance, kind of "editing with chance", which
is a bit like what Cage does with source texts, as Herb pointed out.

The emphasis I'd like to add to this discussion, however, is less
about chance in the process of composition or editing/reading, and
more about chance in the process of personal growth as a person, in
the artist or reader, not necessarily both. Ashbery once said that
he finds his favourite, or most relevant, parts of books by opening
them at "random". I kind of want to talk about writing as horoscope,
maybe the artist does it cynically but it cues the reader, or maybe
the artist uses the process as a kind of personal horoscope and it also,
or instead, cues the reader.

Sheila E.Murphy said, among many other things:  "when trust supplies
the foundation for engagement with chance practices, miracles can happen.
The process seems to require a complete letting go to work as it can...
I'm most interested in chance practices because of what happens when
confidence and the wide open possibilites intersect."

Sheila, thanks for this, I agree that, as you really kindly put it, we are
"preaching different interests", but, still, thanks. I would draw some
attention, for my own purposes, to words that link to a dominant culture of
chance (that I don't want to lump you in) that I'm critical of, not because
I don't like it, but because *I* don't want to be subsumed into it or
confused with it (as you show, the best approach is for us all to see
we're preaching differently, but I don't always get this from other
chancers). The words I'd look at are "trust", "complete letting-go"
and "confidence". Of course, your (very seriously taken) phrase, "miracles
can happen" allows for so much room and open-mindedness that I think
I'm picking up on the phrasing, not the practice. But the issues I
want to raise here are: what is trust, does it involve trusting the process
to throw up only bearable miracles (what happens if it wants to say to
you "go onto the streets" or "murder the President" - and what if history
then showed that by murdering the President a whole awful world crisis
would have been avoided?); does complete letting-go involve suspending
emotional or intuitive response to the process as it is happening, even
if the best message or work might have been produced (people often hold
their breath when doing any kind of oracular work, does this equal the
biggest sin of all reading, waiting for the message and not observing
form, context and means of production?); is confidence intimacy, a
sense of invulnerability, or a sense of "this is a path, and I must
take it, and take the consequences" inspired courage?

I really clicked with what H. T. Kirby-Smith said about rhyme being an
aleatory process, and in fact I came to aleatory process as an inveterate
rhymer, hoping to find some of the same specific pleasure which, as Sheila
says, are not what most chancers are in it for. Thanks, H.T., for bringing
this in. It raises for me the possibility that one could produce a work
of art by aleatory means, and yet pass it off, and have it have the effect
of, intentional, ego-written, lyric. Which was what I was trying to say
about oracles, and perhaps the idea of the muse. It's like, sometimes when
I write a piece that is more written by the requirements of the form, I
wind up with a product that I think "that's what I was *trying* to say".
In such a procedure, I don't think of my conscious mind as something
narrow but as something a little bit blocked and needing unblocking.

This is kind of what Herb says about my description of Stockhausen's
use of chance: "I don't see how... (it's)... much different than the
way most artists have of trying stuff out and seeing if it works".
But I think my, and Stockhausen's, framing of this is oracular or
religious. Stockhausen, after all, believes he has been reincarnated
from an earlier life on the planet Sirius (if I could, I'd make a
Star Trek: The Next Generation episode where the Enterprise visits
Sirius and proves Stockhausen was telling the truth, since there are
so many episodes in that series that take alien infiltration very
seriously). Stockhausen has always talked of a higher calling, and
being the servant, or channel, of higher forces. I'm very interested
in this framing of chance. Whenever I've seen anyone do any oracle
consulting, or rune-casting (and I do it a lot myself, and get results
that have often been very powerful for me), you can see the ones who
don't do it with seriousness, and then they get jumbled results and
then pooh-pooh the whole discipline - and like all spirualists/psychics,
I would say that you get out what you put in. Where might Hannah
Weiner's clairvoyant word-seeing come into all this?

Herb, your defence of Cage is admirable, and interesting, but didn't he
sell himself, just a tad, on the guru aspect (like Pound with chinese
culture) of recommending the Buddhist way of life - and, as I said
before, we have been talking about Zen...

John Byrum interestingly says "all composition is to greater or
lesser degrees chance-generated", but perhaps what I've been arguing
is that all composition could also be said to be written as intentional
lyric - in that there's so much incidental daily detail in a lot of
lyric, so much extra randomness. John goes on to say "if one's sense
of self includes the world (self as an "expanded field" taking in
"everything"), these methods simply use other strategies, forces, or
parts of the world-self to formulate or generate the text". But I want
to ask a little bit about what is "self" and "text" in this formulation;
can they be active as well as passive, not simply being open-minded &
taking things in & seeing one's connection to the world, but *using* that
perspective - not just to recommend it to others, not all of whom may
be receptive, but to *act* on it, directing others if they won't direct
themselves. And similarly what is "text"? Is it to be perceived largely,
in all its connections,  as a formal metaphor to describe and convey
the world; or might it also be a flare intuitively put into the world by
the artist following a sense of higher calling, presenting to one or
many readers a fragment you didn't think you were offering, that has an
impact on destiny?

I'm thinking of these kinds of interaction between art (and prophecy
involves art) and the world. Do they interest anyone?

The second issue of Chain questions the supposed neutrality/objectivity of
documentary forms. The concerns of this issue are: in what ways does the
topical world filter through language? how do creative forms actually capture
an event, a person, a place? The work included highlights the way we use
language/image to cut up our experiential encounters so as to (re)see them.

Message mainly for Maria Damon. The writers of OuLiPo were and are
descendents of the great Raymond Roussel (also claimed by the
Surrealists as a source) who challenged one another to perform
literary acts of recombinant composition. You have perhaps heard of
Italo Svevo's _If on a Winter's Night a Traveller_. In recent times
it has been the most popularly successful OuLiPo work. I reccomend
the feat of Georges Perec, who wrote an entire novel without using
the letter e. It has recently been published in English, if you
prefer that, in the U.S. A. Other prominent OuLiPo writers are
Raymond Queneau and Harry Mathews. There has always been an
association between poets of the New York so called school and the
OuLiPo guys. Some of this association you can find in your old copies
of _Locus Solus_, which was itself named after a great OuLiPo work.

errata corrige: italo calvino -not svevo- wrote _if on a winter night...._

calvino, by the way, was friend of perec and queneau and translator of both.

queneau's writings -like calvino's- stand at the convergence of the oulipo

poetics and a variety of playfully engaged meta-reflective narrative that

looks back at voltaire's and diderot's productions  -- good euroreadings

if anyone is interested (but not svevo -that is altogether something else)

When Kit and I spoke with Zhung Zhiqing last year, he identified a
practice that is common in the People's Republic among the
intelligentsia. The practice is called chi kung, which roughly
translates into "breathing practice," and amounts to a completely
secularized version of sitting zazen. It's so common that it does not
distinguish the zen poets, for example, from the "language" ones there.

In part trying out a new program for e-mail and more, in part thinking
about the conversations on aleatory composition, in part wanting more poems
on this forum, here:


This is the year 1997 and there
are gale winds in the west, never
a note played in discontent and

in a place where animals play
the imagined margins soar with letters
flung at odd intervals and ink
spills a clear running relevance
moved to safer particles, absolved.

These are the words the heart makes
forgetting its injunction to exercise
while floating, fingers succumb to
the temptation to imply themselves
or another, waiting, presumptive.

Do not argue, I want to say, there
is not enough time, I don't even know
what thought might bring the third day
and something beats now, wanting
only to be subject, object too, yours.

What will the hospital say, the treadmill,
another language of not knowing, as if
anything else were possible, today or
another time, invisible, flags from porches
forego the year, the skin, the tissue.
We are flying on the ground.

I wonder what birds sing at yr bedroom window

All night my bed is borne by six faggots in ties & tails
Baron de Charlus among them
              all night long
they jog along to receding cemeteries
swaddled in mist, where disillusioned cows
browse out the summer,
             when the morning comes
it takes a while to relocate the sun
which in fact is, or shd be,

in the vicinity of my navel wells a strawberry cake
I am pregnant with pink icing

Subject:      aleatory poetry

Another good example of disruptive limitation or randomnizing is what
Marianne Moore did with syllabics. It was wonderfully absurd--making
poems in which every single stanza had lines with exactly the same
pattern --the same number of syllables for each corresponding line,
such as 13, 23,11,9,9,22. I just made that up but look at "The
Monkeys" or many another of hers. There is no way to know what the
pattern is other than counting on your fingers. But for her it
provided a dislocative framework that compelled unusual choices.

Dylan Thomas --I couldn't believe this when I first heard it-- did
the same thing for most of the lines in each stanza of "Fern Hill."
Even nuttier, the first poem in his COLLECTED POEMS has a pattern
whereby the last line rhymes with the first, second with
sceond-to-last, on in to the middle of the approx 50-line poem where
there is a couplet. He worked very hard at it and someone told me he
was hurt when nobody noticed what he had done.

But as for rhyme, probably everyone should quit using it for five
hundred years and then take it up again. It was a silly accident to
start with. The Norman Conquest caused rhyme. All that's needed to
explain that is a 500-page fotnote.

But here is a rhyme for Marisa, who probably already knows it--it was
Theodore Roethke's favorite, I think--

Hinx
Minx
The Old Witch Winks
The fat begins to fry.

Subject:      Re: Aleatory Poetry

George Bowering refers to...

"your old copies of _Locus Solus_, which was itself named after a great
OuLiPo work"

... which may be a little misleading to some. _Locus Solus_ is a novel
by the aforementioned Raymond Roussel, a guide to the estate and
collections of the novel's main character (whose name escapes me
just now).

Roussel's compositional methods, wonderfully curious, are described
in his "How I Wrote Certain of My Works" -- fairly easily available,
but I can't tell you where as I write.

Perhaps, also, it is a little misleading too to think of OuLiPo as
coming out of Roussel exclusively, as the group is devoted to an open set of
procedural writing techniques whose forebears are equally to be sought
in late Latin pattern poetry as well as in mathematical modeling in all
fields. Jacques Rouboud, one of the leading Oulipiens, is a prof. of
math for example.

The very great writer Georges Perec (whom I had the good luck to meet
in Paris when I lived there more than twenty yrs ago) was an early
member of OuLiPo and recruited Harry Mathews, but I think the group
was founded by Raymond Queneau (?)

For those who don't know Perec's work, the novel without "e" is
called La Disparution (translated as Avoid), and there is also one
written using e as the only vowel. Surely his greatest work, and
one of the most amazing works of writing I've ever encountered,
is "La vie, mode d'emploi," translated as "Life, A User's Manual."
I would also recommend "W, or Memories of Childhood" and "A Man
Asleep" -- indeed just about anything he wrote.

Perec died in 1982 (of lung cancer, aged 46). Harry Mathews wrote
a wonderful memoir of his friend, but - continuing the bibliographic
bibliogaffes of this post - I can't remember the title and can't find
the book on my shelves. Continuing interest will prompt a more thorough
search (wearing my glasses for example).

thanks george: it turns out i've read most of the works you mention, including
perec's la disparition, which i came across in paris in 1973 or 4 when i was
fresh out of high school, but i didn't know until now that they constituted a
"school" with a name.  just goes to show, when yr young and just folowing your
literary instincts, how much intellectual capital you can miss out on!  like,
also, that year, i took classes from a guy who went religiously to lacan's
weekly lectures and passed the info on to us --we read ecrits etc., but i never
knew the word "lacanian" until i got to grad school some 8 yrs later, where it
turned out that not only was there a whole apparatus of prestige set up around
using the word "lacanian" --but what my colleagues were talking about and
attributing to lacan had so little in common with what i thot i'd read and heard
that if not for the name and the book titles, i would never have guessed it was
the same guy.  now tht i'm a jaded academic, i wish i had some of that innocent
fresh take on ideas texts and language back!--again, thanks for the info, and
just a friendly reminder to one and all myself most of all, "un coup de des n'a
jamais aboli le hasard."

by the way, what does OuLiPo stand for?  when it's written thus, it has the air
of an anagram of sorts.--md

Subject:      Roubaud /  brief introduction

Katheryn McDonald

Translator's Introduction  (ROUB04.01 /RIFT04.01 (c) 1995)


     Jacques Roubaud's poetry moves in two directions at once.  It is
resolutely complicated, structured by mathematical symbols and
many-optioned choices.  This  is poetry that draws attention to itself as
language, offering the reader the opportunity to move blocks of it around,
structure a book as she pleases.  The re-combinatory, repetitive conception
of poetry-as-words contrasts with the alternative, also present in
Roubaud's work, of a healing poetry, expressive of grief or joy.  The dual
aspect that characterizes Roubaud's poetry is in place from his first
published book of poems, _E_, which appeared at Gallimard in 1967.  This
volume presents itself in a dry and very formal manner, presaged by the
mathematical symbol that serves as the book's title.  The poems themselves
are at the intersection of several formal constraints: the movement of
white and black markers in a game of *go*; the structure of a sonnet of
sonnets; finally the order imposed by the poems' physical presence in a
book of poetry.  The possibilty of re-ordering the poems of _E_--presented
as an integral part of the work--presumes the idea of these poems as a sort
of game.  Their configuration can be changed, indeed is constructed around
the possibility of change, according to previously delineated rules.  It is
these rules that open the book, under the heading "mode d'emploi de ce
livre."  But across these poems, divided into paragraphs marked by
mathematical symbols, seemingly simply the markers in a complex and formal
game, we hear a very personal cry of loss at the death of a brother, and
the troubled search of a poet coming to terms with the place of poetry in
relation to his own life.


     Jacques Roubaud sets up the parameters of his search in the first
complete movement of _E_, which is the first sonnet of sonnets.  His
"conclusion" is a departure for the rest of the book.  Although each poem
can stand alone, the sonnet can also be read as a suite.  The reader can
follow the movement of thought that unfolds as the poet moves from
rejection of the outside world through an interrogation of language,
concluding with an acceptance of that world through the medium of his own
past.

Jacques Roubaud and Georges Perec, under a single pseudonym,
published an introduction to the game Go in the sixties (?).

Roubaud's "Some Thing Black," a very beautiful book, is
available from Dalkey Archive, as is his "The Great Fire of
London," a long novel.

Harry Mathews memoir of Georges Perec is called "Le Verger" (The
Orchard). Written in French it was translated by the author and
I remember having seen the translated edition -- but where?

The memoir is written in a form inaugurated (to my knowledge)
by the late Joe Brainard; discrete paragraphs each begin "I
remember." Perec had read Brainard's work of that title and
loved it and wrote a work himself in the same way. Harry
Mathews memoir is well worth reading even for those who
don't know Perec's work or his; it is a moving indication
and example of friendship.

Bravo Charles! It looked like this was turning into a poetics forum without
poetry. Your poem engaged my brain and senses, and above all, it's _memorable_.
If a text is a picnic where the author brings the words and the reader brings
the sense (Todorov?) then the words have to be tasty enough to make the reader
*want* to come to the picnic. Too many "open" works turn up with a tossed
salad of withered celery, stale croutons, mouldy turnips and week-old brussels
sprouts. You brought smoked salmon and a bottle of Kumeu River Chardonnay -
thank you.

On another subject, there's a couple of Canadian sound poets giving a reading
here next week: Douglas Barber and Stephen Scobie. Is anyone on the list
familiar with their work? I haven't experienced much sound poetry (does this
mean that everything else is _un_sound poetry?) apart from Edwin Morgan ('The
Loch Ness monster's song' etc), so I'm intrigued, but I wonder whether anyone
has any opinions on these particular poets.

Thanks,

        Tom Beard.

Maria -- I'm running late & see that your questions has already been
answered -- but thought you would like to know that there was an English
language Oilipo anthology pubd. in "86 by U of Neb. Press -- Titled
_Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature_, edited by Warren F. Motte.
It's in many libraries, but has also been remaindered & is thus available
CHEAP!  There was also a special Oulipo issue of some arts mag. last year
edited by Harry Matthews, I think the only American member of Oulipo, the
title of which I can't remember -- but when I get back to my office next
week I'll post the info. to you

& for the Jazz fans -- I've always heard an "accidental" echo in Roland
Kirk's "Theme for the Eulipians" -- listen to it and think of this note
by Perec:

A considerably diminshed echo of these vertiginous preoccupations seems
to me to resound still in the case of the lipogram.


Somebody once threatened to give me at fat oulipo.

I don't htink rhyme is a simple, ugly or simply ugly issue at all.
What about Levertov's various kinds of rhymes and rhyming.  I n
one essay she explains how rhyme chime and echo are the signatures
of the mind's return, the ceaseless movements of perception which
are invariably "intently haphazard".  Perhaps the typical end
rhyme is a dead issue, but i think, as in Levertov, its face and
function is evolving.

Wystan--my sympathies, but you did have W(ystan) H. Auden for namesake once
upon a time. You do prompt me to wonder what names have to do with our perspect
ival inclinations. I mean, do the Mary Jones and Bill Smiths of the world feel
a deep intuitive solidarity with those around them, their own names mirrored
back with some regularity? Or is it the pinch of the uncanny? I can only
wonder, as I know literally all the people in the world named Rasula (less than
a dozen), because the name comes from a few mailboxes on a dirt road in central
Finland, a place name adapted by ancestor immigrants because they took it (righ
tly) that it would be less mangled in pronunciation than the patronymic, which
was Jaskari. Not that being named Jed is any less singular, although I have met
a few--most recently in Seville last summer, of all places.

Maria-- to adjust George Bowering's note on OuLiPo slightly, that's Italo
Calvino, not Joyce's buddy Italo Svevo.
                                        There's a handy collection of Oulipian
manifestos edited and translated by Warren Motte, published by U.Nebraska about
6 or 8 years ago, if you're interested.

Yikes, did I write Italo Svevo? I dont think that Svevo made many
joues at all, though he was an interesting man. I mean how many other
writers have a bookstore named after them, I mean a bookstore that
uses up a city block? Calvino, exactly. I think that his most amazing
project was _The Path of Crossed Destinies_ if that's what it is in
English.

If I remember correctly, the Mathews text _The Orchard_ was published
by Bamberger Books. I'm sort of 67% sure.

I published 2 years ago a memoir done in the same fashion for the
great painter Greg Curnoe, killed on his bicycle. Called it _The
Moustache_, made proper homage to Mathews, Perec and Brainard.

It would seem to me that it is impossible not to use rime in poetry,
although I have heard some dreadful stuff and seen some dreadfgul
stuff in magazines that seems to give it a try. Hell, I bet someobody
with a good ear could even do interesting stuff with rime at the ends
of lines.

Tom Mandel is certainly right in his praise of Perec. I have some
friends at University of Queensland, and they apparently did not see
him when he was there for a little while.

By the way, the name of the guy who owns the estate in Roussel's
_Locus Solus_ is Martial Canterel, I think. I am not sure that we can
call it a novel, but what the hell, why dont we?

Regarding the rhyme thread:

KEEPING THE RHYME

By stress and syllable
by change-rhyme and contour
we let the long line pace even awkward to its period.

The short line
we refine
and keep for candor.

This we remember:
ember of the fire
catches the word if we but hear
    ("We must understand what is happening")
and springs to desire,
a bird-right light
    sound.

This is the Yule-log that warms December.
This is new grass that springs from the ground.

As to the impossibility of writing poetry without rhyme, well there
was this fellow named Bill Williams and this guy named Olson and then
there was someone a while back who wrote an epic poem--Homer, Milton,
Vergil--that didn't have any rhyme--as a matter of fact Milton called
it this "troublesome bandage [sic]"--and then there was a long time
back Horace and Sappho and then there was a whole lot of people who
wrote plays in blank verse and I don't remember seeing a rhyme in
Ginsberg but who knows what he is capable of?

Subject:      chance / trust

Hi,

Some of the Vocabulary being used for this subject is in danger of becoming
conflated into dangerous goo:

Religious / Miracles / Trust / Oracular /  Horoscope  /  Reincarnated /
Consulting / Prophecy and such are being inveigled into these discussions
and I want to know more about what they mean to differing people. I'm going
to need convincing that such terms can be useful tools of communication
either today or tomorrow. Don't they convey an overbearing excess baggage?

I'm not at all suggesting that certain words can't be used. Just that it
might be more user-friendly to adopt or co-opt other words through which to
discuss what they are being used to signify - rather than clogging the
discussion with ballast which is vague unless clarified at some
considerable length.

Many such terms invoke a 'higher' sense or power. This immediately opens a
huge and prickly discussion. 'Higher' than what - 'higher' than whom? Let's
get particular here please. I'd be just as worried by anyone using chance
methods in the understanding that by so doing they can by-pass or somehow
circumnavigate subjectivity (taking what's been said about curbing the
sprawl of the ego into account here) as by the assertion that one accept
'fate' as dictated by a horoscope constructed by rote to the extensive
purposes of political manipulation as documented in 'Religion and the
Decline of Magic' by Keith Thomas (an important book on the subject from
the viewpoint of 16th and 17th century england - wicca, astrology,
Protestant rationality and Magiq from which, opening that book at 'random'
i quote 'the medieval church thus did a great deal to weaken the
fundamental distinction between a prayer and a charm, and to encourage the
idea that there was virtue in the mere repetition of holy words' or 'the
very impenetrability of the formaula helped to give it its power').

There is also a tremendous difference between a 'conscious' exploration and
the unquestioning acceptance of either a doctrine or of a meaning generated
by a system whose pre-determined fashionings are taken at the simplistic
face value of being defended as necessary merely because they validate the
integrity of the method. In other words it is equally reprehensible to
invoke chance or trance as an excuse. Perhaps an incisive discussion could
be revealed by paraphrasing Jackson Pollock 'mistakes don't exist'. What do
you feel about that?

In these meanings there is a difference as you pointed out between the
secular and the 'other' 'wise'.

How about

prescience / consciousness / attention / interference / energies /
transferral / occurence / attenuation / exquisition

love, truth and beauty

Amidst the flurry of postings about who the Oulipians were, Ira Lightman's
response Friday to the aleatory/chance thread he'd started a day or two
before, seems to have been ignored.

Or maybe I'm the only one who has trouble with Ira's posting.  Let's
see.  If this seems like it's heading too far into the music &
isn't of interest to folks here, please let me know.

Ira, as I read your posts on this topic, you have some difficulties with
Cage's use of chance and have posited Stockhausen's use of chance as a
model that, in your eyes, is somehow more effective.  To help me see the
distinction you are drawing here, could you please give a specific example
of what you see as Stockhausen's use of chance, so we can discuss how the
two differ.

I'm not exactly sure what your issues with Cage are, though you clearly
have some concern about his commitment to Buddhism.  But in your posting
you describe some aspects of Stockhausen's spirituality in detail and then
dismiss Cage's as selling

> himself, just a tad, on the guru aspect (like Pound with chinese
> culture) of recommending the Buddhist way of life.

This is hardly a fair way to compare the two, especially given
Stockhausen's own efforts to proselytize both musically and spiritually,
so again, could you please give some specific examples so we can discuss
how the two differ.

My concern is that very few people on <poetics> seem to have any sense of
Stockhausen's work at all, and most people, even the erudite folks here,
have little more than the odd received mis-information about Cage's work.

Without getting a clarification of what you mean in your characterizations
of both artists, I don't see much here besides the fact that you clearly
respond more favorably to Stockhausen's work than to Cage's.

I'd like to know more.  When I want to compare top ten lists, I read
<rec.music.classical>.  I look forward to a deeper discussion here.

But I did also want to mention that David Bellos, who has translated most

Dear George -

I'm sorry to hear of the closure of Black Swan, though it had changed
quite a bit over the years, there were still things there which I couldn't
find elsewhere.  In fact, I think I got my LP of Bunting reading
<Briggflats> there.

Ah, well, there's already been much talk about the lamented demise of
various book stores on <poetics>, do we now begin elegies for records shop
closings as well?

Anyway, this is the time of year when it's hard to get through to Ken
Pickering,'cause of planning for the DuMaurier Festival.  I called him
a week or so after your posting about the Aylers (about something else,
actually) & haven't heard back yet.

I will see him when I'm in Vancouver for BlaserFest '95, though. I look
forward to meeting you then as well.

Of course, that last <you> is a shifter including everyone reading this
message on <poetics>.

shaman, but what does he mean: "... the labyrinth beyond time and space,
seeks his way out to a clearing." ???

i'm starting to think about this sentence in relation to benjamin's essay
"the destructive character," i think, primarily because of my focus on the
word: "clearing."

i'd appreciate any insights you may have.

thanks for this,

Dear H.T.,
        As to the fellow, he rhymes like this:
               In houses
               the priceless dry rooms
               of illicit love
               where we live
               hear the wash of the
                                  rain--

               There
                     paintings

               and fine

                     metalware
               woven stuffs--
               all the whorishness
               of our

                    delight

               sees
               from its window

               the spring wash
               of your love

                           the falling

               rain--


and as for your guy,he rhymes like this:

             I, MAXIMUS OF GOUCESTER, TO YOU

             Off-shore, by islands, hidden in the blood
             jewels & miracles, I , Maximus
             a metal hot from boiling water, tell you
             what is a lance, who obeys the figures of
             the present dance

etc., etc. But this you know already?? if you say this ain't rhyme, what
you're really mean is it aint in regular metre. Rhyme is actually one of the
conventions of 'free verse', so what might might be of interest then are the
rules of its distribution. Back to you.

Subject:      chance / choice spaces

re Jackson Mac Low:

Jackson once told me (perhaps this is common knowledge) that he started using
chance operations because he was concerned that his writing had become too
sentimental.  He stopped using chance operations -- because he found the
writing too sentimental!

re Cage:

The thing that has always blown my mind about John Cage is that back in the
'30s -- long before the technology of electronic music existed -- he
understood that it was coming, that technology would exist that would allow
any sound theoretically possible to actually be heard, and thus needed a
basis for composing music based on the geometry of sound itself.  Before
Cage, composing music meant creating instructions either for the singing
human voice or for manipulating a particular (read ideosyncratic to each
particular culture) set of historical artifacts known as musical instruments.
Cage enumerated the dimensions of sound:  pitch, timbre, loudness, duration,
morphology (more typically called envelope these days, I think).  His
confrontation with the world of sound was whole, was total, was so completely
central that this "acoustical" point of view has influenced hundreds of
composers who might deny vehemently any aesthetic connection with Cage.

Chance is a mechanism for providing answers; the composer provides the
questions.  Cage would constantly explore to find the geometry of the *choice
space* to know how to forumulate these questions.  (It is one of the many
paradoxes of work with chance operations that chance is a more effective
method of filling a choice space than choice ...)  E.g. he would constantly
go to musicians and ask them to show him the whole range of everything they
could do with their instrument -- working out the dimensions of that
musician's practice.

What are the dimensions of the choice space of language?  Of language itself?
John's mesostics leave this as a question not really undertaken.  The very
word 'dimension' sounds odd with respect to language.  What do we do with
syntax?  How many dimensions are there to syntax?  The question sounds very
odd.  Yet *dimension* is exactly the kind of thing you seek in doing chance
operations:  the scale against which to apply the random number.  In fact,
Cage's mesostics did not apply operations to language, but to *text*.  In the
face of an intractable choice space one retreats to a much more tractable
space, the space of text *finding* operations.  It gave me no pleasure at all
when I was told that John used one of the programs I wrote for him every day
-- for years on end -- instead it leaves me with a haunted sense of unease.
What would we think of John Cage as a composer if he had written no other
music than the pieces for radios?  Had stuck to the exact identical method
making pieces for radios for years at a time?

So we are back to the question:  what is the geometry of the choice space of
*language* -- the total space of all conceivable circumstances of language,
text or no text.  I don't have an answer, would never claim to have even
*started* on an answer.

Subject:      Re: Aleatoric Spree

Responding to a couple of points recently made in the general subject area
of aleatoric procedures:

Since someone's referenced the comparison between Stockhausen and Cage, I'd
have to say that, on reflection, the pairing of these individuals seems
unlikely, perhaps a chance occurrence in itself.

Initially positioned as a departure from tradition, 12-tone music easily
evolved into an alternative classical system of its own.  In spite of its
detractors (seems that every gesture needs to spawn some little mosquito of
a battle), 12-tone music gathered clout, probably because of its packaging
and therefore susceptibility to surface understanding.

As a part of studies in music theory and composition, we were assigned to
create in this vein, and I remember fondly the making of charts, and the
kinds of discoveries they helped spawn.  These later factored into some of
my chance procedures in writing, providing ways to turn out equivalent
disposable containers (as distinct from focusing on more traditional foundry).

I think it was Chris who suggested that a scope (or an ear trumpet?) might
be applied to the squishy vocabulary that has slithered out of this
discussion.  Having been responsible for some of the language, I'll just say
that the concern with it represents a fair call.

The only thing in response might be this:  I don't look upon chance
procedures as the components of a religion.  The process and the results are
engaging and stimulating enough to warrant some excitement, I think. But in
a bigger picture, I believe there is a spectrum that runs from expectation
and surprise, with chance as one form of expression representing heavily the
surprise side.  Compositional methods and procedures comprise the respected
instrument, or an extension of whatever instrument we might construe for
making.  The "woo woo" factor is not a stopping place, but is hard to ignore
sometimes.

The more one makes a place for chance occurrences in one's writing, the less
of a fuss needs to be made about it.  I know I'm not unique in doing this
without announcement.  While some works wind up being named after their
progenitor (the method), many just slip by and arrive wearing other
nomenclature.  It just depends upon the sort of birth announcement that
seems warranted.

I don't mean to denigrate any focus on this subject, because it represents a
stimulating aspect of writing.  But, finally, the process can't be islanded
off on its own and looked at independent of the creative process.  That
would mean a partial view of the actual process.

   I'm wondering if there is a certain "unwritten law" of an "interpretative
   community" informing the discussion on aleatory music and conferring on it
   a certain legitimacy denied to more lyrically based forms such as punk
   and rap and grunge and blues and 60's rock...Because to talk about rock
   it seems to talk about "hybrids" that isn't as sophisticated lyrically as
   poetry nor is as sophisticated musically as Stockhausen etc. and thus is
   low culture and worse, it SELLS! (and either there is envy or contempt of
   such)...and if we put poetry in dialogue with rock lyrics surely poetry
   can not be said to aspire to "THAT KIND OF MUSIC"....movies, theatre,
   theory, painting....of the "sister arts" to poetry rock music ain't one
   of them.....
   I saw Joan Retallack read the other day she said that Emerson gave her
   an early authoritative defense of "inconsistency"---
   And then there was an accessibility panel and I asked Bill Luoma if
   he considered "angst" more "accessible" than "flippancy"....and he said
   "angst, unless you are....."(he named someone here from the New York
   scene, it doesn't matter who. The point is he gave a quick answer.)

a unitary astro-church producing one horoscope which clearly I would be
an idiot to read as if it linked me with all Aries - no, it makes a
range of magazines, and I might find a Daily Mail, or a Times, or a
Cosmopolitan, in a train carriage or the street or a friend's or a
rival's house, and *that* issue's horoscope in *that* magazine that I
don't normally read might be instructive on *that* day. (As it is, I
also find that the Aries horoscope in the Pink Paper, the free lesbigay
weekly, is pretty reliably right about my life).
        Plus one can hardly say that a horoscope one has generated for
oneself by chance methods (eg my favourite game is picking a book off the
shelves, a page number, a line number, then a sequence of numbers - eg, 2,
5, 1, 8 - and writing down the 2nd then 5th then 1st then 8th word on that
chosen line, and seeing what message you get - I did my procedure on Charles'
poem >thanks for the thanks, Charles< by noting swiftly that his poem had
100 to 150 words and then switching to a blank screen and writing a poem
of numbers in that range, then going back and substituting each number for
the word at that point in Charles' poem - I'll post my working papers in a
minute - then trying to edit the result, goofing up and producing, by
chance interaction with the machine, the poem I sent to the list)
has been imposed by a
totalising state or religion. You can say that I am acting as if I wanted
to be subject to a regime that took away my decision-making will and let
me off responsibility for my fate, but it aint that way for me - I often
bicker with most new Age people and astrologers, because, in fact, they
prove to have very fixed beliefs about how one should act and use chance
methods to come to what they probably would have advised you or themselves
anyway - advice which may well, as Cris indicates, partake of suspicious
"higher" agendas, like "love money", "put your family ahead of society",
or "I recommend you sign up for a course of twenty sessions with my friend
the expensive Shaitsu counsellor, and don't forget to remind him about my
cut... I mean, to tell him I sent you". But so do many people have such
higher agendas, based on complicity with bullying power blocks/capitalism/
anti-intellectualism/anti-emotionalism - that isn't an issue of figuring
chance as a divining instrument, not part of the language or logic. There
are plenty of groups that use words like

"prescience / consciousness / attention / interference / energies /
transferral / occurence / attenuation / exquisition"

and fuck you over, bully you, want you to join their church; sometimes,
in the context where such "hypocrisy" (if one links language with behaviour)
operates behind the nice words, it is an act of dissent, not high church,
to use words with a religious "history", to keep things unorthodox thus
creative

truth is beauty is easily reordered

Subject:      rhyme

It is helpful if one wants to chime in about rhyme to take time to
watch out for what it isn't. For example, "live" and "love" echo one
another but what you have is consonance, not rhyme. Rhyme has to do
with vowel sounds being the same or losely similar, followed by one
identical consonant sound. Beyond that are all the degrees of slant
rhyme, quasi-rhyme, and assonance. Some of the most remarkable
inventions along this line are in Sylvia Plath's pre-Daddy poems,
written about 1956-1958. I don't think I have ever in my life used
the word "Protean" before but that describes rhyme to me.

Edmund Wilson onece made up something called "reverse rhyme"--i.e. in
one line you ended with "grab" and the next with "brag" or "barge"--I
think. It made no sense at all but did sound pretty funny.

Since there are only a limited number of combinations of sounds in
any given language there are always going to be rhyming words. To
point out accidental, or even semi-intentional echoing is like
pointing out the dandelions in a lawn. Yeah, they are there all
right and they look pretty. But they planted themselves.

Subject:      Williams poem

Just wanted to acknowledge seriously my gratitude to Wystan for
putting on the Williams poem. I don't know why it wasn't one of my
favorites before but it is now. You know, Williams was enormously
admiring of Keats when he was a teenager and his earliest poems were
Keats imitations. In this poem I think that we see a progression of
interwoven sounds much like Keats at his best--the Keats of "To
Autumn." Both H.D. and Williams, it seems to me, took things that had
been ancillary to Romantic poetry and extrinsic ornament in some
Victorian poetry, and made them organically functional in their own
poems. It doesn't seem to me there are any rules for what they did;
but I do think that we can look at what they did and arrive at a
consensus, or at least a set of overlapping perceptions, as to what
they did.

Subject:      Re: Aleatoric Spree

I sent a run of messages this morning, then got more to respond to afterwards,
so sorry for sending this one too:

I want to respond to Chris Stroffolino, and Sheila and Herb - like all of
you, I don't want to bash any kind of music, or just state idle preferences.
Like you say, Herb, so many say things about Cage who don't seem to know
the music but, rather, the seemingly graspable aesthetic theory. And like
you say, Chris, there's a lot of snobbery vs punk, pop, amplified guitars
etc. And like you say, Sheila, the twelve tone system can just solidify
into another classicism (though will it survive as such, is this a kind
of sulky - bad for them - intransigence?).

All I want to do is quiz some of the oppositions that underlie loyalty
to *one* kind of music at the expense of all others, not keep saying
"Stockhausen" over & over till everyone listens to him or ignores me.
One of my first posts to the list, Herb, was to say like you that Cage
is too readily appropriated, and seems to stand for some very narrow-minded
avant-garde approaches to music in non-musicians; or, in other words,
if a poet doesn't want to put in the hard work involved taking music
seriously, he/she can say "I like Cage" and thus, in one foul swoop,
justify never wanting to listen to pre-Cage classical music or any
New Music done by those who differ from Cage eg (for my tastes) Boulez
and Stockhausen AND (in the same swoop) seem to be into avant-garde music
by being a fan of John Cage. Let me rush to say that this formulation
does not apply, in the slightest, to you Herb, or any of the others who
have posted about Cage on this list in this discussion, there's been some
wonderful discussions of sound and texture, which are issues for pets
(poets?) too.

I guess it's like the discussion on rhyme too, in that I don't believe
one strikes a blow against the establishment by being anti-rhyme (ie
consciously teasing a reader who wants rhyme) or "anti-classical",
since there's a hugely dominant hatred of most classical music by
people afraid to engage with it, so it seems to me, except via a few
of the greatest hits (in this case, Chris S., I would worry about
popularity, not that one thing is popular but that it is used in an
Eighties way, to justify streamlining out more marginal things, and
there is this love of say melody that inspires lazy record producers
to ignore soundscape, bass, and polyphony in order to produce a sound]
Beavis and Butthead can headbang too - though I think Beavis and
Butthead are cool). So it doesn't worry me that twelve tone music
might get classical, except in so far as you get music that suits the
intellectual rules of musicologists and don't move me or nuthin'.

Chris S, me, I like Alternative Television, Boulez's settings of Rene
Char, Bjork, Sleeper, Mo Tucker's first solo album, Stockhausen's
Samstag. I really like silence and I really like noise. Some people
really like delicacy and are dillweeds about noise; some people love
noise and can't cope with lack of a beat or oddity or silence. I'm
not anti punk, but I am anti anything that thinks it's outdated
everything previous when all that means is you can't be a fan and
also listen to anything previous; I also think this society of mine
lacks for nothing punk, rude, harsh, anti-bourgeois, yet lacks all
the time in gentleness, open ears, complex thinking; so, at the moment,
I turn to classical music to be challenged by the way it's complex,
intense, yet grounded in the ability to be still - then I might make
art that is nothing like classical music, but still has these things,
which this society of mine lacks. Oh, and I write in a guitar band that
uses rhythm (even if it is sometimes 7/8) and limited chords (even if
some do come from Stravinksy), and lyrics out of Language Poetry but
also Liz Phair. And I try to be open to what others are doing, and
encourage those who cross the boundaries as I describe them, cos I
never felt that much encouragement or recognition of my attempts by
anyone older than me.

I think Pound was right that poetry mustn't stray too long from
music(s); if the poet only buys into one music, especially one that
sells itself as superceding all others, things ossify quickly,

Ira


p.s. anyone who doesn't want to read Herb and me talking about Cage
and Stockhausen should leave this message here...

Herb, I agree with you that Stockhausen proslytises too, I was
only making that jibe in response to your earlier message suggesting
one might think of Cage's use of the I-Ching just in terms of numberm]
, and it wouldn't be such an issue then; and I was just responding that
(since I think Cage *does* use the I-Ching mostly as a number system)
that the question remained of being a bit of a guru and yet not
being part of a complex sacral system, but in fact an easily grasped
rite in isolation. I don't mind Stockhausen being a guru, because I
think he's very serious about setting up a complex sacral system that'
one cannot grasp quickly or easily.

Anyway, fulfilling your kind request, here's some specific examples
of Stockhausen's aleatoric work:

Discussion of Klavierstuck XI, from Stcokhausen, by Michael Kurtz,
trans Richard Toop, Faber, London, 1992:

"Nineteen groups of notes - all derived from the same basic principles,
whereby the pitches and the rhythmic structures are interrelated - are
distributed irregularly over a sheet of paper measuring 53 by 93
centimetres. The pianist is to look 'without prior intent' at the
sheet of paper, and begin with whatever group his or her eye happens
to light on first. Tempo, dynamics and mode of attack are free. At
the end of each group is a tempo indication, a dynamic level and a
mode of attack, all determining the way the next group (again, selected
by a random glance) is to be played." (pp 86-87)

Stockhausen interviewed in "Towards a Cosmic Music", Element Books,
Shaftesbury, Dorset, England, 1989:

"We know from tradition that composers' moments of intuitive
inspiration have constantly been seen as decisive. Viewed intellectually,
that is 'indeterminacy' in terms of tradition. From the standpoint
of intuition, however, which is also a human experience albeit little
utilised today, the outcome involves a highly specific 'determined'
music."

(my commentary - I love this, it looks like paradox, but it is a way
of saying that one movement often begins with pseudo-explanations
of what it is doing, simply in order to get the new vibe out
there, to get people to engage with the art, take it seriously,
feels its shape and texture and resonances - sometimes you even
need to kid *yourself* you have (intellectual) "reasons", when
you are simply letting historical change occur through your ministry;
like all those sci-fi time-travel films where we share in the sense
of the good guys forcing a crucial historical event which we know
in the future went really well - "Backbeat", the film about the
Beatles, for example)

"For the moment there are only very few such musicians, completely
dedicated to their work which they don't just see as a job - musicians
of extremely great sensitivity ready to follow intuitive inspiration.
They must also carry out specific preparatory spiritual exercises
before they play. Their entire way of life must be dedicated to this
kind of intuitive music. They can't drink a beer and then start playing
five minutes later, unaware of their responsibility"

(This interests me, especially the not drinking beer, where I *agree*
with Cage on the value of macrobiotics and care over one's intake and
what specific foods *do* to one's state; I'd cross-reference this with
the point that this doesn't have to mean "don't listen to other
music" as the composer himself wrote a piece sampling national anthems
and letting them interact with each other)

"my music is absolutely dependent on intuitive players capable of
working in a group...a traditional string quartet doesn't offer any
comparison since it plays rationally determined music... in free
Jazz and in other traditions, such as Indian music, there are,
however, always rules, schemata, etc., providing a framework for
'improvisation'. A group of musicians playing *purely intuitively*
is an innovation in *all* traditions."

(Cris Cheek has said this before on this list about much improv)

"In my Aus Den Sieben Tagen pieces, the musicians sometimes play
for forty minutes on the basis of two or three sentences. The
music provides spiritual orientation derived from the text. The
players are much more relaxed than if I demand that they rehearse
for a week when they would have to work much harder, physically
and intellectually, to decipher something that I encoded in the
eye language of musical notation. The written directives bring them
into more direct contact with intuition than paper covered with
notation."

(Sometimes it is not a question of expanding the syntax *on the
page*, but of giving that task a rest and opening up the current
syntax of musicality in writers or writing in music or performance
or the life of the artist or reader, their horoscopes and paths)

"That's xactly what's involved in intuition. Musicians establish
a direct link with intuition by way of my texts. In the years ahead
I must investigate whether, for instance, a specific written
instruction leads to a specifically archetypal music - as compared
with another instruction. How can we discover ways of regulating
the process of intuitive music making?"

However to say that -

evades the question about meaning. Are we each in a hermetically sealed

It has been a long time since I have heard of rime's being identified
with a pairing of words that have the "same" vowel and "same" last
consonants. I remember that my highschool teacher (who was from
England) used to tell us that. She also mentioned all those fictions
we had to learn: slant rime, half rime, quarter rime, assonance. Etc.
I always wondered whether half rime included 12/13 rime. But to limit
the term rime to cloud and proud is a little strange after all these
years after Duncan, etc. I think that that definition would make some
sense to the people in the rumoured "new traditionalist" or whataver
those US poets are called's netlist.

I think that I know what the problem is in this discussion with H.T.
Kirby-Smith. Says "I don't remember seeing a rhyme in Ginsberg." Now,
in my experience, one is much more likely to HEAR a rime. And one
hears a lot of it in Ginsberg. As to Williams, well, he and H.D. were
the 2 Modernist poets who taught me a sense of rime, and my actual
(later) teacher was Robert Duncan. I strongly suggest reading his
great serial poem, "The Structure of Rime." Or go back to page 51 of
_The Opening of the Field_, to read "Keeping the Rhyme"

By stress and syllable
by change-rhyme and contour
we let the long line pace even awkward to its period.

The short line
we refine
and keep for candor.

This we remember:
ember of the fire
catches the word if we but hear
        ("We must understand what is happening")
and springs to desire,
a bird-right light
        sound.

This is the Yule-log that warms December.
This is the new grass that springs from the ground.
...

Or listen to the first line of the Pindar poem and explain how it is
not singing with rime.


---I think that W.T. is taking the concept of endrime and giving it
the term rime. That is, to my mind, like taking iambic pentameter and
calling it rhythm.

here's the info. on that mag. I mentioned earlier --

the January/February 1994 issue (#99) of _New Observations_, guest edited
by Harry Mathews and Lynn Crawford, is a special "Oulipo * Oupeinpo" issue--

"Oupeinpo" stands for Ouvoir de Peinture Potentielle

lots of good stuff here -- my own favorite being Thieri Foulc's "New

DEAR  CHRIS,  I'm  always up for swaps - let me know what you'd like -
how about Roy Fisher's It Follows That (Pig 1994) with its nice  fable
"A  Modern  Story"  where  Fisher  dreams  he's  made a fortune out of
running poetry competitions and vanity presses, and ends up buying the
Arts Council of Great Britain  at  a  knockdown  price.  Or  strictly,
doesn't,  because,  as  he  says,  he's a straight businessman by that
stage.

I  couldn't  possibly  tell  you the story about how Oxford refused to
publish that poem in one of their RF collections...

RHYME:  Bunting spent much of the back end of his life on an intensive
investigation of Welsh rhyme, which he described as  "all  the  things
that  hold  poetry  together"  -  including  assonances, alliteration,
half-rhyme, slip-rhyme, and other patterning devices  way  beyond  the
formalist straightjacket - but then, he also wrote:
      Follow the clue patiently and you will understand nothing
- which, of course, is where chance comes in.

BIRTHDAYS: congratulations to all concerned, and to their familiars. I
share July 13th with John Clare, John Dee and Julius Ceasar (depending
on  how  you  split the year with the old calandar). To date my global
conquest achievement is low, my black magic distinctly poor,  but  I'm
doing ok on the lyric environmentalism and insanity.

Dear Minnesotans:

What follows is a forwarded message that may interest you. All others, I
apologize for clogging this list w/this, but this is the quickest way I
could think of to impart this info:

The Minnesota Legislature has recommended a modest increase in arts funding.
The legislation, however, is still vulnerable to the veto pen of Governor Arne
Carlson.  Please call the governor's office today (May 9) or tomorrow (May 10)
at 296-3391 to express your support for the arts appropriation.  When you get
the governor's answering maching, leave a message something like the following:
"My name is ------- and I live in ----------.  My phone number is ---------.
Please support the legislature's recommendation for increased arts funding."

If many of us call, we can make a difference.  Thanks.

Chris S. -- found your nearly immediate move from interesting remark re:
lyric to a radical narrowing of the question to just a few forms of music
odd -- and the opposition even odder, as most poets & critics of my
acquaintance (an admittedly unrepresentative sampling) seem, if anything,
obsessed with punk and rap (though they may argue that the audience
produces "resistant" readings) and most listen to Stockhausen too!

ok, so maybe they only have one Stockhausen recording -- but he doesn't
usually include lyrics anyway,,, so you got to make up your own words,,,
but you _can_ dance to it --  and I usually make up my own words to
popular recordings anyway 'cause most of the lyrics printed on the sleeve
are so pathetic, but then I do that with Wagner as well, cause I don't
speak German --

This isn't exactly aleatoric, but some of my poetry has its origins in my
misunderstandings on first hearing of a piece of music -- as on the
occasion, while driving through the streets of D.C. with Rosmarie Waldrop
some years ago, when I could have sworn the gospel song playing on the car
radio was titled "Rise and Annoy the Lord."

but I'm not usually so orhpic -- and milk light isn't good for your eyes --

In celebrating the virtues of Zen and the Aleatory, I'm afraid we
may be losing sight of the still-important notion of struggle,
as opposed to the Zen idea of accepting whatever the Aleatory
hands out.
I would rather validate an Activist stance in both poetry &
politics, and promote the idea that the Real is something to
be transformed.
The Aleatory in this light becomes a provocation rather than
an end-point. It's only through resistance that we are led
to wonder.

Ira -

Those Stockhausen quotes are quite useful, thanks for providing them.
I'll respond to them after I've had a chance to to hear some of the music.

I'm afraid, though, that no amount of listening, to Stockhausen or
otherwise, will help me understand some aspects of your posting entitled
<Aleatoric Spree>, particularly the section about the spiritual side of
Cage and Stockhausen.

I find it interesting that you make these statements directly after
warning people that the following section may be too specifically musical
for general readers of <poetics>.  As you say elsewhere, <we were, after
all, talking about Zen>.

In any case, I'm asking for further help & clarification from you here.
There's a lot that I simply don't understand in your posting.

You're projecting an awful lot of your position onto my own brief
statements.

One, I really don't care if someone else's taste in music, poetry, food,
or whatever is <narrow-minded> or not.  It's hard enough to take
responsibility for one's own taste, let alone that of another.  If someone
chooses to listen only to Cage or Mozart or Presley, why do you care?

Two, these days I think most avant garde/intellectual posturing in regard
to music revolves around artists like Brian Eno, or noise bands like
Einzstuerzende Neubauten or Crash Worship.  Cage's music isn't hip enough
for most poseurs (this may be somewhat different in England, but, if I can
believe what I read in _The Wire_, not too much so.)

Three, While we seem to agree that Cage's music is often misunderstood, I
really think this is more often true for those who dismiss his music.  Can
you provide sources for the kind of misunderstanding you mean?

Very flattering, perhaps, but before you <rush to say> anything of the
sort here, you really should know more than you can about my taste in
music.

That parenthetical <s> and the semi-colon indicate how much you're
stretching here.  It really isn't clear that the paraphrase from Pound
supports your views.  & could you please quote a source where Cage says
his music supercedes all others.

Ira, you then continue with a comparison of the spritual beliefs of
Stockhausen & Cage.  But you don't compare them using equal terms.  As I
said above I am most uncomfortable with and unclear about this part of your
argument.  I look forward to your guidance in how to read the following:

> Herb, I agree with you that Stockhausen proslytises too, I was
> only making that jibe in response to your earlier message suggesting
> one might think of Cage's use of the I-Ching just in terms of numberm]
> , and it wouldn't be such an issue then; and I was just responding that
> (since I think Cage *does* use the I-Ching mostly as a number system)
> that the question remained of being a bit of a guru and yet not
> being part of a complex sacral system, but in fact an easily grasped
> rite in isolation.

Unless I totally misread you here (& this is a very convoluted statement
so I admit this could be the case), you seem to be saying that Cage's use
of a Confucian text,the I Ching, primarily as a tool, somehow calls into
question his belief in Buddhism.  Could you please explain how this is so?
Further in this sentence you seem to imply that Buddhism is _not_ a
<complex sacral system>, Cage's belief in Buddhism is not <complex>, or,
that Cage's sense of Buddhism can be too easily grasped by his audience.
Could you please clarify which, if any, of these readings you meant.  If
you mean that Cage's belief in Buddhism is not complex, how you mean this
& how do you know this?  If you mean that Cage's sense of Buddhism is too
easily grasped by his audience, how do you mean this, how do you know this
and why is it Cage's fault?

> I don't mind Stockhausen being a guru, because I
> think he's very serious about setting up a complex sacral system that'
> one cannot grasp quickly or easily.

I will readily agree with you, regardless of what you meant in the
previous sentence, that Stockhausen's sense of the spiritual cannot be
easily grasped.  Can you explain why you think this is a good thing?
Are you criticizing Cage for not devising his own <complex sacral system>?

I'm still confused by much of this & I'd appreciate help in clarifying
these points.

Bests,

Herb

Subject:      Re: Rhyme

For those interested in following through on the rhyme question, three
places come immediately to mind: Donald Wesling's *The Chances of
Rhyme* tracks the history of it's definitons and usages from the 18th
to the 20th c's; Kenneth Burke's "On Musicality in Verse" (in *The
Philosophy of Literary Form*) distinguishes some of it's amazing
diversity; and TVF Brogan in *English Versification 1570-1980*
discusses significant linguistic issues. He, in fact, argues, that
rhyme is not a "literary device" at all, but a crucial linguistic
strategy "in reduplication and word-formation". His point being
"poetry is not made out of language; poetry _is_ language."

All of this really goes to back up George's points that what we call
"full rhyme" is only a minor manifestation of rhyme, and that it
functions in profound and incalculable ways as a fundamental
organizing power of language itself.

thanks sandra for that lovely meditation.  reminds me of january chris
funkhouser and i rescued a starfish lying on the median strip of a beachside
road --dropt by seagull no doubt --still thick intact and living.  we drove by i
sd stop wasnt that a starfish on the rd, we turned back, i made chris pick it up
and we walked it down to the ocean's edge.  it felt like an augur, auspicious no
less, but of what i know not.  --maria damon

Subject:      Paul Christenson on Olson

    In his book CHARLES OLSON: CALL HIM ISHMAEL, Paul Christenson
    wrote:

  As Olson became convinced that the success of the open poem lay in
its being a model of expanded consciousness, he gradually abandoned
interest in those other features of of his original poetic: the
emphases of breath and ear on the generation of lines and syllables
in the poem. In fact, in the second triad of the MAXIMUS, these
vestiges of artifice, the play of sound and the rhythms of line
lengths, disappear altogether. [88]

At the beginning of the book, Christenson wrote: "It is a pleasure to
thank those who joined me in celebrating the life and work of a great
poet . . ."  It therefore seems reasonable to believe that the first
quotation above was not intended as hostile criticism. It seems to me
an accurate description of the poetry.

I've constantly wondered about the presence of rhyme and alliteration
(for example Anglo-Saxon) anywhere - it would seem to have a cognitive
basis - I wonder what could be traced in neural circuitry? Neural
networks utilize repetition, similarity, competition; combine these
elements with the frame problem (beginnings and endings of structures
like line endings), and rhyme could indicate neurally a conclusion and a
reinforcement of sound that interplays with the symbolic as well. In
which case, rhyme would emerge out of the Kristevan chora (what a sight!/
site!), the _matter_ of language (as in Deleuze's _matter_ of cinema),
simultaneously deflecting/ground the poem in the inchoate...

MUSING ON SOME POETS






Those poets, heads coming out of collars,
advised us, showed us how to hold paper and look good,
did we sometime grow tired of them, those
who lived for us,
died for us,
rotted under ground for us,
are still
so we may move.

Not friends, really, not teachers,
poets, whose names glittered when we were alone,
whose books dropped like gleaming newborn calves into our unsteady
hands,
did we read them as if pulling shavings off our souls,
never stepped out of the Pacific combers with shine on morning face,
never twisted body out of grip of coal giant ogre
save with inspiration of our poets,
and who knows what our
means?

What are we now besides older;
a young man newly graduated from university,
black gown still on him said I envy you and your friends,
you got to make the last ones,
there isnt anything to make now, or no one knows what there is.
I said it seems that way but there is always something,
and I showed him my teeth through yellow beer.



Do we old farts say thank you every genuflecting morning
to those poets with agate names who showed us their synapses?
Nowadays the young want us to love the earth,
And I never say out loud to them that my dear old people
Are columns of earth, walk around, sit in chairs,
discard cigarettes and write thatUs left of poems.
They were low lights between mountains visible
To the evening gaze, they were evaporate mornings,
They are not mulch but stones in the earth, they are not
specimens but the authors of words should be whispered inside a dark
bowl
from Siena.

I have no remaining skill for form,
 just feel words jostle each other in doorways on the way out, sit
here this
evening remembering a former life, IUm with friends
all lovely all restrained by hope, all agreed without saying so
Qthose poets gave us a way to waste our lives
saying useless things, smiling indulgently at each otherUs personal
diaspora,
carrying mismatched goodies on the way to the grave,
trip, fall into hole, write on dirt walls
a first and last sonnet,
solving all, coming to rest, combing hair, adjusting socks,
kissing no one but the image of Jesus, disbursing mind as if it were
mercury,
listening for the voices to arrive with the worms.

    aldon---since many of the things i was questioning about preconceptions
           about "popular lyrical music" were "between the lines" of the
           discussion (or "only in my mind"), let me consider, for instance,
           a quote i heard attributed to Robert Kelly that claims that
           while rock lyrics are like looking in a mirror, poetry breaks
           the mirror....
           (end quote--sic). Now, this of course makes poetry more like
           "aleatory" music than lyrics....and is a valuable distinction
           up to a point but one could argue the chance elements in many
           songs, the mixed metaphors even in tin pan alley (or songs like
           "chek to cheek" about "cares" vanishing like a gambler's winning
           or is it loosing streak), and the alea that occurs (perhaps
   unintentionally---but in this day of "author constructs" and authors as
   FALLACIES this shouldn't matter, right?) when the "sentiments" of the
   lyrics seem to clash with the melody they are "couched" in....These
   phrasings, and lyrical hooks, can teach one much about "craft"---and
   about the enigmatic power of cliches....and also why three chords and
   their "lyrical equivalent" are not necessarily "naive" as they might
   seem......Now, sure, maybe I wouldn't have meditated on the "double
   entendres to be found in songs like Tom Wait's "Time," Suzanne Vega's
   "Marlene On The Wall" or even whether the Moody Blues intended quotes
   around "Just what you want to be/You'll be in the end" had they appeared
   in poems rather than in melodies that one rides through the silence...
   but then I'm not one of those who agrees with the Literary Historian who
   calls the "olde English Ballad" a "hybrid" form either...It's only such
   from a specialized perspective that sees music and words as essentially
   distinct. The point I'm trying to make is that it seems why there is so
   little attention devoted SERIOUSLY to rock songs is that it's ultimately
   harder to discuss than either poetry or instrumental music in isolation
   is....(and i certainly don't claim to have found a way to do so, but I
   am curious about moves towards it). Chris Stroffolino

happy birthday. in minneapolis, may day is THE big holiday of the year, the
leftist and pagan countercultural equivalent to christmas --there's a big parade
and pageant with larger-than-life size puppets which yearly acts out the rescue
and resurrection of the tree of life by the sun, who comes rowing across a lake.
then all the puppets and paraders dance to a jazzy version "you are my
sunshine"-- all the while, off to one side, a platform with the haymarket
martyrs hanging in effigy reminds one and all of that part of history.  like
christmas or the high holidays, its when everyone gets high emotions about who
theyre going to run into at mayday (old lovers , family, etc), whose brunch they
got invited to , etc., all the kids have sparkles and face paint and the little
girls wear tiaras and may-pole like wands, everyone brings blankets and picnics
in the park where the parade ends --etc.  someone shd write something cultural
studiesish about it. it's very charming and rough-hewn, and personally i can't
stand it.--maria

Dear Ed, when you write"There's no real outside what's said"
should I understand you to be in agreement with that famous
statement of Derrida: "Nothing exists outside the sign" ?
Would poetry exist if there wasn't something real that
always manages to defeat or elude signification? I think
we are moved to transform language poetically in the direction
of the unsayable. And our means to do so is an active
principle which you, in a different context, invoked
recently: "the subversive imagination."

X-cc:         "I.LIGHTMAN" <I.Lightman@uea.ac.uk>

Thought it might be worth posting some other Stockhausen (anybody tuned
into wonderful English band Stock Hausen and Walkman yet?) quotes. He has
rather come to dominate the chance discussion and quite unfairly in my
opinion as he has little to do with it. And I do want this thread to
meander further.

'Sung sounds are individual "organic" members of the more comprehensive
"synthetic" sound family. At certain points in the compostion, the sung
sounds become comprehensible words; at others, they remain pure sound
values; between these extremes there are various degrees of
comprehensibility of the word. WHenever speech momentarily emerges from the
sound-symbols in the music, it is to praise GOd (Daniel 3, "Song of the Men
in the Fiery Furnace").
(Notes for 'Gesang der Junglinge' - 1955/56)

'. . . the voice of a boy in the unfamiliar surroundings of electronic
sounds. Suppose you would find an apple or an ashtray on a distant star.
What is so common here takes on magic there.'

'. . . in Kurzwellen, the players react, while they are actually
performing, to completely unforeseeable events which they receive on
short-wave radios. I composed the process of transformation: HOW they react
to what they hear on the radio; HOW they imitate and modulate it, transpose
it in time - longer or softer; WHEN and HOW and HOW OFTEN they play
synchronously or alternatingly, in duos, trios or quartets; HOW they call
and invite one another to hear 'together' an event wandering for a long
period of time among them, to let it shrink or glow, to compress it or
expand it, to darken it or to lighten it, to concentrate it or to decorate
it playfully.
What could be more general, more suprapersonal, inclusive, universal,
instantaneous than the 'broadcasts' that become musical 'material' in
Kurzwellen? How can we break out of the sealed world of radio waves that
encase our globe like a musical retina? Does not a great deal of what we
receive on our short-wave radios already sound as if it came from quite
different spaces, beyond speech, reportage, "music", morse code?'
(Stockhausen, translated by Rolf Gehlhaar in 1968)

These are just two examples but they illustrate Stockhausen as being more
concerned with the borders between Composition and Improvisation than with
chance and aleatoric procedures  -  for me. He goes on to use terminology
such as 'human spirit', 'unity', 'higher unity', 'preconsciousness', While
not being totally humourless (obvious paradoxes such as musical retina
aside) I find the invocation of such 'concepts' (without definition to
focus their use) to be a party to utopian mystification. Quite honestly I
enjoy listening to these earlier pieces (including in addition 'Mikrophonie
I' and 'Mikrophonie II' and 'Mantra') but am bugged by his increasingly
mystical justifications. I feel that Stockhausen really wants to retain
CONTROL whilst appearing to be offering a generous and improvisatory space
to his musicians and chipping away at the block of creator's absoluteness
which was the hard scree of sixties art politics fashion. In fact he often
comes across as being self-important  -  not at all as humble as he might
have tried to act. I found this to be especially true of him 'in person'.

Any takers on Miles Davis, Sun Ra or Hermeto Pascoal and more rough hewn
humourous dynamics?    And then what about chance? Hasn't this discussion
been hovering in differentials between 'aleatoric compositon' and
extemporisation / improvisation?

Subject:      The List Itself (2): How to Unsub and Other Stories

In the "Welcome" message for this list I give a misleading instruction on how
to unsubscribe to the list.  To do this send a one line message (no subject
line) to listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu:

unsub poetics

do not include your name in this command.

You can temporarily stop getting mail (for example if you will be off line for
a while) by sending this message:

set poetics nomail

and then get mail again by:

set poetics mail

*this is easier than subbing and unsubbing*

& y'all know about:

set poetics digest

which can be turned off by "set poetics mail"

I hope this is all correct!  Let me know if not.

****

As of today, there are 222 subscribers to Poetics.

I want to add my thanks to Loss Glazier for the pioneering work he is doing
with EPC.  As things are getting tougher at SUNY, I know there is a greater
squeeze on him at his official library job.  While EPC is exactly the sort of
thing a public university should be committed to supporting, Loss's work on EPC
is all on his own time -- as, of course,  is much of the work of the other
editors and publishers, and poets, hereabouts.

If you haven't checked into EPC via WW or lynx, I encourage you to do so, and
to let us know what you think:

URL=gopher://writing.upenn.edu/hh/internet/library/e-journals/ub/rift

You will find a month by month archive of the Poetics List going back to the
December 8, 1993, announcement of Robin Blaser's The Holy Forest and taking us
through March 1995.  Loss has spent a good deal of time reformatting this
archive to make it easier to read and to search (we also had to manually put
together the files for the first several months of Poetics).

AND just out -- the new Rif/t, which I assume most of you get by direct
subscrition, but which is also available at the EPC.  Especially recommend
in the hypertext versions.

*****

One final note, especially to those who don't post much: PLEASE
post information on your recent publications, books or articles or works
just out or immediately forthcoming.  There are some people on the list
who have had books out in the past few years but never announced them here.
Now is the time!

this is one of the "Other Stories".  Since you point out that "some people on

--I'm one of them, with the great visionary Henri Michaux, thus:

DARKNESS MOVES: AN HENRI MICHAUX ANTHOLOGY 1927-1984
Selected, translated and presented by David Ball
University of California Press, 1994

342 pages

Selections from all Michaux's major collections.  30 pp. of plates (b&w,
unfortunately--choice of Michaux's drawings and paintings).

$30 well worth it.

John Byrum throws out the question "How much Real is transformed
via poetry?"

I favour Spicer's idea of correspondings, as put in "After
Lorca".  The idea that the real is not in poetry, but that
poetry creates corresponding times and places.  It carries the
real across making this lemon correspond with your lemon.  I suppose
there isn't transformation happening, as the real is not being
treated, but seeking some kind of agreement, maybe.

By the by, did anyone catch today's interview with the translator
of Perec's eless work? It was on CBC this morning.

At Charles Bernstein's suggestion, here are two publications I'll make you

PURE MENTAL BREATH was brought out by Gesture Press at the end of 1994.
Features photography by Blaine Spiegel and Poetry by me.  81 pages of text.
Ordering information:  Nick Power, Editor.  Gesture Press 68 Tyrrel Avenue
Toronto, Ont. Canada M6G 2G4.  Price in U.S. is $12.00, I believe.  And
$15.00 Canadian, if I'm not mistaken. AVAILABLE THROUGH SMALL PRESS
DISTRIBUTION.

A CLOVE OF GENDER by yours truly just emerged from Stride Press. 158 pages.
Ordering information:  Rupert Loydell, Editor.  Stride Press.  11 Sylvan
Road, Exeter, Devon. EX4 6EW England. English price 7.95, so I assume the
U.S. price will be about $16.00, but don't have final information yet.
AVAILABLE THROUGH SMALL PRESS DISTRIBUTION.

Dear Cris 'n Carl,
                Just to extend this to another generation of high thinking--
as in 'high steppin'' I took it--Sigmar Polke, and his famous HOHERE WESEN
BEFAHLEN: RECHTE OBERE ECKE SCHWARZ MALEN! (Higher Beings Command: Paint the
top right hand corner black!) c.1966. Apart from these words, the canvas is
blank except for its black corner on the top right. he also did a painting
of flamingos which was accompanied by the following text ( it was in german)
       I stood in front of the canvas and tried to paint a bunch of
       flowers. Then I received fromhigher beings the command: No
       bunches of flowers! Paint flamingos! At first I tried to continue
       painting. But then I realised that they meant business.

Poetry is the unfolding courses of the real. Jack Foley, in his STANZAS FROM
DJERASSI says,

to stay
at the edge
of blackness
to
keep
faith
with
light

Poetry is the real projecting in one of the million directions into the
unknown, shedding light, advancing outward. Poetry is the real at the
threshold, authenticity before reality checks in.

--just to add this to the discussion on poetry and the real
("jouissance!"), is any one familiar with this essay by canadian artist
vera frenkel: "Benign Ignorance"? it first came out in a 1977 edition of
what was then artscanada (now canadian art, i think). "Benign ignorance
can be described as a state of unfocused awareness that permits us to
link the confusing world with the deep metaphoric formulations inside us
which are strategies for its apprehension. To reach these and give them
form in art requires setting knowledge aside, reclaiming it later as
necessary.
        It follows from this that a work of art is as good as the amount
of knowledge and ignorance it holds in balance. The more conflicting
knowledge a work can hold suspended in a transforming ignorance, the
better it teaches us to see" (27).

interesting to note that the opening epigram is lionel kearns' great
concrete poem: "The Birth of God."

I will simply add a testimonial.  I have heard Alan present individual
sections of his critical study of anthologies over recent years, and the
work has been consistently insightful and valuable.  I would think it
just the thing you'd like to read, given your historicizing efforts in
poetry.

Writing between the Lines: Race and Intertextuality.  pub'd last Summer
by U of Georgia Press at an unconscionable price (but cheaper than Alan's

Cambridge,, next year.

I can't seem to remember right off hand, bookless, where Olson uses
"postmodern."  Jamming to finish a piece of cyberspace before
Johnnt Mnemonic comes out at the local cinema, I hope you will
forgive this simple query.  My flu prvents my crossing town to

"postmodern" for his now?  Thanks.  By the way, his engagement of Norbert

As I remember, Olson uses postmodern in a letter to Creeley in 1951
(52?); in Vol 1 (Vol 2?) of their correspondence. On some scrap of paper
somewhere I may have the page number; I looked it up once.

Thank you, Bob, I think I do have those letters here at home, too.
Good to hear your voice; I am sure Olson would say "voice."  Perhaps
I shouldn't, then.  I am hoping that I find another of those paper scraps
if it turns out not being the correspondence.  Pretty sure, though, it's
not the "Mayan Letters."  I'll give this a shot.

Well, I read Edna, on the ferry and elsewhere, and don't find a problem
there, it's still east-village now.

If rhyme gives structure to nostalgia, I'd think it's on the level of
repetition in neural networks at the first, also the infolding or
implicate order of the poem, collapse into auto-fetishization, neither
sound nor meaning: not-language, incantation. But the buildup of a
structure in the mind, and not memory in the sense of recall, but in the
sense of the fit of a frame.

Would always read Edna. By the way, some of her best work is in her
translations from Baudelaire. Not Baudelaire, not Edna, but definitely
late-night, like the Smiths who are playing in this room as I write.

Herb (and Cris)

As I said, thanks for all the stuff you posted about Cage, which has
been really illuminating; and thanks to John Byrum whose post on Jackson
MacLow, chance and sentimentality was great, as Cris has already said
(to me anyway). I hope you don't really mind that I'm retreating, it's
what I *want* to do.

I'm a fan of lots of MacLow's Pieces of Six book, don't know about
"sentimentality" as what I think is likeably found or avoided, *in*
the text, I thought sentimentality was a good description of the hopes
and claims invested in the genre at the point MacLow ducked it, I
like the freshness, the feeling of discovery, in the Pieces of Six.
But one thing that's been on my mind since I read it has been the way
that in the explicit sex scene in the book MacLow uses phrases like
"then I was inside her", and I'm amazed that explicit sex scene
language thus seems to evade MacLow's concern elsewhere through the
book to see language as surface sometimes, to take metaphors literally
and explore why metaphors have mystified themselves into realist
"descriptive" language.

I mean, surely he doesn't mean his entire body from head to toe *was*
inside a sexual partner's entire body from head to toe, especially
without specifying how this happened!Transporter beam, phase-shift?

Anyone else interested in the chances writers take in using metaphors
about the body?

Ira,

Totally, totally.

I learned how to write about the body from gay men, I learned how to write
about my own body from gay men.  I remember reading a passage in one of
Kevin's pieces where he compares his penis to the logo of a world's
fair--and it was like click, shift--I got it.  And my writing changed right
there on the spot.

I'm not sure how to describe it, but it's certainly not about description,
or equivalences even.  The text as its own seductive surface.

this misreads Spicer and the privilege of correspondence. correspondence is neither creation nor transformation but recognition. even emerson, however absorbed he was with mutability, knew that. nor is there seeking, which is academic, willed.

First the other:  Poetics list readers will likely enjoy Doug Gunn's
new book of stories, _The Invention of Violence_, available for $11.95
with free postage and handling from Cinco Puntos Press, 2709 Louisville,
El Paso, TX 79930, of 1-800-566-9072.  160 pages of work, blurbs by Creeley
and Olson (Toby, not Charles):  "I know of no other recent writer whose
language has captured the world with such authenticity.  Reading Douglas
Gunn's fiction, I think of John Berger on van Gogh:  'Wherever he looked
he saw the labour of existence; and this labour, recognized as such, for him
constituted reality.'"

Now the self:  _Apocalypse and After:  Modern Strategy and Postmodern Tactics
in Pound, Williams, and Zukofsky_, pub. 1995 by the University of Alabama
Press.  $24.95 in paper (blurbs included)--and it actually seems to be
available in the Borders Book Chain.

I agree with Charles (Bernstein, not Olson):  there should be more of this.
Awkward as it is to plug one's own work, it's good to hear directly about
others' books.

My guess is that Olson would have known vaguely of the "Modernism" the
Church berated at the turn of the Century, that French thing with its
English influences, but I don't think that knowledge would have shaded
his sense of Modernism as the Joyce/Pound thing.  (I can't in fact locate
in my reading or memory any period of Olson's life when he studied _as_ a
Catholic;  his schooling was secular, and I never noticed the aura of
Catholic academic intellectualism about him.  And Modernism was not
something inveighed against in church pulpits so much as in editorials in
the Catholic press.  Though Modernism was _always_ a bad name.)

As far as I can tell, Postmodernism was first used by the Revd Bernard
Iddings Bell, an Episcopal divine buried a mile from me.  I've seen the
reference, it dates to well before the man in the street thought of
Modernism in any but the ecclesiastical, Gallican, anti-ultramontane
position.

Just a note:

        I don't believe he discusses Olson, but Paul Giles' Catholic
Fictions is a good source on the influence of catholicism on such figures
as Fitzgerald, Warhol, and, even Mapplethorpe (if I'm remembering correctly).

yes --and to add to the maze of allusions, remember "it's got to be REAL" as the
theme song of Paris is Burning, in which the criteria for winning drag-contests
was "realness" --i.e. successful simulation --to the point of boundary-blurring

Andrew Joron writes 10 May:  "celebrating the virtues of Zen and the Aleatory, I'm afraid we
may be losing sight of the still-important notion of struggle,
as opposed to the Zen idea of accepting whatever the Aleatory
hands out.
"I would rather validate an Activist stance in both poetry &
politics, and promote the idea that the Real is something to
be transformed.
"The Aleatory in this light becomes a provocation rather than
an end-point. It's only through resistance that we are led
to wonder."

There is an old dubious myth that "acceptance" must be somehow passive.
"Working with the given" (i.e. not wishing for the stars, accepting
the actualities) wd be an
attitude that could be useful. I don't know whether that is out of
accord with Buddhism or Taoism, but it sounds like
 a sensible way of carrying on.

Dear Carl,
         I've got no further with the labyrinth that Duchamp
specifically mentions which is the one "beyond space and time". The
puzzle is not what is a labyrinth but what is Marcel doing beyond the
frame of space and time, and trying to find his way out of that.  I
can only guess that this is a recognition of a state of
consciousness, from which he has to find his way out, to the
particulars of these dimensions of the world.

mentioned that Willy was paying for brunch at Art's Cafe, it went out
on the network, and dozens of hungry poets and professors arrived in

a small loan at the Bank of Montreal to pay for all those eggs and
toast, etc! He;s really burned, so watch out for him on Friday at

Kathryne & interested folk:

I remember Joe Riddel saying it (Olson's use of the word post-modern,
which I believe Olson was said to have hyphenated) was in The Special View
of History, but not having a copy I can't say just where.  Hope that
helps.

  Olson uses the term postmodernism in a letter to Creeley in 1951.
  It appears in volume 7 of the correspondence (I don't have the book here
  to give the exact page).  Randall Jarrell uses the term earlier (1948,
  I believe) in a discussion of Lowell's Lord Weary's Castle which he
  defines as "post or anti- modernist"

Subject:      Outlaws, Classics, and others

Associate Professor of English, U. of Louisville

Dear all--

Since luigi posted his request for a bit more info. on From Outlaw to Classic
on the list rather than backchannel, I thought I'd respond publicly, in case
others are interested. If you're not--sorry, bear with me, it'll only be one
paragraph.

So: the book's a fairly materialist (though not in any strictly Marxist sense)
literary history of canonical issues in mostly twentieth-century American
poetry. "Mostly" because one of the five chaps. goes back to the late
eighteenth century, the rest focus on post-1900. "Materialist" in that it
tries to come at questions of canonicity via engaging specific texts,
conflicts, lives, institutional politics, etc. rather than via a more
theoretical take; perhaps I can clarify by contrast--it's pretty much the
opposite end of the spectrum from Barbara Herrnstein Smith's Contingencies of
Value, Charlie Altieri's Canons and Consequences, or even much of John
Guillory's work, wonderful though those books are in various ways. More like
Cary Nelson's Repression and Recovery probably. Chap. 1 is a history of
American poetry anthologies from the Revolutionary Period up to Weinberger and
Hoover (only a few pages on these two, because the Hoover text wasn't even out
when I went to press); chap. 2 argues for a synthesis of two models of canon
formation, the aesthetic (briefly, the argument that poets make
canons--Vendler, Bloom, other) and the institutional (various forms of
literary instititution and those affiliated with them make canons). This chap.
has an extended (though reasonably polite, I think) argument with Vendler and
Blom that might appeal to readers of this list, and a section on the notion of
self-canonization using Berryman as an example. Chap. 3: "The New Criticism
and American Poetry in the Academy"--on the New Crit. construction of a
modernist American canon--chap. sections are "Evaluation and the Institutional
Politics of New. Crit.," "Amateurism, Professionalism, and the
Poet-Professor," "The New Crit., Whitman, and the Idea of a National Poetry"
(anti-Whitmanism as a factor in New Crit. canon-making), and a section on
Brooks and Warren's Understanding Poetry. Chap. 4: "Little Magazines and
Alternative Canons: The Example of Origin"--on the first series of Origin, and
the place/role of little mags. in poetic canon formation. Chap. 5:
"'Provisionally complicit resistance': Language Writing and the Institution(s)
of Poetry"--on how we can situate LP in relation to certain aspects of
contemporary institutional/critical politics, partly via "close readings"
(remember them?) of two Charles Bernstein poems.

Jeez, I did go on, didn't I? Sorry. Aldon--thanks for the kind plug from
elsewhere! It does feel awkward to plug one's own work, but personally I'm
very grateful for the information I've gotten about other books the last few
days, and hope everyone will keep this up.

Kathy L.--one early place that Olson used "pomo" is in a fall 1952 course
description for the BMC catalog. However, the earliest use by CO that I have a
note of handily is a letter to Creeley Aug. 9, 1951 (Correspondence vol. 7, p.
75). Maybe someone knows an earlier one. I don't have my notes on the
unpublished essays to hand, and can't remember if "pomo" shows up there.
Olson's use of the term wasn't the first use, period, and not even the first
"literary" use, but I figure you know that.

Marisa--I even teach Millay. From Am. Lit. surveys to graduate seminars. But
then I'm perverse.

hi tony, thanks for this. --it's the "beyond time and space" thing that

Introduction and History

        The Summer Writing Program in Writing and Poetics at the Naropa
Institute is a month-long convocation of students, scholars, fiction writers,
Buddhist teachers, Sufi anarchists, feminist scholars, poets and translators.
In dialogue with renowned practioners of the poetic arts, students
confront the composition of poetry and prose.  Each summer practioners of
visual and performance arts join poets and fiction writers in
collaborative situations.  Faculty and students meet individually and in
small groups, so that beginning and experienced writers find equal
challenge in the program.
        Participants work in daily contact with some of the most
accomplished and notoriously provocative writers of our times - scribes
and performers currently charting the directions American writing is
taking.  The tradition emphasized belongs to the "outrider" or left-hand
lineage, which operates outside the cultural mainstream - a heritage of
powerful scholarship and counter poetics.  Guest faculty change weekly,
magnetizing the summer program into a forum that confronts, responds to
and intensely challenges a range of writing practices and scholarly methods.
        As political and ecological crises intensify across our planet,
the writer's role raises troubling questions.  Bard, "unacknowledged
legislator," prophet - or marginal word monger?  The program provides
three distinct forums which address these concerns:  writing workshops
directed by guest and resident faculty; daily lectures, readings and
colloquia; and faculty-student interviews in which writings are discussed
in face-to-face intimacy.
        The summer program developed out of the Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics, founded in 1974 by Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman.
1995 is the Summer Program's 21st year.  Regular features include a
month-long fiction track, MFA lectures by distinguished faculty, and an
ongoing examination of the environmental, cultural, and linguistic crises
occurring on our North American continent.
        Open to any interested participant, the Summer Writing Program
also serves each year as a third trimester for the Naropa Institute's
accredited MFA degree track.  Students from other institutions or degree
programs may elect to attend the month-long program with a six-credit
option (for BA credit) or eight-credit option (MFA credit).  Masters
level credit requires permission of the program directors.

 from the Summer Cataloge

* Week One

**The Poetry of Lust of Love
Sam Hamill
        The poetry of lust and love...is rooted in spiritual longing, as
demonstrated by the poetics of Sappho and the amatory poems of the Greek
anthology and the classical poets of India, China, and Japan.  Drawing on
these traditions, we explore the erotic lyrical imagination from a
layman's Zen perspective, including a look at the poetry of several Zen
masters.

**Illuminating Inscapes
Katie Yates
        Writing is an expression which takes textural knowledges and puts
it into a textual form.  Attention will be focused on the maitri rooms
which we will take to represent a study of/in sensory experience.
Writing and collage are the vehicles for this study.  This is an
intensive investigation of the forms the artists seizes to carry the
weight of intellectual acuity inside the extraordinary space of creativity.

**Both, Both
Anne Waldman
        This is a workshop inviting "negative capability."  We explore
how jumpy imagination and eye and emotion work through various writing
experiments that embrace contradiction:  being silent, being amitious,
being noisy, being deceptive.  What's hidden/what's revealed?  Writing on
top of writing.  Can you ever really sit still?

**Writing, Walking
Andrew Schelling
        "I wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute freedom and
wildness--."  That's how Thoreau began his essay on walking.
Naturalists, contemplatives, artists, poets, from Ice Age Magdalena to
T'ang Dynasty China to 20th century nuclear-powered America have gone to
the forests and mountains to find fresh thought and language.  We go to
local mountain trails to practice a variety of procedures--direct
observation, cut-up of texts, study of field manuals.  Also dream
states--particularly for those accustomed to higher altitudes.  The
dakinis of poetry conceal themselves in solitary places.  We "send back
our embalmed hearts only as relics--.'

Week Two

**Paradise,or the Theory and Practice of Poles
Lyn Hejinian
        A course on "extreme latitudes," literal and figurative.

**Distilled Spirits
Wang Ping
        This course explores how to translate your life into fiction.  We
consider the way culture limits and distracts us and how we liberate
ourselves in writing from cultural and psychological boundaries.

**Chinese Poetics
Arthur Sze
        This workshop incorporates various aspects of Chinese poetics,
including a brief look at poems by:  Chang Chi, Li Po, Wang Wei, Li Ho,
and Li Ch'ing-chao, as well as discussion of the I Ching.

**Sound Poems
Ide Hintze
        This course involves exercises with the voice:  working beyond
the alphabetic code.  Students compose two and three-voice poems, choric
and phonetic poems.  Emphasis is also placed on the performance uses of
audio and video.

Week Three

**One's-Self I Sing
Steven Taylor
        Everybody sings.  Why?  For thousands of years, poetry, history
and the law were sung, but this practice did not cease with the
development of writing.  Culture, the story we tell ourselves about
ourselves about who we are, is performed in our relationships, political
systems, rituals, and in our art works.  Song provides a forum for the
negotiation of identity.  How do songs locate subjects in the framework
of subjection?  How does song performance reproduce, problematize,
negotiate, or change subject positions in structures of dominance?  The
class listens to music and discusses readings.

**Introduction to Letterpress Printing
Julie Seko
        This class introduces letterpress printing.  Students learn the
history of fine printing, setting type, locking type, operating the press
and work in small groups to design and produce broadsides.

**The Cut-Up Technique
Anselm Hollo
        This offering includes a discussion of the "cut-up technique"
introduced by William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin, its antecedents in
the visual art forms of montage and collage (Eisenstein, Schwitters), and
Dadaist methods of composition (Tristan Tzara).  It also examines its
refinements and ramifications in the OULIPO group's compositional theory
and practice.  Students create some texts of their "own" by various
related means.

Week Four

**This Side of Memory
Norma Cole
        For centuries of lyric address--from Dante's "intelletto
d'amore"(Vita Nuova) to Roberto Tejada's "love's social intellect"
(The Gauntlet")--something has been going on record involving these
terms.  WHAT ABOUT THIS GENEALOGY? Each of the three seminars are
structured around a brief introduction and a lot of reading together and
discussion in order to explore the geometry of love, social and
intellect:  and how their relations and tensions motivate and shape,
along with memory and song, what we agree to call lyric.  Students are
encouraged to choose and bring work to be included in the discussion.

**How to Read-How to Write
Lee Ann Brown
        As readers, we are always writing and as writers we are always
reading. When we read, we actively produce our own unique interpretation
of that text.  Our own poetry can be read (and written) as a map of our
readings (or misreadings) of other writer's words and of the world.  What
would happen if we used Gertrude Stein's book "How to Write" as a
composition manual?  Her "Poetry & Grammar" as a grammar primer?  What
are our own ideas, beliefs and feelings about syntax, punctuation,
grammar, the alphabet--the very building blocks of language?  We read
from great models for plans of study such as Pound's "ABC's of Reading,
Zukofsy's "A Test of Poetry" and Ed Sander's "Investigative Poetics."
This class serves as a forum for students to work out their own plans and
structures for long-term readings and writing projects.

**The Third Image
David Levi-Strauss
        The Third Image is what can happen between words and images.  A
short history of this phenomenon is presented from hieroglyphs and
illuminations to multimedia and we write into, on, and around images
found and made.  "What I love is the relation of the image and the
text...The way poets used to enjoy working on difficult problems of
versification.  The modern equivalent is to find a relation between text
and images." Roland Barthes

**Method and Madness
Rosemarie Waldrop
        This class includes readings and practice in methods for
generating and manipulating ("translating") texts.  We draw on procedures
of Dada, Surrealism, Oulipo, Cage, Mac Low, etc.  while keeping in mind
the need to give an occasional nudge to any rule or constraint to keep
them from becoming mechanical.

**Current Poetic Music
Alice Notley
        We discuss American poetic music at present, with a view towards
how one improves one's own sound and line creating variety,
individuality, and pleasure.  There is in-class writing and assignments.
Special attention is paid to measure and music in longer narrative and
hybrid works.

*Sexing the Poem
Eleni Sikelianos
        Language is a skin:  I rub my language against the other.  It is
as if I had words instead of fingers or fingers at the tips of my words
(Barthes).  The song:  first music from the first voice of love
(Cixous).  Regardless of the subject or treatment, writing; language; has
an eros.  We are full of "luminous torrents" which are then traced onto
the page.  Pleasures of the text:  words off in the mouth, fill the ear;
they form within and spill from the body/field.  With erotogeneity in
mind, we write, we read.  Not writing erotica, but writing corporeal--to
inject a little jouissance back into the poem.

Dear Dodie, I beg to differ! I don't think the Real can be or
ought to be approached only through "deep irony." I capitalize
the term to indicate that it possesses, for me, some kind of
finality, sublimity even: as that which always, finally escapes
representation. However you choose to interpret it, though, it
makes a brilliant title!

Yes!  Warhol is really real.  He's the only one that admits art isn't art
unless it has streaks and smudges. Imperfection is the real art of being
artistic.

On the Postmodern from Olson on, etc.: I still think one of the best places
to look for discussion of this is in the very first issue of BOUNDARY 2,
which has, among other things, David Antin's symptomatic essay on the
postmodern.  Read today, this represents a Utopian phase, very different
from the way the term postmodern was used later. the issue in question
appeared in 1972.
I've tried to trace the term and comment on its development in a piece in
CRITICISM, Summer 1993 that I first gave at Charlie Altieri's conference
on PoMo along with Kathryne Lindberg and others at U-Wash. a few months
earlier.  I was amused to see that although most people here haven't read
it, it's been translated into Italian in a new poetry journal called BALDUS.

Whatever the case, the term is used today almost antithetically from what
was the case in Olson (for sure!) and even antithetically from Antin's
positive description of the postmodern as everything new, cutting edge,
avant-garde, exciting, anti-formalist, etc etc etc.

I agree with Aldon Nielsen that it's time we scrapped it!

Subject:      Ern Malley: A Real Cut-Up
In-Reply-To:  <Pine.HPP.3.91.950516155626.5180A-100000@lungta.naropa.edu>

Reading the following course description (from Chris Funkhouser's
forwarding of Naropa material) ...

        **The Cut-Up Technique
        Anselm Hollo
                This offering includes a discussion of "cut-up technique"
introduced by William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin, its antecedents in
the visual art forms of montage and collage (Eisenstein, Schwitters), and
Dadaist methods of composition (Tristan Tzara). It also examines its
refinements and ramifications in the OUILIPO group's compositional theory
and practice. Students create some texts of their "own" by various
related means.

... and the current discussion re: "Real," makes me want to yammer on
uncontrollably about a recent (4 days ago) "groovy book" find: _The
Darkening Ecliptic_, by "Ern Malley," published in Melbourne, Australia
in 1944.
        "Ern Malley" was a pseudonym made up by two Australian poets
(whose names aren't in this booklet) who wanted to "expose" "the sham" of
"modernism," the sort of thing being published in Australia at that time
through Max Harris' magazine _Angry Penguins_. These two poets got together one
afternoon and composed 16 poems (using what sounds like Ye Olde Berrigan
Methodology), and then spent the next couple of days fleshing out "Ern"'s
"life." Here's a sample description of their technique, in their own
words:
        "We produced the whole of Ern Malley's tragic life-work in one
afternoon, with the aid of a chance collection of books which happened to
be on our desk: the Concise Oxford Dictionary, a Collected Shakespeare,
Dictionary of Quotations, etc.
        "We opened books at random choosing a word or phrase haphazardly.
We made lists of these and wove them into nonsensical sentences.
        "We misquoted and made false allusions. We deliberately
perpetrated bad verse, and selected awkward rhymes from a Ripman's
Rhyming Dictionary.
        "The alleged quotation from Lenin in one of the poems, 'The
emotions are not skilled workers,' is quite phoney.
        "The first three lines of the poem 'Culture as Exhibit' were
lifted as a quotation from an American report on the drainage of
breeding-grounds of mosquitoes."

Here were their "rules of composition":

        "1. There must be no coherent theme, at most, only confused and
inconsistent hints at a meaning held out as a bait to the reader.
        "2. No care was taken with verse technique, except occasionally
to accentuate its general sloppiness by deliberate crudities.
        "3. In style the poems were to imitate not Mr. Max Harris in
particular, but the whole literary fashion as we knew it from the works
of Dylan Thomas, Henry Treece and others."

        So, after making 16 poems as per above specs, said poets sent a letter
(allegedly from Ern's sister Ethel) to Max Harris, with a couple of poems.
The letter gave a brief account of Ern's life & death (to Grave's disease
-- which isn't fatal), stating that the poems were found by Ethel while
going through Ern's belongings.
        Harris took the bait, asked for more poems, and "Ethel" sent the
whole batch. The poems were printed, with a laudatory preface by Harris,
in the next issue of _Angry Penguins_. Then, the hoax was leaked to the
press. _Angry Penguins_ sold out very quickly. So, Harris then decides to
reprint the whole manuscript, his laudatory preface, and a facsimile of
Ethel's initial letter to him, as a 48-page booklet, wanting (I guess) to
both take advantage of the sudden popularity of "Malley" as well as to
try to "save face." (This lovely, lovely booklet begins with an
introduction by Harris, which concludes: "...we do not wish to express an
opinion either on the literary merit of the poetry or on the value of the
hoax. These matters will be fully dealt with in the succeeding issue of
_Angry Penguins_ [God, if I could find a copy of *that*!], and all it is
desired to do here is to present, to as wide a public as possible, the
works of Ern Malley and the introductory material that was originally
published with them.")
        Now, w/out further ado, here's the last 18 lines from Ern Malley's
"PETIT TESTAMENT," a *thoroughly* entertaining cut-up from the 40s:

        It is something to be at last speaking
        Though in this No-Man's-language appropriate
        Only to No-Man's-Land.
        Set this down too:
        I have pursued rhyme, image, and metre,
        Known all the clefts in which the foot may stick,
        Stumbled often, stammered,
        But in time the fading voice grows wise
        And seizing the co-ordinates of all existence
        Traces the inevitable graph

        And in conclusion:
        There is a moment when the pelvis
        Explodes like a grenade. I
        Who have lived in the shadow that each act
        Casts on the next act now emerge
        As loyal as the thistle that in session
        Puffs its full seed upon the indicative air.
        I have split the infinitive. Beyond is anything.


Apologies to everyone previously familiar with Malley. Everyone else, if
you're interested, a book was published maybe a year or two ago called
_The Ern Malley Affair_, which details the events, and, I think, includes
most or all of the material in this booklet.
        Jonathan Brannen -- what were the names of the two poets? (I knew
to pick up _The Darkening Ecliptic_ because Jonathan had, only a month
prior, been telling me about _The Ern Malley Affair_, which he'd just read.)

TO SUM UP: _The Darkening Ecliptic_, by Ern Malley (Adelaide, 1944) ...

                GROOVE FACTOR: A perfect 10.

Yours,

Gary

Andrew,

I would never question the authenticity of your experiences, and I agree
that those moments when representation breaks down are what make the rest
of the druggery bearable.  But, I don't see how this necessarily has
anything to do with the real.  I could call in a higher authority here and
quote something, but I don't think quoting is much fun unless you tweak and
twist the passage to the point of deformity.

How about an anecdote instead!  I had drug flashbacks for a number of years
and during these experiences I felt, on a gut level, how random and faulty
are our capacities for filtering in the world.

The real is like god, Andrew, it will always elude you.

Dodie

Just want to second Marjorie's plug of the early Antin piece on pomo.  I
guess it is utopian.  But what I remember (cf. Beckett's Belaqua) is the
refutation not the proof: the essay is really smart and vitriolic about the
bad version of American new criticism's use of Eliot--Snodgrass, I think it
is, gets called a rebirth of "A Shropshire Lad" masquerading as the legacy
of modernism.  Worth the price of admission.  Altieri's take on so-called
so-called workshop poetry (/Sense and Sensibility/) is wonderfully smart and
vitriolic.  Antin's piece is much nastier and even more fun.  It's not
always necessarily right, but it's a ride.

here's to gorgonzola!

Gary Sullivan's description of the <Ern Malley> business ties in nicely
with a discussion I was having on the back channel before my computer died
last week (please save me from stupid <intelligent> batteries) about the
implications of the use of an unacknowledged pseudonym with a false, and
provocative, biography.

My position was that the poems were pretty good regardless and that the
whole project fell into the tradition of avant garde identity-play.  My
correspondent was less sure and took some offense at some of the
implications.

Who is being tricked, about what, and how much does it matter if the poems
seem pretty good?

Any comments?

Nice try, but the look and feel is all wrong, on my computer at least. It
came in as two lines not three and wasn't broken up in the middle of words
like ed foster's postings usually are here.  It's also not as compacted
as his postings are.

So who is this <really> trying to imitate Aldon Nielsen trying to imitate
ed foster, anyway?

Subject:      Olson and postmodern

I've come into this thread late, so I may be repeating an
earlier message from someone else. If so, please bear
with and excuse me.

Robin Blaser, in the process of writing notes on his
correspondence with Olson for the Minutes of the Charles
Olson Society, tells me (and he got it from Ralph Maud
who got it from George Butterick) that Olson adopted the
term postmodern ("we are the post-modern") from Arnold
Toynbee, who attaches the term to the year 1875 in A
Study of History, volume ONE (1933), p. 171. Olson
probably (according to Butterick via Maud via Blaser --
though there is no record of Toynbee in Olson's reading
as compiled by and according to Maud) took it from
Somervel's abridgment of the first six volumes of
Toynbee's A Study of History (1946) page 39, where
Toynbee's graph of chifting civilisations labels, in
single quotes, the period "1875 - ?" as "'post-modern' ?"

Full documentation of this (and a great deal else
besides) will be in the next issue of the
     Minutes of the Charles Olson Society,
published by Ralph Maud at
     1104 Maple Street
     Vancouver BC  Canada V6J 3R6
and available for a modest fee from the Society at that
address.

Subject:      Re: Herb Levy & Tom Mandel

     Dear Herb (& Tom, a few words re: your & Dan's _Absence Sensorium_
conclude this):
     As you're probably well aware from your back-channel discussion,
"authenticity" and "value" are hardly cut & dry. I've given a lot of
thought to these issues and have never reached any comfortable (static)
position with respect to either.
     When I was in college 10 years ago, I perpetrated a kind of "hoax" of
my own -- though my intentions were relatively benign compared to "the Ern
Malley affair."
     I had developed a pretty serious crush on one of the editors of the
university's "experimental poetry" magazine. This was many years before
I'd begun reading & writing poetry w/any seriousness.  At the time, I
didn't much appreciate the kind of work published in this magazine. But, I
had a crush on one of the editors, and was too shy to try (as a "normal"
person might) to simply engage her in conversation. I assumed she wouldn't
have any interest in me because I didn't (then) write poetry, or for that
matter, know anything *about* poetry.
     I got it into my head that, if I could write poetry like the work in
this editor's magazine, she might suddenly become "interested" in me, or
at the very least, it might be a way to see that our paths would
eventually cross. I decided to study the poems in her magazine and try to
make up some of my own, using pretty much the techniques described by Ern
Malley's creators. I cribbed from much less "lofty" sources; took material
from things found in the San Francisco _Chronicle_, mostly from the
crossword puzzle.
     My roommate at the time was a poet whose work had been in this
magazine, and he knew how I felt about the editor, as well as about the
magazine's contents. So, I told him my plan, and showed him my poems. He
liked the poems, felt I could probably get the magazine to publish them,
but said that it was a mistake for me to look at them as "hoaxes." I went
ahead and submitted the poems, and two of them were published. I think my
friend then told the editors that I considered my poems "hoaxes," but
nothing much ever came of that, as I think the editors (rightly) felt that
it didn't matter much how *I* felt about the poems, as they were, by the
standards of the people writing for & reading that magazine, perfectly
appropriate things for someone to be writing.
     The poems I wrote for that magazine I *still* don't think much of,
think they were failures even by that magazine's standards (which favored,
as Dodie might call it, "seductive surfaces"). But, I don't disrespect the
people who thought enough of them to publish them. The magazine valued a
particular aesthetic, an aesthetic I value today, and I'd supplied them
with work that more or less "worked."
     I picked up the Ern Malley book because Jonathan had given me a great
description of the whole "affair," but also because, at that time,
Jonathan had read me some of "Ern"'s poems, which I actually *liked*. But,
then, my liking them is -- for better or worse -- linked up to the fact
that I know what the poets' intentionality was. I think they failed (well,
obviously) to "expose" the "sham" of "modernism," but I really appreciate
their work, in part, because of I guess you could call it the "high
spirited nature" of the project. The poets were having fun, & the finished
product *is* a lot of fun to read.
     But, of course, Max Harris (_Angry Penguins_'s editor) had no idea
the poems were pranks, was appreciating them by whatever standards he
might have brought to an appreciation of, say, Eliot.  And that does make
me wonder, maybe about Eliot's notion of the "objective correlative" --
I've never thought much of that, and reading Ern Malley's work, which was
accepted not for its "high spirited nature," but for the "seriousness" &
"depth" of the work;  well, I think even less of Eliot's theory (if not
his poetry;  though, admittedly, I don't care much for either).
     When Dodie Bellamy speaks of the "seductive surface" of writing --
well, that's pretty much what Malley's work offers me.  Heck, it's to a
great extent what Shakespeare's sonnets offer me.  I certainly don't
ultimately care whether or not Shakespeare's Sonnets were begun as an
attempt to convince Henry Wriothesley to marry -- though, reading (say)
Robert Giroux's _The Book Known As Q_ does indeed amplify my overall
appreciation for the work. (Even though much of what Giroux says is,
ultimately, speculation.)
     The poets of the Romantic period who valued Thomas Chatterton's hoax
created their own standards for an appreciation of that work, standards
that didn't exist as such in Chatterton's time. Likewise, we live at a
particular point in time wherein people like Jonathan and I (& lots of
others I'll bet) can appreciate the poems of Ern Malley *as* poems, above
& beyond what I'd call the "pre-game hype."
     When Ted Berrigan composed a fake interview with John Cage, & a panel
including Susan Sontag awarded it "Best Interview of the Year" (or
something like that), well, when it came out that the interview had been a
hoax, there wasn't a lot of hullabaloo about that. Likewise, when I
discovered that transcripts of three Japanese "poet/scholars" discussing
Ron Silliman's work and the Japanese tradition of renga in an issue of
_Aerial_ a couple years back was a hoax, I thought no less of the editor
who'd published them. (I myself had enjoyed the transcripts prior to
knowing they were fake.) I agree with Dodie that "the real" is hardly an
easily pinned down thing, "place" or value. "Authenticity" isn't a black &
white issue. I'd bet anyone on this list could, using OULIPO techniques on
found material, come up with a "memoir" that'd win first prize in one of
The Loft's annual contests. (They're a local, very conservative, literary
center.) Likewise, the people at the Loft could probably use whatever
methods to generate a series poems, sign 'em "Charles Bernstein," and get
a number of magazines to publish the stuff *as* Bernstein poems.
     This brings us back, I think, to questions about the ultimate value
of theory -- at least as used by readers as a method of entry into any
particular work. If I determine that Eliot was wrong, that no such thing
as an "objective correlative" exists, does that mean his poetry's
unreadable? I don't think so. If I believe that "objective correlative" is
valid, does that mean that his work is any good? Hardly.
     If "the author is dead," in part by virtue of the fact that one's
"authenticity" is never above question, then, isn't by the same token
*theory* also "dead"?
     What, besides "personal taste" do we -- and I mean collectively --
have left?
     Anything?
     Everything?
     Tom Mandel, even better than your poem "Realism" (in terms of this
topic) is the poem you've just written with Daniel Davidson, _Absence
Sensorium_.  I love it. Would you post some of it for poetics readers, or
at the very least talk a little about how you & Dan generated it? It's
fascinating to me how you used the poem -- which contains a lot of
personal material (as well as, according to Dan, a lot of bogus, made up
autobiography) -- to collapse, each of you, into this singular-voiced
text. Wonderful work.
     Ciao for niao,
     Gary

Hello--

Hope and think I've got this right-- it's a message to Kevin Killian, who
said on poetics something to the effect that "contemporary writers will
be judged on how they responded to the AIDS crisis"-- and also for Dodie
Bellamy, whose work "responds"--

I just wanted to let you know that I taught a series of plague texts at
the end of my humanities class-- response to plagues being the best index of
'humanity' maybe-- and it was the most engaging and emotional
experience.  Boccaccio's DECAMERON back to back with ANGELS IN AMERICA
and Jim Powell's It Was Fever That Made The World.

My students really dove in.  Some of them volunteered time. Anyway I have
been remembering what you said and I wanted to thank you.

Herb's comment of 5/17:

>Who is being tricked, about what, and how much does it matter if the poems

reminds me of a fellow music student during college who could imitate the
voice teacher who was a marvelous mezzo soprano, deliciously proficient at
operatic work.  The student was of the ilk who had raised goofing off to the
level of a fine art.  She took great delight in playing with her Dana
Carvey-like capability in the vocal department.

But all that time, I kept wondering just what it meant that Jill could do
all of this.  What was the difference between her and the vocal teacher?
Many theoretical ones, plus the root versus derivation thing.  But for sound
quality, no diff at all.

I think that when Olson was using the term post the modern, he was
thinking about history, about somethiunbg we could in some terms call
post-historical, or at least histoprical as redefined by his famous
BM lecture.

For the turn of the century Catholic church it seems to have meant,
Modernism, the attempt to gether 19thC science and Darwinism into the
same system with biblical-liturgical teaching. It was condemned by
the Pope, the same Pope who wanted to get the Jews out of Jerusalem.

I'm new to the list, so I thought I'd address a question without
mischief.

It's a question my brother asked Ryan Knighton when we were getting
drunk and having a problem with the really real and what it was and
meant. My brother works with street kids. I think the whole problem
was needlessly abstract for him. He simply asked, "But what do you do
in a crisis?"

Subject:      Absence Sensorium

I don't know how much I want to say about this poem that
no one but Dan and I have seen -- altho I read some
from it at the Poetry Project in January, and I believe
Dan has read part of it aloud too in San Francisco at
some point. Certainly, I can comment on how we were
able to collaborate: I mean that it was made much
easier by the net, in that we sent our work to each
other by email, buyt this is not much of a point
to make. Some of you will know that I make a living
in the networking industry (consulting and selling
internetworking gear and configuration services and
developing information architectures for on-line
implementation - well, I don't actually *do* the
latter but exploit the talents of others [if you
like] and my own conceptual abilities such as they

writing of AS.

I don't think Gary maeant any load on the word
"bogus" when he said that bogus autobiographical
material was part of the poem, but I don't think
it's the rite word - some is imagined, or
someone else's autobiography is sketched, but
most of it is "real," including a lot that might
not be taken as such.

The poem is out being read for publication (at
least I hope it is being read!) and for whatever
reason it feels awkward to say too much about
it and at least a little premature to "print" any
of it here - tho maybe we'd feel differently in
a while, or maybe Dan feels differently than I
right now; I haven't checked and I will.

(ooops I just cut/pasted the same bit twice. shit)


This external description begins to seem a little
silly; I guess I could give you two stanzas, from
different parts of the poem. (just give me a second...)


        finally. But in what ways can these windings
        connect with thought? Beginning
        not as modern but as here, or so says my
        body leaning from this chair.
        Embracing fiction, a functioning desire
        makes for strange and wonderful ceremony,
        like the salve of tongues and language in my ear
...
        A straight score crossed the window
        between the alley and his basement room
        where the pane had been quietly removed. His
        mattress, soaked in blood, twisted off its box spring.
        Interior walls of the rooms were pocked with
        bullet holes, trajected inward. No outward
        facing holes -- the dead don't fire.

and

        Turn and turn it; everything is in it.
        Bridge made of cracked glass whose edge
        defies you to cross. Winter,
        copying in your notebook
        the recipe for a color long unseen
        amid objects glinting on your desk. Yet, know:
        its color may still appear.
 ...
        Is the world still glowing?
        Is the night still making rounds?
        Is something still pushing up ahead of us,
        whittling out the unimaginable?
        I sit here and sip my tea
        the most ordinary act I can think of,
        moon spinning 'round my body.


...

        I can offer no adequate exclusions;
        we all live in the same lie,
        breathe in the same atmosphere.
        So it becomes a question
        of participation and resistance, or
        simply participation.
        I most heartily recommend the former.

        words spoken by someone else
        what sympathies ruled the hunt
        what we heard in confidence, and soon forgot
        whose tongue turned then, or was stopped,
        words slurred, gait canted, spirit spinning awry,
        that it's not our life to rise
        nor ours to fall. Not to listen. Not to speak.



More than a couple....

Yes!  Warhol is really real.  He's the only one that admits art isn't art
unless it has streaks and smudges. Imperfection is the real art of being
artistic. (your recent message)

For me, Warhol's work is sheer surface, utter blank, which (precisely in that
surface blankness) holds many depths for our guesses (i.e., interpretations,
feelings, desires) to plunge into.  His work is empty/ full, impersonal,
machinelike, and very humanly alive/anguished, all at once.  It is facade,
mask, fake, and a multiply-faceted portrait of a consciousness attempting to
come to terms with a singular interpretation of our current situation, a sort
of existential commodification.

I agree that the real can always seem elusive (allusive??), but think that
all our experiences must finally be the Real.  After all they are all we
have, call them what you will.  No need to bring in some notion of a
"transcendent" "Real" as somehow more "real", because that is also
comprehended under our "experience".  We choose the words and the feelings
that we bring to them are ours also.

Dear Tom:

Thanks for that. I hope at some point you will feel more comfortable
talking about the piece en length -- it's a very rare kind of
collaborative poem I think, lots in the first person (& some material in
the second person), and very (this is probably the wrong word too)
"sincere." (No wonder you liked _Locus Solus_ -- a whole HUGE issue
devoted to collaborations!) I hope I didn't put you on the spot asking
you to write about it "prematurely." I'm used to corresponding w/people
who don't get books published, most of 'em, so the notion of "premature"
w/respect to finished work is kind of a foreign one to me. (Dan said that
the version of the poem he sent me was "finished" -- I've read earlier
drafts of it, too.) But, your situation is different, & also, there's
another writer involved, so I'll respect that.

By the above parenthetical, please note that people other than you & Dan
*have* read this; also because I run w/a generally unpublished pack, we
tend to do a lot of "manuscript exchanges" -- meaning, er, um, I believe
maybe there're a few *others* ('sides me) who've read _AS_ as well. (Oh,
now, I'm sure they'll be buyin' the book version too, when it comes out.
I definitely will.)

"Bogus" not at all loaded. I use a lot of bogus autobiographical material
myself, & not because I have any Big Ideas about identity blurring, but
because sometimes the bogus stuff *is* "real." (I'm from California, Tom;
thus "bogus.") (Dude.)

Yours,

Gary

Dear John:

Your take on Warhol sounds very much like Carter Ratcliff's (a wonderful
poet, by the way; just picked up his _Fever Coast_ at Woodland Pattern).
Ratcliff wrote one of those Abbeville Moderns or Contemporaries or
Whathaveyous on Warhol -- check it out if you've not yet seen it. You'll
like, I think.  Gold cover, w/a Marilyn repro.

Dear Reginald:

I work at the Legal Aid Society of Minneapolis/Housing Discrimination Law
Project. The people who come into our office for help/advice are living
in public housing, most receiving various forms of welfare/General
Assistance/SSI benefits. When I began working there, I assumed there was
little correlation between my writing/editing life and the lives of
either the people who came in for help, or the lawyers who help them deal
with various issues of the law. I assumed that existence for these people
was not "needlessly abstract" in the way poetry, writing & theory can be.

Not one of the people who comes into our office isn't in
what most of us on this list (or anyone) would call "a crisis." Being
locked out of their apartments (life or death in winter in Minnesota). Being
denied benefits they need in order to purchase food. Being turned away
from housing because of race, disability, etc.

Not "needlessly abstract"? I was wrong.

These people's lives, the issues they are (at the time they
come in to us) dealing with aren't at all simple, nor can they be solved
(typically) by any simple means. Because most of what Legal Aid offers
people is *advice* (as opposed to representation, which is saved for only
those cases which might seemingly "drag on" in court), and because this
advice, being able to act on this advice, requires a clear understanding of
what tend to be "needlessly" abstract as well as complexly verbose laws,
I'd hesitate to ever suggest that these people do not, in times
of crisis, have to deal with "needlessly abstract" issues.

I'd say, in fact, that these people, perhaps because their crises tend to
be more let's say "immediate" than the crises poets & writers face (or
create or ourselves), they tend to deal w/"needlessly abstract" issues
incredibly well -- they have to, otherwise, they're even worse off.

Life -- at no level -- is simple. & that ain't something I read about in
any book.

Yours,

Gary

The Rescissions Bill (rescinding large parts of last year's
Federal; budget, including massive cuts in aid to college students,
environmental enforcement, etc.) is now before the President.
**IT INCLUDES A PROVISION CALLED THE "SALVAGE" RIDER" THAT REQUIRES THE SALE
OF SIX BILLION BOARD FEET OF LUMBER FROM THE NATIONAL FORESTS IN THE NEXT
TWOP YEARS, AND PROHIBITS ALL COURT CHALLENGES AND NULLIFIES ALL
ENVIRONMENTAL-PROTECTION LAWS THAT MIGHT PREVENT THIS DESTRUCTION.**
The White House has said the President is considering vetoing the bill,
partly because of this provision. The White House has added this issue as
Question # 2 on its daily opinion survey. There follow simple instructions
for calling the White House -- a 15-second call, unless you want to talk to a
live person -- to register your opinion on this.

The White House has now added the "salvage" rider to the list of questions
for
which they are conducting a survey.
This question is number 2 in a series.  YOU CAN NOW CALL THIS LINE
24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.  CALL IMMEDIATELY,
ASK YOUR FAMILY AND NEIGHBORS TO CALL.  REGISTER YOUR
VOTE!

                        (202) 456-1111

After this number answers, you press (1)
and (1) to enter the survey (listen to the operator and respond).  After
the first question, the second question will be on the timber "salvage"
rider.  You will be asked if you support the rider (hell, no!) or oppose
the rider (press 2).  If you call between 9-5 M-F, East Coast time, you
can also stay on the line and at any time in the survey, press O for an
operator (chance to record a vote in the mechanical survey and talk to a
real person).  If this message sounds confusing, don't worry, once you try
it, you'll find it is really very easy, and takes only 10-15 seconds of
your time, once you are connected.

     REMEMBER, THIS LINE IS OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY, SO YOU NO
       LONGER HAVE TO WAIT FOR EAST COAST BUSINESS HOURS

       Don't give up!

       ONLY YOU CAN CONVINCE THE PRESIDENT TO VETO THE
             RESCISSIONS BILL--AND THE TIMBER RIDER

                           CALL NOW!
And please forward this message wherever you can.

The parenthetical statement in second to last paragraph of post to
Reginald Johanson should read "(or create *for* ourselves)."

Also, Reginald: I can't emphasize enough how wrong (not to mention
condescending) it is suppose the poor are a "simple lot." I know you
didn't mean anything bad by it, but then, I'm sure none of the writers
who've created "simple" poor (or working class) characters out of
"pity" "nostalgia" "romanticism" or whatever (& they always seem
"symbolic" of something, don't they?) meant anything bad by it, either.
The poor are just like you & me, Reg, they just have a lot less money.

But don't take my word for it. Read Dambudzo Marechera's _Mindblast_ or
Bob Kaufman's _Solitudes Crowded with Loneliness_ if you think life at the
(economic) bottom is simple or that people who find themselves
(temporarily or permanently) "there" have less going on in their skulls
(or read any less) than Harold Bloom or whoever, Raymond Carver et al. to
the contrary.

Okay. I'll shut up now.

A response without malice: you'd be surprised.  Beyond the usual
undergraduate rejections of her work as being devoid of labor, war and
sex (!), there are the new and unusual readings which move the peripheral
detail of, for instance, the sugar plantations in Antigua which fuel the
local economy to the center of _Mansfield Park_.

BTW, I didn't intend that message for the whole list-- the one about
plagues! But I did mean what I said.  Partly it was triggered by hearing
an emotional reading from Powell's book _It was Fever That Made The World_.

And I, of course, was taken in by these same folks in their translation
of an imagined poet in the Conjunctions "translation" issue -- the
Japanese follower of Spicer & Barthes -- even posting an enthusiastic
note here (which I think Luigi-Bob may have reprinted in Taproot). But
it doesn't erase the fact that these are genuinely interesting poems,
regardless of their ambiguous relation to "authenticity."

How does this differ from, say, someone like Curtis Faville in the
1960s who would do a flawless "take" on anyone (Stanzas for an Evening
Out remains a pretty great book, even tho in some ways it's an
anthology of Curtis' own enthusiasms, a "reading" in Dahlen's sense of
the word of the poetry of that time)?

I saw the big Warhol retrospective at the Chicago Art Institute a few
years back and was taken with how well his work has stood up over time,
whereas Rauschenberg seems to me as dated as Life Magazine covers from
the 1950s, utterly limited and only of historical interest. Warhol
remains not only the most political artist of his generation, but
surprisingly one most committed to visual values in his work. My guess
is that it will still look pretty damn great in another 50 years, when
all the media hype will have faded.

Subject:      Re: The REAL Ern Malley

Just to concur with Ron Silliman re: Stanzas for an Evening Out
by Curtis Faville. A kind of NY school ne plus ultra, in
which the poet writes himself into a corner with paint that
'll never dry. Curtis Faville wrote no more (unless I'm
wrong: anyway, it shd read "has written").

I guess too that the news (just reached me; always the last one
unless it's abt gadgets or cars, then I'm the first one - and
I recommend my methods) of the imaginariness of that Japanese
Spicer-following personally-blistered avantgardist poet whose
family died in a-bomb blast doesn't take away from the interest
of the poems - imagined poems by imagined poet - but it does
give one a slightly lugubrious sense of the imaginers' character
given the material they used.

well, of course it made two lines (in three sentences) instead of three.
you may have noticed that ed's 3 liners often wrap around to 4 or 5.
the subject heading is a clue as to who really wrote it. I didn't.

Dodie, I hope you'll forgive us for continuing to use the word "Real"
in subject headings, despite our knowledge that it freaks you out, what
with your book title & all. (& it's a wonderful book, I think.) But, you
know, taking the word for your title doesn't take the word out of
circulation otherwise -- & I can't imagine you'd believe that'd ever
happen, anyway ...

Ron & Tom, please, please, could one or either of you (or anyone else
w/the goods) please deliver more in re: Curtis Faville? The publisher of
his _Stanzas_? The year it was published? More about the work? What
little's been said about him has got my fingers all itchin', & when my
fingers are all itchin' ... well, I'll leave the rest to imagination.

The Japanese poet/scholar hoax: Well, Tom, I think you're right to
question the hoaxer's character. I don't know the hoaxer myself, but I've
heard (from a friend of his) that the hoax was *racially* motivated:
specifically, this guy decided he could get things published more easily
in the States if he came up with an "ethnic" persona to attach to the
work. Assuming the person who told me that ain't lyin', it is indeed
troubling.

It is true that, at least as far as nonprofit presses go (ones
that rely heavily on grants for continued operation), manuscripts by
otherwise unknowns who have Asian or Hispanic or Native American sounding
names are going to get pulled from the slush pile for immediate consideration
 -- the publicly supported arts, including funding orgs, largely in
response to public pressure, practice a kind of affirmative action. But,
what the hoaxer didn't seem to take into consideration was *why*
affirmative action's being practiced, what lead to that: specifically,
the fact that very few presses (especially smaller & independent ones)
publish people they don't know (either personally, or as in "have heard
of"). And anglos tend to know mostly other anglos.

To me, the hoaxer has proven nothing we didn't already know; and not only
that, has shown himself to be either unaware of (or unsympathetic to) larger
social issues. This doesn't mean that his poems are no good, or
uninteresting, but that yes, Tom, this specific instance is a
particularly troubling one; while I feel no disrepect for the editors (or
readers) taken in by the hoax (being again one of the readers taken in),
my feelings w/respect to the hoaxer -- assuming, again, that my source
for this info about his motives ain't lyin' (& who knows?) -- is quite
another story.

Yours,

Gary

        I've done a couple studies on Warhol and I am totally amazed by
his ability to manipulate.  His art goes beyond the silkscreen.  He was a
business man first and then an artist.  He did 100 portraits of German
business men and their families for $25 000 each which he admits were not
art.  Along the same line he made the Skull serious as a pure fluke and
everybody raved about his genius. ( in case anyone does know the print he
took a photo of a skull and the shadow produced was in the shape of a
baby's head)  He did prints to bring home the bacon to support the " family"
and then he did "art"
        What I admire is Interview, it is or was one of the
greatest entertainment magazines.  Andy was a sort of Martha Stewart of the Pop
generation; he sold a lifestyle.  He told us what was hip and cool and
made Studio 54 and the Factory places we'd died to go to.
Even his work in film and video was incredibly influential and
revolutionary for the time.  The Philosophies of Andy Warhol is one of my
favorite books, it doesn't matter that he didn't write it, he thought of
it, and that's enough.

Ron, I agree that Warhol'l definitely be remembered (& thought & spoken
highly of) for a long, long time. But Rauschenberg ... "dated"? "Utterly
limited"? "Only of historical interest"?

Dude. That is like, totally bogus. I mean, ruhlly. Reminds me of when the

him "You go check this shit out, man?" replied: "Oh, that's just 60s

Anyway, that stuff about the Rausch-man, them's fightin' words! But,
fortunately for you, I smoke too much, & you could easily keek mah ass if
it came down to that. (I do plan to quit, tho, & when I do, I'll have
lots of pent-up energy to release ...)

Looking back at yesterday's post about poetic hoaxes, in my haste to
delete a couple of sentences that mentioned my back channel correspondent
without permission, I also deleted Araki Yasusada's name, but yeah, that's
who we'd been discussing, the same "poet" brought up by Gary Sullivan,
Ron Silliman, and Tom Mandel.

I still don't have the details entirely straight.  Clearly the post-WWII
Japanese avant garde group is fake, but I've also been told that the trio
of contemporary Japanese writers who "translate" the poems are also fake
and the whole thing is the work of one person.

Does anyone have more information on this?

Sheila Murphy's music school anecdote reminds me of some recent legal
landmarks in intellectual property law.

In the late sixties or early seventies, Goodyear Tire asked Nancy Sinatra
if they could use her recording of <These Boots Are Made for Walkin'> in a
TV ad.  She declined and they hired someone who sounded just like her.
Nancy Sinatra sued and lost, she hadn't written the song and had no
ownership rights.

In the 1980s, Pontiac, I think, asked Bette Midler if they could use her
recording of <Do You Wanna Dance> in a TV ad.  She declined and they hired
someone who sounded just like her.  Bette Midler sued and won, because her
vocal style was recognized as her artistic property which had been
infringed.

Of course, we all know many other, far more creative, uses of other people's
material.  But it's interesting to note the laws pertaining to these
issues aren't made by people know or care about the history of collage
and artistic appropration.

Dodie, I think we're in agreement on the elusiveness of the Real.
And gazing on that vanishing point is definitely a drug-like
experience! In fact, your mention of drugs puts me in mind of
one of my favorite passages from Bernstein's _Artifice of
Absorption_, where he says
        poetry does have a mission to be as powerful as
        the strongest drug, to offer a vision-in-sound
        to compete with the world we know so that we can find
        the worlds we don't.
Interestingly, he goes on to say that "there are no limits
language cannot reach," which to me is another way of confirming
that language *does* have limits (all of which can be reached).
What lies beyond those limits? Perhaps Duchamp's "labyrinths
outside of space and time."

with him daily, and Jack confirms that Larry is doing fine.  But you
did pick up the tone/mood all too well.  The sadness, elegy, tragedy
creeping into these poems has to do with my father, who is 68, a year
older than Larry, and is dying of leukemia.  I will be going out to
California (Carmel) in a couple of weeks to be with him.  Larry's
poems, which I've liked for quite some time, helped me out.  And I
suppose that Larry's work--its ability to enact quick shifts of mind,
almost word by word--is for me familiar and kin.  I've been working
in a ten-line form for nearly a year now, and I find myself
re-examining poets who have done well with a short line
form--Creeley, of course, but lots of others, Niedecker, Plath,
Oppen, Dickinson, Susan Howe--and went back to Larry's Selected Poems
(1968?).  In my group of four, #2 begins with two lines from Larry's

I'm sorry if this is unwarranted, but it seems Gary and Reg are
discussing, or positing, two discssions bound by a gap.  I'm not
sure if Reg was implying anything about class situation and the
abstract.  When REg and his brohter and I were having this chat,
his brother was essentially asking me if, in a crisis of some kind,
like the fact i"m losing my vision, I take my theories about
the page and poem and apply them elsewhere in my life.  The fact
that he works with street kids was incidental.
Or maybe I'm missing to what Gary was responding.  Gary?

Are practices too diverse to be generalized about or is there a sense in
which we can describe something--roughly or not equivalent to
pomo--without using the term we feel should be scrapped?

Forgive me for editing the comments as I have done . . . .  I am
intrigued by this discussion of the real, but must insist upon my earlier
statement that The Real Can Be Simulated.  I'm thinking of an anecdote or
an example of this . . . but in the mean time . . . doesn't John's post
suggest . . . albeit in my own twisted reading of it . . . that there is
the possibility that are experiences are not necessarily the real?  It's
this possibility that I believe opens the door for simulations of the
real, even the replacement of the real by simulations.  I'm trying to
think of an example . . . a Baudrillard-sort of example . . . any
suggestions?

I guess I have, over the years, heard writers and books reviled for
not writing about what they didnt write about. It doesnt make sense
to me. I get the picture of a person who is interested in, say, labor
struggle, condemning books that were not about labor struggle. Of
course, I am interested in baseball, and so I started reading Jerome
Charyn, and Fee Dawson.

I still dont really know how Marxism can be a theory used to apply to
literature. I can see how it can be used to discuss economics, and
that one might, in writing about economics, have a chapter about the
economics of book-publishing, or economics as visioned in a novel.
But is a Marxist reading of Pound any more sensible than an Imagist
reading of the Politburo?

Subject:      real classist assumptions

Gary--it seems that in responding to my brothers question, or the
framing of that question, I have been mistook. Thanks Ryan for
clarifying, but that's not completely it either. I don't really have
anything to say about the "poor" one way or another. I thought the
detail about my brother's profession was relevant because the
debate--and I know I'm a late comer to it so excuse the
presupposition--only rarely touched on those moments when the real is
constellated so powerfully that there is no opportunity for
reflection, only action, response. And in those moments the Hamlet
question about real or not real does, in fact, seem needlessly
abstract. Those are the moments of definition, of consequence, after
which there is no going back. These are moments in which class is
irrelevant. I interpreted my brother's question as coming out of his
work because I happened to know, from other conversations with him,
that when he deals with people in crisis he is dealing with people
who have staked a great deal on a notion of the real, and that that
stake is often a matter of life and death. If we survive our initial
investment in a notion of the real, we can go back and evaluate it.
IF we survive. And so the question is still the same: what do you DO
in a crisis?

Subject:      postpostmodernism

        I like the fact that there is a word "postmodernism": it figures
forth the possibility that there might be significant, systemic differences
between our time--our culture(s), our attitude(s) toward history--and that of,
say, Oscar Wilde.

        I say "might be," though: postmodernity stands for me as a possibility,
not a fact.  For one thing, as we've seen, when one tries to date its inception,
it recedes.  I think the latest is 1847?  How about the French Revolution, come
to that?  (Just kidding: revolution itself seems pretty much a modern thing.)
More importantly, it eludes precise definition, or at least we don't agree on
one.

        So I'll continue to use the term, all due respect to Marjorie Perloff
to whom very much respect indeed is due, all the while admitting that I/we
don't know for sure whether it names something (here comes the kicker:) real.
It's important to keep admitting the extent of our ignorance, to whatever small
extent we can really know it--oxymoron intended.

        Bruno Latour has written interestingly on this topic.  He argues that
_We Have Never Been Modern_ in the sense that what he calls "the constitution
of modernity" is itself unworkable, and "modern" people have always adhered
partly to premodern constitutions anyway.  Consistency, or as some have put
it, hideous purity, has never been imperative in such matters *except*
according to the (bogus) modern constitution.  Of course, if there is "really"
no modernity, where does that leave POSTmodernity?  Ans: Limbo limbo lim-BO.
Do we contradict ourselves?  Very well.

        Concepts of this type are tools.  If J-F Lyotard or Charles Olson or
Pope Homogeneous III invents a nail gun, does that "contradict" hammers?
Ridiculous notion.  Nor does it prevent someone from using the flat of a
monkey wrench to drive nails.  Just so the work gets done.  Does confused and
sometimes contradictory wondering about our place in history get anything
accomplished?  Poets and fictioneers had better hope so.  It's part of our job.

What is a great work of art.
What is visual value.
Are great works of art those works which are considered to be great works
of art.
Why are some works of art great and other works of art not great.

I tire quickly of Warhol, quickly of Rauschenberg. They seem the death of
the 50s and 60s to me. Am I wrong.
Am I wrong to not recognize a great work of art as a great work.
Could it be that "great" is problematic in this context.

Perhaps one needs to look further at art and then at aesthetic systems.
Perhaps I need gusto.

Everyone has favorites. For me, nothing beats Sue Williams or Jenny
Holzer at the moment, her Lustmord. But I wouldn't know about great.

Oh, I'm on this one: Martha Stewart, if I'm not mistaken, is a writer of
cookbooks (or is it gardening? or both) and she's become something of a
icon for a particular generation (who shall go nameless).  She's also
made the transition to public television.  Catch me if I'm wrong.'

Is it cookbooks from Martha Stewart? I thought she was some arbiter,
somewhere between the middle class & the very rich, of taste in interior
design and furnishings. But my sense is admittedly murky on this point. I
did once see a television commercial in which she had cut up credit cards
(American Express) & put them back together, mosaic-like, at the bottom of
a swimming pool. Very real.

Ha.  That's great, an Imagist reading of the Politburo.  I'd see it
something along the lines of WCW's poem about the firetruck and the
number five . . . I don't recall the poem's title (The Great Figure? hm):

I saw a red star
Upon the granite spire


something like that . . .

Dear Jeff,

I agree that simulated experiences are as "real" as "real" experiences.  We
could also agree that our "real" experiences are "simulated"; i.e.,
"simulations" of events in some sense "external" to our "experience".  This
is getting deep into the intertwining convolutions of epistemology & ontology
& definitions of terms, though.

Best,

--ya, in this instance i take issue to that. my recent rethinking of the
duchamp ready-made, dada over all, has caused me to re-examine warhol's
work. i've always felt the relation between he and warhol profound. i
wish i could go on abt that right now, but am in a rush. i'd like to
come back to this tomorrow

for me, CARL ANDRE is still the most important sculptor of our time. but
that's a completely personal opinion. well, sort of. he's really had a
big influence on me and my critical thinking

Netcom is $19.95 per month for all you can eat, full internet access &
40 hours of free "prime time" (M-F, 9:00 AM to midnight) that I never
once have come close to using up (but then I'm most often up and doing
this, like now, at 6:00 AM). Don't pay by the message or the MB!

Maybe Tom could "back channel" us who want to read the whole thing.

Subject:      Re: Curtis Faville

Stanzas for an Evening Out were (was?) published by L Publications
(Curtis' own press, which also brought out the Blue is the Hero,
Berkson's selected poems) in both hard and paperback in 1977. 203
pages. I think that Small Press Distribution may still carry it.
Otherwise, Faville lives in Kensington (just north of Berkeley, tho
technically part of Contra Costa county), works in SF for the Social
Security Administration in a job he's had for 20 years at least,
although there was a break in there as his wife was in Japan for a few
years.

Faville was a Berkeley student who, like Watten, went to Iowa at
Grenier's behest around 1970. He published L magazine there for awhile
before coming back to the Bay Area. He's always avoided readings like
the plague (and poets, generally, finding them flawed in ways that
poems presumably aren't).

Lyn published a second, smaller collection called (I think)
Wittgenstein's Door (an allusion to LW's attempt as an architect for
his sister's house, a phenomenon that Faville seems to have followed in
designing his own home with the aid of the fellow who wrote A Pattern
Language). I don't think he's written in at least a decade.

Faville is such a chameleon in his writing that it's difficult to pick
a characteristic sample, but here are two short ones to give a flavor:

POEM

What is a pause
before the cause ceases
to be a river. It is

never the muscle of
ARM & HAMMER BAKING SODA.
America was a horse.

****

IOWA

Prehistoric
farm
collection.


The fussiness of that final period is an absolutely identifiable
Favillism, come to think of it. There's a long poem in the book,
"Aubade," which may be the best Schuyler poem that Jimmy never wrote.
When I was editing In the American Tree, Faville's "critiques" of other
poets in his poems was something I thought about including long and
hard. If that book was one poet thicker, Faville would have been it.

Andrew,
I enjoyed the lovely way the words you quoted

stuck.  How is poetry druglike - and how on
earth does it open up worlds?

I've gone right off greatness and insight and

wanted to appear that way.

Subject:      Who you are in a crisis
In-Reply-To:  <199505190143.SAA06990@mailhost.primenet.com>

Dear Reginald:

Many thanks for your clarification of your brother's question. I'm sorry
I misread it; there wasn't much to go on -- what I read was a leap
between "works with street kids" and "what do [we] do in a crisis?" &
from there, began projecting, mainly things *I* used to think. My
apologies (very real) for then being Mr. Preacherman.

Anyway, the question, as you've reframed it, is an excellent one.

I don't think there is any one answer to the question "what do you do in
a crisis" -- even postulating the same crisis across the board for a
number of "fairly similar" people. I also am not convinced that, at that
moment, you're not w/out speculation, even "theory."

Here's an anecdote, though maybe inappropriate given that it wasn't quite
as immediate as having a gun to the head (though it was similar). My wife
& I, on our honeymoon (in Brooklyn -- a lover's paradise) were on a rush
hour subway train that suddenly stopped, & then the driver came over the
intercom to tell us there was a fire on the tracks ahead & that he was
"shutting off the air." Almost immediately after that, the tunnel filled
with black smoke, and people from the car in front of us began to force
their way (difficult, as crowded as it was) into our car. As they did
that, smoke began pouring into our car. People began screaming,
panicking, some praying. More smoke poured into the car & it got to the
point where we couldn't breathe. I can't describe the looks on people's
faces. I "knew" we were going to die, and the first image that popped
into my head was of the friends we were staying with, and realizing THEY
DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE DOWN HERE. The second image was of all of us in the
train, lying in heaps on each other, dead -- the "thing" whoever first
reached us would find. I began to scream to Marta that I loved her, over
and over. I'm an atheist. I don't believe in life after death. But I do
believe in love. And I loved -- and still do love -- Marta very, very
much. So, at that moment, what became important to me was that she *know*
that I loved her, that she had *been* loved. I felt that Marta had a kind
of "object permanence" problem, that even though she'd married me, she
didn't *really* believe I'd love her, be there, our whole lives together.
So, it became crucial to me to GET THIS INFO ACROSS TO HER. It was
physically impossible to hold her (too many people, crammed in) or to
somehow PHYSICALLY impart this "information," so I used language,
screamed over & over "I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU!" Then, it became impossible
to scream any more, & I basically just resigned myself to death -- which
itself didn't seem like such a bad thing at that moment. Or, that was the
scenario I was playing in my head. Marta tells me that, after I stopped
screaming "I LOVE YOU!" I began screaming sort of a coarse, hoarse noise
of some kind -- which I don't at all remember doing.

It was a crisis, and some of what I did during that crisis, I did
based on earlier (& immediate, actually) thought, speculation, opinion,
& theory. I don't know if this is an appropriate anecdote w/respect to
your brother's question, because I didn't feel that there was any way
"out" of the situation, that we had any options. Everyone on the train
basically just waited the situation out, covering their faces with
scarves, some passing out, a couple of people died. (Two, I think.)

I didn't bring any speculation about "poetry" to this event, but I did
bring (I think) a belief in the power of language, which is obviously
related. If I had come to that situation with a complete disillusionment
or mistrust of language, I don't think I'd have tried to get Marta to
believe that I loved her by merely *saying* it. (Would I, if I didn't
believe in the power -- or ability? -- of language, have believed in love?)

I say this based only on the above experience, but I think it's
interesting that, when faced with death, the need to "communicate" (or
"connect" if you're uncomfortable w/"communicate") became THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING TO DO. Which is no different than my "every day" life,
writing, reading, & publishing. (Or, for that matter, as a secretary/
receptionist at the L.A.S.)

Yours,

Gary

to quote my roommate "Martha is the guru of easy living".  She will aid
you in all your fine dining, decorating and entertaining needs.  She has
packaged a beautiful lifestyle and feeds it to the public in her tasteful
magazine Martha Stewart's Living.  She is every housewife's nightmare,
but I love her.

Don't tell anybody, but at Christmas we used her recipe for turkey

X-cc:         Ron Silliman <rsillima@ix.netcom.com>

I've been borrowing Ron Silliman's Ketjak from Cris Cheek (ah poetry
as contraband, I'm sending this message from Cris' account because I'm
handing the book back personally, in best hand-delivered condition) and
*adoring* it. I'd already read Tjanting, What and Paradise with great
pleasure and stimulation, but Ketjak is mindblowing, elegant in design,
perfect in minute detail. So, cutting to the chase, could anyone sell me
or swap me a copy? In return for the effort, here is a brainteaser: is
there one (the only one I could find) proof-reading error in the following
sentence, or is there some lyricism sneaking in....:

"When Zukofsky debuted Reich's Violin Phase on the west coat, the first
person to stomp out was Mario Savio" (Ketjak, p.21)

For anyone who doesn't know, sentences from earlier paragraphs nearly
always get repeated (sometimes fascinatingly revised) in later paragraphs
in the book. In this case, the sentence appears without the possible typo,
only as

"The first person to stomp out, when Zukofsky debuted Reich's Violin Phase
in the west, was Mario Savio" (p40).

Was this use of the word coat "for" coast" especially put in, as a
deliberate apparent mistake, for the attentive to notice?

Anyone have a copy, though?

Subject:      more on Ketjak
X-cc:         i.lightman@uea.ac.uk

I'm back at Cris Cheek's terminal, with a few more words about Ketjak,
which I've now read through to the end - apologies if anyone's posted
about it since I last posted, I don't know how to retrieve new mail
on this machine!
        Just noting a few more features of this wonderful book.

First, I saw another possible typo reading today in Cris' car, but
didn't have a pen (it was around p.55-60), thought I'd marked the page
with a train ticket, but now can't find the typo. However the page I'd
marked I had to re-read thoroughly, and only by this aleatoric reading
accident did I discover the occurrence of the sentence "Revolving
door" in *mid-paragraph*, on p.61. As even cursory readers of Ketjak
will know, "revolving door" is the sentence that usually begins each
paragraph of the book - yet this means that the book rebels against
its own system and again tests the alertness of the reader. Moreover,
two big sentences recur *within* the last paragraph, even after this
occurrence of the "revolving door" sentence, thus breaking the system of
having sentences recur *once* from paragraph to paragraph, ie breaking
the parallelism of paragraphs or indeed the pattern that makes a
paragrah a paragraph eg "let a paragraph, in Ketjak, be a collection
of sentences that includes one of each of the sentences of a previous
paragraph, sometimes reworked, plus new sentences new to the book so far";
this rule is also broken early, as not all the sentences from an earlier
paragraph recur in the next paragraph every time.

Oh, the big sentences that recur within the last paragraph, after, as
far as I've noticed the last (buried) incidence of the sentence "revolving
door" are:

"Dark brown houseboats beached at the point of low tide - men atop their
cabin roofs, idle, play a dobro, a jaw's harp, a 12 string guitar -
only to float again when the sunset is reflected in the water of
Richardson bay" (p.63)

"Dark brown houseboats beached at the point of low tide - men atop their
cabin roofs, shirtless and in overalls, idle, play a dobro, a jaw's harp,
a 12 string guitar - only to float again when the sun is reflected
in Richardson bay" (p.68)

AND

"We stopped for hot chocolate topped with whipped cream and to discuss
the Sicilian Defense" (p.63)

"We stopped for hot chocolate topped with whipped cream, and to discuss
the Sicilian Defense" (p.72)

        I also really like the way that the paragraphs don't expand
uniformly, they sometimes contract, as do the sentences that recur. I
also like the way that the system is broken sometimes by making the
base not only number/formalism, but also, more "conventionally",
imagism and poetry of place. One of the first sentences to appear is,
for example, "fountains of the financial district" and then "fountains
of the financial district spout"; this then gets returned to not always
as a *sentence* but as a *description*; there are later sentences where
is described someone passing a fountain, or through a financial district,
just as there are many different sentences describing refuse collectors
and coastal Bay Area scenes. In other words there isn't the initially
likely-looking structure of "let a paragraph of Ketjak only include
sentences that do not add together at all as a description of a scene",
which Ron brilliantly argues is an automatism and fetish on the part of
most idle paragraph and sentence makers, in _The New Sentence_, which
must be resolutely avoided in order to draw attention to its
omnipresence; in Ketjak, Ron both does draw attention to the sentence
and the paragraph, but does also "lapse", which is tinglingly exciting,

purist or systematic-to-the-point-of-missing-an-opportunity.

"Stood there broke and rapidly becoming hungry, staring at nickels
and pennies at the fountain's bottom." (p.58)

"We walked through the financial district at midnight, the street
deep between these buildings , a film crew working down an alley,
artificial twilights, pausing as we passed to stare at great
tapestries in bank lobbies" (p.59)

"The fountain forms a geometry of the particular, five waterfalls,
six spouts, all of which arrive in the general pool" (p.66)

"I sat atop the fountain, which, at midnight, was shut off, all
concrete and still pools of water" (p.87)

"The tenor sax is a toy" (p.60 and throughout)

"The tenor sax is a phallus or cross" (p.92 - penultimate page in the
book - pathos in concluding moment of Silliman book, read linearly,
scandal! NOT!)

        I don't want to detract from the incredible abstract skill with
the sentence per se in Ketjak, trying out everything, trying out
wonderful sonic patterns and artificial hilarious rhymes - it is moment
by moment really fulfilling to read, for versatility and for detail
of observation -
        Sorry to write a rave review twenty years after composition
date and seventeen after publication date, but I just wanted to supplement
my endorsement of the (I think, affectionate) recent Alt.fan.silliman
adventure with some detailed appreciation - and also to demonstrate
the qualities of a work that is formal and experimental but also human
and non-programmatic - to show what I think is the unbudgeable and
unignorable sea-change that stereotyping and ignoring the actual works of
"Language Writers" (as, as I've said - and now got into trouble for in
Cambridge and London [people have blanked or eyeballed me at events] - ,
avant-garde British poetry is doing) ignores, making for ignorance.

Subject:      CFP--1995 Sixties Generations Conference

                    !!!CALL FOR PAPERS!!!


            1995 SIXTIES GENERATIONS CONFERENCE

             An Interdisciplinary Conference of
               Scholars, Activists and Artists

                     October 5-8, 1995

            Western Connecticut State University
                    Danbury, Connecticut


                Proposals due: July 15, 1995


I invite you to join us for the third annual Sixties Generations Conference:
From Montgomery to Viet Nam on October 5-8, 1995.  Last year over 400 scholars
and students joined us at Western Connecticut State University to hear  more
than one hundred presentations by academics, activists, and artists.  The
Sixties Generations Conference is a showcase for intelligent and lively academic
work in a variety of disciplines and studies fields, but what makes it special
is the interdisciplinary emphasis and the collegial atmosphere.  We've
demonstrated that mixing academics with artists, crossing disciplines, and
spanning generations fosters a creative and collaborative excitement that can't
be matched.  Our evaluation forms showed that over 95% of those who attended
last year will be back in 1995.  Here are some comments we received:

    "The Conference provided a rare opportunity to not only learn from
    scholars and artists but to engage in fruitful discussion that
    multiplied the impact of the meetings many times over. The organization
    and administration of the conference was superb and the facilities
    excellent. What was most gratifying was how so many of the scholars and
    artists in their lives and work sought to cut across traditional
    boundaries of gender, academic disciplines, and even of age: there was a

    lively mix of younger students and scholars and well-established
    teachers and professors. I look forward to next year's meeting knowing
    it will be a highlight  of my academic annual activities."

    "The conference was an outstanding mix of scholars, students, artists,
    participants, participant-observers, etc. One could sample informal
    networking and heavy-duty scholarship. The interactions of panels and
    audience was lively and informative.  Keep it up!"

    "I particularly appreciated the interdisciplinary  nature of the
    conference. If not unique, it is extremely rare. Vietnam veterans,
    scholars, antiwar activists, artists, musicians, and writers all
    dealing with the same subject--in a better society, Vietnam
    Generation would be recognized and nurtured as a national resource.

We remain committed to interdisciplinary work and to seeking diverse
presentations. We particularly encourage the participation of those
traditionally under-represented in academic discourse, and we do not shrink
from controversial topics.  In addition to soliciting work from traditional
disciplines, we enthusiastically invite presentations in African American
Studies, Chicano Studies, Women's Studies, Native American Studies and other
studies programs.

This year we have broadened our international perspective. Grants from the Ford
Foundation and the Asia Resource Council have enabled us to arrange the
attendance of three Vietnamese scholars at the 1995 conference.  Duong Tuong is
Viet Nam's leading art critic and the translator of Gone With the Wind and other
modern American fiction; he is currently working on translations of Flannery
O'Connor.  He was associated with Ha Noi's "Prague Spring," the Literary
Humanism movement of the 1950s.  Hoang Hien is the teacher and critic of Viet
Nam's doi moi  (perestroika) writers. He was the teacher of Bao Ninh and Duong
Tuong, the two Vietnamese war novelists who have published in English in the
U.S.  Huu Ngoc is Viet Nam's senior cultural journalist, formerly editor of the
Foreign Languages Publishing House, author of the first Vietnamese language book
on American civilization.  These scholars were invited to participate by Viet
Nam Generation, Inc. editor Dan Duffy, who has lived and worked in Ha Noi for
nine months setting up our program of translating Vietnamese literature into
English, and Viet Nam Generation publications into Vietnamese.

We know that most of the best work at conferences is done between sessions, when
people get the chance to talk, to share stories, to set up collaborations.  So
we do our best to make sure that there is plenty of time for these activities-we
arrange for meals to be available at the conference site, set up a lounge for
refreshments, and keep coffee and tea available all day long.  We also arrange
evening events--our Sixties style coffeehouse reading was so successful last
year that we will do it again, breaking it up into two nights of poetry,
fiction, multimedia and performance art.

As usual, we are doing all this work on a shoestring.  Viet Nam Generation,
Inc., is a literary and educational nonprofit which cannot yet afford to salary
its staff. This conference has been supported entirely by volunteer efforts,
the registration fees of participants and by our book sales.  The facilities are
generously provided by Western Connecticut State University. We know that many
conferences can afford to waive fees for those presenting papers, but we cannot.
We do waive fees for those who would not otherwise be able to participate, and
we do our best to find alternative housing for those who cannot afford hotel
rooms.  We're committed to the notion that no one should be turned away for lack
of funds.  To meet this goal we rely on support from those who do   have
funds-faculty members or others with full-time positions and decent incomes.  In
fact, we encourage you, if you can afford it, to pay an extra registration fee
to cover someone else with fewer resources.

We also encourage you to subscribe to our journal, Viet Nam Generation, a forum
for interdisciplinary written work on the war.  We publish many of the Sixties
Generations Conference  papers in the pages of the journal, which is now
entering its seventh volume year.  Your support enables us to continue our
efforts.

Part of our philosophy is that we do not rank those who attend the Sixties
Generations Conference-there are no "stars" here; we don't even put your
institution on your name tag.  We have no "keynote" speakers or "special"
sessions.  Those who attend don't do it for their c.v.  They do it-and we do
it-because the work we all do is vital, because we believe in an alternative to
the rest of the deadly dull gatherings which pass for conferences in academia,
and because we are dedicated to building a community of scholars, activists, and
artists who can support each other in our work.

I look forward to seeing you in October.

Marxisms proliferate, due in part to the fact that Marx had a great deal
to offer many interpretive machines.  THere is no one Marxism, and,
indeed, reading Marx's American essays recently, I can say again that
thre might well--as with most of us?--be more than one Marx.

The question of the never-achieved "dictatorship of the proletariat"
is a different kettle of fish.  The recent arguments, about to
turn bloody as soon as Jameson's book on Derrida comes out, about
spectres of Marx and COMMUNISM (site specfic to Eastern Europe, mostly)
seem a kind of prosthesis for more direct and current engagement.

I don't guess this is at all a response to the post to which it is attached.
But I feel a bit steamed by our present (inter) national spiral
into meanness and reaction, and dead guys like Marx can only help
a bit more than vain arguments over which Marxism is correct//WAS possible.

Still, one lives, in a sense by engaging the fight indirectly, poetically.
By the way, I hear that all of Whitman's recently discovered notebooks
are available on-line.  I hear the spectre of Pound screaming for joy.
Oh, my, there are ghosts--and there are ghosts--dancing spectrally in
this machine.

Gary -- don't have any of the info. here at the moment, but there was a
book about "The Spectra Hoax" pub'd some decades ago that lingers in many
libraries;  I seem to remember Yvor Winters or folk of his ilk being
involved -- at any rate, it was a parody of modernist movements that,
like many such parodies, turned out to be be far more interesting as a
phenomenon than anything else the poets involved ever did -- several
"fake" spectrists were created, and their poems appeared in a number of
mags & newspapers before the ruse was revealed --

Subject:      Re: really Real Andy

re: Marvelous Martha, really--

Her teevee show and magazine are titled "Martha Stewart Living";
the "content" is anything from cooking to home furnishing to gardening,
including lots of tips on how to put an old-money veneer on a nouveau-
bourgeois (there--I said it) lifestyle.  Tag line: "It's a *good* thing."

She's easy to despise, except that a lot of those things *are* good,
as such things go.  The latest mag features a troutfishing camping trip
into the wilds of Idaho: pretty pictures, the poop on avoiding hassles with
bears, and, of course, recipes for fresh-caught trout, skillet scones, and on
and on.  Sounds yummy, don't it?

She doesn't come from old money (would someone who did go on TV with it?),
more or less inventing herself and her gig as she's gone along, a Horatio Alger
story for our time.  Impressive, my research on this topic, eh?  Actually
my wife subscribes.

I left the bay area a year or so before the internet craze hit, but
I'd have to agree that paying for mail is pretty unusual. Dunno
who "sirius.com" is, but there has to be a better way than that.
You can get a list of access providers from pdial (let me know;

supply it in the meantime).

Two places I know of to get a list of dial-up services are as follows:

Internic  (because of their address structure I assume they have some
information for providers outside the US)


<ftp://is/internic.net/infoguide/getting-connected/united-states/internic-us-provider-all>

or via web

<http://www.internic.net/internic/provider.html>


or you can try

Providers of Commercial Internet Access (POCIA)  (I don't know if they
have info about providers outside the US.)

<ftp://ftp.teleport.com/vendors/cci/pocia/pocia.txt>

or via web

<http://www.teleport.com/~cci>

or for e-mail, you can send a <blank message> to

<cci@olympus.net>


Both of these lists are organized by telephone area code and include some
information about rates, etc. for most providers in most areas.  There
are cheap providers in most areas, but you often get what you pay for.

I won't go into the problems with my provider, <eskimo.com> which I
assume operates from someone's closet in a suburb north of Seattle. I'll
just say that it is _ridiculously_ cheap.

I hope the above addresses are useful to anyone looking for cheaper and/or
better on-line service.

Bests,

Herb

Yes, and rather confusing too.  I'm interested--as if it hadn't already
been said--in how the real comes to be a sublime category of experience
or, rather, of roping off of experience as unmediated by . . . ideology
or other means of perceiving or creating experience.  I've been reading
Judith Butler's Bodies That Matter recently and am intrigued at her claim
that sex is enunciated and culturally produced--and not essential or
biological.  That producing sexual difference is a way of maintaining
social order.  I'm reducing . . . .  But what is interesting is how the
real is produced as somehow outside of cultural production--much as
Butler suggests sex is--when it is as mediated as any other thing.
Consequently, as John suggests, epistemologically and ontologically these
categories--the real and the simulated--come to stand in the place of
each other (it gets confusing, I know).

Ron,

Rauschenberg couldn't really paint very well (& he certainly couldn't draw in
any academic sense), which may be one reason among many that he took to
assembling junk and then silkscreening all sorts of photos.  But in his
earlier years he could slather a blob of paint so exquisitely on a piece of
canvas that it meant nothing & everything.  Those paint dithers evoke (for me
at least) nothing but the paint, send-ups of ab-ex pieties, assisted
readymades (i.e., he MUST have just found them somewhere), randomness of the
non-human, & both inspired and purposeless play, all at once.  No one else
has managed such blank/full soulfulness in paint smears.

In his later years, of course, his quick laying-on of paint fields among the
silkscreens came to look pretty lame.

Butler's claim reminds me of Foucault's, that "we must not place sex on the
side of reality and sexuality on the side of confused ideas and
illusions...against the machinery of sexuality the strong point of the
counter-attack should not be sex-desire, but the body and its pleasures"
(History of Sexuality Vol. 1, 157).

Subject:      Actually actual?

It might be fruitful to think back to the roots of "real" in the Latin
*res*, or "things".  Now I know Silliman doesn't trust etymology, but I feel
that traces of the original "readings" of words still lurk in the
(back)ground of a historical word's meaning as much as the more current
readings and misreadings of it.
Hiedegger points out in view of this origin that the real is the set of
properties which belong to res, to a thing, whether or not the thing
actually exists.  Reality and actuality are thus not necessarily the same.

I think of reality as being the way actuality is constructed for us, or
expressed by and through us.  The real *as* the actual is that highly
elusive space that Andrew and Dodie have been speaking of, but (I have to
hope) every reality opens out into actuality someplace.

The relation of poetry to the real could be seen then as an attempt to a)
mirror, b)create, c)transform the actual by means of the real.  The poem
establishes some kind of reality which, with varying degrees of "success",
holds open that opening in the reality in which it finds itself, so that the
actual can be beheld.

Also--to Jeffrey Timmons--it might be said here that the real is already a
kind of simulation of the actual (unfortunately, since this assertion is so
abstract, anything could be an example of it, and every example could be
challenged.)

.) In his book "The Concept of Irony with Constant Reference to Socrates"
Kierkegaard
states that irony in its simplest instance is to say the opposite of what
is meant.
The inner and the outer do not  form a harmonious unity, for the external
is in opposition to the internal.

Kierkegaard plots three points which describe the beginning, the middle,
and the end of the career of irony. The first is its inception in the
figure of Socrates. The second is its illusory zenith in the Romantics,
from which Hegel coins his dialectic of opposites (i.e. Romantic Irony).
This is where I would situate Ortega.* And the third is the point at
which irony disappears, having gone through a metamorphosis by way of
experience, resulting in self-mastery.

2.) Published in 1925, Ortega Y Gasset =D5s essay called "The=20
Dehumanization of Art" maintains that among other things, modernism tends=
=20
to " be essentially ironic"

In the section "Doomed to Irony", Ortega continues, "It is not that the=20
content of the work is comical...To look for fiction as fiction, which we=

because it is recognized as farce....Thanks to this suicidal gesture art=20
continues to be art, its self-negation bringing about its preservation=20
and triumph.=D3

Nor is this ironical reflection of art upon itself new as an idea. *In=20

take seriously that very serious person we are when we are not an artist."

And finally Ortega maintains that "to the young generation art is a thing=

#3) Present in all forms of irony is the understanding that the
phenomenon is not the essence, but the opposite of the essence where the
essence is defined as the IDEA or thought and phenomenon is defined as
the medium and in the case of Socrates the rhetorical word.

If, when I speak, I am conscious that what I say is my meaning, and an
adequate expression of my meaning, and if I assume that the person to
whom I am speaking understands perfectly what I have said, then I am
bound by what I have said. That is, I am positively free. Furthermore, I
am bound in relation to myself and cannot detach whenever I wish. This is
an identity.

If, on the other hand, what I say is not my meaning or the opposite of my
meaning, then I am free both in relation to myself and in relation to
others. That is, I am negatively free.

With irony the subject is always seeking to get outside the object and
this is done by becoming conscious, at every moment, that the object has
no reality. The subject constantly retires from the field and proceeds to
talk every phenomenon out of its reality in order to preserve their
negative independence of everything.

With doubt, on the other hand, the subject tries to destroy the
phenomenon in order to get at the essence. The subject seeks to penetrate
the object and the misfortune consists in the fact that the  object
constantly eludes him or her.

It might be said that doubt is for philosophy what irony is for the
personal life. Just as the philosopher claims no true philosophy is
possible without doubt, so one may say that no authentic life is possible
without irony.

One might think that since irony is conscoius of the fact that reality
has no existence, it was a type of religious devotion. In religious
devotion the relationship to the world loses its validity, but only
insofar as the reality of God asserts absolute reality  Irony however, is
nothingness. It  is a deadly stillness that returns to haunt and jest. If
irony is not a type of religious devotion, neither is it a form of
hypocrisy, for hypocrisy belongs to the moral shpere and irony to the
metaphysical.

4.) Irony in terms of the BIG picture differs in quality from the irony
discussed thus far. In this sense irony directs itself against the whole
given actuality or essence of a certain time and situation, which has
become alien for the ironic subject and lost all validity.

Just as the world spirit throughout every age is within itself, so
individuals within an age  must follow the actuality which presents
itself to them. Hegel remarked: " All dialectic accepts as valid what
shall become valid as if it were valid and allows the internal
destruction to develop within it. Such is the universal irony of the
world. " To a certain extent every world historical turning point must
exhibit this formation.

An individual may be world historically justified and at the same time
without authority. And just as his or her lack of authority must make
them a sacrifice, so the fact that they are historically justified makes
them a triumph.  That is to say they triumph by becoming a scarifice.

As the new comes forth we meet three types of individuals:

1. The Prophetic Individual.
2.  The Tragic Hero.
 3. The Ironic Subject.

The prophetic individual does not possess the future but envisages it and
imitates it. He or she cannot assert it because they are lost to the time
in which they live. The tragic hero fights for the new and endeavors to
destroy  what for him is vanishing actuality. The ironic suject displaces
the old and shows us all its imperfections. For him or her the given
actuality, having lost its validity, has become an imperfect form where
everything constrains.  The ironic subject does not work hand in hand
with their age, like the prophet, but rather has advanced beyond it and
opened up a front against it. That which shall come is hidden from him or
her.

5.) Just as historical actuality is a criteria in Kierkegaard's concept
of irony, so too is actuality for the individual. In so far as the
individual remains ironic he or she is negatively free and thus,
unassimilated into a larger context and unable to feel the responsibility
of consequences, the ironic subject is unable to fulfil his or her task
as an acting individual.

The last stage in the life of irony is when its truth is revealed as the
mastered moment. Shakespeare is considered the great master of irony.
There is neither too much nor too little, so everything receives its due.
Irony is not present at some particular point in the poem, but
omnipresent in it, so that visible irony in the poem is ironically
mastered. This renders both the poet and the poem free. However, because
a poet is successful in mastering irony in the moment of artistic
production does not mean he has mastered irony in actuality.

Usually the personal life of an artist does not concern us in regard to
his or her work, but in the case of irony it is of some relevance. If an
artist steps outside the label of genius, they will become, in some
measure a philosopher. In which case their work will not have a mere
external relation to him or herself, but rather the artist will see in a
particular work, a moment of their own development.

It was in this respect that Goethe's life as a poet was so great. For
Goethe irony was, in the strictest sense, a mastered moment, a spirit
ministering to the world.

Once it has been mastered, irony undertakes a movement in the opposite
direction. It now limits, renders finite, defines and thereby yields
truth, actuality and content. Hence if one must warn against irony as a
seducer, one must praise it as a guide.

Any question as to the eternal validity of irony can only find its answer
through an investigation into the sphere of humor. Humor contains a much
deeper skepticism than irony...but humor also contains a much deeper
positivity than irony.

Dear Blair:

No need to apologize for the length of your post, and I genuinely hope you
*break* your promise never to post anything that length again.

I have a question, probably very mundane (covered elsewhere?), about
mimesis: isn't structure (or form), by its very nature, "mimetic"? It
occurred to me, while reading Ira's wonderful reading of _Ketjak_, that
structure (or form, or "frame" even) is the one thing all works of art
(including wholly "conceptual" artworks) have in common. No duh, but it
struck me for some reason. & then, it immediately struck me that, well,
for an artwork to have a structure, doesn't that alone make it "mimetic" of
"reality," however (& by whomever) that "real" is structured?

In other words, no work of art, whether actualized or at any point of
conception, is "another world." While our ideas of how the world is
"structured" vary from age to age & from person-within-an-age to
person-within-an-age, the notion of an underlying structure -- whatever
differences we might have about the specific attributes -- seems across
the board unquestioned/unquestionable. Since the one defining
characteristic of "the world" we all might agree on is that it *is*
(however, even randomly) structured -- how can there *be* "another" world?

Yours,

Gary

Yes, Steve, I agree with your comments, especially as you bring up
Foucault in light of Butler, but I would--just for sake of furthering
this line of thought--suggest that part of Butler's thesis (and
Foucault's, if I am  not mistaken) is that we don't simply think but are
thought.  In your example for instance, actuality is not simply
constructed for us, by us, but has the emphasis you suggest when you say
it is constructed through us.  That is, it thinks us.  The real--oops--the
ACTUAL thinks us, not necessarily we it.  This, of course, is scary.  But
then again, reading the newspaper the other day when Ralph Reed and his
Republican hench-men (The Real?) were out in force was scary too.  My
point?  Perhaps I'll defer to Richard Rorty here and repeat his idea that
the real is out there and we have no access to it--all we have is our
descriptions of it, descriptions that come and go through time,
descriptions that are perceived as better or less suited to accounting
for particular phenomena in the world.  Poetry--Art (and I'll include
science here)--are those areas of imaginative experience where those
descriptions are forged.  I need to jump over to the Gasset stuff and
follow this up . . . .

Yes, perhaps.  And if that were the case then our fears would be a
strange conglomeration of real (I feel funny using this word now) and the
imagined.  I mean, not all the time are fears . . . given validity by
their object.  Sometimes what lurks out there isn't there.  Sometimes it
is though.  What I find interesting about this sort of observation about
experience  (real, actual) and the imaginary (fears, creativity) is that
there is sense in which one might say that John's fears give rise to the
condition of creativity itself.  I wonder, though, if this isn't a
masculine conception of creativity?  That is, perceiving it as developing
out of a response to a perceived threat (I'm thinking of Cixous in
Castration and Decapitation).  Anyway, thanks for the thought, John.

On Sat, 20 May 1995, Blair Seagram quoted Gasset, I believe, to the effect:

Art has no right to exist if, content to reproduce reality, it uselessly
duplicates it. Its mission is to conjure up  imaginary worlds. That can
be done only if the artist repudiates reality  and by this act places
himself above it.

This is essentially a modernist postion, one I find a bit too hubristic
for my taste.  Perhaps I'm missing the overall gist of Blair's posts by
latching onto this fragment, but I do so because I am interested in not
only how there is a phenomenological desire to explain the
world--accompanied by the ironic inability and rejection of being bound
to doing so--as well as a desire to "transcend" the world.  What I find
disturbing is that the first position--which I like--is accompanied in
modernist formulations of the function of art by a desire that seems to
me to smack of aestheticist withdrawal from the phenomenological
(otherwise known here as the real or actual).  I want to be able to
maintain that sense of irony that remains sceptical about verbal
descriptions of the world--and here Rorty's irony is more
relevant to my concerns than the modernists Blair alludes to
(Gasset)--while being able to maintain contact with the world.  I desire
not transcendence.  I was reading Ashbery's Three Poems the other day and
am reminded of a section near the end of the second poem about just this
idea--I'll track it down if anyone's interested in how JA handles this
dilemma.  I am also reminded of Whitman's sentiment in Song of Myself
where he says something to the effect of being mad with desire to be in
contact with the earth . . . .

hi loss, this isn't exactly what you were asking about, but i want to plug an
extraordinarily beautiful intermedia book anyway, Excerpts from Dikte for
Dictee, by Walter K. Lew.  It's a response to Theresa Hak-Kyung Cha's book
Dictee; walter's bk started as an essay for a volume of criticism on the piece,
but he came to feel that using standard critical language and form wd violate
Cha's project, so what evolved was what he calls a "critical collage," a series
of textual fragments from Dictee and its various intertexts, as well as his own
notes etc., and film stills, photos and charts that evoke and resonate with
broad and specific themes in Dictee.  All 350 copies are signed with his blood,
thus actualizing one of Cha's wordplays, "sangencre," which dramatic sight led
to some copies being returned after purchase on the buyers' mistaken assumption
that the smear indicated a flawed copy.  So it's more of a living artist/poet
collaborating with a dead one (more so than Spicer/Lorca...)...md

No articles to offer, but fyi the poet Beth Joselow and the

I agree; I think any approach that, however well-thought-out in its

Excerpt from Jeffrey Timmons' recent posting:

 Poetry--Art (and I'll include
science here)--are those areas of imaginative experience where those
descriptions are forged.

Jeff, I agree with you here in at least two senses:

Forged as in Joyce's "forged in the smithy of the soul"; and forged in the
sense of "inventing a fictitious story, a lie, etc." and "to fabricate by
false (I would rather say by metaphoric) imitation."  (Random House
Dictionary of the Eng Lang definitions of "forge" sense 1)

And of course metaphors work by relating/comparing two pictures or areas of
the language network; i.e., one picture gets mapped onto another.  And
obviously, not all the "points" or aspects of one picture align or map onto
those of the other picture.  Hence metaphors are not actually "false"
comparisons, but dreamlike yokings-together which produce a third body (or
picture), allowing us to draw new insights, make new and further connections
between areas of language and experience we previously thought were
relatively unconnected, etc.

Visual poetry collapses this "collaboration" into a single presentation
embodying both visual and language modes/elements.  See, for example, "CORE,
A Symposium on Contemporary Visual Poetry", edited by John Byrum and Crag
Hill, GENERATORSCORE Press, 1993.

To forestall any requests for copies, I need to say here that the first

It has always seemed to me that the notion of the "real" and the
notion of "truth" are both things that have to be defined by the
arguer, that they are both philosphical propositions, and that they
are specific to each arguer's frame. That thing that (seems to?)
happens when you cut your hand thru the dustmotes in the window sun
shaft is what I refer to as the "actual," and hope that whatever the
arguments, ut happens. I.e. it could be real or it could be a
platonic simulacrum.

hi, john, that's an interesting post. i think hegel (i'm not exactly
certain, tho) said art would collapse and become philsophy. i've had several
discussions recently with some friends here in philosophy, and it may be the
revese that's true or truER. philosophy into art. but then there's kosuth:
"art after philosophy"

the genius of rausneberg, cage, even warhol i think is that they erase
the boundaries between art and life -- sounds godawfully cliche, i know,
and like burnham writes in "problems of criticism," the question is no
longer what is good art and what is bad art, but why isn't everyone an
artist?

take care,
carl

I agree, although the definers of these propositions are not always arguers
(I prefer to do so as a "discourser" or something like that, myself).  But
it is interesting that, frame-specific as they are, these notions are
intercommunicable, that there is a significant overlap between my frame and
yours because both are concerned with the actual in a fundamental way.

It seems like if structure is something that underlies(and so transcends)
the world, though, if the world is (passive) structured, couldn't this
structure just as easily express itself in an otherworld that accesses
different structures than are possible in our world, or accesses them in
combinations impossible here?

You don't think it's scary to think that "the real is out there and we have
no access to it", but it is scary to think that actuality thinks us?  (I
agree that Ralph Reed et al. are scary).  To me, that we are thought implies
no lack of freedom, only the acknowledgement that we are produced (produced
like produce, not produced like products) as part of an organic process
called "the world".  This can indeed be scary sometimes, but if it lies at
the roots of what we are, we are deeply involved in it, and access is always
possible, not by attempts at "explaining" the world or "transcending" it,
but simply by allowing it to unfold in our presence, since it will unfold
anyway regardless of our participation.  This is another way of maintaining
contact with the world.  Thanks for your response; I think we agree more
than we disagree on this question...

Dear Loss,
         Such articles may be hard to find. I have had some * experience*

his (real) name for about 15 years, first as an art critic but also in

no work of his got into the public arena without its going through a process
which involved my participation. Meanwhile, I continued to write as a critic
about the work. Complicated.

       The collaborations concern a series works called Tales of Gold.
The first group were text silk-screened in black on largish sheets of gold
pacificated steel. A diagram of golden rectangle divisions was silk-screened
on this and the text occurred within each area, with the type reducing in
size in proportion--this was all done with a computer--so that the text in
the smallest rectangle is almost unreadable. The sheet was then cut into the
seven parts, each with its segment of text, and the work was sold in
pieces--although some buyers were quick enough to buy a whole work before
the piecemeal process began, and some quick re-sale activity also
occurred--although hung as a unit. After that we stopped cutting the sheets
up. The texts are stories concerning gold, my versions of tales told by
others. I have read these at readings, sometimes projecting slides of the
work. We plan to publish a book designed so as to duplicate some of the
results of the passivated steel works. I would not have written these pieces
were it not for this artist's interest in the meaning of gold, the golden
rectangle and the life. I am also, however, confused about my relation to
his work as a whole. What I have described represents one of the clearer
moments but these occur against a background of not knowing the extent of my
responsibility for his work. I published something on this called' Working
with Billy Apple', in SPLASH, in 1985, but so much has happened since then
it onlt tells part of the story.

     So it seems to me there are ad hoc collaborations, chance meetings,
then there are these on-going relationships which I consider especially
interesting:conceptual art, oddly (?) has produced a few double acts: like
Marina Abramovic and Ulay, like Gilbert & George, Clegg & Guttman, and
are you there Madeline Gins?--Arakawa and Gins--I was pleased to read your
message to the net, I have just come back from Sydney and Imants Tillers who
has your new book of course since you sent it to him, HELEN KELLER OR
ARAKAWA which I'm anxious to read. And in some of these a division of roles
is apparent, and sometimes that is a matter of the media sometimes not.....
I am eager to hear of the experience others on the net have had, whether ad
hoc or not.

Dear Jeffrey:

P.S. About the quote I cut off and gave you no credit for. Originally I
put your initials there but for some reason they got lost in the
transfer. Even so, using initials is pretty relaxed I'm sure.
Also, all those * =20Us * in #2 on Gasset. I thought that was some poetic
technique people were using. One of Kenny Goldsmith's posts on the Top 10 kept
saying =20, so I thought he was trying to say, forget 10, let's go to 20.
Now I find out it's unix doing its second conversion of quotes,
the first being a U.

Gasset and Kierkegaard on irony:
(I'm not too keen on Gasset.)
There are ideological differences, as witnessed by Ortega identifying
himself and modernism with 19th century Romantic Irony, by way of the
Schlegel brothers, who both Kierkegaard and Hegel had great disdain for.

Socrates was irony as INFINITE ABSOLUTE NEGATIVITY. And yet it was irony
at work within a given time and situation. This concrete view of irony
through historical actuality is understood by both Hegel and Kierkegaard
as authentic. And even though Hegel did not see in Socrates what
Kierkegaard did, Kierkegaard gives credit and thanks to Hegel for
illuminating the deceptive irony present in certain 19th century
romantics. Nineteenth century Romantic Irony  was not practiced or
conceived as a present moment that was to be displaced by a new moment .
Rather it condemned and denounced every philosophical standpoint without
investigating any. It negated all historical truth to make room for a
self-centered truth. It was not subjectivity that arose, but subjectivity
raised to the second power.

There is an interesting essay on Goethe that Ortega Y Gasset was asked to
write at the time of Goethe's centenary. In the essay he assails Goethe
for taking the easy way out in life, for allowing his talents to
degenerate into hobbies rather than struggling to make his ideas realized
in a more profound way. He criticizes Germany for romanticizing Goethe as
the quintessential classicist, the same way Kierkegaard criticizes 19th
Romantics for not connecting their ideas to the truth in front of them.


I appreciate your remarks about the dilemma between transcendence and irony.
Am I to take it you're not into transcendence but you are into Rorty's
book on irony? What was it called? The book was in my vicinity
at one point, but I forget the gist. What is it?


As far as JA's take on irony or whatever it was is concerned, I'm interested!


take care, Best wishes

Dear Gary:

Thanks for your message. Are you asking me whether structure isn't itself a
form of imitation or representation. Or are you saying that we make sense of
things by creating a structure which is isomorphic with respect to our dna.
That the distinction between inner and outer is negligible. That the work
of an artist is no different than the life they live, both exist in the
same continuum. That every artist must confront the world through a frame
of reference. Please comment.

I'm not sure whether this has anything whatever to do with your second point
but I don't think about another world, I know I'm in this one. In this world
of mine, there is transcendence or at least the possibility for it. Now
I may be ignorant of some argument which might convince me otherwise,
however I am certainly open to hearing it.

take care, Best wishes

John,
Perhaps the next steps after art would be the observations of the various
ways by which we create what unfolds as the dominant strata of our lives.
documentaion would serve no purpose except to ackledge that we are are aware
of it. of course there would be perhaps modes of the process that would
function as post-poetic or post-art that would produce something that would
be exchanged as items, as books, painting and other document forms are now.
The idea though would be a general enhanced field of awareness that would
require a broader perspective than is currently in practice.

Just a reaction,
Jake

To those still reading posts on "the real," etc.--

        The history of "reality" is indeed scary, but I find it even spookier
to look up "thing" in the Oxford English Dictionary, there to find that the
origin of that word in English is inseparable from issues of authority, power,
and the arbitrariness thereof.  A thing is whatever authority (king) designates
as an object worthy of attention & discussion.  Which came first, the object or
the attention?  OED doesn't say, can't say, nor can you nor I, because to do
so would require a god's-eye view of the world.  Our confusion over these
"things" may well be in-built, permanent.  That's as real as it gets, no?

In-Reply-To:  <199505220708.AAA28462@mailhost.primenet.com>

     Dear Steve & Blair:
     The gesture may be meant and/or read as ironic, negative, but the
fact of the gesture is genuine, positive: the structure's the one thing
you can't not mean. (Maybe that's why they call it "the means.")
     The "impossible" or "otherworld" for us living, is absolute silence,
complete negation, total irony. We can't be "in" such a state any more or
less than we always are, though we can, strategically, give or create for
ourselves the illusion of its "presence." (Or "nonpresence," if you want.)
     Carter Ratcliff's argument for Warhol, if I remember, was that the
pieces were completely empty of meaning, & as such, put the viewer "in
touch" with "the void"--that one state of being that humans never fully
experience while alive. (We get intimations, thru art, contemplation,
near-death experiences, etc.) Ratcliff was, I think, arguing that Warhol's
works were "transcendent" in that respect, because they were fully
expressive of that "otherworld."
     But his argument never took into account the specific structures of
Warhol's pieces--which aren't themselves valueless.  One can speak of the
physical properties of his Brillo boxes, of their shape. So, Warhol is
postulating (as he's negating) existence, giving a thing precise value (as
he's emptying it of value).
     Marjorie Perloff talks about the *structures* of Duchamp's
ready-mades, invests them with aesthetic values--values they certainly
have whether or not intended by the maker/user. Duchamp said that he chose
his ready-mades by virtue of their aesthetic neutrality, but Marjorie's
sense was that Duchamp wasn't being completely honest w/us. I disagree, at
least w/respect to his ready-mades, though that doesn't negate the
argument that these things aren't w/out aesthetic value. I think Duchamp
was after what Ratcliff credits Warhol as achieving. (What was that line
someone posted about "out of the labyrinth..."? I think this might be what
that was referring to: the labyrinth being existence, out of the labyrinth
being entrance into that "otherworld.")
     Xavier Villaurutia's _Nostalgia for Death_--Paz thought that title
"too cute" or "clever"--but it makes perfectly reasonable sense to me,
reading those poems; he's nostalgic for a state prior to (& post-) being,
writes poems in an attempt to evoke absolute silence.
     Art meant (or said) to evoke the "otherworld" (silence, negation,
total irony) is trafficking in illusion, & requires faith on the part of
the audience member (if not necessarily on the part of the artist). The
artist in this sense is a magician of sorts, the audience reduced to a
state of awe or artificial innocence.
     In this sense, all art works in the same general way: creating the
illusion of something not really (or not provably) there. What Ratcliff
gets from Warhol, how he talks about getting it, and Ed Foster's "Poetry
Has Nothing to Do with Politics" (about evoking silence) both sound very
much like Fiction Writing 101: "Believable characters" is simply
substituted with "the void" or "emptiness."  Both require conscious
attention to "craft."
     Anyway. My main point I guess was that "total irony" is impossible,
that only the creation of the illusion of "total irony"  is possible.
Artists do not--ever--completely negate the general idea or value of
"art." By being artists, creating art, with however much irony, they're
still positing art in general as a "positive," whatever the message or
meaning.

I thank everyone for their responses. It is interesting, though, isn't
it, that though we have a clear "sense" of this

        (i.e., a collaboration is when an artist and poet work
        together, etc., for a sort of joint goal rather than the text
        being superimposed or vice versa)

that no citations for articles or statements have clearly emerged?

I had hoped that there would be _something_ in print or
online... since I thought there'd be some definitive +ground+ for
this...

this is the quotation from "the creative act": "to all appearances, the
artist acts like a mediumistic being who, from the labyrinth beyond time
and space, seeks his way out to a clearing."

i think it's important to note that any "aesthetic" (a much improperly
used word today) value that one places on the ready-mades is more revealing of
the epistemological preferences of the viewer than it is of duchamp
himself. that's not to suggest there isnt the tongue-in-cheek mentality
operating throughout his project (clearly that adds to his "indifference"
strategically). but i dont understand suggestion that duchamp
wasnt being completely honest with us. duchamp was warhol before even
warhol was warhol. both are important shamen. but it seems awkward to
name them as shamen. as one who has gone thru art school at both the
undergraduate and graduate levels, i still contend that the majority of
readings re the ready-mades are wrong. i think koons has had a lot to do
with that

Again, I don't know, but I have an idea.    I recreate here--if you're
not familiar with it--some of Cixous's statements.

She  suggests an "affirmation of difference: the constitution of a
feminine not defined in reference to the masculine;  it would be an
"economy"  defined by forms specific to women: "a regime, energies, a
system of spending not necessarily carved out by culture.  A feminine
textual body is recognized by the fact that it is always endless, without
endin: there's no closure, it doesn't stop, and it's this that very often
makes the feminine text difficult to read.  For we've learned to read
books that basically pose the word "end."  But this one doesn't finish, a
feminine text goes on and on and at a certain point the volume comes to
and end but the writing continues and for the reader this means being
thrust into the void."  A feminine text "takes the metaphorical form of
wandering, excess, risk of the unreckonable: no reckoning, a feminine
text can't be predicted, isn't predictable, isn't knowableand is
therefore very disturbing."  Just a few suggestions of a direction for an
answer to your question.  For all the claims of essentializing sexual
difference, though, I find cixous interesting.  And yes, men can write
the feminine--poets, though, not novelists.  According to her....

Carl,

I don't think the people you mention "erase the boundaries between art and
life", but they may blur them a bit by integrating aspects of each in the
other.  My notion of erasing the boundaries would be more like conceiving
your entire life and all your thoughts and experiences as art.  But even that
is not really what I want to mean, if for no other reason than that if
everything is subsumed under the one category, art, then you have basically a
superfluous category (categories are meaningful or useful only in relation to
other categories).  I may mean something like realizing the complexity and
interwoven unity in multiplicity of everything, but that sounds suspiciously
academic and even religious in overtone, so that's not quite it either.  In
fact, I think I mean I don't have the words yet to say what I mean.

I do have the feeling that continuing to make art (i.e., writing "poetry" and
publishing it, or making visual art, etc) may not really accomplish all that
I/we want to accomplish.  And I don't mean just social change or changes in
our ways of thinking, although those are certainly worthwhile changes to
strive for.  I just don't think that art is finally that effectual in doing
that.  (Of course I continue to believe that art accummulates small changes
over time which can lead to shifts in the culture.)  But, the culture is
becoming ever more adept at swallowing any artistic production whole and
commodifying thus neutralizing it.  Our productions can have an effect in our
small circles of readers/correspondents (such as this discussion group, and
the readers of our small presses) and change can build and evolve and even
leak out slightly, but will probably never  become a significant factor in
the culture at large.

Enough rambling.  This is a conflicted subject for me.

Dear Jake,

Thanks for your thoughts on the next steps after art.

Could it be that we might discontinue making art as it is currently
understood because we finally realize that its forms and modes of
understanding can no longer express quite what we want to say?

And what would we do then?  Not an Art Strike.  That's not what i mean it
all.  And is simply living it without producing documents or relics somehow
going to be enough?

We need a new idea of a supple communication fine-grained enough to
accommodate a wide range of new approaches.  We need to somehow re-think the
entire enterprise.  Art has become mere decoration.

This is good thought here, but perhaps we need to somehow try to think
outside received categories like poetry, art, science or religion.  All these
modes of enquiry have their own pre-conceived notions and filters.  We just
might need new ones.

Gary,

Can people evaginate "the general idea or value of "art""?  i.e., turn it

Okay, according to that regional magazine, this Martha Stewart is
"the definitive American woman of her time." But who is she? Or, what
does she do? Is she a shrink? A professor? An actress? A Politician?
I have heard of a lot of American (sic) women of our time, but I have
never, before this netstuff, heard of her. Is it the fact that in New
York they take what happens there to be the real U.S. the way the
U.S. calls all their sports winners the "world champions"?

I think it's precisely this fact that indicates that cixous is not
essentializing sexual difference; she makes very sure to say the "feminine"
and not the "female"; both men and women incorporate all of those qualities
called "masculine" and all of those called "feminine", but in different
"mixtures", I'll call it on the fly here.  It's only through various
processes of cultural history that the masculine has come to seem so
exclusive and "desirable" in men only and the feminine for women only.

What is intriguing is this notion of writing "engendering" itself; not only
that it situates itself along a sort of spectrum of gender, but that it can
do so independently of the identity of the writer, and effectively so when
the writer is able to abandon his/her identity to the writing.

By the way, I once saw Cixous and she mentioned Shakespeare and Genet as
convincing writers of the feminine voice--& Shakey in the character of
Cleopatra, no less!

My _Dictionary of Word Origins_ says that "The ancestral meaning of *thing*
is 'time': it goes back to a prehistoric Germanic *thingam, which was
related to Gothic *theihs* 'time,' and may come ultimately from the
Indo-European base *ten-* 'stretch' (source of English "tend", "tense",
etc.)  In Germanic it evolved semantically via 'appointed time' to 'judicial
or legislative assembly.'  This was the meaning it originally had in English..."

So, while the word may be bound up with power and authority, the way power
and authority bind up everything they come in contact with, it's also bound
up with something that eludes power and authority:  time, which is more
fundamentally grounded.

The OED says pretty much the same as the above.  The word comes into English,
though, out of the mouths of kings saying "OK, here's what we have to sit
down and discuss now."  One of the earliest recorded instances is in
_Beowulf_, just so.  Perhaps, in the Old Scandinavian whence it derives, it
signifies something more democratic.  If so, I'd be glad to hear it.  Who
would know?

To be precise, wouldn't we have to say that the "time" that's cognate with this
convocational "thing" means something more like what we mean when we say
"appointment"?  This was way before Heidegger, Augustine, or any of the other
heroes of abstract thought who represent time as so "fundamentally grounded."

I don't want to exaggerate the importance of these word-origins.  Time passes,
regimes come and go, and the originary violences (if such they were) of our
social order recede in importance beside our prospects for freedom and justice.
My comments on "thing" were intended to lend another voice to an ongoing theme,
though the point is as often forgotten as raised in the larger discussion here:
our things, the very shapes of our attention, are haunted by authorities long
dead and discredited.  The implications of this are variously under discussion
here, under several headings.

john, hi: this may be an unfair question for anybody but can you expand
on that. this is an important issue. one of the ways i've hit upon that
challenges these modes and pre-conceived notions is through working

regards to my study here in the university. looking forward to further
exchange on this topic

hi, john,

point well taken in regards to the erasing vs blurring the boundaries
distinction. once again, if i can refer to burnham's essay and offer a
loose paraphrase, art, at least on the psychic level, allows a culture to
remain in contact with its boundaries facing nature. that's always struck
me as such an important definition, for lack of a better term, of art and
the purpose underlying art. on one level, tho, i think there does exist
that erasing of distinctions between art and life in that there is a
certain state, call it a frame of mind, that you come to and there is no
more art, there's no need for it, it ceases to exist. maybe that relates
to transcendence, which is something i take very seriously

but then, on the other hand, there is the "work" of art. my notion of
the _work_ of art is that it's an indexical sign -- crudely, indexical of
something sacred

i disagree with respect to your notion of the failure of art to inspire
change or a realignment of consciousness. maybe that's just over-wrought
idealism on my part (hell, there's a phrase!), but it's something i've
taken a lot of heat over...

...i think you hit on the essence of art, tho: "I may mean something like
realizing the complexity and interwoven unity in multiplicity of
everything, but that sounds suspiciously academic and even religious in
overtone..."

right on!, i think; and what's wrong with sounding those over-tones:
suspiciously academic and even religious. i'm convinced that that's how
i'm perceived. maybe not the religious part, but for sure the other. i
presented a paper on bpNichol's poetics in april in which i attempted
to work within his texts of bliss by inventing and writing my own text
of bliss, and the result was performance-like, altho it wasn't no
performance but the real thing. suffice it to say it didnt go over
very well, altho, in the final analysis, i did my job. and it signifies
to me that i might be on to something here, but that's another discussion
 altogether

'to go beyond the point where it is even neces-
              /sary to think in terms of words'

Subject:      Re: The Etymology of Things -> Instances

Jim and Steve's discussion of power and "things" judicial has another
parallel found recently in an essay I've been reading by Castoriadis in
"Thesis Eleven" 24   "The State of the Subject Today." Just that "time,"
"thing" draw an etymological/use similarity in Castoriadis' use of
"instances."  In referance to Freud's use of "instanz" as conflicts between
opposing instances, or the multiplicity of "phychical persons." Instanz as
Freud meant it carries a juridical flavor and "instance" in French can have
this same "authoritative" connotation. But we can use time and thing to get
at the meaning of instance. In this (an) instance, some "thing" takes
"place" at a particular "time" - instance is a situation.

What concerns me is not that these words have a juridical, or power-based
etymology - this is not really surprising   but that the "instance" of
"things" (human) act at all "times" within this "juridico-administrative
space." That we "take our place" in this space along side/within words as a
mode of being points not to an etymological root, as Jim rightly points
out, but out to a connotative function of the state in word-use. Lest we
forget that speaking is a "state"-ment.

This is what I've always thought R. Grenier meant by I HATE SPEECH.  That
the "multiplicity of phychic persons" taken in/taking up  a poetic critique
of "state" as "juridico-administrative" enterprise can intervene in this
juridical (be-it democratic) process of "state"-ment. That there is a
conflict between opposing instances (the juridical and the "liberatory") of
the word, of "statement" and that the highlighting of this conflict is a
process of intervention.

As an aside, I like Ron's update of "addition" to "intervention" in -

>The perfection of forms as interventions in nature.

I'm not sure that even "form" is permited here though Ron. You have said
something like "Perhaps poetry is not a form at all but an activity."

So, in this instance, we act.

This haphazardly said, someone really must do a clear analysis of the
successes and failures of this "project" of intervention.

Carl,

thanks for your perceptive points on "the next evolution of art".

your bpNichol quote "to go beyond the point where it is necessary even to
think in terms of words" is one aspect of my notion of the next evolution.
 words (language) oversimplify, place thick outlines (cuts) around
pieces/parts of our fluid thoughts & perceptions.  They straitjacket our
imagination of the possible as much as they propell it.

And, I don't think silence is the only alternative to words.

Carl,

I agree that attempting to think outside categories may be THE issue
currently.  Interdisciplinary studies linking formerly isolated areas of
inquiry has been an invaluable method with many bright results (such as chaos
theory in physics).  However, at this point i'm trying to imagine jettisoning
the notion of categories, trying to forget most things, opening the mind amid
an emptiness, and simply being in that awhile to see what floats up.  I have
a friend (a visual artist) who has been letting go of language in various
ways (for instance by not speaking for days at a time and just thinking) for
quite awhile now and then returning.  Lately, she sits in her studio and
thinks as she does things in her sketchbooks which she insists are not
drawings.  (Though they look like what you or I would call drawing)  And she
says she doesn't remember most of what she does or thinks about during these
hours.  She and I have developed a distinction between "thought" (which is
conscious, ego-directed) and "thinking" which is unconscious,
multi-dimensional, the tips of which surface as "thought".  This might be
something like what I mean.  But there aren't words for it (or may not be or
at least i haven't found them yet).
Best,

John

Dear John:

Can't resist this re: your "Art has become mere decoration":

        WHITE LILY

        Hungry and humming in the world's weeds
        I staggered aimless into focus & generally
        avoided work. My life was bearable
        tho I never slept, grew incoherent
        with the excellence of art, which gave me

        peace. I could have worked. Why didn't I work?
        Instead, at 19, I found savage friends
        a tribe, who clothed me & gave me money
        to be serious, my obscurity
        part of the atmosphere. "I'm beating my brains out"

        "I'm stuck." We fucked for hours after the funeral
        slept in hammocks, woke to drink coffee
        & read. Osamu Dazai's NO LONGER HUMAN
        and the complete works of Philip K. Dick.
        We went in on THE WRITER'S MARKET

        treated everyone as audience, our lives
        an exiguous silver flood of action seen at a distance
        went to, & abandoned, the university
        & did what we did outside. We learned
        to tell lies, to tread dangerously on everything

        that moved. We insisted on ourselves w/smoke
        in the blood, redeemed all bogus weight
        for cruder pleasure. I wish that today was yesterday.
        Today, when all tendency is "mere decoration"
        I'm unpopular everywhere because they expect nothing

        either way, accept me or reject me, not this.

                        * * *

I actually didn't take that "mere decoration" from your post, but from a
statement Ron Silliman made in Lally's _None of the Above_ anthology of
1976. (There's a great photo of Ron in there, too -- long hair, 'burns,
"blues" sunglasses, outstanding (what?) Panama hat? I think? (Ron?) --
'stash, OUTRAGEOUS stripes goin' on in the pattern of his shirt, cup of
coffee (I think?) gripped tightly (will he throw it at the photographer?),
posture all aslouch, but an *energetic* slouch -- to put it in plain English:
the dude is lookin' like Charles Williford's younger, more intense brother.)

Anyway, that word "evaginate" again: Well, you know who I've always
thought fits this description? Bern Porter. He's still alive, as far as I
know, still one of the most active mail artists in the world (art created
w/the understanding it'll be received, experienced & then likely dumped in
the wastecan -- tho I'm sure there's a few well-meaning U's of Anyplaces
that're archiving the stuff). The guy gave up a fairly stable life as a
nuclear physicist (I'm sure that's not the technical name for what he
did), published books for a while (including Robert Duncan's first),
wrote the Sci-Art Manifesto, made plans for works of art that've never
been created, put together a number of books of founds that very few
people have probably ever seen (tho they've got an outstanding number of
'em at Woodland Pattern), opens his FRONT LAWN every summer to -- what?
-- spontaneous art activity (or "non" activity?) of some kind, and has
managed to never have been taken seriously or spoken of by any academic
-- at least, not that I've seen (please don't ruin my day by telling me
someone's doing their thesis on him), & when you mention his name to
people, your response is typically a perfect blank stare. (Tho, I've been
surprised on more than one occassion.)

I don't know if he fits your description, John. But if anyone's managed
to "turn 'the general idea or value of "art"' inside out so that its
former inside becomes the whole world of our experience, he's the most
likely candidate I can think of off the top of my head for anyone who's
ever come close. Well, him and Jack Smith, what I'm learning (or
deceiving myself into believing I'm learning, I should say) about him.

Actually, there are undoubtedly hundreds of others, thousands, perhaps,
sprinkled all over the world.

But we're fetishists, John. The artproduct -- we can't get around it --
whether it's the artpiece, or the account.

Yours,

Gary

I guess what I was reacting to was a sense that words, which must inevitably
enter a historical culture that includes power and authority, cannot also
open (or at least point) out of power structures.  I don't see it that way,
although it's certainly not as easy as "language always transcends
power-structures."  But your other point--that it's tricky to go mucking
about with word-meanings from thousands of years ago--is also well-taken.

No, George, you haven't quite got it yet. *Martha Stewart Living*, as
her magazine is called, is a major international publication. I'm
looking at the November 1994 issue (where the turkey recipe came
from). Defending her "Calendar" ("Martha's Calendar" it's called) she
writes in "A Letter from Martha": "I know that the calendar is full,
but it is full so that it can coax all of us into balancing our lives
so that there will be time to plant daffodils, cook a special meal, or
collect old-fashioned Christmas ornaments. For me, 'living' is filling
my day with activity that is meaningful, productive, and interesting.
I truly believe that organization, deep-seated curiosity, and
attention to what's really important will give each of us fuller and
more special lives."

Philosophy for the nineties.

Also included are tips on winterizing the garden, canning brandied
pears, grouting and caulking, and a guide to her TV show.

Let me know if you're interested in the turkey recipe.

See you next week, I hope.

Subject:      some Lorca

Hallo all, I thought I'd post the opening speech from a translation I've
been commissioned to write (for no fee!), from Lorca's first play, Bad
Dream of the Butterflies (cos I'm quite proud of it, and it took about
a week, maybe forty hours, of solid focussed concentration and work):



ESTEEMED guests: the show you've come to see's minor and unsettling -
sadly someone grasps for the full moon, and winds up his hands full
of shards from a broken heart.

LOVE perplexes and shocks men all the time. Love is set tonight in a
closeted orchard, where long ago lived bugs - who we show nibbling
their way through peaceable and settled lives. The bugs contentedly
existed, only to suckle on dew and breed awe of their gods into their
young. They loved, and believed in, a natural love only concerned with
HOW to love. Like grandfather to father, father preached it to son, like
an ancient pure pearl the first in the family line got handed by God. Like
the LOVE that relaxes and takes the POLLEN all the time from the unstinting
flowers to come into the air, so natural love accepted their surrender
in the sweet fumes of grass.

BUT there was one bug one day who grasped at a radical love, who had an
intuition to rework things for himself. Working perhaps through poetry
a literature student of the few who ever go for a walk forgetfully left
in a field, the bug earnestly swallowed lines like "I want the one I can't
have, and it's driving me mad...." Oh, how I entreat all my esteemed guests
not to litter the countryside with their purchases: if they find out the
sincere who have not become deadened like us, our overdone cliches can
actually do them over.... Words that ask who MADE the God who made the
heavens can DESOLATE those who think with the guru absent.

COME useless words, register a sincere life thus was lost, love was DEATH.

THE ENDLESS portering of the scythe to us by Mr Skull and Bones! It is a
primal image our holy books have copywrit, moral: the caress that makes
the head spin secretly turns the handle on Death's Door; Cupid's got his
feet up in the spacious cockpit of the Death's Head; roses, kisses and
pining clad a blade to finish you off.

******************************************************************

A VETERAN Shakesperean fairy who escaped to the living wood pulp of a
real heath, and still flutters about with his cane, is the one who gave
Mr Lorca the plot, one dusky equinox when the herd were all indoors in bed.
So did our spooky show come to be rendered! WE'VE nearly got to it, but
first I ask of you all the SAME favour that the heath-sprite asked Mr
Lorca that dusky equinox when the herd were all indoors in bed: really
explore where you STAND, on these refined utopian bugs swanning about
in grass. Who ARE Europeans, with all our drinking "problems" and "human
nature", to recoil from these tranquilly closeted and merry vermin taking
in the sun in the morning? What DRIVES you so to be rid of these of nature's
simpletons? WHO CANNOT SEARCHINGLY love gravel and vermin cannot feel God's
reign!

The veteran fairy said these words especially to the poet:
        "Coming is the flora and fauna's reign. Men blunder about God's
        creation but the
        fauna and flora stay always in God's light. Lorca, tell these
        men LOVE is born in sameness of PASSION in all the walks of life.
        Sameness in what ripples the flower in the air and the big star.
        Sameness in the words that spout cool in a water
        fountain and echo in the same key in the big sea. Lorca, make
        them humble, equals we all are in Nature."
And no more would the veteran say.

SO, ON with the show! STRUGGLE with your reflex tittering at these bugs,
these seeming children, seeming unmanly. And if tonight's at all instructive,
go to the heath to give your thanks: to the veteran fairy with the cane,
tranquilly taking in the dusk, while the herd are all indoors in bed.

Federico Garcia Lorca

Thanks, Steve, for showing me how my first post on this topic seemed much
more pessimistic than I actually feel.  Your response points up a problem
in academic discourse that troubles me greatly, tho.  I write of how a certain
term is or seems "spooky" or "haunted," and people naturally take it as a call
to abandon the use of that term.  The thing is, "thing" is indispensible.
Its troubling political dimension (I won't call it baggage, since that
term paints a false picture of how words work) will not go away, but neither
does it necessarily always dominate.  Power and hierarchy are ubiquitous,
but they certainly aren't every"thing"!  I would respectfully ask that poets
and other artists resolutely confront the things that bid to needlessly
dominate us (and by opposing end them?  heh heh . . . good luck!) and also that
they (we) resolutely believe, even if utopically, in freedom.  Of course, I
can't tell y'all what to do.  But yes, folks, this *is* about poetics.

        Republican National Committee threatens artists over use of
                                RContract with AmericaS

Did you know that the Contract with America is a registered
trademark? ThatUs right. In yet another sign that the rights of free
debate and public discussion are under attack, the Republican
National Committee has threatened artists Nora Ligorano and
Marshall Reese over the use of the name RContract with AmericaS
in their latest artwork.

Last month the artists presented their new limited edition of
RContract with AmericaS underwear in an installation at the Center
for Book Arts in New York City. The new art piece follows the
artistsU successful edition of the Bible Belt. It continues their
fascination with producing wearable art that addresses political
topics, as well as their concerns about the packaging and
marketing of political ideas.

Their new limited edition artwork consists of 120 signed and
numbered pairs of mens and womens briefs. The artists have
recontextualized the RepublicansU Contract with America by screen
printing it on the seats of mens and womens cotton underwear.
The face of Newt Gingrich adorns the crotch. The Associated Press
reported on the art work after the artists sent pairs of the
underwear to President Clinton, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole,
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and other elected officials in
Washington, D.C.

Allison Fahrenkopf Brigati, the Republican National Committee
Associate Chief Counsel, wrote the artists Rto discontinue [their]
unauthorized use of the Contract with America logo and text
immediately.S

The ACLU Arts Censorship Project and cooperating attorney
Elizabeth McNamara of the law firm Lankenau, Kovner and Kurtz
have written to Ms. Brigati that Rthe art project is a classic
example of political satire. Each limited edition work is
accompanied by a statement explaining the message intended by
its creators. The combined impression is clearly humorous, and
obviously meant to parody the Contract with America. Such a
limited use on what is not a commercial product but rather an art
work carrying the strong political speech message of its creators,
we believe, constitutes protected political expression.S

                        For more information, contact
                        Ligorano/Reese by phone or fax at
                        (718) 782-9255.

Subject:      crisis

I'm forwarding some selections from posts on Ht-Lit that might be of
interest to readers here in relation to recent discussion under this
subject:  -


I believe it was Stuart Moulthrop who first observed, in his introduction
to J. Yellowlees Douglas' I HAVE SAID NOTHING, that there seem to be an
exceptional number of car crashes and dismembered bodies in serious
hypertext fiction. Collisions feature prominently in:

        Michael Joyce, AFTERNOON
        J. Y. Douglas, I HAVE SAID NOTHING
        Monica Moran, AMBULANCE (Electronic Hollywood)
        Michael van Mantgem, COMPLETING THE CIRCLE (Eastgate, in press)

and less prominently in

        John McDaid, UNCLE BUDDY'S PHANTOM FUNHOUSE

Dismembered bodies appear in:

        J. Y. Douglas, I HAVE SAID NOTHING
        Monica Moran, AMBULANCE
        Kathryn Cramer, IN SMALL AND LARGE PIECES
        Shelley Jackson THE PATCHWORK GIRL (Eastgate, in press)

and the threat of dismemberment, or at least puncture, pervades

        Mary-kim Arnold, LUST.

Moulthrop's VICTORY GARDEN includes a car chase (suggesting crash) and
explosion (suggesting dismemberment).

        Note that neither the authors nor the audience of these works include
        the adolescent boys whose preoccupation with violence is proverbial; I
        think it safe to assert that these works are totally unlike Mortal
        Kombat and its kin.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Why *are* there so many crashes and body parts?

Moulthrop, in his introductory essay to I HAVE SAID NOTHING, suggests that
the  crash enacts the hypertextual breaking of the line. Dismemberment,
too,  might by extension reflect the dismemberment of the unitary text
through  which a richer hypertext may emerge.

Mary-kim Arnold, in the course of a really remarkable reading and lecture
at the "Serious Hypertext" symposium in Boston last weekend, suggested that
the violence of these images reflects the effort required by women to
wrestthe tools of writing from (predominantly male) control and bend them
to  their purposes.

Kathryn Cramer, in an earlier "Serious Hypertext" meeting in Ann Arbor, had
noted instead the importance of violent expression in writing for and by
women,  in horror  and literary fiction and well as in literary hypertext.

If I understand Diane Greco's viewpoint correctly in her forthcoming
hypertext, CYBORG: ENGINEERING THE BODY ELECTRIC (also in press), the theme
of dismemberment arises naturally from the female construction of the body,
and from the cyborg's resistance to the masculinization of technology.

In an offhand, improvised remark during a recent talk at Gettysburg, I
myself ascribed crashes and dismemberments alike to the hypertext writer's
desire to disrupt surfers, browsers and grazers, to grab the reader and
shake her and get her to STOP and PAY ATTENTION.

(These summaries to terrible violence to the arguments advanced by their
original authors, and I do urge readers to refer to their writings and not
to rely on my flawed readers).

---------------------------

Why *are* there so many crashes and so much dismemberment?

(Mark Bernstein of Eastgate)

While I can understand women feeling that it's reflective of their
experience, I think we all, male and female, are experiencing and
metaphorising our own losses in this move to digital space. Hypermedia is a
very disembodied communication. And we've lost our books, which were
physical experiences, extensions of our bodies as well as our minds.
Perhaps we are representing, even mourning our past.

And we are also perhaps trying to free the reader from the old ideation
patterns: crash! and cut off your expectations. Crash!: crisis, and things
don't have to act according to normal. Time shifts. Perception shifts.
Awareness expands. Crisis may be more easily and accurately portrayed in
hypertext because the experience (which most of us have had) of a
crash/crisis is multilinear. It does make sense to evoke this in the
reader, although it seems clearly in danger of becoming a cliche, doesn't
it.

Mark,

Should I take it as symptomatic er something that your notice re: Poetic
Briefs showed up immediately after a posting about the "new limited
edition of Contract with America underwear"?  Is THAT where you're
getting your funding?

Just wondering.

THE TIME IS NOW

      HELP SENATOR LEAHY STOP THE EXON COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT

The Senate is expected to on vote the Communications Decency Act (CDA,
a.k.a. the Exon Bill) within the next three weeks.

The Communications Decency Act, in its current form, would severely
restrict your rights to freedom of speech and freedom of expression
online, and represents a grave threat to the very nature and existence
of the Internet as we know it today. Without your help now, the
Communications Decency Act will likely pass and the net may never be
the same again.

Although the CDA has been revised to limit the liability of online
service providers, it would still criminalize the transmission of any
content deemed "obscene, lewd, lacivious, filthy, or indecent,"
including the private communications between consenting adults. Even
worse, some conservative pro-censorship groups are working to amend the
CDA to make it even more restrictive.

Currently, Senator Exon is negotiating with pro-censorship groups and
commercial entities that would be affected by the CDA. The voices of
Internet users must be heard now. We need to demonstrate that we are a
political force to be reckoned with.

In an effort to preserve your rights in cyberspace, Senator Patrick
Leahy (D-VT) has introduced the only legislative alternative to the
Communications Decency Act.  Senator Leahy is willing to offer his bill
as a substitute for the CDA, but needs your support behind his efforts.

Senator Leahy's legislation would commission a study to examine the
complex issues involved in protecting children from controversial
content while preserving the First Amendment, the privacy rights of
users, and the free flow of information in cyberspace.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANOTHER PETITION?

Yes.  With a strong showing of support from the net.community, Senator
Leahy can offer his bill as a substitute for the Communications Decency
Act when the Senate votes on the issue later this month.  Senator Leahy
needs and wants to demonstrate to his colleagues in the Senate that the
net.community is behind him in his efforts. We must rise to the task
and demonstrate that we will not sit idly by as our rights are
threatened.

Senator Leahy, a strong civil liberties advocate, has been the Senate's
most vocal critic of the Exon/Gorton Communications Decency Act, and
has taken a leading role in defending the rights and civil liberties of
Internet users.  Senator Leahy has taken a great political risk in
representing the interests of Internet users on Capitol Hill.  The time
has come for us to show our appreciation and our support for his
efforts.

The previous petition against the Communications Decency Act generated
over 108,000 signatures, and was instrumental in Senator Leahy's
decision to offer his alternative   As the Senate moves to vote on the
CDA, we must act quickly to ensure that our collective voice continues
to be heard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS LEAHY PROPOSING?

Senator Leahy's bill, S. 714, would direct the Department of Justice and
the Department of Commerce to commence a 5 month study to examine:

* Current law enforcement authority to prosecute the distribution of
  pornography over computer networks;

* Whether any additional law or law enforcement resources are necessary;

* The availability of technological capabilities, consistent with the
  First Amendment and the free flow of information in Cyberspace, to
  protect children from accessing controversial commercial and non-
  commercial content;

* Ways to promote the development and deployment of such technologies.

After conducting the study, the Justice Department must report to
Congress on its findings, and, if necessary, recommend changes in
current law.

Leahy's bill represents the only substantive legislative alternative to
the Communications Decency Act, and will buy important time to have a
detailed and rational discussion about the issues involved in
protecting children from controversial content, and avoid the rush to
censorship which is occurring now on the Senate Floor.

Without a strong show of support for Leahy's bill, the Communications
Decency Act is very likely to pass.

THE PETITION STATEMENT

We the undersigned users of the Internet are strongly opposed to the
"Communications Decency Act" (Title IV of S. 652), which is currently
pending before the Senate. This legislation will severely restrict our
rights to freedom of speech and privacy guaranteed under the
constitution.

Based on our Nation's longstanding history of protecting freedom of
speech, we believe that the Federal Government should have no role in
regulating the content of constitutionally protected speech on the
Internet.

We urge the Senate to halt consideration of the Communications Decency
Act and consider in its place S. 714, the "Child Protection, User
Empowerment, and Free Expression In Interactive Media Study Bill", an
alternative approach offered by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PETITION RATIONALE

We oppose the "Communications Decency Act", sponsored by Senators James
Exon (D-NE) and Slade Gorton (R-WA), for the following reasons:

* It criminalizes the transmission of constitutionally protected speech,
  including the private communications between consenting individuals;

* It would violate privacy rights by protecting system administrators
  who take steps to ensure that their networks are not being used to
  transmit prohibited content, even if those steps include reading all
  messages, in violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act
  (ECPA).

* It fails to account for the unique characteristics of interactive
  media, including the tremendous control users have over the content
  they or their children receive.

* It would give the Federal Communications Commission jurisdiction over
  online speech by giving the FCC authority to establish rules
  governing the distribution of content online;

The Internet and other interactive communications technologies offer a
unique opportunity for the free exchange of information and ideas, and
embody the very essence of our nation's democratic traditions of
openness, diversity and freedom of speech.

As users of these technologies, we know perhaps better than anyone that
there are other, less restrictive ways to protect children from
controversial materials while preserving the First Amendment and the
free flow of information.

Senator Leahy's bill provides an opportunity to address the issues
raised by the Communications Decency Act without restricting the free
speech and privacy rights of users.

Subject:      Re: John - next steps after art

John,
You're absolutely right, we must get beyond these categories and the
assumptions that attend them. It is almost as if the label poet, or painter,
or whatever is a means of dismissing the entire project.
We could attempt radical new mediums, but we see what happened with
'happenings'. They quickly became just as classified as anything else. And
you're right, an Art Strike is not the answer, since those who are profiting
from the system as it is will not strike, at least most of them will not. So
all you have is people assuming they have more power than they do, and the
mindset that produces these power games is precisely the origin of the
problem to begin with. Nothing is resolved.
Going underground, as, who was it, I'm sorry, I can't remember who,
suggested, is a possibility as long as we don't call ourselves underground
poet, painters etc. Duchamp said the solution for the great man of art for
tomorrow is to go underground. (I paraphrase, but I think that's the sense of
it.)
Finally we must move beyond our own sense of self individually, to move
beyond our own tendency to rely on easy categorization and description and
beginning from that point we might produce a way of living, thinking (or
other mental states), and externalized modes that would be the next step.
Though being post-art they would not be seen as steps after, as in
post-modern, but as something entirely other in relevance to anything that
had gone before.
Sorry to ramble so long, that's my take on it. Today, at any rate.

Jake

Subject:      Re: Poetry happenings: London, UK, July 1995

I was in London and Cambridge last month, and picked up a few flyers about
readings there just for interest's sake: only two seem applicable here:

POETS/WRITERS readings--"bi-weekly, Mondays 8pm, plus added special events".
At the east/west gallery, 8 Blenheim Crescent, London W11.  Ladbroke Grove
Tube.  4 pounds/2 pounds 50 p concessions.  For information, phone
(0181)-740-9818.  Looking at the schedule for the next couple of months it
lists:

June 12.  FIRST IN A SERIES OF TALKS ON BRITISH SMALL PRESSES OF THE 60'S
AND 70'S: 1. Trigram Press: run by poet Asa Benveniste, published Tom
Raworth, Jack Hirschman, J.H.Prynne, David Meltzer, Lee Harwood.  Talk with
John Latimer Smith by Pip Benveniste, followed by films of Trigram poets
reading.

June, date t.b.a.: Ed Dorn reading.

July 12: Fran Landesman: poet, songwriter, humorist; her songs recorded by
Ella Fitzgerald, Shirley Bassey.

July 17: Gavin Selerie: poet, critic; work included in _New British Poetry_
(Paladin 1988), reads from recently completed work _Roxie_.; and Miles
Champion: new poet whose work has been praised by John Ashbery; reads from
_Sore Models_ (Sound and Language 1995).

----
I saw Champion read in Cambridge, & he's certainly worth seeing--rather
influenced by Raworth in the incredible speed at which he reads, I'd
imagine.  Anyways, I also have a flyer for the SubVoicive reading series:
unfortunately it looks like there's not much for the month of July, but
I'll type this in anyways for those who might be interested:

SubVoicive readings, at The Three Cups, Sandland Street, Holborn Tube;
Admission 4 pounds/2 pounds concs.  To confirm details phone Robert
Sheppard at (0181) 672 4027.

6 June          Bill Griffiths
20 June         Latin American Evening presented by Will Rowe
27 June         Gilbert Adair and Lawrence Upton
4 July          Bob Cobbing
12 Sept.        Aaron Williamson
26 Sept.        Spencer Selby & Gavin Selerie
10 Oct.         John Muckle & poet t.b.a.
24 Oct.         Tim Fletcher & poet t.b.a.
7 Nov.          Allen Fisher and Adrian Clarke

(Never seen any of these authors read, but I did pick up a cassette of
Allen Fisher reading, called _Scram_, at Compendium Books, which is very
good.)

OK: hope this is of some assistance.  --Nate Dorward (ndorward@ac.dal.ca).

From John Byrum,
"we have a very narrow definiton of art which needs to be opened out &
reopendout again all the time."

After Duchamp, after Cage, WHO has a very narrow definition of art?
Although I'd be interested in points of view who found even those artists
with a narrow point of view.

Why define (divine, de-vine) art at all? I had a teacher once who wanted
to define it, admittedly awkardly, as "anything seen in an art-seeing
context." But what's the line between art and non-art? and why?

From RIFT, the translation issue.

QUESTIONNAIRE/CUESTIONARIO

*How would you define translation?  As a process or as product?

*Who is translating?

*What is being translated?

*Do you consider some texts to be untranslatable?  If so, how would you
describe the obstacle?

*Isn't the idea of "version" a funny place for the translator to be left in?

*When see some of your own texts translated into a different language from
the one you wrote them in, what kind of relation would you established
between the two of them?

*Is it true that today there are fewer people translating?  If so, why?

*What does it say about our present situation that translation
seems to occur almost only when the "original" material is has been
canonized within its own culture?

*And what would be the possible relation between this kind of selection and
that other relationship between imperialism & translation?

*Are you ready to accept translation as another way of writing?

*When you or somebody else refers to a text as illegible, what do you
does she/he mean by that?  Do you see any connection between the notion
of a text being illegible and the task of translation?

*Do you think of some texts as more worthy of a translation than others?
Could you elaborate on it?

*Would you say that you translate a text or a person?

*Do you consider yourself a translation?

*Could you imagine life without translation?

jake: that was me, i think, paraphrasing duchamp's idea to go
underground. i guess a similar notion is barthe's "death of the author"
and foucault's neat idea to publish books without the author's name
printed across them. anonymity. that entails a great sacrifice, but may
be one way of subverting the western box. sacrifce. but that's were the
prophecy is

No, I can't imagine life without translation, translation of many kinds, pro-

to this list, & I'll be with her/him all the way.
As Baudelaire said (in French), "How is it that any human being in reasonably

Right on.  I very much believe in "retrieving" language from these spectres
of power that tend to haunt it.  Sometimes this involves an attempt to delve
back to its (the?) source, and sometimes it involves puahing envelopes of
meaning out to places they've maybe never been before.

Many thanks for your message.  I agree completely with all your comments and
particularly with the excerpt above.  We each need to discover our own ways
of proceeding, ways which will be largely or even entirely "other" than
anything which could be called "art".  Some may be communicable and others
may not.  Some may include production, others may not.

Excerpt from recent message by Charles Alexander:

After Duchamp, after Cage, WHO has a very narrow definition of art?
Although I'd be interested in points of view who found even those artists
with a narrow point of view.

Why define (divine, de-vine) art at all? I had a teacher once who wanted
to define it, admittedly awkardly, as "anything seen in an art-seeing
context." But what's the line between art and non-art? and why?

Charles,

Thanks for the difficult questions in your reply.  I think many people have
underlying "expectations" of what art has come to mean in our culture.  These
expectations differ among individuals of course, but most do distinguish some
of their experiences as belonging to an art context and others which do not.
 Perhaps I'm asking if it is possible for us to think of all of our
experiences as art, which would have the effect of eliminating "art" as a
separate category of experience in our lives.  If everything is "art", then
nothing is "only art" (i.e., non-functional esthetic experience), but the
rich complexity and interwoven unity in multiplicity of esthetic experiences
could be lived in all aspects of our lives, and not only those bits of our
lives spent in producing and consuming "art" as it is currently our
enculturated  habit to do.

Art has meant different things in different cultures and times, and has not
been a separate category in many.  I'm asking if it is possible for us here
and now to so completely open the notion of art out into all aspects of our
individual and social/cultural existence that it would to all intents and
purposes disappear; i.e., become an inseparable component of the textures of
our living.

I'm aware this sounds utopian and/or simplistic.  It is.

John, I hope what you want is possible, i.e.

"I'm asking if it is possible for us here

I'm not certain it would be either utopian or simplistic. Sometimes it
would be terrible. It would always be living, which is complex, not
simplistic.

For some people, living is already close to this. I am not certain that
such living is better or truer than any other, but it does seem to move in
a direction which feels true to me. For many people, art simply doesn't
exist, it's not part of their consciousness. This does not necessarily mean
that their "individual and social/cultural existence" is any less
integrated with art than if they were more aware of art.

I feel like I'm confusing the possibilities here rather than clarifying
them, so I will stop.

Maybe the discussion of post-art needs no more(?) A perfect time, it seems
to me, to add something.

Art seems principally an orientation capable of accommodating, being with,
transforming, ignoring (pick your verb!) any raw material.  Another
possibility is leaving the raw material right there and having something
different from (or perfectly identical to) it in mind. It's all something
about state of consciousness, not unlike homeopathy, whereby the greater the
distillation, the smaller the actual substance, the higher the frequency.
And in that practice, "like cures like." (wonderfully enough)

Something else about art is not a necessary condition, but certainly
associated:  human competence.  Anybody out there know of, hold deep
affection for, Thomas Gilbert's HUMAN COMPETENCE?  1960 was the year, if I'm
not mistaken.  It's performance technology stuff, but moves all over the
scape in relation to doing things well.  It's not necessary to agree with
Gilbert.  It's only a pleasure to breeze around the subject of things done
well and what makes various practices "good."  A brave book, running counter
to the mediocrats.

Art offers an avenue that makes having discipline a tremendous bonus. You
get to choose your time, your materials, your path, whether or not to have a
destination, whether to make it palatable.  (Or maybe anyone is powerless in
relation to these things?)

Well, I've made a short story long, that's clear.  Let's just say that what
comes after art is higher frequency.  And with each of these, the
possibility of greater pleasure, greater clarity, more subtle movement
(thought or physical).  Or absolutely nothing at all.

" . . . foucault's neat idea to publish books without the author's name
printed across them. anonymity. that entails a great sacrifice, but may
be one way of subverting the western box," as John Byrum says.

A good friend in Tucson, Larry Evers, asked me several times in the mid to
late 1980's, during discussions of language poetry and its decentering of
authorial personality and identity in the work (I'm not certain anymore
that there is any such decentering), if there was a movement away from the
person to something like "language itself," why the authors didn't just
publish texts without their names attached. Larry works with oral Native
American traditions, living ones, where, although contemporary singers and
drummers and dancers do make their own contributions to the tradition,
such personal ownership of the work is just not part of the system. I
never had a good answer for him. I am not quite ready for such anonymity,
and few I know are. Perhaps we are just part of the western box.

Subject:      Re: Art, etc.

Sheila, thank you for your intervention in the afterart discussion.  Art,
however one defines it, is not going to go away anytime soon.  I think John
and Jake are "after" something that already exists, though there could and
maybe should be more of it--and I think Charles A. agrees.  Charles is right,
too, that attempts to define art usually lead more to muddle than to clarity.

(I wonder, while we're on the subject: where are the voices opposed to
generalizing about art?  Is there no one here who thinks poetics is
something fundamentally different from the principles of painting, the
principles of music, etc?)

But I say, if there's a muddle let's jump right in.  If I may, Sheila, pick
apart one of your sentences, "[a]rt seems principally an orientation. . . ."
This term implies a map or world, a topos in which one might wander.  The
political dimension of life seems that way too: left and right, for example,
amount fundamentally to orientation, to facing.  In the case of the political
"sphere," orientation is vis a vis something like history, the ongoing account
of where "we"'re headed.  Classically, conventionally, it's progress for
progress's sake on the left, order for order's sake on the right, although
these have gotten truly muddled now.  In art,  what might correspond to these
specific axes of orientation?

You write of "accommodating, being with, transforming, ignoring (pick your
verb!) any raw material" or "leaving the raw material right there and having
something different from (or perfectly identical to) it in mind."  What sort of
thing in mind?  To what end(s), specifically?

"It's all something about state of consciousness, not unlike homeopathy,
whereby the greater the distillation, the smaller the actual substance, the
higher the frequency."  This is intriguing.  I don't believe in homeopathy--
it seems a rather wishful mysticism--except in the sense of vaccine, of "what
don't kill you makes you stronger."  But what is "frequency," and why is its
being "higher" a good thing?

Further, is art's progress always toward the more subtle?

I think the generalizable part of art is made of questions, not answers--a
matter of balances, some of which you enunciate well: regarding competence and
discipline, for example.  Art plays with these as it works with them, throwing
the very distinction work/play into question.  As Kant points out, it throws
the concept of purpose or destination into question.  Also delectation.  Also
power.

Far from making a short story long, you/we have only grazed the surface.
Oscar Wilde, in the intro to _Dorian Gray_, warns us not to go below that
surface, that terrible danger waits there--but then again, he may have been
just kidding.  Heh heh.

Yes, CAP-L seems only to respond to obituaries or the "major" prizes.  But
that seems to be it's function; few folks over there (including those who
are "here" too) didn't rise to the occasion of discussing Michael Palmer
or Ezra Pound when their names recently came up there.

(At virtually the same time there were about 20 posts on <poetics>
nominally about Gerald Stern.  But, then, that's something else again.
They just don't have much "fun" over on CAP-L.  Who _were_ they discussing
while Martha Stewart was explained to death here.)

But be careful when you start talking about <folks who get left behind>,
'cause a lot of that may just be fashion or name-checking.

Consider this: there are an awful lot of people these days for whom the
term <avant garde> means warmed-over 1960s-70s art with drum machines
and/or body piercing added.

Or did us old farts just get left behind?

Yup--and then quickly checked out.  Bracing to recall how tidy-tight the
mainstream/academic's definitions of "great poetry" are.  But then they

"The creative act takes on another aspect when the spectator experiences
the phenomenon of transmution; through the change from inert matter into
a work of art, an actual transsubstitution has taken place, and the role
of the spectator is to determine the weight of the work on the esthetic
scale" (Marcel Duchamp: "The Creative Act"). --apologies fr keeping the
duchamp quotes going. he's so important, i think, to our continuing
interests in and theorizing of poststructuralism.

yr title, "Art, etc.," reads to me like a poem! just wanted to add that.

It seems to me you might have some ideas about some things that have been
bothering me for a while.
What do we mean when we call someone's work sentimental?
What is the relation between poetry and capital?
How do readers of ths list know when a work of theirs is
finished/complete/abandonable?
How do we know when a work is good?

re the definition of art -- that's easy: anything made with the working
unity of hand eye and mind. no mystery there whatsoever. the simplest
thing in the world: art. however you write it or conceive it. writ with a
small a or write large with a big A. low art. high art. mind is everywhere.

Subject:      ed's new book

It was reported on the list yesterday that Ed Foster's new book
was sighted in the window of Grolier's (alongside Joe Donahue's
new one). I'd like to report that I have received, in my non-
virtual mailbox, and to my great pleasure, a copy of Ed's new
book, _All Acts Are Simply Acts_, published by Rodent Press in
Boulder ($7).
The book itself is a beautiful artifact, with letterpress cover,
perfectbound. Inside, the work, poems and prose poems, span a
range from the caustic to the gnostic. On the surface, the
writings are possessed of meditative calm, while their deep
structure roils & boils with recurring motifs of alchemy & loss.
Such lines resound: (from "Basic Rules")
    "It is the sacred work of poetry to let the violence through
    . . . The universe is not consistency but radical confusion,
    and poetry opens there the crevices through which this can
    be seen."
YES! In fact, all of the poems in the book are confirmations of
these "Basic Rules" -- like Benjamin's Angelus Novus, bearing
witness to cataclytsms both historical & personal, they are
renderings of something that's been rended.
The book collects poems from two of Ed's previous chapbooks,
_The Space Between Her Bed and Clock_ and _The Understanding_.
Among the new poems are two co-translations from the Russian
(of Zhdanov). Here's a quote from one of them:
    "Dying nations are driven away,
    but before they vanish like clouds in a storm,
    they tear the leaves from the trees.

    All that indifference in your face will pass.
    The bird will cry out.
    The leaves will be torn away.
    Your hand will leave its trace."
There's an almost Gothic sensibility that is active in this work,
an awareness of "dark transcedence" and "intricate release" which
I was not expecting, although maybe it's explained by what Ed calls,
on the final page of the book, his "New England ways" -- the ways
of Poe, repossessed from Baudelaire?
It's a definitive collection, which I hope defeats Spicer's dictum,
quoted in the book: "No one listens to poetry." Or was this supposed
to be poetry's salvation?

Gary Sullivan wrote:

Carter Ratcliff's argument for Warhol, if I remember, was that the
pieces were completely empty of meaning, & as such, put the viewer "in
touch" with "the void"--that one state of being that humans never fully
experience while alive. (We get intimations, thru art, contemplation,
near-death experiences, etc.) Ratcliff was, I think, arguing that Warhol's
works were "transcendent" in that respect, because they were fully
expressive of that "otherworld."
     But his argument never took into account the specific structures of
Warhol's pieces--which aren't themselves valueless.  One can speak of the
physical properties of his Brillo boxes, of their shape. So, Warhol is
postulating (as he's negating) existence, giving a thing precise value (as
he's emptying it of value).

Dear Gary:

What you say about Warhol sounds very good. And I know Carter Ratcliff
was crazy about him. At least he was before he wrote the book. And maybe
he was afterwards as well. I always wondered about that. I didn't read
the book, but I did take a class with Ratcliff at the time he was writing
it.

The more I know about Warhol, the more I like him, on the whole. I think
he did some great stuff. For me, he was able to take certain European
values and push them in an American way, more than any other artist in
America. It's the fact that he made movies, did a magazine, was open to the
society at large. If you like, was more like a Renaissance artist, and when
I say that I should add a court artist. An artist to "high society" which he
so craved to be accepted by. And which he finally was.

There was nothing intellectual about Warhol. The fact that we have all
these theories about him, is irrelevant to the man. What I like about that,
is his irreverence for the angst driven world that went before him. I
once saw a TV program that interviewed many blue chip artists around
Warhol's generation. After listening to Warhol, they all sound so puffed
up and full of it. Warhol was funny and in a way straight forward.

Having said all this, there is something about Warhol that disturbs me.
Something about the way he could treat people around him. I know there are
those who would agree with me and I know there are those who loved him
and believe he didn't have a mean bone in his body. I never knew Warhol,
but I have met his business manager Fred Hughes. And I know Fred truly
loved the man and I know that without Fred, Warhol would never have hit
the big time like he did. Meeting Fred Hughes was like meeting the other
half of Warhol. After that things fit together for me much better. And
what I think about Hughes, is that he may be a tough business man,
but he is also totally open to people and ideas. And in fact was probably far
more generous than Warhol. Warhol could be odd about money, really tight
I understand. Whereas Fred would straighten things out, make them fair.
And I know some people, like Bob Colacello, got hurt by both Hughes and
Warhol and finally quit Interview, where he had been the editor for 13
years, because Andy and Fred wouldn't let him own any part of the
magazine he had busted his ass for.

It's stuff like this which is disturbing. It's the fact that Warhol rose
while so many of those around him burnt out. I think if I had been in
Warhol's little circle I would have been destroyed. I guess Warhol didn't
mean to do it, but he had a way of bringing down those around him. It's
almost eerie. If you were around Warhol and a creative person, you had to
be very, very careful not to be seduced and in so doing become a sacrifice.

I read an interesting article once, that criticized Warhol for remaining
an adolescent. It went on to say that the grid of America, the finely
knit fabric of our society was being destroyed by peolpe like Warhol.
There was no continuum. There were those at the top and those at the
bottom and nothing in between to connect the two. The only way to
identify with the top was through an image. Something like a bottle of
Heinz Ketchup. I may not have that quite right. But the point was, Warhol
did not encourage real communication or depth. It was all a glorious facade,
glamorous and full of starlight and hollywood, although I admit he had
his darker moments.

Enough said

Total irony may not be possible in art because art exists within a frame
of reference that is suppose to be outside the so-called objective world.
We make a space and say what happens here is not the world of everyday
'reality" but may be a reference to it.

Okay, fine. But I'm with Kierkegaard that total irony can exist and did
exist in the figure of Socrates, who died because of it. He could have
saved himself, but chose to go down by irony, leaving us with a type
of irony, we call "Socratic". Another type is "dramatic" irony.

Jim, Glad to have your interested and interesting response.  Point on

This has to be unknown a priori, I believe, or the process satirizes itself.
My position (there goes that old geography again!) on the matter relates to
an observation that there's a consciousness that "takes in" or somehow
juxtaposes with another substance (or being, or consciousness).  And when
that happens, anything can happen on the continuum that runs from heavy
manipulation at one end to complete absorption at the other (I'm willing to
haggle on the determination of what those ends might be!).  So I wouldn't
want to say "to what ends," because that would spoil the surprise, itself a
necessary condition for worthwhile art, as I perceive it.  (I am
continuum-happy today.  I like the extreme surprise end of the spectrum
running from expectation to surprise.)

> I don't believe in homeopathy--
>it seems a rather wishful mysticism--except in the sense of vaccine, of "what
>don't kill you makes you stronger."  But what is "frequency," and why is its
>being "higher" a good thing?

Homeopathy (not to be confused with any variety of less precise alternative
health areas) is actually the antithesis of allopathic medicine, which is
the prevailing "drugs and knives" kind of medical practice that people have
grown accustomed to in our culture.  There's a statue to Dr. S. Hannemann in
Washington, D.C., the individual who brought about the practice of
homeopathy. The practice is quite scientific. It lost the war that made the
American Medication Association version of medicine the one that reigns.

I'm not using the word "frequency" haphazardly.  Higher frequency is, in
general, a more desirable state on account of its correlative greater
accuracy, clarity.  More precise attunement to events, movement, and just
plain stodgy mass.

Not an expert in homeopathy, I'm just an interested consumer and supporter
(No longer do I seem to need it for what it helped me address, a plus for
the practice!) I do NOT profess expertise, but I've read a great deal about
it, examined with fascination the Materia Medica on which it is based.

You may or may not know that in rural parts of Europe, homeopathic doctors
would be able to visit people maybe only once per six months or so.  The
remedies (as they are called) would be provided to people who would benefit
from them long-term, on account of the relative power of the substance, as
it would have been "found" as right for the individual, not the condition
(Allopathy addresses a cold as a cold as a cold.  Homeopathy would give you
a different remedy from what would be given me for the same condition.)

I don't mean to transfer the topic to homeopathy, as this was simply a
bridge to our REAL focus.  But I think it's important to mention some things
about the concept.

Your point that:

>Further, is art's progress always toward the more subtle?

adds to this point, I think.


>I think the generalizable part of art is made of questions, not answers--a
>matter of balances, some of which you enunciate well: regarding competence and
>discipline, for example.  Art plays with these as it works with them, throwing

Jim, I appreciate your perspective and what you've added to my sketching!  I
agree about the questions versus answers. I'll give your eyes and my fingers
a rest just now.

Sheila

The list itself, professionalization of writing, is a guarantee of poetry

I appreciate Jim Rosenberg's sense that his definition of "too sentimental"
is a personal one related to his own work, but still, when he says that to
say a work is "too sentimental" is to express

"the fear that the work is too much comprised of the emotional substance of
a single self; the fear the emotional substance of that self is unreliable,"

more questions are raised.

How comprised is "too much comprised?"

What is the "emotional substance of a single self?" -- although I like the
conjoining of the words "emotional" and "substance."

How does one determine what is unreliable? Is anything entirely reliable?

If I might muddle things even more, since Jim P. says I probably agree with
some of the things he and Sheila are saying about art. I'm involved,
because I do various sorts of things I consider art, with his question,

"Is there no one here who thinks poetics is something fundamentally
different from the principles of painting, the principles of music, etc?)"

I've made music and studied it and used it in writing in various ways, I've
made visual art in the form of books and prints, and collaborated with many
far more involved in the visual arts, as well as with dancers and
composers. I think that these various arts are different from one another,
possibly even radically different, but not fundamentally different. I
usually shy away from wholistic/holistic definitions like Carl's that art
is what involves hand, heart, and mind. But I do think all of these arts
involve utterance, silence, space, movement, structure, context, and other
concepts in common, though how these concepts achieve form may be quite
different. I am also certain that there may be more variation within an
artistic practice than among various artistic practices. For example, my
work in language has more to do with Steve Nelson-Raney's work in music
than it has to do with Dana Gioia's work in language.

A very late addition to this thread. Not really a hoax, but worth checking out:

        John Peck's _Poems and Translations of Hi Lo_

...one reviewer referred to 'Hi Lo' as Peck's (I think this was the
neologism:) 'alteronym'. An interesting way to put it.

Jim, Jim, Jim,

Lots of us are afraid of our emotions, but it's beyond me to think of an
"emotional substance" that *is* reliable-or to see that as a problem.

"Is there no one here who thinks poetics is something fundamentally
different from the principles of painting, the principles of music, etc?"

---

what follows are some quotations from joseph kosuth's essay "Art After
Philosophy I and II" (first published in _Studio International_, oct. and
Nov.; it's also in Battcock's anthology _Idea Art_ 1973):

-

"Indeed, it is nearly impossible to discuss art in general terms without
talking in tautologies... what art has in common with logic and
mathematics is that it is a tautology; i.e., the 'art idea' (or 'work')
and art are the same thing..."

-

"It is necessary to separate aesthetics from art because aesthetics deals
with opinions on perception of the world in general... Above all things
Clement Greenberg is the critic of taste. Behins every one of his
decisions is an aesthetic judgement, with those judgements reflecting his
taste. And what does his taste reflect? The period he grew up in as a
critic, the period "real" for him: the fifties."

-

"But in the philosophic tabula rasa of art, 'if someone calls it art,' as
Don Judd has said, 'it's art.'"

-

"All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only
exists conceptually."

-

"Art "lives" through influencing other art, not by existing as the
physical residue of an artist's ideas."

-

"Works of art are analytic propositions. That is, if viewed within theor
context -- as art -- they provide no information whatsoever about any
matter of fact. A work of art is a tautology in that it is a presentation
of the artist's intention, that is, he is saying that that particular
work of art _is_ art, which means, is a _definition_ of art."

-

"I do not make art," Richard Serra says, "I am engaged in an activity; if
someone wants to call it art, that's his business, but it's not up to me
to decide that. That's all figured out later."

-

"Formalist criticism is no more than an analysis of the physical
attributes of particular objects that happen to exist in a morphological
context... Formalist art is only art by virtue of its resemblence to
earlier works of art. It's a mindless art. Or, as Lucy Lippard so
succinctly described Jules Olitski's paintings: 'they're visual _Muzak_.'"

-

Subject:      Re: really Real Andy

Thinking of Carl Lynden Peters' recent comments, after returning from
a break from the List, especially this thing about Art.

I would like to insert an alternative possibility into the
discussion. Duchamp and I hope Kosuth are covered by it. Theatre and
Music arts come in as performance:-

My hypothesis is that Art is Cunning and it is Wit in Europe  before
about 1660:
 Beauty confuses everything  after about 1660. Aesthetics, then ( not
so long ago and now, can be founded on
assessments of an action on the social in which widespread delusions
 are seen to be just that. (The notes on irony are very useful.

Representations of all kinds in text and image and in performance can
be measured by their sometimes enduring interest to those of us who
encounter them who value them when we want to do something
effective ourselves.

Beauty is one among many devices, like realism
is a device, in this account of Art. Contents, Forms, Chance
Procedures are all devices or instruments, not criteria for value.

[A note apropos C.Olson's Post-Modern.  Isn't it the case that his
location of the Modern is somewhere around 500 B.C.?  (Someone will
remember, at present I can't think of Chapter and Verse. The
discussion is in any case somewhat broader than that regarding modern as
industrial revolution in its steam phase onwards....

The difference between pre- and post- 1660 in this proposal is the
difference between say a painter making devotional images, received
as such before 1660, and the academies of painting then turning same
into museum pieces, as instruction in how to produce fitness and
beauty. So doing, the said images cease to be received as devotional
images and become Art as we are now accustomed to it.

My point is that what we call Art, is something we have detached
from its occasions of social functioning. We have also detached it from its craft/guild
methods of instruction, over a relatively short period of time. And
that it has taken a whole lot of struggle in the 19th and 20th
centuries to maintain whatever is left of our knowledge of how to be
effectively Cunning and Witty.

(I say "we", I wish I could say "they".

    I have this vague memory (I wasn't really paying attention to this
    thread) that a couple of months ago there was some kind of discussion
    on Milo DeAngeli (FINITE INTUITION-sun and moon, 1995) on this list--
    My vague recollection was that there were alot of people deriding him
    as either sexist or elitist or something. Does anybody remember the
    nature of that discussion? Or debate? Is anybody who participated in it
    still on this list for the summer? I ask, because I'm writing a review
    and I am curious what others said....(or even what others may say--
    coz I guess it's possible I was imagining the whole thing---)

Dear Chris:

I think Bernstein posted a brief selection from an essay (included in the
S&M book?) on this list a couple of months ago. "Deriding him"--that
would've been me. Not for being sexist or elitist. For a statement (this
is from memory) like "Perhaps there can be no great poet who has not
produced a serious study of some previous great poet." I took Bernstein's
quoting that particular passage but doing so as part of an ad for _Finite
Intuition_ to be Charles's way of entering into the (then ongoing) debate
about "theory" without soiling his pantlegs.

I don't remember everything I said, but it came out of that quote, which I
thought (& still think) was bullshit. Not for being elitist -- elitism
doesn't bug me. But simply that it isn't true -- assuming everyone
agrees on what a "great" poet is (good luck) -- that to be a "great"
poet, you necessarily produce a serious study of another, previous,
"great" poet. (& this is coming from someone who *writes* about poets I
think are "great," & who plans on writing about more of them.)

Spencer also responded to the quote from the ad; and, again, while I
don't remember the specifics, the argument wasn't either that DeAngeli
was being sexist or elitist. (I don't think it was, anyway.)

*Limited*, maybe. And this criticism, Chris, limited to the contents of
the brief, posted quote. (He may be a perfectly wonderful poet or
essayist for all I know.)

Yours,

Gary

     Isn't it just sooper deelux having for role models a generation who
in all earnestness & with all evidence to the contrary refer to themselves
as "Generation 1," and who are simultaneously dismissive of our own
ludicrous notions? [Reaches for gum, pulls out fresh stick.] Wow! I just

books, pamphlets and journals; specialist bookdealers and distributors; and
poetry events and readings.  There is also a fairly comprehensive

will be added as I pull stuff down from the shelves.

Any comments, questions, additions, corrections, etc. etc. would be much

be welcome: I'm using a VT100 term., and it looks fine here, but I was
dismayed to see it look rather different & occasionally wrong on MOSAIC--
made a few fixes, but need to know if there's any more trouble.

Ah Carl . . . so you think it's easy . . .

Well, art is no mystery, true.  *Definition* is tricky, tho.

Moment to moment, we all (I bet) use the Jesse Helms method for sorting
art from not-art: I know it when I "see" it.  ("See" is figurative here, of
course--a metonymy.  But signifying *what*, exactly?  (No need to answer right
away!))  You're right that art is fundamental, not a thing that needs to be
explained in terms of other, supposedly more basic things.

Terms like "working unity" sound like bedrock common sense, which in itself
is grounds for suspicion, but let's let that pass.  Blind people do sometimes
make art, and so do hand-icapped ones.  Even the incurably split-minded may,
as far as I know, do this thing too.  Therefore the definition you offer is,
if true, practically all metonymic, wherefore the terms "hand," "eye," and
even "mind" all cry out for further definition.  That's what all this babble
has been about: perhaps not the simplest thing after all.  The *best* one does
in response to this problem is make more art, maybe in the form of poetic
images and aphorisms like the one you have offered above.  But those of us who
teach are called upon to explain, to define, as best we can.  My students have
been trained to expect facts, sadly--not koans.  (Of course I set them koans
too, but I want to let them *feel* they get their moneysworth of facts.)

In order to be useful, a definition has to be reasonably complete.  What
about memorability, for example, which finds no place in your formula?
And why imply a focus on the product ("-thing made") when it's the process
that obviously constitutes the heart of the matter?  That is, if it has a
heart. . .

Hmm,

Well, it seems to me, sometimes, like when I don't sleep, like now, for
lack of a better example, that a "definition" of art is better served,
as Creeley writes, when it is as large as its infinitive: i.e. "to
define".  There seems to be something silent in the infinitive, or
perhaps imperative, which compels art to to grow, break, contradict
and continue like an Escher (sp?) work (his schtuff is more like
a defintion, defining, if it's a good day).  To define is an
animation of what is already alive and hunted.  Whew! I think
I can sleep now.

Jonathan Brannen revisits things, and in that revisiting finds a world,
"no end but among words," yet the living of the words/work is among words

                    THE ANTI-HEGEMONY PROJECT


          A satire, pointedly such, at the present day, and
especially by American writers, is a welcome novelty, indeed.  We
have really done very little in the line upon this side of the
Atlantic--nothing, certainly, of importance--Kenneth Koch's
clumsy poems and Mark Twain's after-dinner sketches to the
contrary notwithstanding.  Some things we have produced, to be
sure, which were excellent in the way of burlesque, without
intending a syllable that was not utterly solemn and serious.
Poems, plays, fictions, essays, epigrams, and pop songs,
possessed of this unintentional excellence, we would have no
difficulty in designating by the dozen; but, in the matter of
directly-meant and genuine satire, especially in or concerning
verse, it cannot be denied that we are sadly deficient.  And yet,
let it be said, while we are not, as a literary people, exactly
equal to "The Dunciad"--while we have no pretensions to echoing a
Popish meter--in short, while we are no satirists ourselves,
there can be no question that we answer sufficiently well as
_subjects_ for satire.

          We repeat that we were glad to see this work of Mr.
Funkhouser and company abroad on the Internet; first, because it
was something new under the sun; secondly, because, in many
respects, it was well executed; and, thirdly, because, in the
universal corruption and rigmarole amid which we gasp for breath,
it was really a pleasant thing to get even one accidental whiff
of the unadulterated air of _truth_.

          For those unfamiliar with the AHP, a brief history is
sufficient to give the satire's overall dimensions.  In February
of 1995, a series of news briefs, modeled in style and format on
those of the "clari.* news hierarchy," began to appear on Charles
Bernstein's "Poetics List," which originates out of SUNY Buffalo.
The contents of these items invariably reflected current goings-
on on the Poetics List, and in the "poetry world" more generally.
Many of these flashes were surreal, but some had an almost
prosaic verisimilitude.  In one, the loquacious Tom Mandel became
a bounty hunter; in another; Ken Sherwood and Loss Glazier were
called "Poetics Police"; in another, Language Poetry was blamed
on tainted baby formula; in another, a "Save the NEA" effort was
termed a cross-dressing fashion show.  All of these interventions
were identified as products of the "bleari.* nooz hierarchy," and
further attributed to "The Anti-Hegemony Project."  With
surprisingly little distortion, the various jargons of politics,
fashion, crime, sports, and economics were used to explain the
ideological workings of the Art of the Muse--and quite
adequately.  The point, as soon became clear, was simple:  to
show that poetry's sublime particularity is no such thing.

          More remarkable than the AHP itself, however, was the
utter silence which greeted these stories' sudden broadcast.
Indeed, until an item appeared transforming Barrett Watten into a
killer whale--adapted from an item on the film "Free Willy"--
there was no public comment of _any_ sort.  And even in this
instance, in the chivalrous outcry of James Sherry, response was
focused on the matter of authorship, the AHP's mysterious
provenance having become a focal point for counter-critique.  We
say authorship and not source, for while the stories _had_ been
posted from real accounts, the stories themselves were unsigned,
and rumor began to circulate _privately_ that the true author--if
such there was--was keeping himself (or herself) hid.  Chris
Funkhouser, from whose account many of the stories had been sent,
quickly came forward to make a public statement, to the effect
that "AHP" was a cooperative project.  And soon enough,
discussion died down again--or appeared to.  Inevitably, however,
the rumors themselves became subjects for AHP satire.  In one, a
tapeworm named "Benji" was said to have burrowed deeply into
Charles Bernstein's personal computer; in another, attributed to
CNN (the Co-Poetry News Network), AHP activity was blamed on a
sentient robot gone mad on too much literature.

          For the record, the AHP's interventions originated from
the following persons' accounts, at the following institutions:
Carla Billitteri, Nick Lawrence, and Martin Spinelli (SUNY
Buffalo), Don Byrd, Christopher Funkhouser, and Belle Gironda
(SUNY Albany), Sandy Baldwin (NYU), Stephen Cope (U.C. Santa
Cruz), Greg Keith (unaffiliated), Nada (unaffiliated).  A few
other accounts were also utilized, but as of yet we are unable to
identify the owners.

          But this was not the end.  In a final hurrah, the AHP,
after 12 days of relative silence, produced _en masse_ a blitz of
items of a different sort altogether.  These appeared on the last
day of Feb. and first of March, 1995.  No longer taking the form
of fake news items, these final messages were modeled on the
adolescent chit-chat of the Internet's many Newsgroups--the
'Net's discourse of choice.  Presented as postings to an
imaginary group called "alt.fan.silliman" (the model, we believe,
was alt.fan.madonna), this later set of AHP posts again used real
names, and again satirized the goings-on on Poetics and in the
poetry world.  But where the "bleari" stories had adopted a sober
language, and had appeared at discreet intervals, the
"alt.fan.silliman" items flirted with incomprehensibility, and
were so voluminous as to overwhelm altogether the Poetics List's
normal flow of activity.  (In a mere two days, there were 24
"alt.fan" messages.  By contrast, across a period of 25 days,
about 30 "bleari" messages had been generated.)  This last
onslaught, unlike the prior intervention, met with immediate
outcry--an outcry that took two basic forms.  _First_, it was
said that the sheer volume transformed the AHP's satire into a
theft of the airwaves; _second_, that the focus on Ron Silliman
amounted to a smear campaign.  In response, the AHP's defenders
pointed out that the satires were in many ways a _tribute_ to Mr.
Silliman.  (The aggrieved poet himself weighed in with a bemused
admission that he _was_, all in all, tickled by the attention--
indeed, he responded to many of the "alt.fan" posts as if they
had really been the outpourings of fandom.)  The second critique
--that the volume was inherently prohibitive of a fair exchange of
ideas--was never directly countered, but in retrospect this point
too seems debatable.  To be sure, the swelling of traffic due to
AHP intervention was sizable, but such swelling is itself within
the bounds of predictable occurrence on a List.  Moreover, when
such swells draw criticism, it is usually on account of their
_content_--a subject that Poetics still seemed unwilling to
broach.  The real source of ire was more probably something else
--something never stated directly.  The "bleari" satires, for all
the                * * * * *  **

                        ...The "bleari" satires, for all
their vehemence, treated poetry and Poetics as a matter of some
importance.  The "alt.fan" items treated these same affairs as
adolescent twaddle.  Could it be that the "alt.fan" postings--
unlike the "bleari" items--wounded the vanity of the List as a
whole, and not merely the figures named directly?  So much, in
any event, for history.

          As a work of the imagination and otherwise, the AHP had
many defects, and these we shall have no scruple in pointing out
--although Mr. Funkhouser is a personal friend of ours, and we are
happy and proud to say so--but it also had many remarkable
merits--merits which it will be quite useless for those aggrieved
by the satire--quite useless for any _clique_, or set of
_cliques_, to attempt to frown down, or to affect not to see, or
to feel, or to understand.

          Its prevalent blemishes were referrible chiefly to the
leading sin of _appropriation_.  Had the work been composed
professedly in paraphrase of the whole manner of our culture's
self-satirizing discourse, we should have pronounced it the most
ingenious and truthful thing of the kind upon record.  So close
is the copy, that it extends to the most trivial points--for
example, the use of fancy, personalized sig. files in Newsgroup
postings.  The turns of phraseology, the forms of allusion, the
use of the screen, the general conduct of the satire--everything
--all--are the property of the culture as a whole.  We cannot
deny, it is true, that the self-satiric model of the discourse in
question is insusceptible of improvement, and that the
contemporary satirist who deviates therefrom, must necessarily
sacrifice something of merit at the shrine of originality.
Neither can we shut our eyes to the fact, that the appropriation,
in the present case, has conveyed, in full spirit, the subliminal
critical qualities, as well as, in rigid letter, the inadvertent
elegances of the journalistic and chit-chat modes of the day.  We
have in the AHP the bold, vigorous, and semi-lucid prose, the
biting sarcasm, the pungent opinionation, the unscrupulous
directness, of the world beyond poetry.  Yet it will not do to
forget that Mr. Funkhouser et al. have been _shown how_ to
achieve these virtues.  They are thus only entitled to the praise
of close observers, and of thoughtful and skilful copyists.  The
analyses are, to be sure, their own.  They are neither clari.'s,
nor alt.fan.madonna's--but they are moulded in the identical
mould used by these uncredited agencies of meaning.

          Such servility of appropriation has seduced our authors
into errors which their better sense should have avoided.  They
sometimes mistake intention; at other times they copy faults,
confounding them with beauties.  In the opening salvo, we find
the lines--

          The palace dispatched Crown Prince Gizzi and
          Crown Princess Willis on a Southern
          California tour three days after the quake.
          Following oblique criticism, the pair cut
          short their trip and returned to Rhode
          Island.

          The royal attributions are here adopted from a clari.
story about the Imperial family of Japan, frequent subjects of
news stories; but it should have been remembered that _Prince_
and _Princess_ enjoy very different meaning when applied to the
ordinary citizens of a modern democracy, than they do when
applied to the Royal Family of Japan.

          We are also sure that the gross obscenity, the slander
--we can use no gentler name--which disgraces the "AHP," cannot be
the result of innate impurity in the mind of the writers.  It is
part of the slavish and indiscriminating imitation of a culture
inured to such sins.  It has done the AHP an irreperable injury,
both in a moral and intellectual view, without effecting anything
whatever on the score of sarcasm, vigor or wit.  "Let what is to
be said, be said plainly."  True; but let nothing vulgar be
_ever_ said, or conceived.

          In asserting that this satire, even in its mannerism,
has imbued itself with the full spirit of the polish and pungency
of the extra-literary, we have already awarded it high praise.
But there remains to be mentioned the far loftier merit of
speaking fearlessly the truth, at an epoch when truth is out of
fashion, and under circumstances of social position which would
have deterred almost any man in our community from a similar
Quixotism.  For the dissemination of the AHP--an undertaking
which brought under review, by name, most of our prominent
_literati_, and treated them, generally, as they deserved (what
treatment could be more bitter?)--for the dissemination of this
attack, Mr. Funkhouser, whose subsistence lies in his pen, has
little to look for--apart from the silent respect of those at
once honest and timid--but the most malignant open or covert
persecution.  For this reason, and because it is the truth which
he and his companions have spoken, do we say to him from the
bottom of our hearts, "God speed!"

          We repeat it:--_it_ is the truth which he and his
committee have spoken, and who shall contradict us?  They have
said unscrupulously what every reasonable person among as has
long known to be "as true as the Pentateuch"--that, as a poetic
people, we are one vast perambulating humbug.  They have asserted
that we are _clique_-ridden, and who does not smile at the
obvious truism of that assertion?  They maintain that chicanery
is, with us, a far surer road than talent to distinction in
letters.  Who gainsays this?  The corrupt nature of our ordinary
criticism has become notorious.  Its powers have been prostrated
by our own arm.  The collusion between government and publisher,
publisher and critic, critic and poet, poet and academy, academy
and government, constitutes at once the most unbreakable ring of
corruption, and the most vicious circle of ideological
contamination, yet to become manifest in our letters.  But to
keep our comments focused on a single link in this chain:  the
intercourse between publisher and critic, as it now almost
universally stands, is comprised either in the paying and
pocketing of black mail, as the price of a simple forbearance, or
in a direct system of petty and contemptible bribery, properly so
called--a system even more injurious than the former to the true
interests of the public, and more degrading to the buyers and
sellers of good opinion, on account of the more positive
character of the service here rendered for the consideration
received.  We laugh at the idea of any denial of our assertions
upon this topic; they are infamously true.  In the charge of
general corruption there are undoubtedly many noble exceptions to
be made.  There are, indeed, some very few magazine editors, who,
maintaining an entire independence, will receive no books from
publishers at all, or who receive them with perfect
understanding, on the part of these latter, that an unbiased
_critique_ will be given.  There are even some editors who refuse
backing from the Federal government (or any other granting
agency) as well.  But these cases are insufficient to have much
effect on the popular mistrust:  a mistrust heightened by late
exposure of the machinations of _coteries_ in New York, San
Francisco, and now all cyberspace--_coteries_ which, at the
bidding of leading small press publishers, manufacture, as
required from time to time, a pseudo-public opinion by wholesale,
for the benefit of any little hanger on of the party, or well-
"Fed" protector of the firm...

        ...We speak of these things in the bitterness of scorn.
It is unnecessary to cite instances, where one is found in almost
every issue of a book.  It is needless to call to mind the
desperate case of Sherry--a case where the pertinacity of
the effort to gull--where the obviousness of the attempt
at forestalling a judgment--where the woefully over-done
be_roof_ment of that man-of-straw, together with the pitiable
platitude of his production, proved a dose somewhat too potent
for even the well-prepared stomach of the mob.  We say it is
supererogatory to dwell upon _Our Nuclear Heritage_, or other by-
gone follies, when we have, before our eyes, hourly instances of
the machinations in question.  To so great an extent of
methodical assurance has the _system_ of puffery arrived, that
publishers, of late, especially author-publishers, have made no
scruple of keeping on hand an assortment of commendatory notices,
prepared by their men of all work, and of sending these notices
around to the multitudinous potential reviewers within their
influence, tucked within the pages of the book.  The grossness of
these base attempts, however, has not escaped indignant rebuke
from the more honorable portions of the community; and we hail
these symptoms of restiveness under the yoke of unprincipled
ignorance and quackery (strong only in combination) as the
harbinger of a better era for the interests of real merit, and of
American poetry as a whole.

          It has become, indeed, the plain duty of each
individual connected with our poetry, heartily to give whatever
influence he or she possesses, to the good cause of integrity and
the truth.  The results thus attainable will be found worthy his
or her closest attention and best efforts.  We shall thus frown
down all conspiracies to foist inanity upon the public
consideration at the obvious expense of every person of talent
who is not a member of a _clique_ in power.  We may even arrive,
in time, at that desirable point from which a distinct view of
our persons of letters may be obtained, and their respective
pretensions adjusted, by the standard of a rigorous and self-
sustaining criticism alone.  That their several positions are as
yet properly settled; that the positions which a vast number of
them now hold are now maintained by any better tenure than that
of the chicanery upon which we have commented, will be asserted
by none but the ignorant, or the parties who have the best right
to feel an interest in "the way things are."  No two matters can
be more radically different than the reputation of some of our
_litterateurs_, as gathered from the mouths of the people, (who
glean it from the paragraphs of magazines, and the screens of
cyberspace,) and the same reputation as deduced from the private
estimate of intelligent and educated persons.  We do not advance
this fact as a new discovery.  Its truth, on the contrary, is the
subject, and has long been so, of every-day witticism and mirth.

          Why not?  Surely there can be few things more
ridiculous than the general character and assumptions of the
ordinary critical notices of new books!  An editor, sometimes
without the shadow of the commonest attainment---often without
brains, always without time--does not scruple to give the world
to understand that he or she is in the _daily_ habit of
critically reading and deciding upon a flood of publications one
tenth of whose title-pages he or she may possibly have turned
over, three-fourths of whose contents would be Hebrew to his or
her most desperate efforts at comprehension, and whose entire
mass and amount, as might be mathematically demonstrated, would
be sufficient to occupy, in the most cursory perusal, the
attention of some ten or twenty readers for a month!  What he or
she wants in plausibility, however, is made up in obsequiousness;
what he or she lacks in time is supplied in temper.  Such an
editor is the most easily pleased person in the world.  He or she
admires everything, from the fat anthology of Douglas Messerli to
the thinnest chapbook of Jessica Grim.  Indeed, such editor's
sole difficulty is in finding tongue to express his or her
delight.  Every saddle-stitched pamphlet is a miracle--every
perfect-bound book is an epoch in letters.  The editors' phrases,
therefore, get bigger and bigger every day, and if it were not
for talking trash, we might very well accuse these persons of
"doing the nasty."

          Yet in the attempt at getting definite information in
regard to any one portion of our poetic literature the merely
general reader, or the foreigner, will turn in vain from print
journals to cyberspace.  It is not our intention here to dwell
upon the radical and over-hyped hyper-textual rigmarole of the
'Net.  Whatever virtues the 'Net may hold, they are ill-suited to
the propagation or discussion of _poetry_, save in the satiric
mode advanced by the AHP.  And the demand that the AHP unmask
itself rings especially hollow, resounding in the vacuous and
unindividuated depths of cyberspace.  Alas, the poetic discourse
found on the 'Net is _virtually_ anonymous.  Who writes?--who
causes to be written?  A volley of names cris-crossing the world,
with no more character than one expects of bums--drunks who seek
out odd-jobs to earn the price of a bottle--_this_, we say, is
the class of person who subscribes to our poetics lists.  And who
but a missionary could put up with such company?  Who but an ass
will put faith in tirades which _may_ be the result of unwanted
abstinence, or in panegyrics which nine times out of ten may be
laid, directly or indirectly, to the charge of intoxication?

          It is in the favor of these saturnine pockets of
electricity that they are charged, now and again, with a good
comment _de omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis_, which may be
looked into, without decided somnolent consequence, at any period
not immediately subsequent to dinner.  But it is useless to
expect literary criticism from a "List" or "Newsgroup," however
useful these may be as sources of information regarding tawdrier
realities.  As all readers know, or should know, these venues are
sadly given to naught but verbiage.  It is a part of their
nature, a condition of their being, a point of their faith.  A
veteran subscriber loves the safety of generalities, and is
therefore rarely particular.  "Words, words, words" are the
secret of his or her strength.  He or she has one or two original
notions, and is both wary and fussy of giving them out.  Such a
person's wit lies with his or her truth, in a well, and there is
always a world of trouble in getting it up.  Such person is a
sworn enemy to all things simple and direct.  He or she gives no
ear to the advice of the runner--"_Put your toe to the starting
line_," but either jumps at once into the middle of the pack, or
breaks in through the ribbon at the finish, or sidles up to the
race with the gait of a crab.  No other mode of approach has
sufficient profundity.  When fairly into it, however, such a
_runner_ becomes dazzled with the scintillations of his or her
own wisdom, and is seldom able to see a way out.  Tired of
laughing at these antics, or frightened by the spectacle, we shut
off the argument altogether, with the computer.  "What song the
Syrens sang," says Sir Thomas Browne, "or what name Achilles
assumed when he hid himself among women, though puzzling
questions, are not beyond _all_ conjecture"--but it would puzzle
Sir Thomas, backed by Achilles and all the Syrens of Heathendom,
to say, in nine cases out of ten, _what is the object_ of a
thorough-going Poetis List posting.

          Should the opinions quacked by our poetic geese at
large, supplemented now and then by the bubblings of fish caught
in the 'Net, should such opinions be taken, in their wonderful
aggregate, as an evidence of what American poetry absolutely is,
(and it may be said that, in general, they are really so taken,)
we shall find ourselves the most enviable set of people upon the
face of the earth.  Our fine writers are legion.  Our very
atmosphere is redolent of genius; and we, the nation, are a huge,
well-contented chameleon, grown pursy by inhaling it.  We are
_teretes et rotundi_--enwrapped in excellence.  All our poets are
Bards, good as Whitman and not yet gray; all our poetesses are
"latter day Dickinsons;" nor will it do to deny that all our
youthful enthusiasts are wise and talented moderns, of the Known
and Unknown variety, and that every body who takes pen in hand to
attack the canon, our Republic of Letters, is as great as
Caesar, or at least great Caesar's ghost.  We are thus in a
glorious condition, and will remain so until forced to disgorge
our ethereal honors.  In truth, there is some danger that the
jealousy of the rest of the world will interfere.  It cannot long
submit to that outrageous monopoly of all that is worth seeking
"from the other side of the century," which the gentlemen and
ladies of the scene betray such undoubted assurance of
possessing.

          But we feel angry with ourselves for the jesting tone
of our observations upon this topic.  The prevalence of the
spirit of puffery is a subject far less for merriment than for
disgust.  Its truckling, yet dogmatical character--its bold,
unsustained, yet self-sufficient and wholesale laudation--is
becoming, more and more, an insult to the common sense of the
community.  Trivial as it essentially is, it has yet been made
the instrument of the grossest abuse in the elevation of
imbecility, to the manifest injury, to the utter ruin, of true
merit.  Is there any man or woman of good feeling and of ordinary
understanding--is there one single individual among all our
readers--who does not feel a thrill of bitter indignation, apart
from any sentiment of mirth, as he or she calls to mind instance
after instance of the purest, of the most unadulterated quackery
in letters, which has risen to a high post in the apparent
popular estimation, and which still maintains it, by the sole
means of a blustering arrogance, or of a busy wriggling conceit,
or of the most barefaced plagiarism, or even through the simple
immensity of its fawning--fawning not only unopposed by the
community at large, but absolutely supported in proportion to the
vociferous clamor with which it is made--in exact accordance with
its utter baselessness and untenability?  We should have no
trouble in pointing out, today, some twenty or thirty so-called
literary personages, who, if not idiots, as we half think them,
or if not hardened to all sense of shame by a long course of
disingenuousness, will now blush, in the perusal of these words,
through conspicuousness of the shadowy nature of that purchased
pedestal upon which they stand--will now tremble in thinking of
the feebleness of the breath which will be adequate to the
blowing it from beneath their feet.  With the help of a hearty
good will, even _we_ may yet tumble them down...

        ...So firm, through a long endurance, has been the hold
taken upon the popular mind (at least so far as we may consider
the popular mind reflected in ephemeral letters) by the laudatory
system which we have deprecated, that what is, in its own
essence, a vice, has become endowed with the appearance, and met
with the reception of a virtue.  So continuously have we puffed,
that we have at length come to think puffing the duty, and plain
speaking the dereliction.  What we began in gross error, we
persist in through habit.  Having adopted, in the earlier days of
our literature, the untenable idea that this literature, as a
whole, could be advanced by an indiscriminate approbation
bestowed on its every effort--having adopted this idea, we say,
without attention to the obvious fact that praise of all was
bitter although negative censure to the few alone deserving, and
that the only result of the system, in the fostering way, would
be the fostering of folly--we now continue our vile practices
through the supineness of custom, even while, in our national
self-conceit, we repudiate that necessity for patronage and
protection in which originated our conduct.  In a word, the
community of poets has not been ashamed to make a head against
the very few bold attempts at independence which have, from time
to time, been made in the face of the reigning order of things.
And if, in one, or perhaps two, insulated cases, the spirit of
severe truth, sustained by an unconquerable will, was not to be
so put down, then, forthwith, were private chicaneries set in
motion; then was had resort, on the part of those who considered
themselves injured by the severity of criticism, (and who were
so, if the just contempt of every ingenuous man and woman is
injury,) resort to arts of the most virulent indignity, to
untraceable slanders, to ruthless assassinations in the dark.  We
say these things were done, while the community in general looked
on, and, with a full understanding of the wrong perpetrated,
spoke not against the wrong.  The idea has absolutely gone
abroad--had grown up little by little into toleration--that
attacks however just, upon a literary reputation however
obtained, however untenable, were well retaliated by the basest
and most unfounded traduction of personal fame.  But is this an
age--is this a day--in which it can be necessary to advert to
such considerations as that the words of authors are the property
of the public, and that the publication of these words is the
throwing down the gauntlet to the reviewer--to the reviewer whose
duty is the plainest; the duty not even of approbation, or of
censure, or of silence, at his or her own will, but at the sway
of those sentiments and of those opinions which are derived from
the authors themselves, through the medium of their written and
published work?  True criticism is the reflection of the thing
criticized upon the spirit of the critic.

          But _a nos moutons_--to the "AHP."  This satire has
many faults besides those upon which we have commented.  The
title, for example, is not sufficiently distinctive, although
otherwise good.  It does not confine the attack to an _English-
language_ hegemony, while the work does.  Also, the individual
portions of the satire are strung together too much at random--a
natural sequence is not always preserved--so that although the
lights of the picture are often forcible, the whole has what, in
artistical parlance, is termed an accidental and spotty
appearance.  In truth, the parts of the satire have evidently
been composed each by each, as separate themes, and afterwords
fitted into the general project, in the best manner possible.

          But a more reprehensible sin than any or than all of
these is yet to be mentioned--the sin of indiscriminate censure.
Even here Mr. Funkhouser and friends have erred through
unthinking appropriation.  They have held in view the sweeping
denunciations of the news media, and of the juvenile spewings of
the Internet.  No one in his or her senses can deny the justice
of the general charges of corruption in regard to which we have
just spoken from the text of our authors.  But are there _no_
exceptions?  We should indeed blush if there were not.  And is
there _no_ hope?  Time will show.  We cannot do everything in a
day--_We've only just begun_, as Karen Carpenter tells us, _to
live_.  Again, it cannot be gainsaid that the greater number of
those who hold high places in our poetical literature are
absolute nincompoops--fellows and ladies alike innocent of reason
and of rhyme.  But neither are we _all_ brainless, nor is Yakub
himself so white as he is painted.  The AHP must read a little in
Jabes' _Book of Margins_--for there is yet _some_ difference
between "_carte blanche and white page_."  It will not do in a
civilized land to run a-muck like a Zapatista.  Mr. Evans and
Miss Moxley _have_ done some good in the world.  Mr. Watten isn't
_all_ killer instinct.  Mr. Silliman isn't _quite_ an ass.  Mr.
Mandel and Mr. Sherry _will_ babble inanely, but perhaps they
cannot help it, (for we have heard of such other things,) and
then it must not be denied that _at an uncertain hour, / That
agony return: / And till the ghastly tale is told, / The heart
within them burns_.

          The fact is that our authors, in the rank exuberance of
their zeal, seemed to think as little of discrimination as Jimmy
Swaggart did of the Bible.  Poetical "things in general" are the
windmills at which they spurred their rozinante.  They as often
tilted at what was true as at what was false; and thus their
lines were like funhouse mirrors, which represent the fairest
images as deformed.  But the talent, the fearlessness, and
especially the _design_ of the project, will suffice to save it
from that dreadful damnation of "silent contempt" to which
readers throughout the country, if we are not very much mistaken,
will endeavor, one and all, to consign it.

Thanks for the comments.

Maybe like you're suggesting Wystan, I too feel the
double cut of quality frees us from the labour
of definition (judgement).  Quality here suggests
poetry is that which constantly is wishing to
abnegate itself.  I guess, then, poetry doesn't even

        Hey, kids:
This chapter rec'd from one W.R. Titterton (or a biographer who goes by
that name) w/ the request that I forward it here, and that it be
re-forwarded to members of the AHP for fact-checking, and then on to the
critic Edgar Allan Poe for a final proof. It's rather lengthy, but the
author claims to have suffered greatly through it, & now asks the same of
you.
     AUNTIE HEGEMONY & UNCLE POE
     by W.R. Titterton
     [This is the first _portrait_ of the great Auntie Hegemony and her
side-kick, Uncle Poe. The author knew neither personally, but watched them
both at work and play.]
     [In these sentences Auntie and Uncle live again, in all their
towering humanity.]
     This is the portrait of wise children. Matilda "Auntie"  Hegemony was
none of your Peter Pans who won't grow up and face their responsibilities.
She was always aware of her responsibilities, and eager to face them; and
she was always a child.
     In a way, Auntie did not grow at all--except in physical bulk.
Writing of poetry world characters, she says that they don't progress,
they don't change, they are _there_, as if eternal. If you turned a corner
and met Mr. Watten, you would know just what he would look like and very
much what he would say. So it was with Auntie. When I opened my e-mail, I
was always expecting to see her striding towards me, a winged vision of
jovial Victory; the big proud humble face, under the huge soft hat,
puckered into a thoughtful smile behind the negligent pince-nez; a
cigarillo sprouting from the corner of her mouth; well-crafted satires,
entertainments and insults bulging from the pockets under the flapping
coat.
     I hope you know what I mean by a child. I hope that you remember how
Our Lord said: "A little child shall lead us." This big little child led
me for many months, and she leads me now.
     I have said that Auntie Hegemony did not change. She did not.  She
changed her opinions, but not her beliefs. Well, let us say rather that,
though she was a grown woman before she said "_Credo in unum Deum_," as a
very small child she knew God.
     Even so, she -- and her companion, the equally God-fearing Edgar
"Uncle" Poe -- were creatures of paradox; while their eyes were on Heaven,
they plunged their very souls into Hell. Neither Virgil nor Dante
accompanied them; they'd read neither thoroughly outside of school, and
were, suitably, too embarrassed to seek _practical_ guidance from either
on such short notice. Once plunged into Hell, they shrieked and gasped at
Simoniacs, Barrators, Hypocrites, Panders and Seducers, spat epithets at
the Lustful and Gluttonous, feinted in terror on Level Five at their own
Wrathful visages mirrored in Styx just below, but all of this willy nilly,
as in _reaction_, or perverse Pleasure, giving no one, themselves
included, any True or Complete Picture or Map of the Underworld.  And
lacking that, they lacked, simply put, The Way Out.
     Anyhow, it was meat and drink to me to find a couple who loved
discourse, but hated this discourse; who were ready to die for their
calling, but not to lie for it, and who were of such blind passion that
they cursed the denizens of Hell, forgetting where they had doomed
themselves to spend their days and nights. I hadn't this particular "food
for thought" since Laura (Riding) Jackson passed through, years ago. While
Jackson's meals were comparatively bland, they occasionally nourished;
Auntie's spicy noodles passed quickly through the system, the tea that
accompanied even quicker;  and what Uncle served up on his unannounced
Memorial Day Picnic was leftovers, the spinach wilted, the milk soured.
     And so, as I say, there are Auntie and Uncle's lively jabs in
fragments. That at present is all we can see; if they are either still
among us, they've made no apparent attempts to strike up conversations or
friendships with anyone but each other, though both vocally detest
_cliques_. Uncle's final statement to the denizens of Hell was an
unusually somber _portrait_ of his own of Auntie Hegemony, casting his
companion as America's Only Satirist, compared to whom he finds Twain
scribbling, Koch stumbling, and is apparently ignorant of (or presumes
irrelevant) the likes of Acker, Ackerman, Ahern, Anderson, Barthelme,
Bergman, Berrigan, Black Bart, Bruce, etc., indeed a list thrice
twenty-six and then some of merely Recent Practitioners of the Art. But
then when one travels in such small cliques, one can imagine one's clever
friends to have invented the Wheel.
     As a matter of convenience, Uncle casts the Other denizens of Hell as
having been _completely_ silent upon Auntie's arrival -- save one outburst
-- forgetting that comments about specific newsjabs were indeed made, that
at least one (should memory serve me) offered "Auntie was actually too
kind [to me]." But this was from one (then) recently fallen, and not a
terribly important soul at that. Neither does Uncle seem to have spent
much contemplation on the _nature_ of Auntie's newsjabs, that they were
not _presented_ as opening lines of a possible dialogue, but ends in and
of themselves. Uncle seems to forget, again as a matter of convenience
(perhaps in a weak effort to establish the newsjabs as vessels of
Irrefutable Truth, or to cast Auntie as an Outsider, Other, her white
sleeves unsoiled) that numerous posts of the same _content_ (Hegemony,
Blind Fashion, and the like), those posted _as dialogue_ and involving
_actual people & events_, *were* commented on, some at great length, and
with a good many denizens of Hell offering a variety of Opinion,
Speculation, Rebuttal and Expansion upon them. That one finds it more
rewarding to reply to Persons than to Bumperstickers, Banners, or News
Bulletins, should surprise no one. That it surprised Uncle suggests that
he, after a short time in Hell, grew as Vain and Uncontemplative as anyone
in Dis. "Not everyone gets corrupted," as Muriel Hemingway tells Woody
Allen (a Satirist, like his precursor Benchley, unknown or not considered
as Important as Auntie to Uncle), but we are all of us human, and have
occasion to lapse.
     But, now I come near to the time when I must bid good-bye to my
Auntie and my Uncle. I, who am a dry-eyed man, feel my eyes fill with
tears for the first time in fifteen years. Auntie, Uncle, I have done this
little _portrait_ in a rush white hot. Does it content you? Please God
that it does not. As Karen Carpenter once sang ... ah, then, but you do
know the words.

    Thanks gary for filling me in on the debate---
     I think the quote you're referring to is
     "The Greek theoria signifies "reflection" but also "solemn embassy,"
     "spectacle." And perhaps there can be no great poet who has not had
     theoretical insights into other great poets...."
     The way i see it (aside from the adjective "great'--maybe it should
     be GROOVY--) is very qualified and not prescriptive but an attempt
     to widen the range of the meaning of the word "theory" to include
     what perhaps is too derided as "loose talk," and thought "as such."
     Certainly Auntie Hegemony would be theory then---and not just because
     of certain overstatements---for instance one (in an article on
     Mandel that came out last week) that claims just the opposite of
     DeAngeli--that no true poet should or would (though could) squander
     his life away on textual exegesis...etc...
     Thanks, gary, for filling me in. Chris

Carl:   (re: "Simplify!  Simplify!")

        Thoreau referred specifically to material culture--trains, telegraphs,
all the little boxes into which we civilizands stow pieces of our lives--not
to his writing, which he viewed as transcendent thereof.  You think _Walden_
is simple?  Guess again.

        I don't believe I distorted your words at all, the way I read them back
to you.  Of course I knew it wasn't what you *thought* you were saying.  You
thought to contradict my assertion (not "mine" in the sense of original with
me) that art's definition is constitutionally elusive, but instead you
illustrated it very well, thank-you.

        When you amend yourself to say "it has to have wonder for me . . .
else it aint art" I simply couldn't agree more.  That was my main point when
this started.  Wonder as a defining characteristic, however, has no explicit
connection to your previous wording, and it is but one defining marker, not, as
far as we can tell, a complete or exhaustive definition.  And what in the
world (or out of it, where so many imagine they can place themselves) leads
you to characterize wonder as simple?  Have a care, man.

        If I might intervene a bit further, I take it that what you "meant" was
something more like, "defining art is no problem for me because it's not my
job--I can recognize art, make art, and that's enough."  And that *is* enough,
provided it really isn't your job to try, knowing the historical difficulty,
to define it anyway.  Ignoring the historical difficulty won't make it go away.

Ed Foster's book *is* amazing and really engrossing, the poems tell
intricate stories and ask to be read and reread and rereread (and I'm
just at the reread stage, so I can't say anything more articulate right
now other than to thank the poet for doing this work on the page). The
printed cover is really strinkin; whoever did it must have sacrificed the
type to get so deep an impression, and I keep running my fingertips over
it and wondering if that's an intended part of the text itself, which
seems so much about pressure and touch and weight of past.

which brings me to sentiment: and Alan Sondheim's answer to Jordan:
"thrusts backwards with a whisper, that it is a memory of what we once
called truth"

It's a marked answer-- the "thrusts/backwards/truth" combo, I mean.
Isn't this more like the meaning of "nostalgia"? (And also, doesn't it
reinscribe the gender binary which usually comes into play, if only as an
initial point of reference, whenever 'nostalgia' is invoked?)

There has to be a way to hold onto 'nostalgia' without being
self-indulgent; in fact the nostalgic elements in a writer like...uh,
Joyce...are what first made the self-indulgent (as in, high-wire wonderful)
parts accessible for me.

But now I have a question-- a former student asked if it were possible
for a writer to"write beautifully about absolutely nothing." I told him to try
it... all the writers I could think of were writing "about" "nothing" qua
something... language, absence, estrangement, silence. Can anyone think
of a better response to this kid, I mean, beyond "try it"? "The bride is
never bare" [more nostalgia]?!

 so
 much

The central issue is the singularity of self.  We all do what we can to combat
this problem; there are as many "solutions" as there are poets.  For some
it may mean a formal meditation program to transcend the physical limits of
the self; for others it may mean process work or precompositional devices; for
others using found material, or just plain spending a lot of time listening
to found speech -- one could go on endlessly.

While I don't want to speak for Jackson Mac Low, when he told me that he both
started and stopped using chance operations because of a concern with
sentimentality, I believe he was trying to tell me that in the constant battle
against singularity of self there is no free lunch:  One cannot presume to
have simply solved this problem once and for all time by a single act of
invention.

I agree with you, Dodie, emotional substance -- per se -- is not a problem;
what is a problem is where you see that emotional substance sticking out like
bones from under the skin through gaps in what you had thought were reasonable
efforts to work against the singularity of self.

"fourW" is a small literary magazine edited by David Gilbey from the School
of Humanities and Social Science, Charles Stuart University, Wagga Wagga.
The title apostrophises Wagga Wagga Writers Writers and while there's a
particular desire to publish new work from the Riverina, like all small
magazines we consider and publish work from all over Australia (and overseas)

The most recent issue  Number 5 contains new work by Dorothy Porter, Kate
Llewellyn, Tim Thorne, Ken Bolton, Jeff Guess, Steve Evans, Adrian
Caesar and many more - runs to more than 150 pages.  We received
about 400 submissions and managed to publish about 100.  We don't
pay (can't - no funding) but aim to produce a fairly classy looking
mag.  Deadline for this next issue - due out in the Spring - is 30
June.

Usually we like to receive MSS typed, double-spaced etc but you can
send it email if you like.

 To the Owner of the Poetics List.

           DEAR SIR AND KINSMAN.--Let us have done with this
 frivolous talk.  The Anti-Hegemony Project accepts contributions
 from me every year:  then why shouldn't it from Mr. Poe?  In all
 the ages, three-fourths of the practitioners of the great art of
 parody have been regular devils, as my archives will show:  then
 what becomes of the sting when that term is applied to the gifted
 Mr. Poe?  The AHP's wares are accumulated mainly from the
 graveyards.  Revisitation of an old crime and deliberate
 perpetration of a new one; for deceased's contribution is a
 slander of his heirs.  Shall the AHP decline bequests because
 they stand for these offences every time and generally for both?

           Allow me to continue.  The charge most persistently and
 resentfully and remorselessly dwelt upon is, that Mr. Poe's
 contributions are incurably tainted by bad faith--bad faith
 proved against him most recently by Mr. W.R. Titterton.  _It
 makes us smile_--down in my place!  Because there isn't a writer
 in cyberspace who doesn't exhibit bad faith in the daily disparity
 between public and private opinion.  They are all caked with
 bad faith, many layers thick.  Iron clad, so to speak.  If there
 is one that isn't, I desire to acquire him for my museum, and
 will pay Dinosaur rates.  Will you say it isn't infraction of
 ethics, but only a kindly evasion?  Comfort yourselves with that
 nice distinction if you like--_for the present_.  But by and by,
 when you arrive, I will show you something interesting:  a whole
 hell-full of evaders!

           To return to my muttons.  I wish you to remember that
 my bad-faith writers are contributing to the Anti-Hegemony
 Project with frequency:  it is writing filched from the sworn-off
 public honesty; therefore it is the wages of sin; therefore it is
 my writing; therefore it is _I_ that contribute it; and, finally,
 it is therefore as I have said:  since the AHP daily acccepts
 contributions from me, why should it decline them from Mr. Poe--or
 Mr. Twain--who are each as good as I am, let Mr. Titterton say
 what he will?

Carl,

Sorry I forgot so quickly your source.  I lose track easily apparently.
 Usually think of what's called "myself" as a spreading field composed of
brief glints of recognition melded with darker areas of "oh yeah" and lots of
blank that never get known in any "recognizable" ways.  But knowing is a
deepness we aren't exactly familiar with or even always aware of.  I'm
satisfied with letting experiences percolate into aquifers deeper than can
always be retrieved in the forms they had when they seeped in.  They surface
transformed in memory & my writing.

Best,

Carl,

Thanks for putting those quotes on art & aesthetics out.  As usual, I find I
agree and disagree with various points taken in various ways in all of them.
 And all of them are pertinent and provoking.

There is a point of view from which one can say that all our productions are
"muzak" or decoration, just as there are other points of view from which one
can say that any individual production has important contributions to make to
our awareness of our situation.  There is a point of view that allows us to
state (and feel) that art is the production and embodied realization of
difference, and of the intertwined difference (multiplicity) in unity.
 Everywhere is the center.  Centers everywhere radiating.  And etc.

I say the real is anything we go through, all our experiences.  I say even
what we imagine we cannot imagine is the real.  What is unimaginable is
equally real in its way as the pain we feel when we cut a finger or lose a
loved one.

Yes, a definition of quality that I can agree with. The constant movement
beyond, before that which is, is even set down.
Artaud said, "x clear ideas are ideas that are dead and finished." This act
then would be what's after art, and any poetry or any other form would
reflect that, though there would be no absolute necessity to perpetuate the
forms, or calling what results by any single label. The point is, as you said
Hank, the disruption which is a joy, an exquisite agony I think. In our
recent e-mail discussions, Jim Leftwich speaks of "proprioceptive gnosis",
the nerves and muscle that drives, fuels the process. It is a form of living
that discharges as poetry or paint, or any medium and under any name, or lack
thereof - to constantly act beyond your own preconceptions, even beyond your
own perceptions. In a sense, if it doesn't kill you a little its not worth
living.

     from PARADOX AND EVOL
     by G.K. Bataille
     Kim Urizen, trans.

     In the midst of the rowdy imperial epic
     the blasted head flashes
     w/thrill on the lips. Each vein, a bayonet
     vibrates the latrine of the heart.
          --Ted Swinburne

     Why should a period of revolution lend a lustre to the arts and the
world of letters? Few events in e-space have a greater symbolic value than
the storming of the Poeticslist by Auntie Hegemony, despite the fact that
the "storming" was itself symbolic.  (Can one already inside the compound
be said to have "stormed" it?) My concern here is not with the mode of her
poetic realization, and the judgment must be that the realization is less
poetic, more intellectual. The contemplative _sees_. (Note the homophonic
"seize.")
     Auntie Hegemony is not so much great because of her published
achievement as great because she is right. Her achievement deserves a
homage less indiscriminate than it has yet been accorded; thus I do more
than praise what she wrote: I praise what she knew. She cannot be praised
too highly so long as praise is confined to what is praiseworthy. Her
especial gift was her physical intuition of being; her especial triumph
was her exploitation of paradox to embody that intuition.
     W.R. Titterton is a biographer, Uncle Edgar a critic, and both of
their limits are those of their respective professions. To cast, oneself
as with another, as "professional" -- and the biographer, the critic,
neither is more or less a "professional" than the academic or the
publisher -- is to cast limits. Titterton and Poe are both businessmen.
Titterton is an idiot. Edgar, a bitter materialist.
     Auntie Hegemony decided on an event that was to shake, if not to
deliver, the world. She appears to have employed the pipe used for
emptying dirty water as a loud speaker and one of her many provocative
actions was to yell out that the prisoners were being slaughtered. This
was truly a liberation, but in the cryptic sense of a dream, a dream of
"Evol" -- not quite Revolution or Evolution, not quite Evil, the mirror
image of Love (which is not Hate, but, simply, Evol).
     Q: Who is Satan?
     A: What is poetry?
     The grave filled in, sewn with acorns so that, in the future, the
ground will be covered with vegetation ...
     is/isn't poetry.
     My lips move as I write it down as it happens ...
     is/isn't poetry.
     What do you want? ...
     is/isn't poetry.
     The Hegelian may say that an egg is really a hen, because it is part
of an endless process of Becoming; the Berkeleian may hold that poached
eggs only exist as a dream exists; since it is quite as easy to call the
dream the cause of the eggs as the eggs the cause of the dream; the
Pragmatist may believe that we get the best out of scrambled eggs by
forgetting that they ever were eggs, and only remembering the scramble.
But no pupil of Auntie Hegemony needs to addle hir brains in order to
addle hir eggs; to put hir head at any peculiar angle in looking at eggs,
or squinting at eggs, or winking the other eye in order to see a new
simplification of eggs:
     A pose is a pose is a pose.
     The Auntie Hegemonist stands in the broad daylight of the brotherhood
of women, the sisterhood of men, in their common consciousness that eggs
are not hens or dreams or mere practical assumptions; but things attested
by the authority of the Senses:
     Appose is appose is appose.
     All poets are amateurs, white gleams of water that shine suddenly
like swords or spears in the green thickets.
     Can they honestly be compiled?

     Dear Poeticslist People:
     Due to a combination of outside forces (specifically, good weather,
bad finances and a backlog of things to attend to), I'll be temporarily
unplugging my Internet package, including Poeticslist. I'll have e-mail
for a couple more days at least (I have to cancel it by written request),
if anyone wants to get in touch with me that way. Otherwise, my address is
as follows:
     Gary Sullivan
     1506 Grand Avenue, #3
     St. Paul, MN 55105-2222
     Note that the above is also the address for Detour Press. If you'd
like to send poetry, fiction, drama, visual work, etc., for consideration,
send it to that address, and state, specifically, that you'd like what
you're sending to be considered for publication. (I get a lot of
manuscripts in the mail, and a couple years ago made the mistake of
"rejecting" something that hadn't been intended for publishing
consideration.) So, please, be specific with your intentions, if you'd
like your work considered for publication.
     Also, for those unfamiliar with the press, while I can't speak for my
co-editor Marta Deike, I tend to be generally interested in work of
"satirical nature." (Which isn't to say, strictly speaking, "satire.")
Marta has her own interests w/respect to the press; the things that we've
published constitute a common ground or compromise (take your pick) of our
combined interests. Also note:  we are only able to publish 1 or 2 books a
year; this limits the focus (and output) of the press considerably. We are
not (obviously) New Directions.
     I owe several of you on this list books; if I promised you them and
you haven't yet received them, you know who you are. I'll send them
shortly when I can afford to. (Not too long, I hope.) I also owe a number
of you responses to work, letters, etc.--you'll be hearing from me soon
via snail-mail.
     We're interested in exchanging books for other books or magazines;
so, anyone who wants any of the following, but would rather trade than
buy, send your wares w/an explanation that that's what you're doing, or
query first if you're more comfortable doing that.
     DARK DECADE, a novel (w/illustrations) by Johanna Drucker, 128 pp.,
1995, $10.95
     FEAR & PHILOSOPHY, fiction by Stephen-Paul Martin, 128 pp., 1994,
$8.95
     I SHOT THE HAIRDRESSER, fiction by David Gilbert, 128 pp., 1994,
$8.95
     SOUND OFF, poetry by Spencer Selby, 64 pp., 1993, $7.95
     We have a couple of other books planned -- if they come out & I'm not
on-line at that time, I'll have Spencer or someone post notices.

     Have fun, everyone, and remember: THERE IS NO ULTIMATE AUTHORITY.

     Yours,

     Gary

Dear John Byrum,
It's gone quiet this a.m. -- all the traffic going to Vancouver I guess.
Yesterday, looking at The Death of Eudamidas and the Extreme Unction
by Nicolas Poussin, it occurred to me to ask my students, some twenty
of them, if any of them had ever been at a death-bed. Not one and nor
have I and that makes it difficult to inhabit the figures of the
paintings in the way the painter and his contemporaries could. The
best I could manage that way was seeing my father barely conscious
after his last stroke in London, full of the usual tubes and wires.
The doctors had sat in committee and decided they
had to leave all the gear in place. When he made a partial recovery
he was not altogether pleased by their decision.
Arguments about the real branch out in all directions from there.

Best wishes to you and Generator Press.

QUEENSLAND STUDIES CENTRE ANNUAL CONFERENCE   8-9 JULY



WAR'S  END?


August 1945 marked the end of the most harrowing and transforming
collective experience in the history of modern Australia.  How much of the
'old' Australia came to an end with the cessation of hostilities, and how
much continued as before? What different meanings did the war's end have
for different groups and institutions in Australian society?

The Queensland Studies Centre will be holding its annual two-day
conference, in association with the History Department of James Cook
University in Townsville on 8-9 July of this year.

The conference will be interdisciplinary in scope,  embracing military,
social and cultural history; politics and political economy; literary and
cultural studies. Papers exploring any of the following aspects of the
topic would be welcome:

* literature and the arts
* education and social policy
* Aboriginal and ethnic communities
* women's history
* military and social history
* politics and industrial relations
* journalism and the media

Venue:  Townsville, Queensland.

Date:   8-9 July, 1995.

SYMPOSIUM: (POST) COLONIAL FICTIONS: RE-READING ELIZA FRASER AND THE WRECK
OF THE STIRLING CASTLE. University of Adelaide, 25-26 Nov., 1995.

Contact: Kay Schaffer, Department of Women's Studies, 08 303 5267 direct,
08 303 3345 FAX, e-mail: kschaffe@arts.adelaide.edu.au

Post-colonial studies within Australia have attempted to re-evaluate and
re- write colonial history to include those people either marginalised or
subjugated by the colonial process. This two day symposium will explore a
different aspect of post-colonial discourse through the exploration of one
of the best known events in Australian colonial history. In 1836 the
'Stirling Castle' was wrecked off the Queensland coast and many of the crew
together with the Captain's wife, Eliza, were marooned on Fraser Island.
Events surrounding the rescue of the castaways, in particular Mrs. Fraser,
received international media attention. In the last 160 years the story of
Eliza Fraser has become the subject of popular myth, fiction, opera, art,
film and scholarly research in the areas of cultural studies, literature,
history, anthropology, archaeology, women's studies, and the visual arts.
(Post) Colonial Fictions will examine critically the Eliza Fraser saga by
bringing together, for the first time, an interdisciplinary team of
academics, authors, artists and members of the Fraser Island community.
Discussions will include feminist analyses of the incident, textual and
iconographic representations of Aboriginal people, and Eliza Fraser as a
creative inspiration for the arts.

Speakers on 19th century ethnography, visual arts, and Fraser Island
history include: Ian Mc Niven, Lynette Russell, Rod McNeil, Olga Miller,
Elaine Brown; on 20th century cultural studies and Batdjala representations
include: Kay Schaffer, Sue Kossew, Jim Davidson, Jude Adams and Fiona
Foley. We are hopeful that the symposium will include an exhibition of
Fiona Foley's works and a performance by University of Adelaide
Conservatorium of Music students of the theatre opera: "Eliza Fraser Sings"
(arranged by Peter Sculthorpe/libretto by Barbara Blackman).
