The Poetry Center=2C San Francisco State University=2C is very honored to p=
resent the
first U.S. readings by Chilean poet Ra=FAl Zurita from his recent book INRI=
=2C as newly
translated from Spanish by Will Rowe=2C together with a public conversation=
 with the

rogram in our
two-year project=2C The Poetics of Healing=2C guest-curated by poet and sch=
olar Eleni
Stecopoulos=2C and supported by the Creative Work Fund.

"INRI responds to the need to find a language for an event that was kept
hidden and excluded from official records in Chile: the fact that the bodie=
s of
the disappeared were thrown out of helicopters into the mouths of volcanoes
and into the sea. In order to bring this event=2C that was neither seen nor
heard=2C into language=2C Zurita invents a form and language capable of bri=
nging
it into the present. The one place where these unspeakable acts might be
registered is in the landscape of Chile: the mountains=2C desert=2C and sea=
. There
the event might begin to be touched=2C heard=2C and finally seen. When ther=
e are
no places from which to speak=2C =91the stones cry out=92.

Zurita=92s INRI works with long breaths and large blocks of meaning:
intensities that overrun the usual measures of speech and syntax. To read i=
t
is to experience a strange force pulsing through the language=2C breaking a=
part
its usual channels=2C and opening unseen and unheard zones.

Ra=FAl Zurita=2C winner of the Chilean National Poetry Prize=2C is one of t=
he best
known poets of Latin America. His work is part of a revolution in poetic
language=2C that began in the 1970s and sought to find new forms of
expression=2C radically different from those of Pablo Neruda. The challenge=
 was
to confront the contemporary epoch=2C with its particular forms of violence=
=2C
including violence done to language.

"INRI is distinctive in that it does not speak out of individual sorrow=2C =
though
this is not missing from the work=2C but seeks=2C rather=2C a new space=2C =
out of
which love might be asserted as prime human reality=2C a space which might
give birth to a different type of society.=94 (William Rowe)

The NYT is featuring a page where readers can type in a word about their
feelings about today's economy. I like as many of us as possible to go to
that
page and enter the word "insouciant." If enough of us do that, the word will

join others (e.g. hopeful, sad, terrified) and scroll across the screen.

So, go now (yes, right now!) to this page--

http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/03/30/business/economy/2009-economy-words.html

and key in the word "insouciant." Let's not let the Gloomy Guses have their
way on this one.

Palm Press is pleased to announce the publication of:

Martyrdom by Anne Waldman

"With no small amount of  " investigative rage," Anne Waldman quickens =
the nerve fiber by which language so binds us to social action as to =
recast victim status and noble death in light of car bombings and global =
capital's "free trade of bodies." Martyrdom begins and ends in =
present-day Umbria to look back at the Cretaceous-Tertiary event, "the =
asteroid or impact that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs." That =
doomsday past lends longer historical views to measure the present =
delirious life in which we are all married to figures of the terrorist. =
An uncompromising assessment of emancipative politics and the doubtful =
certainties of poetry-Mansur Al-Hallaj, Santa Teresa of Avila, Ernesto =
Cardenal-to ask what desire has "to do with the subject of martyr? / =
[when] everyone has a price for suicide."--Roberto Tejada

Chapbook, 32 pages

prosody, rhyme, voice,  and affect. He writes a bi-monthly hip-hop column,
titled "In Extremis,"  for Montreal's city magazine, Maisonneuve (available
online  at www.maisonneuve.org). Most recently, Porco has published an

Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series dedicates itself to the
    study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The
    lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry Collection, at
  SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse formations, the
    status of ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions of literary
    production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between specific
  magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the
    little magazine functions in the making of the avant-garde.

books by Jules Boykoff, Brett Evans, Erica Kaufman, kathryn l. pringle and

The ArtsEdge Residency project is designed to encourage and support the=20

we offer two one-year residencies in a live/work space near Penn's
campus. ArtsEdge aims to support the creative work of young artists and
writers, and create a live/work environment that will inspire
interdisciplinary exploration.

Residencies last for one year and include a dedicated studio for each
writer/artist, living space, and close affiliation with the writing and
artistic communities at Penn. During the course of their residencies,
writers and artists will develop at least one collaborative project with

Two residencies are available, one for a visual artist and one for a
writer. The residences are not intended for current undergraduates. No
affiliation with Penn is necessary.

TERMS:

Each residency includes a one-bedroom apartment with an additional
studio space. Subsidized monthly rent on each one-bedroom apartment (for
which residents are responsible) is $400. Rent includes all utilities
(except phone) and wireless Internet. The Writers House, the Fine Arts
Department, and FRES will subsidize remaining rent.

MOVE-IN DATE: September 1, 2009

TO APPLY:

Hi All
I need to have a look at sample syllabi for a course on prosody at the
college sophomore level. Do any of you teach prosody as a separate
course? I have found the infamous Donald Justice course but I wonder if
there might be more interesting ways to study form and the history of
form?  Please back channel  mary.angeline@unco.edu  Thank you=20

Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Dear POETICS readers,

I'm researching contemporary "translocal" literature in Europe and am hoping
to find out if or where the term "translocal" has been similarly applied. I
first came across its application to literature on the (now defunct)
Bordercrossing Berlin's Wiki page, and their once-poetry editor Alistair
Noon elaborated somewhat on the term in the final issue, but it was mostly
self-referential. I am already aware of its anthropological origins, but am
wondering how far the term has reached in its application in/to
(contemporary) literature. I'd be curious to know if anyone else(where) has
picked up the topic. Please email me directly at megan@wordsinhere.com

Thanks,

Megan M. Garr

FROM DOO-WOP TO HIP- HOP: Interview with two generations of African=20
American Poets: Major Jackson and Afaa Michael Weaver.

By Doug Holder


Afaa Michael Weaver, 58 and Major Jackson, 40 are two major African =96
American poets from two different generations, but they both continually =
feed=20
from their shared heritage, and the continuum of the Black experience in=20=

America. Weaver, a professor of English at Simmons College in Boston, a=20=

recent Pushcart Prize winner, and the author the critically acclaimed poe=
try=20
collection: =93 Plum Flower Dance=94 (U/Pitt), and Major Jackson, the aut=
hor=20
of =93Hoops,=94 an asst. professor at the University of Vermont and a cor=
e faculty=20
member at the Bennington Writing Seminars, met for a filmed discussion at=
 the=20
Somerville Community Access TV studios. The show was moderated by Gloria=20=

Mindock (Cervena Barva Press) and produced by Doug Holder (Ibbetson St.=20=

Press).

Weaver started off the discussion by going back to his native Baltimore i=
n=20
1970. This was a time when he dropped out of the university, got a job at=
 a=20
steel mill, and started to pen his seminal poems. Later he joined the mil=
itary,=20
married his first wife, but was destined to live a radically different li=
fe than his=20
early years indicated.

Jackson was born in Philadelphia, and studied to be an accountant. He got=
 an=20
internship in which he was spending up to 80 hours a week with spreadshee=
ts.=20
After college he worked at an arts center in the city in the role of fina=
nce=20
manager. He said: =94 I was happy when I was fired.=94 He had taken some =
poetry=20
courses in college, and he started to program poetry events at the center=
. He=20
soon realized it was the arts that touched him spiritually, and he eventu=
ally=20
made poetry a part of his everyday life.

Weaver talked of his early days in East Baltimore in the 50=92s and 60=92=
s. He sort=20
of free- associated about mowing grass with push lawnmowers and the ritua=
ls=20
of his youth, like using toothbrushes to clean his shoes before a night o=
ut on=20
the town. Weaver said: =93Baltimore was a very Southern city. We weren=92=
t=20
allowed to shop in the stores in downtown Baltimore=97the line between bl=
ack=20
and white were clearly drawn.=94

Weaver said his father=92s family was from Southern farming stock, and hi=
s dad=20
had the philosophy that =93 Children should she be seen not heard.=94 Wea=
ver=20
learned to become an =93isolated=94 learner, he recollected.

In 1963 he was bused to a white school, which caused a great deal of anxi=
ety=20
for the young poet. It was hard to be in a place where he was not welcome=
d.=20
He was always glad and relieved to be back on his own side of town. At th=
e=20
time his scope of experience was limited. He thought the whole world was=20=

Black. Weaver laughed: =93I watched =93 Leave it to Beaver,=94 and though=
t that=20
family was just like mine, except they were white.=94

Jackson said even though Philadelphia was north of Baltimore, it still po=
ssessed=20
a Southern sensibility. This was confirmed when he spent his summers in=20=

Nashville, Tennessee as a boy and he experienced the same =93rhythms=94 a=
s the=20
South.

Jackson described himself as a hyperaware kid. He was tuned in to the mus=
ic=20
and the culture of the time. Hip- Hop started to appear in 1978-82, and d=
rugs=20
started appearing in the mix. There was a potent combination of rich cult=
ure=20
and tragic lives. He sadly watched the erosion of his neighborhood over t=
he=20
years.

Jackson=92s work is informed by his observations of people trying to surv=
ive=20
under extreme stress. Anything that cuts humans down, be it in an urban o=
r=20
rural setting, will find room in his work, he said. All in all Jackson is=
 grateful to=20
have grown up in Philadelphia. He had an appreciation of the speech, jarg=
on,=20
and music of the milieu.

Jackson reflected on his neighborhood:=94 People all knew each other. The=
 guy=20
at the corner drug store and the drug dealer on the corner.=94 Jackson kn=
ew=20
who to avoid and who could act as a role model.

Weaver brought the discussion back to the pivotal year 1968. This was the=
=20
year Martin Luther King was assassinated. Weaver=92s younger siblings wer=
e=20
born in 1969 and 1973. He said he was able to see the effect the legacy o=
f=20
those years had on them, and how it changed them. Weaver vividly=20
remembers his mother crying like a proverbial baby when MLK was shot.

Weaver went further back to the 1965 riots in Baltimore. He remembered th=
e=20
intrusion of the National Guard in his neighborhood. He can recall whites=
=20
roaming the streets looking for blacks to beat up. He remembers hearing=20=

gunfire from his two- story row house. Weaver said:=94 It was horrifying.=
 The=20
cities never recovered from the 60=92s=97and later they became plagued by=
=20
drugs. The post-industrial era brought the loss of blue-collar jobs. Crim=
e=20
flooded the community.=94

Weaver reminisced about the downfall of Milton Ave, where he grew up.=20
Blockbusting tactics by real estate developers drove whites out. The patt=
erns=20
of parenting changed. There were more divorced parents. The old family=20=

structure fell. More men of color were incarcerated.

Weaver eventually left the steel mill and worked for Proctor& Gamble.=
 Once,=20
while driving to work he took a route down Milton Ave. with a friend and =
saw a=20
man shot down dead. This really hit home as to how the times had changed.=


Jackson said that music had a decided influence on him and his work. On o=
ne=20
hand he celebrates the music of Elvis, but realizes the roots of Rock=92n=
 Roll is=20
with the Blues, which was African-American music. He was introduced to bl=
ack=20
history by an aunt who gave him a history book that traced the long list =
of=20
accomplishments of the black race through the centuries. He learned about=
=20
celebrated African Americans like Robert Hayden, poets Gwendolyn Brooks,=20=

Langston Hughes as well others. He also loved the music of the 60=92s lik=
e James=20
Brown and his anthem of a song =93I=92m black and I=92m proud.=94

Weaver said the =93big book=94 when he was growing up was the bible. He h=
ad a=20
recent discussion with the poet James Tate, who also touted the influence=
 of=20
the =93good book.=94 Later his mother bought enclyopedias from the superm=
arket=20
for 25 cents a piece. As for the Blues, it came naturally. The cadence of=
 his=20
father=92s speech was very Blues- like, Weaver said. Weaver loved the=20
Temptations, The Supremes, The Impressions and other groups of the era. H=
e=20
wore highbrow collars, there was =93 a soundtrack to my life=94 he smiled=
. Hip-Hop=20
hit the scene when he was 30 or so, so he was able to appreciate it.

Weaver talked about the changes in the culture due to the turmoil in the=20=

cities. He said the parlance of the Blackman changed. The language used w=
as=20
of the type that would not be tolerated years before. The Civil Rights=20=

Movement opened up what was an essentially insular black society. From th=
is=20
instability came Gangsta Rap, and the idolization of the drug culture.

Jackson, through his elders, was exposed to the music of the 60=92s. He u=
sed to=20
listen to a radio show hosted by =93Butterball=94 that played that genre =
of music.=20
Books were ubiquitous in his household. His grandmother built a sprawling=
=20
library in the home from used books that she bought. Literature was=20
important. His stepfather=92s sister worked at the Philadelphia Museum of=
 Art,=20
and Jackson recollected: =93 I made it my playground=94 He had the images=
 of=20
Duchamp, Lichtenstein, and others seared into his nascent consciousness.

His grandfather had a deep appreciation for African-American music, and h=
is=20
grandmother loved Gospel. He got to see the great vibraphonist Lionel=20
Hampton with his grandfather. He had a piano in his house, and he too had=
 a=20
soundtrack to his life.

Jackson said the avant-garde musician Sun Ra lived a few blocks away in=20=

Germantown. He said: =93: You could hear his group play=97unlike anything=
 I=20
heard before. It was free jazz, a big band sound, way outside the norm.=94=
=20
Jackson said he appreciated Sun Ra=92s journey, a man who created this=20=

mythology of the musician as an alien being. Both poets agreed that=20
mythology that artists like Sun Ra draped around themselves was a reactio=
n=20
to a world that rejected them and made them suffer. Sun Ra, and others of=
=20
his ilk didn=92t want to be part of a society such as this, and in effect=
 divorced=20
themselves from it.

Finally both men talked of mentors. And it was clear without mentors thes=
e=20
men=92s lives would be quite different. Weaver defines a mentor as=94 A f=
riend who=20
reserves the right to tell you what to do.=94 Jackson mentioned Amiri Bar=
aka and=20
Sonia Sanchez as well as Weaver, as major influencers in his writing life=
.=20
Weaver talked about the poet Lucille Clifton who advised him to read X.J.=
=20
Kennedy=92s =93Introduction to Poetry=94 and gently criticized and encour=
aged his=20
fledgling attempts at poetry. Both men are now in positions to give somet=
hing=20
back, and they do it as teachers, and in other roles. And hopefully, new=20=

generations will flow back and forth and nurture each other, like they ha=

Buddy Bolden speaks from the insane asylum

It don't go that way, upside the wall,
down to the woodwork, falling all over
where the wood in the floor breaks off from
the C note. It's more like this, the way
I lean up under the last star on Orion
in the first break of spring, under the catcalls
of mockingbirds, the belly grunts of air
knotted up inside me. Like it was
this morning, the sheets full of years of me,
the dipper back down in the bucket to wash
my dreams until they make sense. Marie=20
Laveau or her familiar comes back=20
again, a voice with no body. Then the roar
from the hoodoo and gooba dust, the hammer
nailed to the tree on a piece of cloth
with dry blood, the valley of full moons
like a python belly writhing, full of some
still living thing. Jazz, make the
water one tongue, rise up, rise up,
soprano sorceress, sing to the ancient pain
all around me, the chorus of how time began.
O water, breathe, so the dead can listen.




II

Children in superdomes

This old lady's hand is weaker than mine,
and I ain't used to so many people close
to breaking, and everybody is so wet.
When I look back to where we used to live,
all I see is the way water stand up and be
talking to you, stand up like it can dance
all over the world. It's so much stuff in here,
and I am just a little girl trying to help this
white lady in this wheelchair of hers.
People get so loud in here I can't hear myself.
Tonight, when I go to sleep, I'm gonna
count all the things I remember that we had
and hope my sister bring them when she come
back. She better come back. I am gonna count
my handmade dolls the Vietnam lady
gave me, plus all the books I had about dolphins
because they are the best. Then I'll be sleepy
and won't hear nobody crying in here where
everything is all piled up, like we all finished
and there ain't nothing else to do, forever.

Indian Song=20
Freddie Hubbard=97s playing the cassette deck
Forty miles outside Hays and I've looked at
This Kansas sunset for three hours now,
Almost bristling as big rigs bounce and grumble
Along I-70. At this speed cornfields come
In splotches, murky yellows and greens abutting
The road's shoulder, the flat wealth of the nation whirring by.
It's a kind of ornamentation I've gotten used to=97
As in a dream. Espaliered against the sky's blazing=97
Cloud-luffs cascade lace-like darkening whole fields.
30,000 feet above someone is buttering a muffin.
Someone stares at a SKYPHONE, and momentarily=97
A baby=97s cry in pressurized air. Through double-paned squares
Someone squints: fields cross-hatched by asphalt-strips.
It is said C=E9zanne looked at a landscape so long he felt
As if his eyes were bleeding. No matter that. I'm heading west.
It's all so redolent, this wailing music, by my side
you fingering fields of light, sunflowers over earth,
miles traveled, a patchwork of goodbyes.

ix. To Afaa Michael S. Weaver=20

Bless your gnarled hands, Sir, and their paternal blues.
Tonight Kala grazes a palm over a battered face,
feeling his new-born features in a Correctional zoo.
The shock is permanent like the caged primate
who suddenly detects he=97s human. A HOMO ERECTUS=20
stands upright on guard outside his cell.
For the record, good friend, tropes are brutal,
relentless, miraculous as a son=97s birth. KING KONG=97S=20
memoir gets repeated on the evening news
like a horror flick, and everywhere dark men
are savagely ambushed. So, when a woman strolls
towards a homeless BIGGER, the audience
tenses up involuntarily beneath a cone of light.
This is the work of blockbusters: Kala=97s groan
twisting on a steel cot, and by morning=97s sunlight,
your cramped hand. Pages pile to a tome
on a kitchen table; its defense is three-fifths
human, two-fifths man. I await its world premiere;
till then, when the soul hears of black guards who strike
harder, the brain goes arthritic, tropes proliferate,
and a wide screen blooms with images of heavy-weights
whose gloved-hands struggle to balance a pen.

An evening of poetry at City Lights Bookstore *(261 Columbus at Broadway)*:
Micah Ballard, Andrew Joron, & David Meltzer
Monday, April 13, 2009, 7:00 P.M.

*Micah Ballard *

reading from *Parish Krewes * published by Bootstrap Press

**

*Andrew Joron *

reading from The Sound Mirror  published by Flood Editions

**

*David Meltzer*

reading from selected works

**

*Micah Ballard* lives in San Francisco. Recent books of his include
Absinthian Journal, Negative Capability in the Verse of John Wieners, In th=
e
Kindness of Night, Death Race V.S.O.P. (with Cedar Sigo & Will Yackulic),
Evangeline Downs, and the recent collection, Parish Krewes. He is co-editor
for Auguste Press and currently works for the MFA in Writing Program at USF=
.

**

*Andrew Joron* has been called "the metaphysician-elect of contemporary
American poetry" (Cal Bedient, Boston Review). Joron's latest poetry
collection is The Sound Mirror, published by Flood Editions. Joron's work
shows the ifluence of surrealism, science fiction, and German Romanticism.
He attended the University of California at Berkeley, where he majored in
philosophy of science. After a decade and a half spent writing
science-fiction poetry, culminating in his volume Science Fiction
(Pantograph Press, 1992), Joron began to elaborate other forms of lyric
speculation. This work has been collected in The Removes (Hard Press, 1999)
and in Fathom (Black Square Editions, 2003). The Cry at Zero, a selection o=
f
his prose poems and critical essays, was published by Counterpath Press in
2007. Joron is also the translator, from the German, of the Marxist-Utopian
philosopher Ernst Bloch=92s Literary Essays (Stanford University Press, 199=
8).

*David Meltzer* is poet and musician of the Beat Generation and San
Francisco Renaissance. Lawrence Ferlinghetti has described him as "one of
the greats of post-World-War-Two San Francisco poets and musicians" Meltzer
came to prominence with inclusion of his work in the anthology *The New

A haptic/text blog review of Kit Robinson, Lewis Warsh, and Bill
Berkson reading for the San Francisco State Poetry Center this past
Saturday night.

Haptics: The First 100 Days of President Obama
(haptics & commentary - sometimes minimal and sometimes expansive)
continues. It is now Day 76.=20

Note:Gallery Show: On April 29th, the 100th Day of Obama, the Steven Wolfe
Gallery (49 Geary Street, San Francisco), will exhibit all 100 drawings
in a 588 square foot grid upon one of the Gallery walls. A book - which
will be published by the Gallery on that day - will include 99 of the
drawings and edited texts from this blog. On that day, I will sit in
the Gallery and make the haptics and texts for the final two empty
pages for an edition limited to 35 copies. Subsequently a non-limited
edition will be produced with the final haptic and text,

If you are interested in either edition, or more information about the show=
,  please email me:

& yes,  please feel free to explore the entire blog for prior and ongoing=
=A0 Obama entries that precede this one!=20
 For those unfamiliar with this project, during these first 100 days of the=
 Obama regime, I have been making a haptic
drawing with reflective commentary - sometimes directly political,
sometimes not - on public and personal events of this unique period.
What is a haptic? I like to think of the drawings as a kind  of script, a p=
oetry without words.
On a most simple level, the drawings are a combination of the eye and
ear in sensual response to whatever may be in the immediate landscape -
the news, a basketball game, a poetry reading or musical performance, the s=
ounds coming in over the back porch,
etc.=20

Is This the Future of the Digital Book?

By BRAD STONE
Published: April 4, 2009
PLENTY of authors dream of writing the great American novel.

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/business/05stream.html

Noah Berger for The New York Times
Bradley Inman is starting Vook, a platform for e-books that will =20
combine text, video and social networking.

Bradley Inman wants to create great fiction, dramatic online video and =20=

compelling Twitter stream =97 and then roll them all into a multimedia =20=

hybrid that is tailored to the rapidly growing number of digital =20
reading devices.

Mr. Inman, a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur, calls this =20
digital amalgam a =93Vook,=94 (http://vook.tv) and the fledgling company =
=20
he has created with that name just might represent a possible future =20
for the beleaguered book industry.

Publishing, of course, is feeling the same chronic pain as other media =20=

businesses, with layoffs, corporate restructurings and a general sense =20=

of gloom, doom and kaboom settling over name-brand giants like Random =20=

House and Simon & Schuster.

At the same time, there has been a flurry of optimism and activity =20
around the once-derided idea that people might read books on a digital =20=

screen. Just this year, new electronic reading devices have emerged =20
from Amazon, Samsung and Fujitsu, while mobile phones like iPhone from =20=

Apple have flowered seemingly overnight into acceptable reading =20
devices for many bookworms.

And just as digital media have begun to change the nature of news, =20
music and video, the emergence of e-books is causing various =20
entrepreneurs and technologists to reconsider the kind of experience =20
that books might one day deliver.

Mr. Inman is among those reimagining the printed page. As the founder =20=

of HomeGain.com, an online real estate company which he sold to a =20
joint venture of newspaper companies in 2005, and TurnHere, a =20
production company that creates author videos for publishers, he has =20
deep ties in the publishing world of New York.

Last year, considering the opportunities that e-book devices like the =20=

Amazon Kindle might someday create, Mr. Inman wrote his own thriller, =20=

=93The Right Way to Do Wrong=94 and got TurnHere to film two dozen short =
=20
videos with actors that augment the book=92s main mystery. He recently =20=

began showing his Vook prototype to publishers as a way to hook them =20
and their established writers on the idea.

=93We think there=92s a real urgency in publishing to innovate with new =20=

kinds of content,=94 he says.

Vook tries to address a big problem for book publishers as they expand =20=

onto digital formats. For all the hype and initial success of devices =20=

like the Kindle, they threaten to strip traditional books of much of =20
their transportive appeal. Images on the jacket cover, inviting fonts =20=

and the satisfying feel of quality paper are all largely absent, =20
replaced by humdrum pixels on a virtual page.

Even worse, on multipurpose reading devices like the iPhone, more =20
immediately gratifying pastimes like video games are a click away for =20=

readers with short attention spans.

=93Publishers are going to be confronted with the idea that either the =20=

words on the page have to be completely compelling on their own, or =20
they have to figure out a way to create new sorts of subliminal draws =20=

in the new medium,=94 said Sara Nelson, the former editor of Publishers =20=

Weekly and a publishing industry consultant.

Ms. Nelson has seen the Vook prototype and says it is intriguing, but =20=

the challenge is to avoid feeling gimmicky. =93If you are going to put =20=

video in a book, it has to flow so naturally into the story that =20
readers don=92t even realize they are switching mediums,=94 she said.

A raft of similar efforts and experiments are under way. WEBook, a =20
venture-backed start-up in New York, allows people to collaborate on =20
writing books and is working on new ways to let readers give writers =20
real-time feedback on their work.

Wattpad, based in Toronto, is among several start-ups soliciting the =20
work of unpublished authors, giving them a route around the big book =20
companies and then distributing their writing on the Web and on mobile =20=

phones. Wattpad draws its revenue from advertising and, for now at =20
least, does not pay the authors.

Last week, Fourth Story Media, a company created by Lisa Holton, a =20
former executive vice president of Scholastic Inc., publisher of the =20
=93Harry Potter=94 franchise, began testing the Web site of what it is =20=

calling the Amanda Project, with a limited number of users.

The site draws content and themes from Fourth Story=92s series of =20
teenage books (about a girl named Amanda), which HarperCollins will =20
begin publishing this fall. Soon on the site, with a coming iPhone =20
application, readers will be able to create their own characters, =20
upload artwork and follow clues that relate to the books=92 overarching =20=

narrative.

=93This is a new kind of storytelling for kids who are growing up using =20=

technology and being formed by it in ways we can=92t even imagine,=94 =
Ms. =20
Holton said. =93We are inviting them to collaborate and participate.=94

ALL of this experimentation is sure to unleash serious debate in =20
literary circles. Tradition-minded readers might resist the notion of =20=

stories gussied up with potentially gratuitous video and encumbered =20
with the need for conversations between writer and reader.
And they are sure to ask: Would we have classics like =93The Great =20
Gatsby=94 if F. Scott Fitzgerald was distracted by the need to give =20
Gatsby a Twitter account?
=93I don=92t think we are compromising the written word,=94 says Mr. =
Inman =20
at Vook. =93People will to continue to read, just in new ways. Books are =
=20
finally coming online but they are very one-dimensional. I think we =20
can experiment and do this better.=94

Look what the winter snow blew in!?!?...A brand new issue of textsound,
spring-fresh for your ears and minds.

Featuring work by Linh Dinh, Joseph Lease, Cynthia Nelson, Paul DeMarinis,
Joe Wenderoth, Kenward Elmslie, Patrick Durgin and many more.  Issue 3 has,
to name a few, conceptual work, chance operations, barbaric yawps, Danish
funk-blues, found trucks, recycled music, stinky gods, and even a poem
written by the editors using chance operation.

Cue editor Laura Wetherington, who penned this issue's editor's note:
"We're still settling in as a group of promulgators in this electrical
forest. The conversation continues amongst the collective about the range
of our tastes and how they map onto/create the textsound project, but we're
doing that hard work of articulating the =93why=94 of what we choose or
don't choose, and starting to define some of the ground on which the
magazine stands. The tracks we've included in this issue, then, are a
reflection of this collage of our (sometimes differing, sometimes
overlapping) approaches to the avant-gardes, music, poetry, ideas, and punk
approaches to art. You can read more about our individual tastes in the
=93about us=94 section."

Please spread far & wide!

The mightiest, most rockingest, most Vikingest, most bestester, most
glorious representation of that most glorious moment in the history of our
coldest people, Durham's own *High Master!* will bring its thunderous and
glorious noise to *The Pinhook Bar this Saturday Night, April 11, 10 pm!!*

With special guests Pink Flag (http://www.reverbnation.com/pinkflag) & Rat
Jackson (http://www.reverbnation.com/ratjackson)<http://www.reverbnation.co=
m/ratjackson%29>
!!

Rejoice & Dress Like a Viking, Durham!

Who: High Master!, Pink Flag, Rat Jackson
What: Viking Rock Opera that Rivals even Thor's Thunderous Bolts!
When: This Saturday, April 11, 10 pm!
Where: The Pinhook Bar, 117 W. Main St., Durham, NC! (
http://thepinhook.com/thebardetials.htm)
Why: Because you'll only be bludgeoned to death by Viking Rock once!!

About HIGH MASTER!

Sprung from the hockey & blow torch addled brain of Mr. Chris Huggins (by
day, a jr. high science teacher; by night, a rabid fiend of rock goodness),
HIGH MASTER! is the true story of the most awesome, most rockingest, most
mighty viking to have ever lived! Forget Thor (weakling), forget Odin (sap)=
,
forget Hercules (okay, he's Greek, but forget that mama's boy anyway), High
Master! would have put them all under his thumb with just his pinky!

And yet, before he was so great High Master! faced a challenge that he was
not sure he could overcome: the dreaded, the evil, the dark, the foul, the
stinky, the annoying, the pesky, the dastardly, the criminal, the unkind,
the unthrifty, the really just generally bad DARK LORD UNGR (with an umlaut
(aka: Paul Overton: crafter-genius & artist relations el capit=E1n)).

After an epic battle, Dark Lord Ungr (with an umlaut) froze our hero High
Master! deep in the icy clutches of a mighty glacier! and with his mighty
evil, dreaded, stinky, annoying, etc. power, stole the sun and ruled the
earth and subjected all living beings to the most horrendous music
imaginable! It was a dark, dark, dark future....

And then! in the year 2455! the brave and noble and handsome and intelligen=
t
and admirable and handsome and kind to puppies and fearless and generally
awesome DR. SCIENTIST, PH.D (aka: Ken Rumble: poet, marketer, dad, biped)
whose shiny green suit gave him enormous powers of power! invented a time
machine called the Ship of Sound!! But doomed was all mankind because Dr.
Scientist, Ph.D couldn't find a power source strong enough to make the ship
go! Until, one day, while wandering amongst the boulders of the wasteland o=
f
the future he spied--locked in the icy grip of a mighty glacier--HIGH
MASTER!

Here, of course, was the power source the Scientist had long been searching
for! He thawed out High Master!, taught him the fighting art of Kung Future=
,
put a guitar in his hand, and together, they rocked back thousands of years
in time to confront, again, the evil, hideous, etc. etc. DARK LORD UNGR
(with an umlaut)!!!

And High Master and Dark Lord Ungr (with an umlaut) engaged in a most
ferocious battle! Their blows split mountains, their kicks cracked planets,
their swords sang out a bloody symphony of rampant destruction!!

And after days and days and days of battle, it was still unclear who had
won!!! Would it be High Master!?!!???? Would it be (eeek!) the Dark Lord
Ungr (with an umlaut)??!!???!!

Only the DICE OF FATE! will reveal!!!!!

Regardless, the YETIS!! party and dance and party and dance and dance and
party!! Why??!! Becuase THEY'RE YETIS!!!! Whooooo! for the YETIS!!

Some say (whisper even at times) that High Master and his brave crew
encountered other masters of musical mayhem on their adventures -- rumors
(scarcely to be believed) include names like Rainbow Pony Squad, Future
Corpse, Pep=E9 La Douche, and Def Sentence, heroes, too, in their own right=
,
but that, my friends, is a story for another day.....

<Archiving Writers' Work in the Age of E-Mail

  Digital preservation lets scholars learn more than ever about authors
  By STEVE KOLOWICH

  Leslie Morris is used to handling John Updike's personal effects. For
decades, Mr. Updike had been sending a steady stream of manuscripts and pap=
ers to
Harvard University's Houghton Library, where Ms. Morris serves as a curator=
=2E

  But in late February, several weeks after the iconic writer died, some bo=
xes
arrived with unexpected contents: approximately 50 three-and-a-halfand
five-and-a-quarter-inch floppy disks=C2=A0=E2=80=94 artifacts from late in =
the author's career
when he, like many of his peers, began using a word processor.
  The floppies have presented a bit of a problem. While relatively modern t=
o
Mr. Updike=C2=A0=E2=80=94 who rose to prominence back when publishers were =
still using
Linotype machines=C2=A0=E2=80=94 the disks are outmoded and damage-prone by=
 today's standards.
Ms. Morris, who curates modern books and manuscripts, has carefully stored =
them
alongside his papers in a temperature-controlled room in the library "until
we have a procedure here at Harvard on how to handle these materials."

  Harvard isn't the only university puzzling over new media from old=C2=A0=
=E2=80=94 and
not-so-old=C2=A0=E2=80=94 masters. Emory University recently received four =
laptops, an
external hard drive, and a Palm Treo personal digital assistant from Salman=
 Rushdie.
The University of Texas at Austin recently acquired a series of Zip disks a=
nd
a laptop containing Norman Mailer's files.

  "Once we learned how to preserve paper, we were good," says Naomi L. Nels=
on,
interim director of the manuscript, archives, and rare-book library at Emor=
y
University's Robert W. Woodruff Library. "That really hasn't changed a lot.
With computers it's a whole different ballgame."

  Still, three things are becoming clear. First, these trappings of the
digital age will transform the way libraries preserve and exhibit literary
collections. Second, universities are going to have to spend money on new e=
quipment and
training for their archivists. And finally, scholars will be able to learn
more about writers than they ever have before.

  In With the Old

  Personal computers and external storage devices have been around for more
than a quarter-century, but only now, as the famous literary figures of the=
 20th
century begin to pass away, are these technologies showing up on archivists=
'
doorsteps.

  According to Ms. Morris, the Updike papers will be the first in the Hough=
ton
catalog to have a "significant magnetic-media component," and she realizes
that old floppy disks are just the tip of the iceberg. The great American
novelists of the digital era=C2=A0=E2=80=94 the ones who own BlackBerrys, u=
se Gmail, Facebook,
and Twitter, and compose only on computer screens=C2=A0=E2=80=94 will soon =
begin shipping
their hard drives off to university libraries.

  What happens then is something much on the minds of Matthew G. Kirschenba=
um
(The Chronicle, August 17, 2007) and Douglas L. Reside. Both Mr. Kirschenba=
um,
associate director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humaniti=
es
at the University of Maryland, and Mr. Reside, an assistant director at the
institute, possess the collection of skills that may eventually be required=
 of
all 21st-century curators. In addition to holding doctorates in English, th=
ey
are computer experts.

  The institute, located in an austere warren of offices in the basement of
the university's McKeldin Library, houses a mix of sleek new machines and c=
lunky
old ones. An easy office-chair roll away from his newest computer sits Mr.
Kirschenbaum's oldest one: a small, gray box known as the Apple II. Mr. Res=
ide's
office contains similar artifacts, including a Commodore 64 gaming console.

  Amid the institute's state-of-the-art machines, these ridiculous-looking
antiques are stark reminders of how rapidly computer technology has evolved=
,
producing one of the major challenges of preservation in the digital age:
compatibility.

  The problem with the dizzying pace of computer evolution is that new
machines are often incapable of learning old tricks=C2=A0=E2=80=94 even if =
the tricks are not
really that old. For instance, most new computers don't come with floppy-di=
sk
drives. And while Harvard will surely procure machines that can safely read=
 Mr.
Updike's disk-based papers, what if those papers were trapped inside an eve=
n
older storage device=C2=A0=E2=80=94 say, something resembling a Commodore 6=
4 game cartridge?
Future archivists must have the skills to retrieve them.

  Brave New World

  Archivists must also know how to transfer their data to new machines, sin=
ce
old machines can survive for only so long before their circuits give out.

  That, Ms. Nelson says, calls for people with intimate knowledge of how th=
e
new stuff works, plus the resourcefulness to retrofit modernity's round hol=
es
to accommodate antiquity's square pegs. "We're still going to need people w=
ho
are experts in the history of the book, people who study handwriting, organ=
ize
paper collections, handle obsolete video formats, traditional photography. =
=2E..
We're going to do everything we've been doing, and then we're going to be
doing this."

  Ms. Nelson understands this better than most: While Mr. Updike's floppy
disks at Harvard probably contain simple text documents, the digital device=
s Mr.
Rushdie donated to Emory contain entire ecosystems of data.

  Writers today do a lot more on computers than they used to, and modern
devices hold a lot more information about their users than old ones did. Th=
e laptop
(and now the mobile device) has become the locus of social life as
correspondence has migrated from letters and phone calls to e-mail and text=
 chatting.
Recreational reading and research have also increasingly moved to the Web.

  Since a laptop logs basically everything its user does, preserving these
data environments will allow the scholars of the future unprecedented insig=
ht
into the minds of literary geniuses. "It's basically like giving someone th=
e keys
to your house," says Mr. Kirschenbaum.

  The influence of authors' environments on their writing has always
interested scholars. Marcel Proust, for example, is known to have been heav=
ily
influenced by the paintings he surrounded himself with when he penned the n=
ovel
Remembrance of Things Past, between 1909 and 1922. Imagine if Proust had be=
en
writing 100 years later, on a laptop: What else we might be able to learn a=
bout his
creative process.

  The implications for scholarship are tremendous, Mr. Kirschenbaum says. T=
ake
a great digital-era author: "You could potentially look at a browser histor=
y,
see that he visited a particular Web site on a particular day and time," he
says. "And then if you were to go into the draft of one of his manuscripts,=
 you
could see that draft was edited at a particular day and hour, and you could
establish a connection between something he was looking at on the Web with
something that he then wrote."
  In some cases, computer forensics can even hint at an author's influences
beyond the screen. Mr. Reside recently mined data from old equipment belong=
ing
to Jonathan Larson, the late composer and playwright who earned a Pulitzer
Prize posthumously for the musical Rent. In an early draft, Larson had a ch=
aracter
suggest that the moonlight coming through the window is really "fluorescent
light from the Gap." In the final draft, the lyric was "Spike Lee shooting =
down
the street."

  "From the time stamp on the digital files," Mr. Reside says, "I learned t=
hat
the lyric was changed in the spring of 1992 ... when, I believe, Spike Lee
was shooting Malcolm X in New York City."

  A Deluge of Data

  That is really just scratching the surface. Imagine how mapping the conte=
nt
of an author's Facebook profile, MySpace page, Flickr account, or Twitter f=
eed
might help scholars dissect that author's life and letters. The social-medi=
a
generation has developed a habit of casually volunteering biographical
information. When the great authors of that generation emerge, scholars may=
 be
pleased to find plenty of fodder for study already on the public record.

  But that is where things get tricky. Information that lives inside a
writer's personal hardware=C2=A0=E2=80=94 like the data on Mr. Updike's flo=
ppy disks or Mr. Rush
die's hard drives=C2=A0=E2=80=94 may not have physical dimensions, but it i=
s at least
attached to a single device that is owned by somebody. "It's physically her=
e," says
Mr. Kirschenbaum, gesturing toward a shelf of Apple Classic computers, dona=
ted
to the Maryland institute by the poet Deena Larsen. "I can wrap my arms aro=
und
it."

  Not so with e-mail and social-media content. These are not programs run o=
n
individual computers; they are Web-based services, hosted remotely by compa=
nies
like Facebook and Google. The content exists in an ethereal mass of data
known in information-technology circles as "the cloud." There, Mr. Kirschen=
baum
says, "you get into this wilderness of competing terms of service."

  With more and more information being stored on the Web, it is no longer
clear who owns what.
  For example, in February, Facebook rewrote its terms of service to stake =
a
claim on all content that users put on their profiles. After a backlash, th=
e
company hastily backed off and reiterated that users own their own profile
content. But the case is a reminder of the fluidity and ambiguity of owners=
hip laws
in the dawning era of shared media.

  "Consumers don't really know their rights here, and many are so wowed wit=
h
the convenience that they aren't asking themselves the tough questions yet,=
"
says Susan E. Thomas, digital archivist at the University of Oxford's Bodle=
ian
Library. "Right now we can collect boxes from the attic, but if the family
request a cloud service to transfer the archive of their loved one to the B=
odleian
Library, will that happen? We haven't tried it yet, so I can't tell you."

  "That's sort of the brick wall that every archivist knows they're hurtlin=
g
toward at 100 miles per hour," says Mr. Kirschenbaum.

  No Manual

  Many other questions also remain unanswered. For example, how much
information is too much? A 20th-century author's personal papers might be o=
f manageable
quantity=C2=A0=E2=80=94 say, what she was able to store in her attic. Digit=
al storage, on
the other hand, is cheap, easy, and virtually unlimited. Mining, sorting, a=
nd
archiving every bit of data stored an author's computers could become a cho=
re
of paralyzing tedium and diminishing value.

  At present, researchers are wary of discarding anything. "The work of an
author over their entire lifetime is such a fraction of the space you have =
on a
server hard disk, so there's no reason to throw any of that away," says Mr.
Kirschenbaum. However, he added, unless scholars are able to find what they=
 want
in that sea of data, it is not worth archiving in the first place.

  The good news is that as computers are logging more data, reference
technology is growing more sophisticated. And Ms. Nelson suggests that the =
new tools
for interacting with born-digital artifacts=C2=A0=E2=80=94 including a wiki=
 functionality
that could allow researchers to annotate materials and share their insights=
 with
others=C2=A0=E2=80=94 may not be too far away.

  New tools and new training, however, mean new money. Richard Ovenden,
associate director of Oxford's Bodleian Library, says the speed at which
universities adopt digital curation may depend on their willingness to dive=
rt funds from
more traditional areas. And that could be at a slower pace than the speed o=
f
technological invention itself.

UC Press, publisher of my forthcoming Cuban Poetry anthology, has
asked for "e-mail lists where it might be useful to announce the
publication of the book." I only know of three, aside from this one::
Poetryetc, Wompo, and British and Irish Poetry. I truly need other
suggestions. The book should be of broad interest among poets and
poetry readers.

Thanks in advance.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

maybe it's asking too much, but if Ashberry could adopt a more worldy sensibility, and address something social,just once,  in the manner of, say, Rod Smith: here's a prose poem from "Deed," Smith's latest --  (line breaks not exact, but still reads well)--

Ted's Head

So there's this episode of Mary Tyler Moore where Ted's trying to get a raise & after finagling and shenaniganizing he puts one over on Lou & gets his contract changed to non-exclusive sos he can do commercials which is not cool w/Lou & the gang because Ted's  just a brainless gimp & it hurts the image of the news to have the anchorman selling tomato slicers & dogfood so Lou gets despondent because the contract can't be rescinded but then he gets mad & calls Ted into his office & says, "You're going to stop doing commercials, Ted" & Ted says "why would I do that Lou?" & Lou says "Because if you don't I'll punch your face out" & Ted says "I'll have you arrested" & Lou says "It'll be too late, your face will be broken, you're not gonna get too many commercials with a broken face now are you Ted?" & Ted buckles under to force & everybody's happy, except Ted but he's so dumb nobody cares & everybody loves it that Lou's not despondent anymore he's back to his
 brustling chubby loud loveable whiskey-drinking football-loving ways. Now imagine if Ted were Lou, if Ted were the boss. You know how incredibly fucking brainless Ted is, but let's imagine he understands & is will to use force. That's the situation we're now in as Americans.

utilizing the series structure as a framework for documentation and
investigation. Since 2005, Factory School has published twenty titles under
the *Heretical Texts *series banner, with future volumes appearing in 2010
and beyond. Volume 4 includes books by Jules Boykoff, Brett Evans, Erica

Isn't there a poet named Jon Ashberrry who does just that?  I think he's th=
e author of The Days of The Houseboat=2C if memory serves....

All joking aside=2C how does a poet or artist do something *just once* whic=
h is so different from a body of work over 50 years in the making?  Are you=
 really asking for this poet=2C whose name is Ashbery incidentally=2C to su=
ddenly turn around & write like Rod Smith?  That strikes me as just about a=
s silly as expecting Smith to write like Ashbery.

hi mark.  i'd think it'd be welcomed in political communities.  i'm sure
friends of mine in hawai'i would be interested in hearing about it, and
people here in california where i am now.  but they'd probably rather hear
from someone they know than from uc press...  best, gabrielle

"ashberrian"... I don't get how...

Hello, all!

CANNOT EXIST magazine will continue in 2009, though at half speed: just two=
 issues, lovingly edited and assembled by hand, instead of four.=A0 The qua=
lity will, we think, be even higher, though that's hard to imagine, given t=
he astonishing work we got last year.=20

You can subscribe for the 2009 run for a mere $12.50, shipping included.=20

There are still copies of the 2008 issues as well, but #1 and #3, in partic=
ular, are in short supply, so get 'em while you can!=A0 Buy all four for ju=
st fifteen bucks, and get 200 pages of strange, urgent, and occasionally pe=
rfect poetry.=20

Submissions are now open for issue 5, and will remain so through May 15th.=

Dear Steve
Nice poem. But, if you're going to have a pop at the man, spell his name
right for goodness sake.

I'm having a hard time getting into the good reads network.  It seems
very one way to me, author's promoting their books & people wanting
you to follow them.  Discussions also seem flat as well & one
dimensional as well.  Any secrets to figuring out where the action
is?  & maybe someone who is more active there could explain what
benefits they've derived.

Steve I'm not getting the comparison/contrast here.  There are MANY WAYS Rod
Smith is more interesting and frankly more useful to us as a poet than
Ashbery ever has been.

Although I DO LIKE the extra "r" you put into Ashbery's name, makes him a
nice new berry.  But WHAT ON EARTH would an Ash-berry taste like?
HMMMMMMmmmmMMmmMM?  Maybe like a flame-toasted strawberry, or sun-burnt
boysenberry?  Yes, sun-burnt boysenberry, I think that's about right, MMMMM
it's kind of DELICIOUS yes?  SUN-BURNT BOYSENBERRY CERAL RAGES!

I'm simply wish the guy (Ashberrrrrry) would leave his comfort zone, and st=
retch his sensibility, not so much write like Rod Smith (I stated all that =
rather poorly), but attempt to address issues outside the world of art and =
the inner gymnastics of his private horizon (hope the last phrase made sens=
e). Maybe he could try something vulgar such as reading the newspaper once =
in awhile and address something contemporary. Major poets used to do that s=
ort of thing. Yeats/Eliot/Pound, although the later 2, admittedly, were fla=
cky, still, they were involved in, ugh, worldy issues. In some ways, Ashber=
y strikes me as a daffy, new age kind of Rilke, which ain't bad, and the gu=
y is enormously gifted, but I think he could do more with his gifts.=20

Stephen Vincent
The First 100 Days of Obama

One-Day Exhibition
Wednesday, April 29, 11am-8pm
Opening Reception,
 6-8pm

Steven Wolf Fine Arts will mark day 100 of the Barack Obama
administration with a one-day show of drawings by the artist and poet
Stephen Vincent and their publication in a book titled The First 100
Days of Obama.

Vincent is making one abstract, black and white
ink drawing of the same size each day for the first 100 days of the
Obama administration as part of a series he calls haptics, a word that
describes how the body sensually responds to and interprets stimuli
from the outside world. Each drawing is captioned with the date,
location and a brief description of the goings-on around the artist at
the time of the drawing.

At approximately 10 x 7 inches, the drawings are close variations on a them=
e;
randomness tangles with predictability, abstraction with the faint hint
of a figure or symbol as they take their flat, pillow form. Like a
diary of meditations, they form a partial record of Vincent=E2=80=99s thoug=
hts
and movements on those days, and offer a stark contrast to the political ma=
chinations
taking place in Washington even as they temporally mirror them. Mounted
in a grid at the gallery, the drawings will cover 588 square feet of
wall space.

The show aspires to a nutty ceremonial numerology in
which the diurnal drawing process, the publication of the book and the
target day all harmonically converge. In order for Vincent to remain
true to the one-a-day drawing schedule and still make that deadline the
gallery will have to run a relay race with its digital publisher who
must turn around the final design, printing, binding and shipping in
under 24 hours=E2=80=94the frenetic busywork another mirror of the activity=
 in
Washington. The first 25 copies of the book will arrive in the gallery
with 99 images and one blank page. To draw the project to a close
Vincent will work all day in the gallery to create a unique work on
page 100 of these volumes. The remaining 75 books will be printed a few
days later with the full set of 100 reproductions.

The opening
will offer Vincent and guests the opportunity to reflect on the
changing political landscape and for Vincent to read from texts he
created at the time he made the drawings: one day he was on a bench at Dolo=
res Park,
dogs, trolleys and ambulances in the background; another day he was
switching channels from Keith Olberman=E2=80=99s Countdown to NBA basketbal=
l;
and on yet another he was recalling the night sky over Mercy Hot
Springs near Firebaugh,
miles away from the world of politics. Vincent is as likely to seek out
silence as he is music when he works and the ordinary as often as the
unusual. At time these modest drawings bob alongside the rushing
political change in Washington like a tiny buoy marking a small
personal craft; at other times their zen-master repititiousness
underscores perhaps a deeper social and political reality that while
the details in Washington change the soap opera stays the same.

(The) Only Cosmic Music.

http://www.alansondheim.org/tambura1.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/tambura2.mp3

(Please do listen, I am happiest of this of all.)

North Indian tambura digitally descending and ascending.
Perhaps this is the closest one comes to an image-universe.
Artifacts appear and disappear as descent and ascent continues.
For example, audio lissajous towards the end of tambura2.
Of course these are always there.
All music and all sound tends towards this, not towards tambura steady-
state.
Entanglement with observer and apparatus, intrinsic and extrinsic.
What my ears tell me is what is heard.
What my eyes show me is what is seen.
Loop these for perfection.
There are small events among the continuous movement of the fingers.
Mind in the fingers, among them.
For as not to see after and through eye surgery, the hearing.
And trying not to focus and not to focus on trying.
For the Natyasastra says nothing about the drone.
And the drone is present today with sruti box, melodeon, tambura,
electronic software and hardware.
And is always present.
And is always present and in motion and there is motion in the computer,
there is always motion.
There is always motion that collapses and motion that contracts.
Some motion can't get out, some can't get in.
Some motion can't get out, can't get in.
Sometimes there are objects and states as if existing and these are
somewhere in the background.
As if existing for all time, to give existence a meaning.
Or huddled-cuddled around themselves, as if there are objects, objects,
objects.
And now you can hear them, there are no objects at all.
As if there were something to hear.
What is heard is the hearing of it.
What is heard are all the times and spaces of the hearing.
Let us call this beauty, untoward.
Let us call.

Addressing issues! What an idea! Undressing them would

For my talent is to give an impression upon words by
punching, that when the reader casts his eye upon 'em,
he takes up the image from the mould which I have
made.

The most amazing thing about Ashbery is his appeal. I know there are some on this list that view popularity as being a sell out. Ashbery never compromised the integrity of his art. Yet, if you are lucky enough to hear him read, seventeen year olds and octogenarians all join in and recite his work word for word.

His work addresses polital issues by means of immersion

That speaks volumes

Peace
Russ

SOUND SEEKER
David Jhave Johnston (Canada)
http://vispo.com/jhave

Sound Seeker is a "code-synch beat-match jump-edit txt-tool" written in
Actionscript. Jhave says Sound Seeker is "an online real-time
beat-synchronized poem animator. Sound drives the rhythm of the words: their
speed and style of display can be controlled." The homepage shows twelve
experimental video poems produced by Jhave with Sound Seeker. Access the
underlying interactive Flash app in the "Method" section. In the
 "Motivation" section, Jhave discusses remarks by Rudolph Arnheim concerning
intermedia. A fascinating poetry, programming, video, audio, 3D animation,
and theory/poetics project--and the writing is very lively on its own. A
significant project in digital poetry of considerable achievement.

You can see more of what Jhave is doing on his site at http://glia.ca

Hi all,

A quick note to announce some new staffers here at Boog City.

Effective this past issue, Paolo Javier has gone from co- to sole =20
printed matter editor. Paolo recently completed a full-length play, =20
Lunatic, and is working on the original brown boy, a long poetry comic =20=

with artist Ernest Concepcion. He lives in Queens. You can query him =20
to pm@welcometoboogcity.com about writing reviews or sending in =20
publications for possible review.

Joanna Fuhrman is now the poetry editor, effective with the =20
forthcoming Boog City 56. She is the author of three books of poetry =20
published by Hanging Loose Press, most recently Moraine. Her =20
collection Pageant is forthcoming from Alice James Books later this =20
year. She teaches poetry in predictable and unexpected places. You can =20=

email her poetry subs to poetry@welcometoboogcity.com, with no more =20
than five poems, all in one attached file with =93My Name Submission=94 =
in =20
the subject line and as the name of the file, ie: Walt Whitman =20
Submission. Or mail with an SASE to Joanna Fuhrman, Poetry editor, =20
Boog City, 330 W. 28th St., Suite 6H, N.Y., N.Y. 10001-4754.

And with issue 57, Cora Lambert will be taking over as art editor. =20
Cora is an artist, curator, and community activist who received a =20
B.F.A from the School of Visual Arts in 2007. She has worked with the =20=

Leslie/Lohman Gay Arts Foundation, Umbrage Editions, and is currently =20=

curating a quarterly art show called the Think Gallery Affordable Art =20=

Series. Cora lives and works in New York where she continues to build =20=

community through art education. You can query her to =
art@welcometoboogcity.com=20
  about possibly having your art featured in Boog City.

Much thanks to our outgoing staffers, co-printed matter editor Mark =20
Lamoureux, co-poetry editors Julia Cohen and Mathias Svalina, and art =20=

editor Brenda Iijima. Their time, effort, and dedication to Boog City =20=

was much appreciated and will be missed.

as ever,
David

he's clearly a major talent, enormously gifted. But do poets get to retire,=
 or put their talents on auto/pilot? I'm thinking of the work Ashbery has p=
ublished in the last decade.  Yeats wrote some of his best work in his late=
r years. & Bloom, I believe, has placed Ashbery in THAT league, with the li=
kes of Neruda, Rilke and Yeats... =20

Great post!  I second it.

Also, those who think he did nothing beyond TCO, let me ask - how many poets
we know who can follow up a savagely experimental book like TCO with
something as lyrically honeyed as Rivers and Mountains ? Thematic, topical
and formative consistency is a natural expectation for most great poets.
I find none as self-effacing as Ashbery. Yet, there IS a consistency.

Also, as a man of science, let me say this - 20th century science has made
it apparent, especially towards the latter half, that the world we live in
cannot quite be explained is a deterministic fashion anymore. Everything is
governed by laws of statistics/probability. Even laws are themselves, a
function of statistical rules at times. The success of Genome project, for
example, contrary to popular belief, only goes to prove that there IS
indeterminacy, but a deeper knowledge of that could help us take the chances
better. Knowledge-space is a casino we are in, you could just be a better
gambler to get a better understanding. Einstein, who had once remarked, "God
does not play dice with the universe" (btw, there is an ashbery poem that
refers to that statement) reverts it in his later years. Energy is perceived
as discreet, discontinuous packets; the whole gamut of Bose-Einstein
statistics is born etc.

One of the very few poets, in any language, who has successfully gotten
closest to this "real" world (of indeterminacy) is Ashbery. His scholars
have flaunted the word "uncertainty" so often to discuss this aspect of his
poetry (even John seems like the word). I would argue for the word
"possibility" instead.

The most amazing thing about Ashbery is his appeal. I know there are some on
this list that view popularity as being a sell out. Ashbery never

Amy,
Thanks for the heads-up. I'll get a protest out somehow between =20
grading tasks.

GLBT lit has taken it hard recently. A couple of years ago, oh crap, =20
more now, time flies, I was talking to the head editor at Naiad press =20=

in Florida; they used to be the only folks to do a  paperback Lifting =20=

Belly, and she told me they were having to dump Stein and some other =20
stuff because they were having such a hard time moving it--they end =20
result was they were transitioning their list to all lesbian erotica. =20=

I wonder how much of that problem was this sort of ghetto-izing in =20
bookshops? (Won't somebody think of the children! (Except the gay =20
children; leave them behind.))

I'm going to read the articles you provided links for. If one doesn't =20=

tell me what it means to "strip sales rankings," could you let me =20
know? I have a fair idea, but I want to know for sure before I fire =20
off my letter to Amazon and begin spreading the news among my =20
students and immediate friends. JP

If it were a hack, I'd think it would be more likely to put -- choose
your work -- sales rank #1 in certain categories, not to remove sales
rank from lots of books.

Amy, I just tried out searches for you, Ed White, Alan Hollinghurst, "lesbi=
an poetry," "gay porn" and "gay erotica," and I got your Antidotes for an A=
libi, titles by the novelists, and a host of anthologies. I hope this means=
 they've corrected this completely....

Well, it seems it's clearly a hack. Whether or not Amazon has acted in good
faith is another story.

Does anyone remember a few years back when Amazon Canada (I think it was...)
had the problem of authors favorably reviewing their own work/attacking the
work of rivals via the "anonymous poster" settings? It took them weeks to
figure that one out, too.

Don't give them ideas, Catherine. The one wouldn't cancel the other.

why do you suppose this is happening now, under obama, rather than
earlier under bush? is the right taking it to the cyber-streets, as it were?

5IVE SEQUENCES, a visual poem by Nico Vassilakis is being exhibited in AC
[Chapel] as an installation for the first time since its publication.
Enlarged in scale, to 18"x24", from its original chapbook size and offering
a rare opportunity to collectively interact with the piece in a public
forum, 5IVE SEQUENCES explores the inherent structure and transience of
language as a medium.



In creating 5IVE SEQUENCES, Vassilakis focused on the individual shapes and
constructions of letters within words, referring to it as a kind of
"hyper-staring" that allowed him to transform them into images and
sculptural forms, free of the bonds of syntax or semantics.



For Vassilakis, visual poetry is a tangential literature through which the
alphabet is deconstructed into dislocations of meaning and/or the
revisioning of letters-changing the viewers perception and experience of
them. Within his work, letters or fragments of letters and the environment
in which they are placed, become the medium for his compositions. 5IVE
SEQUENCES explores a periodic table of language through individual
letterforms, exposing and disjointing their order to lose their cohesion,
opening up new interpretations and meanings.



Nico Vassilakis is a multimedia artist, poet and writer. He is currently the
curator for the Subtext Reading Series in Seattle. His visual poetry videos
have been shown worldwide at festivals and exhibitions of innovative
language arts. Vassilakis' writings have appeared in numerous magazines,
including: Ribot, Caliban, Aufgabe, Chain, Talisman, Central Park and Golden
Handcuffs Review. His latest publications are TEXT LOSES TIME and most
recently a Vispo essay "staReduction," from BookThug Publishers (Toronto,
Canada).

"Indeterminacy" can mean many things, depending on the context. But the
basic scenario regarding indeterminacy that I think of is this:

Suppose we were able to go back five seconds in time right now. And suppose
that everything, and I mean *everything*, was as it was before, at that
moment, including us, down to the last atom. Could we do anything other than
what we did, when time resumes?

I don't see how it could be possible, personally.

As for Ashbery, he trips the light fantastic where few can go. That's
liberating.

Just received this from a friend. It may be of interest to some of you:
"If Time-Warner, Comcast and other large scale internet have their way the days of unlimited internet are over. You will pay for every byte you upload or download. Here is a link to the story as I heard it initially:
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103041709
If we do not protest this blatant greed things will change for the worse. We will be looking back at the last 10 years as the golden era of the internet before the big money took control. There are already trials in some cities regardless of the protest. I urge each of you to take action now by emailing your politicians and ISPs. If you need a template, or an example, here is one:
'This email is to voice my strong opposition to caps on internet usage. As you probably know some internet providers are currently changing the way they charge for the internet instead of simply requiring a charge for unlimited usage. The internet works quite well as it is currently structured. It is obvious that this is just another attempt by large corporate providers to take advantage of the consumer. I do not use the internet to download movies or any other high bandwidth demand beyond the occasional streaming video of a news story or video at YouTube. Still I believe that the current structure works, that the price is more than sufficient for a provider to make a substantial profit. If some of the changes that are currently in trial become general practice I will abandon the internet and no longer do business on any level with any company that manipulates its customers in order to boost profit. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely,.....' "

Amy, I just tried out searches for you, Ed White, Alan Hollinghurst, "lesbi=

Rivers & Mountains and Tennis Court Oath -- they're early Ashberry, probably the period of his strongest work. After  Wave or maybe Flow Chart, I'm not so sure -- nothing too exciting in the last 10 or 15 years that I'm aware of --
although the collages (some, I hear, were worthy of Joseph Cornell) were interesting.

Jim,

Your post reminds me of an essay I read in the NYT about David Foster
Wallace's undergraduate thesis. I think it may be of interest so I will
quote at length here:

The fatalist contends, quite radically, that human actions and decisions
have no influence on the future. Your behavior today no more shapes events
tomorrow than it shapes events yesterday. Instead, in a seemingly backward
way, the fatalist says it is how things are in the future that uniquely
constrains what happens right now. What might seem like an open possibility
subject to human choice =97 say, whether you fire your handgun =97 is alrea=
dy
either impossible or absolutely necessary. You are merely going with some
cosmic flow.

Perhaps most counterintuitively, the fatalist argues that this topsy-turvy
doctrine can be established by mere reflection on the simple logic of
propositions about the future. If I fire my handgun, one second from now it=
s
barrel will be hot; if I do not fire, one second from now the barrel will
not be hot; but the proposition one second from now the barrel will be
hotis right now either true or false. If the proposition is true, then
it is
the case that I will fire the gun; if it=92s false, then it is the case tha=
t I
won=92t. Either way, it=92s the state of affairs in the future that dictate=
s
what I will or won=92t do now.

[...]
But how to straighten out Taylor=92s fatalism? Wallace proposed that there =
was
a flaw in Taylor=92s argument, a hidden defect. In essence, Taylor was
treating two types of propositions as if they were the same, when in fact
they needed to be distinguished and treated differently. Consider the
sentences =93It was the case that I couldn=92t fire my handgun=94 and =93It=
 cannot
be the case that I did fire my handgun.=94 At first they may sound similar,
but Wallace argued that they involve quite different notions of
impossibility. =93It was the case that I couldn=92t fire my handgun=94 refe=
rs to a
past situation in which discharge is deemed impossible because (let=92s say=
)
my gun was broken. =93It cannot be the case that I did fire my handgun=94 r=
efers
to a present situation in which discharge is deemed impossible because
(let=92s say) my gun is still cool to the touch. The first notion involves =
an
earlier, physical constraint on firing (namely, the broken gun); the other
involves the current absence of a necessary consequence of firing (namely, =
a
hot barrel). An extremely sensitive observer of language, Wallace noted tha=
t
there is a subtle indicator of this important distinction already at work i=
n
our language: the fine differentiation in meaning between =93I couldn=92t h=
ave
done such and so=94 and =93I can=92t have done such and so.=94

This is what Publisher's Lunch had to day this morning:

 Amazon Says Error Affected Over 57,000 Titles, and Has Been Fixed--Or Not
Quite
Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said yesterday the company is fixing the
"glitch" that removed the sales ranking from what they now say was 57,310
books worldwide. Without explaining the error itself (or the provocative
customer service e-mail) any further, Herdener admitted, "This is an
embarrassing and ham-fisted cataloging error for a company that prides
itself on offering complete selection." He says that affected books were in
"broad categories such as Health, Mind & Body, Reproductive & Sexual
Medicine, and Erotica. This problem impacted books not just in the United
States but globally. It affected not just sales rank but also had the effect
of removing books from Amazon's main product search."
PI<http://click.publisherslunchdaily.com/stun/redirect.php?u=NTAwNnwzNDQ4OXxld2VpbnN0ZWluQHJhbmRvbWhvdXNlLmNvbXwyODM4NDZ8ODE5NjAxMDl8NDU1ODU3&id=1406585>

But in giving the same basic statement to the AP--which mistakenly bills it
as an apology--Herdener says they are still working on the problem. "Many
books have now been fixed and we're in the process of fixing the remainder
as quickly as possible, and we intend to implement new measures to make this
kind of accident less likely to occur in the future."

A Seattle PI business reporter blogs about the cause of the error, based on
a conversation with an "Amazon employee who works closely with the systems
involved in the glitch."

The source indicates that "Amazon managers found that an employee who
happened to work in France had filled out a field incorrectly and more than
50,000 items got flipped over to be flagged as 'adult.' (Technically, the
flag for adult content was flipped from 'false' to 'true.')" The source
adds, "It's no big policy change, just some field that's been around forever
filled out incorrectly." Similar versions of this explanation, less formally
sourced, were posted on the internet prior to the PI's blog.

If accurate, it also confirms the suspicion that Amazon does indeed have
some kind of policy to restrict the listing visibility of an unquantified
number of titles considered to contain "adult" content--which would explain
the original customer service e-mail posted on the Internet over the
weekend. Only time will tell whether the company will acknowledge that
policy, how it is implemented, and how many books it covers.Separately,
Amazon has been sending a non-apologetic explanation by e-mail to customers
who had complained (expressing a policy that would stand at odds with any
flagging for "adult" content: "As a retailer, our goal is to provide
customers with the broadest selection possible so they can find, discover,
and buy any item they might be seeking. That selection includes some items
which many people may find objectionable. Therefore, the items offered on
our website represent a wide spectrum of opinions on a variety of topics.

"Amazon.com believes it is censorship not to sell certain titles because we
believe their message is objectionable. Therefore, we'll continue to make
controversial works available in the United States and everywhere else,
except where they're prohibited by law. We also allow readers, authors, and
publishers to express their views freely about these titles and other
products we offer on our website."

If this is directed at me, I'm assuming that this is an entirely =20
opportunistic exploitation of a breech in Amazon's "security." The =20
timing is related to the publication of the potential of this exploit =20=

on a number of blogs. Given the puerile and misogynistic nature of =20
nerd culture, it's no surprise to me that GLBT material was the =20
target of the exploit. Myself, I'm inclined to regard it as a symptom =20=

of an overall attitude more than as an effort directed by Amazon or a =20=

right-wing group. Call it asymmetrical idiocy.

My assumptions are no more than that, and they're based on what I =20
read on Ars Technica this morning. There's probably more info by now.

Frankly, I find my scenario to be more disturbing: a continual =20
festering hate is, to me, worse than a few bloviating toads and their =20=

flocks--people who can be judged non-norm. But when the norm is "ha =20
ha that's gay," well, it's a death of a thousand little cutting =20
humiliations.

I agree with Amy that Amazon's responses are half-assed and =20
disingenuous. I doubt there was will, malevolent or benevolent. Just =20
a corporate beast slouching toward the bottom line and the lowest =20
common denominator (who, I am sure, share the same basement room of a =20=

suburban McMansion).

Thank you Aryanil for a brilliant letter!

I like the way you suggest the word "possibility" rather than
"indeterminancy"--

I wondered also why the example from Rod Smith is supposed to be evidence o=
f
a
 " more worldy sensibility, and address(es)  something social," when it is =
a
description of an episode of a  TV show which is in rerun for over thirty
years as being  taken by one of the persons in the story to be an image of
"America now."

Not having read the book from which this is taken, I don't know if the
author is writing a parody, or proposing a description of an event among
"real" or "fictional" or "stereotypical" persons--as "illustrative" of his
idea of a certain American "voice" or "persona"--and "what they might say
and think"--or is "in actuality based on a real event in the author's life"
etc--
(Or as they say on the Tru Channel:  "Not reality. Actuality.")

It is a description of a "social occaision" in which a "character" reads a
TV rerun as showing the problems of "America now," but how it is "more
worldly" and "addressing something social" in ways Ashbery's current
writings aren't and do not, one can't really say on the strength of the
evidence given.

(This itself  may be said to be a form of "Indeterminancy" may it not, in
its own humble way--"the not being able to say due to the lack of sufficien=
t
evidence either way"--as a recognition of an Indeterminancy--in that "the
matter at hand is Indeterminate at present"--)

Actually the idea that past/future actions are not changeable in the presen=
t
is one daily disproven by some very simple methods.  Also the
"inevitability" of the progression of the Past to the Present in terms of a
Future is also not very hard to demontsrate and create. In many ways in man=
y
media, this is going on al around one every day--

One does not have to travel into the past of five seconds ago at all--when
one has so much more already at one's command right now--write now!


For example:  there are a number of Israeli State and Pro-Israeli groups
whose functions are to continually alter or have deleted any posts, you
tube, Google, Face Book, etc which are deemed "critical of Israel."

As a Government Minister said, this is a form of Assault analogous to that
carried out recently on Gaza.

By these means, it is not just references which refer to the present which
are "disappeared," but also those which in any way refer to such past
incidents as are deemed "detrimental to the image of the State of Israel."

The removal or alteration of events, names, ideas makes possible the
continual reinvention, revision not only of the Past, but also of the Futur=
e
as it approaches as "new information" to be eradicated and substituted by
information which conforms to the trajectory of a History which proves
itself to be as it were Fore Ordained.

This is a method long long  in use in the world' s  newspapers, scrolls,
monuments, school texts, history books, and histories of Culture.  The
difference is simply that the arenas of information/disinformation and
censorship have been greatly extended throughout ever more media of
communication and "keeping of records."   The idea of using these as a form
of "Assault" is also very ancient--as is the idea of stating publicly that
one is going to undertake these tactics.  For this plants doubt ahead of
time in all forms of information as to whether or not they have been altere=
d
yet or not.  That doubt is as debilitating as a direct assault in
psychological and stress terms.


This is a method which in the Present is making the Future"happen now" so
that when it does actually happen--it will not be noticed as a "drastic
change" but simply as something already long done, a fait accompli.  Or, as
something long predicted, and thus "not at all surprising" and revelatory
once again of the "correctness of the State's thinking."  The "Future" has
actually "all along existed as the Past," in these terms, so that the sense
of a series of events "having happened" is removed and one finds instead
those smooth surfaces of Deleuze and Guattari in which the War and State
Machines glide along without any resistance or friction whatsoever. "As it
It is Now, as it Was and as it Ever Shall be."

It is not just the deleting or altering of texts and images which is
undertaken, but also that of  altering maps on line so that the Palestinian
names of refugee camps, villages, hills--are all renamed in Hebrew, giving
the impression that these sites are already part of Israel, so that when
they are indeed "owned"  in actuality via force, no one wil notice this
"drastic change,"  and, if any protests are launched, al one has to do is
point to the maps on line, in order to say, these Hebrew-named villages
have  been there all along.

One aspect of the Indeterminacy Principle is that the observer affects what
is observed.

By altering ahead of time what it is that the Observer will observe, one ha=
s
the ability to indeed "change the action in the present" of that  "in the
future" by way of the altering of the Past to conform to both Future and
Present.  that is, that "ahead of time" the pointsof reference which will b=
e
used in the making of an Observation will have been altered so that what is
now a possible Observation has already been earidicated and substituted by
one which "has never happened except in terms of language, by rebarding,
etc."


That is, a Past which never was, can be used to alter the possiblities of a
Future via a reordering  in the Present of  the range of probabilities, of
statistical "outcomes."

Language itself is altering time, distorting it, contaminating it and
permeating it with  particles of corrosive effect, or of the kind that are
"rotten before ripe."


If one cannot completely control the Observer's observations, at least one
has introduced differences into them by way of disinformation which will
take them on a "detour" from the actuality of the present "on the ground."

This detouring--or "detourning"--"shifts the balance of power, the
probabilities of outcomes"--

The term "rebranding" has gained widespread use in recent years for
everything from the naming of products to the naming of policies.  The
latter, after all,  from the point of view of Business journals such as the
one which declared President Obama  their Man of the (Business, Marketing)
Year are one and the same.  The rebranding by the Obama administration of
practically every term from the Bush days to do with the War on Terror (now
known as Overseas Contingency Operations; Terrorist Acts, Bombings etc-- ar=
e
now called Man Made Disasters--) leads people to think that there is indeed
"Change" when in fact the same old--and sometimes far worse--policies are i=
n
use as under Bush.

The Present is "Changed" in name only from the Past--leading the citizens t=
o
think that their Future is "going to be different" than what it would have
been previously.  "The names may change, but the game remains the same," as
the saying goes.

The difference between "can not" and "could not" no longer matters, because
the Past is altered in the Present to conform with that version of the
Future which is not "going to happen," but "already has happened " and
awaits only to fulfill its destiny "on the ground."

This is the approach utilized by Big Brother in Orwell's 1984, and also one
suggested by the terminologies of Imperialism and Colonialism, which posit
such "Inevitabilities" linking Past Present and Future in an indissoluable
Union as "Manifest Destiny."

Because the act of observation plays a part in the event being observed,
what is important in terms of language is to "rebrand" perceptions of the
observations  of how the event was perceived to have been happening at the
same time that it was happening. I.E. the" Present" is always just a bit in
arrears of the "real time present," and existing already as an "after the
fact" Past of what is just to come as its own "Future"--that arrival "after
the fact" of a Present which has turned into a Futurity--its own Futurity.

("Deja vu all over again"--"it is new to me, yet not unknown" (the
Uncanny)--

A chilling example of these varieties,  possibilities, probabilities of
modus operandi is found in a sign often hanging in the offices of the State
Bureaucracies in charge of the "Health and Human Services" and various
others related to Probation and Parole.

This sign simply states:

"If it is not in writing, it never happened."

Thus, "As it is Written, So Shall it Be"-(and "So it Was" and "So it is
Now")---is at the heart of the Control via language that a writer/sound and
film experimenter like Burroughs, for example, seeks to "Cut Up"--to create
"Break through in the Grey Room where the reality Films" are edited.

Schrodinger's cat remains the best scientific hypothesis concerning indeter=
minacy. But I also like Foucalt's matter of fact approach, especially as it=
 concerns sanity or "human nature." Sanity, according to Foucalt, is simply=
 a matter of  power, or who is in control. The insane are locked up by the =
sane.

As for Ashbery, I always think of Picasso when I try to quantify who is or =
isn't a major artist (which maybe ill advised, still...). & Picasso had a v=
ery strong ealy period/middle period/and closed well. My only problem with =
Ashbery is Late Ashbery.   =20

Fanny Howe and Ange Mlinko Receive Major Literary Awards
from Poetry Foundation
Howe to receive $100,000 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize

CHICAGO =AD The Poetry Foundation, publisher of=20
Poetry magazine, is pleased to announce that=20
poets Fanny Howe and Ange Mlinko are the winners=20
of its sixth annual Pegasus Awards.

Howe is the recipient of the 2009 Ruth Lilly=20
Poetry Prize. Established in 1986 and presented=20
annually by the Poetry Foundation to a living=20
U.S. poet whose lifetime accomplishments warrant=20
extraordinary recognition, the Ruth Lilly Prize=20
is one of the most prestigious awards given to=20
American poets, and at $100,000 it is one of the=20
nation=92s largest literary prizes. Poet and critic=20
Ange Mlinko is the winner of the Randall Jarrell=20
Award in Poetry Criticism. The prizes will be=20
presented at the Pegasus Awards ceremony at the=20
Arts Club of Chicago on Tuesday, May 19.

In announcing the Lilly Prize, Christian Wiman,=20
editor of Poetry magazine, said: =93Fanny Howe is a=20
religious writer whose work makes you more alert=20
and alive to the earth, an experimental writer=20
who can break your heart. Live in her world for a=20
while, and it can change the way you think of yours.=94

=93The selection of Fanny Howe as this year=92s=20
winner of the Lilly Prize does honor to the=20
traditions=ADof excellence, importance, and=20
discovery=ADthat the prize has stood for since it=20
was established over 20 years ago,=94 said John=20
Barr, president of the Poetry Foundation.

The Poetry Foundation issued the following=20
statement in making the award: =93Reading Fanny=20
Howe=ADboth the poetry and the prose=ADone has the=20
sense of a life that has been inhabited so=20
intensely and lovingly that even her smallest=20
fragments seem steeped in that experience. Her=20
poetry can be elusive and hermetic, and then=20
abruptly and devastatingly candid; it is marked=20
by the pressures of history and culture, yet=20
defiantly, transcendently lyrical. She is a=20
demanding and deeply rewarding artist, and her=20
body of work seems larger, stranger, and more=20
permanent with each new book she publishes.=94

Fanny Howe, 68, has written many books of poetry,=20
including Gone (University of California Press,=20
2003), Selected Poems (UC Press, 2000), On the=20
Ground (Graywolf Press, 2004), and The Lyrics=20
(Graywolf, 2007). She has also written novels,=20
five of which have been collected in one volume=20
called Radical Love. At age 17 Howe left her home=20
in Boston for California and has since spent her=20
life there and in England, Ireland, and=20
Massachusetts. In recent years she has won the=20
Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize, a fellowship from=20
the Guggenheim Foundation, and an award from the=20
American Academy of Arts and Letters. She has=20
written two collections of essays, The Wedding=20
Dress (UC Press, 2003) and The Winter Sun=20
(Graywolf, 2009). Howe has three grown children=20
and six little grandchildren; she currently lives on Martha=92s Vineyard.

Ange Mlinko is the third recipient of the Randall=20
Jarrell Award in Poetry Criticism. The $10,000=20
prize is awarded for poetry criticism that is=20
intelligent and learned as well as lively and=20
enjoyable to read. Mlinko, 39, is the author of=20
two books, Matinees (Zoland Books, 1999) and=20
Starred Wire (Coffee House Press, 2005), which=20
was a National Poetry Series winner in 2004 and a=20
finalist for the James Laughlin Award the following year.

The Poetry Foundation issued the following=20
statement in announcing Mlinko=92s award: =93From=20
Sappho to the Language poets, from Nicolas of=20
Cusa to The Brady Bunch, Ange Mlinko=92s criticism=20
is brilliantly wide-ranging; it is eclectic and=20
astringent yet always lucid and generous. We are=20
pleased to recognize a young critic whose=20
distinctive sharp wit and formidable power have=20
helped revitalize the art of writing about poetry.=94

Mlinko was born in Philadelphia and currently=20
lives in the lower Hudson Valley, where she=20
raises her two sons. She has an undergraduate=20
degree in philosophy and mathematics from St.=20
John=92s College and an MFA from the Creative=20
Writing Program at Brown University. Her poetry=20
and criticism have appeared or are forthcoming in=20
Poetry and the Poetry Foundation website, the=20
London Review of Books, The New Yorker,=20
Bookforum, and The Nation, where she also writes=20
an occasional column on language called Lingo.

About the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize
American poetry has no greater friend than Ruth=20
Lilly. Over many years and in many ways, it has=20
been blessed by her personal generosity. In 1985=20
she endowed the Ruth Lilly Professorship in=20
Poetry at Indiana University. In 1989 she created=20
Ruth Lilly Poetry Fellowships, for $15,000 each,=20
given annually by the Poetry Foundation to=20
undergraduate or graduate students selected=20
through a national competition. In 2002 her=20
lifetime engagement with poetry culminated in a=20
magnificent bequest that will enable the Poetry=20
Foundation to promote, in perpetuity, a vigorous=20
presence for poetry in our culture.

The Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize honors a living U.S.=20
poet whose lifetime accomplishments warrant=20
extraordinary recognition. Established in 1986 by=20
Ruth Lilly, the annual prize is sponsored and=20
administered by the Poetry Foundation, publisher=20
of Poetry magazine. Over the last 20 years, the=20
Lilly Prize has awarded more than $1,000,000. The=20
previous recipients are Adrienne Rich, Philip=20
Levine, Anthony Hecht, Mona Van Duyn, Hayden=20

About the Pegasus Awards
The Poetry Foundation has established a family of=20
prizes with an emphasis on new awards to=20
under-recognized poets and types of poetry.=20
Inaugurated in 2004, the Pegasus Awards are=20
announced annually in the spring. The Poetry=20
Foundation believes that targeted prizes can help=20
redress underappreciated accomplishments,=20
diversify the kinds of poetry being written, and=20
widen the audience for the art form. With this in=20
mind, it may create additional prizes in the years ahead.

patrick,

we could have arrived where we are by various paths. the future does not
determine the past. some types of things/events/conditions are such that we
can infer things/events/conditions that must have preceded them. but many
can have had multiple precedents. causality is not bijective. it is like a
function, though, in that each moment is mapped to but one future moment. or
so it seems to me. we can imagine various things that we could do next. i
could type a j. or i could type a ?. but not both.

what is choice, then? certainly we do make our choices.

yet in that scenario i outlined in my last e, i said i don't see how it's
possible that if we went back in time five seconds, and *everything* was
exactly the same as it was, that i could do anything other than i did. if
that is true, then what is choice?

thanks for that.

This looks amazing!  I wish I had the time to organize a version of it here
in Minneapolis to coincide.  This is the kind of thing that would be great
to do in several cities simultaneously.

I'm sending it around to as many people as I can, including some friends in
Chicago.

I think, when it's a discussion of - this major poet is doing something,
maybe it should broaden to include other things (in this case "ethical"
things), we are making an assumption, however unwittingly, that he is a
major poet and thus he could perhaps be capable of a political poetry which
is effectively political.  We wouldn't be complaining that he isn't
political enough unless we had already assumed that he possesses some kind
of tool (his "gift") which has more inherent political applicability than
other tools.  I think that, in doing this, we are idealizing.  To us, he is
'beyond,' extra-capable compared to our capability, so some of us criticize
him, in this case, for not embodying more of what we hold to be beyond
ourselves such as a kind of effective ethical praxis, whereas to himself he
is only himself and I think it might be dangerous to assume otherwise.
 Maybe a better question is how can we participate in a unilateral
collaborative action which mounts a politically effective intervention  with
"poetry."  And I think we should be thankful that we are lucky enough to
live in the time of a "major poet" - perhaps more than one.  For me,
Ashbery's poetry is a particular and salient definition of intelligence, and
I think a negative critique is only productive if it takes the form of, What
is an alternative to this? not, What should this have been instead of
itself?  Someone who doesn't like his last five books is free to find a
better resource, but what is the use of dwelling on a dissatisfaction?  In
this regard, a positive critique, I think, would go more like: How can we
apply what is unique here to an absolutely criterion-referenced poetics?

Subject:      The death of Franklin Rosemont
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

_______________

Franklin Rosemont, surrealist poet, artist, historian, street speaker,
& labor activist, died of an aneurysm on Sunday, April 12th in
Chicago, Illinois.  He was 65 years old.  With his partner & comrade,
Penelope Rosemont, & lifelong friend Paul Garon, he co-founded the
Chicago Surrealist Group, a remarkable presence in the art & activism
landscape of Chicago for forty years.

Rosemont did not separate scholarship from art, or art from political
& social revolt. His books of poetry include "The morning of a machine
gun" (Chicago : Surrealist Editions, 1968); "The apple of the
automatic zebra's eye" (Cambridge, Massachusetts : Radical America,
1971); "Lamps hurled at the stunning algebra of ants" (Chicago :
Surrealist Editions & Black Swan Press, 1990); & "Penelope" (Chicago :
Surrealist Editions, 1997).

Rosemont was a leading figure in the reorganization of America=92s
oldest labor press, the Charles H. Kerr Company.  Under the mantle of
the Kerr Company, Franklin edited & printed the work of some of the
most interesting & important figures in the development of the
political left:  C.L.R. James, Martin Glaberman, Staughton Lynd, David
Dellinger, Cornelius Castoriadis, Sam Dolgoff, Paul Goodman, Grace Lee
Boggs, Paul Avrich, Augustin Souchy, Mother Jones, Lucy Parsons,
Benjamin P=E9ret, Utah Phillips, Paul Buhle, T-Bone Slim, George
Woodcock, and, in a new book released just days before Franklin=92s
death, Carl Sandburg.  In later years, Franklin Rosemont created &
edited the Surrealist Histories series at the University of Texas
Press, in addition to continuing his work with the Kerr Company &
Black Swan Press.

Franklin Rosemont was a friend & valued colleague of such persons as
Studs Terkel, Mary Low, the poets Philip Lamantia, Diane di Prima,
Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Dennis Brutus, the painter Leonora Carrington,
& the historians David Roediger, John Bracey, & Robin D.G. Kelley.

I first encountered Franklin Rosemont face-to-face during the Chicago
protests of August 1968.  Then & since, I found him to be an amazing
blend of contradictions, at once cordial yet cantankerous, amiable yet
dismissive, spontaneous & enthusiastic yet grim, social yet
unmistakably self-absorbed, creative yet singularly overpowering.
Indeed, he was a unique personality.

My condolences & solidarity to Penelope Rosemont, the Chicago group &
its affiliates.

Yes. But as soon as the time factor comes in (like you say - if we went back
in time five seconds...) that element of "indeterminacy" invites itself. The
whole idea of going back in time to relocate oneself proposes a fallacy. And
to extend it and corollarize - memory doesn't or cannot exactly retrace.

Schrodinger's cat, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, George Gamow's
"railway uncle" (he has this wonderful story about going to a railway
station to meet his highschool buddy's dad - Gamow is in his mid-forties but
his buddy's dad, as he gets off the train to meet him, appears much younger
than either of them, in his 30s perhaps....Gamow's friend explains, "my dad
is a salesman and he has travelled all his life, virtually everyday...in
these ("c" speed) trains - i.e trains that run at speeds higher than the
speed of light. So the dad didn't age for all those hours he spent in the
trains...) are all great examples of what I meant by "indeterminacy".

A very recent Asian film by Wong Kar-Wai - "2046" - brilliantly serves as
the perfectly obtuse example of how memory and this element of
"indeterminacy" could be treated by a creative artist.

Ashbery does all that with such plebeianist grace that most often we don't
notice it at all. The "weather-talk" for example. I can't recall another
poet who talks so incessantly about weather. "The weather, for
example"......the most obvious "unpredictable", but we didn't see it until
he said so.

Our most original ideas are the simplest ones.

Then lines like these -

<i>How many snakes and lizards shed their skins
For time to be passing on like this,
Sinking deeper in the sand as it wound toward
The conclusion. ....</i>

(Vetiver/April Galleons, 1987)

Also, if you look at his work from the perspective of the non-English
language world, he continues to be one of the most miraculous poets of both
the present and the past. Even on the other side of the planet, and in
translation. Not much of contemporary English language poetry can claim that
- evoke surprisal and lyrical shiver at the same time. In another language,
in another land.

patrick,

we could have arrived where we are by various paths. the future does not
determine the past. some types of things/events/conditions are such that we
can infer things/events/conditions that must have preceded them. but many
can have had multiple precedents. causality is not bijective. it is like a
function, though, in that each moment is mapped to but one future moment. or

so it seems to me. we can imagine various things that we could do next. i
could type a j. or i could type a ?. but not both.

what is choice, then? certainly we do make our choices.

yet in that scenario i outlined in my last e, i said i don't see how it's
possible that if we went back in time five seconds, and *everything* was
exactly the same as it was, that i could do anything other than i did. if
that is true, then what is choice?

thanks for that.

Jim,

Unless I'm misreading something in your email or in the article I cited
itself, I do think it speaks directly to your scenario, specifically where
you ask COULD I do anything other than I did?

I think, quite simply, yes you could have made done something different. You
just didn't. So perhaps that goes some way to defining choice.

It's that keyword "could" that is so important and, accordingly, gets
adequate treatment in the article.

Here's the Ashbery poem I referred to. It is a personal favorite and I have
read it several times lately while trying to translate it to Bangla. I hope
the listserv admin would let us read it for once in the context of the
recent ashbery-thread. For me, this is an example of a poem, which does the
many things critics and literary pundits talk about now and then, but at the
same time, it explains itself like "weather" - something everyone
understands her or his own way everywhere in the world.

Vetiver

John Ashbery

Ages passed slowly, like a load of hay,
As the flowers recited their lines
And pike stirred at the bottom of the pond.
The pen was cool to the touch.
The staircase swept upward
Through fragmented garlands, keeping the melancholy
Already distilled in letters of the alphabet.

It would be time for winter now, its spun-sugar
Palaces and also lines of care
At the mouth, pink smudges on the forehead and cheeks,
The color once known as "ashes of roses."
How many snakes and lizards shed their skins
For time to be passing on like this,
Sinking deeper in the sand as it wound toward
The conclusion. It had all been working so well and now,
Well, it just kind of came apart in the hand
As a change is voiced, sharp
As a fishhook in the throat, and decorative tears flowed
Past us into a basin called infinity.

There was no charge for anything, the gates
Had been left open intentionally.
Don't follow, you can have whatever it is.
And in some room someone examines his youth,
Finds it dry and hollow, porous to the touch.
O keep me with you, unless the outdoors
Embraces both of us, unites us, unless
The birdcatchers put away their twigs,
The fishermen haul in their sleek empty nets
And others become part of the immense crowd
Around this bonfire, a situation
That has come to mean us to us, and the crying
In the leaves is saved, the last silver drops.

Thanks for the link -- I'm so glad Fanny Howe is getting this
mainstream recognition; I appreciate the way she combines experimental
form/language with a willingness to engage with the content of daily
life, esp. in the realm of mothering.

Steve's original question (message) was brave in many ways.=A0 In a time
when some poets feel poetry isn't strong enough to STAND without the
buttresses of philosophy and theory, it's refreshing to hear someone
ask WHERE IS YOUR WORLDVIEW AT THESE DAYS?

Take YOUR to mean your own.

Freud said it best:
Everywhere I go I find that a poet has been there before me.

He said poet.=A0 Poet.=A0 I'm with Freud, at least on this.

This really looks amazing, what a great idea.  And I hope someone will
film it, put it up on the web.

It makes me think about my friend who called me this evening EXCITED
about some American Idol contestant making it to the next stage of
American Idol.  Bread & Circus galore.

It makes me think too that we know THE EXACT number of American dead.
We know their names, their places of birth, their rank and serial
numbers.

When it comes to the citizens of Iraq however, the state department's
numbers and information about THEIR DEAD (OUR dead too, as THEIR dead
is on our blood-splattered hands forever!) the numbers range on and
off by hundreds of thousands.  The estimates from outside sources say
over a million.  Over a million, and counting, by the day.

Obama promises to redistribute troops from one war to the other war.
Obama promises a new meat grinder with a different terrain.  Do they
get American Idol in Afghanistan?  Maybe one day?  I'm not being glib,
I really DO wonder.

The horror of the senses we create, and I'm talking about our war(s),
not our television show.

i don't think you're grappling with the problem. it's odd how empty the word
"choice" can be, at times.

if we go back 5 seconds and *everything* is exactly the same as it was 5
seconds ago, including us, down to the last atom, then any *thoughtful*
decision we take will be the same, insofar as it is the result of
deliberation, which is the same as it was 5 seconds ago. the only decision
that might be different is a random decision but, even then, whatever the
mechanism that determines the state of the selection will be the same. all
mechanistically determined processes will have exactly the same result as
they did previously.

i saw an interview last night with leonard cohen. he said "you can read the
book of your life but you can't change a word."

on Anselm Berrigan=92s To Hell With Sleep:
=20
Anselm Berrigan gives us a fresh dose of his discordant mind music. To Hell=
 With Sleep was written by the poet in the first months after the birth of =
his daughter=2C mostly during brief periods of time when he was half-awake =
or less so=2C letting the poetry be unthought within its vehicle of eight s=
even-line slanting stanzas per session=2C of which there were nine. The imp=
ulse driving the writing was to let sounds-turning-toward-words follow from=
 the intensified state of consciousness the arrival of this baby initiated.=
 No prescience=2C reflection=2C computer tricks=2C formal appropriation=2C =
or plotting of any kind was used in the in the writing of this work. Joy=2C=
 fear=2C humor=2C sound=2C bafflement and recognition-in-exchange-for-recog=
nition were the instruments
=20
*****

on Sara Veglahn=92s Another Random Heart:
=20
This prose-poem sequence opens with the following sentence: "Scenes left on=
 the cutting room floor flower into their own scenery." Such an auspiciousl=
y suggestive start functions as a distillation of the book=92s prismatic ec=
ho chamber=2C where painterly lyricism and narrative probing converge withi=
n each musically astute sentence. This is a symphony of partial happenings=
=2C ghostly movements=2C and investigatory ruminations=2C a stroll through =
an exhibit of paintings that seem to stare back at the viewer: captivating=

I’d like to begin this announcement by thanking Jeffrey Spahr-Summers,
who is leaving us as Art Director. He did a great job for a solid year,
but now wishes to spend more time on his own literary projects. We’ll
miss him, and we’re actively seeking a new Art Director to choose the
visual art and film at Unlikely 2.0. Anyone applying for the position
should understand that they’ll be responsible for choosing the art and
film in the Unlikely print edition, as well.

Oh, yeah. There’s going to be an Unlikely print edition.

The team at www.UnlikelyStories.org <http://www.UnlikelyStories.org/> is
now partnering with the overlapping team at www.MakeItNewMedia.com to
begin a proper print publishing arm: Unlikely Books. Next year, we’ll be
releasing three full-length volumes.

We’re going to focus on two authors, bound together in one volume. We
don’t know about you, but we’re getting a little sick of the decreasing
length of poetry books combined with the increasing price of trade
paperbacks. On the other hand, there are some great poets who can put
out 80 excellent pages on a few related themes, but 150 pages of poetry
by the same author usually involves covering diverse themes that might
not go well together. So in the tradition of Henry Rollins’ 2.13.61
Publications, we’re binding two authors together in a single flipbook,
styled so that each author gets a “front cover.” The reader gets their
money’s worth, and the writer and editor get to work with manageable
manuscripts.

So we’re very pleased to announce the 2010 publication of /"First
Reverse"/ by markk bound with "/Monolith"/ by Anne McMillen (biography
notes below). And in keeping with our philosophy that poetry, art,
culture, and politics are just one big gooey phenomenon of readability,
we’ll be publishing a volume of nonfiction cultural critique: Tom
Bradley will bring us "/My Hands Were Clean/," paired with "/Dr. Gonzo"/
by Deb Hoag (even more biography notes below). These authors were
selected for both compatibility and friction: we believe that if you
enjoy one side of an Unlikely Book, you’ll enjoy the other, despite the
fact that we’re presenting four very different authors and perspectives.

And the Unlikely print edition. Stupid, contagious, and sure to be
imitated, its pages will feature cultural commentary, fiction and
creative non-fiction, poetry, interviews, and tons of
carefully-reproduced full-color visual art. Make It New Media is a new
kind of print fulfillment company, focused on the arts and a personal
involvement with each book, and our partnership with them will allow us
to enclose both a mix CD and DVD of short films in the Unlikely
anthology. The “print edition” will have all the multimedia aspects of
the current Unlikely 2.0 web site, and will be a mixture of new material
and some classic reprints from eleven years of UnlikelyStories.org.
Submissions of essays, reviews, interviews, fiction and creative
nonfiction, poetry, visual art, film, spoken word and music will open
soon, but we need an Art Director first. So apply.

Did we mention the poetry chapbooks? Make It New Media has already
produced one for us: "/Blue Rooms, Black Holes, White Lights/," a
fine-art production by Belinda Subraman featuring visual art by César
Ivan. Later in 2009, we’ll be putting out a chapbook by Anne Lombardo
Ardolino featuring cover art by Clayton Patterson. And in 2010, we’ll
have poetry chapbooks by Lawrence Welsh and Donna Snyder.

We couldn’t possibly do this without an enormous book release party.
That would be wrong and bad. We’re still working out the time and place,
but some unfortunate town in the American Southwest will be selected for
live reads, author signings, and other antisocial behavioral patterns
sometime next year.

Although we will seek unsolicited submissions for the Unlikely
anthology, we unfortunately can’t normally accept full-length
manuscripts. Our e-zine, UnlikelyStories.org, has a wide-open
submissions policy, and having such a policy for Unlikely Books would
surely kill us. However, we /will/ be running an annual poetry chapbook
contest! We’ll be announcing the 2009 contest in a couple of weeks, and
have lots of unusual benefits planned, so watch this space (especially
if it’s your inbox).

I feel so much Love I want to cut things open,

To add this to the several Franklin Rosemont recollections:

In 1968 or 1969, the independent mag, Radical America, published an
issue devoted to surrealism. Rosemont=92s aesthetic and fingerprints
were all over it [I don=92t know where or how Penelope and Franklin
split their efforts, so perhaps it was a duo=92s imprint I=92m
recapturing]. For those too young to have lived or participated in the
1960=92s independent litmag culture, it was a killer print moment when
cultural, literary & social manifestations fluidly blended in the
era=92s counterculture publications.

Though the word =93morph=94 didn=92t exist, Radical America =93morphed=94 o=
r
spun off into Cultural Correspondence, the final issues of which were
structurally magnificent & extraordinary in their useful anarchy and
grasp of the interconnectiveness of irrational arts practice. CC
#10-11 =93Surrealism & its Popular Accomplices=94 had gorgeous &
substantial illustrated articles on subjects from the 3 Stooges, Henry
Darger, Poetry & Freedom, dance & instinct, and Les Blanc to dance
magic and utopian dreams. Franklin Rosemont contributed pieces on H.P.
Lovecraft, =93T-Bone Slim & the Phonetic Cabala,=94 =93Mel Blanc =97 the
Wizard of Audio,=94 Buster Keaton, Bugs Bunny. He reviewed texts on
French and Portuguese surrealist poets and other subjects linking
politics, film, music and global poetries. The subsequent 1981 issue
of CC [=93Giant last issue! Collectors=92 item!=94] had FR=92s art and
polemics, including the wonderful [wonder-full] =93Report on Objective
Conditions,=94 which said much of what I sense continues to be the
manifesto of many participants on Spidertangle =93...Life is not ours to
be eked out =97 it is a question of inspiration or death.=94

FR pushed for constant renewal, ceaseless surreal =93moral vigilance,=94
and =93global scope.=94 Bracketing his report=92s text is an opening and
closing Time & Temperature indication, lest one stray from the vital
ground realities [8Pm, 31 degrees, wind, barometric pressure], the
street and the raw blow off Lake Michigan.

At first, I thought you were suggesting that our will in the past would be
constrained by the physical reality of the present. That if door number 1
were open now, we couldn't do anything else except choose door number 1 five
seconds ago. Hence my sending the article, which directly addresses this
question.

If I understand you correctly then I agree with you. It seems pretty
straight forward, but the element of time travel is more distracting for me
than helpful. I don't see a difference between a decision made in the
present and one made in the past without any knowledge or influence of the
future.

But I could probably do a better job of educating myself in philosophy.

17 REASONS WHY: A VISUAL ARCHEOLOGY

April 24-May 30, 2009. Opening Reception Friday April 24, 6-9 pm.

David Buuck and BARGE present =E2=80=9C17 Reasons Why=E2=80=9D, a site-spec=
ific installation and research office that will present a visual archeology=
 of the Mission and 17th Street environment, as part of an ongoing multi-me=
dia investigation into how we see, know, and understand our everyday urban =
spaces. As part of Mission 17=E2=80=99s Visual/Cultural Criticism Residency=
, BARGE brings its toolkit of aesthetic and critical practices to tackle th=
e thorny task of representing a diverse site, with all its historical and c=
ultural complexities.

With this exhibition and its related public programming, BARGE aims to crea=
te a space for reflection on the complex intersections of place and memory,=
 change and nostalgia, history and its representations. A critical poetics =
of visual and cultural criticism will emerge, as maps, photography, writing=
, found materials & performance provide the basis for a =E2=80=99sampling=
=E2=80=99 of the site and its environs, with the installation space functio=
ning as a kind of laboratory for materialist (re)mixing. BARGE will install=
 a =E2=80=98research office=E2=80=99 in the gallery space, where BARGE will=
 be conducting investigatory projects throughout the run of the exhibition,=
 inviting participation in the gallery and online, and expanding the instal=
lation and catalog as the residency unfolds. Rather than merely presenting =
=E2=80=98finished work=E2=80=99 that sits idly in the gallery, The BARGE re=
search office will be an ongoing performative space, foregrounding the cont=
ingent, everyday forces and transitions in the Mission, while also making v=
isible the methodologies of visual criticism and interpretation at work=E2=
=80=94and at play.

poem. Multiple interwoven narratives explore life within zones of conflict
as viewed through the lens of current warfare. The narratives range from
passages inspired by journal entries, firsthand accounts, and news reports
to poetic constructs collaged from military doctrine, Freedom of Information
Act released government documents (like CIA interrogation manuals, and
detainee autopsy reports), and numerous other sources.

The film collages and juxtaposes archival source material with U.S. Military
footage in an exploration of alternative narrative interpretations of the
source text.


The film screening is part of "The Marriage of Poetry" featuring readings by
Danielle Chapman & Dan-Beachy Quick, with live musical performances by Pont
des Arts Ensemble & The Jim Barbick Trio. The main event starts at 6 p.m.

The Asian American Writers' Workshop presents

*From Jos=E9 Rizal to Jos=E9 Garcia Villa:
An Introduction to Philippine Literary Greats
*

*Celebrate two heroes of Philippine literature and
the Philippine-American heritage and experience

JOS=C9 RIZAL and JOS=C9 GARCIA VILLA

with special guests

HAROLD AUGENBRAUM and LUIS H. FRANCIA
*

Readings & Discussion
Light Reception

*Monday, April 27 @ 7pm
The Workshop*
16 W. 32nd Street, 10th Floor
(between Broadway & Fifth Ave)

*TICKET PRICING*
General Admission: $25
AAWW and AAJA Members: $20
Students: $15
VIP Package: $50 (includes books and AAWW membership)


*Jos=E9 Rizal* (1861-1896) penned the great Philippine novel, *Noli Me Tang=
ere
*. Set during the Spanish occupation,* Noli* is a love story of a young
gentleman who returns to the Philippines from Europe after his father's
death. This powerful, moving novel and its sequel, *El Filibusterismo*, wer=
e
banned by Spanish authorities. Rizal was later executed for sedition,
rebellion, and conspiracy. Now considered a Philippine national hero, his
work helped spark revolutionary movements.

Well-known translator and critic *Harold Augenbraum* discusses Rizal's life
and reads from his translation of *Noli Me Tangere*, published by Penguin
Classics, and from his translation-in-progress of* El Filibusterismo*.
Augenbraum currently serves as Executive Director of the National Book
Foundation.

***

Known as the "Pope of Greenwich Village,"* Jos=E9 Garcia Villa* (1908-1997)
was arguably the most important Asian American writer of the mid-twentieth
century, as well as a colleague of modern literary giants such as W.H. Aude=
n
and Tennessee Williams. Edith Sitwell called him "a poet with a great, even
an astounding, and perfectly original gift... The best of his poems are
among the most beautifully written in our time." Penguin Classics recently
reissued *Doveglion: Collected Poems, *a compilation of Villa's work,
including rare and previously unpublished material.

*Luis H. Francia*, reknowned writer and poet, discusses Villa and reads fro=
m
 *Doveglion*, and will also read from his own* Eye of the Fish: A Personal
Archipelago*. Francia's semi-autobiographical account of life straddling
American and Philippine culture won the Pen Center Beyond the Margin Award
and The Asian American Writers' Workshop Literary Award in 2002.

OK. But that's not what I was saying.

You're right about the element of time travel being not essential to the
situation. But it does serve to focus attention on the problem of choice
from one moment to the next.

In that scenario, if we think that events would have to unfold as they did
previously, then any decision any time is questionable. Because if we think
that events would have had to unfold as they did previously THAT TIME, then
events would have had to unfold as they did ANY TIME. Wouldn't they? Because
there was nothing exceptional about THAT TIME.

So that when we seek some possibility of anything happening differently than
it did, it seems that what might have been is an abstraction remaining a
perpetual possibility only in a world of speculation.

 In what ways did Cavafy stand
at an angle to the universe? He was born in Alexandria in 1863 to a
family that could trace its lineage back to the nobility of the
Byzantine Empire. His father=2C originally from Constantinople=2C was a
partner in a successful export business that maintained offices in
London and Liverpool as well as several cities in Egypt=3B the young
Cavafy lived in England for five years=2C acquiring both a longstanding
fascination with English poetry and a slightly British inflection that
accented his Greek. But when his father died=2C Cavafy=92s family was
plunged into poverty. Socially=2C linguistically=2C personally=2C Cavafy
lived on the outskirts. He had his first homo=ADsexual affair around the
age of 20. Soon after=2C he found a job in the Irrigation Office of the
Ministry of Public Works =97 the =93Third Circle of Irrigation=94 =97 where=
 he
worked for more than 30 years. He wrote consistently but almost never
published through traditional means. There is nothing more detrimental
to art=2C he maintained=2C than succumbing to =93how the public thinks and
what it likes and what it will buy.=94
Today=2C Cavafy is well known
for writing what might initially seem like two kinds of poems.
Beginning in 1911=2C he wrote poems depicting homosexual desire with an
unsensational directness: =93They were slow getting dressed=2C they were
sorry to cover / the beauty of their supple nudity / which harmonized
so well with the comeliness of their faces.=94 At the same time=2C he wrote
poems about Greek history =97 not the well-known glories of the classical
era but the long decline that finally concluded with the collapse of
the Byzantine Empire: =93He wasn=92t completely wrong=2C poor old Gemistus =
/
(let Lord Andronicus and the patriarch suspect him if they like)=2C / in
wanting us=2C telling us to become pagan once again.=94=20
But as
Mendelsohn argues in his elegant introduction to the poems=2C any
division between the erotic and historical poems is facile. Whether
Cavafy is describing an ancient political intrigue or an erotic
encounter that occurred last week=2C his topic is the passage of time.
The lines I=92ve just quoted are in fact from the same unfinished poem=2C
=93After the Swim=94: the naked youths=2C dressing on the beach=2C are reve=
aled
to be students of Gemistus=2C a Byzantine Neo=ADplatonist who was condemned
by authorities of the Orthodox Church for proclaiming that Zeus was the
supreme god.
In Cavafy=92s world=2C everything has already happened.
The fortune is spent=2C the pantheon abandoned=2C the body grown old. This
overpowering sense of belatedness is what provokes the tone of his
poems =97 rueful=2C distanced=2C knowing but never wise. Mendelsohn maintai=
ns
that=2C given the translatability of Cavafy=92s tone=2C he has focused his
attention on =93other aspects of the poetry=94 =97 the exquisite care Cavaf=
y
took with diction=2C syntax=2C meter and rhyme. But in fact this is not
exactly the case. It is only through attention to these minute aspects
of poetic language that tone is produced. And Mendelsohn is assiduously
attentive.
Earlier translators have=2C to varying degrees=2C rightly
emphasized the prosaic flatness of Cavafy=92s language=3B the flatness is
crucial to the emotional power of the poems=2C since it prevents their
irony from seeming caustic=2C their longing from seeming nostalgic. But
as Mendelsohn shows=2C Cavafy=92s language was in subtle ways more
artificial than we=92ve understood. Most important=2C Cavafy mingled high
and low diction=2C employing both vernacular Greek and a literary Greek
invented at the turn of the 19th century. Taking advantage of the fact
that English contains words descended not only from German but from
Latin roots=2C Mendelsohn=92s translations shift similarly between the
lofty and the mundane:

I ask myself whether in antique times

glorious Alexandria possessed a=20

	youth more beauteous=2C

a kid more perfect than he.

This
poem=2C =93Days of 1909=2C =9210=2C and =9211=2C=94 extols the beauty of a
working-class boy who sells his body to buy expensive clothes. The
tensions between high and low are registered in the diction. Following
a line dominated by Latinate words (glorious=2C possessed=2C beauteous)=2C
the Germanic and colloquial monosyllable in the third line carries an
unexpected poignancy: a kid.
=20





 This shift in diction lets us
hear something crucial about Cavafy=92s tone (a directness that is never
not elegant)=2C but it also lets Mendelsohn=92s translation exist fully as
an English poem. Because of the polyglot nature of the English
language=2C the sound of great English poetry is the sound of
monosyllabic Germanic words chiming against multisyllabic Latinate
words (Shakespeare=92s =93seas incarnadine=94 or Tennyson=92s =93immemorial
elms=94). Echoing such effects=2C Mendelsohn makes me wonder if it wasn=92t
the deliciously mongrel nature of English=2C which Cavafy spoke and wrote
perfectly=2C that first provoked him to forge his own hybridized idiom.
The fact that the few poems Cavafy wrote in English contain phrases
like =93penetrating eye=94 and =93transcendent star=94 (the Latinate word
wedged against the Germanic) suggests that the poet=92s ear for English
was at least as acute as his translator=92s.
Mendelsohn is a classicist=2C essayist and memoirist=2C the author of =93Th=
e Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million.=94
His translations of Cavafy=92s poems come trailing commentaries in which
an immense amount of learning is gracefully and usefully borne. But
Mendelsohn thinks like a poet=2C which is to say he inhabits the meaning
of language through its movement. Listen to his translation of the
famous concluding lines of =93The God Abandons Antony=94:

Like one who=92s long prepared=2C like someone brave=2C

as befits a man who=92s been blessed with a city like this=2C

go without faltering toward the window

and listen with deep emotion=2C but not

with the entreaties and the whining of a coward=2C

to the sounds =97 a final entertainment =97=20

to the exquisite instruments of that initiate crew=2C

The White and the Black, Reflections on Fog - 10 years

A pionner cyberliterature work, created by Regina Pinto in 1999

WE CAN NOT JUDGE

OR THE WHITE - IS WORSE,

The eletronic artist=92s book =93The White and the Black, Reflections on
Fog=94, created in 1999, is being re-launched (original version). Now
the download is very fast, but in 1999, it was necessary much time to
watch it. So, in 2001, it became a cd-rom. How technology develops
fast! Will it be that in 2019 it will be possible to see this work
yet? =85 How will the internet be in 2019? And the computers?

Subject: [BULK] "War Rug" - Poetry Film Screening



"War Rug," a poetry film based on the long poem of the same name will be
screened on April 17th, 2009 at FLATFILE galleries, 217 North Carpenter
Street, Chicago IL. The screening will be part of a larger event and =
will
take place around 8:30 - 9 p.m.

If you're not in Chicago and would like to preview the film, it will
available online for a limited time at the following link:

http://www.francescolevato.com/media/War_Rug.htm


"War Rug" is a work of documentary poetics in the form of a book length
poem. Multiple interwoven narratives explore life within zones of =
conflict
as viewed through the lens of current warfare. The narratives range from
passages inspired by journal entries, firsthand accounts, and news =
reports
to poetic constructs collaged from military doctrine, Freedom of =
Information
Act released government documents (like CIA interrogation manuals, and
detainee autopsy reports), and numerous other sources.

The film collages and juxtaposes archival source material with U.S. =
Military
footage in an exploration of alternative narrative interpretations of =
the
source text.


The film screening is part of "The Marriage of Poetry" featuring =
readings by
Danielle Chapman & Dan-Beachy Quick, with live musical performances by =
Pont
des Arts Ensemble & The Jim Barbick Trio. The main event starts at 6 =
p.m.

For those of you interested in literary theory, I have been developing idea=
s towards the creation of a new branch of literary theory. I call it "I.T."=
: Internet Theory. This theory, which is still in the formative stages, att=
empts to work out the implications, formal characteristics, and inherent pr=
operties of "digital text," "digital consciousness," and "Reception Velocit=
y," among other things. I have done a solid week of it here:
=A0
http://www.adamfieled.blogspot.com

I hope that others will join with me in exploring these ideas. A new contex=
t for literature is a new chance to redefine it, as it was, is, and can be.
Best,

DO contact Marjan with any questions; she's very interested in building up
her gallery in Iran, in particular.

Note that blogging is now illegal inside Tehran; oftentimes snailmail and
reading statements, etc. is the way university students have contact with
artists.

Marjan's previous show, in MOCA Tehran, included works by Bill Viola and
Masami Teraoka.

I bet works that query ideas of globalization, censorship, women's and
minority rights, 1M signatures, etc. are particularly welcome.

Adventures in the Sim Trade:

Accidental Art and Performance in Second Life


June 2008 through March 2009, I worked in an installation/performance
space called Odyssey in the virtual world Second Life. I changed the
environment daily, reflecting dynamic (moving, shuddering) complex spaces
that were narratives in their own right, difficult to navigate, built on
phenomenologies of being virtually real, really virtual. I will walk/work
my way through these transformations, presenting videos and images of
installations (with Azure Carter), dance (with Foofwa d'Imobilite and
Sandy Baldwin), and performance (with Sandy Baldwin). This work is unique
within and without Second Life.

From the original information sheet (all this and more will be explained!)


How to view The Accidental Artist exhibition in Second Life

The exhibition is quite complex; here's some suggestions when visiting:

1. Try turning the glow off. Go to preferences, graphics, and uncheck
basic shading, if it's on. Basic shading seems to use up more resources
than anything else with the rendering engine. You can also set things like
rendering distance; the lower the distance, the faster the loading.

2. Turn the video media button off. This on the lower right-hand corner of
the screen. If you turn it on, the texture-mapping consumes a huge amount
of resources. On the other hand, the audio for the parcel (the audio
button) runs fairly lean.

3. If you find the space too cluttered to enter, try flying in.

4. If you find flying in too cluttered, fly higher, and drop in. There is
a dome in the center of the space which you can enter.

5. Most objects on the ground level (and some beneath the ground, on the
seafloor) will flee from you - what looks crowded from a distance might
well clear out.

6. If it clears out, look up - you'll see all sorts of things above you.

7. Fly vertically to see the rest of the exhibition. If you can't fly as
high as you want, click control-alt-d, which opens up an advanced menu.
Open the menu and get rid of camera constraints. You can then move the
camera at a great distance from your avatar body - your viewpoint moves
independently, and you can move at least to the top of the exhibition,
which is maybe a mile or so up, SL measurement.

8. If you get stuck anywhere, teleport back in.

9. Try moving inside the objects; the interior textures are often
different from the exterior ones (this is almost always the case with the
spheres).

10. You can push objects vertically into the sky by moving beneath them
and flying; they flee upwards.

11. You can see the exhibition 'differently' by using the advanced menu,
going to render, and then looking for info - clicking on any one of the
info options will give you different viewpoints.

12. You can often sit on moving objects, which will whirl you around; if
you sit on an object that moves vertically as a result of your proximity,
you can ride it up. When you stand up again, you can fall down back into
the space. The riding height seems to be around 4117 SL units, but unless
you have a flight bracelet or feather, you probably won't go that high.

13. Moving about on the ground level, keep the sound turned on (lower
right), and you'll hear a variety of songs about SL and language. These
mix with a number of looping sound modules embedded in the space.

14. If you've been moving around SL a lot, go to preferences, and empty
your cache; this might speed things up. You'll have to restart SL again.

15. If you see a sign for teleporting, try it. Sometimes it will lead back
to the ground level, sometimes to the seabed, sometimes to a skysphere.
All of these locations have clickable objects which will take you else-
where (or back to the same space but at a slightly different location).
You might have to right-click on the object, then click on teleport - or
you might just left click - it depends on the object.

16, Try different 'lenses' - click on control-8 to make the image wide-
angle, control-9 to return to normal, control-0 for telephoto. Repeated
clicks work as well - with control-8 you can create extreme distortions.

17. Try moving into 'small' spaces and look about. You can save snapshots
of anything you see, on your hard drive.

18. That's about it. The general idea is to run lean, fly about, teleport
back if you're stuck, play with the controls. The architecture is constan-
tly changing and deconstructing itself - play with that....

a good response would be 'so what?' why would we want to do those things
from a command line? it's easier to do them in the google graphic interface.

i agree.

the significance of goosh.org is what it offers programmers.

imagine net art programs that make calls to google image search when they
need images (dbcinema does that already, as do various other net art
programs); or when ai is required, the programmer might send user text to a
web service for analysis. and get a response back very quickly.

the era of the net art app is more or less here. as there start to be lots
of great web services available, the artistic imagination will do
interesting and beautiful things with these services in programs whose
bodies are distributed over the net--and hopefully dramatic and useful
things also!

Hi Poets,

Is there a NYer out there with a digital video camera who could help me out?
I am trying to record our Segue event on poetry and architecture this
Saturday. If you are experienced in doing this kind of thing, and if you
come for 2 hours and record the event, I will pay you for doing that. Please
backchannel me at tscotpeterson@gmail.com if interested.

Best,

Tim Peterson

Edmond Chibeau is a performance writer who teaches "Scriptwriting" and =
"History of Communication" at Eastern Connecticut State University.  =
Chibeau believes we are Microchip Aboriginals, living in the Ur =
Civilization of the Digital Age. The quantum space between the zeros and =
ones of the binary number system allows for a digital ekphrasis of the =
scirbal analogue of phonetic space.  In other words; the phonetic =
alphabet texts us.  His play, The Norwich Nine, about civil war soldiers =
buried in Norwich, Connecticut, was performed at Eastern Connecticut =
State University on April 19th.  He will be giving the keynote address =
for IMPAC-Connecticut State Wide Ceremony of the  Dublin Literary Award =
on April 28th.  Chibeau=92s work has been performed at Lincoln Center, =
The Knitting Factory, NoSeNO, The Ear Inn, and elsewhere.  He has worked =
with John Cage, Alison Knowles, Kenneth Rexroth, Allen Ginsberg, & =
Charles Bernstein, among others. =20

Composer Anthony Cornicello writes music that blurs distinctions between =
performers and electronics, timbre and harmony, composition and =
improvisation, and explores the boundaries of what may be considered =
post-classical concert music.  He has been commissioned to write music =
for the Scorchio Electric String Quartet, ModernWorks!, the Auros Group =
for New Music, the Prism Saxophone Quartet, the New York New Music =
Ensemble, David Holzman, the Group for Contemporary Music, and the =
InterEnsemble of Padova, Italy.  His work has also been featured on the =
Guggenheim Museum=92s =93Works and Process=94 series. Cornicello=92s =
works have also been performed by the Chicago Civic Symphony, Parnassus, =
ALEA III, Composers Concordance, Madeleine Shapiro, Robert Black, among =
others.  Cornicello has begun performing on the laptop, using a variety =
of interfaces and the Max/MSP program.  Those performances, mostly with =
EEE!, have had a notable impact on his music, as EEE!=92s music ranges =
from hip-hop to experimental noise. EEE! is based at Eastern Connecticut =
State University, where Cornicello is an Associate Professor and =
Director of the Electronic Music Lab.

Jonathan Monroe's contributions are drawn from Demosthenes' Legacy =
(Ahadada 2009), a cross-genre work of prose poetry, poetics, and short =

THE BOSTON GLOBE: (Living Arts: Feb. 8, 2000.)

Poetic Healing: As the hospital and its clients have changed, counselor=20=

Douglas Holder adds another dimension.

By Michael Kenney (Globe Staff)

SOMERVILLE=97In the fourth collection of poetry of poetry Douglas Holder =
has=20
published at his Ibbetson Street Press here, he includes a poem of his ow=
n,=20
titled: =93 A Simple Nod.=94

I saw him in Harvard Square,
happily walking with a friend.
As we passed each other
we exchanged a simple, understated
nod.
Our silence was a friendly conspiracy
a reminder of where he once was
and where he was
now.

The where is never stated=97although two words, =93the ward,=94 a few lin=
es=20
further on provide a hint. Holder, 44, is a mental health counselor, and =
for the=20
past six years he has been conducting poetry workshops at McLean Hospital=
=20
for its patients.

=93 I=92d been working there 17 years, and I=92d had my poetry published =
in small=20
journals,=94 he says. I wanted to add another dimension to my job and hel=
p a=20
few folks out.=94

While Holder would not think of ranking himself with Anne Sexton, who won=
=20
the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1967, he does invoke the legendary poetr=
y=20
workshops she conducted at McLean in the late 1960s. Sexton, a patient at=
=20
the Belmont hospital in 1973, committed suicide in October 1974.

Nor does Holder claim that the hospital today resemble the institution of=
 those=20
years. =93It=92s not like the old McLean,=94 he says, =93with patrician t=
ypes sitting=20
around drinking tea from bone china.=94 That was the McLean of Harvard=20=

fullbacks, Porcellian Club members, and =93 Mayflower screwballs.=94 That=
 was the=20
McLean that Robert Lowell, a frequent patient there in the 1960=92s,=20
memorialized in his poem =93Waking in the Blue,=94 and that writer Susann=
a=20
Kaysen, a patient in 1967, recalls in her best-selling memoir =93Girl Int=
errupted,=94=20
now a major motion picture.

Today, Holder says, the members of his poetry groups are more likely to b=
e=20
the homeless =93 coming in with a bit of doggerel.=94

He runs two workshops, one on Thursday afternoons for patients in the=20
hospital=92s open-ward program, which meets in a converted Victorian mans=
ion,=20
and other Friday evenings for patients on two locked wards where Holder=20=

works. Neither is open to an outside visitor.



But whether in the mansion or in the more institutional setting of the lo=
cked=20
ward, Holder says, =93 I try to sort of have a coffeehouse atmosphere. We=
=92ll=20
have a round of applause when some reads a poem.=94=20

Of course it doesn=92t always work out as planned.

Holder remembers reading Allen Ginsberg=92s =93Howl=94 at his very first =
workshop.

=93I was pretty enthusiastic then, and a bit na=EFve,=94 he says. I thoug=
ht they=92d=20
like it. I saw the poem=97with its lament about the =93best minds of his=20=

generation lost to madness=94=97as a haunting cry that would be a catalys=
t for=20
discussion.=94

And he says with some self-deprecation, =93 I thought they=92d think of m=
e as, =93=20
Hey, this guy knows where I am coming from.=94

Instead , =93they were angry and one of them walked out,=94 he says. =93A=
nd one=20
of them told me: =93Why do I have to hear this? I live with it.=94

Another time, Holder says, a young woman became hysterical and ran out=20=

when he read a poem of his own about a kosher butcher in Brookline.

=93It turned out the young woman had a painful experience in her life, wh=
ich she=20
associated with chickens, and she couldn=92t take it,=94 Holder says. =93=
 I had a lot=20
of explaining to do with the clinical staff.=94

=93You never know,=94 he adds, =93when you might hit a vein.=94

The problem is compounded, Holder says, by the fact that today=92s hospit=
al=20
stays tend to be shorter=97a week or two instead of several months. =93Yo=
u=20
don=92t always know what to expect,=94 he says.

It also means that the workshops aren=92t quite they were in Sexton=92s d=
ay.

=93I get in their face about it,=94 Holder says. =93 I=92ll go around to =
the rooms in my=20
wards and ask: =93Are you coming to the poetry group tonight?=92

=93And sometimes, I=92ll have a doctor or another staff person tell me th=
at so-and-
so is a well-known writer, so I=92ll make a special effort to get them to=
 come.=94

A number of poems written by patients in these workshops have been=20
published=97usually anonymously in the now defunct Boston Poet and other=20=

small poetry magazines. But not in his own magazine, which shares the nam=
e=20
of his small press, Holder says, because that would violate hospital poli=
cy.

Because he believes that poetry can play a healing role, Holder started=20=

Ibbetson Street Press, out of house in Somerville=97naming it after the s=
treet=20
where he lives with his wife, Dianne Robitaille, a poet and geriatric nur=
se.

Holder, who got a master=92s degree in literature from Harvard=92s extens=
ion school=20
while working at McLean, has been publishing his poetry in small magazine=
s=20
and especially Spare Change, the monthly journal for the homeless. =93I w=
rite a=20
lot about homelessness and mental health problems.=94

Starting a small press to publish local poets, Holder says, was =93 a way=
 to get=20
connected.=94

The most recent issue=9738 pages on 81/2 by 11 paper with a paper cover,=20=

bound with black slip plastic binder=97sells for $4 and contains 40 poems=
; an=20
interview with Ed Galing, an elderly small press poet; and several review=
s.

Among the poets are a number of first-time writers and others described=20=

as =93mainstays=94 of Holder=92s press. There are also two professors of =
literature=97
John Hildebidle, who teaches at MIT, and Robert K. Johnson, who teaches a=
t=20
Suffolk University=97as well as Don DiVecchio, the poetry editor of Spare=
=20
Change.

Ibbetson Street Press has also published a number of chapbooks, and old=20=

English term for a small collection of poems or ballads, most recently: P=
oems=20
=46rom 42nd Street=94 by Rufus Goodwin, a poet and journalist who lives i=
n=20
Boston; and a collection called =93 Poems for the Poet, the Working Man a=
nd the=20
Downtrodden,=94 by A.D. Winans, who published a small poetry magazine in =
San=20
Francisco.

=93What distinguishes our journal,=94 says Holder, =93is that it contains=
 poems that=20
anyone can read.=94 They deal =93with everyday life. There=92s not a lot =
of arcane=20
words or funny verse patterns.=94 Anyone, he adds,=94 can get something o=
ut of=20
them.=94



The following is a poem written by an anonymous participant in one of Dou=
glas=20
Holder=92s poetry workshops at McLean Hospital:


When The Hunter Arrived.

When the hunter arrived
at the place
where it was unfamiliar
he became the prey
stalked by everything
ever unleashed
by the conspiracy of creation.
to the edge he cantered
idols toppling by his sides
until at last
those that were against him
trusted his insight into their
essential nature
Finally pushing a hole through
God=92s left eye
past what had separately
designed the limitless war
streaming beyond infinity.

*/The Cowles Family endowment for the study of public service presents:/*

*Dissent and American Democracy*

*Friday, April 24^th
1:00-3:00pm
Cowles Auditorium, Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs,
University of Minnesota
301 19^th Avenue South, Minneapolis, MN*

*/Following the speakers, an open forum will be moderated by Joe Soss,
Cowles Professor for the Study of Public Service/*

*“The Intersections of Dissent*”: What is the value of dissent within a
democracy, and how is it best promoted and protected? Does the term
“dissent” capture the values, rights, and groups that we think need to
be protected? Framed as an abstract principle, can the goals of
protecting “dissent” be appropriated, deployed, and diluted in ways that
lead to the exclusion or suppression of the voices of some marginalized
groups? *Dara Strolovitch* will discuss these multiple valences of
dissent, focusing in particular on their relationships with the
intersecting politics of race, class, gender, and sexuality.

*"The Suppression of Dissent":* Over the past century, actors in
government and mass media have repeatedly taken steps to silence
political dissent in theUnited States. Focusing on surveillance as a
critical step in the process of suppression, *Jules Boykoff* will
explore the historical and contemporary development of efforts to limit
dissent. How do such efforts affect the practice of democracy in the
United States? How can activists sidestep these efforts and raise the
chances that dissenting voices will be heard?

*Dara Z. Strolovitch* (Ph.D. Yale University, 2002) is Associate
Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota. She is
the author of /Affirmative Advocacy: Race, Class, and Gender in Interest
Group Politics/ (University of Chicago Press 2007).

*Jules Boykoff* (Ph.D. American University, 2004) is Assistant Professor
in the Department of Politics and Government at Pacific University in
Oregon. He is the author of /Beyond Bullets: The Suppression of Dissent
in the United States/ (AK Press, 2007).


*Saturday April 25
POETRY READING
*
*Poets Jules Boykoff and Kaia Sand read*
7:30 pm, 3440 Park Avenue, Mpls. (Maria Damon's house)
Snacks at 7:00 BYOB.

*Jules Boykoff *is the author of /Beyond Bullets: The Suppression of
Dissent in the United States/ (AK Press, 2007), /The Suppression of
Dissent: How the State and Mass Media Squelch USAmerican Social
Movements/ (Routledge, 2006) and /Landscapes of Dissent: Guerrilla
Poetry & Public Space/ (co-authored with Kaia Sand) (Palm Press, 2008).
He is also the author of two collections of poetry. He teaches political
science and writing at Pacific University in Oregon.

*Kaia Sand* is the author of the poetry collection /interval/ (Edge
Books 2004), selected as a Small Press Traffic Book of the Year. Dusie
Press published her wee book, /lotto/. She has led poetry walks in
Portland, and a book that includes these walks, /Remember to Wave/, is

This multimedia presentation consists of spoken word, videography, and
jazz quintet is Langston Hughes=92 commentary on the struggle for freedom a=
nd
equality of African Americans and Africans during the 1960s.  By way of
videography, this concert performance links the words and music of Hughes=
=92
poetry to topical images of Ask Your Mama's people, places, and events, and
to the works of the visual artists.   Langston Hughes admired or
collaborated
with most closely over the course of his career -- the African-inspired
mural designs and cubist
> geometries of Aaron Douglas, the blues and jazz-inspired collages of
> Romare Bearden, t he  macabre grotesques of Meta Warrick Fuller and
> the rhythmic sculptural figurines and heads and bas reliefs of
> Richmond Barthe, the color blocked cityscapes and black history series
> of Palmer Hayden and Jacob Lawrence. Together the words, sounds, and
> images recreate a magical moment in our cultural history, which
> bridges the Harlem Renaissance, the post World War II Beat writers'
> coffeehouse jazz poetry world, and the looming Black Arts performance
> explosion of the 1960s.

I wrote a shoot-em-up online poetry game a while ago called Arteroids (
http://vispo.com/arteroids ). It's currently being exhibited in Leipzig,
Germany at D21 in a show called LET'S RESTART!!! curated by Michael Arzt.
Leipzig is in what was the Communist sector of Germany. The show at D21
features five computer games/works of art. All the games are accessible via
the Internet. They are for free public access.

Here are some pictures from the opening at D21 in Leipzig:
http://vispo.com/arteroids/leipzig . The D21 site is at
http://d21-leipzig.de/restart where you can read descriptions of the games,
links to the games themselves, and Michael's introduction to the show.

Bird Dog: A dog used to retrieve game birds. To follow a subject on =20
interest with persistent attention. A scout . . .

Bird Dog was founded in 2002 by Sarah Mangold. It publishes innovative =20=

work from emerging and established writers with a focus on longer =20

**Stephanie Carlin

http://www.myspace.com/stephaniecarlinrock

Stephanie Carlin just released her second EP, "the Agony and Ecstasy =20
of." The CD, captivating the gut-wrenching loves and losses of the =20
human heart, led to her first opportunity to reject a record contract, =20=

which involved: Tommy Hilfiger; an aging producer who, based on his =20
awkward mohawk, was dying to be accepted by Hot Topic pre-teens; and =20
participating in multiple slutty modeling shoots in exchange for =20
tasteless ClearChannel marketing.

Carlin self-released her first EP at 16, which led to the formation of =20=

Long Island sensation Oliver Lankard. For a while, Oliver Lankard was =20=

four-piece band, then a seven-piece band, and even a ten-piece band, =20
complete with a three-piece horn section and three doo-wop back-up =20
vocalists. She managed the band while performing as lead vocalist and =20=

guitarist. Under her supervision, Oliver Lankard performed over 50 =20
shows at notable venues like The Knitting Factory, Maxwell=92s, and The =20=

Crazy Donkey. In their short time together, Oliver Lankard opened for =20=

The Hold Steady keyboardist Franz Nicolay and performed alongside =20
Prentiss McNeil of legendary group The Drifters.

 =46rom violently chastising American democracy to glorifying =20
spontaneous love, her original lyrics are as wildly inventive as her =20
impulsive scat-singing. With influences ranging from Elliott Smith to =20=

Ella Fitzgerald, the clarity of her obscurity is quite fascinating.


**Kate Eichhorn
http://www.bookthug.ca/proddetail.php?prod=3D3254

Kate Eichhorn is the author of Fond (BookThug) and the co-editor of =20
Innovative Canadian Women's Poetry and Poetics (Coach House Books). As =20=

a curator, she has worked with reading series and literary festivals =20
to stage multidisciplinary collaborations between poets, visual =20
artists, and composers. She is an assistant professor of culture and =20
media studies at The New School.


**Sandy Florian

the chapbook 32 Pedals & 47 Stops (Tarpaulin Sky Press). She is the =20
current writer in residence at the New College of Florida in Sarasota. =20=

For Easter's Wordplay, I featured a reading by Jonathan Williams from
1981, the year his collection Get Hot or Get Out appeared. The reading
features some work from that book that's grounded in the work of
Charles Ives, work that's not been republished.

Second generation Jargonaut Jeffery Beam kindly loaned me the tapes of
his RainTaxi interview with Jonathan from 2003, so I I included part
of that session in the show as well.

There's also music by Ives, Monk, Ralph Vaughn Williams, Judy Garland,
and the inimitable Mike Harding. (Who? Check out Wikipedia).

The production note with the link to the show is right here:

Enjoy,

e forms, languages, critical fields. As performance and as printed text the=
 work collects, gathers over time and space, and forms a kind of conversati=
on about the feminist avant-garde, what it is and how it comes to be. Our a=
nniversary Elders Series is a
 continuation of this conversation, which highlights the fact of influence =

The Segue Series Presents

POETRY & ARCHITECTURE

Vito Acconci, Benjamin Aranda and Robert Kocik

Saturday, April 25, 2009 ** 4PM SHARP**
Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, NYC
$6 admission
hosted by Kristen Gallagher & Tim Peterson

What is the nature of the conversation between poetry and architecture
today? In this event for the Segue Reading Series, poets and architects wil=
l
present works exploring a dialogue between these two disciplines.

Vito Acconci will show an image-stream of built & unbuilt spaces &
instruments as he reads: 1) about furniture & houses (80's), cities &
landscape (90's); 2) from rules for assemblage & incursion (00's); 3)
architecture in words only (00's). Benjamin Aranda will present images and
talk around the issue of self-assembly, where top-down methods for
determining form and making decisions are complicated and sometimes replace=
d
by bottom-up rules of formation. As in natural systems, the architectural
structures up for discussion are not carved or composed in a traditional
sense; they are grown through simple interactions to produce complex
patterns that are both useful and buildable. Robert Kocik will present a
plan for the Prosody Building, a note on mercenary poetry (without which
business is biocide), Missing Civic Services, and a few architectural plans
made entirely of words.

PARTICIPANTS:

Vito Acconci's design & architecture comes from another direction, from
backgrounds of writing & art. By the late 80's he crossed over & joined wit=
h
architects to form Acconci Studio. They mix poetry & math,
computer-scripting & sentence-structure, narrative & biology as they range
from plazas & parks to buildings & interiors to furniture & products to
clothing &vehicles. They are currently working on a street through a
building in Indianapolis, a building that twists from a courtyard in Milan,
a makeover of a former strip-mall in Athens, Georgia.

Benjamin Aranda is architect and principal of Aranda\Lasch, New York, NY.

Robert Kocik, poet, essayist, artist, design/builder, lives in Brooklyn
where he directs the Bureau of Material Behaviors. His architectural works
are committed to the realization of 'missing' functions, services,
organizations, or agencies. He is currently developing a building based on
'prosody' and poets' imagined importance to our society. With the
choreographer Daria Fa=EFn, he has initiated a field of research called The
Prosodic Body. His publications include: Overcoming Fitness (Autonomedia,
2001), and Rhrurbarb (Field Books, 2007).

The deadline for submitting to *Reconfigurations* stimulating critical
essays and cultural works (poems, paintings, etc) that address the emergence
and applications of non-Western frameworks of knowledge has been shifted to
1 June 2009, to make it possible for those still working on their
submissions to be able to complete them. We thank those who have already
submitted their works for peer review. As previously announced, essays that
engage the politics of locating knowledge production and transnational
movements of academic expertise are also welcome. Submissions should be
emailed to Obododimma Oha  (mmanwu@go.com , udude@full-moon.com ) or to
Scott Howard, the editor of *Reconfigurations* (showard@du.edu ). Each
submitter should please send a short bio of not more than 200 words. Text
files should be on Word, rtf, or PDF (provided the PDF is not locked), while
images should be on JPEG format. For more information on the journal, please

The work in this wondrous first major book by Jennifer Scappettone has
a phenomenal -- an excitatory -- presence, the presence of action, not
thing. This book is a matrix of polytemporal energy, a linguistic
carnival, ribald and resounding -- "a most implicit maze."...

Today I'm missing everyone's favorite found poet Bern Porter. Here's a
rock version of him jamming on Last Acts of Saint Fuck You in the

Subject:      Marcus McCann's soft where (poetry, Chaudiere Books)

Last night we launched Ottawa poet and journalist Marcus McCann's first
trade poetry collection, soft where, to a rousing crowd at the ottawa
international writers festival, with poets Jeanette Lynes and Molly
Peacock along for the ride to help, launching titles of their own. Check
out the links below for direct information on McCann's book, as well as a
link to a report on last night's event. Keep an eye either on our facebook
page or blog (chaudierebooks.blogspot.com) for further McCann launches in
Toronto and Montreal, as well as information on Fredericton poet Joe
Blades forthcoming poetry title.

3 Guys from Albany, a poetry performance group, will tour Colorado
and Wyoming from May 2 through May 8, including a performance in
Albany, Wyoming on May 4.  The group will also visit  Cheyenne, WY,
Denver, CO and Loveland, CO.  The complete itinerary is listed below.

3 Guys from Albany (Tom Nattell, Charlie Rossiter and Dan Wilcox)
have a mission to read their poetry in each of the Albanys in the
U.S.  They are friends who share the idea that poetry should be a
part of society rather than apart from it -- relevant, communicative
and, above all, honest.  Their poems address social issues such as
the homeless, peace and war, and the environment, as well as joyful
celebrations of art, love and life.  They have toured the United
States since 1993 and so far they have read in 11 of the 18 Albanys
in the USA.  They have released a 60-minute cassette tape and CD of
their poetry performance, available at their readings or by mail.
Although Tom Nattell died of cancer in January, 2005, Charlie & Dan
are continuing the project, along with the ever-present nudging from
the spirit of Tom.

Charlie Rossiter is a recipient of an NEA fellowship for his poetry
and is the host of www.poetrypoetry.com.

Dan Wilcox hosts the Third Thursday open mic at the Social Justice
Center in Albany, NY & has the world's largest collection of photos
of unknown poets.  You can find him at dwlcx.blogspot.com

Tom Nattell was an international mail artist, environmentalist, poet
and peace activist who wrote the "Simple Life" column for Metroland,
Albany's entertainment weekly.

Look for them at an Albany near you!



Sunday, May 3:  CCTV 54, Louisville CO -- Talking poetry & reading
poems on the Poets Co-op TV show, 7:00 p.m.

Monday, May 4: Albany, WY -- exact time & place to be determined,
free (if you can find it, show up)

Tuesday, May 5: The Albany Restaurant, Bar and Liquor Store,
Cheyenne, WY, 7:30, free.

Wednesday, May 6: Glovinsky Gallery, 800 W. 8th Ave, #116, Denver, CO
(8th & Inca 1 block east of Santa Fe, use Inca St. entrance).
A brief open mic will open the evening, followed by 3 Guys from Albany
For more info: 303-587-4237, Janet Glovinsky: jglovinsky@yahoo.com
free

Thursday, May 7: Loveland Museum, 503 N. Lincoln Ave., Loveland CO,

thanks for that, paul.

al purdy lived in victoria during the winter, so i got a chance to meet him
a few times.

he invited me into his house and we drank a rum together. his wife eurithe
also was there. i responded to something he said by remarking that, of
course, he was a sensitive man. "yes," said eurithe, "a sensitive man with
no sensitivity."

"a fine distinction, my dear." said al.

but she stayed with him till the end.

al and i got to talking about poets and poetry and he said "you know, most
of the poets i've ever known aren't poets anymore."

he was in his eighties at that point, had won all the canadian prizes twice,
and his collected poems had just been published a couple of years before
this.

i organized a couple of readings for him in victoria. they were fun events.
and packed. packed houses and al had fun and delivered his poems at length
and very well.

he really did know how to enjoy living his life, and he surely did.

ja

A Night with Award-Winning Author Ha Jin
Reading and Cocktail Reception in support of the Asian American Writers'
Workshop

Wednesday, May 06, 2009
6:30 PM to 9:00 PM

Home of Virginia Davies and Willard Taylor
299 West 12th Street #PHA
New York, New York 10014
off 8th Ave

Please join us for an intimate evening with writer Ha Jin, winner of the
National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. The Workshop is
proud to welcome Jin and to present the public with a rare opportunity to
meet the authorat a classic West Village penthouse with wraparound terrace
that has hosted Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Yo-Yo Ma.

This special event focuses on Jins newest book, Writer as Migrant, published
by the University of Chicago Press. In his first work of nonfiction, Jin
writes three interconnected essays and tackles issues relating to being a
migrant writer. The San Francisco Chronicle finds that "Though the issues
are weighty, Jins prose is straightforward and welcoming. . . . In this
poignant and provocative book, Jin takes us on this journey [to our
envisioned homelands], revealing paths laid by migrant writers before him
and perhaps by those who will follow."

Ha Jin is the critically renowned author of five novels, including, Waiting
and War Trash, as well as three collections of short stories and three books
of poetry. His short story collection, The Bridegroom, won the Asian
American Literary Award. He currently teaches literature at Boston
University.

Albany, a poetry performance group, will tour Colorado and Wyoming from May=
 2 through May 8, including a performance in Albany, Wyoming on May 4.  The=
 group will also visit  Cheyenne, WY, Denver, CO and Loveland, CO.  The com=
plete itinerary is listed below.=0A=0A3 Guys from Albany (Tom Nattell, Char=
lie Rossiter and Dan Wilcox) have a mission to read their poetry in each of=
 the Albanys in the U.S.  They are friends who share the idea that poetry s=
hould be a part of society rather than apart from it -- relevant, communica=
tive and, above all, honest.  Their poems address social issues such as the=
 homeless, peace and war, and the environment, as well as joyful celebratio=
ns of art, love and life.  They have toured the United States since 1993 an=
d so far they have read in 11 of the 18 Albanys in the USA.  They have rele=
ased a 60-minute cassette tape and CD of their poetry performance, availabl=
e at their readings or by mail.  Although Tom Nattell died of cancer in Jan=
uary, 2005, Charlie & Dan are continuing the project, along with the ever-p=
resent nudging from the spirit of Tom.=0A=0ACharlie Rossiter is a recipient=
 of an NEA fellowship for his poetry and is the host of www.poetrypoetry.co=

UnlikelyStories.org is pleased to open submissions for our 2009 July
Fourth Issue, guest edited by Luis Cuauhtemoc Berriozabal. We'll be
seeking essays on today's U.S.A., as well as visual art, film, music,
poetry, fiction and creative non-fiction, interviews with notable
American thinkers, and reviews of works on these topics. We seek fierce
criticism, intense and beautiful imagery, and harsh but sincere
patriotism. We seek reflection, rage, despair and hope. We wish to think
about America in new, progressive, and productive ways, and will look
for artists and authors who can help us to do so, whether or not they've
ever actually been to America.

You can learn more about UnlikelyStories.org from our "regular"
submission guidelines at http://www.unlikelystories.org/mission.shtml .
Submissions to this special issue should be sent to Luis at
july4th@unlikelystories.org . **Submissions close on June 15th.** Please
send text submissions as .rtf attachments, visual submissions as .gif or
.jpgs, and query before sending files more than a megabyte. English and
Spanglish accepted. English-language submissions to un-themed issues of
Unlikely remain open.

Luis Cuauhtemoc Berriozabal is a prolific poet whose works appear widely

Hi all.=A0 I apologize if you are receiving this email in duplicate, as the=

I'm writing because a dear friend of mine and an exceptionally talented poe=
t,=A0Craig Arnold, whom some of you know, has gone missing on a small volca=
nic island in Japan while on a creative exchange fellowship.=A0 Craig, an e=
xperienced explorer of volcanoes, never returned to his inn after leaving a=
lone to research the island's active volcano for the afternoon.=A0 The auth=
orities are on the third day of searching for Craig, and are scouring the s=
mall island (of only 160 inhabitants) with dogs and helicopters.=A0 If he i=
s not found by the end of the day, the authorities will call off the search=
.

We need your help to insure that the search will continue.=A0 The island an=
d areas surrounding the volcano are small enough that an extended search wi=
ll surely lead to Craig's discovery.WE NEED PEOPLE TO CONTACT THEIR LOCAL C=
ONGRESSPEOPLE AND SENATORS TO PRESSURE THE JAPANESE STATE DEPARTMENT TO CON=
TINUE THE SEARCH.=A0 WE ALSO NEED HELP SPARKING MEDIA ATTENTION FOR THIS ST=
ORY, WHICH WE ALSO HOPE MIGHT INCREASE PRESSURE ON JAPANESE AUTHORITIES TO =
FIND CRAIG.=A0 I have attached a document with background information about=
 Craig, as well as information about the details leading up to his disappea=
rance as well as about the island itself.=A0 Please feel free to use this a=
s reference material.

If any of you have ideas or know people who might be able to help, we'd app=
reciate hearing from you.=A0 You can contact Rebecca Lindenberg, Craig's gi=
rlfriend, at rlindenberg@mac.com.=A0 Please, though, take a minute to conta=
ct your senator and congressperson via telephone or even email to explain t=
his problem and insist on their help.

We are so hoping to find Craig today, God-willing not seriously injured.=A0=
 If so, this will not be an issue, but we must ensure that if this isn't re=
solved today, Craig doesn't end up an unsolved mystery.=A0 He is too import=
ant to too many people, not to mention to arts and letter generally, for th=
is to happen.

We appreciate your help, good wishes and prayers.

MICHAEL DATCHER
Award winning Memoirist, Poet, Journalist & Critic


Saturday, May 9, 7:30pm at the Outpost Performance Space
210 Yale SE, Albuquerque=20

Michael Datcher is a poet and critically acclaimed journalist from Los =
Angeles and author of the New York Times Bestseller Raising Fences, his =
memoir about a black man's right to security, family and love. In this =
emotionally raw and intimate narrative, Datcher reflects on his =
fatherless childhood in inner-city Los Angeles, his attraction to local =
gangs, his promiscuity, and, at times, his lack of faith. The film =
rights for Raising Fences were optioned by actor Will Smith's Overbrook =
Productions, who hired Datcher to write the screenplay. Datcher is =
co-editor of Tough Love: The Life and Death of Tupac Shakur. His latest =
play Silence was commissioned by and premiered at the Getty Museum. He =
has appeared on both news programs Nightline and Dateline as an analyst =
and is a frequent commentator on BBC Radio. He is co-host of the weekly =
public affairs news magazine Beautiful Struggle on 90.7 FM KPFK. =
Datcher's writing has appeared in the Washington Post, LA Times, =
Baltimore Sun, The Source, Ladies Home Journal and Vibe among many other =
publications. He has curated and/or presented his work at the Brooklyn =
Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art, The Hammer Museum and other =
art institutions.

Local African American poets and spoken word artists will open up for =
Mr. Datcher, including Maisha Baton, Hakim Bellamy, Idris Goodwin and =
Gary Jackson. Virginia Hampton and Stephanie Willis (formerly of Out =
ch'Yonda) will perform a spoken word duet about Charles Mingus.=20

This event is in conjunction with West Southwest: ABQ-LA Exchange at 516 =
ARTS (April 4 - May 16, 2009), and is organized by Lisa Gill and Richard =
Vargas, 516 ARTS literary arts co-coordinators. A visual slideshow about =
this LA exchange project, composed by Bryan Konefsky of Basement Films, =
accompanies the featured poets.=20


TICKETS: $12 / $10 for students, members of 516 ARTS or Outpost, =
available from:

516 ARTS (505-242-1445, info@516arts.org) and Outpost Performance Space =

Charitable Foundation, the City of Albuquerque, New Mexico Forum for =
Youth & Community and the New Mexico Office of African American Affairs.
