DAYS OF RAGE is an audio performance for small audiences which combines
headphones, speakers and live piano. It follows several would-be
activists in present day New York as they try to orchestrate a
contemporary equivalent to the Weatherman's failed 1969 "Days of Rage"
Chicago riot. Strange and surreal, the narrative explores political
alienation, the ethics of violence, and the distance between the
sociopolitical climate of the sixties and today.

ROBERT QUILLEN CAMP creates interdisciplinary performance works that
combine sound, music, installation, and theater. His plays and playlike
texts have been published in Conjunctions, Chain, Play: A Journal of
Plays, Conundrum, and are forthcoming in Factorial. His performances
have been presented in New York (HERE American Living Room Festival,
Dixon Place, Little Theater, Columbia University, Bowery Poetry Club,

Contemporary Art), Philadelphia, PA (Temple University), Providence, RI
(Brown University New Plays Festival) and Portland, OR (The Constant
Theater). He is the founder and director of the Dodeska Performance
Ensemble ( http://www.dodeska.com ).

hear, hear, dodie! you expressed what's been on my mind for quite a while.
some of these top-down policies and decisions make me uneasy. to implement
them sets the list down the path to an unhealthy micromanaging.

I do not think the list supervisors should be making such editorial
decisions.  Either allow poems or ban them.  Don't decide some people are
worthy of filling our mailboxes and others aren't.

Also, I think some definition of poem needs to be agreed upon.  To make a
genre decision of post versus poem on an experimental poetry discussion
list is problematic.  It's a sort of genre policing that such a list, I
would imagine, should be geared towards subverting. It's not that I care to
be flooded with bad poetry, but these sorts of aesthetic decisions, as
Lawrence points up, are also political.

Best,
Dodie

Subject:      apoplexy
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

I'm writing this email and sending it out to a number of lists because I
think the issue of list governance is important; I now run three lists in
collaboration for example.

The Poetics list has increasingly not only eroded community, but also
created a canonic and rigid framework for what is and is not poetics - a
framework that excludes not only my own experimental work, for example,
but also Ishaq's politicized and rhetorical experimental/manifesto
approach.

This is done without any voting on the part of the list members, without
any discussion - it's the identical fiat used by Bush and company, presen-
ting the appearance of good governance, damning constituencies behind the
scenes.

And as with Bush and company, I don't see really any debate here - what
the moderators did, they did from on high, without explanation, or with
poor explanation. Unlike "my" lists which are responsive to community, the
Poetics list is responsive primarily to the moderators.

This is ugly.

There _are_ lists that are open for discussion and presentation - again I
mention wryting, also Imitationpoetics (whose title now appears the other
way around) - for anyone truly experimenting with poetics and new media,
there is the webartery list as well. What's depressing is that the Poetics
list was once a community, once edgy, and now that's permanently gone.

It's been ordered so by the bureaucrats - for what could be more bureau-
cratic than to increasingly turn a community towards announcements, and
discussions, but beware of the _originary material_ of such discussions?

Meanwhile the list veers more and more towards memorials for Creeley,
Ginsberg, god knows who else, as if a list on contemporary aesthetics
should bemoan what, Judd's death? Warhol?

Times move on but this list ossifies - and this is a real and political
danger, I believe; it reinforces notions of what is and is not acceptable,
it promulgates the canonic - and this is nowhere so clear as in the
censoring of Ishaq - for shame! - it reifies the academy (just look at the
'officiating' titles of some of the blog entries around here). I can't
imagine Whitman, Rimbaud, Lautreamont, participating here; unfortunately I
_can_ imagine the right-winged Eliot having a ball.

Along the same lines there are almost _no_ discussions of _contemporary_
poetics - for example computer aesthetics, the sorts of things Florian
Cramer, Funkhauser, Sandy Baldwin, mez, Talan Memmott, Nick Montfort, Jim
Rosenberg, etc. write about. Where is codework? Where is jodi? Where is a
discuss of hackerz or warez? Where is Eugene Thacker, Kenji Siratori?
Solipsis? Noemata? Meskens? l_oy? Where are presentations of this
material? The world of poetry/poetics is changing - and the only sign I
see here and in general is the continual claims of language poetry to have
been there at the foundations of new media poetics.

Which just isn't true - if you look at the early work reflected say in the
Software Catalog or my 1971 pieces or even some of early Acconci. But just
as with Bush and associates, not only does this list mourn and mourn, but
it also creates false histories, measured statements, etc.

This list, with its increased closures, in fact is increasingly doing
culture a disservice - as if poetry/poetics/whatthefuck were something
one can conveniently legislate, a world of gentleman and gentlewoman
writers. And none of this would matter, except that this list already has,
not only a large subscriber list, but the ability to weild a great deal of
power, in terms of publications, grants, academic and other positions. It
protects itself, just as the writers protect themselves, tuning me and
others out, censoring any creative work qua creative work, because after
all poetics turns on itself and elsewhere publication, and this is a list
for the pure.

Where is Kent Johnson? From the Poetics viewpoint, perhaps all of us
should throw ourselves out the collective window, as Zero Mostel did last
night in a rerun of The Front on TCM. Because things sure aren't going to
change around here, and language poetry, basking in academic spotlights,
will petrify literary culture until it becomes another Pound/Eliot/
monument memorial in someone else's Inbox.

I recognize that I am probably way off-target here, but there are very few
places like Poetics used to be, and its free-wheeling nature was a god-
send. If one wants to post readings/publications/etc. there are a _lot_ of
other ways to handle it - for example nettime announcements, which
parallels and accompanies nettime, or the Franklin Furnace goings on list.
But that won't do here - instead everyone has to be controlled, and as the
letter to me showed - since it was sent back-channel - controlled from
behind the scenes. The same goes for Ishaq (who I respect but obviously
don't like - he's been far too nasty to me personally) - who, as much as
any of us, has been contributing to what constitutes writing/wryting at
the beginning of the 21st century. And his is a voice that _needs_ to be
heard, dealing with _contemporary_ issues, rather than whether Ginsberg is
misogynist or not for gods sake. Or at least to be heard _as much as the
latter._

I'm sending this out everywhere, since I'm not sure the moderators will
let it through. Or else they will, in a show of kindly and superior
liberality. But at least it will be elsewhere on the Net.

And I do apologize if I've misread anything, btw. This is not a flame but
a complaynte in a country at war both inside and out.

Hi Poetics,

I’m moving to Denver late this summer and hope that someone might be able to
offer some suggestions or ins with locating an adjunct gig or two. I ask
here in public because it's my experience that things can be somewhat cloak
& dagger in adjunct world, as the courses I've been doing for the last year
were landed via word of mouth. But I'm really looking for anything. I've
been teaching for five years now, both as a grad student and an adjunct
instructor, but have also (and would be willing to) painted houses, slung
books, etc. Thanks. B/C Please…

Well, there are things that tend that way, but it is more complicated
than
that. When California enacted anti-Black laws in the 1850s, the Governor
in Victoria (who was partly African) welcomed African-Americans who
were escaping the USA.

Monday, May 23rd, 2005 7pm: (Victoria Day)
1) Steve Dalachinsky (poet) - Steven Dalachinsky born in brooklyn after
the last big war has survived many little wars. Dalachinsky's work
appears regularly in journals on and off line. His most recent books
include: Trial and Error in Paris (Loudmouth Collective Press); In
Glorious Black and White (Ugly Duckling Press); Poems For Lautreamont
(Furniture Press) and the soon to be released Trust Fund Babies
(Pitchfork Press). He has been anthologized through the years in such
books as Beat Indeed, Haiku Moment and the much praised anthology The
Outlaw Bible of American Poetry. He is he hopes, Steven Dalachinsky and
no one else —tho that is doubtful.

*

2) George Wallace (poet) - George Wallace (poet) - George Wallace is
editor of Poetrybay (www.poetrybay.com), Polarity (www.poembeat.com) and
Long Island Quarterly. He is co-host of poetrybrook usa (www.wusb.org).
He's been published in Hunger, Milk Magazine, Long Shot, Home Planet
News, Cafe Review, Jacket, bigcitylit, Brooklyn LitKicks, Big Bridge and
Jack Magazine. His poem 'incident in a rose garden' appeared in about.com
and Poets Against the War. He regularly performs his poetry with David
Amram and other jazz artists, and has had recent local appearances in
Woodstock, Hunter, Rensselairville, and Preston Hollow. Wallace tours
Europe frequently, and nationally he has read his work from San Francisco
Ca to Lowell Ma, from Orlando Fl to Brunswick Me, and from Oklahoma City
OK to Battle Creek Mi. He appears at such New York City venues as Bowery
Poetry Club, Back Fence, Cornelia Street Cafe, and Sidewalk Cafe. His
most recent books of poetry are 'swimming through water' (La Finestra
Editrice, It, 2003) and Greatest Hits (Puddinghouse Press, USA, 2003).
Forthcoming is 'burn my heart in wet sand' (Troubador Books, UK 2004).
Critic Hugh Fox says, "No one writes...more penetratingly directly, right
into the heart of your soul, than George Wallace." Charles Plymell
describes Wallace as "a Max Ernst stuck on the elevator of up and down
history."  Neeli Cherkovski calls his work "Quite simply beautiful."
Mario Petrucci calls him "a gutsy inventor, up half the night hammering
out his word-proliferations to just the right side of prolix, brimming
his associative word-capacitors with unconscious charges and beneficent
volts." And Wayne Atherton, of Cafe Review, says Wallace's "poems course
through him, transformed into densely structured, complex and original
poems unselfconsciously surreal."

Nick, you have accurately described the relative importance of the poet =
as person in relationship to the poet's writings, and yet, it seems to =
me there's a point you might have missed, the non-academic element of =
the discussion of poems versus the discussion of poets. =20

How the poet lived and who the poet was in her or his time is relevant =
information only to the extent that academics have an interest in =
underscoring  the motives and incentives that speculatively may or may =
not have influenced the artist...too, there's the whole academic thesis =
thing in which the author/ress makes some attempt to have mastered the =
life and times of "Person A," the artist, or the era of Person A, in =
order to complete the upper degree when the thesis or dissertation is =
approved/accepted.  And all of this discussion and related writing =
advances academia, but does in truth little to improve the knowledge or =
appreciation of the works of the artist. =20

And there's this aspect, often overlooked.  The critical examination of =
and emphasis on a particular artist by members of the academic community =
lend a degree of credibility (because the population in general holds =
the academic community in esteem) to the works and the writer (Poet).  =
And that academic credibility adds to the longevity of the artist's =
works.  The more emphasis the academics place on the works and life of a =
poet, the more "influential" or "important" that writer is determined to =
be.=20

And yet, one wonders...

Here's a short piece:

            Ghosts
"One need not be a chamber to be haunted,=20
One need not be a house;
The brain has corridors surpassing
Material place.=20
...
Far safer through an Abbey gallop
The stones achase,
Than, moonless, one's own self encounter
In lonesome place."=20
                        ...Emily Dickinson=20

From reading this piece, I've heard academics carry on for hours about =
the lonely aspects of the poet's lifestyle and how that lifestyle =
influenced the poet's works. (Such assertions may be accurate; they are =
at best, speculative guesses regarding the actual influence.)=20

But I've also heard from non-students and non-language majors who were =
not familiar with the poet's life style.  These folks had a different =
appreciation of the poem. They admire the simplicity of the imagery, and =
the internal awareness the writer must have had in coming to grips with =
being alone...there's also a general acceptance by readers unaware of =
E.D's life that loneliness and coping with facing ones true self is =
something one might experience while in a crowd and while living in a =
crowded place. =20

I have shared this piece with scores of folks both in and out of the =
classroom over the past many decades and I've observed two things:

1. One need never ever have heard of Emily Dickinson to appreciate the =
poem's subtleties.

2. Those who know of Emily Dickinson's life style see the poet's =
lifestyle in the work and seem to be far more interested in the find of =
Freudian dissection of the poem than in the marvelous and simple imagery =
the poet has drawn.=20

Indeed, the questions are not, was the poet a social misfit (in any =
sense of the word) a loner, alone and lonely and afraid to encounter =
herself, and did the poet's lifestyle affect the poet's works? =20

Rather, the question is: is the work memorable?  Will future readers =
appreciate the imagery and ponder any questions the work raises, =
irrespective of why the poet raises them?=20

So...do we care who Ginsberg was?  Or do we care more about works he has =
left behind for us to appreciate, despite or as a result of how the man =
lived and who he was socially? (sorry, I can't post an A.G. simple, =
short piece to underscore my point here...the lad seldom wrote simple =
and short memorable pieces...at least none with which I'm familiar.)

While I have been amused at some of the things I've read about A.G.'s =
life and lifestyle, I'm of the view that his works (at least a few of =
them) will long outlast the rumors of any of his misbehaviors.  A.G.'s =
work stands on it's merits as art...some of which I rather like, some of =
which I find quite ordinary.=20


Let's raise these questions: Do academic studies harm the process of =
poetic creation?  Might we have more poets in the world had we fewer =
professors of poetry?  Is poetry a subject to be studied or a craft to =
be learned and practiced as that of woodworking or masonry? Has academia =
diminished the practice  and the art of poetry by over-emphasizing the =
technical constructs aspect of writing poetry?=20

  This is a worthy idea and suggestion, but I'm not sure I completely =
agree
  with this in practical terms. Maybe Mary Jo Malo is thinking mainly of
  recent and contemporary poets. Obviously, over time,  poets' works and =
lives
  are interwoven in the public imagination, and are occasionally seen =
together
  as representative of an era and even have been claimed by some to =
usher in
  an artistic era. In this case, the "humanity" of the poet is looked at
  closely. Think of Mallarme in this light; few ardent readers have not =
read
  about and visualized his famous "Tuesday night" soirees, attended by =
such
  luminaries as Debussy. Mallarme and Baudelaire's interest in the =
visual arts
  have been a great influence on countless subsequent poets. A =
fascinating
  example of this tendency are the oft-cited discussions of Walter =
Benjamin on
  Baudelaire. Baudelaire's way of handling his poverty, and the fact =
that his
  poetry remained largely unrecognized in his lifetime helped to create =
the
  very concept of the "bohemian" lifestyle. Think of how Emily Dickinson =
and
  Gertrude Stein are depicted not only in the light of their works, but =
their
  lives. The "imperfections" of an artist's life might later be
  seen as an opening for liberating possibilities for the lifestyles of
  countless others. My favorite book on this is Shattuck's *The Banquet
  Years.* Despite the earnest and sincere efforts on the part of many =
critics
  and theorists to separate poets' lives from their works, readers of =
poetry
  and people on the whole generally connect the two. Who hasn't thought
  about the implication of Kafka asking, before he died, that his =
writing
  be destroyed by his best friend, who, thankfully, disregarded this?
  There are so many examples of such anecdotes that shape the
  way we regard a writer's works.

Dear list:

Since we've found that soliciting poems from a couple of the list's
subscribers has created some confusion and misunderstanding, and since
Mary Jo Malo has so generously set up "Company of Poets" as a way, in
part, to compensate for the limits of the Poetics List, we would like
to now focus the list even more on discussion and announcements and so
we will no longer solicit poems to be posted on the list.

This is also a good time to reiterate a couple of our policies:

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We
define 'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or
personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not (and including the list
editors). The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space
for discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not
follow listserv policy on flaming will be removed from the
subscription roll.

Private correspondence should not be published on the Poetics List
without the permission of the author.

You can review the full welcome message at:

it has come to my attention that alan sondheim's very eloquent
commentary re the poems or no poems dilemma, "apoplexy", has very
likely been censored from the list. i read it on WRYTING and will
gladly pass it on to anyone on Poetics who has not received it.

as a friend of alan's, a fan of his work, and an avid reader of
Poetics, i am upset and confused.

WORKSHOPS

THE WORKING WRITER SEMINAR, with Kathryn Radeff

How to Write A Book Proposal
Saturday, May 7
Single Saturday Session: $50, $40 for members

Mini workshops are fun, fast-paced, informational and inspirational. In an
easy-to-understand manner, the sessions present the fundamentals of creative
writing as they apply to fact-based articles and personal experience, as
well as the craft of fiction. Lectures and writing exercises, which are used
to illustrate the concepts, are aimed at developing the writers'
understanding of structure, description, dialogue, character, style and
voice. Workshops also cover the art of writing query letters, research and
interviewing techniques, manuscript preparation and submission strategies.
Ideal for the beginner and skilled writer, mini-day workshops provide an
excellent overview of their fields. The goal is to have an article or short
story well underway by the time the session ends. An extensive analysis of
one completed piece is included. There will be one 30-minute break. The
workshop includes a question and answer session.

Required Course Book/Workbook ($13): You Can Be A Working Writer by Kathryn
Radeff Payable to the instructor

POEM = SOUND = BODY, with Marj Hahne
Saturday, May 14, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 members

Ezra Pound said that poetry begins to atrophy when it departs too far from
music, and music begins to atrophy when it departs too far from the dance.
How do we source our poems from our own body's rhythms, so that our poems
are bodies of sound-sound bodies-durable because they are built from the
language's meaning and music? Memorable poems are often those that get
inside and move both our brain (what's said is heard) and our body (what's
unsaid is felt). In this workshop, for beginning and practiced poets, we
will generate lots of new writing while attending to sound, with sample
poems selected for their musicality.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson Literary
Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the Arts, Mad
Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled notspeak.

Nick:

Biography is literature, not life, and depends as much on the skill of =
the biographer as the value of the anecdotal material. Ultimately, =
however, a writer's life is measured by the quality of the work. Of =
course the work stems from a life, and I'd be the first to advocate =
living an "original," life, whether exterior or interior. There are =
people who are remembered only for their life. But they are not artists, =
or scientists, they are personalities. Take Einstein: his life is of =
interest only because his work shook the world.

The idea of computer games as art is one which has primarily been toyed
with by many folks. Executed seldomly. If you have a fairly recent
computer, I recommend picking up Doom 3.

It's 'an experience'.  For instance, when you eventually find yourself
in Hell, you do tremble a bit, though it be over bits and bytes. The
atmospheres of the audio are amazing. "Cinematic", as in the best of sci-fi
thrillers. The graphics are tasty. The individual demons are pretty good,
but it's the art of the worlds created that are most memorable. Particularly
the scenes outside in the Martian military-industrial landscape. And Hell,
as noted, is to tremble in. And the archeological dig in the bowels of Mars
has some awesome scenes.

Of course, most everything about this game is 'killer'. It borders on a
'visceral' experience. It is a 're-telling' of the original Doom story--but
the original Doom story was hardly told. It was all shown. Lots of
inferences to make. In Doom 3, there is much more narrative matter. Such as
the cinematic scenes where characters speak and the interactivity is
suspended briefly. In these scenes, we hear and see a handful of characters
much as in a film.

Also, we occassionally pick up some unfortunate corpse's PDA, and their info
is added to our own PDA. We then can read their email and listen to audio
logs. Their email sometimes has numeric codes in it that lets us pick up
medicine, weapons, and other tokens. But often it doesn't, and is strictly
narrative. I usually scan this for numeric codes, mostly, rather than read
it carefully, but it's well-done enough that you do end up reading some of
it mildly attentively. Not sure how it compares with how we deal with email.
Sometimes we also encounter video disks that we can play in our PDA; usually
these are propaganda from the UAC, the evil corporation. These video disks
also sometimes detail the research of the scientists into the
intriguing civilizations, artifacts, weapons, and creatures they
have encountered.

Still, the story and characters and narrative are, well, for kids.  This is
not a fine drama. Some of the Alien movies do provide a sense of drama in
the relationships between people and how those are handled. Doom 3 is 'Grand
Guignol': "As used today, the term 'Grand Guignol' (pronounced Grahn
Geen-yol') refers to any dramatic entertainment that deals with macabre
subject matter and features "over-the-top" graphic violence" (from
grandguignol.com).

The basic premise of Doom 3 is that scientists working on a Martian military
base run by the UAC corporation have created technology that transports
demons (and people) back and forth between Mars and Hell. And of
course it gets a little out of hand. But wait; have I got that right?
Revisiting this writing a couple more days into the playing, I find myself
in the bowels of Mars at an archeological site where the researchers have
unearthed (or demarsed?) an ancient civilization that apparently battled
the same 'forces of evil' that we are pitted against. The ancient
civilization appears to be human, our ancestors. Um OK, but what about
the critters? Are they still from Hell? Or are they terrestrial also?
I'm not sure yet. I doubt this will be resolved in the game, actually.
Oh they're just from Hell, right? From the scariest place imaginable.
But wouldn't that be, like, the Pentagon or something? Ah, that'd be
another horror story.

It's over the top and plays well into the 'grand guignol'. But we note
The Divine Comedy involves trips through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven.
I haven't finished Doom 3 yet, but I don't expect a tour through heaven,
somehow. But their Hell is entirely memorable.

Also, the experience of not only Hell but heights, for instance, is
fantastic. In one scene in the bowels of Mars, you climb a crane and
dangle precariously from well-rendered heights. Those who are afraid
of heights may find this liberating. Or terrifying, as the case may
be. But it is certainly an experience. And an experience you may
enjoy all the more for it not actually posing the terrestrial dangers
we normally associate with heights.

While the story is mostly for kids, so too could this be said of Homer's
work. And there are other works of literature such as Eugene Onegin by
Pushkin where the story is fairly simple. Eugene Onegin is often cited as
the first Russian novel. Though, actually, it's written in poetry and the
poetry is divine. The long poem never developed the sort of psychological
and realistic narrative complexity we associate with the novel. Long poems
can be very complex in certain ways, but narratively is almost never one of
them. Why? Because that sort of complexity seems to involve the prosaic more
than is good for a long poem. Or more than has been ventured successfully,
perhaps, is all.

Still, though, we can imagine computer games that have dramatic depth and
significance beyond stuff for kids. It's mostly the market, I think, that
makes Doom 3's story for kids, not the form.

And then there are the political dimensions of Doom 3. The story is very
military-oriented, and the human characters all are either marines or
military researchers who work for a big corporation. Lots of torture,
intentional and not. Quite different from Abu Graib, but the associations
are currently inescapable. Cowboy capitalism heavily involved in the
military and technology. And Hell. Of course Id software is from Texas.

I don't think there's any getting around the feeling that Doom 3 is a bit of
a masterpiece as a computer game. It's great that they actually believed
enough in Doom to do it again in Doom 3. It isn't a 'sequel' in the usual
sense. It's a re-doing. And as much attention has been placed on excavating
the narrative as improving the graphics and sound.

The feeling I get is not that it is disgusting and base, politically
inexcusable, and a disgrace to digital art. They go so far into the
shoot-em-up that they come out the other side, in territory not unrelated to
The Inferno and Alien. The violence is implicitly cosmic or psychic as in
the best of thriller sci-fi. And of course it is also the violence of 3.2
GHz of interactive multimedia processing.

It is evidently still quite early. In terms both of dramatic form and
processing. But if this isn't art I'll eat my shorts. This work is such
a strong experience that we see much better how interactive games and
cinema can be fused into compelling art.

ps: http://www.visualwalkthroughs.com/doom3/doom3.htm links at the
bottom to a walkthrough of the game, and http://doom3.com is the
id site. Though if you want to play the game, probably best not
to dive too deep into the walkthrough; it'd just take a bit of
the wonder off the initial experience. But each to her own.

If you Google Doom 3 you see lots of stuff.

Very good point. For example, A. Sondheim is I assume the most avid poster to the list. In his case, commentary and performance are one. The same is true of Nudel.

Some of the best posts were performances, for instance, those by the mad singer from New Zealand (?), who has been silent for a while; or PatricK Herron, his bursts of poignant commentary in any direction his mind took him. Those were the voices who stirred the most resonant arguments in poetry.

If you care, you curse. If it were to me- I would invite even Kent Johnson and Henry Gould back the the fold. I miss the vicious arguments about something important.

The question of existence and uniqueness of a poem is equivalent to asking
for the number of lines of the poem or for the number of intersections.
Over the full range of their arguments, poem one, poem two are very
complicated non-linear functions and therefore we should not be surprised
if in certain cases no, or maybe several, lines for different pairs title
one, title two, exist. General statements concerning this global behaviour
of poem one, poem two are certaintly not easy to obtain.

The prospects are much more favourable if we restrict ourselves to the
simpler question of a local uniqueness in the following sense. ... If
feeling G not equal to zero then we have only the trivial poem, i.e., no
other poem exists within the infinitesimal neighbourhood of the given one.
... If the feeling G vanishes, non-vanishing is possible and we have
neighbouring poems. Then local uniqueness is violated.

Joel,

Thanks very much for your response.

For me, "biography" or published biographies do not represent the totality
of the continued cultural presence of anyone, particularly their crucial
cultural "imago," least of all that of a poet. There was a life lived; it is
experienced and remembered in certain ways; there were words written, and
things said; these are initially experienced in a cultural context and then
recorded and remembered in certain ways.  Most people who become fascinated
with a book or a movie eventually want to know everything they can learn
about the person who wrote the book or made the movie. This is because the
movie has caused them to think about the experience we call "life."
Countless memoirs and biographies continue to appear about Sylvia Plath, for
example. Most of her readers do not content themselves with rereading her
poems. They want to know more. A better example might be the record made of
the life of Wallace Stevens, "Parts of a World Remembered", where nearly
every living person who knew Wallace Stevens at all was interviewed. Paul
Celan's poetry is loved,  treasured even, but the reality of his cultural
presence evolved not only from the publication of the poems themselves.
These reflected things thought and spoken by an actual living person. Celan
is a "character" is the ongoing cinema we call "real life." Joel Weishaus'
statement, for me, somewhat discounts this aspect of dream in so-called
"real life." There are no such sharp distinctions in  the life of art, in
either its creation or its reception. Check out  D.A. Levy's *Translating
Tradition* concerning Paul Celan, for example. The cultural role of Celan
grows more complex and interwoven with the lives of countless
people each and every day. This isn't only because of the poems.
Pavese is another great example. Poet suicides go to the heart
of the issue we are discussing here. Their final acts are just as much
a "statement" as anything that was written or said by them.
Their works and their lives constitute a total "statement." We
don't just read, we feel, we empathize, we have antipathies,
we react, we identify. Writing and reading poetry, or any literature,
or significantly experiencing any work of art, is also partly
an adventure in personal insight and transformation. It is utterly
"personal", even when contemporary life at the moment is less and less so.
Poetry and poets and all artists struggle to enliven the personal,
individual aspect of living. I  would imagine at one time people talked
about poetry- even here on the list the still do sometimes- the way now
almost everyone talks about movies, movie actors, directors, etc. *Blade
Runner* is a cultural touchstone in every detail now. Book after
book keeps appearing offering more and more information, opinion
and insight. At one time the same thing happened with Byron.
Such discussion is not just for the purpose of intellectual
understanding. It is part and parcel of cultural experience,
in the sense that culture is a work in process, wherein artistic
works and lives are interventions in the process, interventions
towards change, nor "progress" but mutative transformation.
Andy Warhol played off these blurry boundaries between art
and life more or less constantly. He carried a tape recorder
around he called his companion and published he diaries
and journals even though he was mainly a visual artist. He did
this with humor and irony; nevertheless the presence of living
people was crucial; out of this he created his films in which his
"stars" were very deliberately people in the act of living their lives,
also trying to become *stars* themselves. OK, they were underpaid
but that's another story.

The Dada poets, and in a more diluted way, the surrealists
were out to make just this point. But in a literary culture obsessed
with critique and evaluation of a poet's book's "greatness", it is only the
actual product that counts, not the person who creates it. In art the story
is different; everything counts.

Dear Editors,

With regard to your recent decision that poems will not longer be allowed =
on the Poetics List, I realize you do not intend to address this matter =
further but I have a question.  How will you know it's a poem and is there =
an honor code? =20

For years I have been trying to free myself of conversation in favor of =
conversing only in poetry.  I have made major strides towards this goal.  =
I feel success is within my grasp.  The answer is not to import found =
language into poetry but to send poetry out into everyday discourse like =
so many platelets or Frisbees or oases of calm government.  To that end I =
have produced thousands of poems.  I am close to having at least one for =
every eventuality.  They can be quite subtle.  Almost indistinguishable =
from real conversation (to me of course they are much realer than =
conversation, hence my endeavors to begin with). =20

How will you know if my messages are poems?  How will you know they are =
not poems?  Do you want me to self-declare?  Do you want me to throw away =
years of work and start ham-fistedly attempting to communicate "normally" =
again? =20

What is the power of *about*?  Why is it alright to talk *about* poetry =
but not alright to talk poetry?  How will you know?  What will you do? =20

Are there grey areas?  Will you notice if too much attention is paid to =
spacing or a bit of alliteration creeps in?  Even avoiding the obvious, =
what if a piece has all the devil-may-care casualness of prose but the =
bold gestalt heart of pure poetry?  Even impure.  Is your rule enforceable?=
  Why would you want it to be? =20

I will sign this so you know it's not a poem.  Next time I may be =
trickier.  Or maybe I'm being really tricky now.

Oh goodness.  Here's to Mairead and her experiments in
deception.  But "fascismo di arte?"  C'mon.
Seriously.

You're just lucky *I'm* not moderating this list!
Hahah.  Now that would be despotism...

Let's just end this strain of thought and move on to
some serious talk.  On poetics.

With all due respect for the folks - all poets - who try to manage a list of
poets, it's hard to know if this list is walking on eggs (a rebirth) or on a
corpse of its future self.
I suspect - regardless of the occasionally unfortunate, particularly vicious
personal attacks - many, if not most of us are wary of interventions that
close down the boundaries of the use of language (be it poetry, aesthetic
criticism, or political). We currently live in a larger system in which the
communications (aka language) are increasingly owned and controlled by the
Bush right. Public discourse is very much under Gov attack and there is an
increasing sense of imaginative desperation in terms of how to rip open the
envelope within which we find ourselves claustrophobically enclosed. Today's
stories on the control and direction of PBS is a ready immediate example -
if NPR is not already enough. And (below) tonight's release - at least in
England - of the uncensored Italian and American report on the shooting of
the Italian agent and reporter make it dramatically that our embedded Press
and Government have not told the truth at all about the magnitude of the
insurgency in Iraq. Under the pseudo-veil of democratic rhetoric, this
invasion and occupation becomes more clearly a colossal failure of vision.

In view of all these events - to take this back to "here" - the visceral
seeming refusal of many here to bow down to the restriction of list content
seems to me quite understandable. So I would encourage folks (the
leadership) to keep things open ended. Or end it!

And three cheers for the Italian "computer specialist" who broke the
censor's code.

Bomb attacks on the rise as 'New Baath party' is born

By Patrick Cockburn in Baghdad

03 May 2005

...The scale of the continuing violence in Iraq over the past year was
underlined by a US report on the 4 March shooting by American troops of
Italian security agent Nicola Calipari, the rescuer of the journalist
Giuliana Sgrena who had been held hostage.

It also reveals there were 15,527 attacks on coalition forces, largely
American, from July 2004 to late March 2005. Some 2,404 attacks took place
in Baghdad from 1 November to 12 March.

The report was first issued by the US in a heavily censored form with
sensitive information blocked out. But an Italian computer specialist
discovered that the censorship was easy to remove.

The picture painted by the uncensored military report is in sharp contrast
to the more optimistic views given by the Pentagon to the US media.

The bombings in the past week underline that the insurgents have lost none
of their ability to carry out attacks, almost always without regard for
civilian casualties, all over Iraq. In the three months since the elections
on 30 January there was a drop in American losses which led to official
optimism that the guerrilla war was on the wane.

There has been an increase in the number of assassination attempts against
Iraqi senior security officers based on precise intelligence about their
movements. A bomb yesterday slightly wounded Major-General Fuleih Rasheed,
the commander of a police commando unit linked to the interior ministry, and
two of his men in the Huriya district of northwest Baghdad. The bomb
exploded as Maj-Gen Rasheed's convoy raced past the point.

Thanks for the article, Stephen. Very much agree with your and most of the
other comments posted on the no-poetry issue. I read very little poetry from
the list, but see no reason it should not persist. Perhaps what we're seeing
is the winding down of Poetics? That would be a loss.

At any rate, the report, apparently put up by an Italian blogger, can be
downloaded here:

with storage costs

Alan,
I don't do windows, so my wife is always looking for a sensitive, caring =
window washer, one who will not tromp carelessly on her delicate plants =
like the Alpine strawberry just outside the dining room windows. =20

Of course, we pay scale; it's a short term assignment; we might be =
willing to trade poems for window panes, or should that be pains? ...but =
that remains to be discussed.=20

Don't know how much that will help, but remember, we're here if you need =
us...free tuna sandwiches for a reasonable period, and a great deal of =
admiration and respect...though that doesn't fill an empty stomach.

Pity about the poetry, but then...how much better off we all are on the =
list not having to read some of the stuff that has been posted.  OOOOPs, =
that appears somewhat judgmental...sorry.

Enjoy CA

Return when you can.=20

It's true that zealots assume that the reason to start a group is to
exclude people, because zealots aren't interested in pursuing either
the facts or the truth.

sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or

whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed

One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Since out launch on January 1, we have added many new files, and continue
to do so on a weekly basis. We are developing a fully functioning catalog,
but this will take at least one more year. We are also beginning to create
links to author sound files from EPC author pages. In the meantime, we have
installed a quick search feature, which, combined with our "singles" index,
will help to locate most of our files.

http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/

Recent additions to our "featured authors" include a selected poems of John
Wieners and  Fanny Howe, and readings by Lyn Hejinian, Adrienne Rich,
Barrett Watten, Norman Fischer, Robert Creeley, Myung Mi Kim, and talks by
Ron Silliman and Leevhi Lehto.

On our "Series" pages, in addition to the new Studio 111 shows, we have
added "Poetic Brooklyn," produced by Susan Brennan, which features readings
by Anja Mutic, Matvei Yankelevich, Arielle Greenberg, Vijay Sheshadri,
Julien Poirier, and  Filip Marinovic.

Also at "series", we have added a new season of Cross Cultural Poetics,
Leonard Schwartz's radio interviews/readings. New programs feature Robin
Blaser, Meredeith Quartermain, and Peter Quatermain, from Vancouver;
Richard Seiburth, who talks about, and reads from, his extraordinary
translation of Buchner's Lenz; and  John Taggart on "Peace on Earth". Other
programs feature Trevor Joyce, Khaled Mattawa, Rodrigo Toscano, Charles
Borkhuis, Russell Banks, Joseph Donahue, Albert Mobillio, John O'Leary,
Wang Ping Stacy Doris, Ed Foster, Nada Gorden, Maxine Chernoff, Rita Wong,
Wang Ping, Mark Wallace, and more.

We have also just launched PennSound/Classics, with readings of Pope and
Swift by John Richetti and David Wallace reading Chaucer.

I also want to recommend a marvellous Rockdrill CD series of selected
poems, from Birkbeck (UK)
*Robert Creeley: 'I Know a Man', poems 1945-1975
* Robert Creeley: 'Just in Time', poems 1976-1998
* Lee Harwood: 'The Chart Table', poems 1965-2002
* Tom Raworth: 'Ace', poems 1966-1979
* Tom Raworth: 'Writing', poems 1980-2003
* Jerome Rothenberg: 'Sightings', poems 1960-1983
* Jerome Rothenberg: 'Seedings', poems 1984-2003
You can order these from Carcanet's web site:
go to http://www.carcanet.co.uk/search2.html
and put "rockdrill" in the title box

Is there now a ONE msg per day rule, introduced
STEALTHILY, or is this a misunderstanding of Alan's?
If it not a misunderstanding, it is a particulately
unfortunate rule since the restriction to 2 messages a
day may have been a major factor in tamping down a lot
of the conversational energy of this list (along with
the rise of blogging, and whatever else might be a
factor).  As the Board will know I have suggested
privately that they experiment with allowing three
posts a day, then see if they want to stay with that,
go back to two, or experiment with four.  They have
not answered this or other arguments I addressed to
them.

Best,

I don't think anyone epitomizes Mairead's proposition more than  Dalachinsky,
and he's obvious, not devious about it. In fact, if you try to  engage him in
conversational e-mail, his words are almost non-existent,  minimalist poetry.
By limiting our posts to one per day and restricting  the format primarily to
announcements and discussion, we have an unusual  opportunity to do more than
just complain. Although, if we're creative enough it  may sound like
dialectic.

I've had the joy of reading prose that reads like poetry and poetry that
reads like prose. I prefer the former. And of course, there's that in between
thing, prosody? I think Lautreamont is known for his attempts, but I'm not sure.
 Pound too?

The topic of an author's life being inseparable from his work and his  affect
on his culture and future generations is very interesting. If you think
about or imagine what it would be like if we were such great influences, how
would we live our lives? Were the great ones aware of their impact, and how did
it affect their personal lives and their writing? Did they feel pretentious,
authentic or responsible?

Wondering,

Dear Editors,

This is a true letter to the editor because I have a strong sense I will =
get no reply.  Obviously I think it too bad that you wish to exclude =
poetry from the Poetics list.  That leaves announcements and discussion -- =
but you don't engage in discussion, and you even state below your =
intention not to engage in discussion on this matter.  That leaves =
announcements.  Why is having the Poetics list as a bulletin board =
preferable to having it studded with poems by Alan, or anyone?  Why don't =
you guys engage in discussion?  Why do you wish to exclude poems?  My =
respect for you indicates to me that you must have good reasons, but I =
don't know what they are, nor why you will not elucidate or participate in =
conversation, or even why I am in the position of writing expecting no =
reply.  It's no fun.

Dear list:

Since we've found that soliciting poems from a couple of the list's
subscribers has created some confusion and misunderstanding, and since
Mary Jo Malo has so generously set up "Company of Poets" as a way, in
part, to compensate for the limits of the Poetics List, we would like
to now focus the list even more on discussion and announcements and so
we will no longer solicit poems to be posted on the list.

This is also a good time to reiterate a couple of our policies:

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We
define 'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or
personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not (and including the list
editors). The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space
for discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not
follow listserv policy on flaming will be removed from the
subscription roll.

Private correspondence should not be published on the Poetics List
without the permission of the author.

Please note that we do not plan to address these matters further.

Poetics List policy is not, and would never be, against using any form,
including poetry, as part of list discussion. The key is that we are
asking for posts that are "directed toward a discussion of poetics
issues on the list."

Open mike readings, unedited web poetry forums, lists that have open
calls for posting poems, and smaller community-building writing exchange
forums and blogs abound. The value of the Poetics List is different,
though it is certainly useful in providing information about such sites
as well as the publications and recommendations, web and print and blog,
of its subscribers.

Here is the relevant section of the Welcome Messagw (please review the
entire current Welcome Message at
http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html)

2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message.

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions
of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. We strongly
encourage subscribers to post information, including web links, relating
to publications (print and internet), reading series, and blogs that
they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear. Such
announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not directed toward a
discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is not a
venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or journal entries.

Tonight at the Solstice Cafe in Victoria, BC, at 7:30 pm, I'm reading along
with locals Joshua James and Matt Bigelow. This is just one stop of about 20
that I'm making on a cross-continental tour to promote my new book The
Worthwhile Flux. I'm pointing out this one especially for the benefit of
Lawrence Braithwaite. Lawrence, if you're in town and can come to the show,
I'd love to meet you.

On Thursday I'll be in Vancouver at the Helen Pitt Gallery, joined by Anne
Stone and Wayde Compton.

I think the list owners have made it pretty clear that
poetry is NOT excluded from the list. The question "Is
it poetry or is it a post" is also moot, as poetic
responses to issues of poetics are welcomed, just as,
I presume, poems that are accompanied by questions or
comments about poetics are welcomed. I'm sure that
they realize that all poems engage issues of poetics
in some fashion, by embracing or rejecting a given set
of aesthetic values. However, they're looking for
posts that explicitly engage poetics (this is the
poetics list, right?), and if the poems do not
directly and explicitly engage issues of poetics--or
if you feel that your poem might be misread as not
explicitly engaging issues of poetics, then, again,
you might append a discussion of the poetic issues
your poem engages with, with the aim of provoking
productive conversation (in poetry or prose) about
those issues.

For example, were Perelman to have just written "On
the Marginalization of Poetry," I'm sure the poetics
list would be a fine forum for it (even though,
ostensibly, it's poetry).

And since we have only one post per day, I'll append
my question to this email: What criticisms and/or
extensions would you make to this list, which is
designed to characterize the LANGUAGE school for the
uninitiated:

1) Works from a different poetic/philosophical
tradition than "mainstream" contemporary poetry:
embraces and extends the more obviously experimental
modernisms of Gertrude Stein, Louis Zukofsky, Ezra
Pound, Charles Reznikoff

2) Focuses on collage, rather than the traditional
unified, coherent readerly text
Foregrounds the ruptures and frayed edges of language:
polysemy of language, the gaps in conventional
narrative (gaps usually left unacknowledged)

3) Foregrounds the materiality of text: sound, shape,
grammar (morphology of the sentence)

4) Dismantles conventional reader/writer binary:
reader is a coproducer of the text

5) Disrupts conventions of reading: expect the
unexpected. The unfamiliar helps us become aware of
the political implications of standardized and
homogenized speech & writing just as the
recontextualization of the familiar (cliché, for
instance) is  defamiliarizing

6) Blurs boundaries between discourses and genres:
poetry, philosophy, criticism, biography, prose,
verse, etc.

7) Displacement of the "I" even in "personal" writing.
 Suspicion of the univocal or unitary "self"

8) Fosters and encourages interpretive and writing
communities. Work of art exists in simultaneously
supportive and adversarial conversation with other
works of art. Interrogates notion of work of art as
"cultural artifact"

2. Only the neutrinos of the sun are counted.
3. Attempt the autobiography of rot.
4. The amalgam of orginality is influence.
5. Listen to the goes of poetry.
6. It also overlaps "get on with it."
7. Poetry, like water, evaporates.
8. Tomorrow there will fraught the later poem.
9. On the one hand, it's poverty! On the other hand, it's just poverty.
10. Use it up / wear it out / make it do / or use it up / wear it out
11. Try to parent at least on person in the room the poem will hate.
12. It's the quantity of attention paid to a poem that matters.
13. Fold the manuscript neatly in half.
14. Begin by separating all the poems you wish to submit into tears.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Mary Jo Malo's opposition of prose and poetry (which eliminates the
possibility of prose poetry--perhaps, Mary Jo, you mean to oppose prose
and verse [free or not]?) leads me to pose a question to the list that
came up during a conference panel on prose poetry that I participated in
last weekend (the panel featured Kazim Ali, Jessica Treat, Richard Deming,
and Dennis Barone).

I suggested at the session that there wasn't much use in trying to set
defining boundaries around the prose poem (or any genre), because the
attempt to create such boundaries would always be frustrated by one or
more exceptions. This is not to say that discussion of such boundaries
isn't useful, or that the attempt to define a genre that is impossible to
define might not also be useful--especially for readers and/or critics who
can use that discussion itself as a way to get a handle on reading
experience/critical discourse. But one is not any more likely to define
"prose poem" than one is to define "poem" or "novel" to everyone's
satisfaction.

Someone in attendance wondered if by giving up the attempt to define the
genre we weren't conceding too much rhetorical ground. It seemed to me
like a question that would only concern a critic and would not concern a
poet (who wasn't also a critic). But in these last thirty years, the line
between poet and critic has blurred, hasn't it, and it occurs to me that
many poets on this list might be concerned with giving up that rhetorical
ground.

So my question is this: when we've so consciously broken down the
boundaries among genres, when "is it a poem?" is not a meaningful question
for many of us, and when fiction and non-fiction are converging (as
genres) and may be ultimately indescernible, does "genre" exist any more
as anything other than a label to tell the bookstore where to shelf the
book? Did it ever?

Best,
bc

        Subject:        prose cleverly disguised as poetry


I don't think anyone epitomizes Mairead's proposition more than
Dalachinsky,
and he's obvious, not devious about it. In fact, if you try to  engage him
in
conversational e-mail, his words are almost non-existent,  minimalist
poetry.
By limiting our posts to one per day and restricting  the format primarily
to
announcements and discussion, we have an unusual  opportunity to do more
than
just complain. Although, if we're creative enough it  may sound like
dialectic.

I've had the joy of reading prose that reads like poetry and poetry that
reads like prose. I prefer the former. And of course, there's that in
between
thing, prosody? I think Lautreamont is known for his attempts, but I'm not
sure.
 Pound too?

The topic of an author's life being inseparable from his work and his
affect
on his culture and future generations is very interesting. If you think
about or imagine what it would be like if we were such great influences,
how
would we live our lives? Were the great ones aware of their impact, and
how did
it affect their personal lives and their writing? Did they feel
pretentious,
authentic or responsible?

Wondering,
Mary Jo

Dear Mairead,

As an editor I found your last post offensive. I think it is unfair to
assume that just because we need to pair things down for others to
increase their capacity for insightful meaning that we would do
something as rash as enforcing an honor code among you poets.

I would never do such a thing. While earlier this evening I did edit
ones overuse of paradox as well as a particular reoccuring alliteration,
that was only in conversation. On the page or the web I am much
different and expect consideration.

How do you know I am not editing you right now through various dipthongs
and glottal sounds? We have already agreed that I will be percieved as
thinking a stressmark into your name each time an e-mail from me
arrives, could I not be doing the same with this post? This _is_ my
experimental e-mail which runs at a different wavelength than other
e-mails and therefore contains a different bombarding light bombast to
edit interiorities. And besides that, there is the obvious, I could be
copying and pasting your letter to my tablet and blacking parts of it
out with a grease paint pencil sitting here from a collaborative project
someone asked me to do where I cross out their words. I could be
covering my ears even.

It is only because I am an editor that I can always send so many poems
to poetics. See I publish others poems, and often cause problems by
editing them and that earns me the right to send them to the list. For
the next post, even if I revert back to dactylic hexameter, meted out in
quatrains, for 52 lines you will know that I am allowed to do this not
only through the visual proof but because I am an editor.

Since it is always fine to talk about editing I will just sign this
without making it seem didactic or like an allegory.

Be well

Christophe, what a  wonderful poetic doing. I feel dirty and more human after
reading it.  Insidiously, almost surgically, it removes something vestigial
inside me,  that last bit of something that inhibits me. It gives me a new
freedom for  seeing and writing the rest of the day. Thank you.  Here's what
poetry can  do (from Company of Poets group).
****************************
Back in January the  Buffalo Poetics list began to undergo the knife. Whether
the surgery was  elective, cosmetic, or critical is debatable; but I don't
wish it to spill over  here into our Company. In this controversy which is still
running its course,  Steve Dalachinsky made the following poetic 'comment'
and proceeded to merge  what appears to be a personal experience, thereby
inspiring my poem, "the  waiting room". I love this process and find that more than
anything, feelings  about facts & feelings about feelings reveal who we are,
who we're  becoming, and stimulate a like response in others. Mary

Dear Murat, it seems to me that Pound's Canto #45(?) which begins, if I remember it correctly, "With usura hath no man a house of good stone" is simply about usury and has no anti-Semitic implications if you take it on it's own terms.  Of course, Pound was an anti-Semite for much of his life, although he disowned it at the end.  Nevertheless, this great poem is arguably only about usury and has nothing to do with Jews.  How Jews became associated with usury seems to me to have something to do with Shakespeare.  Whether there was any basis in fact for this, I don't know.  Anyway, it seems possible to criticize usury without it being taken as being an inherently anti-Semitic statement.  It's interesting that in The Merchant of Venice, when Shylock refuses the money, he is forced to become a Christian.  This also seems to be as much if not more a statement about Christians than Jews.  Whatever your thoughts are on that bit of Shakespeare, I think the one Pound Canto can be taken
, in
 isolation, as not being about Jews, pro or con.

This does not mean that the reader has to see the work by charting biographical parallels. In my case, a few poets I admire and and am deeply affected by are offensive as human beings to me, including in aspects of their work. For instance, I can not stomach Pound's rants about usury, always with echoes of Jews with big noses. Despite that, there is nobody who has said truer things about American poetry than Pound. I have to live with both, neither erasing the truth of the other.

Amigo/as:

I have been what I think might be described as a "lurker"
on this list, oh, for about the past three or so years.
I use the term not knowing if it's a pejorative one or not
in the vocabulary of list-serves. I have particularly appreciated
the list when it has directed me to other places on the web.
For example, as a native San Franciscan and alumnus
of UC Berkeley who is currently in the Midwest,
I very much appreciated being alerted to the recent
two-part feature on Thom Gunn published in the SF Chronicle
recently. Gunn was a former teacher and his death a year ago
seemed much too soon.

In the spirit of sharing recent poetry-related news, I want
to take this moment to announce to the list the publication
of my first full-length collection of poetry. An insightful online
review of it can be read in the current issue of RAIN TAXI (link below)
out of Minneapolis. My poems and translations have appeared
variously, including in CHAIN, ELECTRONIC POETRY REVIEW,
and JACKET (see link below).

I think the poetry umbrella has become too encompassing to say absolutely
that something is or isn't a poem. Regardless of what part of the umbrella a
poem appears in, I like it to create a sense of moving in the moment, even
if I don't know where it's going. Whether this post is a poem or not--and I
know of course it isn't by its very presence here--- it conveys the movement
that I like to experience in a poem.

In my reading Canto 45 is not necessarily anti-Semitic, but as a "hymn
to an obsession" (as one critic wrote) seems symptomatic of a pattern of
Pound's anti-Semitic activities and works. You can love the man and hate
his anti-Semitism. Charles Olson's _An Encounter at Saint Elizabeth's_
(1975) is a fine case in point. Sick of his anti-Semitism and racial
diatribes, Olson finally decided he could no longer visit Pound, but was
always "analytical" (in Olson's way) and appreciative of Pound's value
for him as well as for American poetry.

On another note, I could be wrong but I always thought usury was
traditionally associated with the Jews because of prohibitions against
usury by the Catholic Church. After a certain point (18th cent.?) the
definition of usury changed from the strict "lending money for interest"
to "lending money for exorbitant interest." (With the current practice
of personal credit, one wonders if any religious-financial prohibitions
yet apply.)

I have no problem reading the person with the work. (Or of reading the
work by itself, if that's all I have.) Perhaps some with neo-New
Critical take (though they'd rarely consider it that) disagree?

The question that I would like to discuss is can poetry be revolutionary?
and revelatory?

I frankly don't care about individual poet's statements or aesthetics this
is merely a starting point for the work if you are a slave to your aesthetic
you are not an artist but a sycophant; what I care about is does the artform
speaks to more people than 100 poets at 50 Universities, who run 20 small
presses and 25 magazines?

I think that poetry in the US made a great leap last year with Poets Against
the War because poets especially experimental poets, were engaging with
society and challenging society.  This is not to disrespect poet as Artist.
Many times however Art just for Art's sake can be dilettantism. Forget about
Pound (Of Blessed Memory) or Stein and look at poets who in other cultures
have been agents of change and functioned as a Greek Chorus in their
societies.

The question is audience and challenging the established paradigm of our
society that should be the poet's work that was the work of Celan, Neruda,
Vallejo, Cardenal, Akmatova, Mandelstham, and so many others.  I think that
it is easy for poets to retreat into "poetworld" that Habitrail of
literature;  and not to be prophetic voices but then what is the point of
reading our work?

This goes to conversations here on the Listserv. As a poetic community we
need to step back from the irony laden world we have created and realize
that we are living in a time not so unlike the 1930's in its manias and mass
psychosis and when future generations read the poetry from this period will
they be able to tell something has changed and that poets continued in
Pound's phrase to make news?

Traditionally, haiga is a combination of image and poem (haiku).
Here I'm suggesting that, instead of the artist giving words, the image =
can conjure a poem in the viewer's mind. Thus, the image, alone, =
completes the haiga.=20

Murat,
Pound says "usura" because that is the Latin root of the word and Pound, =
a somewhat pompous ass in my judgment, was just one-uping the =
readership...Pound would feel that you're supposed to know the word has =
it's origins in the old language.  Too, I suppose Pound even thought we =
were all supposed to know it was Julius Caesar who passed one of his =
many edicts setting limits on the rate of interest his senators could =
charge for lending their money to the citizen leaders to rebuild their =
city-states after Rome had sacked them.  It is perhaps at that time that =
the meaning of the term begins to take on the context of "excess" as =
applied to interest rates. (Will Bush limit the interest rates world =
bankers will be allowed to charge the people of Iraq and Afghanistan to =
rebuild their infrastructures...?) =20

As for Skip Fox's assertion that the "excess" and Christian association =
of Jews as usurers comes into existence from the Catholic actions in =
later centuries, I wouldn't know, but it does appear to me the context =
of usura employs an element of the meaning of excessive charge from the =
earlier Roman usage.  Does that link the word with Jews?  Not for me it =
doesn't...but in Canto XLV, I have no doubt Pound intends at every =
possible opportunity to ridicule Jews.  It was one of the things the man =
did. =20

And on that point of Pound: what the hell kind of verse line is: "With =
usura hath no man a house of good stone,..."?  Had I authored that line, =
hordes of scholars, thousands of editors and even little children from =
their cribs would have risen to ridicule my skills as a poet.  And yet, =
Pound receives praise...go figure. =20

  Dear Tom,

  Listening to this passage, ""With usura hath no man a house of good =
stone," I remember asking myself, why doesn't Pound say "usury"? In a =
way, everything is centered around this word. For pound "usura" is a =
concept, like the concept of "jew."

  On the other hand, the same line, its inversions and the word "hath," =
represents a new music in English, out of his translation "The =
Seafarer."

  In other words, in Pound the most annoying and the most breath taking =
may be at the same place.

  >Dear Murat, it seems to me that Pound's Canto #45(?) which begins, if =
I remember it correctly, "With usura hath no man a house of good stone" =
is simply about usury and has no anti-Semitic implications if you take =
it on it's own terms. Of course, Pound was an anti-Semite for much of =
his life, although he disowned it at the end. Nevertheless, this great =
poem is arguably only about usury and has nothing to do with Jews. How =
Jews became associated with usury seems to me to have something to do =
with Shakespeare. Whether there was any basis in fact for this, I don't =
know. Anyway, it seems possible to criticize usury without it being =
taken as being an inherently anti-Semitic statement. It's interesting =
that in The Merchant of Venice, when Shylock refuses the money, he is =
forced to become a Christian. This also seems to be as much if not more =
a statement about Christians than Jews. Whatever your thoughts are on =
that bit of Shakespeare, I think the one Pound Canto can be taken

"Usura" is Latin. "Hath" archaic English.  These observations with the
cadence seems to indicate Pound's "originary" text for movement, rhythm,
and sound is the King James translation of the Old Testament.
Ironically.

Does anyone know any first hand info on this reference to Allen Ginsberg
in a recent post at

http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/


_________________________
Of Fulton Lewis and His New Post at PBS

I would imagine that most people have heard of Walter Winchell, the=20
McCarthyite radio commentator and newspaper columnist. Fewer of you=20
have probably heard of another influential McCarthyite radio=20
commentator and newspaper columnist of the period, Fulton Lewis Jr.=20
But, you should probably read up on him a little bit because it's=20
actually going to be important in your own life right here and now:

That he was considered a controversial commentator is mostly reflected=20=

in his strong conservative stances in a time of increasing liberalism.=20=

Throughout the Roosevelt/Truman administrations, Lewis continued to=20
defend his beliefs. In pre-war America Lewis supported and encouraged=20
the America First stance of Charles A. Lindbergh, which espoused that=20
America spend its money and resources on building up our own defenses=20
and stay out of the European conflict. Lindbergh was an admirer of the=20=

military capability of National Socialist Germany.

As the medium of radio waned during the rise of television in the late=20=

forties and early fifties, Lewis' appearance on the small screen was=20
simply not good television. He appeared too much out of place and so he=20=

continued on radio. It was in the fifites that Lewis' star began to=20
wane. He was a strong supporter of Joe McCarthy, the Wisconsin Senator=20=

who presided over the committee investigating communists in the=20
government.

That really doesn't give you the full flavor of Lewis's right wing=20
hackery. He was a Matt Drudge of his day, the happy recipient of nasty=20=

information about McCarthy and J. Edgar Hoover's enemies and targets.=20
And unlike Winchell, who had at least been as hostile to Hitler as to=20
Stalin, Lewis had a bit of a soft spot for Naziism, something that the=20=

liberals of the day (as they are today) were too polite to use as a=20
weapon against his anti-communist zealotry and character assassination.=20=

Allen Ginsberg remembered Lewis speaking of the Rosenberg case:

...especially, there was one commentator on the air, called Fulton=20
Lewis, who said that they smelt bad, and therefore should die. There=20
was an element of anti-Semitism in it. But I remember very clearly on=20
the radio, this guy Fulton Lewis saying they smelt bad. He was a friend=20=

of J. Edgar Hoover, who was this homosexual in the closet, who was=20
blackmailing almost everybody.

(This "smell" thing, which Ginsberg notes is long associated with=20
anti-semitism, is commonly used today by fine mainstream humorists and=20=

commentators like Ann Coulter to describe liberals.)

In any case, what makes Mr Fulton, long dead and mostly forgotten,=20
important you you, my friends, is that his ghost writer for five years=20=

was none other than William Schultz, one of the new ombudsmen for the=20
Public Broadcasting System.

I'm not kidding. The man who wrote Joe McCarthy's stongest supporter's=20=

newspaper column is now on the payroll of the corporation of public=20
broadcasting as an ombudsman.

Here's what the guy said in an interview with Rick Perlstein in 1997:

[Were you anamolous in New York?]
"well, I went to a high school where, for reasons I cannot figure out,=20=

there was a real conservative and libertarian nucleus: The Bronx High=20
School of Science in New York. Bob Schuchman went Bronx Science, and=20
others did who went on to positions in politics and academia. So I was=20=

not unfamiliar with it.

"As Allen said, we were journalists; Allen was, I was. I went to=20
Antioch College in Ohio, and they had a work-study program, and I got a=20=

couple of newspaper jobs, and then I worked for Human Events, and=20
worked for Stan Evans, who had a tremendous influence on me. Then I=20
went to work for Fulton Lewis Jr., who was a radio commentator and=20
columnist.

"He had a fifteen minute broadcast at seven o'clock on the Mutual=20
Network and then a five minute broadcast at noon. And I arrived from=20
Yellow Springs, OH, thinking I was going be his leg-man--I had never=20
met him before--and the first thing he said was, 'can you write a=20
newspaper column?' The guy who had been ghostwriting his=20
five-day-a-week newspaper column had just went to work for Nixon=20
getting ready for the 1960 campaign--this would have been 1959. So I=20
said, 'sure, I can write a newspaper column.'

"So I started ghosting his newspaper column! Then I would go back to=20
Yellow Springs, OH every three months and write the 'Inside Washington'=20=

column from Yellow Springs and send it off to Washington by Western=20
Union the time '64 rolled around I had been writing the Lewis column=20
for five years. So I was in San Francisco not as a delegate or an=20
activist but as a journalist, but as one who believed fervently in=20
Goldwater, and as I said that was the most..."

When they were out of power, the right wing insisted that public=20
broadcasting was a commie plot and should be destroyed. It was a=20
perennial in the GOP platform. Now that they own the government, the=20
movement radicals of the GOP have discovered the joys of taxpayer=20
sponsored government propaganda and they are seizing upon public=20
broadcasting as a fine means to produce and spread it. "The Journal=20
Editorial Report" is the likely future of Public Television. And now=20
they have gone and appointed a real live McCarthyite as their=20
"ombudsman.=94

Media Matters has more on Schultz, and the contact numbers for him and=20=

his close personal friend Kenneth Tomlinson, the newly named Republican=20=

chairman of the corporation for Public Broadcasting who recently told=20
members of the Association of Public Broadcasters that they should make=20=

sure their programming better reflected the Republican mandate. He=20
later said he was joking. Except nobody laughed.

FYI, as Media Matters points out:

According to The Ombudsman Association's code of ethics, an ombudsman=20
is a "designated neutral" who "strives for objectivity and=20
impartiality."

As a starting point for the work as a starting point for the work
as a starting point for the work

my point is what worth is the work
when no one gets past the starting point/

my point is that it's time to go beyond aesthetics and address the
sick worm at the center of this nation that's twisting and turning
and about to surface for everyone to see

problems of racism have not been solved problems of class warfare
have not only not been solved they are being inflamed by the powers
that be in this country

poetry can address these issues (and should) without selling out the
aesthetic camp    and the poet that does this work shouldn't fear
being branded "political"

why is it that poets in the other parts of the world treat serious
topical
themes with aesthetic aplomb and in this country it's has to be
one or the other     these two ideas aren't polar opposites

hear hear

I frankly don't care about individual poet's statements or aesthetics
this
is merely a starting point for the work

Dear David,

Congratulations.  Your post to the Poetics List, "Honor Code" (May 4, 2005 =
12:01 AM) has been selected by me as the post I will answer today.  Other =
posts I considered when making my decision were Brian Clements', WCSU.EDU, =
"Re: prose cleverly disguised as poetry" and my own "Re: Posting to the =
Poetcis List," written in response to the Editors' "Posting to the Poetcis =
List," and which read "This is a little helpful.  My message crossed with =
this. Mairead" and received the reply: "Rejected posting to POETICS@LISTSER=
V.BUFFALO.EDU":=20

The distribution  of your message dated  Tue, 03 May 2005  13:48:26 -0400 =
with
subject "Re: Posting  to the Poetcis List" has been  rejected because you =
have
exceeded the daily per-user message limit for the POETICS list. Other than =
the
list owner,  no one is  allowed to  post more than  1 message per  day. =
Please
resend your message at  a later time if you still want it  to be posted to =
the
list.

I was tempted, David, but your post won out.  I was impressed by its =
craziness.  You don't seem interested in serious discussion.  I can relate =
to that.

I hope you will understand that although I do not address the valuable =
points you raise in your post, I appreciate your perspective and for that =
reason have chosen your post as my "Post of the Day."  This puts you in =
line for consideration for my "Post of the Week's Posts of the Day," which =
I intend to use my Sunday Poetics List ration on, all being well.  Also, =
of course, my "Post of the Month's Post of the Day," and my "Post of the =
Year's Post of the Day," about which copper-plate alerts will be circulated=
 in due course (nominations back-channel only please).

Well David congratulations again.  I hope my selection won't cause any bad =
feeling on the List.  I guess we're all grown-ups and know we can't all be =
winners every day.  But today you're a winner with me.

Mairead

Dear Mairead,

As an editor I found your last post offensive. I think it is unfair to
assume that just because we need to pair things down for others to
increase their capacity for insightful meaning that we would do
something as rash as enforcing an honor code among you poets.

I would never do such a thing. While earlier this evening I did edit
ones overuse of paradox as well as a particular reoccuring alliteration,
that was only in conversation. On the page or the web I am much
different and expect consideration.

How do you know I am not editing you right now through various dipthongs
and glottal sounds? We have already agreed that I will be percieved as
thinking a stressmark into your name each time an e-mail from me
arrives, could I not be doing the same with this post? This _is_ my
experimental e-mail which runs at a different wavelength than other
e-mails and therefore contains a different bombarding light bombast to
edit interiorities. And besides that, there is the obvious, I could be
copying and pasting your letter to my tablet and blacking parts of it
out with a grease paint pencil sitting here from a collaborative project
someone asked me to do where I cross out their words. I could be
covering my ears even.

It is only because I am an editor that I can always send so many poems
to poetics. See I publish others poems, and often cause problems by
editing them and that earns me the right to send them to the list. For
the next post, even if I revert back to dactylic hexameter, meted out in
quatrains, for 52 lines you will know that I am allowed to do this not
only through the visual proof but because I am an editor.

Since it is always fine to talk about editing I will just sign this
without making it seem didactic or like an allegory.

Be well

Well, it is kind of anapestic.

But despite that, a beautiful line, to my ear. Note that it combines
EP's
phanopoeia, etc.

He was hardly alone in literature at that time.  There are anti-Semitic
passages in so many modernist masterpieces - Djuna Barnes springs to mind.
I have just finished Women in Love, and DH Lawrence's racism - which extends
to any exotics with the wrong skin colours (mysteriously ugly Orientals,
femininised dishonest vertically-challenged Jews and savage, barbaric
Africans) - is pretty hard to take.  And that's before you get to what he
thinks women are...

What is it about Lawrence?  I get it about Pound.  He has the ear of an
angel.  Lawrence can write passages of breathtaking beauty, to be sure, but
an awful lot of the time I just find his writing silly.

Best

A

My record label just sent me some advance PROMO CDs
of my band CONTINUOUS PEASANT's second album, INTENTIONAL GROUNDING
for me to send to people and try to get some reviews.

Steve Carll wrote a great review of the first album
and other poets, like Jim Berhle and Stephanie Young did well by us

So I thought I'd just place an open call here,
like first ten people who might be interested in some
primitive melodic "indie-rock" sounding thing

and might be interested in trying the genre of "rock criticism",
I might be able to hook you up with some presses to publish them in...

Anyway, let me know backchannel in the next few days,
and I'll try to get a copy off as soon as possible.

Thanks!

Telling Them Apart


The bird sits as only it can,
head down,
multiplying
the air between you…

Now you see it
rearranging the grass on the lawn,
picking just the right ones
to make a nest with.

Whatever time
has passed.

Another has joined in.

It is still what you see.

"Usura" is latin, and Pound does use Latin, Italian or Greek, not to say=20
Chinese, to separate himself. Does he use Hebrew?

Language is one way of separating. I statement is quite simple, it seems to=20

Dear List My two year old daughter Tennessee just loves Dr. Suess.
She's deep into his Foot Book and now can't get enough of How the
Grinch Stole Christmas.  You know, everyone cites Gertrude Stein, Joyce,
Abraham Lincoln Gillespie or any number of those serious grown-up cats,
but how many language-oriented (as well as vispo) poets got their ears
tuned to the beauty of a well-turned phrase by the good Doctor?  I admit
to being smitten by my late grandmother's bedtime rendition of the
Circus McGurkis and the Cat in the Hat blew me away.  It did something
to me and I bet it did something to many of you.  Fess up now!  Jess of

David Markson's books, like *Reader's Block*, *This Is Not A Novel*
and *Vanishing Point* are constructed mostly from very brief, one
or two line vignettes about authors' and artists' lives.  A great many
of the vignettes note authors who, like Edith Wharton and Karl Marx,
Chaucer and Juvenal, were anti-Semitic. He also catalogues
countless author and artist suicides. Markson is a fascinating
writer to study in terms of the life vs. work issue on the whole.

Dear Murat, if I'm not mistaken, usury was once considered a sin by the Catholic Church.  Since Latin was at that time the language of the church, this could explain why Pound says "usura" rather than "usury."  Just a guess, but it seems logical to me.  Regards, Tom Savage

Murat Nemet-Nejat <MuratNN@AOL.COM> wrote:"Usura" is latin, and Pound does use Latin, Italian or Greek, not to say
Chinese, to separate himself. Does he use Hebrew?

Language is one way of separating. I statement is quite simple, it seems to
be. There are things in Pound's work I don't like; often they do with ethnic
and elitist attitudes. On the other hand I like his work a lot.

In the passage in question, I hear more his translation of The Seafarer than
The Bible.

I don't care much about those statements or aesthetics either. Nor do I
care
about that wider audience, as long as I can imagine two flight
attendants on
the road from LA to Vegas, driving with the top down through the night,
one reading out loud to the other, hopefully the one behind the wheel.

Dodie Bellamy's writing workshop, run for the past fifteen years out
of her SOMA apartment, is a place for people working in prose to get
serious feedback outside the university system. The queer-leaning,
sex positive ethos of the group proffers a tantalizing mixture of
formal experimentation and more conventional story telling.

hi chris (and all),

i've wondered this as you call for book donations--what's the scoop with this
library that they want/need them? if they do want need them are they simply
unwilling to buy them? unable to buy them? hell, penguin poets can afford to
donate their books by the box, but most small presses rely on their library
orders to edge them toward the black, as they charge libraries a higher rate
than individuals.

best,
david

If you don't care, what on earth leads you to subscribe to the poetics list?

Anyone who believes that a statement of poetics and a poem are mutually exclusive objects (subjects, for that matter) is someone's who's missed the history of poetry in the last few centuries of literary endeavor worldwide.  Such a person may wish to consider a list with more pedagogical value than this one.

Honestly, he scared me as a child.
The characters all had sharp, dangerous edges.
And everything rhymed.
But then, I was also frightened by Alice in Wonderland
And later
Most of all
Horrified by Nancy comics.
Reading that was like being dead.

No reason to argue (I wouldn't if there were, necessarily), but the

creates a slight pause which might be similar to but not quite the
domestic
mid-line caesura we've come to know) sounds more beholden to Pound's
"The Seafarer" and Old English reading, than the repetitions (at the
beginning
of line mostly, like the 23rd Psalm &c.) and archaic (King James) word
forms
in Pound's 45th Canto. I've always associated such cadences with the Old
Testament and realize that its sway (with the rest of the Bible) was
profound
during the lifetimes of many of the artists listed in the piece.

But, again, no big deal.

Contra naturum (again Latin, linqua franca of the day), in fact,
parallels Dante's
treatment of sodomites who he places in the same pocket (or environs) of
the inferno
due to his (and Pound's) belief that sodomites and usurers partake in an
act which
displays a central ignorance in understanding: money is sign of value,
not an object
or service of value itself (like corn, teaching, lanterns). Both
simulate the creation
of value wrongly, according to Pound.

Olson's _Encounter at St. Elizabeth's_ is a lovely example of a
post-modern
(he's the first in Eng. to use the term) liberal writer engaged with a
man who
opened up twentieth-century poetry in many ways but who was also deeply
(tragically?)
confused. In an essay on Pound ("GranPa, GoodBye"), Olson feels that
Pound's emphasis
on sight as the central means of knowing was detrimental and removed
(and in this
he way might argue as well with Zulofsky's _Bottom on Shakespeare_ . . .
it will
be interesting to read Silliman on this text in his blog) when placed
above the
"sound" of the human in close engagement/encounter with the particular
("close" in
fact is a favorite Olson word to emphasize an intimacy of engagement--it
was also
the last word of the 4th book of _Paterson_ and the "place" Huck Finn
found himself
in before tearing up the note).  It's a lovely book made of Olson's
notebook entries
after each visit. Not that I really needed the permission to hate a
large element
of Pound's thinking (and perhaps person) but this is certainly a book
which shows
both the love, respect, and hate that Olson had for Pound. (Perhaps I
needed it;
my son is named Benjamin Ezra--after Pound as well as Browning's poem
"Iben Ezra.")

Which gets to the other point someone made, that there is always a
hierarchy in Pound
(he called it the "conspiracy of intelligence" and it's more of a
merited aristocracy
than anything in Yeats or Eliot). Yet Pound was also responsible for
insisting on a human
perspective over a God-like perspective in poetry (and all
apprehension): periplum (how
a sailor sees the seaboard coming over the horizon) rather than
cartographer's (god's)
perspective. Thus Malatesta's post bag is in historical jumble
(according to the academic).
But Pound was not temperamentally predisposed (as Olson was?) for a
total leveling.
I never  "see" him at ship level. At best he's in the crow's next
(describing the exact
hue of light on the water, droning on about inferior races and Social
Credit, writing
beautiful hymns on questionable subjects, being upheld by a lizard,
etc.).

Olson's central indictment: "he does not seem to have inhabited his own
experience"
(_Collected Prose_, p. 146), seems ripe for discussion. (The fact that
his anti-Semiticism
doesn't mesh with his treatment of individual Jews might even be a place
to start.)

The Northeastern University Press Library of Black Literature,
which I direct, has been issuing titles since 1986.  As some of you
know,  over the past year there has been considerable confusion
about the status of the series and of Northeastern University Press,
which faced possible closure last spring.  In November of 2004, NUP
joined the University Press of New England consortium, and I am pleased
to report that the Library of Black Literature and the
Northeastern University Press imprint are both alive and well.
The staff at the University Press of New England with whom I have been
working have expressed considerable enthusiasm for the future prospects
of the series as well as for its strong backlist. (Below are the titles
that are currently in stock and available.)  I am also pleased to
announce that the latest book in the series, Trumbull Park by
Frank London Brown (with an introduction by Mary Helen Washington), will
be published later this month.  (Examination copies of Trumbull
Park may be ordered through UPNE at 1-800-421-1561 or
<university.press@dartmouth.edu>.)
Thanks for your interest and support--please pass this information
on.
I'll keep you updated regarding forthcoming series titles.

Very funny, George. They actually have lovely Celtic and French  names.

Happy Birthday, Maria. You're not really old until you write menopausal

Dear all,

My computer just crashed and I lost three hours of work and I'm in a very
bad mood. It's thus a perfect time for Rhubarb is Susan: Special Bad Mood
edition. Think of it as Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, where instead
of people, it's poems.

If you've had the suspicion that I'm some kind of slobbery kisser that
loves every poem ever written, or, as one not-so-friendly commentator
suggested, that I review female poets on the blog because I want to have
sex with them (take a bow if you're out there), then you will hopefully be
disabused. I'm not getting any tonight.

I seem to remember Bruce A. mentioning that it would be a good idea to
divide up posts to the list and I'm now feeling that this would be
beneficial
as well...

I belong to a copyeditor's Listserv because of the day job and all the
posts are divided into categories e.g., biz, chat, usage, query, etc.

Couldn't the administrator divide up posts to the poetics list along
the same
lines? then when you get the digest, posts would be indexed at the top
and
grouped by category so the reader may scroll through and bypass whatever
isn't of interest at the moment...I think this would be a better idea
than trying
so hard to filter out unwanted posts, i.e., poems

personally I don't think posting poems is that big a deal

but it does conflict
with the gist of what this list is supposed to "do" i.e., foment
discourse on
poetics, current events, art happenings etc. I mean most all here
publish
blogs etc where poems can be posted ad nauseam.

so...

1. any opinions out there in poetics land about the idea of dividing up
the posts and sorting them with a header in front of each subject line
e.g.,
poetics, biz, chat, query, news etc?

2. is this idea too constricting? is establishing a sense of order to
the
list constraining or confining? should it stay random, or as is?

Ok, I'll take complete silence as a "no" or maybe a "yes" but thought
it worth
contributing a few salient thoughts?

In a lot of conversations over a lot of years with a lot of
contemporary poets, I've found that most of them express something
close to prayerful gratitude that contemporary poetry theory rejects,
that contemporary poets don't strive for, and contemporary editors
are suspicious of, a well-turned phrase.

When underdogs bite one another it's a dog eat dog world. If the great
bigoted poets of the past and present never existed, I suggest that modern  poetics
would still exist. Unfortunately there's a thin almost porous line  between
genius and insanity. Poets are people too; and though they have the  nerve to
lead with voice, those who follow have either.

There was a really interesting article on the good Dr. in the NYer, oh,
a year or so ago.  I can't remember it all exactly, but Geissel was
following a timely pedagogy that argued something like children could
learn so many words at a time.  And so each book was a set of words a
kid could master.  So no doubt kids love those books: they're feeding
the brain at exactly the right speed (apparently).

I liked Dr. Seuss books when I was a kid, but as for words and rhythms
that turned me on, it was all about AA Milne.  NOT the Pooh stories,
which I found derivative, even as a child, but the poems--god, how I
wanted to do with words what Milne's "but I give buns to the elephant
when I go down to the zoo" did to me!

I have a review essay on the very good _Dr. Seuss:  American Icon_, by
Philip Nel (Continuum 2004) coming out in the journal _Children's
Literature_ in about a month. For the best biography get Judith and Neil
Morgan's _Dr. Seuss and Mr. Geisel_ (Random House, 1995).  It's great to see
children's poetry discussed on this listserv.

Poetics list member Joseph Thomas has a great book called _Poetry's
Playground_ a study of American children's poetry since mid-century (the
last century) coming out from Wayne State.

The NYorker essay is by Louis Menand:  "Cat People:  What Dr. Seuss Really
Taught Us" 23 & 30 Dec. 2002: 148-54.

Finally, Happy Birthday, Maria Damon.  I turned 50 in January.  It's not so
bad!

"consonants take the place of vowels to create music in a line."
                          --Murat Nemet-Nejat


Now that one's well worth the price of thinking, as they say, or so I
think at least. (Like Duncan--quoting Pound?--writes of "following the
tone leading of vowels.")  Application to Old English line (in
translation)? I was trying to thing about the "clotted" motion or
halting rhythm (a "break dancing"?) in the line, but this might be a
more useful (and better) look. How the emphasis on
alliteration/consonance elides the vowels or relegates them to the
slipstream in passing, emphasizing the (gray?) clanging of consonants.
Useful at least in the sense that now Pound's "The Seafarer" and first
Canto might "sound" those consonants to ear–a way to consume that
musical knowing.

from Kamau, in London
……. So far, after all our efforts, there has not been a single word/response
from Govt/Airport Authority, and the rumour grows louder that whats going on
at CP is not yet the ROAD but a ?new/old initiative of which the road is
PART - a golf course for the Airport’s tourists. To have created so much
havoc, thrown off so many people from the pasture, destroyed a rare
environment, thwarted my perhaps last opp to find a hoom in Barbados and set
up that Institute - all for a secret golf course! it makes you want to turn
to ’sterner’ other measures - at least you can see how these things come
about - not that we have that kind of psychology/raw material in ‘Paradise’

I may be interested in submitting something. How will the publication
be bound, and where will it be distributed?

Also, how large or small would you require an essay? And is this
particular call for articles being solicited through any one specific
department?

Thanks,
Wanda O'Connor

Taken from The Barbados Daily Nation:


The Cow Pasture Capers - Friday 06, May-2005

by Adonijah

Heroes.

What does the word mean, now that the tents have been taken down and the
crowds have gone home from yet another show?

Do we really recognise our heroes? I don’t mean the National Heroes but the
others who are our champions and represent the best we have achieved.

It’s really a rhetorical question because, given the way the authorities
have treated Kamau Brathwaite and his home at Cow Pasture, Christ Church,
the answer is clear.

It is nothing short of a national disgrace that the greatest literary figure
this two-by-three country we all claim to love so much has ever produced
should have to be a lonely voice crying in the wilderness while his
spiritual centre is destroyed.

Was there no alternative? The most disgusting thing about the whole episode
is the bureaucratic coldness with which it has been handled.

Listen, let’s get this straight. Kamau is our shining star, our own poet
laureate. His documentation in poetry and essay form of the physical, mental
and spiritual journeys of the black race is one of the outstanding literary
works of our time. And we are treating him this way?

I know some will want to find out why he should get any special treatment
but don’t tell me that sweet deals have not been made for people who have
done far less for this country.

If you expect me to believe that, you probably think I hang up my stocking
on December 24 too.

Kamau deserves special treatment because he is a special person who has
helped us to know ourselves.

And this isn’t the first time we have dissed him like this. Years ago, word
was that he was supposed to have assumed a senior post in cultural
administration.

The sticking point then was allegedly the cost of bringing his extensive
library to Barbados. I guess no one important saw the significance of having
that wealth of knowledge here in Barbados.

And we must all blame ourselves for this situation. If the powers-that-be
didn’t know that they could get away  with treating one of our icons this
way, they wouldn’t dare.

Shame!

I only know a few, but your question leads to the query:

Once upon a time, in days when the net was still young (dew on its
strands from morning fog), there was a lovely list of all the small and
independent bookstores (I think it was limited to ones with a poetry
section) with addresses and phone numbers.  Listed city by city, it was
easy to check immediately prior to travel.

Does this still exist?

A farewell letter to poetry:

I want to ask everyone here to talk about their conception of 'isolationism'

I feel that because I have no background in studying poetry, that I am no l=
onger able to go on and write poetry. I did study what was called poetry in=
 college but when I wrote poetry what I was trying to do was emulate some s=
ort of style that had already been established, and using my own hopes and =
fears as content for these poems. They sounded/read to my liking at the tim=
e, but it was total fraudulence. I did a lot of emulating while writing poe=
try, all to my liking, at the time.

A time of abandonment now comes when I must say 'I can no longer write poet=
ry, because I can no longer tell myself that what I am doing is called poet=
ry'. This statement has a context: because of the contending nature of poet=
ries while I am at the outskirts of this contention, I have been made to de=
cide between continuing the tradition of poetry, by not really knowing what=
 it is but still calling what I do poetry, and foregoing the lie that I am =
truly writing poetry, as a matter of fact, in order to enter a state of iso=
lation away from all contention, so that I may write freely.

No, you're absolutely wrong in thinking that. I know what you're thinking. =
There is no vacuum to uphold here. I understand my contexts, I understand m=
y boundaries, I understand fully well that I am interacting with elements o=
f poetries. What, then, is the nature of my isolation? Just that.

To go beyond the lies of differentiating between poetries, and to write tex=
ts that, while some may see as expanding the canon, I see as staying as far=
 away from the fodder as possible, by writing with an intent to write. As a=
n act of independence. As a political act. As a lifestyle. I hope you under=
stand what I am trying. Desperately trying.=20

I refuse to write about anything because there is no longer anything left t=
o write about. Writing about really trivializes the importance of those thi=
ngs. It is my hope that writing through such things, by writing as if the a=
ction or thing were writing itself, would be to leave those things as they =
are, as experiences to learn from, themselves the teachers of themselves an=
d their outcomes. I refuse to write to teach, to interpret, to modify or sp=
in by parody those things that are already steeped in ambiguities. Why add =
to them?

It is my hope that, by writing, I can continue to be a citizen, I can conti=
nue writing, I can persuade others to write.=20

This is unfinished. You can continue.

The other day Gary Sullivan reminded me about

Skyline Bookstore
13 W 18th btwn 5th & 6th Aves, 212-675-4773

where I've found lots of books including
signed books and rare editions, including Paul Auster's
1987 novel *In The Country of Last Things*
which I consider to be one of his best. I also found there, amazingly,
Frank Kuenstler's *Fugitives. Rounds* (Eventorum Press, 1966) which
even impressed Gary,  a true rare poetry book connoisseur.

Lots of writers and reviewers go there to buy and sell books .
One day I went in with Ted Joans who
visited often, sold books there and knew the owner. Plenty
of first editions (ask to see their list).
A great place to browse for all types of books, criticism, philosophy, etc,
one of the few remaining refuges of its type in New York.

There's an order,

There are fragrances,

as well as Mercer Books (on Mercer St. betw. Bleecker and Houston.

Subject:      A Child's Garden of Verses/ Native-American Suess
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Let's see: it would have to be Suess and Stevenson.  I loved the poem
about the lamp lighter.  It came a bit later but-- Gorey, I loved his
work when I discovered it in my 20's, especially the uninvited guest.

As for my daughter, we're singing now: "I've been working on the
railroad" is a favorite--esp. the rousing part at the end about someone
being in the kitchen with Dinah...If I remember correctly that part used
to accompany the final swinging tap-dancing/break-down of the
number--the part that brought down the house, and we do it just that
way--we bring down the apartment and have elicited a few "silent
calls" from the neighbors downstairs...but what the hay--you're only
two for a year.

One thing to mention was that Suess was a Native-American.  Though the
books are texts in the traditional sense, they are based (I think) on a
strong oral tradition, and of course Native American lit. has that
turbulent tradition of the voice, the non-written, running through it.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Everybody's been saying great things about the Grand Rubicon 50, and I
just want to go on record by saying that 50 sucks.  Of course there are
things that we have at 50 that make up for the fact that we've drifted
closer to the inevitable end of us, but I think we'd all have to admit
that it would be a lot nicer if we were 20 again.  Why cloud the issue
with these sentimental little lies?  Unless we're destined by genes to
live to be 120, or 99, or 90, fifty marks the end of late middle age and
the beginning of the one-foot-before-the-other-creep into aching bones,
failing eyesite, occluding bowels and suspected tumors.  It would be
good if we kept our minds with us but even they begin to do the
belly-float when we misplace the car keys or put up postit notes to
remind us to answer the phone.  And how about that wisom of old age
hog-wash, or the lie of the dignified death?  Screw 50!  Fuck getting
older!  Piss on death!  And happy birthday Maria, may you have 50 more!

Dlyn Fairfax Parra & Austin Publicover

Saturday, May 7, 7pm
Ortspace
121 E. 7th Street
(use entry on east side of building, at alley door)

Admission: $5; Students $3

*

this just in from Dlyn and Austin:

*

"an effort to ease a much awaited reunion / all your doing / the fated =
error
of hazily"

for the volatile performance duo comprised of Austin Publicover and Dlyn
Fairfax Parra (quoted) plus the soundtracks found in dreams and =
performance
art antics a la Karen Finley, maybe Paul McCarthy circa 1981.  "in the
living room we weld together./A moments cruelty, a moment's terror, a
moment's. reverence.They did it to us first!"

Saturday May 7 2005, 7 PM at Ortspace 121 East 7th Street (@ 7th Avenue)
come get ZAPPED by two of Tucson's most brazenly experimental =
performance
poets as POG presents an evening of surprises from the underground side =
of
the scene, a slippery syrup that gilds "the incessand demand / of these
bodies / still moving."

 Dlyn Fairfax Parra, widely known and variously published for her =
sensuous
explorations of poetry that owe as much to L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE =
theory as they do
romantic abstractions  revealing wonderment, generates delightful and
challenging performances.

Austin Publicover's current project, MS. TREMORKEEPER, explodes notions =
of
gender and sound in fell swoop after fell swoop. An assembler of =
randomized,
appropriated, and taxonomical terms & sound, Ms. Tremorkeeper frees the
referent from its mundane servitude and connects it to the severed =
destinies
of the Witness.

I don't know Jesse.  Not that I have reached 50, and given the truths about
the body heading towards its aging.... I don't have the elasticity and
physical toughness I once did - but -  I loved turning 40, and wouldn't be
20 again for quids - it was horrible!

Chris Casamassima: I wrote and studied verse many years, but it took a long
while before I realized that I didn=B9t really want to write about my feeling=

and thoughts, I just wanted to write poems the way a painter wants to paint
by representing or by inventing the world but at least he doesn=B9t have to
=B3say=B2 anything. Put another way, I=B9m not interested in my own inner life.
But that doesn=B9t mean I can=B9t write verse free or otherwise, although I hav=
e
been conposing visual poems mostly but not exclusively for many years. As
for imitating other poets, how about taking a poem no longer in copywrite
and redoing it the way you think it sounds or reads better. Or translating
poems?

from _After Fifty: Glint on the Golden Years_ by Richard LePauvre:

Some mid-mornings you will find yourself smiling for no apparent reason,
but you will know with every cell of your being that this smile is a
sign of definite satisfaction, that there is a discernable purpose in
the world for such happiness, etc., and you will think back to remember
the occasion of this human joy, and you will remember the grand dump you
took on waking, its ripeness now like a large meal settling into memory
glands of your cortex like a cat about to sleep, and you will but smile
the more. (I.e., sometimes the pleasures associated with aging are more
than compensatory for age itself. Dig?)

Great Andaman King, whose tribe had miracle tsunami escape, is dead

King Jirake=92s death in a Chennai hospital last month is a huge loss =
for=20
those trying to break linguistic barriers

ABANTIKA GHOSH

NEW DELHI, MAY 2: Four months ago, his tribe=92s near-miraculous escape=20=

from the devastating tsunami catapulted King Jirake to fame. His=20
interviews describing the disaster, and how his tribe was adjusting in=20=

their new quarters in Port Blair, made headlines across the world.

But all that was in stark contrast to the 65-year-old=92s quiet and=20
painful death in a Chennai Hospital on April 17=97the tribal chief died=20=

of brain haemorrhage and consequent paralysis.

  And apart from the 49 remaining members of his tribe, including=20
Jirake=92s grandson Berebe, who was born days before he died, the only=20=

other people mourning his demise were a group of researchers from the=20
School of Languages in Jawaharlal Nehru University.

For, Jirake was the last member of his tribe who knew all the 10=20
variants of the Great Andamanese language. With his death, the=20
trilingual Great Andamanese-English-Hindi dictionary that Professor=20
Anvita Abbi=92s team from JNU is working on, has suffered a setback that=20=

it will probably never be able to fully recover from.

Not more than 18 of Jirake=92s remaining tribesmen speak Great =
Andamanese=20
and, after him, there are just five who speak it fluently.

Speaking to The Indian Express from Port Blair, Alok Das, a=20
sociolinguist member of Professor Abbi=92s team, remembers the day =
Jirake=20
died. =91=91At around 10.30 am, when I reached the Adi Basera tribal =
guest=20
house in Port Blair where the tribe is presently lodged, I was bemused=20=

when everybody who I met wanted to shake hands with me. In the=20
one-and-a-half months I have been here, the Great Andamanese had never=20=

shaken hands with me before.=94

It was only after some time that Das realised that Jirake was gone and=20=

the tribe traditionally shook hands only when there was a death in the=20=

community.

For Abbi, a professor in the department of linguistics, the greatest=20
irony of Jirake=92s demise is the fact that days before he suffered the=20=

brain stroke, Jirake was found drunk in the streets of Port Blair.=20
=93Alcoholism is something we have introduced among the tribals and that=20=

is only speeding up the process of their extinction. Even in his death=20=

bed, Jirake repeatedly asked for liquor,=94 she says.

Describing her project as a =91=91race against the setting sun=92=92 =
now, Abbi=20
says, =91=91Any disappearance of a unique language is a big loss because =
it=20
also means disappearance of indigenous knowledge and culture. Jirake=20
had vast knowledge about not just his own people but also other tribes.=20=

He was multilingual, his father was from the Bo tribe and his mother=20
from the Cari tribe. The tribes are now extinct, but Jirake spoke both=20=

their languages apart from a host of others like Jeru, Khora and=20
Pucikwar.=92=92 The king also knew Burmese and a language called Sadari=20=

spoken in the tribal areas of Ranchi.

Turning 50 was my worst milestone birthday. I didn't mind turning 30 because
I felt that I was doing what I wanted to do (write) and after two bouts with
Hodgkins Disease in my 20s, was lucky to be alive.

40 wasn't bad because I was still writing and had lived longer than I'd
expected to live when I was 30. I could work out 6 rounds a night boxing a
heavy bag. The only bad thing was the nagging minor injuries that started to
happen a fwe months before my birthday.

50 sucked because I was still writing and getting nowhere. I had exhausted
myself physically with my poetry band, my biggest accomplishment to that
point, and no longer had the health to keep it going. My day job stunk. I
had just finished my midlife crisis. I celebrated my birthday with my wife
and maybe my best friend, I can't remember. About the only good thing in my
life that year was my wife.

I'm going to turn 60 in October. Even though I don't enjoy my body's slowing
down and I'm experiencing some of the health problems associated with aging,
I feel a lot better about it than I did about turning 50. Thanks to the
Internet, my writing has finally found its way to a few readers. People I
respect tremendously are praising it. I've waited 45 years for this. I've
retired from my day job and don't have to do anything except write. A
lifelong struggle has turned into a great life and for the first time I can
say I truly feel like one of the luckiest people alive.

Yes, I wish I had the energy I had before, say age 42. I wouldn't want to be
20 again unless I knew what I know now. I wish I didn't have my health
problems. I wish I could party till dawn, sleep till noon and start over teh
next day.  But I'm doing exactly what I want to do and don't have to look
over my shoulder and worry about getting fired every time I write a line.

There's my two cents.  To anybody who turns fifty, I wish you a happier one
than mine and hope that your life improves after you've passed the
half-century milestone.

Vernon

Hello everyone,

Blackbox' spring gallery is now on line.  Once again I received a truckload
of submissions.  Many thanks to all who continue to support my little project.
As always, go to WilliamJamesAustin.com and follow the Blackbox link.  Then
take a long stroll (scroll) through the galleries until you reach the latest
offering.  Of course, nothing stops you from checking out previous galleries
along the way.

The Spring 2005 gallery exhibits the following returning artists and
newcomers:  Sheila E. Murphy, John M. Bennett, mIEKAL aND, david-baptiste chirot,
Carlos Luis, Vernon Frazer,  Skip Fox, Tom Savage, Steve Dalachnsky, Edgar
Carlson, jUStin!katKO, Jeff Harrison, and ric royer.

You might (if you have the time) also check out some of my own work on the
WJA page.  I've added a few items.  Some of the poetry is from my last book, 7
UNDERWOR(L)D 8:  TRANSTEXTUAL.  A few of the graphic art pieces were included
in Carlos Luis' wonderful show at the Durban Segnini Gallery in Miami.  I
you've yet to view the show, mIEKAL aND has put together a snazzy website/record.
Go to spidertangle.net and follow the link.

Enjoy!

Best, Bill

40 wasn't bad because I was still writing and had lived longer than I'd
expected to live when I was 30. I could work out 6 rounds a night boxing a
heavy bag. The only bad thing was the nagging minor injuries that started to
happen a fwe months before my birthday.

50 sucked because I was still writing and getting nowhere. I had exhausted
myself physically with my poetry band, my biggest accomplishment to that
point, and no longer had the health to keep it going. My day job stunk. I
had just finished my midlife crisis. I celebrated my birthday with my wife
and maybe my best friend, I can't remember. About the only good thing in my
life that year was my wife.

I'm going to turn 60 in October. Even though I don't enjoy my body's slowing
down and I'm experiencing some of the health problems associated with aging,
I feel a lot better about it than I did about turning 50. Thanks to the
Internet, my writing has finally found its way to a few readers. People I
respect tremendously are praising it. I've waited 45 years for this. I've
retired from my day job and don't have to do anything except write. A
lifelong struggle has turned into a great life and for the first time I can
say I truly feel like one of the luckiest people alive.

Yes, I wish I had the energy I had before, say age 42. I wouldn't want to be
20 again unless I knew what I know now. I wish I didn't have my health
problems. I wish I could party till dawn, sleep till noon and start over teh
next day.  But I'm doing exactly what I want to do and don't have to look
over my shoulder and worry about getting fired every time I write a line.

There's my two cents.  To anybody who turns fifty, I wish you a happier one
than mine and hope that your life improves after you've passed the
half-century milestone.

Vernon >>

As one of those people old Vernon respects (I think, I hope, maybe not), I'd
like to plug some of that writing to which he refers.  I just finished
Commercial Fiction and Stay Tuned to This Channel and other stories.  Very cool
indeed.  Buy and read.

Remember, everyone:  life is never wrong.  Think about it.

Best wishes to all you wise old heads.

Best, Bill

I wander up and down in my father's caravan.
The camels are old   they are laden with wine and cloth
And the ground yes the ground is stony and hard to traverse
The camels move and I   I work back across the limits
from one end to the other covering double the distance perhaps
Perhaps covering half   or now a slow wave my father's caravan
and I walking   the route of the stony ground

""Ankara is a wife, Istanbul a mistress"" (Murat) that is to say
Ankara geveret Istanbul isha    no that is incorrect, it means
nothing in no language    I walk back against the dark order
of forgotten language   the camels   gamal   they are walking
the cliffs

Between them there is a woman

Among them a woman  More and more is forgotten   the brass
knives    something for food   jewels pale before her   It is an
illness this mind   going quickly   I will beg of the doctor   I
will say  hasten my death faster than this   this forgetting
I will cease walking   after all it is only one   an end

I have a tremendous respect for you and your work, as well.

Thanks for plugging my work. I think people should pay attention to
UNDERWOR(L)D as well. It's an exciting, original work.

(Are you listening, World?)

Your message that "life is never wrong" is definitely worth thinking about.
As long as you're alive, things happen, things change. In my case, they
changed tremendously for the better. Bet on life.

As Ever,

The Ancient One

Hey Chris,

Am dreadfully sorry to have missed your reading last Sat. with Albert .  =
It was a full day--Andrei Codrescu flew in to do a special talk at SPD, =
he's a dear friend, and we wound up at someone's house drinking and =
talking for too long until I put him on BART.
    I would like to just once hear you read.  Why don't we read =
together?  That way we'd be sure to hear one another.
    I just now wrote to Jane Ransom, whose last email from October has =
sat festering in my IN my box.  During the school year, the bubble =
envelopes.  Plus, I've had some health and domestic issues that I'd like =
to throw into a big Mix-O-Matic and see how they turned out together.
    Feel like we haven't connected in ages.  What are you doing now?  =
Next year?  I'm no good at reviewing R & R, only jazz, Latin, and opera. =
I leave you and Greil to Dylan.   Shuffle Boil is a place to look, =
though--write David Meltzer or Steve Dickison.  They are always open and =
might know of a good reviewer for your band.
    You know, you also could ask Marina Lazzara.  She's one great one.  =
Why don't you marry her?  You're both Italian and she's is as intense as =
you, working class, grew up near the Hershey's plant in Pennsylvania.  =
She has oriented her poetic life to r & r.   Lovely voice.   Way =
gorgeous woman--she's just turning 40 real soon.  Go after her.

Excuse me.  Meant to back channel Chris Stoff.  How dumb of me, how easy it
is to just press an icon and make everything public.  Marina is in fact
beautiful, she was former MA student of mine.Unattached at present.  Patti
Smith calmed down.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Interestingly enough, I found information on Seuss as a Native-American
in three different sources--one was a Native-American teacher's
handbook that I used back in 1991 in Milwaukee.  The only thing I found
after a Google search was that he was the son of German immigrants and
that German was spoken in his home.  That does not preclude his being of
partial Native-American blood, however, as many Germans found partners
among the Cherokee and other tribes when they arrived.  Is there anyone
out there with has to the complete biography out there who can give us
the final word?

Interestingly enough, The Cat in the Hat is a perfect trickster figure,
and of course there's the ecological concern voiced by many of the
characters.  The use of animals and the use of "oral" texts, all point
to a possible connection.  But then again, Europeans had similar motifs
in their folk tales as well.

Whatever the answer is--and it would be fascinating to find out--I am
ready to stand corrected both for this and for the sin of transposing
the u and the e in the good doctor's name!  The great thing about being
a member of this list is that I'm constantly learning things here.
From where I sit, I can look out across an expanse of people who do not
know more than a lick of English and who could give a shrug about any of
it.  And I've been living here on the frontiers of English for over 13
years.  That's why this list is important, because a few of you care
enough to tell me something about subjects that I love in a language
that I love more than any other.  Arigato go zaimas!  Jess of the East

Hi Gloria---

Thanks for writing. I'm glad you had a good time with Andrei....I was hoping
to make it to that too, but knew with my own reading that evening that I
wouldn't have the stamina to pull it off. I still can't tell if it's just
aging that's making me have less energy or still the trauma and rrecovery
process. Or maybe it's that BUBBLE of which you speak....enveloping.
I'm hoping go back to playing on the streets again in the summer, try to
break the personal prison which is of course also a cultural prison.
Not just academic, either right. But all kinds of social segregation
(and denial about it at that!); gotta be a way....somehow...
Yeah, would be cool to read together at some point, maybe we could get more
than 12 people to show up....Glad you and Jane are still in touch.
Funny, I consider her one of my best friends, but we talk about once every 3
months. When was last time WE spoke? Ah, adulthood! let's do phone again
soon? I hope your health and domestic issues are a little better....
Do you know that I got Marina's band to play a show at an art gallery with
us awhile ago. It was okay, though the PA broke during our first song--
so that was weird....Do you know Greil Marcus? I just found out recently he
lives near here....I'm soo out of it. Ah the Hershey plant, near the
orphanage where my dad grew "up"---

Talk soon?
Chris

To celebrate the sensual experiences of woman & motherhood, and  for all

bellies & legally nurse their babies in public -  Bravissima! Most fortunate are
the women who make time for careers, raising  families, bedding lovers, writing
poetry, and discussing poetics. You know,  the Diane di Prima's of the world?
Happy Mothers  Day!

Remember the Water

Into the deep dark pool
the night of my beginning
to find the  sacred light of me
Ascending through the foam
with my own sun, expanding
shimmer joyous, with babies on my knee
Dripping forth with milk and  honey
we dance the dust, our sweet dew sprinkling
thigh and petal  thirsty, eye to eye
Dervish love all down the garden
And stars we shoot  forth
laughing

Avaricia

There is nothing they have that I want
No coveting here
I lust  for children bright and shining
breasts and belly hard and full, living,  pulsing
No seed-spewer, leaving babies to the wind
More than petal, more  than claw
So roll me gently husband full
and let our cosmos dance
I  am not wrong for wanting what is right

Broceliande . . .

Seven golden summers, honey combed, milky breasted
Seven little  strangers made the home
a sacred garden, alive with ideas
Laughing little  gods on the greenest bed
A new pool in a new land

In their secret garden we see new worlds beginning
but we must leave  them for the forest
so wild and green and ever calling
Tangled and strange  the trees resist
to hide the magic fountain

We dip the cup
to wet the stone
The earth and heavens kiss
Our  story brings the storm clouds down
and thunder rumbles in the mist

and  arthritic calloused hands
on my soft body
suck my full milky  breasts

this green bed adventure
doesn't appeal to many
his blue collar  hands
my hungry hips
making
all nighter utopian daydreams
laughter & intimacy beyond measure
i was just a woman who  wanted it all
a new life
such a kind and lovely failure

The "sensual experiences of woman and motherhood"? "Life is never
wrong"? "Bet on life"?

Ya know for half a second I thought I had accidentally subscibed to a
Catholic anti-abortion listserv.  The idea that womanhood and life
automatically mean motherhood.... oh please. Getr a better subject
line.

Love the poems though, of course. And I have always been a big fan of
Diana Di Prima.

Congratulations to all who are mothers on this fine day. Really.=20

Congratulations as well to all who have have found other ways to
celebrate their womanhood and sensuality.

Suzanne

Welfare Poets: HAITI!!! Words, Rhymes, Cop Watch, Hoods, Barrios and
Teaching KIds

NB. more Hip Hop crews (The Welfare Poets) who take their skillz to
teach kids and put back into the hoods and barrios they come from -- the
deed we need in Victoria: "the Welfare Poets have joined and led
campaigns for the Freedom of Political Prisoners, for the establishment
of Cop Watch, Environmental Justice in NYC, Vieques, and fighting for
human rights worldwide...."


“Uninformed is the worst way to be unarmed.” – The Media, Welfare Poets
RHYMES FOR TREASON Welfare Poets Celebrate New Album MAY 12TH @ REMY
LOUNGE 104 Greenwich Street, Doors Open 9pm $10 Admission HOSTED BY:
Flaco Navaja and Russell Shoatz III PERFORMANCES BY: M – 1 of dead prez,
Don Divino, Alkebulan, Yaya and Special Invited Guests NEW YORK CITY,
Spring, 2005 – Mind-Stirring! Inspirational! Heart-Thumping! The
socio-political collective, the Welfare Poets have compiled a 14-track
lyrical masterpiece entitled Rhymes for Treason. Following the release
of their successful first album, Project Blues, in 2000, Rhymes for
Treason promises once again to deliver transformative, thought-provoking
lyrics with Afro-Caribbean beats, Hip Hop, funk and jazz. Haiti,
Vieques, Iraq, the current state of Hip Hop, and the role of the media
in today’s society are only a few of the issues that have been given a
voice in the new album. Rhymes for Treason is not only information and
inspiration, charging America with hypocrisy in its brand of democracy
and its attempts at capitalist globalization, but it is also an
indictment on the continuing erosion of our civil liberties, evident in
the passage of laws like the Patriot Act(s) and the Anti-Terrorism Bill.
“Our work is to bring information and inspiration to the welfanos of the
world living under a system where we don’t fare too well in order to
collectively determine our shared future,” said the Welfare Poets.

The Welfare Poets:

THE COLLECTIVE: Educators, Organizers and Performers

The Welfare Poets interpret indigenous forms of poetry and music,
including Hip Hop, Bomba, Plena, Afro-Cuban Jazz, Funk, and Blues. Using
the power of arts and culture, the Welfare Poets bring together people
to realize the collective potential, and ultimately address social,
political and economic issues critical to the survival of all
communities. In addition to facilitating literacy workshops for
students, parents and teachers, the Welfare Poets have joined and led
campaigns for the Freedom of Political Prisoners, for the establishment
of Cop Watch, Environmental Justice in NYC, Vieques, and fighting for
human rights worldwide. They are also releasing an independent
documentary about the death penalty due out the summer of 2005 called
“Cruel and Unusual Punishment.”


Most recently, the Welfare Poets performed at a tribute to Malcolm X,
held at the Abyssinian Church in Harlem (New York City) on February 21,
2005, and at the Anti-War protest this past March 19th in Central Park,
marking the 2nd anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq.

ABOUT THE ALBUM

Sak Pasé
 From its monumental revolution and establishment as the first free
Black nation in the Western Hemisphere, to its current crisis, Sak Pasé
is a cry for liberty and freedom for a nation that has contributed so
much to the world; Haiti. The song is played in Cuban Cha Cha Cha with a
touch of Hip Hop, with usage of Haitian Creole. Some terms used are Sak
Pasé, Nag Bulé, Liberté a Ayiti translated to What’s up/Burning or I’m
hot/Emancipate Haiti, respectively. Also mentioned is Bwa Kayman, the
spiritual site in Haiti where Vodou Priest, Boukman held the ceremony
that started the revolution in the 1790’s, which is still inspiring
ideas of freedom and revolution in the minds of millions around the world.

The Media
Written before and after 9/11, The Media examines the role of the press,
its relationship to multinational corporations and their desire to
manufacture an illusory consensus. The epic poem connects the struggle
to free Vieques (Puerto Rico), the genocide committed against the proud
people of Palestine by the imperialist governments of both Israel and
the United States, and the American occupation of Iraq. The Media was
first performed at the historical “The World Says No to War” Rally in
NYC on February 15, 2003 for a crowd of more than 500,000 protestors
against the US’ illegal war in Iraq.

Rhyme For Reason
This song is another call for our modern day griots (Hip Hop emcees) to
live up to the 5th principle of Hip Hop, which is Knowledge, Wisdom and
Overstanding. It is also a show of force in the face of all our civil
liberties being deprived due to the enactment of laws like the Patriot
Act(s) and the Anti-Terrorist Bill. We boldly claim that we fight for
the abolishment of this cruel system of capitalism as we attempt to
expose the contradiction in America’s democracy and their continued plan
to dominate the planet.

The Welfare Poets are: Ray Ramirez (Rayzer Sharp – vocals, coro), Hector
Rivera (HecOne - vocals, coro), Djibril Toure (bass, vocals), Jamaki
Knight (drums, vocals), Emi (keyboards, trumpet, vocals, coro), Angel
Rodriguez (congas, vocals, cuás, chékere), Jorge Vázquez (barriles,
cuás, maracas, panderetas, güiro, congas, bongó, drums, coro), Fidel
Paulino (guitars, coro), Kwami Coleman (keyboards, coro), Camilo Molina
(barriles, panderetas, trumpet, drums), Elliot Cabrera (sax, coro) and
Dahu Ala (trumpet, vocals).

Not quite as bad as an American High School, from what I've heard.  I
haven't had the pleasure of walking into a typical high school English
class since 1979.  I've heard it's gotten a lot worse since then.
Sadly, where America goes Japan follows.  Our first year Meikai freshmen
are just as dull and ill-mannered as (I've heard) the U.S. students are.

Must I Follow


You walk ahead
leaving nothing behind.

All the important things,
you are taking with you.

What matters is
how your footsteps
wake the sleeper in me,
the one not quite following you
since looking back
and hiding are ways
we learn to grieve.

You’ve always led,
me being the weaker
one to stay, the stronger one
to leave behind.

I wave back now,
finding my strength
at last in the distance,
the ever shy distance.

WORKSHOPS

THE WORKING WRITER SEMINAR, with Kathryn Radeff

POEM = SOUND = BODY, with Marj Hahne
Saturday, May 14, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 members

Ezra Pound said that poetry begins to atrophy when it departs too far from
music, and music begins to atrophy when it departs too far from the dance.
How do we source our poems from our own body's rhythms, so that our poems
are bodies of sound-sound bodies-durable because they are built from the
language's meaning and music? Memorable poems are often those that get
inside and move both our brain (what's said is heard) and our body (what's
unsaid is felt). In this workshop, for beginning and practiced poets, we
will generate lots of new writing while attending to sound, with sample
poems selected for their musicality.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson Literary
Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the Arts, Mad
Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled notspeak.

PROBLEM:
I get the mailing once a day with all the subject lines numbered at the
top and, as you all know, it's a bitch to find the individual items you
really want to read.

SOLUTION:
Can't we find a computer wizard who can make it so that there are large
visible markers among the amails, perhaps every 5, so that when buzzing
through them you know where you are, at least roughly.

I envision something big and noticable like a big X and the number 5 just
after the 5th email, 10 after the 10th etc.

This seems like a reasonable computer task. How about asking the computer
dept if they would like to be local heroes and do it for us poets?

Yours in Peace & Poetry,

Poetry and Struggle at AK Press!
Thursday May 12th
7pm
AK Press warehouse, 674-A 23rd St, Oakland

On the occasion of Mark Nowak's upcoming visit to the Bay Area, AK Press
is sponsoring a reading and discussion on the theme of "Poetry and
Struggle." Mark will read from his new book /Shut Up Shut Down/ and will
be joined by four local poets: David Buuck, Dana Teen Lomax, Matthew
Shenoda, and Dennis M. Somera.

Each poet will read a brief statement about the connection between their
writing and the social/political/economic/community struggles they also
engage in and then will also read some of that poetry stuff. We'll end
with a general discussion among the participants and their audience.

Mark's book, as well as all of AK's radical literature will be
available. Refreshments too!

Please attend.
Directions:
AK Press 674-A 23rd. St Oakland, CA

it is come to be a strategy of mine to be conscious of the farewell even as=
 i stand not to know it. what is it? it should make complete and unopposabl=
e sense: it is a farewell to poetry. farewell, poetry. what does this mean?=
 i am coming to grips with saying farewell. the drama eludes me, because it=
 does not include me. in the poetry world, that is, the world of poets writ=
ing poetry, i think it's plausible to say you include yourself. i am coming=
 to grips with the drama of cliques. in baltimore, i forget now what that s=
logan in my head was, it was something about cliques. i have to let go of t=
he fear of saying something wrong because it will prevent me from being inc=
luded. i say to baltimore, farewell, poetry, farewell you cliques and gifts=
 of attendance. i say farewell to poetry because it is you, other, who has =
pushed me to believe it is a farewell. oh, don't cry now, this is getting t=
oo personal.

now i am getting too theoretical...

i have to give myself the right to refuse self-interrogation. i say farewel=
l to poetry because my friends are poets. i say farewell to poetry because =
they attend my readings and events because they know i will atend their rea=
dings and events. i have to give myself the right to no longer censor mysel=
f because what i might say might prevent me from having friends who are poe=
ts.=20

an isolationsim of the task-at-hand is now necessary.

before the cliques i had to censor myself and during the cliques i was afri=
ad not to. after the ciques it is no longer necessary to censor myself and =
what i say. i can say a number of things without the effect because i am sa=
ying farewell to poetry. i've had no time to think about this and cannot th=
ink about this. being comprehensive is a gift i'm unaware of.=20

farewell poetry. my friends are no longer poets. my wife is not a poet. tha=
nk god almighty. but she does want to read with me in rochester.

she is such a terrorist at heart.

Instance Press is delighted to announce the publication of a new book by
Kimberly Lyons.  Saline is Lyons' second book and here is what Publisher's
Weekly had to say about Abracadabra, Lyons' first:
       From the delicate, haiku-like observations ('blue/covers the land/
       its prehistoric gesture a cold wool/skin') to an edgy, urban 'sleep
       in the hubbub/of gestures,' Lyons, without fanfare, picks out
       the intimate, the necessary and the more madcap detritus of life
       in the city, 'buried under pink tarp/bouquets, celullar ravines/
       my hair dripping south.'

Here is a sample piece from Saline:

                   COUNTERPOLE

I came across the word counterpole.
Trees in the Gustave Dore woodcuts.
If words can be guardians or
vertical presences.
As the ninth of the twelfth task.
To originate.
Embroidered pink suns
in which the threads
resembling the rays have loosened.
Construction of some kind,
machines at 4:00 a.m.
The grinding process.
The silence of a figure
entering a forest "at the midpoint
of their life"
Going into the words like that.

Available from SPD for only $10, and with a cover adorned by gorgeous artwork
by Brenda Iijima.

Dear Charlie and all: you'll probably find that changing your
subscription option either to a) html digest (where all that appears
is the title of each message which is linked to the online archives)
or b) set your subscription options to 'nomail' and just read the list
online (at http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html)
does what you'd like the list to do.

To change your subscription options go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=poetics

and from here you can login if you already have a user and pass or you
can get a user and pass by following the instructions at the top of

ADL: Russell Simmons Responds to Abraham Foxman about the Millions More
Movement

Simply put, you are misguided, arrogant, and very disrespectful of
African Americans and most importantly your statements will
unintentionally or intentionally lead to a negative impression of Jews
in the minds of millions of African Americans....You should refrain from
pressuring African American leaders to denounce Minister Farrakhan and
the Millions More Movement. This commemoration is as a real opportunity
for establishing healing, ...for constructive dialogue between Blacks
and Jews.

Russell Simmons Responds to Abraham Foxman about the Millions More Movement
By Hip-Hop Summit Action Network
Updated May 10, 2005, 12:30 am

Hip Hop Summit Action Network Chairman, Russell Simmons released the
following response to ADL Director, Abraham Foxman's letter urging
prominent Black leaders to reconsider their support for the upcoming
Millions More Movement:

NEW YORK--May 9, 2005--Hip-Hop Summit Action Network

Re: Millions More Movement

Dear Mr. Foxman:

I am writing in response to your latest newswire release dated May 2,
2005 entitled, "ADL Urges Prominent African-American Leaders to
Reconsider Their Support of the Millions More Movement." The upcoming
commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the historic Million Man March
in Washington, D.C., October 14-16, 2005 deserves the respect and
support of all people of goodwill who cherish the universal love of
humanity.

Very disturbingly and disrespectfully, you are quoted as stating, "When
will someone in the African-American community stand up and say the
Million Man March had a positive message, but the pied piper is a racist
and anti-Semite? We cannot understand why good people continue to
tolerate this outrage of anti-Semitic views and behavior. It seems there
is a line of denial, indeed a blind spot among many, within the
African-American community when it comes to anti-Semitism."

As Chairman of The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding and the Hip-Hop
Summit Action Network, I know that your above quoted statements and the
urging and pressure of the ADL for African American leaders to
reconsider their support of the Millions More Movement and the 10th
anniversary of the Million Man March will do nothing more than increase
the polarization of relations between millions of African Americans and
Jewish Americans. It is a sad commentary that your actions will only
help to spread anti-Semitism rather than help to end it.

The planned Millions More Movement commemoration this year is about the
mutual love and respect of all people and the encouragement of taking
personal responsibility to uplift African Americans and others out of
the devastation of poverty and ignorance. Over 150 key leaders,
including the NAACP, National Urban League and the National Rainbow PUSH
Coalition, have signed on to be National Co-Conveners of the Millions
More Movement and have all pledged to stay focused on the redemptive
message and agenda of the commemoration.

Ten years ago, under the leadership of Minister Farrakhan, the Million
Man March not only "had a positive message," it also had a positive and
profound impact on millions of African Americans and others across
America and throughout the world. After the Million Man March there was
a dramatic decrease in self-destructive violence among young African
American males in the major urban centers and a tremendous increase in
youth mentorship, Big Brother, and child adoption programs and projects
in every region of the nation.

Simply put, you are misguided, arrogant, and very disrespectful of
African Americans and most importantly your statements will
unintentionally or intentionally lead to a negative impression of Jews
in the minds of millions of African Americans. Similar to how you
single-handedly caused millions of persons to flock to see the "Passion
of Christ" in defiance of your call for non-attendance, you are going to
precipitate a tremendous negative defiance of your demands that will
again severely hurt and harm relations between Jews and African Americans.

You should refrain from pressuring African American leaders to denounce
Minister Farrakhan and the Millions More Movement. This commemoration is
as a real opportunity for establishing healing, reconciliation and
fostering a more effective environment for constructive dialogue between
Blacks and Jews. We want a society and world were there is no hatred,
anti-Semitism, violence, or poverty. For the record, we do not and would
not support or endorse any person's viewpoint that is anti-Semitic,
racist or hateful. You should, therefore, be working with us toward
building more compassion and love among and between all people.

For over 50 years, Minister Farrakhan has labored to resurrect the
downtrodden masses of African Americans up out of poverty and
self-destruction. A few days ago I personally witnessed him affirm, "A
Muslim can not hate a Jew. We are all members of the family of Abraham
and all of us should maintain dialogue and mutual respect." Our work,
commitment, and lives are all dedicated to uplifting all people through
love, goodwill, equality, peace and justice for all.

Sincerely, Russell Simmons, President, HSAN

Subject:      Poetry is politics
Mime-Version: 1.0 (Apple Message framework v728)
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; delsp=yes; format=flowed

from this week's edition of Al-Ahram Weekly:



Poetry is politics

Arabic is Arabic, a girl is a girl and the land is, well, the land: =20
Tamim Al-Barghouthi tells Amira Howeidy about the poetics of Arab =20
identity
He's back.

It was on a particularly cold winter evening that he returned to what =20=

is probably Cairo's most popular cultural centre, Al-Sawi's Wheel. =20
For those who knew of him -- and they're not few -- it was a surprise =20=

to see promotion posters featuring a black-and-white photo of a half-=20
smiling Tamim Al-Barghouti on the Zamalek billboards, alongside =20
announcements of a poetry reading, ' Alluli betheb Masr (They asked =20
me do you love Egypt?), to take place on 10 February.

The last time his name was seen in the news -- March 2003 -- it was =20
in connection with being arrested and deported to Amman for =20
participating in the anti-war protests on the eve of the US/ UK-led =20
war on Iraq. A week later, Al-Barghouti wrote a poem in colloquial =20
Egyptian Arabic with the intriguing title ' Alluli betheb Masr, which =20=

circulated rapidly and widely on the Internet before appearing in =20
Akhbar Al-Adab, Cairo's best known literary journal.

The poem was in a sense typical. Then 26 years old, a PhD candidate, =20
Al-Barghouti, the son of Egyptian novelist Radwa Ashour and =20
Palestinian poet Mourid Al-Barghouti, expresses his complex emotions =20
about Egypt, his birthplace and the country where he grew up, often =20
separated from his father (Mourid Al- Barghouti was deported the year =20=

his only son was born, and for 15 years, this small family could only =20=

meet on holidays), and out of which he was suddenly and unjustly =20
evicted. Images of fear, love, passion and nostalgia alternate with =20
bitter sarcasm and angry political critique.

To many the poem marked the beginning of a shift in Egypt's political =20=

climate: it reflected much of what Al-Barghouti calls "the collective =20=

consciousness" of a new and unusually politically engaged generation. =20=

Ironically, on his deportation, the poem sealed his claim to fame.

The streets were conspicuously empty due to the weather as the main =20
hall of the Wheel filled with intellectuals, artists, students and =20
journalists representing every possible age group. When the hall was =20
half full Al-Barghouti went on stage: his voice is deep, sonorous, =20
clear. Applause as the impact of his last words lingered: "Love is =20
simple, but Egypt is a complex of many things. It is pretty, bitter, =20
chirpy and depressing. I can sum up the sun and say 'candle', I =20
cannot sum up Egypt and call it my love. People of Egypt, hear me =20
out: they asked me do you love Egypt. I said I didn't know. Go ask =20
Egypt, for she has the answers." As Al-Barghouti told me later, =20
however, translating the poem into English tends to strip it of =20
meaning. A poem in Arabic, his "most efficient" way of expressing =20
himself, is a complete entity in and of itself. Ask him what a poem =20
means and he will respond simply, "What I wanted it to mean, I've =20
already said in it. I'm unable to say it differently."

After They asked me do you love Egypt (Dar El-Sorouk, 2005), Al-=20
Barghouti presented something of a classical Arabic masterpiece =20
entitled Kuffu Lisan Al-marathi (Silence the Tongue of Requiems), a =20
lengthy epic-like diwan on Iraq comprising, according to Al-=20
Barghouti, a variety of stylistic forms: song, narrative, prose and a =20=

range of traditional metres including the Husainaya Buka'eyat and =20
even takhmees.

(The former, "the Husayni lamentations", are combinations of song and =20=

narrative depicting Imam Husain's exit from Mecca and entry into =20
Kerbala, where he was killed. Based on traditional classical Arabic =20
poems, they incorporate Iraqi dialect and are read routinely on the =20
feast of Ashoura, often punctuated by collective weeping. The latter, =20=

"fiving", is a 10th- and 11th-century poetic technique almost wholly =20
absent from modern poetry, in which "an old poem in its entirety is =20
incorporated into a newer poem, so that every line in the older poem =20
becomes part of a corresponding line in the new poem").

The result is a unique book -- unlike anything Al-Barghouti has =20
written, probably unlike anything that has ever been written in =20
Arabic -- a fusion of techniques he found necessary on feeling "that =20
everything was threatened", as he explained to me in his parents' =20
house, off Hoda Sharawi Street, where he still lives.

Fascination with his father's poetry formed only part of the drive to =20=

study "the language of heroes", as the seven-year-old Tamim attempted =20=

to write his first poem. Of the next 20 years' yield of poetry -- and =20=

Al- Barghouti is remarkably prolific -- the Egypt and Iraq diwans =20
seem to stand out. Since his first and second collections of poems -- =20=

Mijana, written in Palestinian colloquial and published in 1999 in =20
Ramallah and El-Manzar (The Scene), in Egyptian colloquial, published =20=

by Dar El-Sherouk in 2000, Al-Barghouti has established himself as a =20
master of Arabic language and history -- an achievement unmatched in =20
his generation of literati.

The poet, who at the age of 28 also teaches political science the =20
American University in Cairo, strives to counter the collective Arab =20
depression, according to which "nothing matters" -- a mood that robs =20
people of confidence and concern. (In this sense, indeed, he is a =20
breath of fresh air to many Arab nationalists and others concerned =20
about the gradual extinction of political as much as poetic identity.)

The depression, he says, "has reached language -- we think our =20
language and moral codes are not good enough, men think girls are not =20=

pretty enough, girls think men are not men enough." He pauses, =20
laughing. Silence the Tongues of Requiems, which has yet to be =20
published in its entirety -- only parts of the poem were published in =20=

Akhbar Al-Adab -- is but a shout to counter this depression.

When he wrote They asked me do you love Egypt, he explains, the poet =20
was "in a state of terror, anger and sadness -- all at the same =20
time". All through his life he had taken his life in Egypt "for =20
granted". It was "my country and I'm staying here. It is the safe =20
place. Part of what I feel towards Palestine is identical to the way =20
I feel about Egypt -- this very romantic sentiment. But Palestine was =20=

always far, I never seen it before 1998. Palestine is the home I =20
struggle to have, but Egypt was the home I did have. So when I was =20
deported, I felt my relationship with Egypt was jeopardized, =20
threatened. My presence was threatened. It was no longer the safe =20
place, no longer a home I had.

"And I tried to capture an image of that, like taking a photo of =20
someone you love before parting. I was taking a photo of Egypt before =20=

leaving, not knowing whether or not I would ever return. My father =20
couldn't return for 17 years." A replay of that nightmare haunted him =20=

as he wrote, which also tells the love story of his West Bank-born =20
father and Cairo-born mother. The more popular part of the poem was =20
written during his first week "in exile". He continued writing, he =20
says, until the length had almost tripled, and only stopped on 9 =20
April 2003, the day of the fall of Baghdad.

"When Baghdad fell, I suddenly shed the fear deportation had =20
instilled in me . I felt it wasn't so much my relationship with Egypt =20=

as everything, even God, that was under threat. It is the greatest =20
Arab calamity in the last 1,000 years of Arab history, more terrible =20
that losing Palestine in 1948 and 1967, more terrible than and every =20
single Arab defeat since the first fall of Baghdad under the Moguls =20
and the end of the Abbasid Caliphate in Iraq. It was as if every =20
conscious Arab lost an arm, an eye, a leg or a head on the same day."

But why silence the requiems? "For [it] is a luxury," argues the =20
first line of the diwan, "to stand and weep for those who fell." =20
Weeping, in other words, is not enough: "You'll have to run and find =20
a way to resist those who are killing your people in the camp, =20
something that doesn't give you the luxury of feeling devastated. You =20=

have to be strong." The poem started with Al-Barghouti watching TV as =20=

"they" entered Al-Ferdaus Square in Baghdad. It took him a year to =20
complete its 40 pages.

"If I attempted, in They asked me do you Love Egypt, to capture a =20
photo," he said firmly, " Silence the Tongues of Requiems was taking =20
a photo of Arab existence as a whole, a whole culture. I wanted a =20
snapshot of that to put in my pocket before someone came and snatched =20=

it away, placing it in a safe box at the White House.

"We don't have that luxury because we do have something worth =20
fighting for. The Arabic language is beautiful, girls are pretty, men =20=

are men -- and the land is the land. And, yes, a million shoes are =20
stepping on us but the feeling that we deserve this is completely =20
useless. Despite all our failures, we don't deserve it."

Shawn Wins PEN Career Achievement Award

NEW YORK (AP) -- Actor-playwright Wallace Shawn has received a career
achievement award from PEN, one of several honors announced Monday by
the writers organization.

Shawn, whose many plays include ''The Designated Mourner'' and ''The
Fever,'' won the PEN/Laura Pels Foundation prize for his work in the
theater. He will receive a rare first edition of dramatic literature,
the writers organization said in a statement.

Other winners of PEN awards included Sam Harris' ''The End of
Faith,'' for best nonfiction debut, and ''Forms of Gone,'' by Yerra
Sugarman, for best poetry.

PEN also gave out a pair of awards for translations, to Tim Wilkinson
for the English-language edition of Nobel laureate Imre Kertesz's
''Fatelessness,'' and to Pierre Joris for his work on
''Lightduress,'' by the poet Paul Celan.

Memoirist Nick Flynn received the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for the
''Art of the Memoir'' and Amanda Jenkins won a PEN/Phyllis Naylor
Working Writer Fellowship.

Bich Minh Nguyen, who is writing ''Stealing Buddha's Dinner,'' was
given the PEN Jerard Fund Award, which honors ''a work in progress of
general nonfiction distinguished by high literary quality by a woman
at the midpoint in her career.''

Dear Sheila & list: about the garbled posts that occasionally show
up:: the reason is that sometimes when a formatted post is sent to the
list the Listserv program, in attempting to correct the problem,
produces the scrambled letters.  All posts to poetics must be sent in
plain text. For more information, please see the Welcome Message:

Part narrative, part satire, part cri de coeur, Susan Wheeler's densely=20
wrought new poems are alternately hilarious and chilling in their power to=
=20
evoke the terrible contradictions of daily life in our media-driven=20
landscape. Wheeler is that rare thing among poets, a genuine cultural=20
critic; her poems use image and allusion with such exactitude that we see=20
the things around us from poptarts to polyvynilled toilet seats-as if for=20
the first time. Ledger is a dazzling collection. - Marjorie Perloff

Susan Wheeler's narrative glamour finds occasions in unlikely places:=20
hardware stores, Herodotus, Hollywood Squares, Flemish paintings, green=20
stamps, and echoes of archaic and cyber speech. What at first seems=20
cacophonous comes in the end to seem invested with a mournful dignity: that=
=20
of "the jangling discourse of our nation." Ledger is a treasure map for=20
those willing to understand the journey.  - John Ashbery

If Baudelaire was, for Walter Benjamin, the lyric poet of the era of high=20
capitalism, Susan Wheeler is a lyric poet for an era of superstores, global=
=20
corporations, and product tie-ins. A ledger is a measure of accounts, and=20
Wheeler=EDs Ledger assesses the place of value in a market-driven world=
 where=20
indebtedness has replaced belief and logos have replaced Logos. Her poems=20
draw on a wealth of sources--from 17th century religious poetry and Flemish=
=20
painting to contemporary consumerism--in an effort to define our tenancy to=
=20
rich lords and concurrent losses to the human heart. - Michael Davidson

"Record Palace" is an astonishment. Susan Wheeler's deft touch and flawless=
=20
ear have produced an irresistible work, both fresh and sage.
- Toni Morrison

Dialogic, atmospheric, a situation plumbed rather than a plot unfolded ---=
=20
a Chicago noir this is and it casts its spell. - E.L. Doctorow

Ten years ago I was stopped cold by Susan Wheeler's poetry. She has done it=
=20
again with her fiction -- an exquisitely crafted recollection of music, at=
=20
a pivotal time for both jazz and Chicago. - Steve Martin

Dear You, Our effort to stop John Bolton's confirmation as UN Ambassador is
at a critical point.  Please take action -- today -- to make a difference.
<http://ga4.org/campaign/boltonchafee/su66derz5jxtie?> Thursday morning, th=
e
Senate Foreign Relations Committee will be meeting to vote on John Bolton's
nomination.  As it stands, a 10-8 party line vote of the
Republican-controlled committee would favorably send Bolton's nomination to
the Senate floor for a final vote by the full body, where confirmation is
likely. But we still have a chance to stop the Bolton nomination in
Thursday's committee meeting before it reaches the Senate floor. My
Democratic colleagues and I have been working overtime to try to convince a=
t
least one fellow Republican committee member to join with us -- to resist
the arm-twisting from the White House and the Senate Republican leadership,
and to instead do the right thing by rejecting this terrible nomination. At
this point, our best chance may well rest with Republican Senator Lincoln
Chafee from Rhode Island. Unfortunately, Senator Chafee has decided to
reluctantly support the Bolton nomination, despite the fact that a new Zogb=
y
poll shows over 80% of Rhode Islanders oppose the nomination.  I need your
help right now and over the next 24 hours to personally lobby Senator Chafe=
e
to change his mind:
1. Sign my petition to Senator Chafee now, urginghim to vote down Bolton's
nomination. <http://ga4.org/campaign/boltonchafee/su66derz5jxtie?>
2.=20
3.=20
4. Call Lincoln Chafee's Senate office at (202)224-2921 and log your
opposition to JohnBolton.
We all know that John Bolton is absolutely the wrong choice to be America's
next UN Ambassador.  But before you call Senator Chafee's office, I wanted
to remind you of a few of the many reasons why:
* John Bolton has politicized theintelligence-gathering process.  The last
thing we should be doing is promoting officials who try to twist
intelligence in order to create "imminent threats" to our country --
especially in light of the debacle in Iraq, where over 1,600 soldiers have
died, over 12,000 soldiers have been injured, plus countless other innocent=
s
of the war.=20
* John Bolton has shown disdain for the United Nationsthroughout his career=
.
We all want to reform the UN.  But why would we send someone who is so
disrespected -- someone who said "there is no United Nations" and "if [the
UN Headquarters] lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference."
* John Bolton has shown a pattern of trying to firesubordinates for no good
reason.   In every case he was overruled, but his behavior and
vindictiveness had a chilling effect on independent intelligence analysts.
It got so bad at one point that Secretary of State Colin Powell himself had
to make a special trip to visit the analysts and boost their morale.
* John Bolton has not been truthful with the ForeignRelations Committee.  H=
e
led the committee to falsely believe that he didn't really care that these
intelligence analysts didn't give him the information he wanted and he just
"shrugged it off".  Nothing could be further from the truth -- he went afte=
r
them aggressively. He also didn't tell the truth about the comments he said
he received from the Ambassador to South Korea whom he said complimented
him. In fact, the Ambassador was very critical of him.
* Many leading opponents to the Bolton nomination comefrom within the Bush
Administration.  The strongest criticism of John Bolton comes from
Republicans, including self-described conservative Carl Ford, who called
Bolton a "serial abuser."
It's remarkable to me that despite all of this evidence and so much more,
not a single Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee has been willing
to oppose this ill-conceived nomination -- yet.  Help change Senator
Chafee's mind. Please sign my petition and call him today!
<http://ga4.org/campaign/boltonchafee/su66derz5jxtie?> Lincoln Chafee has
always said that he is independent minded.  Well, today I publicly call on
him to step out front on this -- to do the right thing and oppose John
Bolton's nomination.  And your follow-up to Senator Chafee's office by
signing my petition and making a phone call may well make the difference.
<http://ga4.org/campaign/boltonchafee/su66derz5jxtie?> Thanks for your help
on this critical issue! In Friendship, Barbara Boxer P.S.  After signing
this petition, don't forget to phone Senator Chafee's office at (202)

Has anyone on this list (preferably in the NY area)
ever skydived? Can you recommend the best place to do this?
Ideally, somewhere that is close to a fabulous spa.

But, Mary, the program had the viewers coming away with the idea that =
former state psychiatric facilities were somehow better, more caring =
facilities than the prisons.  And I don't believe that to be true.

I had a friend, dead now, who developed a tumor on the brain.  It was =
ruled inoperable because of where it sat inside the brain tissue itself. =
 Pressure on the man's brain from the tumor caused his behavior to =
shift.  He had been a gentle man, kind, loving, witty with a quick smile =
and laughing eyes, the laughter igniting the rooms he occupied.  He =
became a monster...quick tempered, angry, hostile.  He took his wife one =
afternoon and put a knife to her throat speaking to her as if she were =
one of the Nazi troops he had fought in the deserts of North Africa.  =
She lived.  He was committed to the state mental hospital. =20

I visited him twice before he died.  Having spent a year teaching in a =
state prison (ooops, Correctional Facility) teaching the convicts =
(oooops, I mean inmates), I had a frame of reference for comparing life =

Yes Alex. You're probably right. My mother was in a mental institution in
the 50's & 60's before they shut them all down. Nobody was stupid enough to
take me in to visit her when I was a child, but the sounds I heard coming from
the open windows one summer day, sounded just like the sounds on the PBS
program which I could barely watch last night. She used to tell us stories about
how the patients-inmates were treated, and nobody believed her. She was
paranoid  schizophrenic so who could believe her? Someday I'll write a poem for her,
very  soon I hope.

But, Mary, the program had the viewers coming away with the idea that  former
state psychiatric facilities were somehow better, more caring facilities
than the prisons.  And I don't believe that to be true.

I had a friend, dead now, who developed a tumor on the brain.  It  was ruled
inoperable because of where it sat inside the brain tissue  itself.  Pressure
on the man's brain from the tumor caused his behavior to  shift.  He had been
a gentle man, kind, loving, witty with a quick smile  and laughing eyes, the
laughter igniting the rooms he occupied.  He became  a monster...quick
tempered, angry, hostile.  He took his wife one afternoon  and put a knife to her
throat speaking to her as if she were one of the Nazi  troops he had fought in the
deserts of North Africa.  She lived.  He  was committed to the state mental
hospital.

I visited him twice before he died.  Having spent a year teaching in  a state
prison (ooops, Correctional Facility) teaching the convicts (oooops, I  mean
inmates), I had a frame of reference for comparing life in both  facilities.
I discerned no differences.

Chris,

It isn't easy -- very little work by contemporary Arab poets has been
translated into English (if you have French there is fair amount more
work you can get ahold of, especially from the Maghreb). I trawl the
web a fair amount,checking in with places like Al Ahram weekly, the
Daily Star (Lebanese), some Moroccan and Algerian sites. Bookwise you
can read up (up to an extent, & the translations are rarely
excellent) on work from Arabic in a few anthologies:

When the Words Burn (An anthology of Modern Arabic Poetry 1945-1987)
tr. and ed. by John Mikhail Asfour (Cormorant Books 1988)

The Poetry of Arab Women, A Contemporary Anthology, ed. by Nathalie
Handal (Interlink Books 2001)

Modrn Arabic Poetry: An Anthology, ed. by Salma Khadra Jayyusi
(Columbia UP 1987). Jayyusi has also edited other anthologies of Arab
literature.

Iraqi Poetry Today, ed. by Saadi Simawe (Modern poetry in
Translation / New Series #10).

There are others. Three essential poets to read up on are Syrian-born
poet Adonis (not only his poetry but also his excellent/essential
book _An Introduction to Arabic Poetics_), Mahmoud Darwich, the
Palestinian poet who now has a selected out 2 years ago from
California UP, and the Iraqi Saadi Youssef whose Selected poems _
Without an alphabet, without a face_ came out in 2002 from Graywolf
press.

This month New Directions is publishing the Iraqi poet Dunya
Mikhail's collection _The War works hard_.

There is also a section on the Tamuzzi poets (Adonis & friends), the
first avant-garde modernist gropup emerging ion lebanon in the
fifties in my anthology _Poets for the Millinnium_ volume 2.

Alison Croggon's Masthead #9, http://masthead.net.au, has a whole section on
Iraqi poets. Not knowing much about Arabic poetry in general, I won't
comment on the contributors or the translations, but I found much of the
work moving and new and interesting in all sorts of ways. At the very least,
it gave me some names to try to look out for.

I forgot to mention a very useful source for what is happening in the
various Arab literatures:

the English-language magazine BANIPAL, edited from London by Margaret
Obank.

http://www.banipal.co.uk/

a subscription to Banipal will keep you in touch with much happening
(the latest issue, for example, has in an iterview with Saadi
Youssef, the Iraqi poet already mentioned who was supposed to come
for readings to the US this spring but was refused a visa by the
State Department -- ironic for someone who had to flee Iraq & live
for 20 years in exile in Europe because he was on Saddam Hussein's
deathlist, and now is on the the Americans' list of Iraqis not
allowed to return to their country (because he was a member of the
Iraqi communist party).

Cheers all,

New to this list: I'm a Dutch composer & pianist in the
process of acquiring a dangerous poetry habit, and working
now at the Amsterdam poetry foundation, Perdu.

So much for the banter - here's the question:

At Perdu, we are interested in presenting some of the
multi-reader works of Jackson Mac Low with poets, actors &
musicians. Through Usenet, I learnt about the piece Thanks
on Ubuweb, and the description of the piece there (as well
as the sound clip) intrigued me; I'd love to find the
instructions he gave, which I suppose must be much more
extensive than the brief note on Ubuweb. Problem is that
this work is almost impossible to get hold of in Amsterdam.

(through the hidden conspiracy of international experimental
music I did manage to get the text of Thanks II, the music
piece - the instructions there are quite detailed)

Do any of you perhaps have an idea of how or where I might
get the original instructions for Thanks?

All help greatly appreciated!

Cheers
Samuel Vriezen

You're right. Sartre wrote about Baudelaire in presenting existential =20

their time, preferring old forms and classic themes rather than contemporary=
 =20
ones.

I worked at Columbus State Hospital and Toledo Mental Health Center for
7 years in the 1970s. I saw very little patient abuse, although the care
was stretched thin (attendents expected to give some shots and all
medications although not allowed by law to give any, etc.). Actually
pretty decent places, but then Ohio tried to save money by
"decentralizing care," allowing patients to live in and visit treatment
centers in less centralized locations, which might have fine if they'd
funded such places. As it happen, all but a few of the patients ended up
on the street, in prisions, nursing homes, etc. The state hospitals of
the 1970s, with all the new medications being used, were far better.

I wonder if Doctor Nudel, in the midst of all his Arabophobia (which I
suppose technically could be classified as anti-Semitic), actually
bothered to read the Al-Ahram article (and if Al-Ahram prints what
it's told to, that would put it in the stellar company of
such "democratic" paladins as, say, the New York Times), or indeed,
has any acquaintance with or grasp of any kind of poetry coming from
the Arab world.  Probably not, I'd guess -- it's so much more
comforting to blissfully wrap oneself in the cocoon of one's
unshakable, and complacent, certainties, and while reading e.e.
cummings at that (who hated Jews as virulently as Pound, while
possessing a hundredth of ole Ez's gifts).

>>"Kansas poems."  Over the next 32 years, he published seven other
>>major books of poetry as well as a long metaphysical poem titled
>>ARK, created over a 20-year period.  He also had a parallel
>>career as a chef and caterer and produced five cookbooks on
>>American regional cooking.
>>
>>In 1993, Johnson returned to Topeka and is remembered by many
>>here for his part-time work as a cookie baker at Ward-Meade Park.
>>The gardens there inspired him to write the sequence of highly
>>condensed poems which bridge common experience to the universal
>>in a way that is both precise and ecstatic.
>>
>>As a "poet's poet", Ronald Johnson is admired by many of the new
>>generation of American poets. Extensive discussions of his work
>>have appeared on Internet magazines, such as Octopus and LVNG, as

To this list I would also add a Penguin anthology that circulated
briefly several years ago, "Modern Poetry of the Arabic World" if
memory serves -- anyway, it was translated and edited by Abdullah al-
Udhari, who's also translated pre-Islamic poetry into
English.  "Victims of a Map," also edited by al-Udhari, has selected
work by Mahmoud Darwish, Samih al-Qasim, and Adonis.  Back issues of
the exemplary journal "Mediterraneans," which appeared in the early-to-
mid-1990s, have excellent selections.

Currently I am teaching Darwish's "Memory for Forgetfulness: Beirut,
August 1982."  More than a diary, more than a memoir, it's a complex
prose-poetic evocation of a single day -- Hiroshima Day -- during the
Israeli shelling of Beirut.

It will be a nice day when San Francisco can do as much for Ronald Johnson -
As well as so many others who found their bearings here. With the exception
of a few street names, we settle for ghosts. Spicer must be exhausted from
floating around all these years! Think we could at least plant a "Spicer"

Mark, re Paris, what I would find really remarkable would be a Rue
Lautreamont. (sorry for lack of accent aigu)

There is a small development in Fairfax, Virginia with poet street names
-- Shelley and Poe among them. Perfect place for a Romantic getaway?

WRYTING-L


As the open spaces of the internet narrow between bureaucracy and greed,
email lists become ever more important. The aim of WRYTING-L is to
maintain a balance between dissemination and conversation, to offer the
possibility of a space of writing not overdetermined by academic rule,
party line or limit of genre. All kinds of writing and discussion are
welcome. The list is run with a minimum of management by Ryan Whyte and
Alan Sondheim and is open to all.

WRYTING-L is an email list for theory and writing, focusing on texts and
comments presented by the participants. The list is managed out of the
Department of History of Art at the University of Toronto. It is open to
anyone, in or outside the University.  The object is to provide a forum
for writing and theory that may not fit within the confines of a
particular discipline, in recognition of the recent interest in operating
between and across theories and genres in the humanities and beyond.

We're interested in all sorts of issues - 'avant-garde' pieces,
psychoanalytical, phenomenological, or deconstructive approaches, etc.

Wryting is cross-platform, cross-gender, cross-reason;  it may involve
embodiments of reader and writer, codework and sestinas, abstract
language, the collapse of genre.

If you are working with images, please give a URL; they won't come through
the list. If you are working on an extremely long piece, you might want to
give a URL as well (there is a 500-line limit on every post).

WRYTING-L stems from the older fiction-of-philosophy list, which presented
work between literature and theory, fiction and poetry, philosophy and
lyric, and so forth. Any discussion and original work is welcome. To join
send the message

"subscribe wryting-l [your email address] [your name]"

without the quotation marks and square brackets to

listserv@listserv.utoronto.ca


Please send queries to WRYTING-L-REQUEST@listserv.utoronto.ca


A digest option is available.

Most really good poets have been "team players," i.e. people more
interested
in the art than in their own careers. At the beginning of the 19th C.
there were the romantics.
Check the interlaced work of Coleridge and Wordsworth in their odes.
Check
Shelley's writing about Keats's poetry and his admonishing of
Wordsworth's
later work etc. Then look at the beginning of the 20th C. Did you
notice that
Williams and Pound and H.D. and Marianne Moore all went to univ.
together?

"...It's clear. When we had the trans-Atlantic trade slaves, it was
millions of people we lost. For some people it's close to 12 to 13, even
15 million people they transported from Africa to America, Caribbean,
etc. For others, like [inaudible] it's more than 100 people they
transported as slaves, but in any case, we know more than 13% of those
people died in transit. That means we lost millions of people. If from
that day to today we continue to lose people, clearly it's a black
holocaust...."-- Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide

century of genocides:  I'm talkin' 'bout the one still goin' on


 On 11 September 1982, Israeli Defence Minister
Ariel Sharon, the architect of the invasion, announced that "2,000
terrorists" had remained inside the Palestinian refugee camps around
Beirut. ...Around mid-day on Thursday 16 September 1982, a unit of
approximately 150 Israeli-allied Phalangists entered the first camp.
For the next 40 hours members of the Phalangist militia raped, killed,
and injured a large number of unarmed civilians, mostly children, women
and elderly people inside the encircled and sealed camps. The estimate
of victims varies between 700 (the official Israeli figure) to 3,500.

Are there in streets named after French poets in Paris, Texas?
I think we could do with a little Baudelaire and Apolinaire down there,
And, maybe, throw in a little Cendrars, too. N'est-ce pas?

Minister calls on artists to speak out on tax exemption

On Tuesday 11 May at the launch of Irelands participation at the Venice
Biennale Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism John O’Donoghue called on
artists to voice their opinion in regard to the ongoing debate on the
Artists Tax Exemption scheme.

In his speech the Minister made it clear that he recognised the value of the
current scheme but acknowledged the concerns of those who were calling for a
cap to be placed on the scheme.

The Minister explicitly called on artists to make their views known to him
and suggested that in order for him to make a stronger case for the
retention of the scheme he needed to hear from individual practitioners in
regard to the value that they place on the scheme.

The Sculptors' Society of Ireland has made its submission to the Department
of Finance and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. The SSI urges you
the artists’ community to also make your views known to the Minister
regarding the Artists Tax Exemption scheme.

Go raibh maith agat a Chaoimhin.  Ta suil agam go bhfuil an leanbh go =
maith.  My own view on tax exemption for artists in Ireland is that the =
concept is more attractive and substantial in language than in fact.  This =
is because most writers, poets certainly, do not earn enough money from =
writing/poetry to make tax considerations very significant.  In the case =
of the cnuasanna or stipends from Aosdana, the academy-type organization =
for artists, certainly it is valuable to have this basic income, untaxed =
(I think it is, perhaps someone in Ireland can verify this).  But I see =
the cnuasanna as being not too far removed from the dole in value: I think =
they are instead of rather than in addition to other no-income or =
low-income support.  Still, I know many artists and writers in Ireland =
whose lives were transformed by the basic income; and many more whose =
lives could be: but it's hard to gain a place in Aosdana.  And of course =
neither cnuasanna nor the dole are options for poets in America, though =
jobs teaching creative writing in Ireland are not major options for poets =
in Ireland.  I'd love to hear an update on all this from Trevor as I =
wafted away from Ireland a long time ago.  Though I'm thrilled to be going =
back in July for Trevor's great line-up at the Cork International Poetry =
Festival.

In other words, it's principally writers with significant sales, e.g., =
Frederick Forsyth, and the film industry, which benefit from tax-free =
status, i.e., it brings high-earning writers and some industry to Ireland, =
I'm not sure how much Irish writers/artists gain.  Trevor knows the =
contemporary scene better.  I know Fionn MacCumhail and the Fianna weren't =
too impressed with it all, back in my day.

Minister calls on artists to speak out on tax exemption

On Tuesday 11 May at the launch of Irelands participation at the Venice
Biennale Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism John O'Donoghue called on
artists to voice their opinion in regard to the ongoing debate on the
Artists Tax Exemption scheme.

In his speech the Minister made it clear that he recognised the value of =
the
current scheme but acknowledged the concerns of those who were calling for =
a
cap to be placed on the scheme.

The Minister explicitly called on artists to make their views known to him
and suggested that in order for him to make a stronger case for the
retention of the scheme he needed to hear from individual practitioners in
regard to the value that they place on the scheme.

The Sculptors' Society of Ireland has made its submission to the Department=

of Finance and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. The SSI urges =
you
the artists' community to also make your views known to the Minister
regarding the Artists Tax Exemption scheme.

For full background information on the scheme and to view the submission
made by the Sculptors' Society of Ireland visit our web site on
www.sculptors-society.ie.

You can contact the minister by writing to:

John O'Donoghue TD
Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism

I say we venture into more interesting waters. Since we can't spell poetry =
using the summer, perhaps we can forget about it and get out.=20

1. Go outside

2. Sit on the ground

3. Forget about poetry.

there is that spicer inscription on the
embarcadero boardwalk near the bay bridge... I
used to run there every week and see it and had it
by heart but now I can't remember it exactly...

they dream
they dream of
dreams about themselves

something like that -- always funny to read that
and look up at the random lost souls and tourists
milling around the ferry building

Best Poetry by the Bay
Only a fragment of Jack Spicer's "Imaginary
Elegies" III made the transfer from page to panels
inset in the sidewalk - but it's enough to provide
a welcome reminder that poetry is something we can
experience from head to feet, and in this city it
may at any minute ambush the unsuspecting as we
walk down the street. Spicer was one of the
foremost San Francisco poets after WWII. Along
with Robin Blaser and Robert Duncan, he embodied
the so-called San Francisco renaissance in poetry,
a school initially clustered around Josephine
Miles at UC Berkeley in the 1940s. In the '50s
Spicer helped make North Beach a literary mecca.
Although he lacked the marketing skills of
Ferlinghetti, Ginsberg, and the beats, Spicer's
influence since his untimely death at age 40 in
1966 has been profound. And it's still
subcultural, if this evidence underfoot is any
guide. Admission is free and accessible 24-7 -
just watch out for some low-lying stone benches
that have brought at least one dreamer we know
back to painful consciousness while on this
pleasant walkway by the bay. Herb Caen Way, a.k.a.
the Embarcadero promenade at Howard, S.F.

It will be a nice day when San Francisco can do as
much for Ronald Johnson - As well as so many
others who found their bearings here. With the
exception of a few street names, we settle for
ghosts. Spicer must be exhausted from floating
around all these years! Think we could at least
plant a "Spicer"

I think you probably believe your tone of moral indignation is righteous.
But I don't think it is.

If you told the editors of a magazine that they are morally obliged to
publish your poems, they'd laugh. Or take offense. As they should.

What makes the people who run a discussion list any more obliged to publish
your poems?

Also, looking at the tone and import of Silliman's post and yours, you sound
more like the Sheriff.

You neglect to mention that publishing your poems to discussion lists is
very convenient in terms of distribution of your work to a broader audience
than is normally possible via publishing in blogs, books etc. But they're
discussion lists, not your personal publishers of your poetry. And you
attract others to do the same thing. So finally discussion is drowned out by
poem posts and there is "a kind of Sondheim-driven silence." I've seen this
on webartery as well, where only your crowd is now posting. It used to be
quite a different list with a far broader approach.

And then when people say so, you and your cronies gang up on them and revile
them most bitterly.

Silliman isn't being a "Sheriff" and neither am I. You and your cronies come
to control lists and simply brook no criticism of it. And you and your
cronies patrol them quite ferociously, as in your post in response to
Silliman.

Your moral compass is adrift if you truly find his post "disgusting". Or is
it all just rhetoric on your part? I'm never quite sure.

Also, if you want to teach--and it seems you do--you may have better luck
teaching writing (rather than 'new media'), where your work is often
outstanding.

Outstanding or not, though, discussion lists are starting to recognize that
they are under no moral obligation to act as your poetry publisher, nor let
the list be dominated by your listserv-oriented poetry publishing agenda. It
*is* rhetoric on your part to insist that they are morally obliged to
publish your poems or anyone else's poems.

Next of course there will be posts calling my attitude disgusting, fascist
etc. It's almost hopelessly predictable and boring. And false. And
self-serving.

Jim, I don't think your fascist. But you've hounded me on how many lists

my familiarity with one contemporary Iraqi poet - Fadhil al-Azzawi -
(and several iraqi writers in general) is thru "Twilight of Empire:
Responses to Occupation" (Perceval Press, 2003). much there about
being a woman in occupied iraq, as well as poignant photographs, for
instance a US soldier doing a belly flop off of saddam hussein's
diving board. strangely, it was edited and put out by viggo mortensen,
populalry known as aragorn from the lord of the rings films. (he's a
much better actor than poet...)

hope that adds to the climate

Dear Anny,

George gave great examples of past Companies, and I'm sure there are more.
However, as witnessed on this listserv very recently, and many other
discussion groups, I'm standing by my "most" as opposed to "some". In the future  I'll
try to refrain from generalizing; if George refrains from  exceptionalizing
and you refrain from taking delight in my trouncing, especially  when I've
immunized by statement with built-in caveat. I suppose I  could pose all my naive
statements in the form of pretentious questions  which would be as transparent
as my innocent desire to be part of this oft  obnoxious, surly bunch of prima
donnas, "some" prima donnas. My lack of formal  education in poetics and my
dearth of poetic friends is sometimes  overcompensated by my declarative stance,
my desire to impress and be part of  this august group. It's the occasional
coming together that fuels my  optimism, and the usual egotism that feeds my
pessimism. C'est la vie.

Mary,
Actually, George's response and his examples are brilliant examples of =
lazy thinking...George draws the conclusion for example that simply =
because some folks attended the same U that they are "team players." =20

That just ain't true; at best, all one may conclude from that =
association is that they are alums of the same U; one cannot even infer =
from that fact that the alums were friends, though it is fair to assume =
they may at least been acquaintances or were aware of the existence of =
each other on campus.

Nor is it logical to assume as in the references to "interlacing" in the =
works of Wordsworth and Coleridge that both were "team players" in a =
broad sense.  At best one might leap to the conclusion they were =
interested in the success (e.g. acceptance by the readers of their time) =
of their efforts.  And one might ponder the point that such =
relationships might be labeled collaborations of sorts.  But one should =
avoid, in my humble opinion, concluding that collaborators are "team =
players" in point of fact, the collaborative activities more clearly =
underscore your point of poets (artists, if you prefer) who =
occasionally, "...come together to break bread." =20

Of course, the linguistic hair splitting here is one's intended meaning =
of "team player."  It is possible George's definition of the term is far =
different from either yours or my own.=20

Now, as for your generalization, "most"  I'm afraid I find use of either =
word, "most" or "some" to be useless trappings in the thought.  I'd =
rather you'd written: "I don't think poets are team players."  And let =
the thought stand on its own as your point of view. =20

George is entitled to his views on the assertion, offering that he =
thinks at least some are indeed team players, etc. etc. etc. =20

And Anny too is entitled to her feelings that George's response =
appropriately disputes your assertion.  Though I can't help but wonder =
too, if her point of view isn't more on point of definition of the =
phrase, team player, than on the issue of the numbers of people who =
aren't versus the number who are...

In any event, I find I share your point of view...I don't think poets =
are team players, at least not by my definition of the phrase. =20

sense.
>>

In fact you could make the dead opposite point -- Coleridge wrote the
original version of "Dejection: An Ode" (the Letter version, and the one I
much prefer) in response to Wordsworth's "Ode on the Intimations of
Immortality ...", and read it out to the assembled Wordsworth household --
William, Dorothy, Mary Wordsworth and Sarah Hutchinson, and they *all*
promptly went ballistic with fury.

Partly because Coleridge's poem was an explicit rejection of absolutely
*everything* Wordsworth says in the earlier poem, and partly because the
neutral "Dear Lady" of the Ode version is "Dear Sarah" in the Letter version
(and that's the least of the problematic references to Sarah Hutchinson
there -- talk about offence).

It's also, I think, in its own way more radically innovative than anything
Wordsworth ever did, which may have been a further factor adding to the
Household Fury.

So if that's being a team player ...

On the other hand, you could argue that he was a team player in toning it
down for publication.  But given that it wouldn't have been only Wordsworth
and his ladies who would have been out to lynch him if he'd published it as
originally written ...  Seems to me it would have been virtually impossible
to do this anyway in the climate of the early 19thC.

Complicated

Thanks, Alex (if you had written this . . .)

I suppose the metaphor was impertinent and like all metaphors bound to melt
down eventually. In the field of poetics I envision, though obviously with far
 to much innocence for someone my age, that being a team player means being
someone who accepts each player's contribution or self-appointed position and
doesn't dictate to the other players what that should be. All for the good
of the team and all that. Against whom are we competing, ancient poetics? Hell,
 I'll even play switch-hitter if pressed. The rules of what comprises modern
poetics are constantly changing; but human nature isn't, and if "some" people
 enjoy belittling the contribution of other individual players - very well
then. I guess if I can accept some salt and vinegar; they can accept my sugar,
which was once-upon-a-time, geniune, though now obviously saccharine. I've
switched from offense to defense now. Oh dear.

Alex: This is totally opaque. Your own definition would clarify things.

Forget university affiliations. How about "collegiality?" In my experience
poets often form variously cohesive associations (at some moments in the
past they even formed guilds) based on a sense of a degree of shared
practice. Within the groups thus formed they critique each other's work and
also promote it to the outside world (see for example:
Wordsworth-Coleridge, Spicer-Stanley-Blaser, NY School, Beats, Black
Mountain, the Mermaid Tavern, Ficino's circle, but also a myriad of others
that don't have a name.). For most of us it's not the outside world that
counts finally, but the respect of our peers, and our peers begin with our
colleagues. I really don't care what Billy Collins thinks about my work, I
do care what Gabe Gudding, to draw a name out of the hat, thinks about it.

Yes Alan,

As Ron says in one of his earlier blogs, he also always believed in
narrative. Because he prefers to write blogs, lists are beyond him. There are many
things absolutely beyond Ron. In fact narrowness and the unshaking belief in the
superiority of that range (a kind of pre-Copernican bliss) is the defining
quality of his poetry. Within it occasionally wonderful things occur, for
instance, varieties of fart bubbles rising in a bath tub in Zyxt (I was at his last
reading in New York); but as a critic he has become an irrelevancy -for me at
least- the last few years, reminding me of an old soldier telling World War I
stories as if they were happening today.

jim,

Before responding to your comments I checked your web-site
(http://vispo.com). It seems to me what you are doing there -the visual and conceptual elements-
should make you sympathetic to Alan's work.

My sense is that the real argument is between lists and blogs (though yours
is a web-site); their natures and advantages and disadvantages. I believe that
blogs have an inherent tendency towards solipsism, particularly after the
formations of "squawk boxes" (what an awful expression, upstairs/downstairs); on
the other hand, despite innumerable problems associated with them and recently
hashed out here, lists are public places of argument.

For Alan, sending his pieces to lists is an integral part of his work, not
sending for a traditional publication but a step in a performance. David Antin's
"talks" on stage, for example, are not publications, but poetic acts. Talking
to C. Bernstein, Antin distinguished between his "talks" and their published
versions, as parallel acts. I think Alan's work should be seen within the same
framework; the net is his universe and his material, and the lists his
society.

Excess quantity is the big criticism against Alan. When I first joined the
list a few years ago, I also posted a few comments saying that Alan needed to
"edit" his work. I realized gradually that's who Alan (his work) is. One may as
well complain that it is raining too much or inconveniently.

I don't -and I suspect neither do very many others- read or respond to all of
Alan's work. But in the cases when I do, what haunting, mysterious,
intuitive, prophetic presences. He is part of the internet landscape, projectiles,
nutrinos appearing in lists ("a kind of Sondheim-driven silence"); can you imagine
a Sondheim main-page website or a Sondheim blog?

Ciao.

Murat

> Ficino's circle

Actually, Mark, Ficino's circle was in some ways an extreme example of
*anti* collegiality.

A bit of it turned on the vertically-challenged poison dwarf's inability to
write coherent Latin, but the knives were out with a vengeance in Florence
in the 1490s.

If that's collegiality, it was a basic reason you never turned your back on
*anyone*.

        {Oh, maybe Pico trusted Benivienni, but there are always
exceptions.}

Let alone stood in front of them on a subway platform.

I can do you a bit on the conceptual background, but Steve Farmer is sodding
*venomous* on the Neo-Latin issue.

... and that was *before* they got round to burning Savonarola and Bruno.

Angels weep ...

      ... Collegiality, who trusts it?

well said Murat. the metaphor as i see it is to street performances,
being fundamentally humble, raw in the sense of the collision b/t

1. On CNN special report today I learn 50% of Air Force Academy cadets
(future officers) are self-identifying Evangelicals.

2.Other CNN news (as well as other channels) document huge popular anti-US
uprisings in Afghanistan in response to Newsweek's recent article
documenting official reports that Guantanamo interrogators desecrated the
Koran - setting the book on toilets, and even flushing one down the toilet.

3. Is there any American (or other national) poet addressing what appears a
fulfillment of Bush's original post-Sept 11 analysis of American intended
response (revenge) as a rebirth of the Crusades?

I suspect most of us (at least US citizens) on this list live on the margins
of this war - possibly very well informed - but insulated from direct
involvement with its literal manifestations in this country's institutions -
military Pentagon. State Department.  Between our marginalization - in the
body of text, so to speak - the country is being led by a Biblical seeming
leadership bent on consuming us in an ancient Biblical dynamic set on
crusading, vanquishing, etc.

Our immediate isolation from this dynamic, I suspect, is going to ultimately
and inevitable bite us in the butt big time. Unless.

 Is there any MFA program that encourages crossing these boundaries -
investigating and incorporating the news (disclosed or not)?

What will be the Global literary equivalent of William's City, a global
Patterson - if that work can be seen as a model? Or Zukofsky's "A"?

Many friends with whom I talk in this country agree that it feels like the
nation - is dying. A nausea in the air.

Just ruminating here before going to dinner.

I appreciate the sadness in this post, but I was struck by this natural
turn of the latter part of this phrase:

Stephen Vincent wrote:

In such a discussion of militancy, and perhaps, the poetics of
contemporary militancy, the idea of being "in form" seems somehow at
odds with an imagined poetics for those who are contemporary and
anti-militancy. At the same time, to be insulated -- or rather, in the
present tense, to be "in sula" seems more inviting.

I remember Toni Morrison's book, Sula, but I don't really know what
"sula" means. My dictionary says, bird.

  Forget university affiliations. How about "collegiality?" In my =
experience
  poets often form variously cohesive associations (at some moments in =
the
  past they even formed guilds) based on a sense of a degree of shared
  practice. Within the groups thus formed they critique each other's =
work and
  also promote it to the outside world (see for example:
  Wordsworth-Coleridge, Spicer-Stanley-Blaser, NY School, Beats, Black

others

The US playing world cop (and a good article on "disaster capitalism" by
Naomi Klein in recent Nation), and the complete un-newsworthiness of
mainstream media ("journalism," "cable network"), means that English gets,
wherever we live, no news about the world's elsewheres at all -- they're not
in the, uh, our, world. We's creeps to say "as the world creeps" to laugh.
Up on us finally one day! (CIA!) Very little translated into English from
other places describing how other people think, feel, situate. That's
reflected in shapes of the most pastel of this recent decade's poetics (well
it is poetry after all...). Who bought Kongo's paintings anyways (or is the
auction next week??)? I stupidly have thought English was enough; now: many
many MANY languages -- gooooood. Finnegans Wake as "English" as I wants to
give a bird about. Toodloo,

It may be that most poets are individual rather than part of a group or
movement,
but then most poets are not very good.

That is not true. If you would work a little harder at reading what I
wrote, you will see that I said that those
4 poets attended the university at the same time. I did not say that
that attendance made them team players.
There were doubtless many other young poets at Penn at the same time
who never turned out to be anything.

In the case that I mentioned one does not have to do that inferring. I
rather thought that people on this list would have read enough to know
of the relationship between Ez, WCW and HD.

For a decent poet success of his/her work is not likely to be
Acceptance by readers of his/her time.

You'd better make that definition , then. But in any case, don't refer
to my team as a bunch of lunch partners.

Subject:      for the record: Imitation Poetics/solipsism
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Imitation Poetics is a list I started back in 2001 and I still administer.  I started it as a closed list to stay in touch with my poet-friends.  The list is quiet now, but that's not because Alan has driven people away or crap like that.  It's because no one else has been participating and it is because I failed to maintain the beast.

Jim Andrews may not like me or Lester's pink website, but I cannot help but say that the feeling is not mutual: I admire Jim.  Obviously Jim is a truly smart observer, having effectively captured the very essence of ImitaPo and Alan's role therein without a shred of direct experience of the list.  I wish he would share more of his insights, as it's truly remarkable how he can see these things so acutely without the aid of any evidence other than circumstantial.  Like he has a pair of those x-ray vision glasses from the back of a comic book, only these glasses are tuned not to panties but to poets, and these glasses actually work.  But then that's what makes Jim so special.

With such a small group as that of ImitaPo it was essential that from time to time I give it a little push.  Which I did, aggressively, for two years.   And others did as well.   For a brief time it was a fine list.

But then I returned to school and have had no time to tend to the list ever since.  And other people faded as well.

Blogs are indeed part of the reason, the solipsism Murat and I have discussed so many times on line and in person.  But I can't escape the blame by pinning it on blogs.

And Murat I think captures exactly Alan's essential role, as an email poet, the email poet.  Poetry as a form of correspondence.  blogs don't have that same pretense of discussion that lists do, and actively pushing poems via email makes them interactive in an important way; their potentiality is engagement, call-and-response, and so forth.  I can't imagine where my own writing would be without a list-based poetic dialogue I had with Alan from 1999 through 2001 on places like subsub and ubpo.  Those days are gone gone gone, sadly.

The number of members on ImitaPo has dropped to 30.  The only posts these days are from Alan for the most part.  But that's not Alan's fault.  If anything, he's the only reason the list is still barely wheezing.  It at least reminds us that a list community is still there.  And it is.  It is.  Besides, the list is no big deal.

The second annual Carrboro International Poetry Festival, to be held at the=
 Century Center in downtown Carrboro, NC, starts in less than one week, on =
Saturday May 21. Admission is free.

This year's festival, like last year's, will feature 40 poets from  the US,=
 Canada, and Mexico.  The mix of poets includes renowned poets from outside=
 of North Carolina along with some of North Carolina's finest poets, includ=
ing a large contingent from the Triangle.

In the coming days the schedule of readers will be posted to the website. (=
http://carrboropoetryfestival.org/)  All of the poets' biographies are up o=
n the site already.  The festival website also contains all the travel info=
rmation you'll need, from a comprehensive listing of local accomodations to=
 directions and parking maps.   We even have mp3s of readings from last yea=
r's event.

If you are in North Carolina, please keep an eye out for articles about the=
 event in The Chapel Hill News (tomorrow), The Independent (Wednesday), and=
 the Raleigh News & Observer (Friday).

Please come to the festival.  The hundreds that turned out to last year's f=
ree event displayed an enthusiasm about poetry in a way I've frankly never =
seen before.  I've tried my best to make it entertaining, fresh, and surpri=
sing.  I expect to see more of that same energy and excitement, as I have w=
orked to make the festival better--not bigger--but better.

I hope to see you next Saturday.

I am poet who writes allot of "political'work. I have to tell you all that
most venues open to publishing 'experimental'work
are not interested in politics. I have been a finalist for at least five
contests over the past 5-6 years where the editor has sent me a lovely note
saying "we love your innovative work but we don't normally publish
'political'poetry"  What should I write about?

I for one do not understand why this is reality would these editors have
rejected Vallejo, Neruda, Ahkmatova?

Everything that is written is political, sexual and more.

What is more important to write about today?

I hate to be crass but if I have to read another book of experimental poetry
where the poet reflects on bird-watching or Architecture or Chinese
Watercolors I am going to vomit.

Hundreds of thousands of people are dead because no one said anything anyone
listened to,

2000 American soldiers died for nothing,

145,000 Iraqis are dead,

40 million Americans are one hospital visit away from financial ruin,

because of America's love of cheap tee shirts workers in China work 100
hours a week and recently a woman in Guangzhou died at her sewing machine
after 84 hours working without sleep,

there are so many political things that poets should be writing about-
instead however we get the same "politically correct" BS, laments about
'oppression' rather that screams about real injustice

we who are fat and well fed should be talking about politics because it is a
matter of life and death-

and life and death is poetry what poetry should be about....

I can't beliieve NP (and that's not Neurolinguistic Programming) wrote this:

"The fact is that if you are a poet, other poets are the competition. No
poet of any experience or intelligence takes the opinion of other poets all
that seriously, because, unless they are very psychologically disabled, or
not very intelligent, or extremely inexperienced, they have figured this out
by now...Don't get me wrong. There is nothing amiss about liking or enjoying
another poets' work and writing and or blogging about this. But to put
yourself forth as a poetry 'critic', somehow in a position to make objective
judgements about the accomplishment of other contemporary poets when you are
a poet yourself is confused and/or manipulative."--Nick Piombino

I don't know context, haven't read blogs in a bog's age, but found this on
your link to Poozy Galoshes.

It's mental! Creak me OUT. (stale)

DO get me, right: one can only EVER EVAAH trust a poet's biased enrivaled
pinion.  Even critics do. The anxiety of INFluence only applies to critical
writing in fact.

No poet ever writes about another EXcept OBJECTIVELY (without that truth
kernal, the "writing about" is wARTHless) and AS A FOld of _the poet's own
writing_. I mean no big-deal theory of Folds, but there's a successive
ridgework of intercalations out of same spoiled surfaces historydipped.

There's no such positivistic unproblematically neutral self-evident
empirical thing as INdividual poet cept in that poet's own FANtasy.

I read somewhere that Sula, means peace, her name then  meaning Peace Peace.
And well, we know what insular means. If Everyone were  an island, I suppose
we would each be at peace, though alone. I know this  temptation. Sula was a
kind of existentialist, at peace with herself; and as  with much of life,
difficulties arise when we interact with the Other. Which of  course, leads me back
to the team player metaphor and politics and real life.  We're probably all
better people and/or poets when we find a way to be 'in  Company', but some,
even as managers, coaches, or all-star players, tend to  be elitist and
exclusionary, ignoring the walk-ons and real fans. We can often  find ourselves in the
company of one, which still can be quite satisfying,  rather like being a
duffer. Emily Dickinson was no slouch, though an island.  It's only elitism and
racism that cause wars, not poetry. We can stick our heads  in the sand and
leave our asses exposed or get our s/words out and wield them  against the real
enemy. It's just so damned hard for rookies no matter their  age, but its's even
harder on starving, mutilated and murdered children. Mary  Jo

Hass writes: "we who are fat and well fed should be talking about politics
because it is a
matter of life and death - and life and death is poetry what  poetry should
be about....

George writes: "It may be that most poets are individual rather than part  of
a group or
movement, but then most poets are not very good."

Gregory writes: "At the same time, to be insulated -- or rather, in the
present tense, to be "in sula" seems more inviting. I remember Toni Morrison's
book, Sula, but I don't really know what "sula" means. My dictionary says,  bird.

Dear Louis,

I'm somewhat surprised and taken aback by your reaction here
to a few of my comments on some weblogs. You have some
excellent arguments to dispute my point of view, and I am
surely open to having my mind changed about this! I don't
mean these to be my final words on the topic either.

I think you have misunderstood what I was getting at.
No wonder you were surprised to read what you read and
quoted out of context.

First of all, I posted some links to blogs to illustrate my disagreement
with a listee who was claiming that blogs are solipsistic.
I wanted to encourage list readers to read the comments sections
on these blogs, though I realize that there is a lot to read!
There's a wide range of very interesting opinions posted on
the blogs I linked to on the topic of competition and related issues.
Indeed, there are lots of lively discussions posted on blogs now, like this
one -though many readers might enjoy their "solipsistic" aspects also.
Anyway, what you (and Emily Lloyd) quoted was part of an ongoing discussion
on several weblogs over several weeks. I also wrote, in the same
weblog comments section...
**************************
Nick Piombino said...

When I made the point that poets are competitive with one another, I wasn't
saying that they necessarily consciously *feel* or are aware of competitive
feelings towards one another's work. Also, I was not saying such competitive
feelings are wrong or inappropriate. They are human and ordinary. Of course,
I should have pointed out that I was talking about cases when such
competitive feelings are largely unconscious or denied. Also, I was saying
this in the context of Mayhew insisting on the benefits of poets saying and
writing negative things about other poets' work, so-called "reviews."
Mostly, of course, poets consciously support a lot of other poets' work, and
work very hard at succssfully overcoming trends towards competitive
feelings. When poets insist on the benefits of attacking other poets' work,
I start to have the hunch that unconscious feelings of competition are at
work. Isn't it published works, that are usually attacked, awards, poets who
have garnered a lot of publicity, popularity,academic posts, etc?
***************************

In my original statements I was having a discussion with a blogger
who felt that critical reviews of poets were helpful. I  was responding
by saying that because there are issues of competitiveness involved,
how can "reviews" of other poets by poets be read as if they
were reviews by professional critics? I was thinking of issues
having to do with conflict of interest.

I do hope to change your mind about posting on the list; and that
you will take this opportunity to demolish my argument further!

best wishes,
Nick

Nick: I don't much concern myself about blogs because they take more to=ime
to read than I have--I'll wait for the movie version.

But I do want to comment on what you say below. I'm not sure what a
professional critic is and how one becomes qualified for the title. Few who
don't practice the craft, it seemeth me, are equipped to write about poetry
as it concerns practitioners. As a practitioner that kind of insight is
what I look for. It's a question of useful to whom.

Self-ineterst can cloud the issues, but surely some of us are sometimes
capable of recognizing and dealing with it when we write criticism. Not
unlike the various ways a therapist deals with or uses counter-transference.

Nick,

There is difference between poetry and social work, at least in the opinion of this listee.

emperor-fawning latinate epic poets dipped beaks in holy cave water, munched
the bug-clingin fauna and cast eyes about for syllabic teradactyls. Would
someone please find a swell-swearing vocab to use instead of body parts and
acts and then put them all in front of EP's name. Feeble abbreviation for
now from keyboard in front of my eyeballs: tilden EP. That tilden! Complete
utter tildenator. Fresh rime-squeazed tilden of Tilden. I could just
tildenify on the tildice. Pope-squawking evangelical grunt. Unavoidable
inducinizing vomitator - tilden on your tilden forever!

Anyway we reconciled in a dream the other night.

Still.

The title of my blog is Narcissus' Works. Just to give an idea of
where I am, or of how I see things - objectively. There might also be
a positive message somewhere in there to which I would like to add
that I have reached it. If that was the case I would be in bed now,
and today instead of working I would have had a wonderful walk in this
most beautiful spring.

It was Leonardo da Vinci in his Notes who wrote that _competition is
fundamental in art_ if you want to distinguish yourself. And I agree
with him. Again - objectively.

Given the assumption that someone, the one who is still reading,
agrees with me, at this point we should distinguish between the
distinct ways of competing. There is the healthy competition and the
rotten one, with all the hues in-between. A healthy competition can
bring to much, and among this much there is the actual acknowledgement
of the work of the other that might give a great review written by a
good critic.

There are many other cases, I can quote Mark Weiss who is both a poet
and an editor. His competition will forcibly stop in the moment in
which he becomes an editor and will be able to _read_ the text of the
other through different eyes.

Or the attitude of the scholar, if you are able to keep it alive. Or
of the curious, it is intelligent curiosity that keeps you going; and
many others.

Extrapolated texts from discussions are a nuisance for everybody. I
anyhow liked some remarks by Louis Cabri.

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

Home Girls, Make Some Noise!: Hip Hop Feminism Anthology

Feminism, rap music, and Hip Hop culture, at first glance, do not appear to
be likely cohorts. In the male-driven, testosterone filled world of Hip Hop
culture and rap music labeling oneself a feminist is not a political stance
easily taken. Thus, many women involved with Hip Hop culture do not take
on the
label of feminist even as their actions imply feminist beliefs and
leanings. Much
of the strong criticisms of rap music have been about the music's sexism and
misogyny. And much of the attention focused on sex and gender have been in
terms of constructions of Black masculinity, and rap music as a vehicle
for Black
male posturing. A lot of attention has been paid to the impact rap music and
the masculine space of Hip Hop culture has on the development of Black male
identities. In this volume, the editors strive to understand
constructions of
Hip Hop feminism, gender, and sexuality in Hip Hop culture, rap music
and these
in transnational contexts.
We take the stance that Hip Hop is a cultural phenomenon that expands
farther
than rap music. Hip Hop has been defined by many as a way of life that
encompasses everything from way of dress to manner of speech. Hip Hop as
a culture
originally included graffiti writing, d-jaying, break dancing, and rap
music.
It has recently expanded to include genres such as film, spoken word,
autobiographies, literature, journalism, and activism. It has also
expanded enough to
include its own brand of feminism. The work of Hip Hop feminist writers
such as
Ayana Byrd, Denise Cooper, Eisa Davis, Eisa Nefertari Ulen, shani jamilla,
dream hampton, Joan Morgan, Tara Roberts, Kristal Brent-Zook, and Angela
Ards is
expanding black feminist theory and black women's intellectual traditions in
fascinating ways. What started out as a few young black feminist women who
loved Hip Hop and who tried to mesh that love with their feminist/womanist
consciousness is now a rich body of articles, essays, poetry, and creative
non-fiction.
We seek to complicate understandings of Hip Hop as a male space by including
and identifying the women who were always involved with the culture and
offering Hip Hop feminist critiques of the music and the culture. We
seek to explore
Hip Hop as a worldview, as an epistemology grounded in the experiences of
communities of color under advanced capitalism, as a cultural site for
rearticulating identity and sexual politics. We are particularly
interested in seeing
submissions of critical essays and cultural critiques, interviews, creative
non-fiction and personal narratives, fiction, poetry, and artwork. We also
encourage submissions from women working within the Hip Hop sphere, Hip
Hop feminists
and activists "on the ground," as well as scholars, writers, and
journalists. We do not wish to reify the scholar/activist dichotomy, but
we want to
encourage as broad a discussion of the possibilities of Hip Hop Feminism as
possible and we want to be sure multiple voices and perspectives are
represented in
the anthology. All work submitted must be original and should not have been
published elsewhere.
Word Count/Page Limits:
Critical Essays and Cultural Critiques - 25 pages (including bibliography)
6500 words
Interviews - 10 pages/2500 words
Creative Non-Fiction and Personal Narratives - 20 pages/5000 words
Fiction - 20 pages/5000 words
Poetry/Rhymes - No more than 3 pages per poem/rhyme and 3 poems per poet/mc
Artwork - Up to three pieces per artist
Editors:
Gwendolyn Pough is an Associate Professor of Women's Studies, Writing, and
Rhetoric at Syracuse University and the author of Check It While I Wreck It;
Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture and the Public Sphere, Northeastern
University
Press 2004.
Elaine Richardson is an Associate Professor of English at Penn State
University and the author of African American Literacies (2003) and the
forthcoming
Hip Hop Literacies both from Routledge Press.
Rachel Raimist is a Hip Hop feminist filmmaker, scholar and activist. Her
film credits include the award-winning feature length documentaries
Freestyle,
Nobody Knows My Name, and Garbage, Gangsters, and Greed. She is a doctoral
student in Feminist Studies at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.
Aisha S. Durham is an essayist and Editorial Assistant for several cultural
studies journals, including Qualitative Inquiry where her performance
work is
featured. Durham's dissertation research examining Hip Hop feminism will be
featured in an upcoming anthology and documentary about Hip Hop culture.
She is a
doctoral candidate in the Institute of Communications Research at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Additional themes to be explored:
- Has Hip Hop feminism moved beyond the conflicted stance of loving Hip Hop,
being a feminist, and meshing the two? What is next? What should Hip Hop
feminism be doing?
-Now that we have at least two generations of women who identify as Hip Hop
feminist, can we talk about multiple Hip Hop feminism(s), multiple Hip Hop
feminist agendas?
-On that generational note, how then does the Hip Hop feminist agenda mesh
with the Black feminist agenda or womanist agenda of our predecessors and
contemporaries who do not claim a Hip Hop sensibility?
-We know that there are dedicated educators out there who are working in the
trenches with no institutional support to bring feminist education and
issues
of sexuality, sexual health, and emotional well-being to our youth, but how
can Hip Hop feminists work to ensure that feminist education is centered
in the
curricula of America's schools, elementary through college for both male and
female students?
-What are the defining contours of Hip Hop Feminism? If we are of the
understanding that a Hip Hop feminist is more than just a woman who
loves Hip Hop and
feels conflicted about it, what does a Hip Hop feminism look like?
-The continued sexual labor of women of color in a global market place now
depending on virtual "mass mediated" sex labor (e.g. music video and
pornography) as well as other forms of sex and gendered labor performed
by women of color
still policed.
i-s Hip Hop feminism simply a US phenomenon? Should Hip Hop feminism have a
global agenda? And how should Hip Hop feminism participate in the agendas of
transnational feminism(s)?
-What roles can Hip Hop feminism play in combating growing rate of
incarcerated woman of color and the expanding prison industrial complex?

Murat,

I appreciate your making this point to me which is well put and I agree- and
I greatly value the differences.

Since I've been very active in both fields- poetry and social work
(psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, as well) for over 40 years, I am more
than ever struck by how much each has to offer the other; at least in terms
of the frequently encountered desire for personal and social transformation
that I have noted among the practitioners in both fields. For example,
both psychoanalysis and poetry share foundational values concerning the
power of spontaneous speech and verbalization in searching for and assisting
transformation, values that have an obvious political and social dimension
as well.

But clearly, I need to think much more about how to explain what I feel I
have understood and might have to say about some of these things before I
say anything more about it in this context.

Nick

Thanks to Mark and Anny for your responses to my posts.

Dear Nick,

Thanks very much for helping me understand the context of your excerpted
post on blogs and on the question of whether blogs are solipsistic,
narcissistic. I really don't have a reasoned opinion on the subject. What is
solipsism anyway? Doesn't it only have a strictly philosophical definition?
Sounds less promising than narcisism, but which is alsoused more loosely,
even as I'm sure that you had a psycho-technical definition in mind as well
(if, that is, you were the one who suggested that word; I don't know). In
any case, your post made me realize I completely misunderstood your point,
as you rightly suggest. Your explanation has the subtlety and complication
I've always associated with your writing and thinking.

All I can think of adding is that I think a list admits negativity into it
(so long as that negativity is permitted by the adminstrs) because of its
captive audience format (not because of the quality of the negative post -
viz mine). Blogs on the other hand impose an order of friendliness and even
demand a certain stylistic decorousness in writing manner (the need to
create such a style for onself) simply because a blogger has no captive
audience and has but to be, to an extent, "earned." I don't think such
seemliness is self-regarding in a limiting way.

The blog community is actually quite salon-like and can have its captivating
moments even for a "lurker," although after awhile, if one is not oneself a
participant, I feel it can also be a little cloying. That's been my limited
experience from some time ago, and who knows what it feel like now.

I misunderstood your excerpted post to suggest that poets couldn't provide a
critical framework for understanding their verbal, and otherwise, actions as
poets, that poets were doomed to a sociological, theoretical, historical
ignorance of their behaviours as social animals - sort of like Bourdieu 19C
Paris literati.

Thanks very much for encouraging me to post more often. It's just not
possible for me right now, and the reasons have nothing to do with blogs,
listervs, etc. I wish too I could read all this stuff more often than I am
able; that will hopefully change.

Unrelatedly to any of this, I've been re-reading a lot of Pound lately,
letters, WWII stuff, 30s stuff, it's enough to turn a phrase into a
hair-raisingly awful experience, and I've been struggling with that on
various levels (if you allow me to be nice and be vague about it). The
thanks I get is him visiting me in a dream! A grudging visit, anyway, which
amused me. It's best to keep a very cool head reading Pound. I let it go
here for a bit. Probably best way is Mac Low's.

and best wishes on your work!
Louis

i don't know if poetry is a correspondence... if it's a kind of journalistic
correspondence then perhaps it's just that, which is rarely poetry... blogs,
by my definition, are simple records, although some extend further...
pushing my work on a continual basis in e-mail is akin to drubbing you over
the head with it... like my upstairs neighbors who, while refnishing their
apartment, make a great deal of noise... occasionally, there are random
rhythmic hammerings or other unidentifiable sounds which strike me as
musical and give me pause... that's not exactly interactive... you might
even be less likely to read a daily flood of it... of course, i'm not
against one's experiments...

something has happened to that word _pushing_ since Patrick used it

amd you are not using it with quite the same meaning

the shift, which is subtle, is hard to define; but, in your meaning, it
seems to me, the use of "pushing" in "pushing my work" prejudges the
conclusion you claim to be reaching

and you have added your own "on a continual basis", followed by an
illegitimate comparison (there being no filtering / reditrection available
to deal with noisy neighbours)

I agree and look forward to seeing how you will expand on this. Language
reflects and affects our entanglement with others. Some prefer the intense
dynamic of personal conversational communication; and others eschew interaction,
preferring their work to speak for itself. And of course, there are all kinds
of  in-betweens, determined by our personal philosophy which has been affected
by  language and which in turn reflects our shared values.

Nick said: "For example, both psychoanalysis and poetry share foundational
values concerning the power of spontaneous speech and verbalization in
searching  for and assisting
transformation, values that have an obvious political and  social dimension
as well."

And just for the record, I present my work on syndicate - and it's had no
effect on postings (which have always been low). And on wryting and
Cybermind - and it's had no effect on postings (which have always been
high).

At this point the latter two lists are running with a lot more energy than
poetics. And anyone who wants to post daily is welcome to. And nobody is
up in arms about it one way or another. We're just interested in what
people write.

Dear Louis,

Thanks for this; our brief crossfire led to some useful explications. I, for
one, certainly look forward to the moment when your schedule might permit
time for you to post further updates here re: your literary activities and
research, or on whatever interests you. Your expository style is direct,
probing, lucid, and very absorbing; I want more. I enjoyed your mysterious
poetic/poetics prose works recently posted here also.

best wishes,
Nick

I am not going to waste my time trying to respond to this outfit
any more. If I send a second message in a day, even after sending none
for a week,
I will get it rejected, for the declared reason that we are restricted
to two
a day. Apparently for me, or is it for all foreigners, two means one.

Or it will be rejected for having an attachment, even though I never
send attachments.
If I type the whole thing out again and try to send,
it will be rejected as an attachment, though it is only my typing.
Even without any italics or the like.

I have decided that the list is too unfriendly in this way to make all
this
annoyance worth it.

The amount of feeling poets have about Silliman is always
an amazing thing to behold!

I mean, hey, go ahead, I'm not stopping you, and I don't
think he will try to either, let it flow red as you can.

But about the man's poems!  Have you read WOUNDWOOD?
It's a knockdown fight!  Beautiful, blogs and other things  aside,
the man can write, and I mean REALLY fucking write!

It's nice to read a poet his age and see that he's not only NOT
slowed down, but coming into the real magic!  He rocks the room!

Not too long ago I heard him read from his latest, and last of
the alphabet series.  Shit, what's it called now?  I don't  know
what it's called, but hearing it made me revved to see it printed.
It was very much (I'm fucking serious here) like hearing a band
and you LOVE the music, and the CD's not out yet.  You try
to keep the tune in mind the following days, but know the CD
is coming, and when it does, you'll have the beauty again.

But let me say this...
Silliman is ESSENTIAL to the growth of poetry RIGHT NOW!
Hey, he's one of the few old guys out there who lights the
kind of fires that get everyone freaking out on the Buff List.

Silliman is the BEST of all those incredible bonfire stories of
poets like Duncan and Spicer YELLING at the young poets
on stage!  Getting everyone fuming and active, fully active!

You don't have to agree with everything, I certainly don't agree
with everything he says.  The friction of disagreement can
give us all so much in the end.

Nick, you might very well be in a minority when it comes to enjoying a post
in which Pound is refered to as a master idiot.

Craig, I think Silliman gets in blog trouble at times because he's one of
the very few opinionated poetry blogsters who doesn't construct a
personality for his commentary and for his blog. His writing-register is to
try to keep affect and expression to a minimum - definitely personality to a
minimum. This isn't intended as a slight by any means. Of course he has
pers-on-ality, as the song says. But I mean without the affective-personal
hook for a judgment-call on poetry, it seems that the judgment just hangs
there in so-called objective "space," and one is uncertain finally
(paradoxically) what kind of evaluation it is exactly - is he saying yes, or
is he saying no to this text? Something is asserted, but which way does it
point?

Nick, this question of personality construction relates to what is
distinctive about blogs that I already mentioned - their personalities. I
don't know if they're a whole lot individuated, however; and in my distant
memory of reading them, they did seem to share a personality-construct in a
way; perhaps they aspired to (if one wanted to be a little mischievous in
describing them) an identical I-function in some way without knowing it? A
lot of that blog life at same time is grounded in regional affiliation,
going to each other's readings etc., which can reinforce implicit sense of
shared I-dentity.

Thinking about this some more, I must be mostly referring to the formal
intersubjective aspects of blogs when suggesting that they have a shared
character (affect, etc.), in other words to the material that indicates that
blogs aren't necessarily, as you wanted to argue by posting those links,
narcissistic well-holes into which a reader sees infinity reflected back as
cliche.

Oh hell, one more post.

George, don't leave.

Louis,

I didn't mean to imply that blogs are "narcissistic well-holes into which a
reader sees infinity reflected back as cliche" as you put it, though I must
say I do enjoy the ring of the phrase! On the contrary: I was trying to
illustrate that some blogs are demonstrably not solipsistic- by linking to
the wellspring of commentary that has emerged on many blogs, of late,
including Ron Silliman's, commentary and discussions that might rival in
quality and intensity any seen recently on this list.

I was struck, not long ago, by the synergy that seemed to spontaneously
occur by means of a passing interest on the part of Gary Sulllivan who
simply asked not long ago, on his blog, and here on the list, for some
"brushes with fame"- anecdotes that listees and bloggers happily
provided about their brief meetings with famous people. For a few sunny,
magical days list and blogs meshed their enthusiasms. Gary
had to actually put the idea to sleep after a week- I think it might
have gone on forever if he hadn't. Gary Sullivan's *Elsewhere* is an example
of the emanation of a blog persona that is identifiable and consistent. As
was discussed on Jonathan Mayhew's *Bemsha Swing*, the conversation that led
to the comments that I made that you objected to, so very much in need of
further clarification and elaboration, there is an overall aesthetic of
basic mutual respect and consideration on blogs, that might result partly in
an ongoing awareness that every time a name is typed in on a blog, the
comments are permanently registered on the Google site of the person named.
Html linking results in quite a lot of care, it seems, in the statements
bloggers make about other people. I know that, for a time, Google considered
not providing link records to comments made on blogs; but then they decided
to include blog comments on the Google sites. Not every search engine does
this, by they way. Much more could be said about blog personas;
it is a topic I have thought about a lot, but haven't yet tried to
articulate as you have. I did mention to someone recently that I have
the feeling that I read blogs not essentially for their content, but for
the voice "texture" so to speak of the blogger.  I realize now, after more
than two years, I read them the way you would listen to a radio show, to
enjoy the tone of voice, attitude, humor, in short their "personalities", as
much as their content, or as an important aspect of their "angle" on the
content. And though conversation is an aspect of the interaction among the
blogs, each stand on their own, not so much in a solipsistic  or
narcissistic way, though self-reflections are an aspect of what they
sometimes talk about, but  again,more like radio personalities or stand-up
comics. I still don't think I'm getting at the essence of the thing. But as
Henry Gould put it recently when he started back his blog after quitting for
awhile: "I love this medium."

As for Ezra Pound- he is among the very few poets that- despite
the originality and great beauty of many of his poems- I find it difficult,
nearly impossible, in fact, to read his work due to the inhumanity of his
political pronouncements.

The Smell of Oranges

My mother would ask
if I wanted them cut or peeled.
I'd answer that I wanted them peeled
if only to see her fingers hold them
like clay to be molded.
After peeling their husk,
she would put her thumbs in the centre
and break each into halves;
Later separate the slices, one by one.

I marvel at the flexible skins
pulling away,
not ever breaking at the pressure.

The Apt Word


To write modernism is to write in voiceless voice.
To write in voiceless voice is an enunciation.
The enunciated is always pronounced.
This is based on the apt word.
Whatever I write, there is the apt word.
In terms of cleverness, the reader desires this, the apt word.
The apt word makes one famous, i.e. on the road to fame.
Apt may be an apt word.
Writing this style is always a well-honed craft.
I try to procure your agreement or perhaps disagreement.
My taste is apparent on the page.
I am an expert in the use of words and their exactitude.
More specifically, the apt words.
Every phrase, every poem, is a composition.
The poet works hard at the composition, every word must fit.
The fit word is the apt word, both harmonious and perfect.
A poet claws its way to the apt word and beyond.
There is light on the other side of the apt word.
The apt word must not appear contrived.
Or it must appear contrived as a collusion between reader and writer.
The apt word must be secretly clever.

The audience knows the poet by the apt word.
Every poet has a different approach to the apt word.
And every poet has a different approach to the rest of it.
But it is all carefully crafted and that is why we care about poets.
And it is beautifully written and full of surprises.
And that is why we care about poetry.
I am serious about this, this apt word.
It is a well-turned phrase that contributes to the whole.
In a sense it is the whole.
Love language, love the apt, advertising and poetry pick and choose.
Here I am writing, searching for the perfect form.
Oh there must be more to this than that, there is not.
My words are perhaps not apt enough.
My turns of phrase...

I think you put a bit too much faith in the cult of
the author.  In this case, the cult of the poet.  If
the word is apt, most times not in the manner that the
poet intended.

Work.  Labor.  Endeavor all you like.  I do the same.


But as enamoured with myself as I am, I recognize how
precious little I have to do with the reception of my
work.  And for certain, no audience knows me by any
word, turn of phrase, or gathering of such.

I think most poets would do best to regard their work
as unfaithful lovers.  I struggle for my poetry,
sacrifice for it, love it and hate it in the same
suffocating moment...and together we are beautiful.
But come along another mind and I have no power to
stop my work from giving itself wholly away.  I have
no power over what promises it makes.  I have no power
over what cheap thrills it does or does not give.  I
definitely cannot step in the paramour's way and beg,
"if I cannot stop this, at least see it how I see it!"
 S/he sees it however their filthy mind chooses.

And I keep a healthy distance in order to effect only
what I can.

The very act of writing poetry is political in a society in which true literacy is losing out to media hypnosis.  Nevertheless, not all politics is poetry.  A work may be correct, politically, as opposed to "politically correct", and still not be very good poetry.  I'm not speaking of your poetry, sir, since I haven't read it.  But, as a matter of record, I tend to skip the political messages on this list.  I tend to agree with them so why bother?  Not always, of course, but in the blitz of hundreds of messages, I choose where to spend my limited computer time.  Also, there is the question of the efficacy of political poetry.  Has a poem ever changed anything in the so-called real world of politics?  Mostly, if not definitely not.  Nevertheless, I too, write political poetry occasionally, most recently a poem about a woman electrocuted by a misinsulated wire in a New York street just published by Hanging Loose magazine.  In that case, I didn't want this example of monopoly co
rruption
 to be forgotten.  But I don't see the point in writing about George W. Bush.  One way or another, we're stuck with him for the remainder of his term.  There also is the preaching-to-the-converted problem.

saying "we love your innovative work but we don't normally publish

I for one do not understand why this is reality would these editors have
rejected Vallejo, Neruda, Ahkmatova?

Everything that is written is political, sexual and more.

What is more important to write about today?

I hate to be crass but if I have to read another book of experimental poetry
where the poet reflects on bird-watching or Architecture or Chinese
Watercolors I am going to vomit.

Hundreds of thousands of people are dead because no one said anything anyone

2000 American soldiers died for nothing,

145,000 Iraqis are dead,

40 million Americans are one hospital visit away from financial ruin,

because of America's love of cheap tee shirts workers in China work 100
hours a week and recently a woman in Guangzhou died at her sewing machine
after 84 hours working without sleep,

there are so many political things that poets should be writing about-
instead however we get the same "politically correct" BS, laments about
'oppression' rather that screams about real injustice

we who are fat and well fed should be talking about politics because it is a
matter of life and death-

and life and death is poetry what poetry should be about....

I wrote a few political poems at University -- most based around my
experience working in Puerto Rico -- and as a consequence was invited to
read during an Amnesty International event. It included a letter writing
campaign, which sort of bled over into the reading, so that people were
scratching out letters to prisoners of conscience while we were blathering
on. Quite an experience, sort of like words of different classes
organizing into a socialist republic or something.

I tend to agree with Thomas that simply reading or writing deeply is a
political act. Is this a cop out? I don't think so. We don't legislate in
blank verse, nor do we (anymore) get our news that way. It's just the
nature of the beast. At the same time we are deluged with phony "poems" in
picturebook form -- so promoting and engaging in real, essential reading,
suspending the mind in that sea really does seem like it affects the
world. Just in the way one lives, interacts with people, the way in which
being a good reader of poetry makes one that much more able to respond *in
other ways*.

Best political writing by far in the last few months has been for me
Juliana Spahr's this connection of everyone with lungs (everybody?) Really
fantastic Whitmanian stuff. Anyone want to talk about that. Phew.

Maybe Haas could post some of his political poetry. I'm with Thomas that I
tend to avoid the more overtly political work because I often find it
amateurish and didactical. Poetry is all about fighting the (nearest
neighbour) man; not the best vehicle for mobalization.

Two recent reviews of my comic, Elsewhere, have been published in:

dbqp (by Geof Huth)

http://dbqp.blogspot.com

and

The Comics Reporter (by Tom Spurgeon)

http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/briefings/cr_reviews/1488/

They are very different takes. Geof, of course, is a visual poet, and comes
at the book with that sensibility--it's a fairly long review with some close
reading and a sample page--whereas Spurgeon is a professional comics critic
and reads the book with more of a "comics tradition" set of expectations and
assumptions.

You can still get the book using PayPal from my Web site:

http://garysullivan.blogspot.com

It will also be available soon (in a week or two) at:

and for those in the U.K. (in about a month) at:

Retailers, if there are any on this list, can get the book from FM

My radio program "Word Soundings" on Sunday night was delayed due to a
scheduled interview that went on longer than expected. The program started
at 9:00 instead of 8:15 . . . I hope this didn't cause anyone trying to
tune in to think that it was canceled. To make up for the time lost from
that program, I'll be doing another this coming Sunday, 8-10.

The main focus of the third part will be musicians and composers who
collaborate with poets.

Nick, I forgot to add an "also" in: "as you [also] wanted to argue by
posting those links." I realize that you did not think blogs were
narcissistic well-holes. I agree with you that texture or tone or
"personality" seems to be an identifying marker of a blog. A semiotics could
be done of blog personality. Who hasn't listened to, momentarily transfixed
by just the tone of a radio station host. The analogy to a radio station
host seems so apt, to me.

Alan, apt word suggests to me a word that is suitable, predisposed to mean
what it does in the way it is used, prepared in advance to mean and be in
that particular way. So, I _recognize_ in my own experience Nick's analogy
to radio station. It seems fitting to what I have already experienced.

What are poetry examples of apt words, I wonder. Pound's Confucius, maybe,
where apt word suggests a static world of unchanging value, no surprise that
does not have an apt word waiting to articulate that surprise back into a
pre-established custom or experience.

Now isn't condensed word conventional modernism? "To write is to condense"
seems to go in a qualitatively different direction from "apt word."

Apt word also suggests - and in a register altogether otherwise than the
meanings for apt mentioned above (ie: suitable, predisposed, prepared) -
right timing.

Regarding the ways in which poetry might engage politics: I'd like to repeat=
 my
call for poems for the series in which, beginning August 24, we'll post to t=
he
Web, for 440 days, one poem each day that includes the name of one of the 44=
0
members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 109th Congress.  Outstanding p=
oets
who have so far sent or promised work are Steve Benson, Lee Ann Brown, Julia=

Cohen (whose excellent recent poem in How2 should be read by all), Catherine=

Daly, Brandon Downing, Jenny Factor, Daisy Fried, Lyn Hejinian, Sueyeun Juli=
ette
Lee, Joyelle McSweeney, Ange Mlinko, Carol Szamatowicz, and Sara Veglahn, al=
ong
with many others.  We still need poems.  Request guidelines from me at
boydspahr.carafe@bluetie.com.

Thanks (and thanks especially to those of you who have sent poems),
Boyd Spahr

Alan,

This is stirring.

Still, I rarely discover what I'm looking for-
or find that it comes to me-
until I stop thinking about it.

The Word Apt

I once knew a woman who hated the song, "Come On Eileen"
because she read it "the wrong way" (like jazzm)
and Samuel Johnson called the pun Shakespeare's "fatal cleopatra"
(which may not be so bad if your only other option
is the Roman "honor" of cut throat "Caesar), but still
When I think of the apt word, I think of the word "apt"
And all of us who live in them, and don't even "have"
A complex. How apt. the voiceless voice. The asp word?
The baby at my breast, sucking me to death? Apt apt.
Mot Juste. Just moat, can you draw a bridge? Tis Paltry
To be Caesar, dear landlord. The various properties.
Do you fit in your apt? Can you afford a storage space?
Here I am writing, piling boxes and boxes of papers
I can't afford to keep. Once, while moving from apt to apt,
I threw a whole box of them (1986) away. I kind of regret
it now. Another time, I threw many boxes of books away.
How apt, this economy, of words. Of course, one will say,
you could save it all, today, to disk. But how much time
does that take? And time is money? And money grows
on cut-down trees I will never a poem as lovely as.
How apt. Looking good on paper, while voices grow
voiceless, and throats scarred by beautiful abstraction.
What doth your body say about the apt? In my apt
there are many mansions. Maybe even Charles Mansion,
ever cell he saw. Bernadette Mayer lamented the lack
of farm, but at least her apt had rent control.
The word is ours to rent, but that doesn't mean we'll
even get our security deposit back, especially because
they're very good at blaming you for a scratch
the previous tenant caused. This to, a world, to rent
a tent, is apt.

>> To write modernism is to write in voiceless voice.
>> To write in voiceless voice is an enunciation.

>> I am serious about this, this apt word.
>> It is a well-turned phrase that contributes to the whole.
>> In a sense it is the whole.
>> Love language, love the apt, advertising and poetry pick and choose.
>> Here I am writing, searching for the perfect form.
>> Oh there must be more to this than that, there is not.
>> My words are perhaps not apt enough.

check out the new issue of  <http://www.moriapoetry.com> moria
(www.moriapoetry.com). it includes poetry by kari edwards, chuck stebelton,
mIEKAL aND, vincent blafard, mark kanak, jennifer firestone, john dooly,
andrew cliburn, dennis formento, christopher eaton; a collaborative piece by
steve dalachinsky and jukka-pekka <http://nonlinearpoetry.blogspot.com>
kervinen; a theoretical piece by eileen tabios
<http://chatelaine-poet.blogspot.com> ; and reviews on derek white and wendy
sorin, donna kuhn, catherine daly, raymond bianchi, thomas fink, and  the
book pinoy poetics.



as usual i'm looking for exciting experimental poetry for the next issues.
i'm especially interested in mixed media work.  i have a streaming server at
my disposal and can accommodate many types of work broadly defined as
poetic, so feel free to send me whatever you can manage to create.



i'm also especially interested in hosting more theoretical pieces on the
nature of contemporary poetry/poetics.

counting spiders/bots) from 54 countries already in may.

I'm planning a online residency at netbehavour http://www.netbehaviour.org/ and need contributions from other ent artists. The details are below, but back channel me with your information.
So please do CONTRIBUTE
Not sure how many migrated back to the netbehavour list. But those that have joined back in, might be interested in taking part with my proposed residency. As I said long ago, I will be creating small digital creatures inspired by people on this list. I am imagining 24 total..Two each day. Maybe more.

But what I need are people to volunteer images, text, sounds and the like of their work or of them I prefer those personal notes and family pictures. Then I will make a creation about you, on you, over you.

If you respond to this back channel I will be sure to include you...and if I don't get enough then I'll find what I can on the net and blast away.
So again CONTRIBUTE!!!!!!

I just received my copy of Uncertain Poetries by Michael Heller, a =
sumptuous collection of his essays, in the mail. I urge people to read =
this book. Heller is not only one of our finest poets; he is also one of =
our best thinkers and prose writers, someone for whom thought is =
aesthetic.

=20

The essays cover, among others, Pound, Stevens, Moore, Oppen, Duncan, =
Niedecker, Bronk, Ignatow, Schwerner, Lorca, Rilke, Mallarme. Other =
essays cover topics rather than poets, such as "The Poetics of =
Unspeakability," "Avant-Garde Propellants of the Machine Made of Words," =
and "Diasporic Poetics."

If you don't know Salt publishers, who did this amazing book, then you =

Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did, you would know him. And if you knew him, you would know why we must honor him: Malcolm was our manhood, our living, black manhood!--ossie davis



"We have a common enemy. We have this in common: We have a common oppressor, a common exploiter, and a common discriminator. But once we all realize that we have this common enemy, then we unite on the basis of what we have in common. And what we have foremost in common is that enemy..."-- Malcolm X: "Message To The Grass Roots"

from 'message to the grassroots

"We all agree tonight, all of the speakers have agreed, that America has a very serious problem. Not only does America have a very serious problem, but our people have a very serious problem. America's problem is us. We're her problem. The only reason she has a problem is she doesn't want us here. And every time you look at yourself, be you black, brown, red, or yellow -- a so-called Negro -- you represent a person who poses such a serious problem for America because you're not wanted."

"I would like to make a few comments concerning the difference between the black revolution and the Negro revolution. There's a difference. Are they both the same? And if they're not, what is the difference? What is the difference between a black revolution and a Negro revolution? First, what is a revolution? Sometimes I'm inclined to believe that many of our people are using this word "revolution" loosely, without taking careful consideration [of] what this word actually means, and what its historic characteristics are. When you study the historic nature of revolutions, the motive of a revolution, the objective of a revolution, and the result of a revolution, and the methods used in a revolution, you may change words. You may devise another program. You may change your goal and you may change your mind."

"If violence is wrong in America, violence is wrong abroad. If it's wrong to be violent defending black women and black children and black babies and black men, then it's wrong for America to draft us and make us violent abroad in defense of her. And if it is right for America to draft us, and teach us how to be violent in defense of her, then it is right for you and me to do whatever is necessary to defend our own people right here in this country."

I had problems at first. Make sure that the subscription request is sent
plain text, rather than html/ rich text. And of  course, the message is in
the message body without, as the message below says, the quotation marks or
the square brackets.

stated. The "whole" may be considered similar to the sight of two
parallel lines that, by definition, cannot intersect. A Yoku is related to,
but not to be confused with a metaphysical conceit in which opposites are
violently yoked together into an artificial coherence to compel an intended
"conceit", that is an enforced imposition of implied or directly stated
meaning, ironic or otherwise. A Yoku is also related to a Haiku, but

Since his "rediscovery" last year in Fulcrum 3 (The Berkeley Renaissance),
Landis has been writing poetry again after four decades of silence.  A lot of
poetry.  Besides those which appeared in the Landis Everson feature in Jacket
26, and his appearance in April's issue of Poetry, Landis has new poems out this
week in the New Republic (May 16) and LIT 10.  Look out for a large selection
of his new work (and letters to Spicer and Duncan which have surfaced)
forthcoming in Fulcrum 4 (end of August).

For those of us who are older...
how many of you feel the pull..


like a dark current...
or a black magnet....

a welcome tug back
hello/good bye....

or is  it like a whirlpool
caught goin' round...

this is not a poem
no one will read it...

this is not a life
no one will remember it

this is not a question
no one will answer it

the scar on my arm
from the childhood dog bite

i must have lived
this must have been me

the child boy man
old codger

with a gleam in his eye
beauty pulls fw:

and the backside
tatoo points down

either hole
is home

a warm place
shit or piss

does it matter
bitter or sweet

the taste of each
is a long dream

towards home
i've never lived

condo or rent
what we own

is the memory
we forgot

po is a discussion
with death

that time wins

odds on the ace

spades hearts...



the 1 that was..drn...

there is no itinerary more complex
than navigating a social sphere
a random collection of scrapbooks
reveals the daze you've been in

I wait for your door to be open
I wait for the night to delude me

with small optimistic narratives
created for the illusion of control

from I am Trying to be a Good Horse:

This was before our descent
into winter, when I believed
the world would freeze me forever
for secretly believing I could be satisfied
forever without fiery ropes
dredging my shoulders nightly,
that boiling water was a physical change but
making toast chemical and irreversible,
yet possible everyday.

What's this all about?

Poetry Center Statement Regarding the Cancelled Jill Scott Poetry Reading
that was to be held May 9, 2005.


The Poetry Center deeply regrets the cancellation of the Jill Scott poetry
reading scheduled for Wednesday, May 9th.

Refunds were issued to everyone who purchased tickets. The refund from
TicketWeb will appear on the purchaser's next credit statement.

This event was arranged in March by The Poetry Center at the request and
with the support of St. Martin's Press, publisher of Ms. Scott's book,
"The Moments, The Minutes, The Hours." The Poetry Center was delighted to
be featuring a singer/songwriter who began her career as a poet.

All event details, including the cover charge, were approved by St.
Martin's far in advance, and tickets were placed on sale via TicketWeb.com
a month prior to the event. Tickets were sold to cover the cost of
hosting, marketing and producing the event.

More than 800 people were expected at the event. The Poetry Center
distributed 250 free tickets, as was requested by St. Martin's Press. At
4:30 p.m. on the day of the reading St. Martin's Press informed The Poetry
Center that Ms. Scott was canceling her participation. The Poetry Center
did everything it could to salvage the reading, even offering to refund
all ticket sales in the hopes that Ms. Scott would honor her commitment to
her fans. In addition, St. Martin's Press offered to provide The Poetry
Center enough of her books to give to everyone who purchased a ticket.
Both offers were declined by Ms. Scott's management at 5:30 p.m., the time
when doors were scheduled to open.

The Poetry Center's Reading Series has presented over 400 readings in its
32 year history - including Nobel Laureates, Pulitzer Prize Winners, U.S.
Poet Laureates and other highly renowned artists. Ms. Scott's last minute
cancellation was the first The Poetry Center has experienced.

The Poetry Center is a 501 (c) (3) not for profit organization in
residence at The School of the Art Institute. The organization is
dedicated to promoting and developing the public's interest in poetry and
to providing poets professional opportunities. In addition to its famous
Reading Series, it operates "Hands on Stanzas," a poets in residence
program in inner city public schools. "Hands on Stanzas" has served 60,000
students through classroom teaching and special projects, 81% of which are
from low income families and represent the city's underserved communities.
The program has employed scores of poets as contract employees.

Louis - you should submit this one to the Yuko Home Office in China. I hear
they are going to be sponsoring a Yuko Olympics in 2008 and are looking for
world class entries from different countries. Unfortunately my attempt was
rejected and I threw away the Office email address. But it is accessible on
Google - tho I could not figure out if the office was a branch within or
outside the Manga Office. I suspect if you checked in with Kent Johnson he
can give you the particulars.
Yuko On!

Legendary Singer, Songwriter, Playwright, Oscar Brown, Jr. Hospitalized


Industry attorney Jon Waxman reports to us that Chicago native,
legendary singer/songwriter, playwright, and true American musical
treasure, Oscar Brown, Jr., is in intensive care at St. Joseph Hospital
in Chicago.  The 78-year-old veteran entertainer was recently admitted
to the medical facility in severe pain and reportedly has suffered
paralysis to both of his legs.  Brown underwent successful 14-hour
emergency surgery on Monday, May 16th to stop the spread of an infection
in his lower spine.  He is presently listed in stable condition
recovering from the surgery, however, his prognosis remains uncertain as
of this time.

Oscar Brown, Jr. is hailed as a cultural icon and Civil Rights activist,
noted for his classic compositions including, The Snake, Signifyin'
Monkey and his lyrics for Miles Davis' All Blues, Bobby Timmons' 'Dat
'Dere, and Nat Adderley's, Work Song. Early in Brown's career, he hosted
Steve Allen's Jazz Scene USA and the PBS series >From Jump Street/The
History of Black Music.  Brown has mentored several aspiring young
performers and in 1968 hosted a Gary, Indiana talent show that led to
his discovery of The Jackson Five and singer/actor Avery Brooks.  In
1969, Brown is credited for rewriting the comedy production Big Time
Buck White, and his musical version of the show was presented on
Broadway, featuring former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali in the lead
role.

  The Brown family requests "Prayers" from his Global family at this
time and will provide a formal statement following his recovery period.
For information about Mr. Brown and to send to him any personal messages
you may have, please visit his web site at http://www.oscarbrownjr.com,
which will also accept messages for Oscar.  Good wishes from all of you
will go a long way to help aid in his recovery.

Two Announcements:
1. Shearsman Books (England) has just announced the publication of
*Triggers*, a new book of my poems. Go to:
http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/ebooks/ebooks_home.html
A sample:
      *
Ascend and dive
and don't tell me a thing
I've got a good love on the loose

A wet madrone, skin pealing, its bone bare trunk

Never stop for thought,
especially when the going's good

She's inside me, then out,
tactile as a banana or something to munch

Spasms spring tender illuminations
mauve and pink -

I am a young man now and a young man then:
Live live live

***
Access & enjoy!

2. I will be reading with an all-star local cast of poets this Saturday
evening in San Francisco at the Lab at the first in a series of four in the
now annual Bay Area Poetry Marathon summer readings. It will be good to see
you, if you are in the area.
The details:

This form is sort of like the Americanized ghazal (which is most simply a series of disconnected
couplets, as opposed to traditional ghazals, which have specific rhyme and repetition patterns)
only by line instead of stanza.  Both forms are quite handy when you're trying to steal writing
time at work, as they can be written quickly and then assembled into larger structures at leisure,
when your boss won't drop by and ask why that report isn't finished.  Any other
forms/structures/strategies to recommend when you want to write at work?

Poetry is being ruined by establishment - festival chief

Richard Jinman
Saturday March 19, 2005
The Guardian

British poetry has become almost irrelevant, because the establishment
has closed ranks against fresh ideas and forms, the director of an
experiment called Text Festival said yesterday.

"[It] has run out of steam," Tony Trehy said. "There's nowhere for it
to go other than becoming a mild entertainment or an anachronism."

Mr Trehy describes the festival, which opens today in Bury, Greater
Manchester, as a declaration of war against the poetry establishment.

He hopes it will change the staid image of the poet by giving a stage
to poets who mix text with everything from music, dance and mime to
graphic design and mathematics.

"If people come expecting a [conventional] poetry reading they will go
away having had a much more exciting experience," he said.

"If establishment figures like Simon Armitage or Carol Ann Duffy are
judging a competition, you know what kind of result you're going to
get," he said.

"There's real excitement about the Turner Prize, but who cares who wins
the TS Eliot prize nowadays? The dead hand of the British poetry
establishment means more challenging and inventive work is being seen
somewhere else."

The poet laureate, Andrew Motion, said he had some sympathy but it was
an old argument. "A lot of those barriers have been torn down now, and
bloody well right too.

"The poetry scene has got more tolerant than it used to be and this is
reflected on all sorts of levels," he said.

"I can see the shape of his [Trehy's] argument, but I don't see much
evidence of a closing of ranks. We all have something to learn from one
another, but in the end there is more take-up for one kind of writing
than another."

The Text Festival opens with an exhibition celebrating the life and
work of Bob Cobbing, an internationally recognised British exponent of
concrete, visual and sound poetry, who died in 2002.

...your head would explode….
these are words from…
turntable interrogation techniques
Like your head would explode. …
…like the warm natural lubed silk would keep holdin tight to your prick.
Like the brain she gave was penetratin her belly and comin back up neva
lettin the brief cool air ovatake the motion.
You ovastan the bashment syncopation of sound and visual drug with body
poundin.
To the basement of Pallo’s apt Lil Burg, Gottijinn and Was took this
Lubna E-tard jane. She was bout 16 -- a scanty tight Liberatore dime
inna geisha mask. It was a pretty ceramic one handmade at The
Handmaidens on Johnson st near the square. Crafted and sold by betty
page cloned cyclepathic broads in tight black skirts with glass veils
blow glassed by exjunkies with likkle girls to feed.
…I bet you a dime to 9…
Mightys had hookt up with her at this party at H8’s gates. It was daps
fo shu with the 40ozers laced with GHB and cid. The waddys all took
turns dancin with her -- rubbin up against her vag. Her titties spongin
up gainst their chest. It was like Gotti was gon bust ri alla in H8’s apt..
You ovastan the agoney and all dat
My themes are tactical snapshots
Fuccin an E-Tard jane in the basement, and all dat
H8, Løcel and the older bwoys, like Army and Tek jus watch the shite and
the older plastic face chicas jus huddled up closer to their homebwoys.
H8 was with wifey and turned to fuccin roun with this new laptop he got
off this up sot boogieman at 7:30. His stars were with wifey’s sister
only down the street.
The feminine croons were smoothin the sitiation out and gettin lanas to
rise and glamities trippin.
…or was she…
Was wasn’t the best dancer but he could bounce a pussy into submission.
The Mistahs assault the wetness and she unner her geishe ceremic maka a
muffle mouth moan could be calm or maybe a panic.
…check my tantric circles…
Mightys had gone for a walk to get some air since the party was
clearifyin the desire fixin to begun. The direction was a slow coo glide
into the basement of Pallo’s apt.
When they grind = she whine
the stripping of
exploiting of phobias
these are words from…
turntable interrogation techniques
…and it all feel ras nice thét it only motivate the movement. she move
mo to and fo and born ya.
These are the words
The moves meant. The move meant she move to 68 and Onan lose.
They stript close to naked cept for the jane who was bareass and beggin
for one after another. She was cool cuz she didn’t babble too much and
bust the yänkee’s high.
Gottijinn got to bust a pussy for the fus time in thét basement and so
did...
Jinn, his mom, she a displaced negress who fam come from the original
Africville way back in Hali. She hookt up with a mandime Ojibwai from NW
Onterrable. They had no home to remember and sailors thét past through
were jus ignorant and bad influence on their lil. So Jinn’s papa and mum
found their way here with lil Jinn. BAd idea, yo. Samo deggeh
nagah/gringo shit, crittah.
His papa end up cosht inna car accident runnin and haulin shit forth and
back and back again. His papa was a bleecher fo truht. She neva got ova
it. Ended up too sad to look after Jinn. And the settlass got another
Native lil to fuc with. She got married again but cayn bring the word ri
naw bout the lil bwoy seed of thét Ojibwai mandime.

the stripping of
exploiting of phobias
these are words from…
turntable interrogation techniques
exploiting phobias,
dawgs.
…taking away comfort items
…yänkee/aniki
dojo/mi sensei
…a system of turntable interrogation techniques
that was in part woht was unbassed
and trebling pon sensitivities.
Gimme my try ¡Ya!


Jinn became the abortion thét lived. He spent his years in group homes
gettin fuct and fuct ova. Kids playedout OZ like rape games thét they
got taught by the candy on the television and confirmed by the adults
who were meant to protect them. Gotti turned 18 and got his fus welly
cheque and set up in an apt along the Block btwn Empress and Queen st.
He lost thét one to bein too lonely and lettin the Hillside hooligan
kids take a break from Crip hoppin on beemers to come ova and party and
thieve til the warders showed. But he got hookt up again with another
flat but the loneliness was still grippin him. Then come along the Poro.
Lil Burg and Was was the ones who gave him love and less let but
welcomed him to roll with them and their kind.

1 step 2 step
Cry, cry, cry.
¡Ya!
The dub has eyes
¡Ya!
Done cry no mo lil boy blue.
I’m nah ashamed of you.
Done cry no mo.
I pity the foo who step to you.
These fists are strong and Mighty.

Done need
I’ll take care of you.

Jinn, he a waddy; collectin his sanity -- a sooper sane Jinn. beau
...Was.
Was had gotten suckt off before. He blasted his juice in this rukas face
and with spite he did the same to this feggit smackhead when he was 14.
But he was only scared at the time. But he talks like he got the control
of the sitiation. Feel the hate in the humpin and fuccin -- must be more

Jinn he wont in. He done wont to bust watchin. He wont his gobbled.
Fuccin fantastical and tryin not to wake up the sot next door as Roots
Manuva plays ova the sound of the The Thin Man on the Television in
Pallo’s apt on the otherside.
Kid done say much. He jus hope thét his fly stays up and thét maybe one
daye he find all the love thét was missin from thét fus dick thét
penitrated his thoughts with sad/sads and meanness. He got a scar on his
cheek from the time he tried to say no to one loopy burk.

-Get in alla, crittah. It’s swae, mayn, swae, ¡Ya!-

-Can my homebwoy get a ride, yo-
...and she nod and muffle a,
-..yaeh-
Ast Jinn,
-Woht bout Burg-
-Pop a cherry, aniki-
Woht answer Lil Burg.
Lil Burg was the massive product of perfection gone pomo loco. His daddy
was an LA ghetto negrow dude who Cript out of his hood one daye and
caught a Circle Jerks show in the 80’s. He found out bout a group of
Chicanos on a suicidal trip who pounded hardcore into punk and made it
all Westside thang way fore Pac and Biggie -- East, LA, ese. His daddy,
he met a punk chica and split for the Isla in the Norte Oeste. A 40 and
F.T.W. tat later, Lil Burg would appear out from twn his mama’s legz,
not givin fuc and feelin mad daps to kiss or kill.
Lil Burg, he a Dung bruh -- a New Palestinian, yänkee loco . He was set
to learn how to make it big at butchers shops with revolutionaries
teaching him how to do ritual kills. Right now he’s stuck at a subshop
weighting flower and praying for greens…but still he strole easy in
Mount Doug, carry a gun and rock wallabeez all breezy.
Was, he into ridin his bike and dippin and dippin deeper in the
potholes. Adjusting passages in the loss and found manual in back
pocket. Oh, the perfection of terror, naw, he could stunt dun almost as
good as Tre. Was a bad kid. Was a bad kid with a good heart, though.
Repairin a life in error. The manual and No told him so. He was down for
his homebwoys.
...and Jinn was in.
-oooooooooooooooh, fuuuuuuuucc. Oh mayn this is fun-
…or was she….
all feel ras nice thét it only motivate the move woht meant. The moves
meant. The
move meant to. The move meant...   she move.
Jinn, he like to hook up with a lot of the Somali and Ethopes thét moved
on his Block and even from E-Town. They come to live here, now cuz their
Africville got peacekeepin troopers runnin the Block ova their in the
old country. So dey holdin a mass invation in this country hopin to
hookup with Afro-Am revolutionary hustlas. But they no get better, yush.
They get Cananegkahz and bosie slaves forestead.

Says both Was and Burg,
-You enjoy naw, Jinn, nuh-
-You kno, now….-
Says Jinn,
-G’¡Ya!, fuccin swae...-
Ast Lil Burg,
-Ayo, ma, our homey ayite, gree, ma-
The jane she jus breath deeper and hummed like it was ‘more’.
Thét jane she keep holdin tight to him. With her glamity she
…please....
Jinn
Cry cry …she moved she sighed

neva get this swae. She neva get this nice/nice with any ol dawg.
…and trebling pon sensitivities…

Like the brain she gave she let penetrate her belly. She let it begun

He further states "(A)ctivists are now cruising Downtown Eastside

something "claiming it contains legal advice."

How are people today "reading" in digital, networked environments?  For
example, what is the relation between reading and browsing, or searching?
Or between reading and multimedia?  Can innovations in technologies or
interfaces increase the productivity, variety, and pleasure of these new
kinds of reading?  How can the historical diversity of human reading
practices help us gauge the robustness of the new digital practices; and,
inversely, how can contemporary practices provide new ways to understand the
technical, social, and cultural dimensions of historical reading?  The
Transliteracies 2005 conference (Conversation Roundtables on Online Reading)
assembles theorists and practitioners from the humanities, arts, social
sciences, computer science, and industry to talk about the fate of reading
in the new media age.

Three keynote presentations to mark out the diversity of disciplines and
approaches needed to address the problem of online reading (keynoters: Anne
Balsamo, Walter Bender, Adrian Johns). Three moderated, plenary conversation
roundtables (1. Reading, Past and Present 2. Reading and Media 3. Reading as
a Social Practice).  A presentation session on "The Art of Online Reading."

The conference launches the Transliteracies research project, which brings
together humanities, social-science, and computer-science researchers to
collaborate on technology development related to the future of textual
experience.  To register for the conference (free), comment on the seed
questions for the roundtables, or learn more about the Transliteracies
project, see http://transliteracies.english.ucsb.edu.

We have less than 72 hours to stop the radical Republicans from seizing
absolute control to stack the courts =AD including the Supreme Court. We've
launched an emergency petition we'll be delivering to congress every three
hours until the final vote. Our allies will read your comments on the Senat=
e
floor, and every senator will know the American people are standing ready t=
o
hold them accountable. Please sign today:

Dear MoveOn member,

This is it =8B they've pulled the trigger.

On Tuesday May 24th, the Senate will vote on a motion to end debate on
judicial nominations, and when that motion fails Senator Bill Frist will
launch the "nuclear option" =8B an unprecedented parliamentary maneuver to
break the rules of the Senate and seize absolute control over lifetime
appointments to the highest courts in the land. The vote is going to be
incredibly close, and there are as many as 6 votes still up in the air =8B
more than enough to win.  We must act now.

We've launched an emergency petition and, starting Monday, we'll deliver
your signatures and comments to the Senate floor every three hours until th=
e
vote is complete. As the debate rages on, Senators fighting to preserve our
independent courts will read your statements from the floor of congress. An=
d
every senator, every 3 hours, will receive thousands of pages from their
constituents demanding that they stand up and do the right thing.

We have less than 72 hours to win this vote and save our courts. Please sig=
n
today.=20

If you care about the minimum wage =8B and you don't want judges ruling it
unconstitutional =8B now's the time to act.

If you care about environmental laws =8B and you don't want judges striking
them down =8B now's the time to act.

If you care about your right to privacy =8B and you don't want the government
telling your family how to live, worship, or even how to die =8B now's the
time to act.=20

As the fight escalates in Congress, thousands of MoveOn members will gather
outside of Senate offices and courthouses in every state in the country,
staging round the clock "Citizens' Filibusters to Stop the Right Wing Power
Grab." We'll also deliver your comments to all the gatherings in your state=
,
so your words will combine with thousands of others to show the public, the
media, and our representatives in Washington that we will not give up the
fight for our democracy.

It's a rare moment when a vote of such importance is actually too close to
call with only hours left and a real chance to win  - please sign the
petition and add your voice right now:

Here's a brief summary of what's at stake.

Bill Frist, George Bush and the far wing of the Republican party are
desperate to seize absolute control over all three branches of our
government. For 200 years, the rules of the Senate have blocked one party
from taking complete control, because the minority has always had the right
to filibuster =8B to extend debate and delay a vote =8B when their basic rights
were in danger. For centuries this has kept the courts fair by ensuring tha=
t
judges receive at least some support from both sides of the aisle before
they are confirmed for life.

Now Senator Frist wants to break the rules of the Senate and eliminate the
filibuster, ending the requirement for broad support and handing absolute
control over the courts to one party for the first time in our nation's
history. To begin, he'll force a handful of extremists onto the powerful
U.S. Courts of Appeals. But the real targets are the up to four nominations
to the Supreme Court likely to come up during Bush's second term =8B enough
seats to permanently shift the majority and strike down decades of progress
on labor rights, environmental protection, privacy rights, and civil rights=
.

When Frist first announced his plan, it seemed like it was only a matter of
time. After all, the Republicans have 55 votes in the Senate, and Frist onl=
y
needs 50. But today, with 72 hours left, the vote is still too close to
call. Thanks to the amazing work of MoveOn members, our partner groups, the
Democratic leadership, and basic common sense three Republicans have
publicly denounced Frist's plan =8B Sens. John McCain (AZ), Olympia Snowe
(ME), and Lincoln Chafee (RO). We need just three more to win and as many a=
s
six are still on the fence, including Sens. Arlen Specter (PA), Chuck Hagel
(NE), John Warner (VA), and Susan Collins (ME).

We have one last chance to raise our voice, to help our allies stand strong
and convince reasonable Republicans to step back from the brink. The courts
we have for decades =8B and the rights they protect or the rights they strike

   Le Rosier Cafe at P.S. 1 -- 22-25 Jackson Ave at the intersection of =
46th Ave in Long Island City,

   A reading from Picasso: The Burial of the Count of Orgaz & Other =
Poems

   Free and open to the public.=20

   This event will be broadcast live on WPS1.

   The reading celebrates the publication of The Burial of the Count of =
Orgaz & Other Poems (Exact Change, 2004), the most substantial =
translation into English to date of Picasso's poetry.=20

   For a period of 25 years, beginning in 1935, Picasso engaged in a =
form of radical experimental writing that is now coming to be recognized =
as a major literary breakthrough--not only a    reflection of his own =
time but a beacon for the present. In his characteristic and prolific =
way, he was, as Michel Leiris described him, "an insatiable player with =
words... [who, like] James Joyce ... in his Finnegans Wake,... displayed =
an equal=20
capacity to promote language as a real thing (one might say) ...and to =
use it with as much dazzling liberty."  Seen in this light, the poems =
invite new and surprising readings of Picasso's =20
visual work.

    Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris, coeditors and principal =
translators of The Burial of the Count of Orgaz, will be joined in this =
reading by a number of the volume's guest translators: Carlos Blackburn =
(reading for Paul Blackburn), Ricardo Nirenberg, Diane Rothenberg, Jason =
Weiss, and Mark Weiss.=20

Subject:      Upgraded ELO Website

The Electronic Literature Organization is pleased to announce that their
substantially upgraded website is now in place at
<http://www.eliterature.org>.

To help explain what "electronic literature" is and why we find it so
powerful and compelling, the ELO's new site includes a showcase which
features exemplary works, new and old. The five most recent showcased
items are visible at the top of the main page, and everything featured to
date is also accessible. An RSS feed of the showcase is available so that
readers can automatically keep bookmarks to the current entry or syndicate
the showcase on their own sites.

News items from July 2000 to the present, along with other pages on the
site, are now easily searchable, and recent news is also available by RSS.
The news can also be accessed by category and by date. We hope these and
other features of the site will make it easier for us to provide
announcements and news that interests readers and authors.

The ELO is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established in 1999 to
promote and facilitate the writing, publishing, and reading of electronic
literature. Since its formation, the Electronic Literature Organization
has worked to assist writers and publishers in bringing their literary
works to a wider, global readership and to provide them with the
infrastructure necessary to reach one another.

BELLADONNA*

with

Martine Bellen

&

Karen Weiser

Thursday, May 26, 7PM
Zinc Bar (90 West Houston @ LaGuardia Place)
A $7-10 donation is suggested.

Martine Bellen is the author of five collections of poetry including The
Vulnerability of Order (Copper Canyon Press); Tales of Murasaki and Other
Poems (Sun & Moon Press) which won the National Poetry Series Award; and
Places People Dare Not Enter (Potes & Poets Press). A bilingual collection
of poetry, Musée Magie, was published in 2003 in Germany by Waldgut Verlag
(translator, Hans Jürgen Balmes). She has also written the libretto for
Ovidiana, an opera based on Ovid’s Metamorphoses (composer, Matthew
Greenbaum) that has been performed in New York City and Philadelphia.
Bellen has also been a recipient of the New York Foundation for the Arts,
the Fund for Poetry, and the American Academy of Poets Award. She is a
contributing editor and on the board of directors of Web del Sol
(webdelsol.com). Ms. Bellen has taught at many colleges and universities
including Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts, New York University,
Rutgers University, and Hofstra University.

Karen Weiser lives in New York City where she is studying for her doctorate
in English. Her chapbooks include Placefullness (Ugly Duckling Presse,2004)
and Eight Positive Trees (Pressed Wafer, 2002).  She has recently had poems
in 6X6, Lungfull! Magazine, and Cypress Magazine, and online at
mipoesias.com, canwehaveourballback.com and pompompress.com.

Belladonna* is a feminist/innovative reading and publication series that
promotes the work of women writers who are adventurous, experimental,
politically involved, multi-form, multicultural, multi-gendered,
unpredictable, dangerous with language (to the death machinery). In its five
year history, Belladonna* has featured such writers as Leslie Scalapino,
Alice Notley, Erica Hunt, Fanny Howe, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Cecilia Vicuña,
Lisa Jarnot, Camille Roy, Nicole Brossard, Abigail Child, Norma Cole, Lynne
Tillman, Gail Scott and Carla Harryman among many other experimental and
hybrid women writers. Beyond being a platform for women writers, the

thanks gary---
very cool---also appreciate the commentary
     and actually glad your "ron silliman" software wasn't working

minimalize the poetry events,

The Portal demo Looks, great & smart, Gary.
I suspect the unspoken issue here is "bias."
If SPD is at the low end of the food chain. I suspect it is because it takes
on everyone purely on the basis of categorical content (poetry, fiction).
Beyond that it has no other editorial or commercial objective - other than
to make the material accessible to the trade, libraries and institutions.
 Consortium - which wants to make money - requires a press with financial
incentives large enough to promote and sell their books to pay the cost
catalogs, ads, sales folks, etc. Whether they are good at it, the experience
undoubtedly varies from publisher to publisher.

To cut to the short, and just thinking off the top:
1. The Portal does not seem to operate on a commercial incentive - tho poets
and presses may profit from exposure and sale.
2. One of its attractions is that it serves 'cross media' - blogs, ebooks,
reviews, etc.
3. However - if the Portal is not going to just into the same SPD inventory
glut - it seems important to frame the Portal within some viable editorial
frame.(Good luck!) So that people have some idea of what they are entering.
(Maybe the way Seque projects reflect Language Poetry).

To electrify and maintain interest, a Portal has to figure out its 'buzz'
factor. The authors you name in the demo indicate your interest - and I
would go with that (I like 'em). Otherwise, with a totally open door, the
site may quickly fall into "barnacle time", "digital limbo", etc.

Chris Murray and Ron Silliman and Jim Berhle among others are great at
constantly sewing blog electricity. I think a Portal has to manage that as
well. & when it dies, let it die.

Again, thinking out loud!

Thanks, Stephen, you bring up some good points.

As I'm imagining this thing--which is not to say that I'm necessarily going
to do it--but as I'm thinking about it, there would be some overlap and
dialog with SPD, but that this site might largely cater to presses not taken
by SPD, of which there are many.

SPD does indeed have a bottom line, and it's financial. They can't, and
don't, take everything. Chapbooks are very difficult to get distributed by
them at this point, for instance. Because of their annual fee (which I
believe is $125 at this point), it doesn't make sense for a publisher who
has only done one or two titles and who isn't going to do at least one or
two perfect bound books a year--well, it's just not worth the money to get
distributed by them. I used to be distributed with them, but I literally
can't afford to anymore. I don't mind making no money. But as it is now, I
owe them at least a couple hundred dollars, perhaps a bit more. A number of
publishers are in my situation. So, obviously, we all are looking forward to
some kind of alternative.

Also, there's no way of knowing what SPD's backlist is. They don't seem to
do an annual catalog with all their titles anymore, and their website has no
browse function. The online model I proposed attempts to address this, by
cataloging everything and having browse by author, title, press, and
category functions, as well as the standard "search." People would be
encouraged to review books by people whose books are available at the
portal. That sounds nepotistic, I suppose, but my favorite review journal,
The Comics Journal, which is published by Fantagraphics, frequently runs
reviews of Fantagraphics books. There are occasional complaints about that,
but no one takes them seriously. Fantagraphics books get panned sometimes in
TCJ.

The issue of bias is an interesting one, and should be given plenty of
thought before embarking on such a project. What to include and what not to
include. It has to be hammered out. Like I said, I'm not necessarily going
to do this project myself, although I'm vaguely considering it. I know a
couple of others who are also considering it. At some point, someone will
actually do it, so I put up that model so anyone could take from it whatever
looked viable.

You're right: as I'm imagining it, anyway, it's not a commercial venture.
There would be no employees, no warehouse. It would operate like
http://www.abebooks.com, in terms of how things got sold. But, this would be
a way for people to be part of a larger online community / resource center /
store, and would only cost publishers the amount that would be taken out per
sale--whatever that might be (5%-10%, I would imagine).

I definitely hear your comment about the portal needing to constantly
generate interest and dialog, and that would and should be considered as the
various "content" stuff gets hammered out (e.g., associated blogs,
reviewers, essayists, and so on). If people don't have a reason not to go
revisit, they won't.

Thanks, Stephen, for your very thoughtful response. I welcome more!

Gary

Dear sidereality fans & readers:

I hope that everyone is having a great spring, and that all of you are
doing well.

Recently, I've come to the realization that my heart's just simply not
where it needs to be in order to continue editing and producing
sidereality. So, unless someone new wants to step into the position of
Managing Editor between now and the end of June, the second 2004 issue
will be the final issue of sidereality. It saddens me to end my stint
as the creator of this oftentimes wonderful zine, but I think it's
something that, unfortunately, needs to happen. We've had, I think, a
very good run, and I certainly don't want to continue into a
second-rate future.

I expect to keep all of sidereality's back issues online, and I may
indeed come up with a "Best Of" print collection in the near future.

Please note that I'm not stepping away from the editing world forever
(I do have some ideas for a different type of poetry publication), but
it will be a few months before things coalesce into something
definite.

EDITORS: I've enjoyed collaborating with all of you, and I hope to
work with many of you again in the future.

READERS: Put simply, you made sidereality one of the best poetry
venues on the internet for the past three years.

CONTRIBUTORS & FUTURE CONTRIBUTORS: You're all quite wonderful
writers, and I wish much success, poetic and otherwise, to each of
you. If you were scheduled to have your work published by sidereality
in 2005, please consider it released at this time.

Thanks again, my friends. Please do feel free to pass this message
along to other interested parties.

Best wishes,
Clay

I have composed a letter to my friends.
You are my friends.

Be well in poetry, among other things I cannot speak of.

Goodbye, poetry, take care of my friends.

First International City of Vinaròs Award for Digital Literature

Vinaròs city council and the Open University of Catalonia, through its
Hermeneia research group, have created the “International City of Vinaròs
Award for Digital Literature”. This award looks to catalyse the creation of
digital literature, its recognition and broadcast. It is open to writers
working in Catalan, Spanish, English, French, Portuguese or Italian. Work
can be submitted from the first week of May until September 8.

The International City of Vinaròs Award for Digital Literature, one of the
first of its kind on a European scale, is designed to reward authors for
works that involve digital technology in their production. The award is
split into two categories: digital narrative (which includes hypertext
narrative, interactive stories and any literary works that use the computer
as a means for narration) and poetry (with pieces of dynamic poetry,
computer-generated poetry, etc.). The winner from each of these categories
will receive 2,500 euros. Likewise, the jury is to award the Vicent Ferrer
Romero special mention to the best work submitted in Catalan, the winner of
which will receive 1,500 euros. Writers can present unpublished work on any
subject. In the case of the poetry category, they can send a single poem or
a collection.

The jury for this award, formed annually, is made up of experts in digital
literature. The criteria that they take into account when assessing the
works are literary quality, quality and accessibility of the interface
design, experimentation with the web as a means for literary creation, and
exploration and exploitation of the computer as a means for creation.

The works should be sent to Hermeneia (Humanities and Philology Studies, Av.
Tibidabo, 39, 08035, Barcelona, Spain) in a sealed envelope, clearly stating
1st CITY OF VINARÒS AWARD FOR DIGITAL LITERATURE and whether the entry is
for the digital narrative or poetry category on the outside. The envelopes
have to contain three copies of the work on CD and another sealed envelope,
with the title of the work on the outside, a pseudonym or headword, where
necessary, and any technical information needed to access the work;
information on the writer(s) (name, address, telephone number, email,
country of origin and a photocopy of their ID or passport) should be
enclosed inside this envelope to ensure anonymity. There should also be a
short summary of their literary works to date.
Hermeneia

Hermeneia is a research group investigating literary studies and digital
technologies and made up of experts from Brown University (USA), Bari
University (Italy), the University of Turku (Finland), Ramon Llull
University (Spain), Pompeu Fabra University (Spain), the University of
Barcelona (Spain), the University of Essex (UK), the Autonomous University
of Barcelona (Spain), Artois University (France), Rovira i Virgili
University (Spain) and the UOC.
Its aim is to carry out research into the emergence of technology in terms
of literary studies and literature itself, analysing the repercussions and
producing a map of literary studies on the web, available to the whole of
the European university community on the website. There are four basic lines
of research: hypertext and literary studies, literary theory and comparative
literature on the internet, the Lletra project and electronic literature.

If poetry is eating, why does it never fill its stomach or ours, the poets?  If its eating itself to death, why is there so much poetry?  If it's eating itself to life, when will it make the transformation into life, over & out /in?

Dear all --

Rhubarb is susan updates this week with two reviews from John Tranter's
Jacket Magazine, straight outta Oz. I take a look at Lisa Robertson's long
form poem Wooden Houses, which is absolutely terrific, and then as a
warm-down the brief and fun lyric Miltonic by Kate Lilley.

http://rhubarbissusan.blogspot.com/2005/05/kate-lilley-miltonic.html

Hardcore rhubarb fans may also want to take a look at this review:

http://www.fifthstreetreview.com/lit_files/swanlovestory.htm

of my 30 page prose-poem SWAN, which appears in the Fifth Street Review.
Hardcopies of SWAN are still available, please drop me a line if you're
interested in getting one of your own.

Thanks for tuning in!

Comments: cc: laurelreiner@aol.com

On NPR's Morning Edition, Nina Tottenberg announced that if the
Supreme Court supports Congress, it will, in effect, be the end of
the National Public Radio (NPR), National Endowment for the Arts
(NEA), and the Public Broadcasting System (PBS). PBS, NPR and the
arts are facing major cutbacks in funding. In spite of the efforts of
each station to reduce spending costs and streamline their services,
some government officials believe that the funding currently going to
these programs is too large a portion of funding for something which
is seen as not worthwhile. This is for anyone who thinks NPR/PBS is a
worthwhile expenditure of $1.12/year of their taxes. The only way
that our representatives can be aware of the base of support for PBS
and funding for these types of programs is by making our voices
heard. Please add your name to this list and forward it to friends
who believe in what this stands for. This list will be forwarded to
the President and the Vice President of the United States. This
petition is being passed around the Internet. Please add your name to
it so that funding can be maintained for NPR, PBS, and the NEA. HOW
TO SIGN: IT'S EASY: First SELECT all of the text in this message,
then COPY and PASTE it into a new email (DO NOT FORWARD). ADD your
name to the bottom of the list and SEND it to everyone in your list.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT DUPLICATES. This is being sent to several people at
once to add their names to the petition. It won't matter if many
people receive the same list as THE NAMES ARE BEING MANAGED. If you
decide not to sign, please don't kill it. Send it to the email
address listed here:
<http://by103fd.bay103.hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/HoTMaiL?curmbox=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&a=f5b081a679c7618cf9220035d944acbf>wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu

If you happen to be the 150th, 200th, 250th, etc., signer of this
petition, please forward a copy to the above address. This way we can
keep track of the lists and organize them. Send this to everyone you
know, and help us to keep these programs alive. Thank you!

Hello,

Legitimate press releases almost always carry a date, and often specifics.

Legitimate e-mail addresses very rarely look anything remotely like
<http://by103fd.bay103.hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/HoTMaiL?curmbox=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001&a=f5b081a679c7618cf9220035d944acbf>wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu

This "petition" has been circulating for years. If you'd like to help
the NEA (which sends almost no money to NPR or PBS), check out

Yours,

It is 4:45 in Washington. He Senate is apparently going to vote on the
Bolton nomination at 6 o'clock.
California Senator Feinstein has not committed her vote yet. (I wonder what
Karl Rove has promised her?)
If concerned,  as many of us are, Email her office pronto (the phone lines
are impossible to get through)
http://feinstein.senate.gov/email.html
This will give you the form at her website that will direct the email within
her office.

Thanks,

Readers of this listserv will be pleased to learn that the May 25th dedicat=
ion ceremony for the Ronald Johnson memorial plaque in Warde-Meade Park in =
Topeka was a great success.  The ceremony included brief addresses by Peter=
 O=92Leary, Devin Johnston, Norman Finkelstein, Jodi Panula (Ron=92s sister=
), Susan Marchant (Topeka Public Library) and Bill Riphahn (Topeka Parks De=
pt.).  The unveiling of the plaque, which contains the text of the poem =93=
Two Seasons=94 from The Shrubberies, was followed by a recital of American =
songs by Ann Marie Snook, and a reception including recipes from Ron=92s Am=
erican Table.  Ron composed most of The Shrubberies, his last book, while w=
orking as a gardener, handyman and baker at Ward-Meade.  The plaque is loca=
ted near a bench and trellis where Ron often sat and wrote.

In the evening, a symposium was held at the Topkeka Publica Library, which =
includeded an overview of Ron=92s work by Peter O=92Leary, a discussion of =
The Shrubberies by Devin Johnston, and of Radi Os and The Shrubberies by No=
rman Finkelstein.  Kansas author Tom Averill moderated both events.  The da=
y was organized by Robert Webb, who has started a group called Friends & Re=
aders of Ronald Johnson.  And indeed, all friend of Ron and readers of his =
poetry owe Bob a great debt of thanks.

With a little luck, photos from the ceremony will be up on the web soon.  S=
tay tuned for further details.

Thanks, Charles.  I would add:

Queen Cocaine, by Nuria Amat, City Lights Books, trans. by Peter Bush
    (Amat is a Barcelonan, a poet's fictionist of the highest order, using
language switchbacks, tribal belief and European disbelief, and the cocaine
wars of Colombia, which create a frightening, profound triangulated prose.
Also for those who read Spanish, her Amor Infiel, responses to Dickinson's
poems and letters.  Not yet translated  into English but available.)

For Love (poems 1950-1960), Robert Creeley's first , Scribner's,
available in other collections. A primer. All else follows from these.

And not recent but always new, D. Allen's edition of The Poems of Frank
O'Hara, UC Press.  An accident on a mind-beach gave me a morning with these
miraculous, shimmering poems that no one else on earth could have written
with O'Hara's particular halo.  How much he did in so few years and with
such humility and originality returns over and over.

With deep homage, also recommend any and all books by the late Lucia Berlin.
There was no poetry this fiction writer didn't love and use.

And for new flowers:  be on the lookout for work by Kate Colby, whose first
book, Fruitlands, will be published by Ugly Duckling Press soon.  Much to
learn from this young, former student of mine, who may well move in Susan
Howe's path of history made poetry.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hello all,
For a number of reasons, the Vision Festival has been forced to change
its venue for this year -

We will  return to our former historic home at the Orensanz Art Center.
Many of you know the Orensanz and know that it is a beautiful place to
hear music. Though the late change is unfortunate, the Orensanz is a very
favorable solution that will make for a wonderful festival. More info is
available below.


PLEASE forward this to as many people as possible to get the word out
about the change.

Thank you,
Patricia


VISION FESTIVAL VENUE CHANGE
FESTIVAL TO RETURN TO ORENSANZ ART CENTER FOR OUR TENTH YEAR



New Location: Orensanz Art Center: 172 Norfolk St. (just south of
Houston)
June 14 to June 19, 2005
Tickets: $25 per night or $125 for 6 day pass
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
---




The 2005 VISION FESTIVAL will be returning to its historic home at the
ORENSANZ ART CENTER for our festival from June 14 to 19th. Due to
unforeseen difficulties regarding fire regulations at the Clemente Soto
Velez Cultural Center, the 2005 Vision Festival has been forced into this
late change. The NEW LOCATION for the 2005 festival will be at the
Orensanz Art Center, located at 172 Norfolk Street just south of Houston.
All musicians and programming will remain unchanged, with minor
alterations in set times. For more info, please see our website at
www.visionfestival.org.

Although this last minute venue change is an unfortunate circumstance,
the Orensanz is an ideal location for the festival, housing early Vision
Festivals in 1997, 1998 and 2001. It is the most beautiful setting for
the festival, architecturally embodying the sense of community that is
such an important part of our presentations.  It is an ideal both
visually and acoustically.  The venue's proximity to the Clemente Soto
Velez Cultural Center (two blocks away) should minimize confusion due to
the change of location.

Please update all listings and announcements to reflect this change.

I am looking for books/papers that delve into the philosophical issues
raised by such people as Cantor, Gödel, Turing, Chomsky's early work etc in
relation to language and the language arts. In other words, I'm looking for
books/papers that explore the impact of this work on our understanding of
language and epistemology. And ourselves and who we are. If you know any,
I'd appreciate hearing about them.

I ordered some books the other day that will keep me busy for a while, but
these are not so much oriented to exploration of the consequences concerning
language, art, and communications. Though they may approach the
philosophical/epistemological and definitely the historical and
mathematical.

Those books, if you like, are

1. The Universal Computer: The Road from Leibniz to Turing by Martin Davis
2. Computability and Unsolvability by Martin Davis
3. The Undecidable by Martin Davis
4. Gödel's Proof by Ernest Nagel

Of course there's Hofstadter's work, of which I'm aware. And Penrose's
misinformations. Kate Hayles's book 'How We Became Posthuman' is also kind
of interesting as a history of ideas concerning the rise of cybernetics and
changes in the image of what we are. But, again, these don't really explore
the subject from a perspective particularly attuned to the concern of poets
with language.

New from Cuneiform Press:

I've been away from my desk in Buffalo for some time, but busy in the =
Druckwerkstatt at Berlin's Kunstlerhaus Bethanian. Now back in town, =
Cuneiform's homepage has just been updated with some exciting new books, =
broadsides and other oddities including:

Robert Creeley's "Oh, do you remember . . ." a signed, illustrated, =
limited-edition broadside printed letterpress on white, yellow, or brown =
paper from the Fabriano Mills of Italy.

Kyle Schlesinger's Moonlighting moonlights as an artists' book and prose =
poem. In each folio, text blocks rest against a neo-fauvist pallet of =
pixilated puns.

Kyle Schlesinger's A Book of Closings is an unbound arrangement of =
"closings" extracted from the correspondence of Irving Layton & Robert =
Creeley. Handset in Lux and Schmalhalbfette on 100% rag off-white =
coverstock housed in a blue portfolio.=20

Also, another smashing issue of Kiosk will be available in a few short =
weeks! Secure a copy today for the lower than low price of $5 for this =
perfect-bound, 250 page journal. That's 2 cents a page folks! =
Contributors include: Bruce Andrews & Jessica Grim, Michael Davidson, =
Rae Armantrout, Cole Swensen, Ken Edwards, Eliza Newman-Saul, Ben =
Lerner, Tom Thompson, Jon Thompson, Alphonso Lingis, Robyn Schiff, =
Richard Deming, Brendan Lorber, Nick Twemlow and Craig Watson. But wait, =
there's more! The 2005 issue includes a special 60 + min. audio =
accompaniment featuring Robert Creeley reading in Vermont, Michael =
Basinski and Sarah Campbell.

Looking back, there are still a few copies of the following titles from =
2004:

Ron Silliman's Woundwood

Craig Dworkin's Dure

Andrew Levy's Scratch Space

Alan Loney's Meditatio : the printer printed : manifesto

Robert Creeley's "Place to Be"

And here's a sneak preview of what's coming down the pipe in 2005:

Johanna Drucker's FROM NOW is a captivating chapbook designed by the =
author, handsewn with covers printed by hand at the Cuneiform Press.

Gil Ott's The Amputated Toe is the long-awaited short story from one of =
Philly's most cherished poets and publishers.

Kyle Schlesinger and Caroline Koebel's Schablone Berlin is an artists' =
book that examines the semiotic and performative aspects of stencil art =
on the streets of Germany's most invigorating metropolis.

To order any of these titles, please visit: www.cuneiformpress.com

As always, my thanks for supporting Cuneiform Press and its authors!

Cheers,

I don't know the specific names, but you should find some good ones on Yonge
Street (between the Eaton Center and Bloor Street) and Queen Street (East or
West I can't remember). Pages on Queen Street is a very good independent
store, but I think it sells new books, not used. Still, its poetry section
is worth looking at. I hope someone with a better knowledge of Toronto will
fill you in. I'd like to know a few more, myself, for my next visit. I hope
this helps a little.

Julia Randall, 81, poet who focused on loss of countryside

Julia Randall, a poet, teacher and environmental activist whose taut
verse mourned the loss of Baltimore's countryside, died of heart
disease Sunday at her home in North Bennington, Vt. She was 81 and
had formerly resided in Glen Arm.

She wrote seven volumes of poetry, and was described this week by
former Sun arts writer John Dorsey as "one of the most intellectual
poets of the 20th century" and "one of the two best-known poets in
Baltimore of the 20th century, with Josephine Jacobsen."

Born in Baltimore and raised on Pot Spring Road, she attended Calvert
School and was a 1941 graduate of Bryn Mawr School. She earned a
bachelor's degree in English at Bennington College and studied at the
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, but left -- recalling in a 1972
letter to a writing society that "medicine would not allow me enough
time to muse."

"So I went to Harvard in English and hated it," she continued in the
letter, adding that she received her master's degree in 1950 in the
Hopkins writing seminar and went into teaching at the college level
-- except for the summer months, when she devoted herself to writing.

"I can't possibly write while I'm teaching," she said in her letter.
"Teaching is a 24-hour job."

Miss Randall taught 19th-century British poetry and general courses
which she described as ranging from Homer and Chaucer to contemporary
fiction, holding teaching positions over the years at the Hopkins
evening school, then known as McCoy College; a University of Maryland
branch in Paris; Goucher College; and the Peabody Conservatory.

From 1958 to 1962 she was an assistant professor at what is now
Towson University, and for a decade until retiring in 1973 was
assistant professor of English at what is now Hollins University in
Roanoke, Va. -- living, as she described it, "in a cabin on the back
of the Hollins campus, in front of the horse barn, surrounded by
pastures and mountains."

After leaving Virginia, Miss Randall lived in an old house on Harley
Mill Road in Glen Arm during the 1970s and 1980s, where she observed
change and feared the impact developers and industry might have on
the surrounding Long Green Valley.

She channeled much of her environmental emotion into her poems,
prompting Stephen Margulies to write in a 1987 Sun review of one of
her books, "Maryland is her Eden."

"You drive out here, you drive out through Towson, all around the
Beltway, south in Anne Arundel County, too, and it's just
heartbreaking," she told a Sun reporter in 1980. "I mean, you can't
go home again because it's just not there. The streams are polluted,
the lip service to preservation of agricultural lands and watersheds
is exactly that, the planning board has no power, nobody has any
thought for the future."

Miss Randall left Maryland in 1987 for a home in Vermont. Much of the
land she had sought to protect here was later placed under
preservation ordinances.

"She worked hard to save the Long Green Valley," said her
sister-in-law, Lilian M.C. Randall, a former Walters Art Museum
manuscripts curator. "She fought like a demon. Whatever she did, she
did it well and intently."

Her volumes of poetry are: The Solstice Tree (1952), Mimic August
(1960), The Puritan Carpenter (1965), Adam's Dream (1969), The
Farewells (1981), Moving in Memory (1987), and The Path to Fairview
(1992).

In 1980, she received the American Poetry Society's Percy Bysshe
Shelley Award in recognition of her body of work.

"Her poetry is lean and spare," said Moira Egan, a poet who heads the
Catonsville High School creative writing program. "She used a quiet
care to describe the landscape of Maryland and the interior landscape
of her own memory, her sense of loss and her own mortality."

"Her wit and passion, the verbal beauty and formal balance of each
poem combined to make a distinctive voice which asked the reader to
enjoy her singing and at the same time to think," Stephen Sandy, a
poet and retired Bennington College literature professor, said
yesterday.

"In later years she turned her own blend of allusion and observation
to stark present-day realities when, with abiding anguish, she wrote
of the fate of the natural world in our greedy hands," Mr. Sandy
said. "To the last, she sang in her plain, intelligent, distinctive
voice of complex matters."

Plans for a memorial service are incomplete.

Survivors include a nephew and two nieces. Her marriage to former Sun
art critic Kenneth Sawyer ended in divorce. Her brother, Richard H.
Randall, director of the Walters Art Museum, died in 1997.

This is the Toronto section of a much larger used bookstore site I
find useful when visiting new cities:

http://www.geocities.com/evelynleeper/na-can-o.htm#toronto

It's a lot of info to digest, but it includes pretty good descriptions
of each bookstore listed -- which might help you prioritize your
stops.

Only two I know of: This Ain't the Rosedale Library on Church, and Open
City on Danforth (although a smallish collection, I recently purchased
10 hard-to-find older collections for only $12, after the "poetry
discount").

I'm sure there are lots more. I'd suggest contacting one of Toronto's
list modifiers for a group called the Lexicon Jury--Angela Rawlings.
She'll know. She's got her fingertips on the pulse. angela@thescream.ca

have fun in TO-it's a great city.

To these I would add, just off the top of my head and away from my desk two other great books the latter of which will definitely be my summer reading:

Cyrano De Bergerac, Edmond Rostand (don't laugh.  It's a great play and in verse.)
Rackstraw Downes (the new, beautiful coffeetable book of Rackstraw's art with essays by Robert Storr, Rackstraw, and others.
There may be more to this list when and if I return to it on Tuesday.

Now that I remember that what you said is that poetry is eating itself alive, could it be because nobody is feeding it?  If it's eating itself alive, it should be growing thinner.  Nevertheless, it expands in number of poems out there rather than contracts.  If this is the opposite of the ultimate diet, should someone publicize it as such: as in how to get fat on no money?  This is not meant as a joke about people with some sort of nonfood problem with being overweight; it's meant to be a comment on poetry and poets only. As I read the poem attached to this title I think: Could insects write poetry would they have a genuinely fresh perspective to offer?  Given the large amount of poetry out there, unless they have a unique written language to contribute, of which we have been unaware til now, this seems unlikely.

Hello all, I'm a lurking grad student from Brown, and if I can humbly suggest another first book to check out (no not mine--yet), I recently read and fell in love with Eric Baus' The To Sound. Forrest Gander chose it for the Verse Prize, and it was published last year. Some amazing field comp work mixed with mostly prose poems, many epistolary (addressed to a "Dearest Sister" and "Dear Birds"). I was pretty excited reading it. http://www.versepress.org/baus.html

Cheers,

Tod


There's the mute probability of a reciprocal lack of understanding.

heres your friend. william moor. dmanit! slept in an inflatable bed that
was
deflated when I woke up. This weekend was insane fighting at 2 am and
etc
etc etc then I get back tonite and neighbors are asking me all these
crazy
questions. im like, "sorry, I was in Sacramento for the weeken" all I
know
is I have a pic of dude seventies afro next to my computer. If you have
not
reD THE BOOK IT WOULD BE DREADFYLLU
NBORING.  I had ice cream last night walked around the lake with emcee.
Anyway-to sleep, hope you feel better, take some vitamins (English
accent)-
and hit that beach up! I wonder if anything comes up
lacan and spinoza he's one of those spinoza and all of them. east
African
countries where they actually do it a middle class precocious child by
an
ardently catholic mother he eventually lost. I am sunbirnt
and sun dried tired-sounds good. Good to hear from you, I want to get a
lacaninan analysis, done, hehehe, just kidding. work was great, made my
first sale, got my own big desk to sit at, got a free bottle of
dope wine---making food right now, sounds like youll be out, but ill
save
some on the off chance that you have a moment, but don't
worry-eventually I
will have to stop talking about this job. Its not a pyramid scheme (damn

fbi)-but we are all professional people so we must unite to destroy the
forces of de-professionalizationism).

Taylor Brady is the author of Yesterday's News (Factory School, 2005)
and
Microclimates (Krupskaya, 2001). A new book, Occupational Treatment, is
forthcoming from Atelos this year. He lives in San Francisco, works in
Oakland, and writes a good deal in the Transbay Tube. Current projects
include a novel about interruption, financialist regimes and the social
providence of paranoia, a series of essays on echoes, and the editorship
of
a hypothetical book series exploring rhythmic architecture and land-use
melodrama. He would prefer not to.

Stan Apps was born in Canada and lives in Los Angeles.  His book, soft
hands, was published by Ugly Duckling Presse.  A few other books are
mewling
plaintively for publication.  Stan likes to play with blogs such as
Totally
Obvious ( http://obviousnews.blogspot.com) and refried ORACLE phone
(http://oracularvaginatakesherplace.blogspot.com).  Lightbulbs actually
appear and shatter over Stan's head whenever he has an idea.

All: this is somewhat interesting--Wordcount is an artistic
visualisation of the popularity of words in the English Language done
in Flash. 'It presents the 86,800 most frequently used English words,
ranked in order of commonness. Each word is scaled to reflect its
frequency relative to the words that precede and follow it, giving a
visual barometer of relevance.'

If I type in 'hell' the next most popular words are 'apparent'
'continuing' 'curriculum'!  ha.

Ha. That would be a toughie. 'I've made a 'career' out of' not writing
books.

Here's a poet named Michael Harold making some sort of approach to this

Thanks, Peter. I am not familiar with Andy Clark's work, actually. Is there
some sort of concentration on language? He's a philosopher. What sort?

ja

only the good die young
the bad are left to grow old and rot
i am rotting

old people should be killed
they're in the way
they're useless

their flesh tastes bad
they're shapeless skin and bones
or layers of ugly fat

their minds are dead
their minds are waiting
for their bodies to catch up

old men are our past
the young are our future
grandmothers = carriers of wisdom

cart them off
cart them all off
they burn fast in the furnaces

the eskimo left them on the ice
the jews buried them alive
the christians yoked them

buddhists trample their necks
confucians spit on their altars
the muslims cut off their heads

believe what you want
someone cut off their heads
someone trampled them

old people have nothing to say
their ideas are like deSotos
that's a car we all used to drive

take their cars and belongings
divide them up take them apart
memories are made for crashing

look at the old man
push him down the hill
he can't think when he's falling

he can't think when he's standing
when he's standing he's falling
he's always falling when he's standing

i wake up and hope you'll kill me
i'm useless and can't think a thought
or this is the thought i think

when i'm permitted to think
when you've maybe read this far

i'll leave this line alone

Jim Andrews:

I would second Peter Cudmore's recommendation to read Andy Clark (I'd
begin with "Being There").  He was at IUB before taking the chair at
Edinburgh, and I sat in on a number of interdisciplinary reading groups
and colloquia with cog sci and biology folks.  He once described his style
as "doing philosophy around the edges" of cognitive science, if that helps
you at all.  Perhaps his earlier work is more concerned with the kind of
mathematics it seems interest you most, but his last three books are in
the vein of Merleau-Ponty, Dennett, Varela, etc.  His work is marked by
the usual cog sci witticisms, but also a kind of enthusiasm for
technological innovation that, it seems to me, ends up trumping any
concern for "consequences."  The science-fiction diary that he
incorporates into "Natural Born Cyborgs" is very revealing in this
respect.

Did you know that Warren McCulloch (one of the co-authors of the famous
Maturana frog's eye essay) wrote poetry?  Terrible stuff.

Used

/Balfour Books/ on College: better for art and photography, also a great
collection of paperback Canadian novels. Occasionally some good poetry.

/Annex Books/ on Bathurst (N. of Bloor): lots of great out of print

I wouldn't say 'language' per se. The first book, Microcognition, deals with
the 'classical', Fodor/Chomsky-oriented approach to artificial intelligence.
Ken, up till the 80s AI was heavily into trying to make a machine capable of
playing Turing's Imitation Game, which meant developing software
implementations of natural language. To that extent he -- and I -- are
interested in language, because there was obviously something seriously
wrong with the classical AI approach (even though the spinoffs have been
hugely beneficial in other respects). We're both -- in our different ways --
interested in how they were so mistaken.

I guess he (Clark) might answer the 'what sort' question with 'my sort', but
there's a broad allegiance to the Santa Fe Perspective, and also to Dennett.
He's officially Professor of Logic & Metaphysics.

I suspect that SPD's charging publishers for storing their inventory will
reduce significantly the number of publishers who can afford to do business
with them. A few years back, Ingram informed me that they were going to
charge for inventory. I think the price came out to at least $800/year
because they specified a minimum number of copies per title. Since they sell
their books at a 55% discount, each sale brought me slightly more than the
cost of printing each copy. By the time I put the book in an envelope and
put a stamp on it, I was losing money. Given my dismal rate of sales, if I
were to pay for maintaining an inventory in their warehouse, I would have
done better giving away each book with a $50 bill as a bookmark. So far,
Baker & Taylor hasn't charged me.



I think an online network, or several coordinated networks accommodating
different reading tastes, might be the best way for noncommercial writers
and publishers to continue to present their work to the public. Each
publisher or poet could receive an order and fill it. Maybe, if the
discounts for books aren't too deep, each press or author could

make a nominal PayPal payment to help maintain the site. You proposed a
similar idea, I believe.



I haven't thought this out very far. Michael Rothenberg and I have engaged
in some preliminary discussions about a related issue, but haven't gotten
far enough to arrive at any conclusions. But your proposal sounds, at this
stage, like an idea that might save a lot of us from having no distribution
whatsoever.



Please keep us informed.

Subject: Re: Notes for an online poetry bookstore



Thanks, Stephen, you bring up some good points.



As I'm imagining this thing--which is not to say that I'm necessarily going

to do it--but as I'm thinking about it, there would be some overlap and

dialog with SPD, but that this site might largely cater to presses not taken

by SPD, of which there are many.



SPD does indeed have a bottom line, and it's financial. They can't, and

don't, take everything. Chapbooks are very difficult to get distributed by

them at this point, for instance. Because of their annual fee (which I

believe is $125 at this point), it doesn't make sense for a publisher who

has only done one or two titles and who isn't going to do at least one or

two perfect bound books a year--well, it's just not worth the money to get

distributed by them. I used to be distributed with them, but I literally

can't afford to anymore. I don't mind making no money. But as it is now, I

owe them at least a couple hundred dollars, perhaps a bit more. A number of

publishers are in my situation. So, obviously, we all are looking forward to

some kind of alternative.



Also, there's no way of knowing what SPD's backlist is. They don't seem to

do an annual catalog with all their titles anymore, and their website has no

browse function. The online model I proposed attempts to address this, by

cataloging everything and having browse by author, title, press, and

category functions, as well as the standard "search." People would be

encouraged to review books by people whose books are available at the

portal. That sounds nepotistic, I suppose, but my favorite review journal,

The Comics Journal, which is published by Fantagraphics, frequently runs

reviews of Fantagraphics books. There are occasional complaints about that,

but no one takes them seriously. Fantagraphics books get panned sometimes in

TCJ.



The issue of bias is an interesting one, and should be given plenty of

thought before embarking on such a project. What to include and what not to

include. It has to be hammered out. Like I said, I'm not necessarily going

to do this project myself, although I'm vaguely considering it. I know a

couple of others who are also considering it. At some point, someone will

actually do it, so I put up that model so anyone could take from it whatever

looked viable.



You're right: as I'm imagining it, anyway, it's not a commercial venture.

There would be no employees, no warehouse. It would operate like

http://www.abebooks.com, in terms of how things got sold. But, this would be

a way for people to be part of a larger online community / resource center /

store, and would only cost publishers the amount that would be taken out per

sale--whatever that might be (5%-10%, I would imagine).



I definitely hear your comment about the portal needing to constantly

generate interest and dialog, and that would and should be considered as the

various "content" stuff gets hammered out (e.g., associated blogs,

reviewers, essayists, and so on). If people don't have a reason not to go

revisit, they won't.



Thanks, Stephen, for your very thoughtful response. I welcome more!

enjoying the discussion that gary has spurred here and others have followed
up on. some of what's been mentioned by him and talked about here has been
discussed at great length since last august when jerrold shiroma began
gathering small press editors (gary and myself among them) to begin talks
about starting a new web-based distributor. jerrold would have the online

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

     What's the use of poetry that pretends post-modernism never happened? Likewise, what's the use of poetry that pretends post-modernism is completely a good thing? I would argue that post-modernism & its' poetry flag-ship (LP) took certain things out of poetry that we may want to consider putting back in again-- emotion, gravitas, Formal Rigor. Not that the best LP stuff isn't rigorous, just that standard Formalism (based in Romantic and/or Modernist tradition) does build a certain amount of durability into any given poem.
    What I want is to take the best bits of LP, then add a dose of non-LP "granola"-- the Romantic/Confessional "I", the acceptance of a bit of sentiment here & there, "normal" perspectives rather than "skewered", etc. So this is a "hybrid poetics". What this hybrid poetics needs to address is our essentially virtual world. The Web-Age has destroyed once and for all any base actuality in our lives, and poems should reflect this without the post-modern habit of detachment, irony, and twisted bile.
    When we re-add gravitas, emotion, and Formal Rigor to the LP mix, what we get is a kind of Mannerism. Exaggeration, hyperbole, and "mess is more" recklessness extend what Mannerists like Parmigianino accomplished post-Renaissance, as well as the "Mannerist sense" that Philly architect Robert Venturi has developed. Venturi says, "Viva Mannerism that richly acknowledges ambiguity and inconsistency in a complex and contradictory time". I feel that this "Viva" should be chanted by poets as well.
    The new Mannerism both acknowledges and encourages the new preponderance of hybrid forms. Not that LP/ post-modernism didn't also do this, but Mannerism, unlike post-modernism, veers towards the direct rather than the oblique. "Mess is more" doesn't just mean more skewering/irony, it means more gravitas, emotion, Formal Rigor as well (though Formal Rigor is admittedly a hazy subjectivist concept, please humor me). Mannerism both is multi-media and justifies multi-media....more feelings! The return of the battered, bruised, but exultant "I"! Let's put it this way...post-modernism (& to some extent its' off-shoots, like LP) is a Campbell's Soup can....Mannerism is a Campbell's Soup can held by Michelangelo's David. Mannerism wants, demands everything. Mannerism not only wants to swallow post-modernism, it wants to swallow the 2000 years of art that came before it...Classics! Romantics! Metaphysics!
    A key concept for Mannerist poetics is rhetopoeia. Pound posited logopoeia (poem content, more or less), phanopoeia (imagery), and melopoeia ("music"/poetic language). Rhetopoeia is the rhetorical gist of the poem, its' way of telling us "I am necessary to you because...I am an important poem because.." To paraphrase Roland Barthes, "The poem you write must prove to me that it desires me". Mannerism is seductive, post-post-modern, traditional & revolutionary. It wants to reach out across boundary-lines, and dares to believe that poetry might have a wide audience again. Take LP, Robert Lowell, Charles Bukowski, Keats, Mallarme, everyone, put 'em in a blender, that's Mannerism. Beautiful Form, post-modern awareness of plasticity/virtuality. That's the thing in a nut-shell. I'm looking for poets to help me develop these ideas.

A sleepy Sunday update to keep you amused through Memorial day as you
guide your SUV over the L.I.E. and up the driveway to your Hamptons Summer
rental. Two reviews are up, one of Regnald Shepherd (in Ploughshares), and
one of Landis Everson (in Washington Square.)

 Click here: The Assassinated Press

Amnesty takes aim at Gitmo---Metaphorically:
Rumsfeld Mocks Unarmed Group---"What do I give a shit about a bunch of
unarmed human rights sissies?"
Group Don't Pack Their Bark With Any Bite So Thugs Act With Greater And
Greater License And Things Get Worse For Their Meddling.
BY JAHN RULEY


They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

This post by Pierre and Jerome is important and should be read- American
Poets are Myopically focused on their own small tradition and forget that
poetry is a global artform Poems for the Millenium did this for us in the
USA and that is what makes it a superior anthology to many others-

two by DAVID DANIELS
"The Flowers of Mental Illness" and "The Big Bozo"=20

Xerolage 34 features two new sequences by David Daniels
(http://www.thegatesofparadise.com), whose epic The Gates of Paradise
is featured at UbuWeb. Comprising twenty-two of his shape poems, "The
Flowers of Mental Illness" and "The Big Bozo" bear Daniels' torch of
unprecedented tradition with elaborate vispo compositions in his
signature medium, Microsoft Word. An obsessive devotion to carving out
micro-liberations in the totalizing and programmatic structure of
(the) Word is at the heart of this poet's formalist genius. If you
don't hear a verbalized music ringing contrapuntal thru the dialogue
in "Flowers," do unsolve the secret algorithm of visual spacing and
shaping that manifests as sonic landscaping in "The Big Bozo." Read
Xerolage 34 until the pictures fade or let your eyes cross dazed until
the words all blur, the pictures becoming the square root of their
unrooted presence. It's a trip either way you look at it. -

Entitled
You Play the Hand You're Dealt

You lay a bet
To see a card
The one you get
To play is hard
What can you say?
I've always felt
You play the hand you're dealt

One holds an ace
One has the trump
Whoever pays
Becomes the chump
Your winning ways
Can quickly melt
You play the hand you're dealt

A club, or spade
Diamond or heart
Whether you played
Suits dumb or smart
You had to stay
With cards you held
You play the hand you're dealt

To change the deal
Or beat the odds
We all appeal
To different gods
But though to pray
You may have knelt
You play the hand you're dealt

I've thought it out
I'm sure I'm right
Life is a bout
We have to fight
Though blows may stray
Below the belt
You play the hand you're dealt

Some folks we see
And may condemn
But who are we
To scoff at them?
Who knows how they
Have been compelled
You play the hand you're dealt

Mime-Version: 1.0

I can now way that I have seen the Redwood forests and the Gulf Stream
Waters, indeed, this land is for me.  Going to California just as the rains
returned to NYC was a blessing.  The weather out West was surreal— bright,
warm, very little of the SF fog. There had been a lot of rain this spring.
The blossoming trees, rose bushes, Mexican sage, birds of paradise,
bougainvillea, jasmine, cedar, and something that smelled faintly of cat
urine were everywhere.  Sue Heinemann, artist, editor and writer and
wonderful host took me all over Oakland from Piedmont Avenue to Lake
Merritt.

We went to Sausalito, which despite a lot of residential development remains
a most charming tourist town.   The shop where I used to get my dead Black
musician t-shirts (Robert Johnson, Charles Mingus, Billie Holiday) no longer
sells them because the market bottomed out.  Darn.  But they had other
colorful items, mostly silly and little and cheap. Also, a gallery that
sells really expensive tourist art was having an opening for a Russian
painter of dubious talent, but what was really weird were the Grace Slick
“paintings and drawings” upstairs.  They were expensive and dreadful and
while I love to hear GS lead the Jefferson Airplane, girlfriend should never
have taken brush to canvas.  I can’t wait, in a few years the same gallery
will be selling Prince drawings or Beyonce’s needlepoint.  This was the
first Saturday where all the weekend sailors could sail and they did. The
San Francisco Bay looked like a movie set. Hell even San Quentin looked
pretty from far away.

What was really precious about my trip was seeing Muir Woods, where the
Redwoods (last of them) stand thousands of years tall.  People actually
lower their voices while walking around.  And because there had been so much
rain earlier in the season, the stream that runs through the woods was full
and raging in a couple of places.

On Saturday night we went to hear jazz at Yoshi’s in Jack London Square.
What a wonderful place to hear music even if was Soulgrass-Bill Evans is
lightweight, but Bela Fleck is a fascinating player and the violinist was
terrific.  Also in Oakland is the Oakland Grill which actually lives up to
the hype. food was good.   I loved Oakland's waterfront.  But with clear
skies, white yachts, beautiful vegetable and fruits and people from all over
the planet selling wares, what’s not to like?  There's a picture of me
standing next to Jack London's Alaskan cabin.  It's small, filthy, but all
coins tossed through the window goes to UNICEF. I threw in a quarter to join
the pennies, nickels and dimes.

Back in NYC, it’s a sunny, almost warm Memorial Day.  It is a sad one too.
More than 2000 US service men and women have died in the “war on Terror”
most in Iraq and there is no end in sight.  There have been the usual
“poignant” stories of men cut down before they are 21, but most often there
are men and women past that age with wives and husbands and children left
behind.  We are creating a nation of orphans.

Can’t just blame this on Bush.  Americans are somnambulant about this
crisis.  It may be in peoples’ faces, but it is certainly out of their minds
and hearts.

As someone who as seen America from sea to shining sea and who cares deeply
about what is happening to this country—the thrashing of the Constitution
comes to mind—I don’t feel particularly hopeful.  It is not as if this
nation is at a crossroads, it feels more like we are on the Magic Bus
outfitted not by Merry Pranksters, but by financially comfortable, ruthless,
intellectually lazy, and pharmaceutically altered people who stay on the
path mapped by power mad and vicious people whose agenda is to never deviate
from their own designs even if the results will ultimately prove
catastrophic.  You can stay on the bus or get off.  I work hard to stay off
that bus.

Peace and beauty on this truly poignant Memorial Day.
Patricia Spears Jones

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

I accept the charge of having been "sucked into" writing poetry and have been committing this transgressive activity for over thirty years.  I have thousands of poems.  Although I don't feel "I" write them (they seem to have an existence independent of my ego at least when they're good) I nevertheless attach my name to the ends of them, thus they are "mine" in a sense.  Is this nonsense?  Not from a Buddhist perspective, if you understand what I mean.  As for poetry arriving soon, I hope it arrives or rearrives or whatever it takes to make it take more effect both for its own sake and for that of the world at large.

furniture_ press <furniture_press@GRAFFITI.NET> wrote:see, now i have issues with "alive"

but truth be told, you're dead on
in that response, concerning the
state of poetry, dying in our culture,
but there still being so much, too much
poetry out there. perhaps it's like
rotting food - someone will eventually
have to throw it out.

i don't think anyone has to feed poetry -
poetry is, i think, the act of
feeding. i don't see poetry as a thing
doing something but as doing being
something, trying to be something,
and that's the poetry that's rotting,
eating itself "alive" because, when
poetry becomes something, "alive", it
has to eventually go bad. food goes bad,
but you never see eating go bad.

poetry is like eating. period.
poetry is eating. itself, alive.

so like doing poetry should get us
in shape, but we're getting fatter.
or is the poetry getting fatter?
we're nothing i assume in the scheme
of poetry, just doers, who'll eventually
rot. but the poetry remains "alive", no,
not alive, it remains. period.

but it's all about approach, tom. it's
about time the poem do something
other than become something.

money (laugh track) - burroughs and gysin.

money is the laugh track in heaven.
applause sign (signal?) i think it reads
"applause" get it? fill in, an audience
"fills in" with an applause. it should
read "applaud". it should be a command.
viewers at home are like viewers on-set.

the onset of poetry is nigh! beware! don't
get sucked into poetry, writing poetry,
reading it. let poetry be, and will
come to you, fat, "alive", dreaming itself.

Dear friends,

I am looking for a theoretical text that deals with the difference between
"humor" (Nash) and the "comic" (Stevens) in the 20th century.  I am writing
an essay about comedy theory that includes Bergson, Wyndham Lewis, and
Breton, and I would like to begin by defining comedy as opposed to humor.

A NEW CONTEMPORARY READING SERIES
May 24, 2005--Lowell, Mass.  poet Michael Hoerman has partnered with Lowell’s Revolving Museum, Loom Press, members of the Lowell Poetry Network, and other donors, to launch an exciting new reading series in downtown Lowell.
The series will bring poets and writers of national and international reputation to Lowell for readings, talks, book signings, and panel discussions, pairing them in events with poets and writers from Lowell and nearby communities. A special debut event takes place on June 3rd at 7pm at the Revolving Museum, featuring internationally acclaimed poet Ilya Kaminsky.
Robert Pinsky described Kaminsky’s poetry as “passionate and daring.” Carolyn Forché said Kaminsky is “a poet of promise fulfilled.” That’s a tall order for any poet. Yet Kaminsky is an improbably young 29-years-old. And he is a Russian immigrant who writes in English, but has spoken the language only a few years. Perhaps most amazing of all, Kaminsky is legally deaf as the result of debilitating childhood illness.
Reading with Kaminsky will be Portsmouth novelist Katie Towler, whose Snow Island was a Barnes and Noble “Discover Great New Authors” selection. They will be joined by special guest, Lowell poet Matt Miller, recent winner of Stanford University’s prestigious Stegner Fellowship.
Michael Hoerman moved to Lowell in August from Cambridge. From 1994-99 he organized dozens of poetry readings and events in the Ozark Mountain region, including a poetry festival that was supported with a grant from Bravo/IFC. A frequent reader at events in Boston and NYC, Hoerman is currently Fellow in poetry of the Mass. Cultural Council.
This event is free, handicap accessible and open to the public. Refreshments will be served.

Is it true that Ubu is through?

The home page mentions that will be hosted by a school but no longer

Good luck and thanks ubu,
kevin
