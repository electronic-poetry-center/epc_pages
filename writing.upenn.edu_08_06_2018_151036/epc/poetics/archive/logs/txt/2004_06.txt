jonathan, fascinating and, at times, disturbing post... do you know
blitz/hurlbert's ~letters for the living:  teaching writing in a
violent age~ (ncte, 1998)?... it's aimed at college-level
instruction, but deserves to be much better known in general...

anyway, thanx for that---

best,

American poetry I've given you all and now nothing has been made to happen.
American poetry ten bucks per book, on average,
    June 1, 2004
I can't stand my short lines.
American poetry when will we end the avant-garde vs mainstream war?
Go fuck yourself with your perfect bound.
I don't feel good don't interview me.
I won't dislike my poem till I'm in my right mind.
American poetry when will you be less anaseptic?
When will you take off my clothes?
When will you stop looking at yourself in a convex mirror?
When will you be worthy of your dozens of Patchenites?
American poetry why are your libraries full of nervous children?
American poetry when will you export your writing software to China?
I'm quick to your insane demands.
When can I go into the Barnes and Noble and buy what I
         want with my reputation?
American poetry after all it is you and I who are perfect not
         the nonliterary world.
Your unofficial publicity machines are too much for me.
You made me want to be an English professor.
There must be some other way to settle your hash.
Jack Spicer is a book prize I don't think he'll come back
         it's sinister.
Are you being sinister or is this some form of impractical
         joke?
I'm trying to come up with a point, if not a manifesto.
I refuse to give up the microphone.
American poetry push harder till I know what I'm doing.
American poetry all the plum positions are taken.
I haven't read Poets and Writers for months, everyday
         somebody wins a prize for murdering verse.
American poetry I feel sentimental about the Fugitive poets.
American poetry I used to be a novelist when I was a kid
         I'm not sorry.
I blow smoke up the instructor's ass every chance I get.
I sit in my study for days on end and stare at the collected poems
         on the bookshelves.
When I give a reading I get drunk and never get paid.
My mind is made up to start trouble.
You should have seen me reading Ginsberg.
My adviser thinks I'm perfectly uptight.
I won't say homogenous.
I have a vibrating cosmos and a cosmic vibrator.
American poetry I still haven't told you what you didn't do for Professor
         Makeastir after he came over from alternative presses.

Are you going to let your poetical life be run by
         Silliman's Blog?
I'm obsessed by Silliman's Blog.
I read it every day, every hour in fact; sometimes more than that; I'm
reading it now.
Its comment box exchanges challenge me and push my mind to the deepest
         depths of critical thinking.
I read it in the open at a table in a cafe on my laptop where the chicks
can dig me.
It's always telling me about poetic lineage. Projective poets
         have lineage. Black Mountain poets have lineage.
         Everybody's got lineage but me.
It occurs to me that I am American poetry.
I am blogging to myself again.

The Iowa Workshop is rising against me.
I haven't got an endowed chairman's chance.
I'd better consider my poetical resources.
My poetical resources consist of two chapbooks of
         disjointed lyrics and dozens of bookmarked blogs an unreadable
         coterie literature that goes 200 saddle-stitched miles an hour
         and twenty-five-thousand in student loans.
I say nothing about my social networks nor the six or so
         panels who live in my web reports
         under the weight of five hundred applicants.
I have abolished the MFA programs of all state colleges, Naropa
         is the next to go.
My ambition is to be NEA chairman despite the fact that
         I'm a moron, and a partisan.

American poetry how can I flarf a holy litany in your mordant
         mood?
I will continue like the Vatican my parodies as
         constant as its hypocrisy more so they
         don't need much to eat.
American poetry I will sell you bandwith $2500 a width $500
         down on your old width
American poetry free Bob Perelman
American poetry save the Breadload Conference
American poetry the Poetics List must not die
American poetry I am the New Formalist boys.
American poetry when I was twenty-seven sommun took me to
         a writers conference they sold us T-shirts a
         T-shirt per ticket a ticket costs fifty bucks and the
         poetry were free everybody was cordial and
         sentimental about the 1970s it was all so sin-
         cere you have no idea what a good party the
         poetry was in 1995.
America you're in war up to your eyeball.
America poetry it's them unread barbarians.
Them slam poets them writing students and them tv-watchers.
         And them writing students.
The MFA wants to eat us alive. The MFA's tenure and book
         mad. He wants to take our dollars from out our
         accounts.
Her wants to grab Poetry (Chicago). Him needs a widely taught
         Anthology. Him wants our checks in book contests.
That no good. Ugh. Him make poets read Norton.
         Him need bigger audience. Hah.
American poetry this is kinda serious.
American poetry this is the impression I get from looking
         at the Internet.
American poetry: is this a wreck?
I'll letter write right down to the nob.
It's true I don't want to be a "visiting writer" or turn tricks
         for blurbs as we swap seats on the gravy train. I'm shy and
         socially awkward anyway.
American poetry I'm writing my own ticket to a meal.

American poetry I feel sentimental about the Fugitive poets.
American poetry I used to be a novelist when I was a kid
         I'm not sorry.
I blow smoke up the instructor's ass every chance I get.
I sit in my study for days on end and stare at the collected poems
         on the bookshelves.
When I give a reading I get drunk and never get paid.
My mind is made up to start trouble.
You should have seen me reading Ginsberg.
My adviser thinks I'm perfectly uptight.
I won't say homogenous.
I have a vibrating cosmos and a cosmic vibrator.
American poetry I still haven't told you what you didn't do for
Professor
         Makeastir after he came over from alternative presses.

Are you going to let your poetical life be run by
         Silliman's Blog?
I'm obsessed by Silliman's Blog.
I read it every day, every hour in fact; sometimes more than that; I'm
reading it now.
Its comment box exchanges challenge me and push my mind to the deepest
         depths of critical thinking.
I read it in the open at a table in a cafe on my laptop where the chicks
can dig me.
It's always telling me about poetic lineage. Projective poets
         have lineage. Black Mountain poets have lineage.
         Everybody's got lineage but me.
It occurs to me that I am American poetry.
I am blogging to myself again.

The Iowa Workshop is rising against me.
I haven't got an endowed chairman's chance.
I'd better consider my poetical resources.
My poetical resources consist of two chapbooks of
         disjointed lyrics and dozens of bookmarked blogs an unreadable
         coterie literature that goes 200 saddle-stitched miles an hour
         and twenty-five-thousand in student loans.
I say nothing about my social networks nor the six or so
         panels who live in my web reports
         under the weight of five hundred applicants.
I have abolished the MFA programs of all state colleges, Naropa
         is the next to go.
My ambition is to be NEA chairman despite the fact that
         I'm a moron, and a partisan.

American poetry how can I flarf a holy litany in your mordant
         mood?
I will continue like the Vatican my parodies as
         constant as its hypocrisy more so they
         don't need much to eat.
American poetry I will sell you bandwith $2500 a width $500
         down on your old width
American poetry free Bob Perelman
American poetry save the Breadload Conference
American poetry the Poetics List must not die
American poetry I am the New Formalist boys.
American poetry when I was twenty-seven sommun took me to
         a writers conference they sold us T-shirts a
         T-shirt per ticket a ticket costs fifty bucks and the
         poetry were free everybody was cordial and
         sentimental about the 1970s it was all so sin-
         cere you have no idea what a good party the
         poetry was in 1995.
America you're in war up to your eyeball.
America poetry it's them unread barbarians.
Them slam poets them writing students and them tv-watchers.
         And them writing students.
The MFA wants to eat us alive. The MFA's tenure and book
         mad. He wants to take our dollars from out our
         accounts.
Her wants to grab Poetry (Chicago). Him needs a widely taught
         Anthology. Him wants our checks in book contests.
That no good. Ugh. Him make poets read Norton.
         Him need bigger audience. Hah.
American poetry this is kinda serious.
American poetry this is the impression I get from looking
         at the Internet.
American poetry: is this a wreck?
I'll letter write right down to the nob.
It's true I don't want to be a "visiting writer" or turn tricks
         for blurbs as we swap seats on the gravy train. I'm shy and
         socially awkward anyway.
American poetry I'm writing my own ticket to a meal.

The Dangerous Consequneces of Groupthink and Mindless Conformity

    It has been suggested the NeoCons and Zionists who've plotted and
    planned the invasion of Iraq suffer from a level of groupthink that
    has rendered them and those who subscribe to their ideology
    incapable of recognizing that the truth about the insanity of their
    schemes and their tunnel vision has hardened their hearts to the
    suffering their plans have caused to both AmeriKKKans and innocent
    people around the world.

The Dangerous Consequneces of Groupthink and Mindless Conformity

POSITIVELY BLACK

Junious Ricardo Stanton

The Dangerous Consequences of Groupthink and Mindless Conformity

"Groupthink: thinking so dominated by the desire to maintain unanimity
of thought in a group that critical thinking is suspended or rendered
ineffective." - Dictionary of psychology

It has been suggested the NeoCons and Zionists who've plotted and
planned the invasion of Iraq suffer from a level of groupthink that has
rendered them and those who subscribe to their ideology incapable of
recognizing that the truth about the insanity of their schemes and their
tunnel vision has hardened their hearts to the suffering their plans
have caused to both AmeriKKKans and innocent people around the world.
Personally I think that is minimizing or rationalizing their evil a bit
too much. The NeoCons are not a bunch of frat boys or corporate bigwigs
who hang out on the golf course wagering who will make the tough shots
and then go about their button down wing tip lives wheeling, dealing and
shot calling as they watch their portfolios surge as the result of their
latest schemes. The madmen behind AmeriKKKan foreign policy aren't so
self absorbed they are oblivious to what people around them are saying.
No, they are much more cunning and calculating than that. In fact they
set the agenda so that once they determined they were going to bum rush
the world to expropriate the earth's natural and human resources they
willfully conspired to bamboozle the AmeriKKKan public into believing
their puppet George W Bush was a legitimate and viable political
candidate. They enlisted their colleagues in the press and mass media
who never questioned Bush's record on anything other than a few DWI
indiscretions, never delved into or examined his character or lack
thereof and refused to press him about campaign statements like his
pledge to increase the budget for defense despite the end of the Cold
War and no major ideological or geopolitical adversaries on the horizon.
Most people felt Cheney and Bush's father were the real shot callers and
many still believe this. However Cheney and even George H.W. Bush could
not have pulled off what we see going on in AmeriKKKa all by themselves,
even with the massive donations from their supporters in munitions,
pharmaceuticals, banking, Wall Street, the media and the oil industry.
They needed an infrastructure that was in place long before Bush took
office in 2001.

That infrastructure has been in place for quite some time. The ruling
elites and the Bush family are part of the New World Order shot calling
clique that had all their ducks in a row ready for a "Pearl Harbor like"
incident to do just what they are doing now; launching a pre-emptive
global war against sovereign foreign nations and finalizing the
Nazification of AmeriKKKa. Just as Adolph Hitler used the fire that
burned down the German parliament to usher in a reign of totalitarian
laws and Nazi rule; Bush and Co, the NeoCons, the Christian fanatics,
the rabid Zionists and their assorted ideological bedfellows have used
9-11 to push the envelope on their respective agendas. Now we see the
consequences of their narrow-minded groupthink in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The oil robbers are moving to wage war to expropriate the world's oil
supplies as well as other natural resources. The Ashkenazim Zionists are
determined to annex all the territory from the Tigris and Euphrates to
the Nile!. The invasion of Iraq was a major step in their program. Alas
for both groups their plans are unraveling due to the fierce resistance
of Iraqi freedom fighters and world opinion. It remains to be seen
whether or not the masses can keep the pressure on Bush, Blair and
Sharon to prevent them from going hog wild in their quest to bogart the
world's energy and natural resources and continue alienating the rest of
the world by their bonehead foreign polices and Bush and Blair's zombie
like determination to placate the Zionist agenda.

But the Neocons and Zionists aren't the only ones engaged in disastrous
groupthink. African-Americans have our share of non critical thinking
just to go along with the crowd. The notion that being successful in
anything other than entertainment or professional sports is trying to be
white is anathema to the liberation struggles our ancestors waged and
the ongoing battles for human rights, decency, self and group
actualization that still need to be fought. Another example of our
uncritical groupthink is our unwavering support of a Democratic Party
that has betrayed us repeatedly. How is it the descendants of the people
who built the pyramids, created vast empires throughout the continent of
Africa, spread enlightenment throughout the world now say that to aspire
to excellence is acting white? This groupthink belies a total ignorance
not only of our history and accomplishments but the real history of the
Caucasian race. To say that one attempting to develop his or her innate
genius and potential is trying to act white shows just how thorough and
successful our enemies' program of white supremacist menticide is. How
can we stand passively by and allow this mind set to flourish
unchallenged? Who is going to step up and set the record straight? This
is the crux of Bill Cosby's argument, his class biases aside. Yet we see
few in our community rallying around the notion we can do and be better
as all socio-economic strata ape the values and conspicuous consumption
lifestyles promoted by Madison Avenue and Hollywood. We need to resist
the dummying down of our people. When the one group of Caucasians the
rest of the Aryans hold up as their most civilized, the Greeks, were in
total awe of the civilizations of their African contemporaries how can
we dare think being smart is trying to be white?!! How can we think that
when we see how psychotic and inhumane the leadership of this nation is?
How can we say being successful is being white when we see what
Euro-AmeriKKKans and their European cohorts "civilization" is doing to
the earth's ecosystems and humanity? We need to turn off the television,
stop exposing ourselves uncritically to the mass media, begin teaching
critical thinking and discernment skills to our children. Most of all we
need to think for ourselves and begin defining our reality based upon
our African traditions and our shared experiences at the hands of
Caucasians (Arabs and Europeans) and act accordingly. That is the true
measure of intelligence.

Thanks for circulating the story CA.

I have to say I can now easily believe what is happening.

Here's a working link to the story:  http://tinyurl.com/2j9he

...the link originally included had worked.
anyway, to be honest, it was the link which had convinced
me that this was not some Internet urban legend.

although the story is outrageous, legal action will prevail
against the fascist scum running this school.

and, if anything, it's exactly these sort of attempts to censor
which make young poets like these students take notice of
how important their expressions really are.

it sounds corny to say poetry will not be stopped!
but it's still true, even if it sounds corny.

fuck all those who try to stamp out poetry!

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

WORKSHOPS

WORKSHOP ON EXPERIMENTAL POETRY with Jorge Guitart
4 Saturdays July 10, 17, 24, and 31, 10 a.m -12 p.m. in The Hibiscus Room at
Just Buffalo
$100, $90 members, individual classes $30, $25 members

If you are tired of the trite and expected in the poetry of others or your
own, try your hand at playing with language in a serious, organized way. Let
randomness and unusual combinatory procedures get you started in creating
lines that no one could possibly have uttered or written before. Bring
poetry back to being a most unusual collocation of words. Let the poem write
you instead of the other way. Embark on the pleasures of intertextuality,
stealing from famous texts and subverting their intentions. You will be
introduced to techniques that will help you create hundreds if not thousands
of amazing poems in a relatively short time.

Jorge Guitart teaches in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures
at UB. He has been a member of JBLC Writers in Education since 1984 and has
led poetry workshops in Buffalo public schools. He  is the author of
Foreigner's Notebook (Shuffaloff 1993) and Film Blanc (Meow Press 1996). He
is represented at UB's Electronic Poetic Center.

Dan----definitely one of the best takes I've seen on this
(i tried writing something similar this winter, but stopped
about ten lines into it....
the first line was something like
"American poetry I've given you all and now I'm $40,000 in debt."

Time to throw a house party- get down. Chris Strofolino threw a very good
one a few weeks back - he's still down(!). This is way too sad. It's even
funny. Time to get to the sink. Really get the poisons out. & start over.
Wink-wink.

Oh well, what can one really say? It's never been an easy show. Even Auggie
K has to come home at the end of the day.

Hiya,

sorry but this is being repeatedly rejected from the list. Not sure
why. Perhaps you coulf forward it.
I wanted to send it under a heading 'apropos of authorship':

commissioned as part of Silicon Fen for Norwich School of Art & Design
and Film and Video Umbrella:

TNWK's far from silicon fen

now online. It's a flash animation, requiring sound. About a five
minute download with a 56k modem, but will start running in under half
a minute on broadband.

The site has a comments book. Any and all feedback welcome.

In my PS from my last announcement I meant to offer thanks to Southern Neighbor for its generous support of the festival, but I mistyped its name as "Southern Neighborhood."  I apologize for the error.

Hope to see you at the festival this weekend.

Friends--

I'm in desperate need of the Charles Bernstein's
"correction tape" poem; I forget the title. If I
remember correctly, it appeared in the beginning of
K.David Jackson's Experimental-Visual-Concrete:
Avant-Garde Poetry Since the 1960s, which, sadly, I
don't have access to.

If anyone (including Charles Bernstein) has a copy of
it that they can scan in and email to me, I'd really
appreciate it.

Thanks so much,
Joseph

At Tabor Hill Nietzscheo Volcano Park the writing has stopped
the hours drip slowly in the diving bell and thrumming towers
sitting here at dusk who are my companions
faces 7 face of Dr. Ing La0

At Lungmanta Gay Science Destruction Hole the writing has plunged
the minutes boil on a grey velvet anvil where dynamites swarm
sitting here at midnight my friends are restless in my pores
their faces poke out, faces of high principle, 7 face
of Dr. Ing La0

At Lelecun Anti-Christ Bottle Factory the drinking has stopped
the writing drips slowly in the mordant fishbowl
sitting here at dawn what is my great companions
the heads of cillia have a single tortured body
now you look at 7 face of Dr. Ing La0'd

Maudite Productions hosts Loudmouth Collective and Ugly Duckling Presse
 June 5, 2004: Loudmouth Collective and Ugly Duckling Presse Present an Anti-ReadingGALLERY 108
108 Beacon Street, Somerville, MA

8 PM

Contact: Mark Lamoureux, Maudite Productions 617.460.0112



Loudmouth Collective began, ironically, with one member, James Hoff, sometime in the late winter/early spring of 2001. The collective's goal was to publish (chap)books of new work by some of the bright and underrated talents within the margins of the writing world. Furthermore, each publication would strive to challenge the typical physical appearance of the (chap)book.

By March 2001, Hoff had been joined by Ryan Haley and preparations had begun for the Anti-Readings, which were to be organized with the assistance of the members of Ugly Ducking Presse. Anti-Readings quickly became the major focus of Loudmouth activities for the next year; culminating in a triumphant Poetry Project Anti-Reading in March 2002.

During 2003, Loudmouth Collective had a retrospective show at Berlin's Elefant + Ship, a performance during the Virginia Festival of the Book, the premiere screening of Joel Schlemowitz's documentary Loudmouth Collective/Ugly Duckling Presse/Anti-Reading, and the release of Steve Dalachinsky's Trial and Error in Paris and Edmund Berrigan's I Feel Tractor.



Saturday, June 5, at Gallery 108 in Somerville, Massachusetts,  Loudmouth Collective founder James Hoff and Ugly Duckling Presse members Matvei Yanklevitch and Anna Moschovakis will be presenting another Anti-Reading.

It could have been a Sunday on the decayed Wednesday that slumped in a
corner, possibly afternooning, among the broken-down clocks that had taken
to the bottle, the fractured mathematics that had been spat out from the
skies like an old man's nightmare of teeth, the derelict abandoned odes and
burnt-out sonnets and the jigsaws with pieces missing of chairs, ballot
papers, breakthroughs in physics, bus route maps, menus, fashion tips on
hairdo's, does, doze, those

too many that assail the mind. Could've bin a Sunday. AutoPoet

blinked back into awareness and rue. Rivering, voicefaces pawed as they
poured past without pause. Pawed with tongues. AutoPoet protested to the
ghosts of anatomy. All lines were on hold. Roofless, the former dome

that didn't anymore arch above, ladled down dumpling clouds and a watery
shade of thin soupsky. Somewhereone offered a bottle of white cider.
AutoPoet refused and, as his ancient circuitry jiggled dying batteries
sustenance, despite the sudden iruptions of autobiographical epics and
scented monogrammed curtseying handkerchiefs, tried

for one last time: 'Frnkuhwr llollobdya hrrnwrr' echoed from the walls
(fall'n). As the black silhouette of a huge bird, like a bomber, shadowed
overhead. Speechlost, failed, AutoPoet drew his blanket of darkness about
his head, but, as consciousness ebbed, while calendars tore themselves apart
and clocks wound backwards and forwards, a voice within hummed:

'Tomorrow I shall tell you my name'. CuddabinaSunday, his mind slurred.

of your wire-frame heresy model,
paper-mashe' prophet
whose guts are tarred bird's nests
I sit you up in the plaza, make you look like
a speaker, Reel to Reel, pigeons and rats mutter

you say there are giant beings
you say whose bodies are infinitely complicated
biorganic machine-cities,
you say their brains' cells are human brains
in a great and clustering orgy of doom like frogs
you say we are families in the capillaries
like incest dolphins at play
you say..

your head is knocked off by an incoming basketball
and old wrens and sparrows come pooring out
with beards and spectacles, holding concrete tablets,
worms come out wearing alchemical football helmets
a hairy dolphin headed millipede wearing a persian safety cone hat
comes out with a walkman on

a couple of kids come over and apologize
to me, I'm hiding behind a bench,
in plain sight

I have a very soft banana
I forgot to eat
and I'm listening to the same Paul Harvey radio show
over
and
over
and
over
and
over

until someone pulls the little plastic cowskull
from out my ear:

"You want a TOFU-DOG, buddy?"

        Yesterday I posted a revised program for the Orono (Maine)
conference on the NPF website <www.ume.maine.edu/~npf/>
        I could also send it to anyone as an attached file. It's
revised as of June 1, so pretty settled down. The conference kicks
off June 23 with a Creeley reading and a tribute to Louis Zukofsky!

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Subject:      Artists Subpeonaed in U.S. Patriot Act Case
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Three artists have been served subpoenas to appear before a federal grand
jury that will consider bioterrorism charges against a university professor
whose art involves the use of simple biology equipment.

The subpoenas are the latest installment in a bizarre investigation in which
members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force have mistaken an art project for a
biological weapons laboratory (see background below). While most observers
have assumed that the Task Force would realize the absurd error of its
initial investigation of Steve Kurtz, the subpoenas indicate that the feds
have instead chosen to press their "case" against the baffled professor.

Two of the subpoenaed artists--Beatriz da Costa and Steve Barnes--are, like
Kurtz, members of the internationally-acclaimed Critical Art Ensemble (CAE),
an artists' collective that produces artwork to educate the public about the
politics of biotechnology. They were served the subpoenas by federal agents
who tailed them to an art show at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary
Art. The third artist, Paul Vanouse, is, like Kurtz, an art professor at the
University at Buffalo. He has worked with CAE in the past.

The artists involved are at a loss to explain the increasingly bizarre case.
"I have no idea why they're continuing (to investigate)," said Beatriz da
Costa, one of those subpoenaed. "It was shocking that this investigation was
ever launched. That it is continuing is positively frightening, and shows
how vulnerable the PATRIOT Act has made freedom of speech in this country."
Da Costa is an art professor at the University of California at Irvine.

According to the subpoenas, the FBI is seeking charges under Section 175 of
the US Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which has been
expanded by the USA PATRIOT Act. As expanded, this law prohibits the
possession of "any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system" without the
justification of "prophylactic, protective, bona fide research, or other
peaceful purpose." (See http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/175.html for
the 1989 law and http://www.ehrs.upenn.edu/protocols/patriot/sec817.html for
its USA PATRIOT Act expansion.)

Even under the expanded powers of the USA PATRIOT Act, it is difficult to
understand how anyone could view CAE's art as anything other than a"peaceful
purpose." The equipment seized by the FBI consisted mainly of CAE's most
recent project, a mobile DNA extraction laboratory to test store-bought food
for possible contamination by genetically modified grains and organisms;
such equipment can be found in any university's basic biology lab and even
in many high schools (see "Lab Tour" at
http://www.critical-art.net/biotech/free/ for more details).

The grand jury in the case is scheduled to convene June 15 in Buffalo, New
York. Here, the jury will decide whether or not to indict Steve Kurtz on the
charges brought by the FBI. A protest is being planned at 9 a.m. on June 15
outside the courthouse at 138 Delaware Ave. in Buffalo.

HELP NEEDED

Financial donations:
The CAE Defense Fund has so far received over 200 donations in amounts
ranging from $5 to $400. This is a wonderful outpouring of sympathy, but a
drop in the bucket compared to the potential costs of the case. To make a
donation, please visit http://www.caedefensefund.org/

Letters of support:
Letters and petitions of support from biologists, artists, and others,
especially those in positions of responsibility at prominent institutions or
companies, could be very useful. See http://www.caedefensefund.org/ for a
sample letter of support.

Legal offers and letters of support:
If you are a lawyer, offers of pro bono support or offers to write amicus
briefs would be very helpful.

BACKGROUND

Early morning of May 11, Steve Kurtz awoke to find his wife, Hope, dead of a
cardiac arrest. Kurtz called 911. The police arrived and, after stumbling
across test tubes and petri dishes Kurtz was using in a current artwork,
called in the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

Soon agents from the Task Force and FBI detained Kurtz, cordoned off the
entire block around his house, and later impounded Kurtz's computers,
manuscripts, books, equipment, and even his wife's body for further
analysis. The Buffalo Health Department condemned the house as a health
risk.

Only after the Commissioner of Public Health for New York State had tested
samples from the home and announced there was no public safety threat was
Kurtz able to return home and recover his wife's body. Yet the FBI would not
release the impounded materials, which included artwork for an upcoming
exhibition at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art.

While most observers assumed the Task Force would realize that its initial
investigation of Steve Kurtz was a terrible mistake, the subpoenas indicate
that the feds have instead chosen to press their "case" against Kurtz and
possibly others.

i've fallen victim to officialese.
i believe strongly that because there are substructures to my work,
that it far and away deeper than yours.
i believe that the codes and protocols that accompany my pieces
make them stronger than yours in every way.
i believe that the escape within the officialese, codes, and protocols
in my work is based on their presence which gains them immeasurable
strength.
in order i believe that human choice all the way around is weak,
that a degree of machinic intervention is absolutely necessary
for the production of meaning today.
i have been seduced by this belief, for which i offer few apologies,
it is the machine within me that holds back.
almost as a young girl on her first date.

i'm auctioning it off myself right here on poetics etc and the
proceeds will go to Poets in Need.  the main difference between the
pictured one (which already sold on ebay to someone on POETIX YAY!!)
is that in the one currently up for bidding has a magenta/orange warp
instead of a pink and red one. but the basic colors and patterns are
the same.  i'll take bids for the next week and then send it off to
the highest bidder. the "buy now" price is $200.  if it doesn't sell
i'll send it to Silent Witness, the domestic homicide awareness
organization that the other one went to; they're having another ebay

Congratulations on your beautiful work Maria.  I'm not in the
shawl-buying market (or in any market except grouting & caulking right
now) but I sure would look a lot more elegant in one of your human/magic
shawls than I do in my trusty Walmart Mexican horse blanket that doubles
as a rocking-chair cover when I not swaddled in it (the blanket not the
rocking-chair though I do tend to rock back and forth when I'm swaddled
in it -- and it's just dawning on me why -- I'm probably part
rocking-chair myself after all these years of sharing my blanket...)
Maria, you're a woman of much skill subtlety & humor.  God bless you!

An Othered South
at eyedrum, atlanta GA
Saturday, May 29

the 1 pm start time of the event was hampered by a number of factors,
although many of the poets were present and so the time wasn't wasted.
  Bob Grumman and others had plenty of time to tour the UNREADABILITY
pin up show in the halls (left over from the last language harm show)
and everyone got to know one another a bit and to have a sustained
period in which to ponder the tables full of books and mags.  Michael
Hoerman sat outside taking notes for quite some time in preparation for
the discussion of southern / experiment issues. Skip Fox was there with
three musicians, David Perry, Aaron Verrett & Lance Chance.  Jennifer
Stewart arrived.  Bill Lavender & Nancy Dixon.  Later on Brad Elliot
made the scene. from the APG; Mark Prejsnar, Randy Prunty, Tracey
Gagne, Dana Petersen, Seth Young, Michelle Reeves, Zac Denton and me
[John Lowther].  Robert Cheatham was on hand for a couple of hours.

at around 5 we started having a discussion about things southern and
things experimental.  this should all be recorded and i know going in
to a recap of what was said that i will be contradicted by the
recording and so while I will do the best i can to sketch out the shape
of the talk, it will be deformed. I've decided to embrace that and
allow myself to slip into writing what i wish i had said  (note: if you
were there and saw anything differently, please post to Bill's forum...
information at the bottom of this email).
*
I started us off with a few questions about Hank Lazar's essay from the
anthology. What do we get from it?  Does it describe what we are doing
or does it not?  Skip Fox seemed to feel that Hank's idea of 'kudzu
textuality' did speak in a meaningful way of his work. Skip noted the
idea of lushness, overabundance and so on that he felt was apt in
regards to his work and to the work of others in the anthology. I
suggested that one could look at Jake Berry, Andy di Michele, Jim
Leftwich and perhaps a few others and see something of this kudzu
textuality idea. Mark P. complicated this a great deal by putting Will
Alexander into the mix (one might have brought up Clayton Eschleman or
Robert Kelly) a move which makes great sense to me but tramples over
the "southern" as if it wasn't there. I brought up my concern that what
the essay offers is just an updated "Southern Literature" or southern
literature 2.0. Bill said he found this to be the best criticism of the
essay. I mentioned Hank's linkage between kudzu textuality and
spirituality and how for me, and for most of the atlanta folks, this
plank in the platform makes no sense in relation to our work or lives.
I suggested something along the lines of "family resemblances" as a way
of making connections between some of us.  There were interesting
comments from Bob Grumman and Michael Hoerman in here that I have lost
track of. I did notice that Michael seemed surprised to hear that some
of us were unhappy with the essay. One thing which made Michael's
comments both particularly interesting and at times somewhat impossible
for me to do much with was his firm conviction about the necessary
inter-relations of rural experience and southern poetry which he traced
back to the transcendentalists and  with reference to many folks along
the way (Stanley Kunitz for instance).  Michael's position is pretty
traditional in this regard and his sources canonical in most instances.
Mark Prejsnar replied that the american transcendentalists and other of
Michael's references were simply not his and in many ways not ours (the
APG's? some larger slice of those attending?) instead offering Gertrude
Stein and a different list of poetic lights.  What if anything does
connect us? was asked again to no response.
*
we touched on regionalism for a time. I didn't feel that this
conversation was very productive but others i have talked with did.
perhaps they will post something to the forum about it? (again, see
instructions at the bottom of this post) Bill was aligning regionalism
with team spirit. Michelle was coming at it from a different direction
and placing region in regionalism as one puts sex is sexism or race in
racism. I think that it was during this stretch of the day that i
mentioned the APG's localism (4 of us once lived in one apartment
complex!) and tried to think through this very overdetermining
experience of mine to ask what else is going on in the south. I noted
the 'solitaries'.. folks like Jake Berry and Skip Fox and Bob Grumman
(Clayton Couch could have been added and A. di Michele tho now he is in
Delaware). All are reasonably well known poet folk who are not hermits
or anything, but they live and write in places where there is no group,
scene, or society of poetry geographically local to them. i contrast
this to new orleans which seems to me to be a poetry scene. there is a
long standing reading series that is open to almost anything (thus
courting all the dumbing down aspects of open mic poetry) but which has
not been abandoned by many of the more interesting poets in town. new
orleans seems to have a number of overlapping cliques. i don't mean
cliques in a bad way, simply as a description. new orleans also has a
number of poetry institutions, the magazines fell swoop and exquisite
corpse and the late mesechabe, the reading/speaking series Lit City,
Bill's Lavender Ink press, and the elusive but fascinating School of
the Imagination. so when i say a scene, what i mean is something like
this with different institutions or sub-groupings of the poetry scene.
when you have readings in new orleans people generally show up, the
crowds kick ass on atlanta for instance.  the north carolina scene
seems to be bubbling nicely as well and here i am not quite sure i know
what i am looking at.  ken rumble, my primary contact in this region
suggests to me that the Lucifer Poetics Group seems to him much like
the APG, but the lucipo list that they run there makes it seem like
there are many more poets involved than i had the impression and some
are writing and sending from California and Michigan and so forth.
Perhaps my idea of regional is out of whack? perhaps these folks are
locals on vacation or summer jobbing someplace?  i may be entirely
incorrect and would welcome clearing insight into it, but i suspect
that the lucipo list scene and north carolina as a poetry region is
doing something a bit larger than a scene and more like i dunno what...
shall i call it a society? i am at a loss for the best word. their
carboro poetry festival is this weekend and i wish i could go.  to an
extent this suggests to me a sort of 'umbrella poetics' which i
compared to the Staten Island Poetry Festival that Randy Prunty and I
attended this past year. implicitly and explicitly in all of this i
brought up and contrasted the APG experience here in atlanta. part of
why we do so many things at eyedrum and why two of are now board
members is that there is no 'scene' in atlanta along the lines of new
orleans or 'society' ala what is blooming in NC. we are it with very
few exceptions (Seaberg Acrobatic Poetry for instance), and so we've
made common cause with artists in other media and depended on arts
scene here for developing an audience. now with the development of the
eyedrum's new imprint THE NAMELESS and it's Literary Committee perhaps
things will start picking up even more. [I am very conscious of there
being something unsaid in all this comparison of different poetry
places and the social organizations in each, alas, it is something i am
not sure how to say.. and when i brought all this up saturday i was no
more able to take.. the .. next.. step.. than i am now.]
*
somehow we touched briefly on the civil war.
*
eventually we moved on from this to some interesting but inconclusive
discussion of what options are available to us as "southern
experimentalists."  here again i am reCreating in the recap things
which i wish i had said or wish i had said more clearly and probably
things i think people said but which they didnt. (is it silly to keep
saying that sort of thing? do we all take it for granted that our
witnesses are biased, blind in one eye and partying heavily during the
time about which they are reporting?) ...anyway, i know i asked
something about what our options were? what hopeful future we could
imagine for the ourselves as southern / experimental writers. Mark P
noted his abhorrence of terms like avant garde, innovative,
experimental etc.. we all seemed uncertain about the terms but i noted
here as in most discussions that we have a difficult time doing without
them.  the family resemblances thing came up again. it seemed that
everyone was interested in greater interconnections in this region, in
the possibility of having annual southern poetry events in other places
like pensacola fl and north carolina. and as the talk broke up to
finally reap the rewards of Dana's massive feed the poets cookout and
feed, i heard a few other ideas floating -- a database of southern poet
contacts and readings-organizers to facilitate reading tours of the
south (Mark Salerno took advantage of this, reading in N.O., ATL and NC
in a few days... it would be great to see more poets swing thru!)
*
so, after more drinking and partying we lurched into the 'readings'
period of the evening.  I played a CD titled "slam" from the Vernon
Frazer Poetry Band for awhile [Vernon Frazer voice w. Richard McGhee,
Stephen Scholz and Brian Johnson].
*
then we began the projection stuff.
*
watched a DV submission from Alex Rawls reading from the forthcoming
3rdness chapbook of Gatsby poems. Alex's video was pretty damned funny.
Bill panned around so we could see the extensive collection of
Simpson's figurines in the background and other curious things. Alex
donned a shriner hat with tassle then mentioned that in N.O. all poets
write about hats wear hats to read etc, its a hat poem thing. (is this
true or half true or an outright fiction?) then he introduced the poems
and the karaoke began with alex reading (mouthing) silently on video
while Nancy Dixon read aloud.  This was really fun, as we watched Alex
stop mouthing now and then and Bill again toured the shelves in
close-up. Once alex began speaking again before Nanc was done and
another time she finished  well before him. the film closed with a
phone call from Alex's landlord which he then explained. punch line "so
we're gonna store stuff in the dead people's apartment."
*
watched a VHS submission from Andy di Michele which we miraculously
saved from a thorough trouncing in the mails. this video was very
weirdly intimate, with sunset's reddish coloring fading to blue but
only as refected on andy's clothes and face, and most especially his
hands. he read in a very calm measured way through a selection of his
work, seeming at times to be improvizing a bit. the camera moved in a
semi-random way across his body giving us close-ups of ears and hands
and cloth. andy's very distinctive way of using his hands while he
reads was in full view, and even became the sole focus of the video at
times. a few laughed when the camera showed his feet and we noted that
his toes are just as busy as his hands while he reads. his piece ended
with him saying something akin to "the phenomenology of the southern
experiment is the gawk" and then looking straight into the camera as
the movie ended.
*
Next we watched the DVD from the Lucifer Poetics Group with it's scary
poodle.
*
Ken Rumble opened the disc followed by Joe Donohue and then Tessa
Joseph. This DVD was "professionally" shot  with fades to black and
titling and shots of the audience (supposedly) listening.it was a
pretty well put together collection and then technology struck and my
commercial DVD player began balking at Evie Shockley's section of the
dvd. initially it crated a digital fuck-up sound poem which we all sat
listening to in some shock as it really did sound pretty cool. but the
things which the digital glitching did to her face on the screen (big
as a movie!) were downright Francis Bacon sort of frightening so i
jumped up, ejected the disc, cleaned it and tried again. it played
differently but we were unable to hear Evie read and missed the work of
Amy Carroll completely. -- a few comments here. Ken smiles all the
time. the poodle is a bit creepy on camera. Joe's stuff reminded me of
various things and i think i would have rather had text in front of me
to appreciate it. Tessa seemed nervous on camera and it was rather
endearing. Evie had just begun, as i note above, when everything went
wrong, BUT, we all felt a loss when she was interrupted by glitch as
she had brought up the issue of race and southern identity and everyone
wanted to know where it wold go from there i think. *** fortunately, i
have since then been able to watch the whole DVD on a computer and was
pleased to hear Evie and Amy both speak a bit more about poetics. I
feel as if i am giving this bunch of poetry less comment than it
perhaps deserves, but unlike with Alex & Andy above, all of this work
is new to me and i long to see it on the page (perhaps you Luciferians
will post your poems to Bill forum?).
*
next (i think) a small pink teddy bear read James Sanders' poem "Owen
Wilson"
*
[sequence is very questionable from here on]
*
two polyphons by Mark Prejsnar were performed, before the intermission
Randy Prunty, Tracey Gagne and he did his "How Dare You, or five
crimson doves" a polyphon based on the dictionary of regional english.
then later in the 2nd half his "corrosive well waters of the western
desert" was done by myself, Zac Denton and Mark.
*
Skip Fox and Live Capture Remix performed.  This is Skip and three
musicians, David Perry, Aaron Verrett & Lance Chance.  LCR used phrase
samplers and other digital effects to process Skip's voice, listening
carefully and taking pieces of it out to echo or distort in various
ways. at one point Skip told them to get a little louder and i think
things got immediately more intense and exciting as the three musicians
began displacing the live voice of Skip with echoes and distortions of
it.  If i understood correctly Skip has been working with these guys
for a couple of years and it was cool for me to see him complicating
the page somewhat in his recent work. very cool.
*
Bill read a sort of poem/essay (available at the forum) called "poetry
politics place" which i liked a lot and which surprised me and many
others by bringing a bunch of us into it's text as names/references
*
Tracey Gagne read a selection of poems including one of my faves called
something like"conversation overheard on a cellphone" which repeated in
many permutations the word OTHER which came up so much during the day
*
Micheal Hoerman read a few poems, mostly i believe from his chapbook
Bad Rotten. they were funny and violent and surreal in juxtapositions
yet very much poems of a certain voice.
*
During the intermission I played Cheryl Pallant's work toward the end
of which she asks about going out for a drink (Randy said, "OK, i'll
go"). something i noticed a lot in Cheryl's work was a sense of either
a. my mis-hearing a word 'slightly'  or b. her mispronouncing a word
'slightly' with this slightly being one that produces an interesting
effect. again, seeing the work while hearing it would be ideal.
*
I also played Michael Rothenberg's CD "Under the Spell" (with musician
Bobby Thomas) for a bit before we resumed.  not sure what to say about
this disc or any reactions to it, i got distracted and had to take a
bathroom break and missed much of it's time on the player.
*
Randy Prunty read his recent sound poem extravaganza "East Lake" to
enormous positive response.
*
Jennifer Stewart an past student of Bill's who was on her way to NOLA
from up north somewhere read a poem or three. they were all very
sexual, erotic even. i was uncertain of what connections Jennifer might
have made to southern experimental writing. would be curious to know.
*
I read some collaborative poems done with Dana Petersen (our almost
finished book!) then she read more of her own. She concluded with a
collab poem done with Seth Young.  This little stretch was useful in
showcasing the APG's collaborative writing which was otherwise hard to
see or hear at this event.
*
Bob Grumman read some notes toward a lecture which I believe concerned
a poem he was thinking of writing. I very much look forward to hearing
the recording as i missed  good bit of Bob's talk for some reason.
*
Zac Denton read a few poems, some of which were from his brand new
3rdness chapbook NORMAHLWELKINGS which had it's official release at the
an othered south event.  something like 25 copies of this chap were
taken!
*
Michelle Reeves read from her Dectets and some other poem too i
believe. She also split her reading with some in the 1st half and some
in the 2nd.
*
Brad Elliot, who had driven in from Tennessee and who drove back
afterward, read a poem (again, posted at Bill's archive) which
surprised me very pleasantly. it was quite political and full of cool
lines. i had thought Brad was a writer of plays primarily (maybe he is)
but liked this stuff quite a bit.
*
Seth Young read a few poems from his long sequence "river we are
carried by"
*
Zac Denton and the Live Capture Remix joined me on a piece to close the
evening, another of my Johnny Minotaur improvizations. I was pretty
pleased with the way the piece went and enjoyed working with the LCR
guys a lot. Zac played violin.
*
we finally came to a halt sometime after midnight.

ok. that was my exhaustive report. who did i forget? i'm sure i have
forgotten someone and i apologize in advance. there were some very sad
absences, i very much wanted to see Andy di Michele at the event, he's
one of my oldest poetry friends and he's never been able to visit.
Hank Lazar had to cancel sort of last minute and that's a shame as his
essay was discussed a good bit (his more recent piece in the boston
review has been a topic for the lucipo list in n.c.) and his
perspective on many of the question raised in the afternoon would have
been much appreciated. the folks from the fiction collective were
struck with sudden emergencies and illnesses and so they couldnt come
(tho they sent books!). it also sucks that anyone who wanted to come
couldnt-- which goes for too many for me to easily list here.

there was a piece in the local weekly about the conference, or sort of
about it at least. is it that hard to get a straight answer out of me?
you can find it here;
http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/2004-05-27/arts_shelfspace.html

Bill's forum is set up here.  it would be great to get any diverging
views of the event from any other participants and even better to see
some more southern poets shaken out of the woodwork.

Here's a call from Jeff Gray. I apologize if the

And now on to Jeff Gray:

Dear colleague:

I and my co-editors are writing to invite you to
contribute to The Greenwood Encyclopedia of American
Poetry, a reference work covering American poetry from
its beginnings to the present.  The Encyclopedia will
be the most thorough and inclusive work of its kind to
date, including more than a thousand entries on poets,
critics, poetic terms, and movements. Entry length
varies from 100 to 5,000 words, with poet entries
usually ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 words.

We invite you to consult www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eoap,
where the lists of entries are posted and frequently
updated to reflect assignments to contributors. To
view the entries, click “entries” at the website, and
enter the password “a2zed” (as in A-Z) at the prompt.
To express interest in writing particular entries,
please respond as follows:

For 20th-century poet entries: grayjeff@shu.edu
For pre-20th-century entries: balkunma@shu.edu
For topic entries: mccorkle@capital.net
Please submit a curriculum vitae along with your
request for a given entry or entries.

We are particularly interested in contributors to
write on pre-20th century poetry, as we have many
unassigned entries in that area.

Entries will be due approximately four months from the
date of assignment, except in the case of the longest
entries and multiple entries, for which longer times
may be determined.  Guidelines for writing, as well as
sample entries, are available at the site. Entries
should be submitted as MS-Word attachments and
simultaneously mailed as diskettes to Jeffrey Gray,
Department of English, Seton Hall University, South
Orange, NJ 07079.

Note that the poet entries are, for present purposes,
broken into periods (pre-20th century and 20th
century), and that the topic entries are listed
separately.  In published form, all entries will be
listed A-Z continuously, irrespective of period or of
entry type.  Note also the absence of entries on
particular poems.  The encyclopedia’s approach will be
to include discussion of key poems within the entries
on specific poets.

We anticipate that, as the only encyclopedia covering
American poetry and poetics with this wide a span and
this great a specificity, The Greenwood Encyclopedia
of American Poetry will be the definitive reference
tool in the field and will be consulted widely by
students and scholars of American literature. We hope
you will offer your own expertise and scholarship in
giving it shape.

Sincerely yours,                                        Advisory Board:
                                                Steven Gould Axelrod, University of

ARTISTS SUBPOENAED IN USA PATRIOT ACT CASE
Feds STILL unable to distinguish art from bioterrorism
Grand jury to convene June 15

             HELP URGENTLY NEEDED - SEE BELOW

Three artists have been served subpoenas to appear before a federal =
grand jury that will consider bioterrorism charges against a university =
professor whose art involves the use of simple biology equipment.=20

The subpoenas are the latest installment in a bizarre investigation in =
which members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force have mistaken an art =
project for a biological weapons laboratory (see end for background). =
While most observers have assumed that the Task Force would realize the =
absurd error of its initial investigation of Steve
Kurtz, the subpoenas indicate that the feds have instead chosen to press =
their "case" against the baffled professor.

Two of the subpoenaed artists--Beatriz da Costa and Steve Barnes--are, =
like Kurtz, members of the internationally-acclaimed Critical Art =
Ensemble (CAE), an artists' collective that produces artwork to educate =
the public about the politics of biotechnology. They were served the =
subpoenas by federal agents who tailed them to an art show
at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. The third artist, Paul =
Vanouse, is, like Kurtz, an art professor at the University at Buffalo. =
He has worked with CAE in the past.

The artists involved are at a loss to explain the increasingly bizarre =
case. "I have no idea why they're continuing (to investigate)," said =
Beatriz da Costa, one of those subpoenaed. "It was shocking that this =
investigation was ever launched. That it is continuing is positively =
frightening, and shows how vulnerable the PATRIOT Act has made freedom =
of speech in this country." Da Costa is an art professor at the =
University of California at Irvine.

According to the subpoenas, the FBI is seeking charges under Section 175 =
of the US Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which has been =
expanded by the USA PATRIOT Act. As expanded, this law prohibits
the possession of "any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system" =
without the justification of "prophylactic, protective, bona fide =
research, or other peaceful purpose." (See =
http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/175.html for the 1989 law and
http://www.ehrs.upenn.edu/protocols/patriot/sec817.html for its USA
PATRIOT Act expansion.)

Even under the expanded powers of the USA PATRIOT Act, it is difficult =
to understand how anyone could view CAE's art as anything other than a =
"peaceful purpose." The equipment seized by the FBI consisted mainly of
CAE's most recent project, a mobile DNA extraction laboratory to test =
store-bought food for possible contamination by genetically modified =
grains and organisms; such equipment can be found in any university's
basic biology lab and even in many high schools (see "Lab Tour" at =
http://www.critical-art.net/biotech/free/ for more details).

The grand jury in the case is scheduled to convene June 15 in Buffalo, =
New York. Here, the jury will decide whether or not to indict Steve =
Kurtz on the charges brought by the FBI. A protest is being planned at
9 a.m. on June 15 outside the courthouse at 138 Delaware Ave. in =
Buffalo.

HELP NEEDED

Financial donations:
The CAE Defense Fund has so far received over 200 donations in amounts =
ranging from $5 to $400. This is a wonderful outpouring of sympathy,but =
a drop in the bucket compared to the potential costs of the case. To =
make a donation, please visit http://www.caedefensefund.org/

Letters of support:
Letters and petitions of support from biologists, artists, and others, =
especially those in positions of responsibility at prominent =
institutions or companies, could be very useful. See =
http://www.caedefensefund.org/ for a sample letter of support.

Legal offers and letters of support:
If you are a lawyer, offers of pro bono support or offers to write =
amicus briefs would be very helpful.

BACKGROUND

Early morning of May 11, Steve Kurtz awoke to find his wife, Hope, dead =
of a cardiac arrest. Kurtz called 911. The police arrived and, after =
stumbling across test tubes and petri dishes Kurtz was using in a =
current artwork, called in the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

Soon agents from the Task Force and FBI detained Kurtz, cordoned off the =
entire block around his house, and later impounded Kurtz's computers, =
manuscripts, books, equipment, and even his wife's body for further =
analysis. The Buffalo Health Department condemned the house as a health =
risk.

Only after the Commissioner of Public Health for New York State had =
tested samples from the home and announced there was no public safety =
threat was Kurtz able to return home and recover his wife's body. Yet
the FBI would not release the impounded materials, which included =
artwork for an upcoming exhibition at the Massachusetts Museum of =
Contemporary Art.

While most observers assumed the Task Force would realize that its =
initial investigation of Steve Kurtz was a terrible mistake, the =
subpoenas indicate that the feds have instead chosen to press their =
"case" against Kurtz and possibly others.

Soprano sax master Steve lacy died this morning
after a struggle with liver cancer, in Brookline,
MA.

I was fortunate enough to see Mr. Lacy perform
many times over the past several years in the Bay
Area, the most memorable of which was an
un-publicized solo set at the now defunct
Sweatshop on Mission St. I also helped present an
evening at Noe Valley Ministry when Steve was
touring with Roswell Rudd in support of their
fantastic Verve album of mostly Monk tunes. Two
sets, both completely sold out, each one amazing,
soulful, and utterly different, although the tunes
were the same...

Another time, I was left in charge of a show at a
church in the East Bay -- help me out here, I
can't remember what it was called -- St. John's?
Steve and Irene had a beautiful dressing room
somewhere upstairs in the huge church complex,
complete with a baby grand piano and bowls of
fruit and wine, etc., and I left them alone there
to see to the box office. When I came back, I
discovered they'd been rudely kicked out by the
attendees of an AA meeting who usually used that
room. While Irene ranted and raved, Steve calmly
fingered his sax and said softly, "We've been
kicked out of paradise, man..."

A great sadness: Steve Lacy passed away earlier today. He was one of
the greatest soprano sax masters of all times, a superb song writer
(over 250 songs in the last twenty years) -- working in close
collaboration with his wife, the singer Irene Aebi --, and a major
reader & connaisseur of poetry (the source for his lyrics). He was also
a wonderful friend to those who knew him, and one of the finest &
gentlest human beings it has been my pleasure to know. He will be
greatly missed.

Work


(Adapted from State of West Virginia Department of Mines Inspection Report
Number 14, 1956)

I keep a weekly record of old works, airways and escape ways.
I make air measurements every two weeks and keep a record with pen or
indelible pencil.
I see a travelway with the air intake to all sections in the mine, and a
hoist when the intake is a shaft.
I examine idle and abandoned sections of the mine three hours before
employees are permitted to enter.
I do not leave a dangerous place until it is made safe.
I wear a hard hat and hard-toed shoes.
When I am grinding, I wear goggles and when cutting, welding, or striking
where particles may fly I wear other eye protection.
I remove the front ends of cutter bars while the machine is being trammed.
I use roof bolt drill bits less than one and three-eights inches in
diameter.
I confine the roof bolts.
I remove all cuttings from drill holes before explosives are placed in the
hole.
I use only one kind of explosive in a shot hole.
I do not use coal dust or inflammable material for tamping.
I stem holes tightly and full to the mouth.
I use wooden tamping bars.
I do not use fuses of squibs.
I use metal scrapers attached to wooden tamping bars not more than eight
inches in length.
I insert blasting caps in line with the explosives, not at an angle.
I keep the leg wires of electric blasting caps shunted until connected for
firing.
I fire shots promptly after charging.
I warn persons that shots are to be fired so that they may withdraw to a
place of safety.
I warn persons not to return to the face after a shot.
I shoot coal from the Solid-Places Rock-Dusted to the face.
I roll up shooting cables when not in use.

Pierre:

Yes, thanks for pointing out Steve's special
relationship to poetry. Much of Steve's music was
inspired by poetry, and he had vast amounts of it
committed to memory (one of my favorite moments in
the Sweatshop show here in SF was when he paused
to recite a whole Melville poem by heart). In
fact, what stands out to me about his music is the
poetic-ness of it; his lines were always based on
breath, to an extent that forefronted this aspect
of his playing far more fluently than other horn
players'; there was never a wasted tone or sound.

I wonder if others who are familiar with his music
might recommend their favorite recordings for
those who want to check him out; there's so much
to choose from. For me, since the duet work with
Irene was so often not to my taste, his album
Remains stands out. Pure solo work. Based on his
readings in the Tao te ching. Fantastic, haunting
stuff.

One more thought: while Steve might have cashed in
and watered down his sound to play the jazzfest
circuit, he never stopped experimenting and
pushing boundaries and insisting on his own
musical path, and he performed in small or
mid-size venues right up to the end...

Best,

DH

despite appearances, I do not reserve my grieving for jazz masters who work with
poets --

But this is such a loss -- Lacy did some beautiful settings of poetry throughout
his long and pwerful career -- I'll spend the rest of the weekend listening to
my collection of his work,,,,,

thanks for this sad news, pierre.  i saw him several times in
mpls/stpaul and each time was happy to have done so; the last time, a
couple of years ago, he played from his beat suite, songs of bob
kaufman among others.

'crops' (Quark Records, 1979)

brings the ariculate spatiality of the solo works and the
fierceness of the band's version of the last time they played 'The Woe'
'the principal music we performed during the last two years of the
USA's involvement in Vietnam' together on one disc.

plenty of others, but that's my pick

possibly 'Anthem' (Novus 1989) on CD if you want the range of the
band's work. But there will be a plenitude of suggestions raining here
for sure.

love and love

Dear Pierre

My condolescenes to you. I wanted to once again thank you for introducing us
at your party in Albany back circa 94. I'm always intimidated around older
celebrities, but he was very down to earth, as was Irene---a pleasure to
listen to (oh yeah and all that music he did too....!)...

Chris

Agh, the pits.  What an incredible body of work he leaves.  They're not his most
unique or important contribution, perhaps, but I've always been nuts about his
versions of Monk tunes from the late 50s (Four in One, Skippy etc) w/ Waldron,
Elvin Jones et al.  And a nice reminder that he was there when the New Thing
jazz and the New American Poetry were colliding.  Michael Gizzi and I were
planning on hosting a Creeley/Lacy performance in Providence this Fall.  Alas.

Some eight or nine years ago (as Chris Stroffolino remembered) I=20
brought Steve Lacy & Irene Aebi up to Albany for a concert. Below is my=20=

little introduction for that evening (in fact a reduced version of the=20=

liner notes I wrote for FUTURITIES, Steve's 'opera' on poems by Robert=20=

Creeley)  -- offered here, tonight, as a first quick homage to the man=20=

& his work. Playing in the background right now is the cd MOMENTUM,=20
with many of Steve's long-time sidekicks: Steve Potts on saxes, Bobby=20
Few on piano, JJ Avenel on bass, Oliver Johnson on drums and, of=20
course, Irene Aebi "on" voice.

Pierre

[Intro for Steve & Irene (Albany, 94 or 5?)]=A0

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Roughly 10 years ago I was in Paris =
working on a radio=20
program about the poet Robert Creeley. Rather than fall back on the=20
aseptic atmosphere of the studio, I wanted to find live situations in=20
which to record the poet reading from his work. Creeley's poetry being=20=

obviously rooted in jazz, the idea immediately came to me of getting=20
him together with my then neighbor on the rue du Temple, the great=20
soprano saxophonist & composer Steve Lacy =97 a musician I knew to be an=20=

intelligent & passionate reader of poetry.=A0The two hit it off=20
wonderfully; the program was duly recorded & went over great. It became=20=

my habit to fall by Lacy's place every so often & over the years I was=20=

able to witness how he wrote some of the songs based on poems.

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Lacy has written hundred of songs =97 =
in fact I have heard the=20
rumor of 2000! =97 with poems (from Osip Mandelstam & Kurt Schwitters to=20=

Anne Waldman & Bob Kaufman) or other texts as lyrics, an art that has=20
always fascinated me. He has walked & talked me through the development=20=

of some of them, & here is some of what he had to say: "I've been=20
setting lyrics to music for almost twenty years now. It took a long=20
time to come to the surface =97 that stuff has got to age, to mellow=20
out... We use all kind of texts, some I wrote myself, but also=20
telegrams, letters, things found on the street, children's exercises,=20
slogans pulled off billboards =97 what you may call found poetry =97 but =
it=20
all comes down to poetry or lyrics =97 to word-setting. Lyrics were sort=20=

of petering out in the fifties and that's where I came in.=A0I guess =
it's=20
my job to bring them back." And what a job he has done of it, in terms=20=

of composing, arranging and playing! He has of course the help of his=20
companion, the singer & violinist Irene Aebi. Says Lacy: "Now the=20
reason all this has been possible is that I have had a voice to work=20
with =97 Irene's voice, a voice like an instrument. We started from zero=20=

together, me and her and the words made the music, but without the=20
voice to experiment with it wouldn't have happened. She has a gifted=20
voice, a voice you can't ignore or leave idle =97 it was my pleasure to=20=

find things that would fit it. It's been a real adventure for about 18=20=

years now."

=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Back on the topic of how one actually =
gets to find musical=20
ideas to go with a given text, Steve explained: "The thing about=20
setting words to music, you have to be able to deliver them over and=20
over again without boredom, without fatigue. You have to place them in=20=

musical pictures so that they can be sung. A poem is said again and=20
again and if it is said enough times it becomes a song. That's the way=20=

I find the music, by saying the words over and over again until it=20
becomes sing-song or song-sing, whatever, until it begins to take on=20
musical appearances." It is a few years later now, Lacy's discography =97=20=

already way over the hundred mark =97 has been enriched by a number of=20=

cd's presenting primarily his & Irene Aebi's 'art songs,' & I keep=20
listening to them & wanting more. As a poet my concerns have a lot to=20
do with fixed and open forms. Lacy's songs have taught me much along=20
those lines. How to keep a form open, for example, while at the same=20
time giving it a fixed center. Pound's "Unwobbling pivot" that must not=20=

be allowed to become a straightjacket strangling free movement &=20
improvisatory development.

=91Nuff said. Now for the real stuff. Please welcome Steve Lacy & Irene=20=

Aebi.

notes towards a phenomenology of motion-capture manipulation


the linkages in mc are graphs characterized by connectivity and linkage
length.
the linkages in mc are contingent to the geomatics of the body itself.
the mapping is fuzzy and one-to-one.
mappings can be changed. from an _external_ viewpoint, affine and other
transformations: scale, rotation, translation.
from an _internal_ viewpoint: fold, cut, split, join, and any conceivable
remapping, including those approaching the implicate order.
from an external viewpoint: identity read from equivalence.
from an internal viewpoint: the potential of inversion and other
topological mappings.
in the graphs, all nodes/linkages are conventional; by virtue of
contingency, they have the potential to fly apart.
flying apart: _stack_ or _heap._ in the stack, order is preserved and it
is a simple matter to reconstitute the mapping.
in the heap, order is chaotic; reconstitution depends on the links
remaining intact.
consider the linkage _parasitic_ in relation to the nodes: holding
dispersion in check. in this sense order is parasitic on disorder.
neutrality: any mapping is equivalent to any other mapping.
responsibility: nodes are responsible to their linkages. linkages are
responsible to their nodes.
abandonment: a node may be abandoned. an abandoned node has no linkage.
a linkage exists by virtue of its nodes; there are no abandoned linkages.
metaphoric: every remapping inscribes the ascription of meaning.
culture is discovered in the remappings. what is applied to mc of the body
is applicable to any mc, of any named entities.
the graphs of any entities including bodies are rigid designators.
there is a fuzzy boundary where the designators fall apart; at this point
entities and bodies disappear.
all disappearances carry the weight of political economy and inquiry.
there is no first and last node. there are no first and last linkages.

Recent, half-hearted "apologies" from Bush Administration officials
about abuses in Iraq have really missed the main point -- that all
the suffering and death of the Iraq war and occupation did not need
to occur. So, on May 20, 2004, the New Jersey Coalition Against War
in Iraq, meeting together with the Coalition for Peace Action's
Committee for Political Action in Princeton, NJ, proposed a US
Citizens' Apology to the People of Iraq. The wording and Arabic
translation of this apology were first displayed on May 28 at the
State House in Trenton, along with the Iraq Wall of Remembrance.
http://www.iraqmemorialwall.org/

The Coalition for Peace Action is now making the Citizens' Apology
available as an on-line petition, so Americans everywhere can express
their regrets and outrage by signing it. We are in touch with
contacts in Iraq to have the petition and signatures presented to
appropriate Iraqi civilian leaders in the future. In the meantime, we
urge you to click the link below, to read and sign the petition
yourself, and then to forward the link as widely as you can.

Such sad news to come just as I've been listening so intently these last few
weeks to the Beat Suite & Futurities, in hopes (perhaps vain, at that) of
writing about them.  I had the sincere pleasure of seeing Lacy while I was a
student in Buffalo -- a tiny venue.  It felt like he was playing in
someone's living room.  So close I could've touched him, and touch me his
music surely did.  Always.

I don't check poetics e-mail as often as I used to, so I'm late
getting into the Lacy love fest, but I've got to note that there's
often a fuller noticing of the deaths of innovative and/or
interesting musicians on this list than on several of the
music-related lists I get.

I didn't love every Lacy performance I heard, but every time I heard
him, he was always focused, always working & that's not always the
way things work with performers.

In addition to the various recordings/compositions already mentioned,
let me note the Woe his anti-war suite, and the Way, a Taoist suite,
as well as the couple of solo discs of Monk tunes on Soul Note.

Mr. Lacy played a great show here in Portland a few years
back, 2 i think. It was a Creative Music Guild gig, and there was a
big turn-out, and several standing ovations and encores.
I must admit I had gone on the advice of a friend and was=20
pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure I felt as enthusiastic about
the music as everybody else there did. It was good of course,
but seemed no where near as vigorous, creative and outrageous
as Bob Brotzmann's Chicago Tentet which came through
and played to a very measly audience and much less adulation.
The Tentet played spontaneous compositions based on handwritten
flash-cards. amazing..

At any rate sorry to hear about Mr. Lacy's death of course..
Is Guillermo Gregorio still alive? I really appreciate his contribution...

The Chicago Tentet
Br=F6tzmann (tenor sax, clarinet), Gustafsson (tenor sax, flutophone),
Vandermark (tenor sax, clarinet, bass clarinet), Bishop (trombone),
Kondo (trumpet, electronics), Lomberg-Holm (cello, violin), Parker
(bass), Kessler (bass), Zerang (drums), Drake (drums, frame drum).

Steve Lacy obituary from New England Conservatory





At Irene Aebi's request, I'm passing on this announcement of Steve
Lacy's death today to friends and colleagues. Steve passed away a little
after 12:30 p.m. in Boston today, June 4.

For Immediate Release:
June 4, 2004

New England Conservatory Mourns Death of Jazz Great Steve Lacy

Soprano Saxophone Master Succumbs to Cancer at Age 69

        Steve Lacy, one of the greatest soprano saxophonists of all time

and a New England Conservatory faculty member since fall 2002, died
Friday at New England Baptist Hospital. The jazz master who once defined

his profession as "combination orator, singer, dancer, diplomat, poet,
dialectician, mathematician, athlete, entertainer, educator, student,
comedian, artist, seducer and general all around good fellow" was 69.
He leaves his wife and collaborator, the Swiss singer Irene Aebi.

Born Steven Morman Lackritz in New York City, Lacy was the first avant
garde jazz musician to make a specialty of the soprano saxophone-an
instrument that had become almost completely neglected during the Bop
era. Indeed, he is credited with single-handedly bringing the instrument

back from obscurity into modern music of all types.  He regularly
received awards from DownBeat Magazine as the premier soprano
saxophonist and in 1992 received a MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant.
In 2002, he was made a Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by
the French government.  A prolific recording artist, Lacy is represented

on many labels including Universal, Senators, RCA, Verve, Label Bleu,
Greats of Jazz, EMI, CBS/C! olumbia, and Denon.

Throughout his career, Lacy was widely admired for the beauty and purity

of his tone, for his incisive melodic sense, for keeping his music
uncompromising and fresh, and for his eagerness to play with a wide
variety of musicians while retaining long-term musical relationships.
For example, since 1998, he performed often with Panamanian pianist and
NEC faculty member Danilo Perez, but he also played regularly with Mal
Waldron, a pianist he had worked with since the fifties. He was esteemed

for his productivity, and for the consistently high quality of his art.
As a teacher, a role he took on in the last two years of his life, he
was revered for his intense focus and generosity.

During the latter part of his career, Lacy made his home in Paris for 33

years, but returned to the United States in 2002 to begin his first
teaching job at NEC.  He was prominently featured in the concerts
celebrating the centennial of NEC's Jordan Hall in October 2003, kicking

off the festivities in a Best of Jazz performance that featured other
Conservatory jazz greats like Ran Blake, George Russell, Bob Brookmeyer,

and alumnus Cecil Taylor.

Lacy got his start as a sideman in the early fifties playing in
Manhattan's Dixieland revival scene.  He also worked with some Duke
Ellington players including cornetist Rex Stewart who christened him
"Lacy." Although he initially doubled on clarinet and soprano sax, he
soon dropped the former instrument and found his distinctive voice with
the saxophone.  It was the NEC-trained Cecil Taylor who set Lacy on a
new course and introduced him to Thelonious Monk-who, along with Duke
Ellington, would remain the most important influence in his life.
"Playing with Cecil Taylor immediately put me into the offensive mode"
(of music-making), Lacy recalled in his book Findings: My Experience
with the Soprano Saxophone. "This ! was the avant-tout garde; we were an

attack quartet (sometimes quintet or trio), playing original,
dangerously threatening music that most people were offended by...."

Lacy recorded with Gil Evans in 1957 and continued to work with him
intermittently up through the 1980s. In 1958, he and pianist Waldron
recorded Reflections: Steve Lacy Plays the Music of Thelonious Monk,
which led to an invitation to join Monk's quintet for four months in
1960. After that immersion experience, he created a quartet with
trombonist Roswell Rudd that dedicated itself exclusively to Monk's
music. He was still playing Monk as recently as last winter when he
introduced a new quintet at Manhattan's Iridium. Monksieland, comprised
of trumpeter Dave Douglas, Rudd, and Lacy's longtime Paris rhythm
section, bassist Jean-Jacques Avenel and drummer John Betsch, played
Monk  with the freedom and contrapuntal inter! play of Dixieland jazz.

In 1965, Lacy began performing in Europe where he found particularly
appreciative audiences in Italy and France.  He met his wife in Rome in
1966 and by the late sixties, they had settled down in Paris.  During
the enormously fertile decades that followed, he created a quintet that
could expand or contract from a duo or trio on up to a big band.  He
began collaborations with dancers (Merce Cunningham in particular),
artists and actors. He also started working with poets like Brion Gysin,

composing musical settings of their poems.

Irene Aebi exerted a profound influence on Lacy's artistry. For the
woman he called "his muse," he wrote his first composition, The Way
(1967), based on the words of Chinese philosopher Lao-Tzu. He continued
to be inspired by his wife's voice and wrote works for her based on
poetry by Anna Akhmatova, Mary Frazee, Anne Waldman, and Judith Malina.
He wrote an opera, The Cry, with Bengali poet Taslima Nasreen.  And,
over a period of many years, he composed The Beat Suite, a jazz song
cycle based on poetry by Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Robert Creeley,
and other beat poets.  That work had its
official world premiere in 2003 and has been recorded on a Universal CD.

As recently as this spring, Lacy and his wife were performing his
settings of Robert Creeley poems and excerpts from the Beat Suite at MIT

and Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art.

        At NEC, 36 students, both graduate and undergraduate, worked
directly with Lacy and he affected many others through his active
participation in the musical community.  In his teaching, he was
concerned with helping students become complete artists.  For example,
he might say of a young player: "He's got imagination, but he needs to
develop his taste a lot more-opera and poetry and literature and dance.
He really needs to broaden his base."  At NEC, he felt students could
get that broadening. "That's what I like about this school," he said in
an interview last year.   "...One can cross the hall and it's not such
rigid departments really. Anybody could study improvisation or Indian
music or symphonic construction or whatever..."

        About Lacy, NEC President Daniel Steiner said: "He was an
extraordinary artist, the kind of person who appears only a few times in

each generation of musicians.  His presence at the Conservatory affected

not simply the jazz program but the overall musical life of NEC."

Remarks by Ran Blake, head of NEC's Contemporary Improvisation
department.
"With the exception of Sidney Bechet and John Coltrane, no other
musician has brought such a personal sound to the soprano saxophone and
few other musicians have tapped into the unexplored repertoire of
Thelonious Monk."

Remarks by Danilo Perez, NEC Faculty, Jazz Pianist, and Lacy
collaborator:
Steve Lacy showed us that being a jazz musician is the work of a
lifetime.
His compositions and improvisations are full of wisdom and life. He
taught us the power of words through his music. Hearing his soprano
playing was a life changing experience, because he approached his sound,

improvisation and technique as if he believed it was a test of man's
sincerity.
As a friend he was a very encouraging, caring and generous man with a
great sense of humor. As a teacher he was a great educator who inspired
all of us inside and outside the classroom, with the genius of his
musical phrasing and his brilliant re! marks.
        Last year while playing a duo concert in New York, he took me to

an exhibition of a great Chinese painter.  His detailed comments about
the paintings offered a great lesson in color subtlety and form. I found

myself contemplating his words of wisdom all afternoon. That night after

the very inspired concert we played he said;" Danilo we were painting
tonight. "
        He was very kind to me and to many people who knew him. As he
would say the music and the artist become one as we get older.
Steve, thanks for inspiring and sharing your gifts with the world.  Your

great musical legacy will live in our hearts and minds forever  .
God bless Steve and his dear Irene.


Remarks by Ken Schaphorst,
Chair, Jazz Studies and Improvisation
The NEC community is devastated by this great loss. I can't think of
another musician who has been involved in so many different chapters in
the history of jazz, from Dixieland to Free Jazz, and everything in
between. Steve has brought his unique combination of open-mindedness,
humor, intelligence, rigor and artistry to his teaching at NEC over the
last two years. And everyone who has come into contact with him has been

transformed by his wisdom and musicianship. We will miss him.

Release: June 4, 2004 New England Conservatory Mourns Death of Jazz Great Steve
Lacy Soprano Saxophone Master Succumbs to Cancer at Age 69         Steve Lacy,
one of the greatest soprano saxophonists of all timeand a New England
Conservatory faculty member since fall 2002, died Friday at New England Baptist
Hospital. The jazz master who once definedhis profession as "combination
orator, singer, dancer, diplomat, poet, dialectician, mathematician, athlete,
entertainer, educator, student, comedian, artist, seducer and general all
around good fellow" was 69. He leaves his wife and collaborator, the Swiss
singer Irene Aebi.  Born Steven Morman Lackritz in New York City, Lacy was the
first avant garde jazz musician to make a specialty of the soprano saxophone-an
instrument that had become almost completely neglected during the Bop era.
Indeed, he is credited with single-handedly bringing the instrumentback from
obscurity into modern music of all types.  He regularly received awards from
DownBeat Magazine as the premier soprano saxophonist and in 1992 received a
MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant. In 2002, he was made a Commandeur de
l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.  A prolific recording
artist, Lacy is representedon many labels including Universal, Senators, RCA,
Verve, Label Bleu, Greats of Jazz, EMI, CBS/C! olumbia, and Denon. Throughout
his career, Lacy was widely admired for the beauty and purityof his tone, for
his incisive melodic sense, for keeping his music uncompromising and fresh, and
for his eagerness to play with a wide variety of musicians while retaining
long-term musical relationships. For example, since 1998, he performed often
with Panamanian pianist and NEC faculty member Danilo Perez, but he also played
regularly with Mal Waldron, a pianist he had worked with since the fifties. He
was esteemedfor his productivity, and for the consistently high quality of his
art. As a teacher, a role he took on in the last two years of his life, he was
revered for his intense focus and generosity. During the latter part of his
career, Lacy made his home in Paris for 33years, but returned to the United
States in 2002 to begin his first teaching job at NEC.  He was prominently
featured in the concerts celebrating the centennial of NEC's Jordan Hall in
October 2003, kickingoff the festivities in a Best of Jazz performance that
featured other Conservatory jazz greats like Ran Blake, George Russell, Bob
Brookmeyer,and alumnus Cecil Taylor. Lacy got his start as a sideman in the
early fifties playing in Manhattan's Dixieland revival scene.  He also worked
with some Duke Ellington players including cornetist Rex Stewart who christened
him "Lacy." Although he initially doubled on clarinet and soprano sax, he soon
dropped the former instrument and found his distinctive voice with the
saxophone.  It was the NEC-trained Cecil Taylor who set Lacy on a new course
and introduced him to Thelonious Monk-who, along with Duke Ellington, would
remain the most important influence in his life. "Playing with Cecil Taylor
immediately put me into the offensive mode" (of music-making), Lacy recalled in
his book Findings: My Experience with the Soprano Saxophone. "This ! was the
avant-tout garde; we were anattack quartet (sometimes quintet or trio), playing
original, dangerously threatening music that most people were offended by...."
Lacy recorded with Gil Evans in 1957 and continued to work with him
intermittently up through the 1980s. In 1958, he and pianist Waldron recorded
Reflections: Steve Lacy Plays the Music of Thelonious Monk, which led to an
invitation to join Monk's quintet for four months in 1960. After that immersion
experience, he created a quartet with trombonist Roswell Rudd that dedicated
itself exclusively to Monk's music. He was still playing Monk as recently as
last winter when he introduced a new quintet at Manhattan's Iridium.
Monksieland, comprised of trumpeter Dave Douglas, Rudd, and Lacy's longtime
Paris rhythm section, bassist Jean-Jacques Avenel and drummer John Betsch,
played Monk  with the freedom and contrapuntal inter! play of Dixieland jazz.
In 1965, Lacy began performing in Europe where he found particularly
appreciative audiences in Italy and France.  He met his wife in Rome in 1966
and by the late sixties, they had settled down in Paris.  During the enormously
fertile decades that followed, he created a quintet that could expand or
contract from a duo or trio on up to a big band.  He began collaborations with
dancers (Merce Cunningham in particular), artists and actors. He also started
working with poets like Brion Gysin,composing musical settings of their poems
Irene Aebi exerted a profound influence on Lacy's artistry. For the woman he
called "his muse," he wrote his first composition, The Way (1967), based on the
words of Chinese philosopher Lao-Tzu. He continued to be inspired by his wife's
voice and wrote works for her based on poetry by Anna Akhmatova, Mary Frazee,
Anne Waldman, and Judith Malina. He wrote an opera, The Cry, with Bengali poet
Taslima Nasreen.  And, over a period of many years, he composed The Beat Suite,
a jazz song cycle based on poetry by Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Robert
Creeley,and other beat poets.  That work had its official world premiere in
2003 and has been recorded on a Universal CD.As recently as this spring, Lacy
and his wife were performing hissettings of Robert Creeley poems and excerpts
from the Beat Suite at MITand Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art.
At NEC, 36 students, both graduate and undergraduate, worked directly with Lacy
and he affected many others through his active participation in the musical
community.  In his teaching, he was concerned with helping students become
complete artists.  For example, he might say of a young player: "He's got
imagination, but he needs to develop his taste a lot more-opera and poetry and
literature and dance. He really needs to broaden his base."  At NEC, he felt
students could get that broadening. "That's what I like about this school," he
said in an interview last year.   "...One can cross the hall and it's not such
rigid departments really. Anybody could study improvisation or Indian music or
symphonic construction or whatever..."         About Lacy, NEC President Daniel
Steiner said: "He was an extraordinary artist, the kind of person who appears
only a few times ineach generation of musicians.  His presence at the
Conservatory affectednot simply the jazz program but the overall musical life
of NEC." Remarks by Ran Blake, head of NEC's Contemporary Improvisation
department. "With the exception of Sidney Bechet and John Coltrane, no other
musician has brought such a personal sound to the soprano saxophone and few
other musicians have tapped into the unexplored repertoire of Thelonious Monk."
Remarks by Danilo Perez, NEC Faculty, Jazz Pianist, and Lacy collaborator:
Steve Lacy showed us that being a jazz musician is the work of a lifetime. His
compositions and improvisations are full of wisdom and life. He taught us the
power of words through his music. Hearing his soprano playing was a life
changing experience, because he approached his sound,improvisation and
technique as if he believed it was a test of man's sincerity. As a friend he
was a very encouraging, caring and generous man with a great sense of humor. As
a teacher he was a great educator who inspired all of us inside and outside the
classroom, with the genius of his musical phrasing and his brilliant re! marks.
        Last year while playing a duo concert in New York, he took me toan
exhibition of a great Chinese painter.  His detailed comments about the
paintings offered a great lesson in color subtlety and form. I foundmyself
contemplating his words of wisdom all afternoon. That night afterthe very
inspired concert we played he said;" Danilo we were painting tonight. "
He was very kind to me and to many people who knew him. As he would say the
music and the artist become one as we get older. Steve, thanks for inspiring
and sharing your gifts with the world.  Yourgreat musical legacy will live in
our hearts and minds forever  . God bless Steve and his dear Irene.  Remarks by
Ken Schaphorst, Chair, Jazz Studies and Improvisation The NEC community is
devastated by this great loss. I can't think of another musician who has been
involved in so many different chapters in the history of jazz, from Dixieland
to Free Jazz, and everything in between. Steve has brought his unique
combination of open-mindedness, humor, intelligence, rigor and artistry to his
teaching at NEC over the last two years. And everyone who has come into contact
with him has beentransformed by his wisdom and musicianship. We will miss him.

Washington Post reporting on Bush in France"

"...And Bush appeared angry when a French journalist asked why Bush was
"pushing your country and France to divorce?" The questioner cited a
quotation, "Every man has two countries, his own, and France," which he
attributed to John F. Kennedy. (It was, in fact, coined by Thomas
Jefferson.)

Bush shot back: "To paraphrase President Kennedy, there's America, and
there's Texas." He did not elaborate."

Anybody out there want to elaborate? I know certain things happened to
Kennedy down there in Texas - a divorce of a certain mortal sort, but, the
President would not be going that far with France, would he?? Or, maybe
there's something more profoundly true going on here.

"... presentation of a protagonist whose powerful wish to achieve some
goal seems inevitably to come up against  limits against which he or she
is powerless. The limits may be self-created, or imposed from without (by
people or some impersonal force), or they may even represent an inability
to establish any precise sense of what may be at issue .... The result is
an impasse for the protagonist -- defeat, humiliation, often death.
Whatever particular interpretation we may make of this, in general such
drama is itself the sign of the transitional moment after the collapse of
a stable order and the re-establishment of another."

Bush's Erratic Behavior Worries White House Aides
By DOUG THOMPSON
Publisher, Capitol Hill Blue
Jun 4, 2004, 06:15


President George W. Bush’s increasingly erratic behavior and wide mood
swings has the halls of the West Wing buzzing lately as aides privately
express growing concern over their leader’s state of mind.
In meetings with top aides and administration officials, the President
goes from quoting the Bible in one breath to obscene tantrums against the
media, Democrats and others that he classifies as “enemies of the state.”
Worried White House aides paint a portrait of a man on the edge,
increasingly wary of those who disagree with him and paranoid of a public
that no longer trusts his policies in Iraq or at home.
“It reminds me of the Nixon days,” says a longtime GOP political
consultant with contacts in the White House. “Everybody is an enemy;
everybody is out to get him. That’s the mood over there.”
In interviews with a number of White House staffers who were willing to
talk off the record, a picture of an administration under siege has
emerged, led by a man who declares his decisions to be “God’s will” and
then tells aides to “fuck over” anyone they consider to be an opponent of
the administration.
“We’re at war, there’s no doubt about it. What I don’t know anymore is
just who the enemy might be,” says one troubled White House aide. “We
seem to spend more time trying to destroy John Kerry than al Qaeda and
our enemies list just keeps growing and growing.”
Aides say the President gets “hung up on minor details,” micromanaging to
the extreme while ignoring the bigger picture. He will spend hours
personally reviewing and approving every attack ad against his Democratic
opponent and then kiss off a meeting on economic issues.
“This is what is killing us on Iraq,” one aide says. “We lost focus. The
President got hung up on the weapons of mass destruction and an unproven
link to al Qaeda. We could have found other justifiable reasons for the
war but the President insisted the focus stay on those two, tenuous
items.”
Aides who raise questions quickly find themselves shut out of access to
the President or other top advisors. Among top officials, Bush’s inner
circle is shrinking. Secretary of State Colin Powell has fallen out of
favor because of his growing doubts about the administration’s war
against Iraq.
The President's abrupt dismissal of CIA Directory George Tenet Wednesday
night is, aides say, an example of how he works.
"Tenet wanted to quit last year but the President got his back up and
wouldn't hear of it," says an aide. "That would have been the opportune
time to make a change, not in the middle of an election campaign but when
the director challenged the President during the meeting Wednesday, the
President cut him off by saying 'that's it George. I cannot abide
disloyalty. I want your resignation and I want it now."
Tenet was allowed to resign "voluntarily" and Bush informed his shocked
staff of the decision Thursday morning. One aide says the President
actually described the decision as "God's will."
God may also be the reason Attorney General John Ashcroft, the
administration’s lightning rod because of his questionable actions that
critics argue threatens freedoms granted by the Constitution, remains
part of the power elite. West Wing staffers call Bush and Ashcroft “the
Blues Brothers” because “they’re on a mission from God.”
“The Attorney General is tight with the President because of religion,”
says one aide. “They both believe any action is justifiable in the name
of God.”
But the President who says he rules at the behest of God can also
tongue-lash those he perceives as disloyal, calling them “fucking
assholes” in front of other staff, berating one cabinet official in front
of others and labeling anyone who disagrees with him “unpatriotic” or
“anti-American.”
“The mood here is that we’re under siege, there’s no doubt about it,”
says one troubled aide who admits he is looking for work elsewhere. “In
this administration, you don’t have to wear a turban or speak Farsi to be
an enemy of the United States. All you have to do is disagree with the
President.”
The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the record.

The loud whisperers of the west

<mailto:montfu65@hotmail.com>

    kkkanada doesn't record its nastiness. kkkanada never really shot
    down the natives when they (the robber barons) got here they just
    cleansed them with diseases and destroyed their self esteem then
    erase their culture via mind control and manipulation and hypocrisy
    (...and kkkanadians did it and do it with a pleasant blank
    expression on their face).


_______

A small example of a larger problem -- What I find disturbing is the
underhanded B.U.T. rather western way of attempting to manipulate the
post (of Victoria IMC) and situation from hidden avenues (which has
increased as of late) -- altering posts, hunting and pecking out reasons
to portray people in the usual negative profile of paranoia and fear
projection which makes Victoria work -- attempting to set one faction
against the other -- jews and muslims, anarchist and nonwhites - but
standing with the controls/strings in hand ready to manipulate
situations with grand standing commentary, fake outrage, false political
leanings, please for community and political correct fascist censorship
tactics of the early 90's meanwhile playing a moral high ground. it is a
place where nonwhites lives are devalued and where those very lives can
be taken at an instant and then forgotten even by those who claim to be
against the ethnic cleansing (PEACE TO ANTHANY DAWSON 09/21/69 -
08/13/99 AND ALL THE OTHER M.I.A.s) that kkkanada is founded on and so
many kkkanadian profit from, will pose and prance and whisper but never
do anything which will threaten their privilege in this cowardly new
world stolen for the robbers barons of the planet. kkkanada is a place,
which is deaf to evil, blind to evil and whispers evil daily -- even in
nightmares called dreams. This is the backbone of kkkanadian "white lies"

kkkanada doesn't record its nastiness. kkkanada never really shot down
the natives when they (the robber barons) got here they just cleansed
them with diseases and destroyed their self esteem then erase their
culture via mind control and manipulation and hypocrisy (...and
kkkanadians did it and do it with a pleasant blank expression on their
face). kkkanada simply hides it's cruelty (as it does the aryan
predators of the world) and thrives on mass distraction (i.e. look over
there at the US...) just the way the US uses the fear of the week to
manipulate their peoples. kkkanada will holler at full volume claiming
moral outrage over the atrocities of their allies B.U.T. does nothing to
correct it B.U.T. still collect the booty from the holocaust. kkkanada
uses weapons of mass distraction to set one people against the other in
order to keep the attention of the puppet masters.

kkkanada claims to dislike fascist and racism B.U.T. they house nazi and
south African ethnic cleansers and western thieves. they claim to
DISlike the US B.U.T. they train the US special forces with the use
kkkanadian aryan nation paratroopers. kkkanada also exports the most
white power, holocaust-denying propaganda in all of north amerikkka.

it is within the kkkanadian psyche and landscape to whisper and backbite
-- to attack from afar and divide and conquer meanwhile playing the
supportive liberal moderate when actually they are less a democracy and
far from kind and socialist B.U.T. in truth are frighteningly a
"benevolent dictatorship" out to CONtrol a people, who are products,
into serving the SYStem to no avail B.U.T. to keep the System working
for itself -- robber barons and the serfs.

kkkanada is a place, which allowed McGill University to house
US/Kkkanadian torture experiments from "no touch torture" to developing
mind controlling drugs to use against political radicals. kkkanada
supplies the US's destabilizing agenda with mercenaries/"security
specialist".

kkkanada is truly the great white north to its bloody brother/sister the
southern side of terror. It is the vacation zone for the sinister snakes
of the european market.

IMC is no different than the rest of the watered down elements of
kkkanadian DIStraction tactics.

by no means necessary shall there be any revolutionary thought, voice or
unity. kkkanada distances one peoples from another by centering their
attention on each other and the evils of other places outside the great
landscape of barren =ness and fear which is this country. its
outreaching hands, its controllers of the left wing are B.U.T. the
shills for the greed machinery of the country.

Kkkanada is like a Hollywood set of a western or universal playground
tour on valium. It is a place of diluted causes and cultures stolen from
around the world. It is a place where cultural imperialism comes to
white wash the cultures of those places destroyed by the meddling hands
of the western world. It is place of political impotence and frigid
revolutionaries. It a place of lies, frustrations and deception and
hypocrisy where it's mortal enemy is truly diversity and individualism.

this is what is the most detestable, sad and hateful aspect of kkkanada
-- that it teaches it's inhabitants to manipulate like envious teenager
in a crowded cafeteria or the bullying hall monitor with a likkle power
for the day, rather than confront and debate and deal the situation and
thus change. To not allow voices to flourish B.U.T. to know that that is
their right not the a privilage in need of
control by the overseers of puritanism.

Kkkanada is about CONtrol and the game of it. it is a DYSfunctional
marriage founded on inhumanity, manipulation and not love. It is 'bill
vanderzalm' pulling the wings off a fly and smirking.

... it's dwellers learn to abuse or be abused or be dealt with in a
slow, silent sadist manner where the truth of the horrors and kkkanadian
experience will never be told, because the whisperers never really
whisper, they speak in a theatrical staccato - the loud whisperers of
the west.

I'll be in Seattle this Friday-Tuesday, June 11-15, mainly to visit my son.
I'd appreciate hearing of any poetry events there on those days. Also, if
anyone has an email for Jeanne Heuving, please pass it on. I had it at one point,
but not now. Please backchannel.

Thanks,

proof-reading (I've known few visual poems that need "proof-reading"),

Pentagon Report Set Framework For Use of Torture

Security or Legal Factors
Could Trump Restrictions,
Memo to Rumsfeld Argued
By JESS BRAVIN
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
June 7, 2004; Page A1

Bush administration lawyers contended last year that the president
wasn't bound by laws prohibiting torture and that government agents who
might torture prisoners at his direction couldn't be prosecuted by the
Justice Department.

The advice was part of a classified report on interrogation methods
prepared for Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld after commanders at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, complained in late 2002 that with conventional
methods they weren't getting enough information from prisoners.

The report outlined U.S. laws and international treaties forbidding
torture, and why those restrictions might be overcome by
national-security considerations or legal technicalities. In a March 6,
2003, draft of the report reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, passages
were deleted as was an attachment listing specific interrogation
techniques and whether Mr. Rumsfeld himself or other officials must
grant permission before they could be used. The complete draft document
was classified "secret" by Mr. Rumsfeld and scheduled for
declassification in 2013.

The draft report, which exceeds 100 pages, deals with a range of legal
issues related to interrogations, offering definitions of the degree of
pain or psychological manipulation that could be considered lawful. But
at its core is an exceptional argument that because nothing is more
important than "obtaining intelligence vital to the protection of untold
thousands of American citizens," normal strictures on torture might not
apply.

The president, despite domestic and international laws constraining the
use of torture, has the authority as commander in chief to approve
almost any physical or psychological actions during interrogation, up to
and including torture, the report argued. Civilian or military personnel
accused of torture or other war crimes have several potential defenses,
including the "necessity" of using such methods to extract information
to head off an attack, or "superior orders," sometimes known as the
Nuremberg defense: namely that the accused was acting pursuant to an
order and, as the Nuremberg tribunal put it, no "moral choice was in
fact possible."

According to Bush administration officials, the report was compiled by a
working group appointed by the Defense Department's general counsel,
William J. Haynes II. Air Force General Counsel Mary Walker headed the
group, which comprised top civilian and uniformed lawyers from each
military branch and consulted with the Justice Department, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, the Defense Intelligence Agency and other intelligence
agencies. It isn't known if President Bush has ever seen the report.

A Pentagon official said some military lawyers involved objected to some
of the proposed interrogation methods as "different than what our people
had been trained to do under the Geneva Conventions," but those lawyers
ultimately signed on to the final report in April 2003, shortly after
the war in Iraq began. The Journal hasn't seen the full final report,
but people familiar with it say there were few substantial changes in
legal analysis between the draft and final versions.

A military lawyer who helped prepare the report said that political
appointees heading the working group sought to assign to the president
virtually unlimited authority on matters of torture -- to assert
"presidential power at its absolute apex," the lawyer said. Although
career military lawyers were uncomfortable with that conclusion, the
military lawyer said they focused their efforts on reining in the more
extreme interrogation methods, rather than challenging the
constitutional powers that administration lawyers were saying President
Bush could claim.

The Pentagon disclosed last month that the working group had been
assembled to review interrogation policies after intelligence officials
in Guantanamo reported frustration in extracting information from
prisoners. At a news conference last week, Gen. James T. Hill, who
oversees the offshore prison at Guantanamo as head of the U.S. Southern
Command, said the working group sought to identify "what is legal and
consistent with not only Geneva [but] ... what is right for our
soldiers." He said Guantanamo is "a professional, humane detention and
interrogation operation ... bounded by law and guided by the American
spirit."

Gen. Hill said Mr. Rumsfeld gave him the final set of approved
interrogation techniques on April 16, 2003. Four of the methods require
the defense secretary's approval, he said, and those methods had been
used on two prisoners. He said interrogators had stopped short of using
all the methods lawyers had approved. It remains unclear what actions
U.S. officials took as a result of the legal advice.

Critics who have seen the draft report said it undercuts the
administration's claims that it recognized a duty to treat prisoners
humanely. The "claim that the president's commander-in-chief power
includes the authority to use torture should be unheard of in this day
and age," said Michael Ratner, president of the Center for
Constitutional Rights, a New York advocacy group that has filed lawsuits
against U.S. detention policies. "Can one imagine the reaction if those
on trial for atrocities in the former Yugoslavia had tried this
defense?"

Following scattered reports last year of harsh interrogation techniques
used by the U.S. overseas, Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, wrote
to National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice asking for clarification.
The response came in June 2003 from Mr. Haynes, who wrote that the U.S.
was obliged to conduct interrogations "consistent with" the 1994
international Convention Against Torture and the federal Torture Statute
enacted to implement the convention outside the U.S.

The U.S. "does not permit, tolerate or condone any such torture by its
employees under any circumstances," Mr. Haynes wrote. The U.S. also
followed its legal duty, required by the torture convention, "to prevent
other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which
do not amount to torture," he wrote.

The U.S. position is that domestic criminal laws and the Constitution's
prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments already met the Convention
Against Torture's requirements within U.S. territory.

The Convention Against Torture was proposed in 1984 by the United
Nations General Assembly and was ratified by the U.S. in 1994. It states
that "no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or
a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public
emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture," and that
orders from superiors "may not be invoked as a justification of
torture."

That prohibition was reaffirmed after the Sept. 11 attacks by the U.N.
panel that oversees the treaty, the Committee Against Torture, and the
March 2003 report acknowledged that "other nations and international
bodies may take a more restrictive view" of permissible interrogation
methods than did the Bush administration.

The report then offers a series of legal justifications for limiting or
disregarding antitorture laws and proposed legal defenses that
government officials could use if they were accused of torture.

A military official who helped prepare the report said it came after
frustrated Guantanamo interrogators had begun trying unorthodox methods
on recalcitrant prisoners. "We'd been at this for a year-plus and got
nothing out of them" so officials concluded "we need to have a
less-cramped view of what torture is and is not."

The official said, "People were trying like hell how to ratchet up the
pressure," and used techniques that ranged from drawing on prisoners'
bodies and placing women's underwear on prisoners heads -- a practice
that later reappeared in the Abu Ghraib prison -- to telling subjects,
"I'm on the line with somebody in Yemen and he's in a room with your
family and a grenade that's going to pop unless you talk."

Senior officers at Guantanamo requested a "rethinking of the whole
approach to defending your country when you have an enemy that does not
follow the rules," the official said. Rather than license torture, this
official said that the report helped rein in more "assertive"
approaches.

Methods now used at Guantanamo include limiting prisoners' food, denying
them clothing, subjecting them to body-cavity searches, depriving them
of sleep for as much as 96 hours and shackling them in so-called stress
positions, a military-intelligence official said. Although the
interrogators consider the methods to be humiliating and unpleasant,
they don't view them as torture, the official said.

The working-group report elaborated the Bush administration's view that
the president has virtually unlimited power to wage war as he sees fit,
and neither Congress, the courts nor international law can interfere. It
concluded that neither the president nor anyone following his
instructions was bound by the federal Torture Statute, which makes it a
crime for Americans working for the government overseas to commit or
attempt torture, defined as any act intended to "inflict severe physical
or mental pain or suffering." Punishment is up to 20 years imprisonment,
or a death sentence or life imprisonment if the victim dies.

"In order to respect the president's inherent constitutional authority
to manage a military campaign ... (the prohibition against torture) must
be construed as inapplicable to interrogations undertaken pursuant to
his commander-in chief authority," the report asserted. (The
parenthetical comment is in the original document.) The Justice
Department "concluded that it could not bring a criminal prosecution
against a defendant who had acted pursuant to an exercise of the
president's constitutional power," the report said. Citing confidential
Justice Department opinions drafted after Sept. 11, 2001, the report
advised that the executive branch of the government had "sweeping"
powers to act as it sees fit because "national security decisions
require the unity in purpose and energy in action that characterize the
presidency rather than Congress."

The lawyers concluded that the Torture Statute applied to Afghanistan
but not Guantanamo, because the latter lies within the "special maritime
and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, and accordingly is
within the United States" when applying a law that regulates only
government conduct abroad.

Administration lawyers also concluded that the Alien Tort Claims Act, a
1789 statute that allows noncitizens to sue in U.S. courts for
violations of international law, couldn't be invoked against the U.S.
government unless it consents, and that the 1992 Torture Victims
Protection Act allowed suits only against foreign officials for torture
or "extrajudicial killing" and "does not apply to the conduct of U.S.
agents acting under the color of law."

The Bush administration has argued before the Supreme Court that
foreigners held at Guantanamo have no constitutional rights and can't
challenge their detention in court. The Supreme Court is expected to
rule on that question by month's end.

For Afghanistan and other foreign locations where the Torture Statute
applies, the March 2003 report offers a narrow definition of torture and
then lays out defenses that government officials could use should they
be charged with committing torture, such as mistakenly relying in good
faith on the advice of lawyers or experts that their actions were
permissible. "Good faith may be a complete defense" to a torture charge,
the report advised.

"The infliction of pain or suffering per se, whether it is physical or
mental, is insufficient to amount to torture," the report advises. Such
suffering must be "severe," the lawyers advise, and they rely on a
dictionary definition to suggest it "must be of such a high level of
intensity that the pain is difficult for the subject to endure."

The law says torture can be caused by administering or threatening to
administer "mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to
disrupt profoundly the sense of personality." The Bush lawyers advised,
though, that it "does not preclude any and all use of drugs" and
"disruption of the senses or personality alone is insufficient" to be
illegal. For involuntarily administered drugs or other psychological
methods, the "acts must penetrate to the core of an individual's ability
to perceive the world around him," the lawyers found.

Gen. Hill said last week that the military didn't use injections or
chemicals on prisoners.

After defining torture and other prohibited acts, the memo presents
"legal doctrines ... that could render specific conduct, otherwise
criminal, not unlawful." Foremost, the lawyers rely on the
"commander-in-chief authority," concluding that "without a clear
statement otherwise, criminal statutes are not read as infringing on the
president's ultimate authority" to wage war. Moreover, "any effort by
Congress to regulate the interrogation of unlawful combatants would
violate the Constitution's sole vesting of the commander-in-chief
authority in the president," the lawyers advised.

Likewise, the lawyers found that "constitutional principles" make it
impossible to "punish officials for aiding the president in exercising
his exclusive constitutional authorities" and neither Congress nor the
courts could "require or implement the prosecution of such an
individual."

To protect subordinates should they be charged with torture, the memo
advised that Mr. Bush issue a "presidential directive or other writing"
that could serve as evidence, since authority to set aside the laws is
"inherent in the president."

The report advised that government officials could argue that
"necessity" justified the use of torture. "Sometimes the greater good
for society will be accomplished by violating the literal language of
the criminal law," the lawyers wrote, citing a standard legal text,
"Substantive Criminal Law" by Wayne LaFave and Austin W. Scott. "In
particular, the necessity defense can justify the intentional killing of
one person ... so long as the harm avoided is greater."

In addition, the report advised that torture or homicide could be
justified as "self-defense," should an official "honestly believe" it
was necessary to head off an imminent attack on the U.S. The
self-defense doctrine generally has been asserted by individuals fending
off assaults, and in 1890, the Supreme Court upheld a U.S. deputy
marshal's right to shoot an assailant of Supreme Court Justice Stephen
Field as involving both self-defense and defense of the nation. Citing
Justice Department opinions, the report concluded that "if a government
defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a
manner that might arguably violate criminal prohibition," he could be
justified "in doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United
States by the al Qaeda terrorist network."

Mr. LaFave, a law professor at the University of Illinois, said he was
unaware that the Pentagon used his textbook in preparing its legal
analysis. He agreed, however, that in some cases necessity could be a
defense to torture charges. "Here's a guy who knows with certainty where
there's a bomb that will blow New York City to smithereens. Should we
torture him? Seems to me that's an easy one," Mr. LaFave said. But he
said necessity couldn't be a blanket justification for torturing
prisoners because of a general fear that "the nation is in danger."

For members of the military, the report suggested that officials could
escape torture convictions by arguing that they were following superior
orders, since such orders "may be inferred to be lawful" and are
"disobeyed at the peril of the subordinate." Examining the "superior
orders" defense at the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals, the
Vietnam War prosecution of U.S. Army Lt. William Calley for the My Lai
massacre and the current U.N. war-crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the
former Yugoslavia, the report concluded it could be asserted by "U.S.
armed forces personnel engaged in exceptional interrogations except
where the conduct goes so far as to be patently unlawful."

The report seemed "designed to find the legal loopholes that will permit
the use of torture against detainees," said Mary Ellen O'Connell, an
international-law professor at the Ohio State University who has seen
the report. "CIA operatives will think they are covered because they are
not going to face liability."

i don't usually forward these kinds of things so widely, but it
caught my interest and validated my suspicions...i wonder if we
circulate this widely enough if it could affect the election...

>Bush's Erratic Behavior Worries White House Aides
>
>By Doug Thompson, Publisher, Capitol Hill Blue, Friday, June 4, 2004
>
>President George W. Bush's increasingly erratic behavior and wide mood
>swings has the halls of the West Wing buzzing lately as aides privately
>express growing concern over their leader's state of mind.
>
>In meetings with top aides and administration officials, the President goes
>from quoting the Bible in one breath to obscene tantrums against the media,
>Democrats and others that he classifies as "enemies of the state."
>
>Worried White House aides paint a portrait of a man on the edge,
>increasingly wary of those who disagree with him and paranoid of a public
>that no longer trusts his policies in Iraq or at home.
>
>"It reminds me of the Nixon days," says a longtime GOP political consultant
>with contacts in the White House. "Everybody is an enemy; everybody is out
>to get him. That's the mood over there."
>
>In interviews with a number of White House staffers who were willing to talk
>off the record, a picture of an administration under siege has emerged, led
>by a man who declares his decisions to be "God's will" and then tells aides
>to "fuck over" anyone they consider to be an opponent of the administration.
>
>"We're at war, there's no doubt about it. What I don't know anymore is just
>who the enemy might be," says one troubled White House aide. "We seem to
>spend more time trying to destroy John Kerry than al Qaeda and our enemies
>list just keeps growing and growing."
>
>Aides say the President gets "hung up on minor details," micromanaging to
>the extreme while ignoring the bigger picture. He will spend hours
>personally reviewing and approving every attack ad against his Democratic
>opponent and then kiss off a meeting on economic issues.
>
>"This is what is killing us on Iraq," one aide says. "We lost focus. The
>President got hung up on the weapons of mass destruction and an unproven
>link to al Qaeda. We could have found other justifiable reasons for the war
>but the President insisted the focus stay on those two, tenuous items."
>
>Aides who raise questions quickly find themselves shut out of access to the
>President or other top advisors. Among top officials, Bush's inner circle is
>shrinking. Secretary of State Colin Powell has fallen out of favor because
>of his growing doubts about the administration's war against Iraq.
>
>The President's abrupt dismissal of CIA Directory George Tenet Wednesday
>night is, aides say, an example of how he works.
>
>"Tenet wanted to quit last year but the President got his back up and
>wouldn't hear of it," says an aide. "That would have been the opportune time
>to make a change, not in the middle of an election campaign but when the
>director challenged the President during the meeting Wednesday, the
>President cut him off by saying 'that's it George. I cannot abide
>disloyalty. I want your resignation and I want it now."
>
>Tenet was allowed to resign "voluntarily" and Bush informed his shocked
>staff of the decision Thursday morning. One aide says the President actually
>described the decision as "God's will."
>
>God may also be the reason Attorney General John Ashcroft, the
>administration's lightning rod because of his questionable actions that
>critics argue threatens freedoms granted by the Constitution, remains part
>of the power elite. West Wing staffers call Bush and Ashcroft "the Blues
>Brothers" because "they're on a mission from God."
>
>"The Attorney General is tight with the President because of religion," says
>one aide. "They both believe any action is justifiable in the name of God."
>
>But the President who says he rules at the behest of God can also
>tongue-lash those he perceives as disloyal, calling them "fucking assholes"
>in front of other staff, berating one cabinet official in front of others
>and labeling anyone who disagrees with him "unpatriotic" or "anti-American."
>
>"The mood here is that we're under siege, there's no doubt about it," says
>one troubled aide who admits he is looking for work elsewhere. "In this
>administration, you don't have to wear a turban or speak Farsi to be an
>enemy of the United States. All you have to do is disagree with the
>President."
>
>The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the record.

WORKSHOPS

WORKSHOP ON EXPERIMENTAL POETRY with Jorge Guitart
4 Saturdays July 10, 17, 24, and 31, 10 a.m -12 p.m. in The Hibiscus Room at
Just Buffalo
$100, $90 members, individual classes $30, $25 members

If you are tired of the trite and expected in the poetry of others or your
own, try your hand at playing with language in a serious, organized way. Let
randomness and unusual combinatory procedures get you started in creating
lines that no one could possibly have uttered or written before. Bring
poetry back to being a most unusual collocation of words. Let the poem write
you instead of the other way. Embark on the pleasures of intertextuality,
stealing from famous texts and subverting their intentions. You will be
introduced to techniques that will help you create hundreds if not thousands
of amazing poems in a relatively short time.

Jorge Guitart teaches in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures
at UB. He has been a member of JBLC Writers in Education since 1984 and has
led poetry workshops in Buffalo public schools. He  is the author of
Foreigner's Notebook (Shuffaloff 1993) and Film Blanc (Meow Press 1996). He
is represented at UB's Electronic Poetic Center.

SPOKEN ARTS RADIO
W/ Mary Van Vorst
6:35 a.m. and 8:35 a.m. Thursdays and 8:35 a.m. Sundays on WBFO 88.7 FM

July 8 & 11 Lee Stringer (Author of _Grand Central Winter_ and _Sleepaway
School_)

Lee Stringer will also be doing a book signing at Talking Leaves Books on
July 16.

Mime-Version: 1.0

Not as obviously connected to the world of innovative poetry (though
he did work with both Richard Hell & Patti Smith) as Steve Lacy,
Robert Quine was a wonderful musician who's been active in both punk
bands and improv projects.

And, for what it's worth, to put him into a context someone else
raised when the veritable onslaught of posts on Lacy's death
followed near silence on the earlier death of drummer Elvin Jones: I
probably heard Jones play live far more often than I did Quine, but
I'm pretty sure that I have more recordings of Quine in various
contexts than I do of Jones.

I'm sure there'll be some other obits eventually. Billboard (a trade
magazine for the record industry)'s reporting of non-business-related
news almost always is a little off, neglecting many of the artier
live projects that were never recorded. But hey.

Bests,

You could never miss Robert Quine's guitar with Richard Hell.
What is still in my head since I first saw his photo on the back of
Voidoid single was
that perminant expression on his face which was a notch above a poker
and begged mystery
and aggression, like his playing.  So basically, Quine scared me but you
hand keep listening. He added that edge to Hell's songs.

Cheers to Robert
May God bless yuh...

R.I.P.

Subject:      poet BERN PORTER dead at 93
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Bern Porter died yesterday morning at the age of 93
in his home in Belfast, Maine

his extraordinary life, from helping to build the atomic bomb, to leaving the project when he realized what he was doing, to spending every last penny he owned to help rebuild Nagasaki and Hiroshima...to never touching numbers again.  to turning the angle to poetry, for life.

when Sheila Holtz first moved to Maine to edit the bi-monthly Bern Porter International, an old friend of mine was upset about Sheila's decision.  he had no interest in reading Porter's poems or reading his magazine, "just THINK of all those lives destroyed because of his work!   fuck his poetry!"  but i disagreed then, and will always disagree with that argument.

at one point Sheila Holtz and i spoke of possibly interviewing Bern for PhillySound, but Bern was phobic and ignorant of technology, deliberately so after WWII

in fact he never quite understood that when i called his house in Maine to speak to Sheila, that i was paying for the call, and he'd yell, "THIS IS COSTING ME DAMMIT!"  and he'd hang up on me.  sometimes it took me more than a week to get ahold of Sheila.

this is not something i'm sharing in order to laugh at Bern.  i'm telling it because the man was a genius, but because of the greed and power in some men in this world, this genius was used in ways the man had never intended, and left him sick with its results, to shun his own intellect of numbers...

Spiders -- Before it's scrubbed clean, assuming that will happen, if you =
can go to Belfast and walk through Bern's yard, his outside gallery, you =
will find yet another astounding expression of his life and integration =
of SciArt and founds. I have about 30 non-digital photographs of objects =
taken there about 5 years ago, preparation for a documentary book that =
never was completed.=20

Bern was unique. I had the good fortune to visit him in Belfast a few =
times, sponsor him in Toledo and open my home to him. A complex artist =
and one who's story will be difficult to adequately capture in this =
wasteful, petty, acquisitive culture. He changed my life. Joel

Maybe now's the time to replay those Reagan speeches decrying human rights
abuses in the gulags of the Soviet Union (aka, "the Evil Empire.") - neatly
matched, of course, with the photos of our man Rumsfeld and the troops
fulfilling the Secretary of Defense's personal instructions and orders in
the prisons of Afghanistan, Quantanamo, and Iraq.

Maybe - as the current downward spiraling Administration tries to do
everything but climb into and hide under the cover of the casket -  an
honorable way to honor the Chief who this week lies in State?

Or, as a linguistic instrument to keep from getting totally twisted in all
of this!

Noam Chomsky on Reagan's Legacy
Bush Has Resurrected"The Most Extremist, Arrogant, Violent and Dangerous
Elements" of Reagan's White House

by Amy Goodman

DEMOCRACY NOW - The network and newspaper coverage of the death of Ronald
Reagan has brought forth a chorus of praise from Democrats and Republicans
alike. Much of the reporting and commentary, under the guise of respecting
the dead, has represented a dramatic rewriting of the history of the
Reagan years in office.

Looking back at the Reagan presidency doesn't mean we actually have to
look back. Many of the same people who populated his administration are in
the George W. Bush administration as well: James Baker, Elliot Abrams,
Paul Wolfowitz, Colin Powell, John Poindexter, John Negroponte, just to
name a few.

We asked leading dissident Noam Chomsky to reflect on the policies of
Reagan's administration during his 8 years in power and Reagan's influence
on the current Bush Administration.

Note: This is a rush transcript.

AMY GOODMAN: Noam Chomsky, can you talk about this, the people that are
now running the administration are some of the very people who ran the
Reagan administration more than 20 years ago?

NOAM CHOMSKY: That's quite true. The Reagan administration is either the
same people or their immediate mentors for the most part. I think one can
say that the current administration is a selection of the more extremist
and arrogant and violent and dangerous elements of the Reagan
administration. So on things like - I mean, that is true on domestic and
international policy they are, both in the Reagan years and now, they are
committed to dismantling the components of the government that serve the
general population -- social security, public schools and so on and so
forth, but in a more extreme fashion now. Partly because they think they
have achieved a sort of higher stage from which to launch the attack, and
internationally it's pretty obvious. In fact, many of the older Reaganites
and Bush, number one people have been concerned, even appalled by the
extremism of the current administration in the international domain.
That's why there was unprecedented elite criticism of the national
security strategy and the implementation in Iraq - narrow criticism, but
significant. So, yes, they're there, in fact, you cannot -- some of the
examples are remarkable, including the ones that you mentioned. And very
timely they picked Negroponte, who of course has just been appointed, the
new ambassador to Iraq where he will head the biggest diplomatic mission
in the world. The pretense is that we need this huge diplomatic mission to
transfer full sovereignty to Iraqis and that's so close to
self-contradiction that you have to admire commentators who sort of
pretend not to notice what it means, also to overlook, consciously, what
his role was in the Reagan administration. He also provided -- he was an
ambassador in the Reagan years, ambassador to Honduras where he presided
over the biggest C.I.A. station in the world, and the second largest
embassy in Latin America, not because Honduras was of any particular
significance to the U.S., but because he was responsible for supervising
the bases from which the U.S. mercenary army was attacking in Nicaragua,
and which ended up practically destroying it. By now, Nicaragua is lucky
to survive a few generations. That was one part of the massive
international terrorist campaign that the Reaganites carried out in the
1980's under the pretense they were fighting a war on terror. They
declared a war on terror in 1981 with pretty much the same rhetoric that
they used when they re-declared it in September 2001. It was a murderous
terrorist war. It devastated Central America, had horrendous effects
elsewhere in the world. In the case of Nicaragua, it was so extreme that
they were condemned by the World Court, by two supporting Security Council
Resolutions that the U.S. had to veto, after which, of course, they
rejected the court judgment and then escalated the war to the point where
finally the effects were extraordinary. By the analysis of their own
specialists, the per capita deaths in Nicaragua would be comparable to
about 2.5 million in the United States, which as they have pointed out is
greater than the total number of casualties in all U.S. wars, including
the Civil War and all wars in the 20th century, and what's left of the
society is a wreck. Since the U.S. took over again, it's gone even more
downhill. Now the second poorest in the hemisphere after Haiti and not
coincidentally, the second major target of U.S. intervention in the 20th
century after Haiti, which is first. The recent health administration
statistics show that about 60% of children under two are suffering from
severe anemia caused by malnutrition and probable brain damage. Costa
Rica, the United States is trying to - doing enough low-level work so that
they can send back some remittances to keep the families alive. It's a
real victory. You can understand why Colin Powell and others are so proud
of it. But Negroponte was charge of it in the first half the decade
directly, and in the second half more indirectly in the State Department
and National Security staff where he was Powell's adviser. And now he is
-- he is supposed to undertake the same role and similar role in Iraq. He
was called in Nicaragua "The Proconsul," and the "Wall Street Journal" was
honest enough to run an article in which they headlined "Modern Proconsul"
on which they mentioned his background in Nicaragua without going into it
much and said, yes he will be the proconsul of Iraq. Now, that's a direct
continuity, but there's a lot more than that. What you mentioned is
correct. Elliot Abrams is an extreme case. I mean, he's now the head of
the Middle East section of the National Security Council. He was -- as you
know, he was sentenced for lying to Congress. He got a presidential
pardon, but he was one of the most -- he was in charge in the State
Department of the Central American atrocities, and on the Middle East, he
is way out at the extreme end of the spectrum. This does reflect the -- in
a way the continuity of policies, but also the shift towards extremism
within that continuity.

AMY GOODMAN: There was a very little critical comment about President
Reagan this weekend on his death perhaps explained by his death, what
happens when a person dies, and what people say or perhaps also because
there is a kind of rewriting of history that has been going on. But one of
the few people who were quoted in the mainstream media was the Mexican
foreign minister, Jorge -- the former Mexican Jorge Castenada, whose
father served as foreign minister as well in 1979 to 1982 who said Reagan
was extremely unpopular in Mexico when he was president because of his
policies in Central America, and what was viewed in Mexico as a
Mexico-bashing campaign over drug trafficking. Reagan's involvement in
Nicaragua and El Salvador, viewed in Mexico, he said was unwarranted
meddling that was "interventionist, rooted in cold war rivalries and
disrespectful of international law." Castenada conditioned, "not only were
his policies viewed negatively, but he pressured Mexico enormously to
change its foreign policies."

NOAM CHOMSKY: That's correct. Casteneda is being diplomatic. He's
understating with regard to the international law and with regard to the
intervention. It was - it ended up with a couple hundred thousand people
being killed and four countries ruined. And even the world - the US - the
people now in office in Washington have the unique honor of being the only
ones in the world who have been condemned by the World Court for
international terrorism. That's a little more than what he said, but
that's what he's aiming at. The unpopularity continues. The latest figures
show that this George Bush, number two, latest Latin American figures,
among Latin American elites, the ones who tend to be more supportive of
the United States, I think it was about close to 90% opposition throughout
the hemisphere and approximately, if I remember, 98% opposition to him in
Mexico. But to be accurate, we should say that this goes way back. So,
John F. Kennedy was -- tried very hard to get Mexico to line up in his
anti-Cuba crusade. A famous comment by a Mexican foreign minister when
Kennedy tried to convince him that Cuba was to join in the terrorist war
against Cuba and the economic embargo strangulation, in fact on the
grounds that Cuba was a threat to the security of the hemisphere and the
Mexican ambassador said he had to decline, the prime minister had to
decline because if he tried to tell people in Mexico that Cuba was a
security threat, 40 million Mexicans would die laughing, which is
approximately the right answer. Here not so. The one point on which I
think Casteneda's comment that you quote is really misleading is when he
refers to cold war thinking and rivalries. There were no Russians in Latin
America. In fact, the U.S. was trying very hard to bring them in. Take,
say, Nicaragua, when the terrorist war against Nicaragua really took off,
Nicaragua tried to get some military aid to defend itself. And they went
first to European countries, France, others. The Reagan administration put
extreme pressure on them not to send military aid because they were
desperately eager for Nicaragua to get military aid from Russia or
indirectly through Cuba. So they could then present it as a cold war
issue. Nicaragua didn't fall into the trap as Guatemala had in 1954,
basically the same scenario. So, they didn't get jet planes from Russia to
defend their airspace against the U.S. attacks. They had every right to do
it, but the responsibility to do it, but they understood the consequences.
So, the Reagan administration had to float constant stories about how
Nicaragua was getting MIG jets from Russia in order to try to create a
cold war conflict. Actually it's very revealing to see the reaction here
to those stories. Of course, Nicaragua had every right to do it. The
C.I.A. had complete control over Nicaragua's airspace and was using it. It
was using it to send communications to the guerrilla army, which was --
guerrilla is a funny word for it, computers and helicopters and so on to
send them instructions so that they could follow the U.S. command orders
to avoid the Sandinista army, the Nicaraguan army and to attack what are
called soft targets, undefended civilian targets. It's a country that
doesn't have a right to defend its airspace to protect that, I don't know
what you can say. So obviously, they are a right to do it, but they
didn't. They allowed the U.S. to have control of the airspace and to
attack -- to use it to attack undefended targets.

AMY GOODMAN: Noam Chomsky, you have written about the U.S. as being only
country in the world to be convicted in the World Court of terrorism. And
this had to do with the bombing of the Nicaraguan harbor, which took place
under Reagan. Can you talk about that?

NOAM CHOMSKY: Yeah. That, too, is a little misleading. Nicaragua was
hoping to end the confrontation through legal means, through diplomatic
means.

AMY GOODMAN: I mean the mining of the harbor.

NOAM CHOMSKY: Yes, the mining of the harbors. They decided to -- they
asked a legal team headed by a very distinguished American international
lawyer, A. Chayes, professor of law at Harvard who had long government
service, and that legal team decided to construct an extremely narrow
case. So, they kept to matters that were totally uncontroversial, as the
U.S. conceded like the mining of the harbors, but it was only a toothpick
on a mountain. They picked the narrowest point in the hope that they could
get a judgment from the World Court, which would lead the United States to
back off from the whole international terrorist campaign, and they did win
a judgment from the court, which ordered the U.S. to terminate any
actions, any violent actions against Nicaragua, which went way beyond
mining of the harbors. That was the least of it. So, yes, that was the
narrow content of the court decision, although, if you read the decision,
the court decision that goes well beyond, they're all conscious of the
much wider terrorist campaign, but the Harvard - the Chayes run legal team
didn't bring it up for good reasons. Because they didn't want any
controversy at the court hearings about the facts. There was no
controversy about that, since it was conceded. However, it should be read
as a much broader indictment, and a very important one. I mean, the term
that was used by the court was "unlawful use of force," which is the
technical term for the informal notion, international terrorism. There's
no legal definition of international terrorism in the international
domain. So I bet it was in effect a condemnation of international
terrorism over a much broader domain. However, we should bare in mind,
it's important for us, that horrible as the Nicaragua war was, it wasn't
the worst. Guatemala and El Salvador were worse. I suggest that in
Nicaragua, the reason was that in Nicaragua, the population at least had
an army to defend it. In El Salvador and Guatemala, the terrorist forces
attacking the population were the army and the other security forces.
There was no one to bring a case to the World Court that can be brought by
governments, not by peasants being slaughtered.

...

AMY GOODMAN: Professor Chomsky, I wouldn't want to end this discussion
without talking about the Reagan years and Africa, particularly southern
Africa.

NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, the official policy was called "constructive
engagement." I recall it during the 1980s, by then there was enormous
pressure to end all support for the apartheid government. Congress passed
legislation barring trade and aid. The Reagan administration found ways to
evade the congressional legislation, and in fact trade with South Africa
increased in the latter part of the decade. This is incidentally the
period when Collin Powell moved to the position of national security
adviser.

The U.S. was strongly supporting the apartheid regime directly and then
indirectly through allies. Israel was helping get around the embargo.
Rather as in Central America where the clandestine terror made use of
other states that served as -- that helped the administration get around
congressional legislation. In the case of South Africa, just look at the
rough figures. In Angola and Mozambique, the neighboring countries, in
those countries alone, the South African depredations killed about
million-and-a-half people and led to some $60 billion in damage during the
period of constructive engagement with the u.s. support. It was a horror
story.

Frank Parker has added my "New Hampshire Sketches," all 49 brief parts of
it, to the crowd of good poems at his site http://www.frankshome.org/. It
was written in 1978 and has never seen print. It still reads pretty well, I
think.

this has to be worth something:

chapbook contest



Furniture Press announces it’s first annual chapbook competition, although sadly competition is such a cruel word these days (well, why not use convolution? it sounds like competition?) Right, our first annual chapbook CONVOLUTION, which consists of the following guidelines & deadlines.



2004 Prize


An edition of two hundred [200] copies of the chapbook will be pressed & twenty-five [25] copies will be given to the winner [extra copies can be purchased at a handsome discount].

Miscellany


20-40 pages. No pure ‘genre’ confinement necessary here. You send us your best work, whether it be textual, image-based, text-image hybrids, text art [you get the picture]. Please send one [poem/image/text-event] per page, unless form dictates alternatives, which we encourage.



Include a cover sheet with name, address, telephone, e-mail. Do not put your name on individual sheets [we like a bias free reading, viewing].



If you have published individual works elsewhere it is not an issue, although the full manuscript must not have been published previously as a group. Submit a full list of acknowledgements of previously published work.



You may send multiple submissions, but please mail them separately & with the appropriate cover sheet & SASE’s.

I've written to George Bush (why does he never answer?) to suggest that the
funeral rites for Reagan have been too modest, but it's not too late to
make amends. Why not have funeral games, as at the death of Patroclus?
Where are the threnodists? Most important, where are the human sacrifices?
The immolation of half the cabinet and the Supreme Court would be more than
impressive.

Now I'm concerned that I might have put an idea in their heads that they'll
surely screw up--substituting Guantanamo detainees for the cabinet, for
starters.

We should all be wearing black armbands, or garters, maybe.

To whom it may concern:

Ronald Reagan did not utter the word AIDS for 6 years. He served for 8.

He also dismantled state mental health institutions.
Today, if you are rich you can find a place for a loved one suffering from
mental illness. If you are poor, the institutions are gone. Try the boomerang
method, read: you get to stay in the state hospital as long as your insurance
provider allows then back out on the street.

Thank you for nothing. Cowboy.

PS: my favorite incident: reporter shouts to Reagan out on the ranch: "what
about the hostages ?" he stares blankly Nancy turns to him in a stage whisper
to Ronnie "We are doing the best we can" Ronald then answers the reporter "We
are doing the best we can." dummy ? president ? you decide ?

PPS: artistic respone:

the refrain of ACT UP was "silence equals death"
I have modified it in honor of the fallen:

"silent , dead"

this spectacle can't be over soon enough for me

Poems of Blood and Anger
By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF


If the world leaders at the G-8 summit meeting want to understand the=20
war in Iraq, they should look beyond the war plans and U.N.=20
resolutions. The most incisive analysis of war has often come from=20
poets, like Homer or Wilfred Owen.

And now the Iraq poems are beginning to come in, offering another way=20
to memorialize the struggle there. In April, I announced a contest for=20=

readers' poems about the Iraq war. Since then, I've been deluged by=20
more than 1,000 sonnets, limericks, haiku =97 and, alas, epics.

Many try to capture the ugliness on the ground with the beauty of=20
verse. Tim Johnson of Northville, Minn., wrote:

  Outside the city, shivering with dread,
  We're Falluja bound.
  Can hear the explosions when I raise my head. . . .
  Foreign soldiers, invaders from another land;
  When I look through the hatred in their eyes,
  I almost understand.
  R.P.G.'s, mortars, and friends dead on the road.
  My youth is gone,
  Crushed from sensory overload.
  Assaulted yesterday up an Iraqi street.
  R.P.G. explosion, a scream,
  Seared my face with the heat.
  Dragged him through the blood-streaked dust and dirt,
  His screams in my ears,
  His blood type tagged to his shirt.
  Covered with blood, he cried, Don't leave me alone.
  Died in my arms;
  Now I just want to go home.
  Officers yelling, Get out of your holes!
  We're Falluja bound;
  Please pray for our souls.

  An embittered second lieutenant who asks not to be named wrote:

  Knock the dust off your boots, my boy,
  It's time to ride again.
  The frontier has gone restless now
  And we must crush this rebellion. . . .
  These people understand only violence,
  So let's give it to 'em now.
  We'll ride 'em down like Cherokee;
  We'll trample 'em like Pueblo.
  These savages are ruthless;
  They understand no law.
  So we'll pick up our Peacemakers,
  And shoot 'em like Choctaw. . . .
  Rally round the flag, my boy,
  And grab your rifle, too.
  The Red Man's turned Brown, my boy,
  And there's a lot of peacemaking to do.

Megan Foley, a 16-year-old from Long Island, focused like many on the=20
ambiguities of a war that was supposed to enhance moral clarity:

  Confusion, fear and lies;
  What good can come when people die?
  Red Blood spilt
  On barren land
  To complete an alchemical plan,
  Red Blood to Black Gold,
  Deviously poisoning, polluting, choking our Heart.
  Men tortured, defiled, dishonored by their Brethren,
  Captured on film, a permanent bruise
  Not to be overlooked.
  Truth and honor wither away;
  They know they do not belong.
  Boundaries grow hazy
  Accompanied by roles:
  Who the victim? Who the villain? Both? Neither?
  For what purpose and to what end?
  Why fight a war
  Paid with lives
  Only to gain confusion, fear and lies?

Another young entrant, Zach Chotzen-Freund of Santa Barbara, Calif.,=20
examined in this excerpt the esprit that leads 17-year-olds to sign up=20=

for war. Fittingly, he's 17.

  Off now, children! Off to war! Kill in your country's name!
  For murder on behalf of kin is what allows our boys to win
  And rest someday in cherished lore. So off now, off to war!
  Off now, children! Off to war! Make your fathers swell with pride!
  For though you're young, they love to hear that you're a splendid=20
bombardier
  And dodge death like a matador.
  So off now, off to war!
  Off now, children! Off to war! Bring smiles to your mothers' eyes!
  They hate to lose you, sure that's true, but if flags of red, white=20
and blue
  Are at your funeral, souls will soar.
  So off now, off to war!

More readers' poems are posted at www.nytimes.com/kristofresponds, my=20
blog. I'll run the grand winners in my next column, on Saturday.

Lincoln suicide poem believed found

Tuesday, June 8, 2004 Posted: 8:12 PM EDT (0012 GMT)

SPRINGFIELD, Illinois (AP) -- A presidential historian has found a poem
about suicide that he believes might have been written by Abraham
Lincoln.

Richard Lawrence Miller, the author of "Truman: The Rise to Power,"
searched every issue of the weekly Sangamo Journal from 1831 to 1842 as
part of his research into Lincoln's life, and found an unsigned poem
that matched one described by friends of Lincoln.

Miller analyzed "The Suicide's Soliloquy," published in an 1838 issue,
and concluded that a 29-year-old Lincoln was the author. Miller wrote
about his find in the spring 2004 issue of the newsletter of the
Abraham Lincoln Association of Springfield.

Lincoln scholars have long known of a suicide poem but had never found
it. Some dated the poem to 1841, the year Lincoln suffered from
depression after breaking his engagement to Mary Todd. William Herndon,
Lincoln's law partner and biographer, once reported that the poem had
been published in the Sangamo Journal but was later clipped out of the
only copy he could find.

After discovering "The Suicide's Soliloquy," Miller analyzed it for
similarities in meter and style to other Lincoln poems.

Kim Bauer, the Lincoln curator for the Abraham Lincoln Presidential
Library and Museum, agreed that the possibility is strong Lincoln wrote
the poem.

"The basic sentence structure and the words that are used are certainly
well within the parameters that Lincoln wrote a lot of his poetry,"
Bauer said.

Tom Schwartz, the state historian, also believes Miller's theory is
plausible.

"We all know that Lincoln had his moods, was a depressive personality,"
Schwartz said. "And this lends credence to what ... both his
contemporaries and historians generally concede was part of his
personality makeup."

and why should it be!?

what error did you make in attacking that piece of shit former president?

he is dead, and i am smiling, and not going to apologize.

he has not been a threat for a long while, but it is good he can no longer
breathe our delicious air.

let his molecules be the only gift his life could offer in the end, his, now mixing with the
thousands and thousands of those dead of AIDS, not to mention the thousands
who were murdered in Central and South America during his term.

anger for those who will praise the man to sheild us from our own memories
of his tyranny!

Reagan in all his attempts to undermine queer and other deviant communities
created a FORCE by doing so, and ACT-UP, being formed, became an emblem
for those who went from being afraid of dying, to NOT being afraid of living!
indirectly, this union of POWER for really ACTUALLY living, is his gift.

but still, may we one day see his grave defiled.
may his grave one day have an outhouse built where his headstone was removed!

rub your eyes, get out of bed, ding dong, the wicked witch is dead!

dear nathaniel:
are you worried about bringing down the wrath of the current
ever-more-obviously-dictatorial regime on your head and ending up
hooded and naked with electrodes on your genitalia and dogs nipping
your flesh as an "enemy of the state"? i don't blame you, given what
we're learning about the sweeping political powers our "supreme"
commander has arrogated to himself combined with his ever-shakier
powers of rational cognition.  but we'll all be there with you.
courage, my friend; we're all going to need a lot of that in the
coming years. that, and a high pain threshold.

Thanks, Pierre Joris, for drawing attention to today's NY Kristof's column
where he published the poems by and from soldiers in Iraq. I believe it,
also, important to write Kristof (<nicholas@nytimes.com>) with an
appreciation for performing this. (One can almost hear Rumsfeld in the
background saying, "Who would have ever thought there were all these
soldiers running around writing poems and sending them to the NY Times"
(instead of his often quoted astonishment and rage at all these folks
running around in the prison with digital cameras, etc.)

For what it's worth, here is what I sent Kristof:

Thanks for the publishing these - to say the least - upsetting poems. The
words give more "texture" to the war experience of these soldiers than most
of what's come across from government "embedded" reporters.

Sadly I think this country will soon be host to a whole new generation of
mentally and physically wounded soldiers that will live on our city streets
and, indeed, will be called "homeless" in every sense of the word. Let alone
the fate of the Iraqis, however caught up in the middle of all of this.

I hate to say I look forward to more of these - but better a poem than
Bush's and Company's savagely wrong optimism on reasons for "staying the
course" in Iraq.

Another query, 2, from Lyn, Colin, Ruth, Jean, & Jen regarding Zukofsky's
Anew:

Re #34, "The Letter of Poor Birds."  What are the poor birds?  They seem
more specific than we are able to muster.
Also, was this the last poem of the cycle composed (1944), or is it #16
that's last?

Does anyone have a gloss for "Belly Locks Shnooks Oakie"--the first line of
#38?  Closest we've come is it's an amalgamation of the "John Jacob Jingle
Heimer Smith" kind.

thanks in advance for any stabs at this--js

And the chicken is deceased. Of course, that could then be
necro-bestiality.

YOu gotta respect a man who overstands Kylie. Her performance on the
Vicar fo Dibley with Dawn French was spectacular. Kylie has never made a
wrong step in your brilliant career which make us wonder what heights
Edie Sedgwick would have soared if she had less exploitation and more
punk sensiblity as Kylie has demonstrated throughout her career. Cheers
to the Princess of Pop and the fusion of NEo-Mod and Post Hip Hop
reality grooves.

big up Kevin

Tina Chang's poems perform the ancient tasks of remembrance, recovery, =
and praise. This work seeks to account for a life in the context of the =
myths, cultural and familial, that both nurture and threaten that very =
life and the voice that might sing it into legend. This is a poetry of =
amazing lushness, melancholy and affirmation.=20
                =97Li-Young Lee=20

Her mouth is fertile, seeded with incidents from a family history that =
lay scattered about like grains of rice upon which our poet kneels. =
Misfit and starlet, she wrestles with her father on earth and in Heaven. =
Whether seasoned with gunpowder or with sugar, Tina Chang's legacy is =
neither entirely Chinese nor American but an inheritance to be spoken =
through dialects=97a composite language forged out of her many lyrical =
selves.=20

        Instrumentality=20
        <http://www.cherry-grove.com/shankar.html>

Instrumentality plays expectations and delivers uncanny reformulations =
that seem "predestined, in retrospect." Ravi Shankar=92s poems are =
filled with the pleasure of subjects dissolving into ideas, ideas =
folding into sounds, and sounds echoing familiar but elusive =
translocations.=20
=97Charles Bernstein

This is a very special first book. Ravi Shankar's poems have a fine =
tuned sense of form, a rare delight in language. Through wit and =
abstraction they reveal a metaphysics of longing, binding us to the =
elements of our moving world.
                =97Meena Alexander

Quirky, quizzical, inquisitive, Ravi Shankar in Instrumentality goes in =
quest of what the oddness of language and imagination can reveal: =93a =

Sharma is inclined to explore cultural disjunctions, the glide of sound, =
power, and perception between people and languages: "you are pointing =
west when you say dish, desh." Sometimes she sounds as American as John =
Berryman. But at other times Sharma serializes simple declarative =
statements or taps into a kind of Berlitz translation diction: "We are =
an Indian family with Indian friends from India." In other words, her =
imagination is whirring at full tilt, and her approaches to the poem are =
varied and fresh and exciting.=20

While we're following a coffin whose voyage brings to mind some =
slow-motion
oddyssey, let's think about RR's claim to paternity of the current
administration. David Lytel came up with a top-ten list.

So, tops off.
Bush has learnt that:

10. Even if tax cuts build a weaker America they build a stronger =
Republican
party
9. A President must take full responsibility for everything except =
mistakes
and illegal activities.
8. While overt racism is unseemly, a Republican leader should signal to
white-power proponents that he agrees with them.
7. Nations that assist the United States in its foreign policy goals can
murder, torture, and imprison anyone necessary to maintain stability.
6. Bust unions whenever you can, because those people are a danger to =
the
continued concentration of wealth and power in the hands of trust-fund
Republicans.
5. The most effective way to please corporate contributors is to appoint
regulatory chiefs who will undermine their agencies from within.
4. If defense policies serve only to tie corporate interests more =
closely to
the Republican party without making the nation more secure, that=92s =
good
enough.
3. No global problem is too big to be ignored.
2. If you are affable, the commercial news media will judge you on your
intentions rather than your actual results.=20
1. Boldly claim credit for major historic events and make it seem that =
you
caused them.

WHERE: Niagara Square, Buffalo, New York, near the courthouse (see
"Driving Directions" below for map)

PLEASE CIRCULATE THIS CALL AS WIDELY AS YOU CAN.

SUPPORT FREE SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF KNOWLEDGE

Critical Art Ensemble (CAE) is a collective of internationally
recognized artists who work in public, educational, academic and art
contexts. For the past few years, their principal aim has been to help
the general public to understand biotechnology. By making scientific
research accessible to laypeople through participatory performance
experiences, CAE aims to demystify what is safe and clarify what is
dangerous about today's biotech industry.

CAE always undertake their work in a safe and considered way. The
materials they use are strictly non-hazardous, can be legally obtained
by anyone, and are commonly found in undergraduate-level biology labs.
For more on CAE's projects and the biological agents and equipment
they work with, please visit http://www.caedefensefund.org/.

A federal grand jury will convene on June 15 in Buffalo, New York, to
consider bioterrorism charges brought by the Joint Terrorism Task
Force against CAE member and University at Buffalo professor Steve
Kurtz. The grand jury is the latest installment in a bizarre
investigation in which members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force seem
to have mistaken CAE's latest art project for a biological weapons
laboratory.

According to the subpoenas served to at least seven artists, the
charges fall under Section 175 of the US Biological Weapons
Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which has been expanded by the USA PATRIOT
Act to prohibit the possession of "any biological agent, toxin, or
delivery system" without the justification of "prophylactic,
protective, bona fide research, or other peaceful purpose"
(http://caedefensefund.org/faq.html#law). Those served with subpoenas
include two founding members of CAE (Steven Barnes, Dorian Burr,
Beverly Schlee), two artists who have collaborated with CAE (Beatriz
da Costa, Paul Vanouse), and at least two other artists.

Many worry that the case could set a dangerous precedent by silencing
a group of artists for work that stimulates vital public discussion.
Many feel that with this case and others, the government is wildly
overreaching its mandate to protect the public from terrorism.

"Groups like CAE stimulate the public debate that is necessary to a
healthy democracy," said Claire Pentecost, an artist who has
collaborated with CAE in the past. "This isn't a case of one artist
fighting for the freedom to express him or herself with images or
speech that some of the public might find offensive. This is a case of
a group of artists using performance to educate the public on issues
that affect all of us in our daily lives. The government's actions
suggest a criminalization of a citizen's right to acquire knowledge by
completely legal means. This goes to the very heart of democracy."

A number of other recent cases suggest that that the PATRIOT Act and
other recent "security" measures have made freedom of speech
increasingly fragile in the U.S. A list of such cases will be
available shortly at http://www.caedefensefund.org/


ABOUT THE DEMONSTRATION: Please bring signs and banners if you can
(see http://caedefensefund.org/demonstration.html#signs). This is a
peaceful demonstration. As in all demonstrations, it's best to bring
personal identification (driver's license, passport, student id, proof
of address, etc.). Let someone know where you're going to be. Stick
with a buddy.

DRIVING DIRECTIONS: From Interstate 90 take 33W into downtown all the
way to the end. It will put you onto Oak St. Continue on Oak for 2
long blocks to Broadway. Go right on Broadway which runs right into
Court St. The first square is Lafayette and then comes Niagara Square.
There are paid parking lots all around this downtown area. Information
on possible housing will be on the website shortly.

Maria, in particular i liked you saying "courage my friend" in building
strength in numbers, since we are all in this together.

but i'll be perfectly honest, that i had read Siegel's original post,
"angry response to president's death " and liked it, and was filled
with that sense that we ARE all in this together.

but then, when the post
"urgent request: please do not post my message of last night"
popped up, frankly, i was not only irritated, but slightly disgusted.

it's the same way i feel when BLOGGERS out there make their
zealous stand, for whatever reason, then delete the post, with
some sort of disclaimer attached.

WHY can't we all be making room for all ideas, together?
so what if we don't all agree.  and furthermore, we DO need courage,
which means we DO need to be speaking OUT, and speaking UP.

if we all really DO believe that this is a time of great oppression,
speaking out and holding our ground is courage, and strength.

but HIDING what we feel is NOT courage.
let's not confuse courage for cowardice.

let Kevin Killian's rants posted recently by Dodie Bellamy
be an example of courage!  thank you Kevin!

we're learning about the sweeping political powers our "supreme"
commander has arrogated to himself combined with his ever-shakier
powers of rational cognition.  but we'll all be there with you.

Subject:      city upon a hill
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

In the morass of pious hypocricy with which we're all being bathed, at
least in the US, one speaker after another has quoted John Winthrop's great
sermon aboard the Arabella, flagship of the Puritan fleet, as it lay at
anchor in what would become Boston harbor. There's a long tradition behind
this, and behind the conflation of what Winthrop actually meant (it's right
there in the words) and the rhetoric of the New Jerusalem, so that the city
upon a hill has become the shining city upon the hill. Winthrop used the
phrase not as a hope but a warning--that there will be no place to hide. I
present the pertinent paragraph below. If we get past the god stuff what's
left doesn't read much like the commonwealth that Reagan or his heirs, all
of them first-class sons-of-bitches, had in mind--in fact, it sounds a lot
more like Eurosocialism. Winthrop, by the way, was one of the architects of
American genocide. But hell, he wrote well.

Now the only way to avoid this shipwreck, and to provide for our posterity,
is to follow the counsel of Micah, to do justly, to love mercy, to walk
humbly with our God. For this end, we must be knit together, in this work,
as one man. We must entertain each other in brotherly affection. We must be
willing to abridge ourselves of our superfluities, for the supply of
others' necessities. We must uphold a familiar commerce together in all
meekness, gentleness, patience and liberality. We must delight in each
other; make others' conditions our own; rejoice together, mourn together,
labor and suffer together, always having before our eyes our commission and
community in the work, as members of the same body. So shall we keep the
unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. The Lord will be our God, and
delight to dwell among us, as His own people, and will command a blessing
upon us in all our ways, so that we shall see much more of His wisdom,
power, goodness and truth, than formerly we have been acquainted with. We
shall find that the God of Israel is among us, when ten of us shall be able
to resist a thousand of our enemies; when He shall make us a praise and
glory that men shall say of succeeding plantations, "may the Lord make it
like that of New England." For we must consider that we shall be as a city
upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us. So that if we shall deal
falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause Him to
withdraw His present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word
through the world. We shall open the mouths of enemies to speak evil of the
ways of God, and all professors for God's sake. We shall shame the faces of
many of God's worthy servants, and cause their prayers to be turned into
curses upon us till we be consumed out of the good land whither we are going.

In a time of war & political woe & onset of summer, I find this excerpt
brings some peace, at least the immediate peace of reading:

From Philip Whalen's Journal, "Sierras 1957"

...Here, like the summer I worked on the Skagit, I am conscious of little
more than the absolute present. I feel free of the past and from myself.
There is the continuous roar of water & a slight breeze & I breathe & digest
food noisily, but "I" has temporarily stopped his usual noisy clamor,
feelings of imitation, frustration, ambition, remorse. The view of the
mountains, the immediate trees & water & at night the stars - all can be
looked at for any length of time & enjoyed as themselves. They require
nothing - & I feel I require nothing either. I've been taught they are
beautiful: they destroy "ME" & cut me loose to drift high as kite, "high on
mountains & poetry" like Snyder wrote in his last book.
    The question is, who's writing this now, having these feelings and
notions. Naturally, the same collection of habits & history that exists
wherever this person happens to be...

I was of course referring to the communitarian, economic egalitarian
content. I should have thought that that would be apparent. I'm perfectly
aware, and thought that I'd indicated as much, that the practice became in
short order very different.

For all I know you may be delusional. On the evidence I'd say that you
don't read very carefully.

one of the most chilling lyrics of its kind... ever...


There were seven Spanish angels, (at the altar).
at the altar of the sun, (oh I believe)
They were praying for the lovers (yeah they was),
In the Valley of the Gun,
(Well, well, well),
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared (there was thunder),
There was thunder from the throne, (oh yeah),
And seven Spanish angels,
Took another angel home.

Dodie Bellamy reads from Pink Steam

Pink steam rises from the vats of melting goo in the Vincent Price 3-D
horror classic, House of Wax. Railroad buffs know "pink steam" as the first
blast from a newly christened steam engine, which appears pink as it spews
out rust. And now Pink Steam, the book, reveals the intimate secrets of
Dodie Bellamy's life-sex, shoplifting, voyeurism, writing.


"Pink Steam is a compulsive read. This expert collection of essays qua
fictions walks a vertiginous border between individual experience and the
sadistic force of the accepted "norm." There is truth on one side, lying on
the other. Then they switch, the inanimate become the animate, the fiction
reality, and what seemed peaceful and clean suddenly becomes monstrous.
Barbie's Dream House turns gothic, Judy Garland sadly ponders Henry Darger,
a woman in Florida turns into a reptile, demons are exorcised via bulimia,
and so on. No weird world this, but rather the vanishing middlebrow America
of Montgomery Ward's, Filter Queen vacuums, all beef franks, and King Kong.
Yet for all that Pink Steam is not kitschy, it is a culturally astute
document of the real written by a master at the height of her powers."

-Jennifer Moxley


"Bellamy is David Lynch in print, teen porn under fluorescent lights,
a sandpaper jumpsuit sandy side in. She drops casual, humble,
hysterical hints for the less pop-culturally literate. She
demystifies romance like studying poop up close in the toilet. She
loves ugly. Bodily juices, death, class, and hopelessness, all
magnified under her snarky, so-fucked-it's-funny, post-feminist
glare. This is the Punk Aesthetic."

-Lynn Breedlove, author of Godspeed: A Novel


"If anyone can drag the sleeping, stagnant beast of contemporary literature
into the future, [Bellamy] can."

-Brian Pera, author of Troublemaker

Sorry, I never understood Kylie as camp icon. I agree she has a certain
amount of trashy glam, but I reckon others do that with more wit.  No
exploitation?  What's the focus on her bum then?  Punk sensibility?  John
Lydon would faint. Pure product, our Kylie; maybe to be admired for that,
though I would rather spend my time admiring other commodities.

Kylie also does stuff with the top undeground Hip Hip artist like
braintax of Lowlife records.
as for john Lydon,  I can't speak for him. ...and John does not speak
for punk cuz punk wasn't invented in 1977. It died in 77. It actually
came out about in NYC with Richard Hell and The Ramones which goes back
to 1974, along with the NY Dolls who Malcolm Maclearen managed prior to
moving back to the US and commericalizing the scene -- he actaully used
situationism with a healthy mixture of daDa to sweeten the assault.
Johnny seems to have been one the few people who caught the idea of the
Con/Swindle which Maclearen was pulling on, what would become the god
for a semi-literate generation following a marketing scam called Hip
Hop--the INDUSTRY. So Johnny called his first solo deally with "Public
Image Ltd" (natch) was entitled "First Edition" then he "Second Edition"
and later came out with "Album" and "CD" and "Video". The UK always knew
the marketing joke what is pop (XTC "This Is PoP" as an example) and the
music scene in general. It was either you joined the circus or exploited
it via anarchy (Crass becomes the pop group Cumbawumba). Look at Roxy
Music's first release where in cult statis it is called "Pinup" to mock
the sex sales aspect of amerikkka.

sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first

free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Hi Ishaq - I have an anglocentric view of punk - what happened in the UK
seems to me qualitatively different from the NY Dolls and the Ramones, all
that English music hall and Thatcherite despair gave it another edge.  Yes,
it fizzled out quickly, Malcolm McLaren gave us the unedifying image of Sid
Vicious and the rest of them looking like cute Cliff Richards piling into a
car for summer holidays, and now we can merely ponder its ironies.  But its
very ephemerality exposed consumer mass culture in most interesting way. I
note interestedly punk (both US and UK) has made a comeback among young
teens here in a kind of nihilistic/idealistic cross with Japanese
consumerist eclecticism, and links itself consciously with Green Left social
activism.  Loads of problems there but also interesting energies.

I've watched Kylie for years and still don't get it.  But I didn't get
Madonna either.  Or it could be just because I'm a Melbourne girl as well,
which creates its own blindnesses towards the all-too-familiar, just as in
the case of Nick Cave, a good Geelong Grammar boy just as I am a good
Ballarat Grammar girl.  (I never got Birthday Party either, all too
self-consciously gothic for me, I much preferred the wit of something like
Wall of Voodoo). I thought the Kylie/Cave thing pretty crappy, exploitative
on both sides.

Cheers

One of my favorite memories: being backstage at the Newport Jazz Festival a
couple years ago -- when Ray Charles came down the corridor toward the stage my
daughter, 1 1/2 at the time, lunged out and sort of high-fived his lapel.
She's almost 4 now; we've got "Tell the Truth" playing and she's dancing around
the family room as I type this.   -m.

Didn't know the universe slept. But if it does, should
I sleep better or worse for it?

Insomnia's the shits and I wouldn't wish it on any one
or thing. Kathryn Davis:

"What you want is always out of reach when you can't
sleep. You can only have what you don't want, or what
you thought you wanted, lurching toward you,
unspeakable horror.... Oh there's nothing empty about
insomnia; it's full to bursting! Chains of thought,
some miniscule, tinnily chime in your pricked ear;
some, immense, wind Laocoön-like around your twitching
limbs. You think you're waiting but you're not; you're
awaited, though not by sleep. Insomnia is the wish to
be immortal, granted by an ass." (Kathryn Davis)

The day of Reagan's funeral is a good day to read these statements by
Vonnegut.  My mother has been watching the week's events on TV, rapt.  She was NOT a
Reaganite before, but I think Nancy's selflessness as a wife helps to make up
in her mind for Clinton's debacle, another event she watched on TV, rapt.
Reagan was president when I was 18-26.  He won in the first election I could
vote.  I didn't vote, but I went to campaign speeches in Madison.  I would have
voted for John Anderson, but people said I would be throwing away my vote,
throwing it to Reagan.  The worldview (not to mention the policies he enacted,
enacted under him) was a throwback to the 1950s and were too conservative, too
self-consciously stylized, and too conformist for us.  If we are experiencing a
backlash now, if times are striving to be very traditional today, it is partly
due to the era Reagan ushered in, itself a throwback.  While we should not
have been reactionary against our own possibilities, the culture of Reagan
tempted us to ignore some of those.  Corporate culture seems, if anything, less
hospitable than it was.  It might have been better if we had left college headed
for companies, liberal but certain of fitting in somewhere, instead of certain
only of finding refuge in schools.

On TV I like the drill team best, the low calls of the officer, "Ho, hoop,
hoom, hoop."

about xtc and punk and new york dolls and stuff

Partridge: We started calling ourselves that around 1975. We've been in
existence -- myself, Colin and Terry plus revolving fourth members -- from
1973 onwards. The original form we took was kind of punky, because we were
crazy on the New York Dolls. We were called the Helium Kids, and we used
to do our darndest to look like the Dolls, and act like the Stooges. We
chose XTC because we thought it would be a marvelously easy thing to see
in print. Which it is -- people always do put it in capitals -- they're
forced to give us respect! It was kind of like the music, short and sharp
and hopefully with no unnecessary crap in it.

No Irony in our House

Andy: ``In 1976 I read a tiny review of a group called The Sex Pistols and
the journalist was looking for words to describe them and their music. I
thought how stupid a lot of writers are, trying to find categories and
names for things when surely if you're in a group to be popular and your
music becomes popular then you are a pop group, making pop music. Despite
what haughty, clever or elitist tags you are given or claim for yourself.
If you don't want to get wet stay out of the pool.''

Peace Alison,

Madonna is of another school of pop. She was out to exploit the
postmodern explosion as it settled into the college campuses and
suburbs. It was a mass market medium cool of gay ghetto chic with
ambiguous messages of naughty sex for the rebelling puritans,
discovering homosexuality; latching onto their desires and calling it
"queer" while rockin the latest stickers on the softcore s/m chiccism.
Kylie is just an extension of the smart pop and thatcherite/reaganomics
(neo Augustan empire). It was the Stock Aiken and Waterman
overproduction of reusable backing tracks a la Motwon -- as the crew and
others summoned a transient neo San Francisco Patrick Cowley era of the
pounding HiNRG of the lamented Moby Dick records. It was the club scene
coming out a coma induced by shock with the coming of the AIDS hysteria.
It was something inwhich the Pet Shop Boys dared to lambaste with the
return of the dreaded word "disco" in small fonts accompanied by Gilbert
and George panorama (or panninaro) 2D landscapes = videos and glossies.
They re-explored the rent boy and gentlemen dynamics and performed a
dumbshow -- the exploited and the exploiter = their thesis "I've go the
brains/you've got he brawn/let's make lots of money".  We would we see
how that worked out in the poppyshow what will become hip-hop and the
thug culture. The amerikkkan marketing system exploits a seemingly
willing new generation of amerikkkan product -- the negrow. It's funny
how this gets turned round with the Putsch shop boys = Blaire and Bush
(brains and brawn respectively).

The NYC punk was mostly about art and the idea of art and the
exploitation of art as a rebellious force at ground/grassroots level =
raDICAL CHIC. North ameriKKKa would forward the punk struggle under the
new title of Hardcore (LA - Los Angeles) when it became a "voice of the
people" (as Prince Buster coined the phrase for Jamaican Ska and Rock
Steady a few decades earlier) when it involved itself with concepts of
social realism and not the surreal literary and sonic landscapes of
William S. Burroughs and John Cage.

The Uk had set off in the direction of political and social commentary
earlier than the US punk scene, however; not the US Black Funk
underground.  We hear Crass and poetry over freestyle punk riffs or we
can hear Nikki Giovanni flex wisDOME over gospel chants or George
Clinton calling a parliament and attacking ameriKKKa from the Mothership.
Either way they were calling for a collapsing of the state and this
means payback.

Patti Smith falls into a balance hemisphere of these 3 assaults. Smith
was composing poems over pop tunes and wasted recycled rock and rock n'
roll riffs assembled in various orders as Smith set forth on a journey
from the social realism then to the Burroughological surreal --
following through and fusing them into an energy of rebellion all
tumbling and colliding and decaying into Cage like sonics.

Smith viewed rock and rock 'n roll, and was one of the first to do so,
as a lifestyle and viable product of revolution

"...at heart I am a Muslim/at heart I am an American artist"
--Patti Smith

Kylie is far from this and then again not. She is the result of smart
pop scene fun and frivolity or the "most stylish white woman" in the
world (I'm not sure if she beats Catherine Deneuve)  instead of Madonna

oppressed.

So this is pop and this where punk is at now, as you have observed.

"It is one of the greatest ironies of the Plame affair that the Bush
administration, spawned and nurtured by oil, might have committed
suicide by vindictively, cruelly and unthinkingly exacting personal
retribution on an intelligence officer who had committed no offense,
and who was, quite possibly, providing the administration with critical
oil-related intelligence which the President needed to manage our shaky

COUP D'ETAT:
The Real Reason Tenet and Pavitt Resigned from the CIA on June 3rd and
4th
Bush, Cheney Indictments in Plame Case Looming

JUNE 8, 2004 1600 PDT (FTW) - Why did DCI George Tenet suddenly resign
on June 3rd, only to be followed a day later by James Pavitt, the CIA's
Deputy Director of Operations (DDO)?

The real reasons, contrary to the saturation spin being put out by
major news outlets, have nothing to do with Tenet's role as taking the
fall for alleged 9/11 and Iraqi intelligence "failures" before the
upcoming presidential election.

Both resignations, perhaps soon to be followed by resignations from
Colin Powell and his deputy Richard Armitage, are about the imminent
and extremely messy demise of George W. Bush and his Neocon
administration in a coup d'etat being executed by the Central
Intelligence Agency. The coup, in the planning for at least two years,
has apparently become an urgent priority as a number of deepening
crises threaten a global meltdown.

Based upon recent developments, it appears that long-standing plans and
preparations leading to indictments and impeachment of Bush, Cheney and
even some senior cabinet members have been accelerated, possibly with
the intent of removing or replacing the entire Bush regime prior to the
Republican National Convention this August.

FTW has been documenting this Watergate-like coup for more than fifteen
months and almost everything we will discuss about recent events was
predicted by us in the following pages: Please see our stories "The
Perfect Storm - Part I" (March 2003); "Blood in the Water" (July 2003);
"Beyond Bush - Part I" (July 2003); "Waxman Ties Evidentiary Noose
Around Rice and Cheney" (July 2003); and "Beyond Bush - Part II"
(October 2003).

There were two things we didn't get right. One was the timing. We
predicted the developments taking place now as likely to happen after
the November election, not before. Secondly, we did not foresee the
sudden resignations of Tenet and Pavitt. Understanding the resignations
is the key to understanding a deteriorating world scene and that
America is on the precipice of a presidential and constitutional crisis
that will ultimately dwarf the removal of Richard Nixon in 1974.

So why did Tenet and Pavitt resign? We'll explain why and we will
provide many clues along the way as we make our case.

HIGH CRIMES AND REALLY STUPID MOVES

Shortly after the "surprise" Tenet-Pavitt resignations, current and
former senior members of the U.S. intelligence community and the
Justice Department told journalist Wayne Madsen, a former Naval
intelligence officer, that they were directly connected to the criminal
investigation of a 2003 White House leak that openly exposed Valerie
Plame as an undercover CIA officer. What received less attention was
that the leak also destroyed a long-term CIA proprietary intelligence
gathering operation which, as we will see, was of immense importance to
US strategic interests at a critical moment.

The leak was a vindictive retaliation for statements, reports and
actions taken by Plame's husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson,
which had deeply embarrassed the Bush administration and exposed it to
possible charges for impeachable offenses, including lying to the
American people about an alleged (and totally unfounded) nuclear threat
posed by Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Conservative columnist Robert Novak,
the beneficiary of the leak, immediately published it on July 14, 2003
and Valerie Plame's career (at least the covert part) instantly ended.
The actual damage caused by that leak has never been fully appreciated.

Wilson deeply embarrassed almost every senior member of the Bush junta
by proving to the world that they were consciously lying about one of
their most important justifications for invading Iraq: namely, their
claim to have had certain knowledge, based on "good and reliable"
intelligence, that Hussein was on the brink of deploying a nuclear
weapon, possibly inside the United States. It was eventually disclosed
that the "intelligence" possessed by the administration was a set of
poorly forged documents on letterhead from the government of Niger,
which described attempts by Iraq to purchase yellowcake uranium for a
nuclear weapons program.

It has since been established by Scott Ritter and others that Iraq's
nuclear weapons program had been dead in the water and non-functioning
since the first Iraq war.

Wilson was secretly dispatched in February 2002, on instructions from
Dick Cheney to the CIA, to go to Niger and look for anything that might
support the material in the documents. They had already been dismissed
as forgeries by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the CIA, and
apparently everyone else who had seen them. The CIA cautioned the
administration, more than once, against using them. Shortly thereafter,
Wilson returned and gave his report stating clearly that the
allegations were pure bunk and unsupportable.

In spite of this, unaware of the booby traps laid all around them, the
entire power core of the Bush administration jumped on the Niger
documents as on a battle horse and charged off into in a massive public
relations blitz. Bush, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld, Powell, Wolfowitz and
others - to varying degrees - insisted, testified, and swore that they
knew, and had reliable, credible and verified intelligence that Saddam
was about to deploy an actual nuclear device built from the Niger
yellowcake.

It was full court media press and they successfully scared the pants
off of most Americans who believed that Saddam was going to nuke them
any second.

George Bush made the charge and actually cited the documents in his
2003 State-of-the-Union address, even after he had been cautioned by
George Tenet not to rely on them. In a major speech at the United
Nations, Colin Powell charged that Iraq was on the verge of deploying a
nuke and had been trying to acquire uranium. Dick Cheney charged in
several speeches that Saddam was capable of nuclear terror. And shortly
before the invasion, when asked in a television interview whether there
was sufficient proof and advance warning of the Iraqi nuclear threat, a
smug and confident Condoleezza Rice quipped, "If we wait for a smoking
gun, that smoking gun may be a mushroom cloud over an American city."
Rice was lying through her teeth.

By July of 2003, as the Iraqi invasion was proving to be a protracted
and ill-conceived debacle, executed in spite of massive resistance from
within military, political, diplomatic and economic cadres, there was
growing disgust within many government circles about the way the Bush
administration was running things. The mention of Wilson's report came
in July though his name was not disclosed. It suggested corroborative
evidence of criminal, rather than stupid, behavior by the
administration. The San Francisco Chronicle reported:

A senior CIA official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
intelligence agency informed the White House on March 9, 2002 - 10
months before Bush's nationally televised speech - that an agency
source who had traveled to Niger could not confirm European
intelligence reports that Iraq was attempting to buy uranium from the
West African country.

Note the reference to an Agency source.

It was inevitable that Wilson would move from no comment, to statements
given on condition of anonymity, and finally into the public spotlight.
That he did, in a July 6th New York Times Editorial titled "What I
Didn't Find in Africa." Soon he was giving interviews everywhere.

On July 14th Novak published the column outing Wilson's wife, Valerie
Plame. As a result, any criminal investigation of the Plame leak will
also go into the Niger documents and any crimes committed which are
materially related to Plame's exposure.

Instead of retreating, Wilson advanced. In Septmeber he went public,
writing editorials and granting interviews which thoroughly exposed the
Bush administration's criminal use of the documents, Cheney's lies
about the mission, and all the other lies used to deceive the American
people into war.

At the moment he went on the record, Wilson became another legally
admissible, corroborative evidentiary source; a witness available for
subpoena and deposition, ready to give testimony to the high crimes and
misdemeanors he has witnessed.

First Clue: James Pavitt was Valerie Plame's boss. So was George Tenet.

HOW THE TRAP WAS SET

Conflicting news reports suggest that perhaps several sets of the
documents were delivered simultaneously to several recipients. I could
find only one news story (out of almost 60 I have reviewed) which
indicated just when the Niger papers were first put into play. One of
the most fundamental questions in journalism, "when?" was omitted from
every major press organization's coverage except for a single story
from the Associated Press on July 13th.

-----
=8A [T]he forged Niger government documents, showing attempts by Iraq to
purchase yellowcake, were delivered by unknown sources to a journalist
working for Italy's Corriere della Sera which then gave them to the
Italian intelligence service. She then reportedly gave them to Italian
intelligence agents who gave them to the US embassy. Seymour Hersh of
the New Yorker also offered this version indicating that the documents
had surfaced in Italy in the fall of 2001.
-----

The fall of 2001. That means that the documents were created no more
than three and a half months after September 11th.

The earliest press report mentioning the documents was a March 7, 2003
story in The Financial Times. On that day, Mohammed El Baradei, head of
the International Atomic Energy Agency reported to the UN Security
Council that the documents were forgeries. The story contained a
revealing paragraph.

-----
"The allegation about the uranium purchase first surfaced in a UK
government dossier published on September 24 last year about Iraq's
alleged weapons programmes, though it did not name Niger. Niger was
first named when the US State Department elaborated on the allegations
on December 19 [2002]=8A
-----

Canada's Globe and Mail reported on March 8, 2003:

-----
=8A[T]he forgeries were sold to an Italian intelligence agent by a con
man some time ago and passed on to French authorities, but the scam was
uncovered by the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] only
recently, according to United Nations sources familiar with the
investigation. The documents were turned over to the IAEA several weeks
ago.

"In fact, the IAEA says, there is no credible evidence that Iraq tried
to import uranium ore from the Central African country in violation of
UN resolutions.

"Based on thorough analysis, the IAEA has concluded, with the
concurrence of outside experts, that these documents, which formed the
basis for the reports of these uranium transactions between Iraq and
Niger, are, in fact, not authentic," Mr. El Baradei told the UN
Security Council Friday=8A.
-----

The Chicago Tribune reported on March 13, 2003, "Forged documents that
the United States used to build its case against Iraq were likely
written by someone in Niger's embassy in Rome who hoped to make quick
money, a source close to the United Nations investigation said.

The Washington Post gave yet a different story, also on March 8, 2003:

-----
=8AKnowledgeable sources familiar with the forgery investigation
described the faked evidence as a series of letters between Iraqi
agents and officials in the central African nation of Niger. The
documents had been given to the U.N. inspectors by Britain and reviewed
extensively by U.S. intelligence. The forgers had made relatively crude
errors that eventually gave them away - including names and titles that
did not match up with the individuals who held office at the time the
letters were purportedly written, the officials said=8A"

=8AThe CIA, which had also obtained the documents, had questions about
"whether they were accurate," said one intelligence official, and it
decided not to include them in its file on Iraq's program to procure
weapons of mass destruction.
-----

In a follow-up story on March 13th the Post reported:

-----
It's something we're just beginning to look at," a senior law
enforcement official said yesterday. Officials are trying to determine
whether the documents were forged to try to influence U.S. policy, or
whether they may have been created as part of a disinformation campaign
directed by a foreign intelligence service...

=8AThe phony documents - a series of letters between Iraqi and Niger
officials showing Iraq's interest in equipment that could be used to
make nuclear weapons - came to British and U.S. intelligence officials
from a third country. The identity of the third country could not be
learned yesterday.
-----

What if it wasn't a foreign intelligence service? I had been suspicious
that a Watergate-like coup was forming immediately after reading the
first few stories about the documents. I was convinced when the AP
reported on March 14, 2003 (just days before the Iraqi invasion) that
the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee had called
for an FBI investigation of the documents' origins. The Boston Globe
reported two days later that the Senator was specifically seeking to
determine whether administration officials had forged the documents
themselves to marshal support for the invasion.

The request was not nearly as significant to me as who it had come from
- Jay Rockefeller of the Standard Oil Rockefellers. An oil dynasty was
calling for an investigation of a bunch of oil men. Somebody was
screwing up big time.

Seymour Hersh dropped a major bombshell that went virtually unnoticed,
54 paragraphs deep into an October 27, 2003 story for the New Yorker
titled "The Stovepipe."

-----
Who produced the fake Niger papers? There is nothing approaching a
consensus on this question within the intelligence community. There has
been published speculation about the intelligence services of several
different countries. One theory, favored by some journalists in Rome,
is that [the Italian intelligence service] Sismi produced the false
documents and passed them to Panorama for publication.

"Another explanation was provided by a former senior C.I.A. officer. He
had begun talking to me about the Niger papers in March, when I first
wrote about the forgery, and said, 'Somebody deliberately let something
false get in there.' He became more forthcoming in subsequent months,
eventually saying that
_a_small_group_of_disgruntled_retired_C.I.A._clandestine_operators_had_b
anded_together_in_the_late_summer_of_last_year_and_drafted_the_fraudulen
t_documents_themselves. [emphasis added]
-----

Hersh's revelation provided corroboration for something I and others,
like the renowned political historian Peter Dale Scott, had been
suspecting for a long time. The CIA was fighting back. This was a well
orchestrated, long-term covert operation - exactly what the CIA does
all over the world.

POINT OF NO RETURN

Willing disclosure of the identity of a covert operative is a serious
felony under Federal law, punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. The
Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 makes it a crime for
anyone with access to classified information to intentionally disclose
information identifying a covert operative. The penalties get worse for
doing it to a deep cover Direcorate of Operations (DO) case officer (as
opposed to an undercover DEA Agent).

After John Ashcroft was forced to recuse himself from the case, Patrick
Fitzgerald, the U.S. Attorney in Chicago, was transferred to Washington
and appointed special prosecutor in the Plame case.

Robert Novak, rightly standing by the journalistic code of ethics, has
steadfastly refused to identify his White House source. We would do the
same thing in his shoes. The investigation is nearing a climax with
pending issuance of criminal indictments. Press reports citing sources
close to the investigation have directly and indirectly pointed fingers
at Dick Cheney and his Chief of Staff, Lewis "Scooter" Libby, as
suspects.

Second clue: The criminal investigation of the Plame leak was
investigated after a September 2003 formal request from the CIA,
approved by George Tenet.

Not only was Plame's cover blown, so was that of her cover company,
Brewster, Jennings & Associates. With the public exposure of Plame,
intelligence agencies all over the world started searching data bases
for any references to her (TIME Magazine). Damage control was
immediate, as the CIA asserted that her mission had been connected to
weapons of mass destruction.

However, it was not long before stories from the Washington Post and
the Wall Street Journal tied Brewster, Jennings & Associates to energy,
oil and the Saudi-owned Arabian American Oil Company, or ARAMCO.
Brewster Jennings had been a founder of Mobil Oil company, one of
Aramco's principal founders.

According to additional sources interviewed by Wayne Madsen, Brewster
Jennings was, in fact, a well-established CIA proprietary company,
linked for many years to ARAMCO. The demise of Brewster Jennings was
also guaranteed the moment Plame was outed.

It takes years for Non-Official Covers or NOCs, as they are known, to
become really effective. Over time, they become gradually more trusted;
they work their way into deeper information access from more sensitive
sources. NOCs are generally regarded in the community as among the best
and most valuable of all CIA operations officers and the agency goes to
great lengths to protect them in what are frequently very risky
missions.

By definition, Valerie Plame was an NOC. Yet unlike all other NOCs who
fear exposure and torture or death from hostile governments and
individual targets who have been judged threats to the United States,
she got done in by her own President, whom we also judge to be a
domestic enemy of the United States.

Moreover, as we will see below, Valerie Plame may have been one of the
most important NOCs the CIA had in the current climate. Let's look at
just how valuable she was.

ARAMCO

According to an April 29, 2002 report in Britain's Guardian, ARAMCO
constitutes 12% of the world's total oil production; a figure which has
certainly increased as other countries have progressed deeper into
irreversible decline.

ARAMCO is the largest oil group in the world, a state-owned Saudi
company in partnership with four major US oil companies. Another one of
Aramco=B9s partners is Chevron-Texaco which gave up one of its board
members, Condoleezza Rice, when she became the National Security
Advisor to George Bush. All of ARAMCO=B9s key decisions are made by the
Saudi royal family while US oil expertise, personnel and technology
keeps the cash coming in and the oil going out. ARAMCO operates,
manages, and maintains virtually all Saudi oil fields =AD 25% of all the
oil on the planet.

It gets better.

According to a New York Times report on March 8th of this year, ARAMCO
is planning to make a 25% investment in a new and badly needed refinery
to produce gasoline. The remaining 75% ownership of the refinery will
go to the only nation that is quickly becoming America's major world
competitor for ever-diminishing supplies of oil: China.

Almost the entire Bush administration has an interest in ARAMCO.

The Boston Globe reported that in 2001 ARAMCO had signed a $140 million
multi-year contract with Halliburton, then chaired by Dick Cheney, to
develop a new oil field. Halliburton does a lot of business in Saudi
Arabia. Current estimates of Halliburton contracts or joint ventures in
the country run into the tens of billions of dollars.

So do the fortunes of some shady figures from the Bush family's past.

As recently as 1991 ARAMCO had Khalid bin Mahfouz sitting on its
Supreme Council or board of directors. Mahfouz, Saudi Arabia's former
treasurer and the nation's largest banker, has been reported in several
places to be Osama bin Laden's brother in law. However, he has denied
this and brought intense legal pressure to bear demanding retractions
of these allegations. He has major partnership investments with the
multi-billion dollar Binladin Group of companies and he is a former
director of BCCI, the infamous criminal drug-money laundering bank
which performed a number of very useful services for the CIA before its
1991 collapse under criminal investigation by a whole lot of countries.

As Saudi Arabia's largest banker he handles the accounts of the royal
family and - no doubt - ARAMCO, while at the same time he is a named
defendant in a $1 trillion lawsuit filed by 9/11 victim families
against the Saudi government and prominent Saudi officials who, the
suit alleges, were complicit in the 9/11 attacks.

Both BCCI and Mahfouz have historical connections to the Bush family
dating back to the 1980s. Another bank (one of many) connected to
Mahfouz - the InterMaritime Bank - bailed out a cash-starved Harken
Energy in 1987 with $25 million. After the rejuvenated Harken got a
no-bid oil lease in 1991, CEO George W. Bush promptly sold his shares
in a pump-and-dump scheme and made a whole lot of money.

Knowing all of this, there's really no good reason why the CIA should
be too upset, is there? It was only a long-term proprietary and
deep-cover NOC - well established and consistently producing "take"
from ARAMCO (and who knows what else in Saudi Arabia). It was destroyed
with a motive of personal vengeance (there may have been other motives)
by someone inside the White House.

 From the CIA's point of view, at a time when Saudi Arabia is one of the
three or four countries of highest interest to the US, the Plame
operation was irreplaceable.

Third clue: Tenet's resignation, which occurred at night, was the first
"evening resignation" of a Cabinet-level official since October 1973
when Attorney General Elliott Richardson and his deputy, William
Ruckelshaus, resigned in protest of Richard Nixon's firing of Watergate
special prosecutor Archibald Cox. Many regard this as the watershed
moment when the Nixon administration was doomed.

SAUDI ARABIA

Given that energy is becoming the most important issue on the planet
today, if you were the CIA, you might be a little pissed off at the
Plame leak. But there may be justification to do more than be angry.
Anger happens all the time in Washington. This is something else.

One of the most important intelligence prizes today - especially after
recent stories in major outlets like the New York Times reporting that
Saudi oil production has peaked and gone into irreversible decline -
would be to know of a certainty whether those reports are correct. The
Saudis are denying it vehemently but they are being strongly refuted by
an increasing amount of hard data. The truth remains unproven. But the
mere possibility has set the world's financial markets on edge. Saudi
Oil Minister Ali Naimi came to Washington on April 27th to put out the
fires. It was imperative that he calm everybody's nerves as the markets
were screaming, "Say it ain't so!"

Naimi said emphatically that there was nothing to worry about
concerning either Saudi reserves or ARAMCO's ability to increase
production. There was plenty of oil and no need for concern.

FTW covered and reported on that event. Writer and energy expert Julian
Darley noted that there were some very important ears in the room,
listening very closely. He also noted that Naimi's "scientific" data
and promises of large future discoveries did not sit well (with )many
who are well versed in oil production and delivery.

[See FTW's June 2nd story, "Saudi's Missing Barrels"

http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/
060104_darley_saudi_summary.html

and our May 2003 story, "Paris Peak Oil Conference Reveals Deepening
Crisis."

http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/053103_aspo.html

In that story FTW editor Mike Ruppert was the first to report on
credible new information that Saudi Arabia had possibly peaked.]

If anybody has the real data on Saudi fields it is either ARAMCO or the
highest levels of the Saudi royal family.

The answer to the Saudi peak question will determine whether Saudi
Arabia really can increase production quickly, as promised. If they
can't, then the US economy is going to suffer bitterly, and it is
certain that the Saudi monarchy will collapse into chaos. Then the
nearby US military will occupy the oilfields and the U.S. will
ultimately Balkanize the country by carving off the oil fields - which
occupy only a small area near the East coast. That U.S. enclave would
then provide sanctuary to the leading members of the royal family who
will have agreed to keep their trillions invested in Wall Street so the
US economy doesn't collapse.

So far the Saudis haven't had to prove that they could increase
production due to convenient terror attacks at oil fields, and more
"debates" within OPEC.

Fourth clue: Bush and Cheney have both hired or consulted private
criminal defense attorneys in anticipation of possible indictments of
them and/or their top assistants in the Plame investigation. On June 3,
just hours before Tenet suddenly resigned, President Bush consulted
with and may have retained a criminal defense attorney to represent him
in the Plame case.

According to various press reports Bush has either retained or
consulted with powerhouse attorney Jim Sharp, who represented
Iran-contra figure retired Air Force Major General Richard Secord;
Enron's Ken Lay; and Watergate co-conspirator Jeb Stuart Magruder. All
three were facing criminal rather than civil charges. Either way, a
clear signal has been sent that Bush expects to be either called to
testify (which was a precursor in Watergate to a criminal indictment of
Richard Nixon) or be named as a defendant. Either way, the President's
men are falling faster than their counterparts fell in Watergate, and
the initial targets are much higher up the food chain.

Cheney's attorney is Terrence O'Donnell, a partner of the Williams and
Connolly law firm. O'Donnell worked for then White House chief of staff
Cheney in the Ford administration and as General Counsel for the
Pentagon when Cheney was Defense Secretary under the first President
Bush. He has been representing the Vice President in criminal and civil
cases involving Cheney's chairmanship of Halliburton. These include a
Justice Department investigation of Halliburton for alleged payment of
bribes to Nigerian political leaders and a stockholders' fraud law suit
against Halliburton. O'Donnell also represented former CIA director
John Deutch when he was accused of violating national security by
taking his CIA computer home and surfing the Internet while it
contained hundreds of highly-classified intelligence documents.

SPRINGING THE TRAP

Now, seemingly all of a sudden, Bush and Cheney are in the crosshairs.
Cheney has been questioned by Fitzgerald within the last week.

The CIA Director's job by definition, whether others like it or not, is
to be able to go to his President and advise him of the real scientific
data on foreign resources (especially oil); to warn him of pending
instability in a country closely linked to the US economy; and to tell
him what to plan for and what to promise politically in his foreign
policy. In light of her position in the CIA's relationship with Saudi
Aramco, the outing of Valerie Plame made much of this impossible. In
short, the Bush leak threatened National Security.

Former White House Counsel and Watergate figure John Dean, writing for
the prestigious legal website findlaw.com on June 4th made some very
ominous observations that appear to have gone unnoticed by most.

-----
This action by Bush is a rather stunning and extraordinary development.
The President of the United States is potentially hiring a private
criminal defense lawyer. Unsurprisingly, the White House is doing all
it can to bury the story, providing precious little detail or context
for the President's action=8A

=8ABut from what I have learned from those who have been quizzed by the
Fitzgerald investigators it seems unlikely that they are interviewing
the President merely as a matter of completeness, or in order to be
able to defend their actions in front of the public. Asking a President
to testify - or even be interviewed - remains a serious, sensitive and
rare occasion. It is not done lightly. Doing so raises separation of
powers concerns that continue to worry many=8A

=8AIf so - and if the person revealed the leaker's identity to the
President, or if the President decided he preferred not to know the
leaker's identity. - Then this fact could conflict with Bush's
remarkably broad public statements on the issue. He has said that he
did not know of

http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/09/30/wilson.cia/

"anybody in [his] administration who leaked classified information." He
has also said that he wanted "to know the truth" about this leak.

If Bush is called before the grand jury, it is likely because
Fitzgerald believes that he knows much more about this leak than he has
stated publicly.

Perhaps Bush may have knowledge not only of the leaker, but also of
efforts to make this issue go away - if indeed there have been any. It
is remarkably easy to obstruct justice, and this matter has been under
various phases of an investigation by the Justice Department since it
was referred by the CIA last summer=8A

=8AOn this subject, I spoke with an experienced former federal prosecutor
who works in Washington, specializing in white collar criminal defense
(but who does not know Sharp). That attorney told me that he is baffled
by Bush's move - unless Bush has knowledge of the leak. "It would not
seem that the President needs to consult personal counsel, thereby
preserving the attorney-client privilege, if he has no knowledge about
the leak," he told me.

What advice might Bush get from a private defense counsel? The lawyer I
consulted opined that, "If he does have knowledge about the leak and
does not plan to disclose it, the only good legal advice would be to
take the Fifth, rather than lie. The political fallout is a separate
issue."

I raised the issue of whether the President might be able to invoke
executive privilege as to this information. But the attorney I
consulted - who is well versed in this area of law - opined that
"Neither 'outing' Plame, nor covering for the perpetrators would seem
to fall within the scope of any executive privilege that I am aware
of."

That may not stop Bush from trying to invoke _executive_privilege_,
however - or at least from talking to his attorney about the option. As
I have discussed in one of my prior columns,

http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dean/20040130.html

Vice President Dick Cheney has tried to avoid invoking it in
implausible circumstances - in the case that is now before the U.S
.Supreme Court. Rather he claims he is beyond the need for the
privilege, and simply cannot be sued. [Emphasis added]

Suffice it to say that whatever the meaning of Bush's decision to talk
with private counsel about the Valerie Plame leak, the matter has taken
a more ominous turn with Bush's action. It has only become more
portentous because now Dick Cheney has also hired a lawyer for himself,
suggesting both men may have known more than they let on. Clearly, the
investigation is heading toward a culmination of some sort. And it
should be interesting.
-----

Last and final clue: Under Executive Privilege, a principle intended to
protect the constitutional separation of powers, officials in the
Executive Branch cannot give testimony in a legal case against a
sitting President. The Bush administration has invoked or threatened to
invoke the privilege several times. Dick did it over the secret records
of his energy task force and George Bush tried to use it to prevent
Condoleezza Rice from testifying before the "Independent" Commission
investigating September 11th.

Former officials of the Executive Branch are, however, free to testify
if they are no longer holding a government office when subpoenaed or
when the charges are brought.

The Bush administration has proved itself to be an insular group of
inept, dishonest and dangerous CEO's of the corporation known as
America. They have become very bad for business and the Board of
Directors is now taking action. Make no mistake, the CIA works for "The
Board" - Wall Street and big money. The long-term (very corrupt and
unethical) agenda of the Board, in the face of multiple worsening
global crises, was intended to proceed far beyond the initially
destructive war in Iraq, toward an effective reconstruction and a
strategic response to Peak Oil. But the neocons have stalled at the
ugly stage: killing hundreds of thousands of people; destroying Iraq's
industrial and cultural infrastructure as their own bombs and other
people's RPGs blow everything up; getting caught running torture camps;
and making the whole world intensely dislike America.

These jerks are doing real damage to their masters' interests.

But (not surprisingly) Tenet and the CIA were and remain much better at
covert operations and planning ahead than the Bush administration ever
was. Tenet and Pavitt actually prepared and left a clear, irrefutable
and incriminating paper trail which not only proves that they had
shunned and refused to endorse the documents, the CIA also did not
support the nuke charges and warned Bush not to use them.

Where are those documents now? They're part of the Justice Department
Plame investigation - and they're also in the hands of the Congressman
who will most likely introduce and manage the articles of impeachment,
if that becomes necessary: Henry Waxman (D), of California. If you
would like to see how tightly the legal trap has been prepared, and how
carefully the evidence has been laid out, I suggest taking a look
around Waxman's web site at:

http://www.house.gov/waxman/

THE SWARM

There are a multitude of signs that the Bush administration is being
"swarmed" in what is becoming a feeding frenzy as opposition is
surfacing from many places inside the government, including the
military. The signs are not hard to find.

The June 3rd issue of Capitol Hill Blue, the newspaper published for
members of Congress, bore the headline "Bush Knew About Leak of CIA
Operative's Name".

http://www.capitolhillblue.com/artman/publish/printer_4629.shtml

That article virtually guaranteed that the Plame investigation had
enough to pursue Bush criminally. The story's lead sentence described a
criminal, prosecutable offense: "Witnesses told a federal grand jury
President George W. Bush knew about, and took no action to stop, the
release of a covert CIA operative's name to a journalist in an attempt
to discredit her husband, a critic of administration policy in Iraq."

A day later, on June 4th Capitol Hill Blue took another hard shot at
the administration. Titled "Bush's Erratic Behavior Worries White House
Aides",

http://www.capitolhillblue.com/artman/publish/printer_4636.shtml

the story's first four paragraphs say everything.

-----
President George W. Bush's increasingly erratic behavior and wide mood
swings has the halls of the West Wing buzzing lately as aides privately
express growing concern over their leader's state of mind.

In meetings with top aides and administration officials, the President
goes from quoting the Bible in one breath to obscene tantrums against
the media, Democrats and others that he classifies as "enemies of the
state."

Worried White House aides paint a portrait of a man on the edge,
increasingly wary of those who disagree with him and paranoid of a
public that no longer trusts his policies in Iraq or at home.

"It reminds me of the Nixon days," says a longtime GOP political
consultant with contacts in the White House. "Everybody is an enemy;
everybody is out to get him. That's the mood over there."
-----

The attacks have not stopped. On June 8th, the same paper followed with
another story headlined, "Lawyers Told Bush He Could Order Suspects
Tortured".

http://www.capitolhillblue.com/artman/publish/printer_4652.shtml

Journalist Wayne Madsen, a Washington veteran with excellent access to
many sources has indicated for this story that the Neocons have few
remaining friends anywhere. All of this is consistent with a CIA-led
coup.

Ahmed Chalabi

Madsen reported that the Plame probe comes amid another high-level
probe of Pentagon officials for leaking classified National Security
Agency cryptologic information to Iran via Iraqi National Congress head
Ahmed Chalabi. FBI agents have polygraphed and interviewed a number of
civilian political appointees in the Pentagon in relation to the
intelligence leak, said to have severely disrupted the National
Security Agency's ability to listen in on encrypted Iranian diplomatic
and intelligence communications.

Chalabi's leak has once again forced Iran to change equipment,
resulting in impaired U.S. intelligence gathering of Iran's sensitive
communications. The probe into the Chalabi leak is centering on
Pentagon officials who have been close to Chalabi, including Office of
Net Assessment official Harold Rhode, Director of Policy and Plans
officials Douglas Feith and William Luti, Undersecretary for
Intelligence Stephen Cambone, and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul
Wolfowitz. In addition, some former Pentagon advisers are also targeted
in the probe.

Many press reports throughout 2003 indicated that Chalabi, distrusted
and virtually discarded by the CIA, had been resurrected and inserted
into the Iraqi political mix on the orders of Donald Rumsfeld, Paul
Wolfowitz and the other Neocons listed above.

Abu Ghraib and Torture

A former CIA official told Madsen that between the Plame leak and the
Abu Ghraib torture affair, the Bush administration is facing something
that will be "worse than Watergate."

PLANNING FOR SUCCESSION

If both Bush and Cheney are removed or resign, what happens? Madsen
reported that lobbyists and political consultants in Washington are
dusting off their copies of the Constitution and checking the line of
presidential succession.

One lobbyist said he will soon pay a call on Alaska Republican Senator
Ted Stevens, who, as President pro tem of the Senate, is second in line
to House Speaker Dennis Hastert to become President in the event Bush
and Cheney both go.

It is one of the greatest ironies of the Plame affair that the Bush
administration, spawned and nurtured by oil, might have committed
suicide by vindictively, cruelly and unthinkingly exacting personal
retribution on an intelligence officer who had committed no offense,
and who was, quite possibly, providing the administration with critical
oil-related intelligence which the President needed to manage our shaky
economy and affairs of state for a while longer to squeak through to
re-election. In our opinion, nothing better epitomizes the true nature
of the Neocons.

That being said, they have to go. FTW wishes that it was as certain
that what will come after them will be better.

Glad you mentioned Patti Smith, Ishaq, she was lurking at the end of my
tongue.  She was my favourite.  (This all takes me back to when I was 16, ah
nostalgia, not that I liked being 16).  No, Kylie sure doesn't beat
Catherine Deneuve, or Helen Mirren for that matter.  (Uma Thurman?) And
surely that ice queen Kidman gives her a run for her money?

Ended up posting this &c. to my blog from work today.





http://cadaly.blogspot.com <http://cadaly.blogspot.com/>




Hi.  I know this might bounce back because I subscribe on both my
personal e-mail addresses, but I can't get to those 12 hours a day now.

This is the sort of thing all too common in the less glossy companies
(the Countrywide employees are largely working class or of working class
background; few are college-educated when they begin employment; few
send their children to college) in the private sector that I feel is not
only an extraordinary presumption (with its Orwellian "five minute hate"
quality), but pernicious -- it ultimately degrades political will --
perhaps more pernicious than the lack of free speech in the workplace.

All best,
Catherine Daly


This message is being sent to all CFC personnel by Angelo R. Mozilo,
Chairman and CEO.

In 1994, former President Ronald Reagan stated, "When the Lord calls me
home, whenever that day may be, I will leave with the greatest love for
this country of ours and eternal optimism for its future."

Ronald Wilson Reagan was born on February 6, 1911 in the town of
Tampico, Illinois.  His life's journey took him from his early roots as
a lifeguard and athlete to stardom on the silver screen.  From 1947 to
1952, and again from 1959 to 1960, Reagan served as president of the
Screen Actors Guild.  Commencing his first term in office as Governor of
California in 1966, Reagan easily won re-election in 1970.  In 1980, at
the age of 69, Reagan became the 40th President of the United States.
Known during his presidency for his supply-side economics in response to
the nation's then double-digit inflation and high unemployment rate,
Reagan urged the country to "stay the course."  The economy rebounded
into prosperity, lasting an unparalleled eight years.  Winning
re-election in 1984, he achieved an unprecedented landslide, capturing
victory in 49 states.  Fostering a strong relationship with Russian
Secretary General Gorbachev, in 1987 the two men signed a treaty to
eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles.  After his departure from
the White House in 1988, Reagan continued as the elder statesman of the
Republican Party through his last public appearances in 1994.

Tomorrow, Friday, June 11, 2004, has been declared a national day of
mourning in honor of former President Reagan.  I ask that all CFC
employees join me in observing a moment of silence.  Each manager should
lead the moment with his/her team, which will be observed at precisely
12 noon EDT (11am CDT, 9am PDT), concurrent with the 21-gun salute held
in his honor in Washington, D.C.  Please also join me in extending our
thoughts and prayers to the Reagan family in their time of grief.  Thank
you.

Ronnie's Lovely Record
By William Blum



They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Subject:      Anger on Reagan
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

The final chapter of Kenneth Anger's Hollywood Babylon II (1984)


Cut off his legs!
                                - SAM WOOD

Hedda and Louella and everyone in Hollywoold considered Jane and Ronnie the
cutest and nicest and happiest young married couple in town.  Their divorce
in 1949 set off shock waves of disbelief.  Curiously enough it was the only
divorce in history in which two Warner Bros. movies could have been named as
co-respondents.  In 1948, Reagan had told Hedda Hopper: "If this comes to a
divorce, I think I'll name Johnny Belinda co-respondent."  Wyman's star was
rising higher and higher; his was plummetting.  She had an Oscar, he didn't.
  Wyman won her Academy Award for her superb performance as a deaf-mute in
Jean Negulesco's 1949 Johnny Belinda.  Once, when the couple was dining out,
the waiter turned to Reagan and asked: "And what will Mister Wyman have?"

The only sensitive and meaty performance of Reagan's entire film career was
as amputee Drake McHugh in Sam Wood's 1942 King's Row.  It was his all-time
favorite movie.  He inflicted the picture, time and again, on dinner guests
at their house.  Wyman remarked: "I just couldn't watch that damned King's
Row any more."  During the divorce proceedings, she contented herself with
testifying that we was too absorbed in politics.

Our First Couple met cute - significantly, in a political context.  Reagan
first met the prudish and conservative young actress Nancy Davis when he
helped her clear herself of the suspicion of Communist affiliations.  Her
name had turned up on the witch-hunter's lists.  At that time, Reagan was
the liberal President of the Screen Actor's Guild.  Their first date took
place when he invited her to dinner and informed her that she had been
cleared - it was another Nancy Davis who was listed as a Commie.  They
continued dating.  The following year, Nancy gave the most uplifting
performance of her tiny film career when, as the pregnant housewife in The
Next Voice You Hear, she heard the voice of God on the radio.  The next
logical step was to marry Ronald Reagan.  They were wed in 1952.

Ronnie is getting mighty fed up on those swell guy roles he's been getting.
He wants to play a meanie for a change.
                                - RUTH ROMAN, Movieland, April, 1950

Ronnie had been a leftish Democrat during his early career; if he became a
Republican, and has since proven himself the country's most right-wing
President since McKinley, the thanks may be in large part due to Nancy.
Patricia Neal, who starred with him in three films at Warner's, opined:
"When I knew Reagan he was very liberal.  And I think he was liberal until
he met his present wife."

Nancy regarded her stepfather, the Chicago surgeon Dr. Loyal Davis, as her
real father.  This gentleman is said to have been "intolerant of
minorities."  When Nancy was in Chicago in 1980 for a campaign fundraiser,
she spoke to her husband on an amplified phone hook-up and told him, while
the assembled press listened, how much she wished he could be there, to "see
all these beautiful white people."

The only premiere I can think of this month was Bedtime for Bonzo at the
Carthay Circle which was somewhat marred by the accidental death of its
chimpanzee star the day before.
                                -GRACE FISCHLER, Motion Picture, June 1951

Subsequent to his second marriage, Reagan's career was confined to a handful
of B turkeys.  In 1954, he began a new career on television.  Ann Sheridan
says: "I remember Ronnie telling all of us not to join TV because it was the
enemy of the movies.  Next thing, he was on G.E. with his contact lenses
reading the commercials."  In 1961, he spoke at a fundraiser for the
re-election to Congress of John Rousselot of the John Birch Society.  In
1962, Reagan became a full-fledged Republican.  That same year, he was fired
from the General Electric Theatre because his off-the-tube political
speeches were too far to the right even for that company's comfort.

He was a silly young kid.  Everyone called him Little Ronnie Reagan.
                                - BETTE DAVIS

After his election as Governor of California, he promptly fired two of his
staff members at Sacramento when he learned that they were gay.  Reagan
considers homosexuality "a tragic illness" which should remain illegal.  "In
the Bible," he told author Robert Scheer, "it says that in the eyes of the
Lord, this is a great abomination."  In the eyes of many Californians, his
career as Governor was an even greater one.

When the Reagans set up housekeeping in the White House, they removed the
portrait of Harry Truman, replaced it with Calvin Coolidge, and, affairs of
state permitting, set about inviting globs of Old Hollywood Cronydom to drop
in and dine off Nancy's fancy Graustarkian plates.  The wizened happy few
have included Charlton (Moses) Heston, Jimmy Stewart, gung-ho tough-tittie
anti-Commie Ginger Rogers, Shirley Temple, and Claudette (Cleopatra)
Colbert, who was said to be among the first to advise the President to
invade Grenada--she was far from delighted at the propect of an island full
of Reds so near to her palatial Barbados estate.  When President Ronnie
calls, the old glamor pusses jump: ex-Democrat Frank Sinatra, Audrey
Hepburn, and that evergreen ski-nosed pillar of reaction, Bob Hope.  (One
pious old star caused a tizzy when her colostomy can, concealed in the folds
of her evening gown, set off security alarms.)  It's a bit like the last
volume of Proust, The Past Recaptured, in which all of the appealing
creatures we had previously met in their younger heydays reappear at a
party--as barely recognizeable gargoyles.

Reagan is a major concern.  I think we're headed for disaster . . . . I
listen to a Reagan speech and want to throw up.
                                - HENRY FONDA, Playboy, Dec. 1981

Alexis Smith enjoyed the signal honor of being the sole emissary from
Tinseltown at an October 1982 White House State Dinner in honor of President
Suharto of Indonesia.  Alexis dined on beef bearnaise and molded pear
sherbet, breaking bread with the statesman whose regime established itself
by means of execution of an estimated half-million human beings, whose Death
Squads have summarily killed over 4,000 inhabitants of his capital in recent
months, and who is practicing genocide in East Timor.

I never worked with Ronald Reagan.  I'm not happy he's President.  I was
willing to give him a chance, but he's destroying everything now I've lived
my life for.
                                -MYRNA LOY, Legends of the Silver Screen, 1982

The ingratiating star of Swing Your Lady and The Cowboy from Brooklyn has
slashed government programs that benefitted the poor, depriving thousands of
the country's underpriviledged children, so we can afford more nuclear
bombs, while his cuts in corporate taxation have ensured that his rich
supporters will get richer.  His anti-environmental stance has made his the
most "toxic" administration in American history.  (In a 1979 radio speech,
Reagan maintained that most air pollution is caused, not by chimneys or auto
exhasuts, but by plants and trees.)

He has shattered the detente carefully built up by previous administrations
and reinstated Uncle Sam as the world's policeman, using the CIA to foment
war against Nicaragua; he instituted an unprecedented stifling of the press
during his invasion of Grenada.

He has insulted vast numbers of loyal citizens by reiterating that the
anti-nuclear power movement is communist inspired.  His "devil theories" on
the Soviet Union have put us on a collision course with Russia.  In the
light of his appalling nuclear policy, the titles of several of his movies
take on a peculiarly somber afterglow---Accidents Will Happen, The Killers,
Dark Victory, and Nine Lives Are Not Enough.  Hollywood Babylon is moribund,
dead, defunct, croaked, crowbait, finito, Kaput, Kaputissimo!---with Reagaan
at the helm, we're already watching the trailer of the ultimate picture
show: Hollywood Armegeddon.

Subject:      Nancy Reagan, and the humor of Ronnie
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Now that Nancy Reagan has become our national Queen Godmother, a few notes
for those not old enough to remember.

Ronnie and Nancy presented themselves as the embodiment of American family
and moral values. She was, however, pregnant when they got married. No
scandal there except for the hypocricy.

The first act of Ronnie's adminsitration was Nancy ordering a couple of
hundred thousand dollars of new tableware for the White House. A small sum,
but at the time, during a recession, and at the debut of a self-declared
fiscal conservative, it seemed anodd symbol.

It's the custom of First Ladies to wear in public the creations of American
couture houses, to advertize the industry. The couturiers lend them for the
purpose--the gowns usually go for many thousands. Nancy decided not to
return them, until there was a public outcry from the industry.

Ronnie's appointment schdule was determined by Nancy's astrologer.

Now to the presidential humor. George Bush Sr. got a laugh at the cathedral
when he recounted that he asked  Ronnie how a meeting had gone with South
African Bishop Tutu. "Soso," Ronnie answered. Of course at the meeting Tutu
pleaded with Ronnie to have the US join the rest of the world's democracies
in imposing sanctions on the South African apartheid regime. To no avail.
Does this add to the humor?

Hi Arielle: I and a few others are just starting a Zukofsky-Niedecker group.
I will let everyone know - tho August may be premature for new critical
work. I will let Beverly Dahlen know about your issue. I believe she has
unpublished work that she delivered to the Conference on Niedecker at SF
State a couple of years back.

I cant say how many therapist friends I have spoken to this week who have
described the amount of Reagan nausea that has come into their offices. I
don't want to think this is a purely California experience though our
memories of this red baiting, race baiting, anti-University, anti-public
support of anything Governor do go back further than the list of things he
did for the benefit of the national corporate dribble up rich and the right
wing (though he brought many of his California cronies - Ed Meese and Cap
Weinberger - among them to Washington.) Instead of Iraq being 45 minutes
away from bombing the USA and Europe into oblivion it was those Communist
Sandanista's who were a 90 minute or whatever drive from wiping out Texas.
Of course, many of the sons of Ron - Negroponte, etc. - in Bush's brains
today.

So we get the funeral with the 300 page Reagan Estate manual in which ex
Senator Danforth (who brought us all on his prayer full knees the Supreme
Court appointment of Clarence Thomas) is the minister, capped off by Maggie
Thatcher's elevation of Ronnie to the Prince of Peace, doing everything but
making the claim that our actor had become Jesus reclaimed.

Of course the Bush Administration supported and maximized the final rites in
which they (too) could be immersed in this do no wrong to no man Christian
halo - don't we all look beautiful in the radiance of God.  Which was - at
least from this perspective - one hell of a way to put a religious missile
shield  between this leadership and the ever growing, transparent
relationship to the torture of prisoners in Quantanamo, Iraq and
Afghanistan.  Of course, those aren't Christians and so, what say, not to
worry.
Personally, if I were them - looking at the polls, let alone the
investigations - I would be worrying a lot.

Please excuse my rant, but what an ill making week!

Stephen Vincent

The only good thing is that this happened early, way before the election.
The ruckus and fuss will die down.

Reagan and the Bushes are close to one and the same but Reagan did it
better.

My timing may be off, Maxine. Wasn't he buried just yesterday? Which means
he doesn't rise till Tuesday.

Unless somebody remembered to put a stake through his heart, of course.

I imagine that the former presidents at the Cathedral were taking notes of
does and don'ts for their own obsequies.

Oh Please, God, No.  There have been many movies about that, in fact
it's a whole genre, called the Horror Movie.  In fact his regime
could be called the prolonged night of the living dead.

Typology of Text Manipulation (for Center for Literary Computing,
West Virginia University)


Thanks to Sandy Baldwin -

We need to implement with a simple interface if possible:

Please note many of the following overlap -

Input: Text of any sort
          keep spacings / eliminate spacings
          keep tabs / eliminate tabs

Input placed within: single file
                     array
                     hash

Output: single file of manipulated text
         with original file intact
        "core dump" of file with protocols / processes attached

Manipulations: substitution (similar to awk)
               word for word
               letter for letter
               line for line
               etc.
               In other words: Y for X

               reverse line (similar to rev)
               reverse file

WORKSHOPS

SNEAK PEEK AT THE FALL WORKSHOPS

Writing For Children and Teenagers, with Harriet K. Feder=20
4 Saturdays Oct 2, 9, 23, 30, 12 p.m. - 2 p.m.
$135, $110 for members

Is that story for kids you long to write cowering inside your head? Is =
it gasping for air beneath the clutter in your desk? Then it's time to =
come out of the drawer. Learn to capture your readers with an intriguing =
"Hook;" build Believable Characters; use a single Point Of View, =
Identify a Conflict, Show Rather Than Tell and Market your work to an =
editor,=20

Harriet K. Feder, a former editor of Tom Thumb's Magazine and instructor =
for the Institute of Children's Literature has published books for =
everyone from toddlers to teens in the US and abroad.. Her most recent =
young adult novel, Death On Sacred Ground was a 2002 nominee for both =
Edgar and Agatha awards; a Sidney Taylor Notable Book; a Children's =
Literature Choice; and a New York Public Library Teen Choice. Her =
writing has won her a Woman of Accomplishment Legacy Project Award along =
with such other Western New York notables as Lucille Ball, Joyce Carol =
Oates, Virginia Kroll, and Gerda Klein. She is a member of the Society =
of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, Mystery Writers of America, =
Sisters in Crime, Author's Guild, and Pennwriters of PA.=20

The Working Writer Seminar, with Kathryn Radeff
Four Saturday workshops: September 18, October 16, November 13, December =
11
Whole seminar: $175, $150 for members. Single Saturday session: $50, $40 =
for members

Turn Your Travel Experiences Into Articles for Newspapers and Magazines  =
September 18 =20
Writing & Selling Short Stories October 16=20
Writing Magazine & Newspaper Features: Learn the Methods & Markets, =
November 13=20
The Art & Craft of Creative Nonfiction, December 11=20

Kathryn Radeff's work has appeared in local, regional and national =
magazines and newspapers, including Woman's World, Instructor, American =
Fitness, Personal Journaling, The Daytona Beach News Journal, and The =
Buffalo News and Buffalo Spree. For the past 25 years, she has worked =
extensively as an educator emphasizing a creative approach to getting =
published.

On Novel Writing, with Linda Lavid
6 Saturdays, September 25, October 2, 9, 23, 30, November 6 10 a.m. - 12 =
p.m.=20

Time to brush off that manuscript somewhere buried, take the plunge, and =
make the commitment to write the great American novel. Yes, the brass =
ring can be yours, but first you must write the story. For both veterans =
and novices, this seminar will present the critical foundations =
necessary to assist you in writing a novel. Topics include: developing =
plots, building character, generating scenes and, finally, how to make =
it all make sense.=20

Linda Lavid is author of Rented Rooms. Here work has appeared in The =
Southern Cross Review, Plots With Guns, Wilmington Blues, and Over =
Coffee.

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.=20
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums--language and silence--and =
that language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that =
we can experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, which is =
writing-intensive rather than critique-based, we will step outside our =
familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and taverns!), =
utilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented forms. =
We will explore the structural possibilities of language to ultimately =
answer the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning and =
practiced poets will generate lots of writing in this full day of =
language play and experimentation.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist.  Her work has appeared in =
Painted Bride Quarterly, Mad Poets Reviews, La Petite Zine, Rogue =
Scholars, & New England Writer's Network.  She also has a CD entitled, =
notspeak.

Playwrighting Basics, with Kurt Schneiderman, TBA.

For more information, or to register, call 832-5400 or download the =
registration form from our website at www.justbuffalo.org

SUMMER WORKSHOP

WORKSHOP ON EXPERIMENTAL POETRY with Jorge Guitart
4 Saturdays July 10, 17, 24, and 31, 10 a.m -12 p.m. in The Hibiscus =
Room at Just Buffalo
$100, $90 members, individual classes $30, $25 members

If you are tired of the trite and expected in the poetry of others or =
your own, try your hand at playing with language in a serious, organized =
way. Let randomness and unusual combinatory procedures get you started =
in creating lines that no one could possibly have uttered or written =
before. Bring poetry back to being a most unusual collocation of words. =
Let the poem write you instead of the other way. Embark on the pleasures =
of intertextuality, stealing from famous texts and subverting their =
intentions. You will be introduced to techniques that will help you =
create hundreds if not thousands of amazing poems in a relatively short =
time.

Jorge Guitart teaches in the Department of Romance Languages and =
Literatures at UB. He has been a member of JBLC Writers in Education =
since 1984 and has led poetry workshops in Buffalo public schools. He  =
is the author of Foreigner's Notebook (Shuffaloff 1993) and Film Blanc =
(Meow Press 1996). He is represented at UB's Electronic Poetic Center.

For more information, or to register, call 832-5400 or download the =
registration form from our website at www.justbuffalo.org

Martha Deed & Cairn Hedland
Thursday, June 17, 7 P.M.
The Book Corner, 1801 Main St., Niagara Falls, NY

Martha Deed is a 4th or 5th generation writer who grew up in a family =
where reading or writing could get you excused from chores.  She began =
writing and publishing her work more than 30 years ago and continues to =
do so.  After obtaining a Ph.D. from Boston University, she worked for =
the next 32 years as a psychologist in private practice.  She began =
writing, full time, about 3 years ago.

Predominantly a performance-related artist, Cairn Hedland's poetry and =
monologue pieces are meant to be done, she says, "with a certain amount =
of theatricality."  Cairn says she feels compelled to write, and the =
communication contained within the writing often has a social component =
to it.  She feels that inspiration for her work is universal and =
especially appreciates the work of Neil Gaiman and Margaret Atwood.

Carrie Spadter &  Don Scheller
Sunday, June 20, 7 P.M.
Rust Belt Books, 202 Allen Street, Buffalo, NY

Carrie Spadter says she discovered writing in 10th grade English class =
when she was forced to listen to the Moody Blues as a class requirement. =
 Adrienne Rich, Amy Gerstler and fellow writers from Southern Indiana, =
where she spent 4 years in various endeavors, influence her present =
writing.  Carrie's work has appeared in A Linen Weave of Bloomington =
Poets, Choice Works, Portrait, The Fig, and ARTVOICE.

Don Scheller was born in New Orleans, raised in New York City and has =
lived in many places.  He's an instructor at Erie Community College-City =
Campus and at Niagara County Community College.  Don has been published =
locally and nationally in a variety of media and has taught creative =
writing workshops in several cities at the college level.  He says he =
can't imagine a life without laughter and has purposely chosen Buffalo =
as a place to live.

 My Angels, Their Pink Wings


 Who, if I pitched a hissy fit, would even
 blink a powdered eyelid

 among the angelic orders? The night sky
 is indifferent and glittery with facts.

 A third millennium giddily
 boots up and Lenin, firm and pliant

 from his glycerine bath, waits for kisses
 in the glass sarcophagus. But I too

 wish to call a meeting of the Committee
 for the Deathless Beauty

 of the Tsar, the standing Congress for
 the Recarnation of the President. I too

 wish to lie in state inside the Hall
 of Pillars, in the echoes of the Capitol

 Rotunda, cooing to my tricky one,
 crooning to my trembling Republic.

THE ZEN GARDEN by David Dooley (co-winner of the Yellowglen Prize)

The polyphony of=A0voices in David Dooley's THE ZEN GARDEN, his first
collection in nearly a decade,=A0demonstrates the touch of a masterful
narrative poet working at the height of his powers. Dooley's poems, often
resembling short stories more than lyrics, capture scenes and characters
with nuanced skill. Dooley's work is nearly unique in contemporary American
poetry.


David Dooley is the author of two books from Story Line Press, THE VOLCANO
INSIDE (winner of the initial Nicholas Roerich Prize) and THE REVENGE BY
LOVE.=A0 A native of Tennessee, he currently resides in San Diego.

"David Dooley's accomplishment...bespeaks the confidence of a magician who
gives away the secret even as he performs the trick, certain we will be
dazzled anyway."--Allen Hoey

STEREOPTICON by Pamela Harrison

STEREOPTICON is Pamela Harrison's first full-length collection. The cool
elegance of her poems does not signify a detatchment from their subjects bu=
t
instead a cold, probing eye into their deep interiors. As with the
stereopticon of her book's title, no dimension of her poetic subjects
escapes Harrison's intent gaze.

Pamela Harrison was named the PEN Northern New England Discovery Poet for
2002. Her work has appeared in a number of journals, including POETRY,
SOUTHERN POETRY REVIEW, BELOIT POETRY JOURNAL, and elsewhere.

"On the cards slipped into the old stereopticons were two separate images
that were supposed to merge as you adjusted your eyes. Pamela Harrison
infuses this metaphorical idea with the unique wisdom of her experiences in
her rich collection of poems, Stereopticon. Stanza by stanza she shows us
how each moment is alive with the past and the present, the cloaked and the
revealed. The whole book shines with this blended magic, each poem worldly,
yet fresh."=8B-Molly Peacock

THE FERTILE CRESCENT

THE FERTILE CRESCENT, winner of the 2003 Lyre Prize, is John Repp's second
full-length collection of poems. Its wry depictions of past and current
experience, tinged both with the ache of regret and the joy of fulfilment,
create a distinctive world of human connection.

"John Repp's consciousness can seek out the most shabby and plastic of our
21st-century American details (where the month of June 'unwinds=8A/with all
the happiness of management/creativity seminars') and can still report back
to us through Zen-eyes that see how everything, from 'golf club [to] steam
from a peach pie cooling,' is 'a petal/of the lotus.' And if 'the ward stan=
k
of piss and shit and state warehouse soap,' there's still a tender reverenc=
e
for 'the beauty/all about me, the beauty/in every syllable.' What a
comprehensive collection of poems, heartfelt and smart about our human
confusions!"=8B-Albert Goldbarth

A widely published poet, fiction writer, and essayist, John Repp is the
author of Thirst Like This (University of Missouri Press, 1990), which won
the Devins Award in Poetry, and four limited-edition chapbooks. Recipient o=
f
a National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowship and two
Residency Fellowships at Yaddo, he teaches writing and literature at
Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, works in the Arts-in-Education Program
of the Pennsylvania Council for the Arts, and lives in Erie with his wife,
Katherine Knupp, and their son, Dylan.

ANDALUSIAN DAWN by Nick Carb=F3

ANDALUSIAN DAWN, Nick Carb=F3's third full-length poetry collection, is a
lush, sensual collection of lyrics on interior and exterior landscapes. Man=
y
of the poems are drawn from the geographic and cultural backdrop of Spain,
where the poet spent time on a writing residency; others are drawn from the
more elusive well of history, biography, and literature itself. Andualusian
Dawn is at once Nick Carb=F3's most ambitious collection and his most
intimate, and establishes him as a major figure of his generation.


"In ANDALUSIAN DAWN, Nick Carb=F3 creates a new, sweet language. This
collection hums with tenderness, revelry, and pays special tribute to the
importance of memory. Carb=F3 shows his extraordinary range with this, his
newest collection, that will make you want to visit Andalusia and reimagine
the geography of your heart's home." --Crystal Williams

Nick Carb=F3 is the author of EL GRUPO MCDONALD'S (1995) and SECRET ASIAN MAN
(2000), which won the Asian American Literary Award. He has edited two
anthologies of PHILIPPINE LITERATURE: RETURNING A BORROWED TONGUE  (1996)
and BABAYLAN (2000). He also edited an anthology,  Sweet Jesus (2002), with
Denise Duhamel. Among his awards are grants in poetry from the NEA and NYFA
(1999), and residencies from Fundacion Valparaiso (Spain), Le Chateau de
Lavigny (Switzerland), the MacDowell Colony, and Yaddo.

Also available: A reissue of SECRET ASIAN MAN by Nick Carb=F3

SECRET=A0ASIAN=A0MAN is a hilarious and poignant look at the immigrant
experience. Ang Tunay na Lalaki (Tagalog for "The Real Man") is the Filipin=
o
Marlboro Man, a macho and bare-chested endorser of gin. But when he finds
himself in New York City and auditioning as a bit actor, disillusionment
quickly sets in: he realizes he, an Asian man, will never be a sex symbol i=
n
America. Fortunately for him, adventure ensues.

"I'm absolutely beguiled by this robust postmodern superfantasy, this
shockingly trangressive anti-colonial yarn of sex, the city, and
human-hearted Everyman, Ang Tunay na Lalaki, Secret Asian in New York who
doesn't miss an American trick. Carb=F3 is a genius and a con-artist, a
truthsayer and a sorcerer, a mensch and a perve-=8Bor is he? Who wrote this
book, anyway? Strap yourself in. Inhale these poems." -=8BMaureen Seaton,

THE LOGIC OF WINGS by Vanessa Haley

THE LOGIC OF WINGS, Vanessa Haley's first collection of poems, sculpts
memory into music through its careful, richly textured lines. Haley takes
her time in setting each scene and unfolding her lyric narratives, and the
result is poetry of unusual subtlety and cumulative power.


Vanessa Haley has been a fellow at the Virginia Center for the Creative Art=
s
in Sweet Briar and was the first recipient of the John Haines Award for
Poetry in 2001. Her poems have appeared in magazines and anthologies,
including POETRY, THE GETTYSBURG REVIEW, KARAMU, THE ALASKA QUARTERLY
REVIEW, THE HAMPDEN-SYDNEY REVIEW, READING POEMS: AN ANTHOLOGY OF POETRY
(Random House), and POETRY FROM SOJOURNER: A FEMINIST ANTHOLOGY (Illinois).
She lives in Wilmington, Delaware, where she is a psychotherapist. Prior to
this, she was an associate professor of English at Mary Washington College
in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

"Haley welcomes the hope that accompanies death's inevitable pull 'toward a=
n
abstraction called light.' This is an authentic and courageous voice-=8Ba
welcome addition to the stage of poetry."=8B-Carolyn Kreiter-Foronda

INTERMISSA, VENUS by Nicole Pekarske

The elegant poems of Nicole Pekarske's first collection INTERMISSA, VENUS
pierce the heart of their subjects with visual precision and haunting,
understated music. The rich scenes of these poems unfold greater depths in
the reader's mind long after the page is turned.

Nicole Pekarske has studied and taught in Maryland, Virginia, Missouri, and
London, and has published poems in such journals as=A0GEORGIA REVIEW,
GETTYSBURG REVIEW and RUE BELLA (UK). This is her first book-length
collection.=20

"What a delight to come across a first book so accomplished and so varied,
so willing to take on both formal concerns=A0(in the crown of sonnets), and
dramatic personae (in the leper colony!), a book willing to treat the
vagaries of the vegetable world and the travails of the individual psyche
with the same acute and unflinching, analytic tools. Nicole Pekarske's work
is informed by the Romantic poets, Keats most certainly, but also by the
subversive wit of poets like cummings and O'Hara, and this unlikely marriag=
e
yields a powerful and unexpected pleasure."--Lynne McMahon

DEENEWOOD, A SEQUENCE by Arlene Swift Jones, winner of the 2003 Tales Poetr=
y
Prize

In this taut multi-generational verse novel spoken in the voices of
different family members, Arlene Swift Jones captures the tribulations and
joys of lives rooted in a single place. This layered family chorus, singing
in minor key, is unlike any other in contemporary poetry and is richly
deserving of the 2003 Tales Prize for narrative poetry.

"Like new blood to an old line, the vivid language, passionate intelligence
and 'unshielded gaze' of Arlene Jones quicken to life the denizens of
Deenewood in this fascinating saga of presiding ghosts, blighted bridal
hopes, the emotional frost of martial men, monogrammed lives, objects that
possess their owners. With lyrical power and a searing candor, these artful
poems reveal the hidden interior of a disappearing world."--Eleanor Wilner

BILLY LAST CROW by J.P. Dancing Bear

BILLY LAST CROW is a memorable sequence of poems about the struggles of its
protagonist, a Native American, to make a life in a country in which he is
as much foreign as native. Writing in clear, unadorned lines, J.P. Dancing
Bear has created an entire life within these poems.

"BILLY LAST CROW speaks to us about the darkness of life on a reservation
and the search for identity and tradition while struggling to survive and
break through the day-to-day patterns of alcohol, violence, and poverty=8B-th=
e
isolation in this wholly American-made landscape, which the white man had
introduced into this spiritual terrain.=A0 It is a powerful work full of stor=
y
and heart and spirit.=A0 I was instantly pulled into its weave."=8B-Priscilla

FABLES FROM THE ARK by Kurt Brown, winner of the 2003 CustomWords Prize

FABLES FROM THE ARK, Kurt Brown's third full-length collection of poems, is
the winner of the 2003 CustomWords Poetry Prize. Written in spare,
understated lines, the book is a collection of darkly humorous retellings o=
f
myth and mock narratives that immerse the reader in a deeper sense of the
fragility of human history and culture. Like the animals that board the ark=
,
we could be swept away at any minute--or not. On the edge of that question,
humanity lives out its life.

Kurt Brown was born in Brooklyn, New York and grew up on Long Island and in
Connecticut where he attended the University of Connecticut. He spent many
years in Aspen, Colorado, where he founded the Aspen Writers' Conference an=
d
edited a literary magazine, ASPEN ANTHOLOGY. His poems have appeared in
SOUTHERN POETRY REVIEW, MASSACHUSETTS REVIEW, PLOUGHSHARES, HARVARD REVIEW,
CRAZYHORSE, and many other periodicals. He is the editor of DRIVE, THEY
SAID: POEMS ABOUT AMERICANS AND THEIR CARS, and VERSE & UNIVERSE: POEMS
ABOUT SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS, as well as a collection of essays about
science and mathematics, THE MEASURED WORD. With his wife, poet Laure-Anne
Bosselaar, he edited NIGHT OUT: POEMS ABOUT HOTELS, MOTELS, RESTAURANTS AND
BARS. He is also the editor of three collections of lectures given at
writers' conferences across AMERICA: THE TRUE SUBJECT, WRITING IT DOWN FOR
JAMES, and FACING THE LION. His two previous collections,  MORE THINGS IN
HEAVEN AND EARTH (2002) and RETURN OF THE PRODIGALS (1999) were published b=
y
Four Way Books.=A0 He lives with his wife in New York City.

"Aesop, Pessoa, a little Voltaire, some Dr. Wuchsal, Kurt Brown's tri-axial
collection offers up a tri-cornered playground;=A0 you can enter the ark of
one and go be with the animals of Brown's mind; you can visit with Rita (ou=
r
dog is Rita, who knew she harbored such deepening kingdoms); you can meet
T=E1dj=E8ck, if T=E1dj=E8ck exists he's the one Brown might allow as how who wrote
the other two playgrounds. We can't be sure. We? I wonder. Who's that? Some
place in FABLES FROM THE ARK there might be a hint."=8B-Dara Wier

EPICENTER by Wendy Wisner

The dark narrative sketched out in these graceful lyric poems immerses yet
distances the consciousness, like an impressionistic painting, slightly
blurred at the level of detail but made ever richer at the level of feeling=
,
of emotion. Wendy Wisner's EPICENTER is a remarkably composed (in many
senses of that word) first collection of poems and establishes her as a poe=
t
to follow.=20


Wendy Wisner teaches writing at Hunter College, where she received her MFA
in poetry. She was the recipient of an Academy of American Poets Prize and
the 2003 Amy Award. Her poems have appeared in RUNES, SOJOURNER, 5AM, MAIN
STREET RAG, and other journals. She lives in Brooklyn with her husband.

"Wendy Wisner's assured first book finds at the core of family both unease
and=A0 tenderness. Her best poems possess a strange interiority that makes
them feel lit from within."-- Mark Doty

 "I am thrilled and moved by Wendy Wisner=B9s EPICENTER.=A0 I want to invent ne=
w
words to herald the emergence of this wonderful young poet.=A0 She is
delicate, but never dainty; she is exquisitely sensitive to the nuances of
feeling that constitute our inner life, but never hermetic.=A0 These poems,
one after the other, take my breath away and give breath back to me.=A0 What =
a
great gift this book is."--Jan Heller Levi

PROTEST TO DEMAND AN IMMEDIATE END TO THE INVESTIGATION OF STEVE KURTZ
AND THE CRITICAL ART ENSEMBLE

WHEN: 9 AM, June 15, 2004

WHERE: Niagara Square, Buffalo, New York, near the courthouse (see
"Driving Directions" below for map)

PLEASE CIRCULATE THIS CALL AS WIDELY AS YOU CAN.
Check http://caedefensefund.org/demonstration.html for updates.

For background, please visit http://caedefensefund.org/overview.html
and http://caedefensefund.org/press.html.
For PDFs of signs that you can print out, please visit

London and Paris, please visit

SUPPORT FREE SPEECH AND FREEDOM OF KNOWLEDGE

Critical Art Ensemble (CAE) is a collective of internationally
recognized artists who work in public, educational, academic and art
contexts. For the past few years, their principal aim has been to help
the general public to understand biotechnology. By making scientific
research accessible to laypeople through participatory performance
experiences, CAE aims to demystify what is safe and clarify what is
dangerous about today's biotech industry.

CAE always undertake their work in a safe and considered way. The
materials they use are strictly non-hazardous, can be legally obtained
by anyone, and are commonly found in undergraduate-level biology labs.
For more on CAE's projects and the biological agents and equipment
they work with, please visit http://www.caedefensefund.org/.

A federal grand jury will convene on June 15 in Buffalo, New York, to
consider bioterrorism charges brought by the Joint Terrorism Task
Force against CAE member and University at Buffalo professor Steve
Kurtz. The grand jury is the latest installment in a bizarre
investigation in which members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force seem
to have mistaken CAE's latest art project for a biological weapons
laboratory.

According to the subpoenas served to at least seven artists, the
charges fall under Section 175 of the US Biological Weapons
Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which has been expanded by the USA PATRIOT
Act to prohibit the possession of "any biological agent, toxin, or
delivery system" without the justification of "prophylactic,
protective, bona fide research, or other peaceful purpose"
(http://caedefensefund.org/faq.html#law). Those served with subpoenas
include two founding members of CAE (Steven Barnes, Dorian Burr,
Beverly Schlee), two artists who have collaborated with CAE (Beatriz
da Costa, Paul Vanouse), and at least two other artists.

Many worry that the case could set a dangerous precedent by silencing
a group of artists for work that stimulates vital public discussion.
Many feel that with this case and others, the government is wildly
overreaching its mandate to protect the public from terrorism.

"Groups like CAE stimulate the public debate that is necessary to a
healthy democracy," said Claire Pentecost, an artist who has
collaborated with CAE in the past. "This isn't a case of one artist
fighting for the freedom to express him or herself with images or
speech that some of the public might find offensive. This is a case of
a group of artists using performance to educate the public on issues
that affect all of us in our daily lives. The government's actions
suggest a criminalization of a citizen's right to acquire knowledge by
completely legal means. This goes to the very heart of democracy."

A number of other recent cases suggest that that the PATRIOT Act and
other recent "security" measures have made freedom of speech
increasingly fragile in the U.S. A list of such cases will be
available shortly at http://www.caedefensefund.org/


ABOUT THE DEMONSTRATION: Please bring signs and banners if you can
(see http://caedefensefund.org/demonstration.html#signs). This is a
peaceful demonstration. As in all demonstrations, it's best to bring
personal identification (driver's license, passport, student id, proof
of address, etc.). Let someone know where you're going to be. Stick
with a buddy.

DRIVING DIRECTIONS: From Interstate 90 take 33W into downtown all the
way to the end. It will put you onto Oak St. Continue on Oak for 2
long blocks to Broadway. Go right on Broadway which runs right into
Court St. The first square is Lafayette and then comes Niagara Square.
There are paid parking lots all around this downtown area. Information
on possible housing will be on the website shortly.

Unlikely 2.0 has finally been released. Not merely a literary magazine, it
is a magazine of arts and culture featuring socioeconomicpoliticocultural
(I'm really smart and made that word up) commentary, fiction and nonfiction,
poetry, short Internet movies, visual art, and music available for free
download. The premiere or possibly premier or even première issue includes:

essays by Tom Bradley, Luke Buckham, Norman A. Ruben, Robert Levin, and
Jonathan Penton
the continued adventures of A Sardine on Vacation
an interview of August Highland by Aryan Kaganof
reviews of movies and e-books by Pablo Sibs and T. S. Ross
some truly disturbing memoirs by Dan Schneider and Annie McMillen
Vernon Frazer's complete novel, "Commercial Fiction"
a one-act play by B. Z. Niditch
short stories by Jessica Schneider and Drew Allen
poetry by Shane Allison, Belinda Subraman, Donna Snyder, Steve Caratzas,
John Bryan, Cherie DeGennaro and Joja
three songs available for download from the Austin fusion band, Cocentric
visual art by Scott Brennan
and Flash movies by Dan Meth and Alek Wasilewski

The site also includes a hugely enhanced bulletin board and store.

The site design is completely new, and bug reports will gratefully be
received. It is a multimedia site, and probably won't work right on machines
older than five years or so.

We are open for all sorts of submissions until future notice. We strongly
suggest reading our guidelines.

If your friends don't dance, then they ain't no friend of mine.

Subject:      Mark Rudd is a Dudd
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

the other night i went to hear Mark Rudd read from his memoir
about his days with the SDS and the Weather Underground.

granted, he was reading from a memoir, and the audience was
interested in discussing the gold old days, as was Rudd.  but
i had assumed (assumed wrong) that there would be at least
SOME discussion about the world now, about Iraq, about the
Patriot Act, etc.

the place was packed, mostly middle aged folks, smiling, and
wanting to share their own stories about marching, about the
various orgies they had participated in, and of course, what
kinds of drugs they took, which drugs they liked, and which ones
they didn't like so much.  it was SO fucking boring!

finally i got my chance to ask Rudd what he thinks --with all his
experience-- our actions should be to fight this new American
war?  he gave some disappointing answer about how the people
of this country are waking up, blah blah blah.  he didn't really
answer the question, especially when i rephrased it saying that
i asked this with keeping in mind the fact that many of his former
Weathermen comrades believe that the Peace Movement did
nothing to stop the war in Vietnam, in fact, was it Bill Ayers(?) who
said that while the Peace Movement was in full swing with more
than a million marching on DC, that the war only escalated.

i believe Chris Stroffolino once posted something on this list
stating that Bruce Andrews had written something to a
similar conclusion?  maybe i'm wrong about this.

anyway, i rephrased the question with this, and the information
that Rudd himself, as well as Bernadine Dorn are now full of
regrets for what they had done.  and, with all this in mind, what
does he say our actions should be.  he literally rephrased his
previous answer with even more exclamatory delight that people
are waking, and not going to let this become another Vietnam.

a young woman who was also irritated (visibly so) by Rudd's
inability to talk about Iraq directly, stood up and said,
"you didn't have the Patriot Act in 1970.  In fact, don't you agree
that the Patriot Act is in effect a preemptive strike against the
American public, to shut us up and shut us down before a general
despair turns the tide against this war?"

frankly, i forget what the hell he said.  he did agree with her, but
didn't have much to add.

i am glad i went to this event however, so that i can stop thinking
that there's a possibility that these people have anything new to
share in the fight against this war, and all this war stands for.
if anything, they were an amazing bunch of people who stood
up when they were younger, despite whether what they did was
right or wrong, and their stand, and their amazing courage is an
emblem to inspire.  but not something to replicate, if their present
lives are an obivous outcome for such actions.

I must say, I shouldn't say, but I'll still say that I find this tiring.
 I'm talking about any publication that doesn't accept, encourage, e-mail,
attached, submissions.
Make copies, address envelopes, find stamps, go to Post Office with your
double-spaced pages, SASE, etc., e.g., keep your art within our specs. This
is for "innovative" art? Not of _this_ century.

DOCUMENTARY ON KAVANAGH

Madam, - We are making a docmentary film about the Irish poet Patrick
Kavanagh to mark the centenary of his birth. The film is to be a
celectration of Kavanagh's life in poetry. It will be a wonderful
opportunity to record personal reminiscences and uncover personal archive
the poet. We would be delighted to hear from anyone who has stories,
memories or film or photographic material about Kavanagh.

Given tomorrow is B day - and this country (USA) is going practically
overboard with U readings (two in San Francisco), a big fancy NY one all
night in a theater with a nom nom cast of readers (to be played worldwide
over the net, by the way, on Pacifica stations), and who knows where else
with a Google search, it makes me want to ask an 'avant' question: has any
theater group or performance artist chez Dublin ever done a piece
re-enacting the time when Borjes was invited for B day and got forgot in his
hotel room for the duration (as the story was retold to me yesterday).  It
sounds like a perfecting setting for a Beckett set-up a la Waiting for G.
Does anyone know the year that this happened, where it is retold in print??

An Argentenian writer, Carlos Suares, was telling me the story here in SF. A
relative of Borjes - tho his father (a cousin of B) was an
Anarchist-Syndicalist - there was a family sense at the time that this was
appropriate punishment for B who was considered politically conservative!

Craig,

As someone who knows Rudd and the others you mention -- and who
participated in much of the same politics -- I'd like to make a few
comments in response.

Your response to Rudd and the others at the book event reminds me of our
own response to the CP and other Old Left stalwarts at their events during
the 60s.  They seemed so old and irrelevant, out of touch with the
realities, still stuck in the Flint sit-down strike, and while no one knew
officially about COINTELPRO conspiracies to marginalize and kill off Black
Panthers and others, we felt it in our bones and suspected that the old
leftists did not.  We went on without them.  You will too.  We can argue
the value of this.

Rudd makes a point of not trying to talk in details about contemporary
opposition because he does not feel he should be doing that, that he does
not want to pontificate or be seen as a leader, and this may be why he
seemed to be waffling to you.  He actually was a leader during the Columbia
strike in 1968 -- but he was promoted by the media into a new Che so much
that he has spent the rest of his life untangling himself from the media
image and trying to remove himself from being seen as a leader.

In the Weatherman film, he says how much shame he feels.  I've had an
extended conversation with him about this.  In my opinion, grievous
mistakes were made, but when middle-class kids who do not know what they
are doing are lifted by historical trends they barely understand in order
to challenge the greatest power in the world -- well, I'm not ashamed.  In
my opinion, feeling ashamed is just another subjective response, akin to
the militarist ones thirty-five years ago, and it's time to look at the
whole experience as a part of America's radical legacy.

Allen Ginsberg accused the left of immaturity during the 1968 elections --
that it was important to elect Humphrey over Nixon but that fantasies of
revolution overcame people and Nixon won by a hair.  Conditions for
revolution or more progressive change would have been more favorable if
Humphrey had won.  This is probably true, in my retrospective opinion.

The anti-war movement was incredibly powerful -- and SDS was a mass,
radical student organization that could have sustained that movement and
broadened it to other issues, if it hadn't split apart over radical
politics.  The anti-war movement -- and the left generally -- did succeed
in many aspects of social revolution that I know students I work with today
take for granted, from "the Vietnam Syndrome" to Title IX.  But, still,
1968 was incomplete, stymied.  The core of the anti-war movement was the
Vietnamese themselves -- no matter how many Americans took to the streets,
without their stubborn resistance, the machinery of empire would still roll
on.  My point: don't overemphasize the role of the left, but don't
under-emphasize it either.

These are just some desultory thoughts.  More, obviously, needs to be said.

Dear poets,

It's come to our attention that a number of you are getting multiple copies
of our e-mails. This is likely because because you have registered for
submission notification from more than one of our imprints.

We have fixed this problem by consolidating all of our imprint lists into a
single, larger list. We have updated our websites to reflect the new
organization. In the future, you will only receive one e-mail if you are on
our list. Also, if you subscribe at one of our imprints and are already on
the list, our mail server will send you a notice saying so, and your address
will not be added multiple times.

We have also set up an "unsubscribe" address that will automatically remove
you if you wish. Please see the instructions at the bottom of this e-mail.

We regret any inconvenience this problem may have caused you.

Sincerely,

More desultory remarks:

I recall sitting in a room in DC listening to Bill Ayers before the Chicago Days
of Rage and thinking to myself that these guys HAD to be police agents -- I
only finally relinquished that suspicion when, after the Weather people had
gone underground, the FBI routinely came by the house where I was living
showing us photos of Rudd, Ayers, Angela Davis etc. asking if we'd seen them
(while another agent tried to go through the mail laying on a nearby table
inconspicuously) [and by the way, our response generally was -- "Wow, I just
saw that guy at 7-11 last night!]

upshot, 30 years ago and more I had given up hope of getting anything useful
from the Weather folk, and nothing in their subsequent histories ever gave me
cause to revise that opinion -- Each HAD done something worthwhile in the past,
but by the late sixties they were well past any sensible anaylsis or theory --
let alone practice --

which is NOT to say that we don't have much still to learn from studying their
experiences --

and no, they didn't have the PATRIOT ACT then -- the police simply rounded
people up, abused them, broke into their private files etc, without bothering
to pass laws permitting them to do so --

Hi Kazim,

I am front channeling b/c I think it's an important question. Here goes:

City Lights
Coffee House Press
FC2 (Fiction Collective 2)
Soft Skull
Krupskaya, _Microclimates_ by Taylor Brady is good
Subpress did kari edwards' _a day in the life of p_ I am not sure about how
you want to deal with genre/not genre..
Atelos did Pamela Lu's _Pamela: A Novel but I don't know how much they
'look' as already have titles, according to text in back of their books
Tender Buttons did Dodie Bellamy's _Cunt Ups_ fiction, not fiction, ? oh
genre, my drudge
Laynie Browne has a "novel" I seem to remember as experimental/innovative
called _Acts of Levitation_ but I can't remember who published it. Possibly
City Lights

Also Grove has put out lots- Burroughs, Acker, Dagoberto Gilb's _Woodcuts of
Women_ (not so innovative but a beautiful book so innovative from a design
point of view)
Vintage puts out Carson and Ondaatje.. (I know these are less what you mean,
but..)
Graywolf publishes interesting things- fiction? dunno buut genre blurring
things- John D'Agata's _Hall of Fame_ and I think also _The Next American
Essay_ edited by him

Hard Press did Bellamy's _The Letters of Mina Harker_  (are they still
publishing?)

I am sure that there are more..

just off the top of..

let me know what else you turn up!

Sports writer and social commentator Ralph Wiley
passed away from a heart attack yesterday morning
at age 52. He came up covering the Oakland A's in
the early 80s, wrote for Sports Illustrated,
covering boxing, basketball, etc., and eventually
wrote several books including "Why Black People
Tend To Shout" and "Serenity: A Boxing Metaphor".
He was one of the few sports writers who
transcended sports and touched people of all ages
and backgrounds. A memorial can be found at

Prominent DC Shrink Diagnoses Bush to be a Paranoid, Sadistic Meglomaniac
By Staff and Wire Reports
Jun 14, 2004, 00:22


A new book by a prominent Washington psychoanalyst says President George W.
Bush is a "paranoid meglomaniac" as well as a sadist and "untreated
alcoholic." The doctor's analysis appears to confirm earlier reports the
President may be emotionally unstable.

Dr. Justin Frank, writing in Bush on the Couch: Inside the Mind of the
President , also says the President has a ""lifelong streak of sadism,
ranging from childhood pranks (using firecrackers to explode frogs) to
insulting journalists, gloating over state executions ... [and] pumping his
fist gleefully before the bombing of Baghdad."

Even worse, Dr. Frank concludes, the President's years of heavy
drinking=A0""may have affected his brain function - and his decision to quit
drinking without the help of a 12-step program [puts] him at far higher ris=
k
of relapse." =20

Dr. Frank's revelations comes on the heels of last week's Capitol Hill Blue
exclusive that revealed increasing concern by White House aides over Bush's
emotional stability.

Aides, who spoke only on condition that their names be withheld, told
stories of wide mood swings by the President who would go from quoting the
Bible one minute to obscenity-filled outbursts the next.

Bush shows an inability to grieve - dating back to age 7, when his sister
died. "The family's reaction - no funeral and no mourning - set in motion
his life-long pattern of turning away from pain [and hiding] behind antic
behavior," says Frank, who says=A0Bush may suffer from Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder.

Other findings by Dr. Frank:
His mother, Barbara Bush - tabbed by some family friends as "the one who
instills fear" - had trouble connecting emotionally with her son, Frank
argues. =20
George H.W. Bush's "emotional and physical absence during his son's youth
triggered feelings of both adoration and revenge in George W."
The President suffers from "character pathology," including "grandiosity"
and "megalomania" -- viewing himself, America and God as interchangeable.

Dr. Frank has been a psychiatrist for 35 years and is director of psychiatr=
y
at George Washington University. A Democrat, he once headed the Washington
Chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility.

In an interview with The Washington Post's Richard Leiby, Dr. Frank said he
began to be concerned about Bush's behavior in 2002.

=A0"I was really very unsettled by him and I started watching everything he
did and reading what he wrote, and watching him on videotape. I felt he was
disturbed," Dr. Frank told Leiby. Bush, he said,=A0"fits the profile of a
former drinker whose alcoholism has been arrested but not treated."

Dr. Frank's expert recommendation? ""Our sole treatment option -- for his
benefit and for ours -- is to remove President Bush from office . .. .
before it is too late."

White House spokesman Scott McClellan refused to comment on the specifics o=
f
Dr. Frank's book or the earlier story by Capitol Hill Blue .

"I don't do book reviews," McClellan said, even though he last week
recommended the latest book by the Washington Post's Bob Woodward to
reporters at the daily press briefing.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Turbulence Commission: "tone row poetry" by Lewis LaCook
http://turbulence.org/works/lacook

"tone row poetry" is an algorithmically mediated synaesthesia. Inspired
by 20th century composer Arnold Schoenberg's serialist music, the work
matches the English alphabet with tones from the chromatic western
scale. Every letter is a note, and a few are several. Add to this
electric guitar, digital waveform synthesizer coloring, and some
wildcard events, all performed by LaCook, and "tone row poetry" becomes
a writing machine that is also an alien orchestra.

"tone row poetry" is a 2004 commission of New Radio and Performing Arts,
(aka Ether-Ore) for its Turbulence web site. It was made possible with
funding from the National Endowment for the Arts.

Okay, well in hope of sparking a little discussion.
What did I mean when I said "innovative or
experimental fiction."?



Here are a couple of pieces from Carole Maso's essay
"Notes of a Lyric Artist Working in Prose" (page
numbers are from her book "Break Every Rule"


"The design of stars then in the sky. I followed their
dreamy instructions. Composed in clusters. Wrote
constellations of associations." (22)

"Virginia Woolf knew the illusion of fiction is
gradual even if the moments are heart-stopping,
breath-taking. There is a pattern which is only
revealed as patterns are, through elongation and
perspective,the ability to see a whole, a necklace of
luminous moments strung together. How to continue the
progression, the desire to go beyond the intensity of
the moment or of moments." (23)

"The novel's capacity for failure." (24)

"Room for the random, the senseless, the heartbreaking
to be played out." (24)

"Together, many novelists, now commodity makes, have
agreed upon a recognizable reality, which they are all
too happy to impart as if it were true...They take for
granted: the line, the paragraph, the chapter, the
story, the storyteller, character." (24)

"The novel might be muscially or visually
conceived--pictorial relationships, symphonic turns
rendered in prose." (25)

"My form is an odd amalgam--taken from painting,
sculpture, theory, film, music, poetry, dance,
mathematics--even fiction sometimes." (26)

"All too often novels are narratives of coercion
because they are too narrowly conceived." (27)

"The desire for--"  (29)

'Guantanamo: What the world should know'
Date: Saturday, June 12 @ 08:46:32 EDT
Topic: War & Terrorism

By Michael Ratner and Ellen Ray, AlterNet

The following is an excerpt from the book Guantanamo: What the World Should
Know by Michael Ratner and Ellen Ray, forthcoming from Chelsea Green
Publishing.

Ellen Ray: Why should American citizens be concerned about Guantanamo and
what is taking place there?

Michael Ratner: Americans should care about what goes on at Guantanamo for a
number of reasons. First of all, the way we are treating the prisoners there
is a scandal, an embarrassment to the people of this country and an outrage
to the people of the world. That you can take someone and put him in a
prison offshore with no legal rights whatsoever for two and a half years is
simply inhumane.

Second, our treatment of these people, who are primarily Muslims and of
Arabic ethnic origin, should be a cause of tremendous consternation because
of the message it sends to the Muslim world. Guantanamo has become iconic in
the Arab and Muslim world; it stands for the United States doing wrong and
abusing people. If we want to live in a safe world, the message we should
send is that we will treat people not like animals but like human beings.
Although we should be trying to lessen the anger toward the United States
within the Muslim and Arab world, we are not doing that; we are, in fact,
doing the opposite.

Third, we should care about Guantanamo because we should care about how
others are going to treat our citizens. If Americans - soldiers or
civilians - are picked up overseas, how do we want them to be treated? Do we
want them treated lawfully, in accordance with either criminal law or the
Geneva Conventions, or do we want them treated like we are treating the
prisoners at Guantanamo? The United States is setting an example for how
international prisoners are to be treated, and it is a terrible example.

A fourth reason we should care is what this all means for the future of the
rule of law, and for the building of societies that are based upon the rule
of law and not on the dictates of kings or presidents. For nearly eight
hundred years, since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215, our laws have
insisted that every single human being is entitled to some kind of judicial
process before he or she can be thrown in jail. The United States is trying
to overturn one of the most fundamental principles of Anglo-American
jurisprudence and international law. This is a principle that is found in
the Declaration of the Rights of Man, in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We
have gone back to a pre-Magna Carta medieval system, not a system of laws,
but of executive fiat, where the king-or in this case the president-simply
decides, on any particular day, I'm going to throw you into some prison. You
are not going to have access to a lawyer or anybody else, or even know if
there are any charges against you, or if you will ever be released from this
prison. Guantanamo has become our Devil's Island, our Chateau d'If from The
Count of Monte Cristo. The consequences of this unilateral abrogation of
fundamental law are grave, not merely for the people in Guantanamo and for
citizens of other countries, but also for every person in the United States.
If we care about civilization and the rule of law and justice, we cannot
keep treating people like this. There should be no place in the world that
is a law-free zone, no place in the world where human beings have no
rights...The key point here is that everyone picked up in a war is protected
by the Geneva Conventions. No one is outside the law. No one can be treated
arbitrarily at the discretion of his captors.

Ray: How are the Guantanamo camps set up?

Ratner: There are a series of cell blocks, one after the other, just like
storage facilities. Within Camp Delta there are levels one through four.
Within each camp there are different levels, depending on how much you've
cooperated. Level one is for the cooperators, levels two through four for
the people who don't cooperate. Then there is level four-minus. Once you get
into level fourminus, from what I understand, you're essentially in
isolation, with no utensils, maybe a little bit of cloth or something to
sleep on, but really very, very harsh conditions. There is another camp,
Camp Echo, which is considered solitary, and is primarily for those people
who are going to face commissions. There may also be people there whom the
captors consider problems. They have built two new camps, Romeo and Tango,
"R&T," which are going to be worse than the others: total isolation camps.
In these camps the detainees can be put in stripped, and after a few days
given shorts-that is all they are given to wear-which only go down to about
half a foot above the knee. These are for Muslim men who pray four or five
times a day, men whose knees are supposed to be covered. When they sit and
pray in these shorts, anyone can look into the pants and see their genitals.
This is obviously meant to embarrass them and tear down the human
personality of the people involved.

Ray: But the Pentagon claims it is treating the prisoners at Guantanamo
well, that it is a model institution, that it is respecting the prisoners'
religion, providing Muslims with prayer rugs, the Koran, and "culturally
appropriate meals."

Ratner: This is not at all true. There are many different levels to consider
in the abuses suffered there. First, there is a psychological level. People,
as far we know, have been (and are still being) rounded up and taken to
Guantanamo from all over the Islamic world, where they are put into
wire-mesh cages for observation. They are isolated from each other and
repeatedly taken into separate interrogation booths-trailers, really. A
critical psychological issue is that these people have no idea if or when
they are ever getting out. For all they know, each time they are taken out
of their cells they may well be put up against a wall and shot.

The Red Cross has said one of the most psychologically devastating things
happening to people in Guantanamo is the notion that they have reached a
dead end, that there is no way out. The psychological harm is horrendous. In
fact, one of the threats employed to make prisoners in Iraq talk, even after
they had been subjected to abuse and torture, was to threaten them with
going to Guantanamo, because everyone understood that there was little or no
chance of ever getting out of there. About one in five of the prisoners have
been put on antidepressants, psychotropics, and other drugs. In addition to
hunger strikes, there have been more than thirty suicide attempts.
Guantanamo is like Dante's ninth circle of hell. The temperature is often
110 degrees Fahrenheit, and of course the prisoners have no such thing as
air conditioning. The place is infested by scorpions and banana rats. The
detainees sleep on concrete floors, with no mattresses; the toilet is a hole
in the ground. It is a horrific situation from a physical, psychological,
and legal point of view.

Unfortunately, we have very limited information as to precisely what is
happening at Guantanamo, and there will always be dangerously cynical
arguments about whether certain conduct is literally torture or whether it
is simply cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. But both are abhorrent
and contrary to the Convention Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions.
We don't have any real observers in Guantanamo. The Red Cross goes there,
but its people cannot examine the interrogation rooms, which are separate
and secret. The Red Cross has made clear that their inability to speak
publicly on this issue should not be taken to mean that torture is not
happening there.

In May 2004, it was reported that the Red Cross had issued a report on
conditions at Guantanamo and furnished that report to the U.S. government.
While Red Cross reports are not made public, some of the details have come
out. These include stripping of inmates, short-shackling, and the use of
medical information to coerce detainees into cooperating. These coercive
techniques are precisely thosethat the released British clients have spoken
about publicly for a few months. The Red Cross publicly addressed the issue
of mental torture at Guantanamo, without using the word torture. They say
that what is happening to people's mental stability and mental health is
extremely serious, and they have condemned it very strongly, pointing out
that keeping people in a camp for two years with no rights, no lawyers, no
charges, no sense at all of if or when they might be released, has caused a
quantifiable deterioration in their mental health. One could certainly argue
that that fits the definition in the Convention of severe mental pain or
suffering. We do know from a number of the people who have been released
from Guantanamo that mental torture, the breaking down of the human spirit,
is the norm there. This is an interrogation camp, and they are consciously
trying to take away people's identities. Prisoners get toothbrushes, decent
food, and other amenities only as a reward for cooperating.

Ray: But it is now abundantly clear that there is much more to their poor
treatment than the withholding of amenities and the granting of rewards,
isn't it?

Ratner: There is definitely physical brutality. There are squads of U.S.
military personnel - the IRFs I mentioned earlier - who occasionally beat
people up, sometimes quite severely. They have held back food from
recalcitrant prisoners. There are reports that during interrogation,
prisoners are forced to kneel, sometimes for hours while they are chained to
a ring on the floor. The sleep deprivation I mentioned earlier has been
openly admitted and authorized in Guantanamo by the Pentagon. As a result of
the Abu Ghraib scandal, the Pentagon has said it is banning the use of sleep
deprivation in Iraq; it remains to be seen whether its use continues in
Guantanamo. The goal of breaking down people's will is to make them
faceless, take away their culture, their religion, and their identities. The
only chance they have to stop the endless interrogations is to cooperate.
And the fact is that eventually many of the victims do cooperate, although
cooperation may often lead to the signing of false confessions.

Ray: How intensive are the interrogations?

Ratner: The government has admitted that it conducts three hundred
interrogations a week. In mid-2004, it had 2,800 soldiers and civilians
(including interrogators) running a camp with somewhat more than seven
hundred prisoners for two years. Some of the prisoners recently released
from Guantanamo said they themselves had been interrogated as many as two
hundred times, with all kinds of different techniques. The United States is
planning to use information gained during these interrogations in the
military commissions. It is awful enough to try to gain intelligence for the
so-called war on terror through torture and coercion, but to compound that
by using coerced information in criminal proceedings is to double the
outrage. These are obviously coerced statements and totally unreliable.
After being held in isolation for two years, people will say anything,
particularly if their next meal or the avoidance of coercive techniques
depends on it.

In the early days of the camp a loudspeaker would blare out the words,
"Cooperate and you can go home," several times a day, spoken by the general
or somebody else high up. And then another announcement followed, "A lot of
people are leaving in the next few days. You can join them by cooperating."
Another message was, "We know who is telling the truth and who is lying and
we can tell. Tell the truth."

The "intelligence" about terrorism and terrorists that is coming out of the
Guantanamo interrogations is therefore basically garbage. It is simply not
reliable. Confessions and denunciations obtained under these kinds of
coercive conditions are useless, not just for a criminal trial but for
getting any real intelligence that might actually protect the people of the
world against terrorist attacks. We see example after example of that in
Guantanamo, where people have falsely confessed to knowledge about Osama bin
Laden or to having been somewhere or done something, or have implicated
others, all to get some kind of reward, even a pitiful Big Mac. They are
constantly getting people to nail one another. They will wear someone down
until, when they ask for the hundredth time "What do you know about Mr. X,"
he will finally say, "Okay, he was with me at an Osama training camp." And
then they go to Mr. X and say, "Well, this guy says you were with him at an
Osama training camp, we have the evidence, you might as well confess." Now,
this prisoner has been totally incommunicado for two years, under the thumb
of a military that can feed him or not feed him, keep the light on or not
keep the light on, give him exercise or not give him exercise, let him
shower or not let him shower, strip him or give him clothes, keep him in
solitary or not keep him in solitary, sometimes have him beaten up and
sometimes subject him to sleep deprivation. Eventually, he too is going to
say, "Yes, I was there with the other guy at the Osama camp in Afghanistan."
And there won't be a word of truth to it.

Ray: What effect does the administration's attitude toward torture have on
the people committing, allowing, condoning, or averting their eyes from it?

Ratner: The legal memos to the president and from the Justice Department
regarding the Geneva Conventions and the War Crimes Statute, which makes
criminal serious violation of the Geneva Conventions (particularly with
regard to treatment of prisoners), demonstrate that, at least since the war
in Afghanistan, the administration was planning to treat prisoners
inhumanely. Moreover, the memos indicate that the administration feared
criminal prosecution for doing so. The condoning of outlawed methods of
interrogation by those at the top obviously affects the people who practice
those techniques. Bush's actions take us all back to the Inquisition; it
really is medieval. We have to be aware that allowing Americans to engage in
torture corrodes the moral fabric of our society. To the extent that a
civilized society remains in this country, and to the extent that we have
any remaining values, they are seriously endangered.

Guantanamo represents everything that is wrong with the U.S. war on
terrorism. The Bush administration reacted to 9/11 with regressive and
draconian measures worthy of a dictatorship, not a democracy. They imposed
the very measures they condemned in other countries: indefinite and
incommunicado detentions, refusal to justify these detentions in court,
disappearances, military commissions, torture. It was a descent into
barbarism. The practices at Guantanamo spread to Iraq and other U.S.
detention centers around the world. The U.S. government has obviously lost
any moral ability to challenge such actions when taken by other countries.
It has endangered people all over the world, not only by its own conduct but
giving its imprimatur to inhuman treatment, which will embolden other
countries to do likewise. It has taken a thousand years to secure human
dignity and basic rights for all. The struggle to do so is marked by moments
like the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215, the Habeas Corpus Act in 1679,
the U.S. Constitution, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, the
Geneva Conventions, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention
Against Torture. The United States has now treated these landmarks of human
progress as naught. Of course, there has never been complete adherence to
these documents, but rarely, if ever, has there been such open, notorious,
and boastful violation of fundamental protections as at Guantanamo. But this
is not to say that I am pessimistic about the chance of returning to sanity,
enlightenment, and the rule of law.

For the last few years, we have been in a long dark tunnel with no fresh air
and no light. The president and his cohorts, who have brought us to this
state, are in trouble: trouble in Iraq and trouble in Guantanamo. That even
the Supreme Court appears to think so is a cause for optimism. We are at the
beginning of what will be a long struggle to repair the damage that the
government has inflicted on us all.

This won't hurt much

Terry Jones
Wednesday June 16, 2004
The Guardian

For some time now, I've been trying to find out where my son goes after
choir practice. He simply refuses to tell me. He says it's no business of
mine where he goes after choir practice and it's a free country.
Now it may be a free country, but if people start going just anywhere they
like after choir practice, goodness knows whether we'll have a country
left to be free. I mean, he might be going to anarchist meetings or
Islamic study groups. How do I know?

The thing is, if people don't say where they're going after choir
practice, this country is at risk. So I have been applying a certain
amount of pressure on my son to tell me where he's going. To begin with I
simply put a bag over his head and chained him to a radiator. But did that
persuade him? Does the Pope eat kosher?

My wife had the gall to suggest that I might be going a bit too far. So I
put a bag over her head and chained her to the radiator. But I still
couldn't persuade my son to tell me where he goes after choir practice.

I tried starving him, serving him only cold meals and shaving his facial
hair off, keeping him in stress positions, not turning his light off,
playing loud music outside his cell door - all the usual stuff that any
concerned parent will do to find out where their child is going after
choir practice. But it was all to no avail.

I hesitated to gravitate to harsher interrogation methods because, after
all, he is my son. Then Donald Rumsfeld came to my rescue.

I read in the New York Times last week that a memo had been prepared for
the defence secretary on March 6 2003. It laid down the strictest
guidelines as to what is and what is not torture. Because, let's face it,
none of us want to actually torture our children, in case the police get
to hear about it.

The March 6 memo, prepared for Mr Rumsfeld explained that what may look
like torture is not really torture at all. It states that: if someone
"knows that severe pain will result from his actions, if causing such harm
is not his objective, he lacks the requisite specific intent even though
the defendant did not act in good faith".

What this means in understandable English is that if a parent, in his
anxiety to know where his son goes after choir practice, does something
that will cause severe pain to his son, it is only "torture" if the
causing of that severe pain is his objective. If his objective is
something else - such as finding out where his son goes after choir
practice - then it is not torture.

Mr Rumsfeld's memo goes on: "a defendant" (by which he means a concerned
parent) "is guilty of torture only if he acts with the express purpose of
inflicting severe pain or suffering on a person within his control".

Couldn't be clearer. If your intention is to extract information, you
cannot be accused of torture.

In fact, the report went further. It said, if a parent "has a good-faith
belief [that] his actions will not result in prolonged mental harm, he
lacks the mental state necessary for his actions to constitute torture".
So all you've got to do to avoid accusations of child abuse is to say that
you didn't think it would cause any lasting harm to the child. Easy peasy!

I currently have a lot of my son's friends locked up in the garage, and
I'm applying electrical charges to their genitals and sexually humiliating
them in order to get them to tell me where my son goes after choir
practice.

Dick Cheney's counsel, David S Addington, says that's just fine. William J
Haynes, the US defence department's general counsel, agrees it's just
fine. And so does the US air force general counsel, Mary Walker.

In fact, practically everybody in the US administration seems to think
it's just fine, except for the state department lawyer, William H Taft IV,
who perversely claims that I might be opening the door to people applying
electrical charges to my genitals and sexually humiliating me.

So I'm going to round up all the children in the neighbourhood, chain them
and set dogs on them. I might accidentally kill one or two - but I won't
have intended to - and perhaps I'll take some photos of my wife standing
on the dead bodies, and then I'll show the photos to the other kids, and
finally, perhaps, I might get to find out where my son goes after choir
practice. After all, I'll only be doing what the US administration has
been condoning since 9/11.

Announcing the 17th volume in the Modern and Contemporary Poetics
series, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer


Syncopations
The Stress of Innovation in Contemporary American Poetry

Jed Rasula


Syncopations is an analysis of the sustaining vitality behind
contemporary American poetry from 1975 to the present day by one of the
most astute observers and critics in the field. The 12 essays reflect
Jed Rasula's nearly 30 years of advocacy on behalf of "opening the
field" of American poetry.
 From the Beats and the Black Mountain poets in the 1950s and 1960s to
the impact of language poetry, the specter of an avant-garde has haunted
the administrative centers of poetic conservatism. But the very concept
of avant-garde is misleading, implying organized assault. Incentives for
change can be traced to other factors, including the increased
participation of women, critical theory's self-reflection, and a growing
interest in the book as a unit of composition.
Syncopations addresses these and other issues evident in the work of
such poets and critics as Charles Bernstein, Clayton Eshleman, Marjorie
Perloff, Ronald Johnson, Nathaniel Mackey, and Robin Blaser. By
examining both exemplary innovators and the social context in which
innovation is either resisted, acclaimed, or taken for granted, Rasula
delivers an important conceptual chronicle of the promise of American
poetry.


"The insights are penetrating and unique; the perspectives deployed
enormously original; the richness of detail in the readings sometimes
striking . . . and the writing style often dazzling."
--Bruce Andrews, author of Paradise and Method: Poetry and Praxis

Kevin, one likes the not unsurprising physical ambiguity, but indeed Duncan
the Theosopher may also have been referring "at large" to the University of
the Soul and employing its diverse teaching faculties in the arts, sciences,
engineering, and law, as well. I think he'd appreciate - even insist - that
he also carried those latitudes into making the poem.

Just a thought.

To further complicate matters, the full quote reveals a dimension that's a=

bit less cozy, and one suspects that this goes to the root of, say,
Duncan's contretemps with Levertov:

"I make poetry as other men make war or make love or make states or
revolutions: to exercise my faculties at large=2E"

In a rush today, so I'll just throw that out for others' comment=2E

Hilton and Aldon,
it was good to hear from both of you.
and you've both, in different ways, opened my eyes
a little wider, mostly about Rudd's seeming inaction,
or non-response to questions about Iraq, etc..  i went to
that event thinking he'd impart some wise counterpoint
for the scattered song of the Left.

but anyway.  and yes, i wanted to agree that it has
been clear that the FBI did what they did in the good
old days with no Patriot Act, but, don't you agree, that
those very actions --found illegal over and over-- are
in fact the reasons so many of the Weather Underground
are free today?  we may also have Watergate, and the
years to follow of the soft-browed Jimmy Carter to also
thank for the freedoms they have today.

but the Patriot Act delivers Daddy with no strings attached.

maybe Rudd's optimism shouldn't be so easily dismissed though.
when talking to an old friend recently about the Rudd event,
she reminded me that Michael Moore said, when visiting
Philadelphia a year ago, "Those of us who want a saner,
more equal and compassionate America are NOT the minority.
Don't let the big noise of the Right fool you."

by the way,
one of the reasons that i've had so much respect for
Rudd and his comrades, is their belief that including working
class people in the struggle was a must.

class issues are something i find particularly fascinating in
all this business of the Left.  it's interesting that friends of
mine who are much older, in their mid to late 50's, who are
STILL activists after all these years, come from working
class families.  my friend Mary Kalyna and i talk about this
almost every time we get together.  we both come from
factory working parents, and she, a good 15 years older,
tells me that most of the women left in the Left (and she
doesn't mean those who have become cheerleaders for
the sidelines, but those who are still digging the trenches)
who are her age, also come from working class backgrounds.
this makes me think of Bell Hooks, who has written and
spoken very often of the privileged white youth who take
a stand, become activists fighting racism, sexism, etc.,
but then retire to the comfort of their class as they age.
my friend Tamara Hopson, 55, not only didn't come from
middle class parents, but came from very hungry, very
poor, very much less than working class parents.  and she
is now a leader in forging new political action for gender
activists all across the country.  of course i'm generalizing,
i understand that.  but it's still interesting, when you take
someone who has no cushion to fall back on, and they
join a movement, that that force of that movement becomes
a power much more familiar than traditional family, and links
the vision for a better world for everyone to a new sense of Self.
i must admit, i love my friends as family because of this.

Dawson's Book Shop is pleased to welcome author Ian Monk for a special
reading from his new book Family Archaeology and Other Poems, published
by Make Now Press. Monk is a member of the Ouvroir de Litt=E9rature
Potentielle, (OULIPO), a group, based in France, devoted to the
exploring the possibilities of restrictive writing methods; all the
poems in Monk's book have been generated from a challenging formal
constraint.

"Once upon a time there was a potential literature; now, thankfully,
it's been realized. Ian Monk's concrete language hits you like a ton of
bricks. As visual as it is verbal, Monk's quantification of the
contemporary churns the mundane into the exotic," - Kenneth Goldsmith

Joseph Thomas of CSUN (who read wonderfully at B&N Glendale a few weeks
ago!) and Kenneth Goldsmith (aka Kenny G) will also read.

Subject:      A Moment Of Bern Porter You Might Have Missed If You Didn't
              Realize....
MIME-Version: 1.0

looking over an old journal from the late 90's, when i was
roommates with Sheila Holtz, who eventually moved to
Maine to edit Bern Porter International, i came across
the following entry, something i had forgotten about:

-------------
bomb-making
avant garde poet/artist Bern Porter
appeared as an extra in the 1996
film adaptation to Stephen King's
novel THINNER (starring no one that
i can ever recall seeing before, although
Stephen King himself plays a nervous
--and sexy, since he can't help himself--
nerdy pharmacist)

about 48 and one half minutes into
the film when we enter the dream
sequence of the Gypsy Carnival,
Bern Porter and Sheila Holtz are
visible for about 1 and one half
seconds while standing in the
audience before the 106-year-old
Gypsy King named Lemke.  for the
first half of the 1 and one half seconds
we see them from behind, as a gypsy
is picking Sheila's pocket.  Sheila is
then smiling and laughing when the
rest of the 1 and one half seconds
shows them from the front.  they really
should have given Bern a speaking role.
-------------
from dream sequence to dream,

Tom Cruise Never Sucked My Cock
(A Fantasy)



That's not the way it went down.
I performed oral sex on him
in the bathroom on the set of my movie "The Cockpit Club".
We met through a mutual friend

I performed oral sex on Tom Cruise
And getting him off was a mission impossible.
We met at a party Rebecca Demornay was throwing.
He was standing in her living room drinking white champagne.

Getting him off was a mission impossible
As his cock flossed my teeth.
He looked good as shit standing in Rebecca's living room, lips sipping=20
champagne.
He noticed me smiling at him over Cuba Gooding Jr's shoulder.

His cock flossed my teeth
And I didn't care about the whereabouts of Nicole.
He saw me smiling at him as I was talking to Cuba Gooding Jr.
Who is actually taller in person.

I think Nicole was in the other room
Talking to Julianne Moore
Who is also very tall in person.
He's nothing like the characters he play in his movies.

Nicole was out on the deck talking to Julianne Moore I think.
Tom smelled sweeter than a cosmetics counter in his Armani suit
And he's nothing like the characters he play in his movies.
He slipped me a phone number the rest of the world doesn't know about

smelling like a cosmetics counter.
He was growing a beard; I wanted to touch him
While he slipped his confidential number in my shirt pocket.
He kissed me in the toilet, on the set of my new movie, "The Cockpit =
Club."





Scott and John Plan to Blow Up the Jenny Jones Show



"Come to me.
"I have the tool for you'm" he wrote
in a note convened on a coffee table

in a newly furnished trailer.
John grinds his teeth.
Face shade to an angry red behind

made up smiles
Scott goes for a hug,
John pulls away.

The audience cheer.
Women think it's sweet.
John remains intact.

He keeps it together under fluorescent lights,
in front of 90 million nosey eyes.
Before the lights flickered,

before the cameras rolled
& murder took place,
John and Scott have a few drinks on hotel tab.

They go to dinner on Jenny's platinum card.
Take that bitch's BMW for a moonlit stroll down
the highways and byways of Chicago.

"I'm straight and into girls."
he says, as he breaks into Scott's home
loading three bullets into his chest.

Smoke levitating from the wounds like ghosts.
Scott pulls himself to the cordless telephone.
He coughs up blood.

Scott calls his mother.
She holds her dead son in her arms.

Her nightmares are like movies that never end.
She wants to wake up to him cooking bacon and eggs.
Kiss him off to school.

John drops his gun in a nearby dumpster.
He watches Wheel of Fortune until the cops arrive.
Feeds dog, calls sick grandmother

before the handcuffs,
before the interrogations,
before a legal pad confession.

"I'm going away for a while grandma," he yells.
She's deaf in one ear.
John could never hurt a fly.

His mother mortgages her house
for expensive lawyers.
Pawns coin collection for bail.

John is a good boy.
John is a good, clean All- American boy
who takes out the trash

and eats his vegetables.
John is sentenced to life in prison
without the possibility of parole.

Realize....
looking over an old journal from the late 90's, when i was
roommates with Sheila Holtz, who eventually moved to
Maine to edit Bern Porter International, i came across
the following entry, something i had forgotten about:

-------------
bomb-making
avant garde poet/artist Bern Porter
appeared as an extra in the 1996
film adaptation to Stephen King's
novel THINNER (starring no one that
i can ever recall seeing before, although
Stephen King himself plays a nervous
--and sexy, since he can't help himself--
nerdy pharmacist)

about 48 and one half minutes into
the film when we enter the dream
sequence of the Gypsy Carnival,
Bern Porter and Sheila Holtz are
visible for about 1 and one half
seconds while standing in the
audience before the 106-year-old
Gypsy King named Lemke.  for the
first half of the 1 and one half seconds
we see them from behind, as a gypsy
is picking Sheila's pocket.  Sheila is
then smiling and laughing when the
rest of the 1 and one half seconds
shows them from the front.  they really
should have given Bern a speaking role.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Steve -- Is your computer or server running a day late or something -- your
posts always come in showing a day late on the clock -- which doesn't really
matter except that those of us who have or email sorted by date some times miss
your posts at first because they're sorted down in among the posts we've

Wasington Ave to Oberlin, Oberlin to Brownell

Beads of light under brick cinderblock
boxes throttle vampire awnings.

Neon squeezes out of Biggy's
in those pants you sweat, black legs
aching over cruelties of pavement.

Just step past the weeds.

It's sun keeps me in cracks. Trace some
long cold sidewalk through sudden
bolts of flower odor, rotating fast.

As in lying shorn on this chained field.

Daniel Elsberg commented that most of the things that were done to him
during Watergate and were considered illegal then would be legal under the
Patriot Act.  Government repression is a given -- whether COINTELPRO or
Sacco and Vanzetti or the Palmer Raids or the Haymarket Trial or . . . --
but I don't want to play down the Patriot Act: it is perhaps the most
serious attempt to give legal cover to police-state tactics in the history
of the US.

Most -- but not all -- Weather underground activists came from middle-class
or even privileged backgrounds.  Also, the theory of white privilege they
advocated -- that most white workers have been bribed by the privilege of
racism and the great profits enjoyed by imperialism to side with the ruling
class and that black and other non-white peoples are the core of the
revolutionary movement with Third World peoples fighting for national
liberation -- made them targets of criticism for being anti-working class
by more traditionally Marxist oriented groups.

I was at Columbia in 1968, and very politically active, tho not Weatherman
or SDS. I must have gone to 500 rallies. Mark Rudd became a spokesperson
because he was photogenic and demanded the attention, to the vocal
annoyance of a lot of his compatriots. He was given to spontaneous oratory
that was big on provocation but short on coherence. He seemed increasingly
trapped by a celibrity whose consequences he hadn't anticipated.

The numbers occupying buildings were relatively small, the numbers
supporting them (or rather, some of their positions) and opposing the use
of police force, were enormous. Those in the buildings were unharmed; there
were several hundred injured outside the buildings, myself included
(fortunately, not badly).

About a week after the buildings were evacuated, some of the (what shall I
call them) alumni of the occupation, many of whom had decided to continue
living in a confined space together, issued a command that the then empty
ground on campus between 118th and 119th Street be made into a cooperative
farm to be worked by the peasants from the surrounding slums.

At the various huge (300,000+ in attendance) antiwar rallies the Weathermen
were a disruptive element, endangering everyone around them. There was a
strong feeling by almost everyone else (I didn't take a poll, but there's
ample documentation) that the disruptions were
counterproductive--demonstrations are about publicity, and the violence
drew the media, crowding out everything else. It also helped harden the
divisions in the culture that made it possible to sustain support for the war.

Mark and All,

Well, now we can get into an old-timer's debate.

SDS at Columbia was not Weatherman.  Most of the people in the buildings
were not SDS activists but were sympathetic students and people off campus,
like The Motherfuckers from the Lower East Side.  Rudd was very much a
leader at that time, regarded at least by people occupying the President's
office in Low Library where I was as subject to our participatory
democracy, but he was not THE leader or regarded as charismatic.  He was
considered an ordinary schmuck -- and that was endearing, since he wasn't
much different than the rest of us.  People often told him what to do
("Let's tear down the fence!") and he was forced to do it.  It was AFTER
the Columbia rebellion that he became "trapped by celebrity" and the
conflicts in SDS accelerated.  Far more articulate were Dave Gilbert and
Paul Rockwell who would speak at length explaining the inner workings of
the government, CIA ties to the university (evidence for which we found in
the President's office), and more.  Gilbert is in jail for life for the
Brink's robbery, and Rockwell is somewhere in the California Central Valley
working on community and labor coalitions.

By all the news footage there's no doubt that people outside the buildings
were severely injured.  There's no footage of what happened inside the
buildings, however.  Black students in Hamilton Hall negotiated a surrender
-- and they were uninjured (and consequently Harlem did not explode in rage
and the university did not burn to the ground, as feared by city and
university authorities).  Perhaps some people inside the buildings thought
it was a lark -- David Shapiro's photo with his feet up on President Kirk's
desk smoking his cigars became emblematic, even though he left immediately
afterwards (yet that photo has come to haunt him his entire life) -- but
people in Low, who were surrounded by right wing students, a line of
faculty trying to keep peace, and various pro and con demonstrations
outside, took the occupation very seriously, argued every point of
negotiations and strategy.

When the police finally did attack, people in the other buildings reported
severe beatings, being dragged by their feet down steps for flights, and
more.  In Low Library, once police broke through barricades and surrounded
the 135 or so people circled together, arms linked in passive resistance,
they began systematically beating people -- nobody escaped injury.  I
vividly remember one cop swaggering over to a girl and casually lift his
extended utility flashlight and begin pounding her over her head
relentlessly, then came my turn.  The police then went ahead and trashed
the place, depicting walls smeared with paint and other garbage as the
doing of the students and supporters.  Reading the NY Times the next day
raging at the barbarism of the students was one of the deepest learning
experiences I have had about the manipulations of the media and the ruling
class.  I know the truth; I was there; they lie.

Mark, I don't know about the cooperative farm riff -- never heard of that
before -- except that this was the time that "guerilla theater" and other
humorous modes of resistance began to blossom, and it sounds like a great
goofy joke.  This was the time when, during the strike following the
occupation, "the liberated university" flourished, and all sorts of
incredible ideas were projected and classes were held that are today part
of the regular curriculum of universities (e.g., the history of racism,
imperialism and literature, avant-guard poetry).  I know I worked with
others during this period organizing poetry readings with Allen Ginsberg,
The Grateful Dead filling up the entire campus with their sound, and
Village drag queens offering campy support (this is a year before Stonewall).

I do know that, about 20 days after the initial occupation ended, students
barricaded the campus and re-occupied Hamilton Hall.  Police moved through
the barricades, and I saw thousands of enraged students charge into police,
even beating them back, while police chased after them, guns drawn and duct
tape over their badge numbers, beating them relentlessly.  The level of
violence escalated soon after that: guns drawn would be used thereafter, as
Kent and Jackson States demonstrated.

In any case, many of the people involved in Columbia SDS did become
involved in Weatherman -- but don't conflate the two.  Events and politics
changed so quickly during that time that it would seem easy to simply see
everything in a static fashion.

Calacalandia mourns the loss of poet activist Phil Goldvarg


Yesterday we received a phone call from Helen Quintana, Phil Goldvarg's
wife, notifying us that he had passed away earlier that day. Phil had been
battling brain cancer since he was diagnosed while in San Diego for Chicano
Park Day in 2003.

Phil is known by many as a humble caring human being who always strived for
a more just society. But that humbleness did not stop him from taking on
many issues in his prolific poems: from police brutality and genocide to
Vieques and Chiapas and beyond. Phil's "lengua de filero" was always
willing
to throw down a poem or two for the right cause including many pieces on
Chicano Park.

Phil has always been a supporter of Calaca Press. From our first book Bus
Stops and Other Poems in 1998 to our last conversation a month or so
ago. He
has been there since the beginning. Whenever in San Diego he made an effort
to contact us. If he couldn't see us in person he would call. That was the
type of person Phil was.

On behalf of Calaca Press, the Red CalacArts Collective, and all of the
activists, writers and artists in Calacalandia we would like to express our
deepest sympathies to Helen and all of Phil's family and friends.


With love and sadness,

Brent E. Beltrán
Consuelo Manríquez de Beltrán
Calaca Press/Red CalacArts Collective


p.s. Below is an email with contact info for those who wish to send Helen
your condolences.

p.p.s. We may have lost a great human being but he left us his poems to
keep
us company. Below are two pieces dedicated to the recently departed Gloria
Anzaldua and Pedro Pietri. The third is a piece called Does Anyone Know Who
We're Bombing Today?

Does Anyone Know Who We're Bombing Today


does anyone know who we're bombing today,
      evidence is gone with melted flesh,
            bones turned to dust,
villages disappeared,
      cries of pain lost in clouded explosions,
            generations flow faded to crumbled hope,
does anyone know we fill nights' sky,
      targeting the untargetable,
            did any of us get to vote on this homicide,
are we the shadow of violence,
      slipping into dark corners, scalpel in hand,
            choosing victims for the cut of death,
are we the locust that consumes human fields,
      does our hunger covet this earth,
            does anyone know what's going on,
we are armed and ready,
      stealth is a dance we know so well,
            under cover of flag we are genociders,
media puppets are fed on schedule,
      they throw up a killers meal,
            masked to hide the stench of annihilation,
does anyone know who we're bombing today,
      who we bombed yesterday,
            who we have in mind for tomorrow,
what do the killers tell their grandchildren,
      do they give them toy guns with live ammunition,
            hide them in lead lined shelters,
explain to them why they have no playmates,
      why air is poison,
            why windows are plastered with secrets,
ghost committees of oil drinkers,
      munition makers,
            earth thieves,
meet behind our troubled eyes,
      we don't realize a need
            for vision of discovery,
to question unknown moves of elected liars,
      walking blind in patriotic mist,
            over mass graves covered with plastic flowers,
does anyone know who we're bombing today,
      do we accept there is danger of our execution,
            do we let this deceptive shade fall across our heart,
does any one know extinction will be our gift,
      chain reaction of false leaders hate,
            their quest for power and elusive crowns,
what do we tell our grandchildren,
      what do we say when they ask for toy guns
            and live ammunition,

Mark:

I was at Berkeley at the time. I agree with you about disruption, but not
about the war, which was propelled by forces over which citizens had no
control. Just like when we tried to stop the invasion of Iraq. Nothing we
did or didn't do would have stopped these people. Nixon was only stopped by
his own mental illness, as Bush will be by his hypocritical beliefs.
 But the spirit of the 60s changed my life forever, and I think that of many
people. And the movements--Civil Rights, Women, Environment, continue to
this day, which is why the right-wing still hates the 60s. We saw in the
run-up to the invasion of Iraq that that spirit is still alive, in fact has
spread around the world. The spirit of the 60s, at Columbia, Berkeley, Kent
State, in Ann Arbor, Albuquerque, Chicago, and on dozens of other campus,
was the best this country had to give to the world.

As a relative youngen, I just want to thank everyone
who’s shared and recounted experiences in this thread.
Given what I detect as an increasing reaction against
the politicization of the humanities, it’s important
to remember the events and movements which
precipitated the things many in my generation take for
granted.

Props to the old-timers.

Seriously, thank you.

The problem is there shouldn't be old-timers; it's not a long recounting
of what someone did or didn't do - it's the need for constant vigilence.
There was a moment 'then' when it seemed that the left - or whatever -
could relax - but that just wasn't true; the right for example was
computerizing email lists and contacts vis-a-vis Billy Graham, and the
left was Stewart Brand. Nothing has changed except that technology has
served the right, in terms of infinite invasion, and infinite invasion of
privacy, perfect - to the extent that technology combines the garnering of
resources and control, it/automation mimics the corporate entity itself;
there's not much difference between capital and gigabyte speed - if one's
so lucky.

It's like that saying which infuriates me - 'our children are our future'
- well, we're our fucking future, period, and we're sliding into fascism
at an unnerving rate.

- Alan

Reviews of books I like and more -


Paul Graham, Hackers & Painters, Big Ideas from the Computer Age,
O'Reilly, 2004

This is a rather frustrating book, because there is a great deal of
information buried in a fairly flat landscape. I'm not sure why it wasn't
edited down to a more concise format. The author talks a great deal about
programming, languages, and sites such as Orbitz which is written in lisp.
The chapters that fascinated me most are near the end: Programming
Languages Explained, The Hundred-Year Language, Revenge of the Nerds, and
The Dream Language. The author extols hackers and user-friendly
languages, and has made me want to learn lisp; he writes extensively on
its advantages. I like lines like "There are worse things than having
people misunderstand your work. A worse danger is that you will yourself
misunderstand your work." On the other hand, there are far too few
examples - parts of the book might be already too simple for programmers,
but parts are also too simple for humanities-based theory. I'd recommend
this book to anyone interested in thinking about the issues raised, but
not expecting too many answers.

The Works of Mencius, translated etc. James Legge, Dover edition.

I'm on a slow-reading email list for Mencius - the book is terrific, even
after millennia have passed. I had expected a much drier text - it's not
at all. A tremendous guide to early Chinese culture as well.

Georges Ifrah, The Universal History of Numbers, Harvill, three volumes
(paperback).

If you read anything in the philosophy of mathematics - or philosophy for
that matter - or the history/phenomenology of symbols - or the
historiography (not to mention history) - of computers, you should run out
the door and buy these. They're critical. First volume, early history;
second volume, modern number-system, third volume, computer and the
information revolution. On top of everything else, they're exciting to
read.

George Dunnington, History and Progress of the County of Marion, West
Virginia, 1992 reprint of 1880.

I've become fascinated by the history of West Virginia - ranging from
Native Americans through the mines and mine war. Fairmont in Marion was
the home of Israel Forman, who made the cabinet cards I have in my current
exhibition here (around 1889). Now it turns out that a fire which
destroyed the downtown in 1876, just around the time of the Centennial,
was discovered "burning up the stairs leading to Foreman's (sic)
photograph gallery" and that it was most likely deliberately set. The plot
thickens but nothing remains, not even of Main Street, which seems to have
disappeared altogether from the town, probably through renaming.

Stefan George, Der Teppich des Lebens und die Lieder von Traum und Tod mit
einem Vorspiel, Georg Bondi, Berlin, 1915 - probably first published 1904.

I just purchased this for $8 at a used bookstore - what fascinates me is
the early sans serif type - the outside is typical art nouveau, as is the
title page - but the poems themselves are set in another style altogether.
Anyone know the history of sans serif?

Robert Karl Reischauer, Early Japanese History, 1969 reprint from 1937,
only Part A,

and no, this isn't _the_ Reischauer, but a brilliant book documenting the
subject year by year, as in chronicle form (gathered from a great number
of sources), as well as an outline, diagrams, and tables - if you're
interested in this subject, I think this work would be indispensible - you
can get both volumes on abe for as little as $40. Even if you're not
interested in the subject, these are amazing reading.

Volney's Ruins, or Meditation on the Revolutions of Empires, translated
under the immediate inspection of the author from the sixth Paris edition,
to which is added, The Law of Nature, and A Short Biographical Notice, by
Count Daru: also, The Controversy between Dr. Priestly and Volney, Boston,
1835.

Has anyone read all of Volney? I'm fascinated by this work, which I'm
dipping into - I'm sure it's been republished - it's available all over
the Net - influenced the Shelleys - he knew Washington - hysteric
romanticisms, orientalisms, fantastic accounts, dialogs, everything -

Alan Sondheim, recent work,

has involved motion capture bvh files created for Poser; background is
supplied by images from Cooper's Rock and Gentile Glass company. The
result is the dismembered high-speed post-modern body as the contacts are
remapped onto bodies plural, as well as floor-heaps and straight-forward
topological splits/joins, etc. The background of the recent pieces
attempts to impose a narratology, if not a narrative, upon the results.
Other work has involved the creation of a filtering program for ascii
texts (with the aid of two c++ programmers) which will use mathematical
functions as its basis.

A few words about
the book:

Along the lines of
Robert Bly in his
Morning Poems or
David Lehman in
The Daily Mirror,
Wanda Phipps
embarked upon a
poem-a-day project.
Over
the course of
several months,
Phipps composed a
poem each morning
after
she awoke — Wake-Up
Calls collects the
best from this daily
experiment.
She investigates the
hypnogogic state,
that weird and
wonderful place
that holds bits of
dreams of the night
before, recent and
not so recent
memories, and subtle
visions for the
future. In many, she
wakes feeling
fresh-faced and
dreamy, in others
her voice rings raw
and sexy, cranky
or disappointed,
confused or amused.
Like much of her
work they deal
with desire,
sensation, female
energy, and the
visceral nature of
language. Poetic
influences including
Ezra Pound, Emily
Dickinson, and
Robert Creeley may
be traced here, and
are complemented by
appearances
of pop-culture
figures such as
Sigourney Weaver,
Ann Margaret, and
the
Velvet Underground.
Phipps' work
emanates a sincerity
and directness
that is all too rare
in our current age
of irony.

"How pleasant to be
let in on a young
woman's mornings as
she leaves
behind the night and
finds her way into a
new day! Sometimes
she's still
full of dreams
and/or vodka or some
mysterious honeycomb
leaving behind
its sweetness as it
flees, and sometimes
she's
preternaturally
lucid and
filled with resolve.
The days stretch
before her hopeful
and intriguing
and fetchingly
unknown. Wanda
Phipps' poems
restored the world
briefly
into the unbearable
longing and clarity
of youth, and this
old grump
wept. Very tonic,
very lovely, poetry,
definitely."

--Andrei Codrescu,
author of "it was
today: new poems"


"Wanda Phipps' new
book gracefully
navigates an
expedition through
interrupted dreams,
soft-focus
adventures and the
rush hour that often

occurs between four
walls. Slightly
hazy, sometimes
hormonal, these
poems entice the
reader into
imagining what's
really going
on---between
the lines. A truly
beautiful and
inspiring work."

-- Gillian McCain,
co-author of "Please
Kill Me: The
Uncensored Oral
History of Punk"

thanks for asking it's so humid here in the city i'm probably always a
day late or behind 2 early bergman films today were really interesting...
i read w/tom savage bill kushner and merry fortune at nuyorican poets
cafe of all places  weds 23rd june 7pm merry's new book on future poems
press is beyond good   oh to answer your question seriously A tho i'd
rather do such things backchanneling a new word i learned since being on
this list  alot of the e's i  post on this list and in general are done
just before tho in most cases after midnite between 1-3am so that's
probably why whatever you said seems to ocurr ocurrs with 2 c's perhaps i
think  anyway the world has become so evil a flower tried to smell me
today
even if i get nothing out of it i want to see the sun/set again
we thought/we knew what we thought/for example/ the way the ballet moves\
while it re/mains/constant/we
thought
again              then/                     we
                                    forgot


folk songs   ( after bergman's 3 strange loves )

let's have a drink
i feel so much like a
machine
yet i can't keep
silent
the future worries me
i'm beginning to understand
ruins
they kill so much of my own
flesh &
blood
perhaps i am to
blame
this large dark mirror
betrays our
awkwardness
this rickety piano
betrays our
steps
this is a weird time for flashbacks
i'll never learn to sing
like the poor folks
sing


( those poor folks all around us who live in complete darkness..... )

Your last true enough, and things get conflated in memory.

The kids who wanted to form the coop were serious. It was the crowd who had
occupied I think it was Fayerweather.

Before the police got to you they beat up me and a lot of other people
trying to hold the line outside Low. They were mostly in plain clothes, no
badges, and swung blackjacks, which are both very painful and very illegal.
The day before we had held off the right wing students. It was a very long
week.

I wasn't hospitalized, but most of those who were were outside the buildings.

You've probably forgotten a demonstration by faculty on the steps of the
chapel that ended in a hail of nightsticks.

But hell, there was more than enough violence to go around.

The rebellion didn't end with the emptying of the buildings, it lasted
until at least 1970. I was in fact talking about Rudd's public persona,
which was largely after the occupations until summer. Most of the real
accomplishments--all temporary, alas--were made possible by the chaos
caused by the occupations but were carefully and quietly strategized
afterwards. For the duration of the war, for instance, classified research
was banned from the university. The same researchers simply continued under
other aegises, but at least the house was cleaner for a while. And very
very quietly, never admitting it had done so, the university admitted most
of the graduates (there were in fact very few) from the four abysmal
neighborhood high schools. Serious remedial and psychological help, and
full scholarships with room and board, were provided, and all teachers
involved with any of the kids met monthly under one of the deans to
coordinate progress, student by student. A few of those kids were in my
classes, and I was at the meetings. We also had an academic senate, with
strong student representation and real power--that's how we got rid of
classified research--and it was a dandy, noisy, and well-publicized forum.
I don't know when or if that ended, but it was in place for at least most
of the seventies.

Pardon my fuzziness--these aren't memories that I rehearse very often.

The demonstrations made it much harder to fight wars for the generation
that followed.

On the east coast, where hordes of us were streaming to Washington every
weekend, and the civil rights movement was being fought out at lunch
counters and on buses, the "spirit of the 60s" didn't seem nearly so much a
matter of universities. The feminist movement also didn't start in the schools.

While we're at it, we should remember that a lot of the struggle was in
Europe and Latin America. While we were demonstrating in the relative
comfort of US universities French workers were marching in the streets with
students and the Mexican army was gunning down over 600 at Tlatelalco.

Sometimes I think I am a radio. I sit 12 or so feet away from a radio which
is on, tuned to a local FM station. The sound turns fuzzy, distorted, the
music's all messed up so I make to get up and adjust. As soon as I stand the
sound is perfectly clear. So I sit down again. And as soon as I am reseated
the distortion returns. I seem to detune the tuning. So, if I am a radio I
am a fucked up radio I guess. Signal disrupted.

LATEST BOYCOTT NEWS

Brochures calling for the boycott of BUSINESSES WHICH SUPPORT ISRAEL
were given to 50 people at Mosque of Muslim Brotherhood [New York City]
which is African-American.
Boycott brochures was also given to 50 people at Al-Madinah Masjid,
western Baltimore, run by Nigerians but attended by Indo-Pakistanis.
A number of brothers and sisters at Masjid Jamaat al-Muslimeen
[Baltimore] have taken extra copies to distribute to Muslims who do not
come to mosques. One sister at Masjid al-Rahma [Baltimore], very
enthusiastic, exclaimed that her friends were in a state of shock to see
that STARBUCKS supports Israel.

was from Shklovsky's -Third Factory- but cant find there. Anyone know where
it's from? She needs exact page and edition info. Thanks, and here it is:

"It is not our job to renovate ideological institutions on the basis of the

Go indigenous in a small country
Color wit, fathom who=B9s crime
Run the eye over the morning scalp
Champion the elevation of heart
Put brains to the desperate
Those who have built a house of cards
Watch them breathe guile & treachery
Threat & terror: wing the morning cup,
Speak truth to clarity, word by word,
Image by image, open-eyed & open-mouthed
Foot by foot into the gathering storm
The cards are falling like bullets
Note the Vice President=B9s eyes
Hysteria is a wanton, unwanted character...

As always, your feedback appreciated.

I hate to site books in the face of personal testimony, but one particular
book (Lies My History Teacher Told Me) argues through statistics that the
last places to be affected by the anti-war movement was the Universities. In
fact, the statistics showed that at the end of the Vietnam war, the only
part of society that still supported the war in a significant manner were
University students. The thesis being that the perseption of a "student" led
and fed movement was a myth.

From personal experience, I would say that the same could be said for my
limited experience with the pre-Iraq part 2 demos.

University students (myself once included) are often troubled with the
burden of privilege and do not dare risk their status. That was a joke.

Are you not exploring different computer codes to define a sense of reality.
For example, what is your interest in "lisp"? When you refer to a chapter like
"The Dream Language," in a book (Hackers & Painters, Big Ideas from the
Computer Age) which obviously makes connections between computer codes and meta
(outside) computer language, are you not implying the same connection yourself?

At least yours is an obsession, but isn't obsession a kind of love?

    reading held in honor of Canada's Talonbooks at the American =
    Contemporary Artists Galleries (ACA) in the heart of Chelsea. =
    Established in 1932, the ACA specializes in 20th-Century American and =
    contemporary art. On the first Thursday of every month, it holds a =
    poetry reading series-hosted by Dave Kirschenbaum, Publisher and Editor =
    of Boog Literature-which spotlights and honors literary press publishers =
    from outside of New York City. The first Thursday of July this year =
    falls on July 1, Canada Day, and the ACA will be honoring =
    Talonbooks-only the second Canadian literary press to be invited-with a =
    gala poetry reading from 6:00 pm-8:00 pm. For more information on the =
    ACA Galleries (located at 529 West 20th St., Fifth Floor) please visit =
    their web-site: http://www.acagalleries.com/home.htm

    Talonbooks is one of Canada's leading literary presses. Since its =
    inception over 40 years ago, it has become Canada's foremost publisher =
    of drama and French translation titles, as well as one of the nation's =
    most important publishers of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction. Its =
    authors and their books have received numerous awards, including the =
    prestigious Canada Governor General's Literary Awards, BC Book Prizes, =
    and other national and international literary honors. This event will =
    spearhead Talon's launch of three new poetry collections from the =
    critically acclaimed authors bill bissett, Adeena Karasick, and Jamie =
    Reid. For more information on Talonbooks please visit www.talonbooks.com

    narrativ enigma / rumours uv hurricane by bill bissett (0-88922-507-9; 6 =
    x 9; 144 pp; $17.95 CN / $13.95 US) This is the newest book from one of =
    Canada's best known and celebrated poets and artists. bill bissett is =
    the author of over 20 books (8 with Talonbooks) and is well known for =
    his ability to capture and mesmerize his audience with playful, =
    energetic, and powerful readings. His most recent book, peter among the =
    towring boxes / text bites (0-88922-464-1), won a BC Book Prize for best =
    poetry in 2003, an award which he had won ten years earlier for =
    inkorrect thoughts in 1993. bissett is also the inaugural recipient of =
    the Milton Acorn People's Poet Award.

    The House That Hijack Built by Adeena Karasick (0-88922-511-7; 6 x 9; =
    128 pp; $19.95 CN / $15.95 US)
    This is another of Adeena Karasick's electrifying and visually stunning =
    works of collage and poetry that has made her one of Talonbooks's most =
    critically acclaimed poets. Her writing has generated great =
    international interest and has been hailed as "an impressive =
    deconstruction of language and meaning" that is "exuberant in [its] =
    cross-fertilization of punning and knowing, theatre and theory." =
    Karasick's M=EAmewars was a finalist for a BC Book Prize in 1996, and =
    she won the Bumbershoot Book Prize for Dyssemia Sleaze in 2000. More =
    information on Karasick and her work can be found at =
    www.adeenakarasick.com

    I, Another. The Space Between: Selected Poems by Jamie Reid =
    (0-88922-512-5; 6 x 9; 192 pp; $17.95 CN / $13.95 US) This is the long =
    awaited new volume of poetry from Jamie Reid, a key figure in the =
    Canadian avant-garde poetry movement in the 1960s. The publication of =
    his first book, The Man Whose Path Was on Fire, in 1967 took the =
    Canadian poetry circle by storm. Reid then took a 20-year hiatus from =
    writing poetry, despite this enormous critical success. He finally =
    returned to the literary scene as the editor of the well respected =
    journal DaDaBaBy and has since authored many other works. This is his =
    first book of collected poems.=20

Yes and no for all of this. My interest in lisp was triggered by the
Hackers & Painters book, but I'm not a programmer. And yes, I'm exploring
codes - but more often than not, taking applications (such as the recent
motion capture materials) to their limit, not as a jest, but in order to
establish and examine border phenomena, for example, the shuddered body,
that results at that point. Or its depiction thereof.

The obsession might be more with working in general; I have to practice
music (now tenor guitar/shakuhachi) daily, read theory daily, etc. etc. -
it's all obsessiveness. But at least for me obsession is crippling,
related to OCD, inescapable; the fact that I've harnessed it to some
extent is probably for the good - at least it enables me to proceed.

What I'm in love with in fact would be, besides certain people in my life
and our cat, certain things that have an aura for me - not the computer,
but perhaps the Zaurus PDA, the shakuhachi, tenor guitar, a 1949 di
Giorgio classical guitar I've played since the 60s, things like that. But
what excites me is still what Ellroy calls the wonder, as does Merleau-
Ponty in another context - the sheer excitement of discovery, the marvels
that surround us yet, in the midst of so much violence, slaughter, misery,
extinction, decay -

Amazing, the spirit of Walter Benjamin comes up again, aura. Do you think the
computer contains aura?

Do you think the medium of infinite repetition (to me that is what a computer
is) can produce aura?

How did the first medium of "mechanical reproduction," photography, develop
aura? Is it because it was not mechanical after all, subject to the whims,
chaotic freedom of the movement of light? Is there a similar limit (boundary) in
the computer -a light source in w.w.w.- beyond which it is free and gains aura?

Murat, what does whether your being right or not
about Alan's love for computers make what he was
originally saying right or not?  a knife can open an apple
or open somebody's belly, the knife not the issue,
but the desire behind the knife is.  food or vengeance.
i like what Alan said, and would like to hear more
from him about it, frankly.

Intelligence is the idiotic search for simplicity in
understanding, and as such an irresoluble and stupid
phenomenon. No matter the complexity of the steps
taken to arrive at an explanation, the isolated end
result will be nothing more (or less) than a
simplification of –or will to dominate—phenomenal
reality. Thus, the real value (the pleasure) of
thought is in its movement and is equivalent to the
very indeterminacy of its trajectory. This shouldn’t
be confused with a fetish for the new; for the stakes
are in the _ground_, the bleeding figure is small
potatoes.  What Benjamin meant when he said my method
is detour. How sad, however, to realize that the
unshackling of thinking from the logic of use-value
does nothing to liberate society from the cynical
machinations of use-lusting demagogues (perversion of
perversions). It is for this reason poets despair.
Only if everyone were a poet could poetry be properly
useless and humanity freed. However, to bring about a
world suffused with poets requires the very opposite
of conversion. It would require precisely nothing.
They will know we are poets by our poetry, which does
nothing. Each poem another drag on a cigarette; the
only cure, cancer. The mind sublimates, the body
lives, and how often does the body outlive the mind?
The situationists desolved poetry into being,
attempting to eradicate art—Debord’s intelligence
equivalent to his aestheticism and conservatism.
Cagier than Cage the situationists’ success was
immeasurable.

When someone says the value of an idea or theory
resides in its usefulness, in the ability to do things
with it, we should insist (rather than assume) that
the processes a thought avails are interesting ones.
Something else is bad faith.

The blind and deaf read and listen with hands crawling
over surfaces of difference to make meaning, the poet
hands over her eyes and ears, trembling. Laughing. No
one will take them.

That numb truth: receiving always hurts, every gift is
an imposition.

The populations can cry “Beat Me! Beat Us!” because
there is nothing softer than a bruise. It is called
Occam’s razor, not Occam’s bridge or Occam’s route. In
a sea of inconsistencies, ambiguities and redundancies

I am tired of Taiwan.

They are not for the politicians, who make the wars--although, judging from
the recent results of elections in Europe, they were a warning, and I hope,
come November, in this country too--but for the people who demonstrate. They
are a reaffirmation of the spirit, an airing of the good demons in us.

Gallery Owner Attacked for Iraq Abuse Art

May 29, 2004

By LISA LEFF, Associated Press Writer

SAN FRANCISCO - A San Francisco gallery owner bears a painful reminder
of
the nation's unresolved anguish over the incidents at the Abu Ghraib
prison
- a black eye delivered by an unknown assailant who apparently objected
to
a painting that depicts U.S. soldiers torturing Iraqi prisoners.

The assault outside the Capobianco gallery in the city's North Beach
district Thursday night was the worst in a string of verbal and physical
attacks directed at Lori Haigh since the artwork was installed at her
gallery on May 16.

San Francisco police are investigating and have stepped up patrols
around
the gallery. But Haigh decided to close the gallery indefinitely, citing
concern for the safety of her two children, ages 14 and 4, who often
accompanied her to work.

Guy Colwell's painting, titled "Abuse," depicts three U.S. soldiers
leering
at a group of naked men in hoods with wires connected to their bodies.
The
one in the foreground has a blood-spattered American flag patch on his
uniform. In the background, a soldier in sunglasses guards a blindfolded
woman.

The painting was part of a show of the Berkeley artist's work that
mostly
featured pastel-colored abstracts.

Colwell stopped by the gallery Friday, but refused to discuss his work
or
the reaction to it, saying only, "I'm sorry if this is putting pressure
on
Lori."

Two days after the painting went up in a front window, someone threw
eggs
and dumped trash on the doorstep. Haigh said she did not think to
connect
it to the events at Baghdad's notorious prison until people started
leaving
nasty messages and threats on her business answering machine.

"I think you need to get your gallery out of this neighborhood before
you
get hurt," one caller said.

She removed the painting from the window, but the gallery's troubles
received news coverage and the criticism continued. The answering
machine
recorded new calls from people accusing her of being a coward for moving
the artwork.

Last weekend, Haigh said a man walked into the gallery, pretended to
scrutinize the painting for a moment, then marched up to her desk and
spat
in her face.

On Thursday, someone knocked on the door of the gallery, then punched
Haigh
in the face when she stepped outside.

"This isn't art-politics central here at all," Haigh said. "I'm not
here to
make a stand. I never set out to be a crusader or a political activist."

In closing the gallery, Haigh was forced to cancel an upcoming show
featuring counterculture artist Winston Smith.

For Haigh, who opened Capobianco a year and a half ago, having the
chance
to work with prominent artists fulfilled a lifelong dream.

"I kept thinking someday I'll have enough of a reputation where I could
bring in my heroes of the art world, people like Guy Colwell
especially,"
she said.

Haigh has received some expressions of support since closing the
gallery.
Her favorite: an e-mail whose writer said, "I'm sure that a few and
dangerous minds don't understand that they have only mimicked the same
perversity this painting had expressed."

This book, Beasts of Eden, of David Rains Wallace (below, reviewed in last
weeks NY Times  - which deals with a whole Paris 1795 literal underworld
discovery of Roman and Prehistoric animal remains - makes me want to ask on
what level or not did the consciousness of the 200 hundred miles of
underground caverns  ever impact either Baudelaire or Benjamin's writings on
Paris (clearly it got a hold of Balzac on some level).  But I am just
curious - out of my own limited knowledge of 19th century French writing -
the degree to which this pre-Medieval space may or may not have impacted the
conscious construction of Paris' imagination of itself. And if not, why not.
If not, it sounds like a missed opportunity to have brought in "the lower
Arcades" - so to speak. Poe would have had a field day with the "spooks."
And maybe - after all- the sense of an underworld of anonymous Roman ghosts
does inform Baudelaire's sense of Paris' twilight  - whether or not he is
conscious of it.  It's been awhile since I read the Arcades, but did
Benjamin make any connections between this Roman space and the evolution of
Paris as an urban space - and in what way?

I would be curious if anybody is much more informed than I am on this - (?)
- walking around, as I do, plumbing up the whatever ghosts in the short
history under this frontier town, San Francisco - albeit the Oholone
Indians, and Asian migrations going south occasionally buzz the ear! Any
direction will be appreciated.
Thanks,
Stephen Vincent

BEASTS OF EDEN
Walking Whales, Dawn Horses, and Other Enigmas of Mammal Evolution.

'Beasts of Eden': The Evolutionary War
By HELEN E. FISHER

Published: June 13, 2004

....
David Rains Wallace, a science writer with 15 books to his credit, offers no
original theories on mammalian evolution in ''Beasts of Eden.'' Instead, he
presents a thoroughly researched, richly detailed and lively book on the
''bone hunters'' who traversed the badlands of the world searching for the
fossils of mammals and on the vituperative intellectual battles that some of
these paleontologists waged with one another. And as these stories unfold,
one becomes familiar with the primary ideas and events in the rise of modern
evolutionary thinking.

Wallace begins his stories of the men who dug up the mammal fossils in an
unlikely place: beneath Paris. Here lie some 200 miles of caverns, quarries
that Roman miners dug centuries ago to collect gypsum, a sturdy snow-white
building material. With time these tunnels became a vast cemetery. In fact,
Montmartre got its name -- ''Martyr Hill'' -- because Romans tossed the
beheaded corpses of Christian missionaries into these grottoes. In 1795 a
young French anatomist, Georges Cuvier, working at the Musee d'Histoire
Naturelle, came to study some of these bones -- not those of the six million
people deposited here in the late 18th century, when Parisian cemeteries
became too crowded; not the bones of the early Christian martyrs; but the
bones of bears, rhinos, deer and other mammals living 50 million years ago.

As Balzac wrote of Cuvier: ''He digs. . . . And suddenly marble turns into
animals, dead things live anew, and lost worlds are unfolded before us!''
Working at one or another of his 11 desks, Cuvier came to see that the
fossil elephants exhumed from these caverns were different from their modern
counterparts. And he speculated that some sort of catastrophe must have
annihilated the ancient pachyderms. ''Cuvier saw a brilliant mammalian world
that had risen, Eden-like, from the ocean, but then had sunk again.''

‘ I’m not anti-digital. . .  In short I think digital

(download complete lecture/talk in which Albini
discusses analogue vs. digital recording, file
sharing, the music biz, etc, here:
http://www.electrical.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=2281)

Alan, I’m wondering if you print hard copies of your
work, computer archives, etc? This goes for others
too. Is it of concern that poetry/information/art that
is only documented in virtual form will likely be
unreadable and totally lost in the not-too-distant
future? I realize the technical shortcomings of
digital tech. are far more ‘pressing’ for audio
documents than for purely visual texts, but it just
occurred to me watching this lecture that the entire
oeuvre of various ‘net artists’ etc. likely has a
literal shelf-life of, what, 10 years, 20, 30 years
tops????

I suspect this issue is most (immediately) felt in the
realm of epistolary documentation . . . for those
without the coveted “edu” caboose on their virtual
nameplates, email accounts often come and go, melting
into postmodern thin air. Ron Silliman apparently gets
hundreds of personal emails a day – where does that
stuff go?





Curious.

All the best,

Andrew.

The computer's neutral - the border phenomena occur when something is
pushed to the limit and behaves against (human) expectations; with motion
capture, it's when the skein is broken in ways that aren't that easily
parseable -

No, but the residue does, at least for me - the residue isn't virtual, but
is protocol material in a sense.

Aura to a great extent is extra-curricular, what we bring to it -

Well, theoretically infinite, but practically not, and that's something -
technology varies widely from one machine, language, protocol, display,
etc., to another; some things are now permanently inaccessible. So a
computer as technology is highly susceptible to obssolesence; as a
theoretical machine of course it's not.

I'm not sure in any case that aura is a production.

More the chaos of chemicals, papers, etc. which are never uniform. And
photography is directly tied to traditional materiality. It was never
mechanical, but chemical, which enters quickly into chaotic regimes.

In any case, the aura in computer work is probably related to the aura one
might find in 'the world of the work,' vis-a-vis a theorist such as
Dufrenne.

That's a good question and exercises me too. Hoiking poetry onto technology
seems increasingly to suggest that what is being created is the poetic
equivalent of junk-food. Moreso, as the rate of change in computer
technology accelerates, so the minimum of 10 years that Andrew suggests is
soon likely to be the maximum. Poetry becomes just another aspect of
consumer culture (and outside academe not a very important one) that is
available to and practised by those with access to the latest gadgets ( I
hasten to add I'm not characterising Alan thus!)

Alan, I'm wondering if you print hard copies of your
work, computer archives, etc? This goes for others
too. Is it of concern that poetry/information/art that
is only documented in virtual form will likely be
unreadable and totally lost in the not-too-distant
future? I realize the technical shortcomings of
digital tech. are far more 'pressing' for audio
documents than for purely visual texts, but it just
occurred to me watching this lecture that the entire
oeuvre of various 'net artists' etc. likely has a
literal shelf-life of, what, 10 years, 20, 30 years
tops????

I suspect this issue is most (immediately) felt in the
realm of epistolary documentation . . . for those
without the coveted "edu" caboose on their virtual
nameplates, email accounts often come and go, melting
into postmodern thin air. Ron Silliman apparently gets
hundreds of personal emails a day - where does that
stuff go?





Curious.

All the best,

                 *******

And, for the longwinded version ---

On Canada Day, July 1, 2004 there will be a book launch and poetry
reading held in honor of Canada's Talonbooks at the American Contemporary
Artists Galleries (ACA) in the heart of Chelsea.
Established in 1932, the ACA specializes in 20th-Century American and
contemporary art. On the first Thursday of every month, it holds a
poetry reading series-hosted by Dave Kirschenbaum, Publisher and Editor
of Boog Literature-which spotlights and honors literary press publishers
from outside of New York City. The first Thursday of July this year
falls on July 1, Canada Day, and the ACA will be honoring Talonbooks -with a
gala poetry reading from 6:00 pm-8:00 pm.
For more information on the ACA Galleries (located at 529 West 20th St.,
Fifth Floor) please visit their web-site: http://www.acagalleries.com/home.htm

Talonbooks is one of Canada's leading literary presses. Since its inception
over 40 years ago, it has become Canada's foremost publisher of drama and
French translation titles, as well as one of the nation's most important publishers
of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction. Its authors and their books have
received numerous awards, including the prestigious Canada Governor General's
Literary Awards, BC Book Prizes, and other national and international literary
honors. This event will spearhead Talon's launch of three new poetry collections
from the critically acclaimed authors bill bissett, Adeena Karasick, and Jamie
Reid.
For more information on Talonbooks please visit www.talonbooks.com

narrativ enigma / rumours uv hurricane by bill bissett
(0-88922-507-9; 6 x 9; 144 pp; $17.95 CN / $13.95 US) This is the newest book
from one of Canada's best known and celebrated poets and artists. bill
bissett is the author of over 20 books (8 with Talonbooks) and is well known for his
ability to capture and mesmerize his audience with playful, energetic, and
powerful readings. His most recent book, peter among the towring boxes / text
bites (0-88922-464-1), won a BC Book Prize for best  poetry in 2003, an award
which he had won ten years earlier for inkorrect thoughts in 1993. bissett is
also the inaugural recipient of the Milton Acorn People's Poet Award.

The House That Hijack Built by Adeena Karasick
(0-88922-511-7;6 x 9; 128 pp; $19.95 CN / $15.95 US)
This is another of Adeena Karasick's electrifying and visually stunning works
of collage and poetry that has made her one of Talonbooks's most critically
acclaimed poets. Her writing has generated great international interest and has
been hailed as "an impressive deconstruction of language and meaning" that is
"exuberant in [its] cross-fertilization of punning and knowing, theatre and
theory." Karasick's Memewars was a finalist for a BC Booik Prize in 1996, and
she won the Bumbershoot Book Prize for Dyssemia Sleaze in 2000. More nformation
on Karasick and her work can be found at www.adeenakarasick.com

I, Another. The Space Between: Selected Poems by Jamie Reid
(0-88922-512-5; 6 x 9; 192 pp; $17.95 CN / $13.95 US). This is the long
awaited new volume of poetry from Jamie Reid, a key figure in the
Canadian avant-garde poetry movement in the 1960s. The publication of his
first book, The Man Whose Path Was on Fire, in 1967 took the Canadian poetry
circle by storm. Reid then took a 20-year hiatus from  writing poetry, despite
this enormous critical success. He finally returned to the literary scene as the
editor of the well respected journal DaDaBaBy and has since authored many
other works. This is his first book of collected poems.

This is a question that may go back to the beginnings of art. Did a
Paleolithic cave artist say, "Who will see my work in this pitch-black cave
a hundred years from now?" But he continued to paint, because he was an
artist.
 We work in the medium that we must, and maybe it will be read 30 years from
now, or maybe it won't be accessible. But that doesn't make it junk-food.
Perishable, maybe. Junk-food doesn't have to do with longevity but its lack
of nourishment.
There is a deceased British painter I read about recently whose major works
were destroyed in a warehouse fire. Would he have not painted had known this
would happen? He painted because he was an artist.
It's not the medium it's the meme, no matter in which medium one works.

Transgender History On The March

In a groundbreaking event, the transgender community of San Francisco
will proudly step forward by taking the first marching steps of San
Francisco Pride Weekend. An unprecedented Trans March is scheduled to
be held Friday evening, June 25. The broad and diverse spectrum of
transgendered people will be assembling at Dolores Park at 7:00 PM and
will begin their march to Civic Center at 8:00 PM. Upon their arrival,=20=

there

will be a ceremony inaugurating the 1st annual Transr Altar to honor,
chronicle, and celebrate the struggles, the sacrifices and the
accomplishments of our community.

The gathering at Civic Center will be addressed by State Assemblyman
Mark Leno, San Francisco Police Commissioner Theresa Sparks, and other
notable community members and friends. Marchers are being encouraged to

bring significant and meaningful objects, pictures and writings to be
placed on the altar to be displayed for the duration of Pride weekend.

=93What started off as a grass roots rally is turning into two =
historical

events=94, says community activist Cecilia Chung, =93We have no idea who
the original organizers were for the march but we are committed to
creating a safe event for our community. It=92s exciting to know that
there are others with the same vision and we are expecting a great=20
turnout. We
also want to thank San Francisco Pride for giving the financial support

as well as an opportunity to create our own venue for the transgender
community. All we need now is to spread the words, recruit volunteers,
and ask community members and allies to bring something personal to
help build the altar.=94

The Trans Altar is a project sponsored by San Francisco LGBT Pride
Celebration and will become a permanent art exhibit for future Pride
Celebrations here in San Francisco.

"The Pride Committee is excited to present the Trans Altar at our event

this year as a way to honor and celebrate the Transgender community in
all it's beauty and humanity. It provides Pride with a new, creative
way to fulfill our mission of mirroring the diversity and inclusivity
of the Celebration. The Altar, along with the Trans March, signals a new
level of visibility for the Transgender community and a new level of
growth for the LGBT community as a whole." says Joey Cain, current
President of San Francisco Pride.



Endorsers of the march include:

San Francisco LGBT Pride Celebration Committee
San Francisco LGBT Community Center
Remembering Our Dead Project
Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club
Youth Gender Project (YGP)
Transgender Law Center (TLC)
UCSF Transgender Resource and Neighborhood Space (TRANS)

Many years ago, the year The American went to the moon, asomebody I knew who=
=20
was in mathematics and worked on computers showed the following card tricl:=20=
He=20
held two card up face to face supporting each other, Then he placed a third=20
card leaning on the two. Then he placed a fouth sideways leaning on the thir=
d=20
and fifth leaning at an angle on the fourth. He continued this chain creatin=
g=20
quite a long zig zag of cards on the floor.

Then he removed one of the original two cards supporting each other. Instead=
=20
of the whole chain collapsing (that's what my logic would have told me), the=
=20
cards streched, leaned, forming eerie curves, parabolas.

I never forgot that. A series of events were creating their own relations,=20
stresses, transforming the original conception. Is that virtual limit, where=
 the=20
body does not break down but has develoved its own life form? Is that aura?

The obsolete protocol, where the language has reached its limit and is=20
"outed."?

Junk is antique, where the passage of time is compressed. Aura is uselessnes=

Obsolescence: in old photographs, most people in it are dead, the landscape=20
has changed or very subtle ways altered. That effect of time -a residue of o=
ld=20
light on material- is what gives a photographs its aura -each phtograph a=20
shroud of Turin. Is that what happens in a computer? That a medium of=20
hyperefficiency and communication suddenly becomes a cypher?

Is this not so even theoretically, obsoilescence embedded in the computer's=20
birth? Everything more efficient makes the less efficient extinct. We are=20
constantly, increasingly surrounded with ghosts of ideas, of which we (this=20
interchange we are engaged in) will become part.

>=20

Aura is hope.

"organism." Computers get "viruses." The illusion of "perfect reproduction"=20=

>=20
>=20
What did Dufrene say? Whose work?

Murat

"Dufrenne (sp) wrote on the phenomenology of literature - Kristeva took his
classes, and a translation of, I think it's called, The Aesthetics of the
Literary Work - something like that - was published by Northwestern.

As the computer becomes more and more 'organic,' its own memory will come
into play I think and that would be aura and its inherency.

I like what you write here greatly - perhaps you could send it to the
Poetics list with this note attached --

Thanks Alan"

PEaCE,

I stomp my feet and you feel my kai (for Usama ibn Zayid (as))

There are 18 points to my chamber
As hearts beat
Joints/
Voices lower
4/9 timed inna flow
to believers
stashed in tongues
w/blades
Slicing all the doubters
One
Left dumb
As you slap back
Whispers
Written on rain
Peltin jinns w/ stars
Scales wiped clean
Seen
mu'mineen
As you dream
Please believe
I ride these bars
 From my ego
Ima go
Workin spits over mento
B.U.T.
First Ima show you
Flex while I write
Notes real ill
Post Knos
Squeeze me like Jibril
Don’t dose
Leave you inna daze
Like those He chose
While the liquid writes Your praise
Look at you
Rising from slaves
Come born a master
Death reborns the first now
Last ones
Like
Prophets and Cholos
Lost to Pharohs
Hidden scrolls
Equality writs
Call it Qur’anic
Pass over
Quel que chose
Burnin brujahs
My brutha no nigga
He’s a son
Come on, ila
Summon Haritha
Stronge one
It's our future D.U.N.
I'll be the
Standard barers for
Usama
Build a bass with water
A super innovator
18yrs
A chosen warrior
Never visual
Simply
Subliminal
Possibly literal
Surats Novu
Real coo/coo
Like Incodules
I break the rules
As I kinda slapback
Whispers
Cappin pale bullers
Don’t even
Step into my square
Do you dare
Do you dare
Pelt that jinn w/ a stars
Death reborns the first bruhs
Now stroles the last ones
Breath taking is
My brutha
Coo ila
Born from clay
Spark a welly lighter in the hour
Of the last days
Silencing bagawires and soothersayers
Enter a shift
Watch an angel retire//
Protect me from the poets and the liars

Usama ibn Zyaid (ZAID) was the son of Zayid (Zaid) ibn Haritha who was
the adopted son of Muhammad. Haritha married a Nubian woman who gave him
a son Usama. Usama became a favourite of Muhammad and Muhammad treated
him like favourite grandson. Usama was a boy riding behind Muhammad on
the camel Qswar when Muhammad took back Makka. Usama became a general
for Muhammad at 18yrs and was assigned a great mission to lead a
campaign against the the Persians (Mu'ta) just at Muhammads death. The
older generals (still caught up in the old tribal system) refused to
follow such a young and "dark" general (and so of a freed slave) into
battle and refused Muhammads orders. Here is where Muhammad rose from
his sick bed to give his most famous and last speech concerning racism,
his people and the purpose and future of Islam.

"O People (mankind -- Nas), listen well to my words, for I do not know
whether I shall meet you again on such an occasion in the future. Today,
I have completed the Din (complete system of life) for you... and
selected for you Islam. All the pagan practices are crushed under my
feet. O people, your Lord is One. Without doubt, your father Adam is
one. No Arab has superiority over a non-Arab or a white over a black, or
a black over a white. Each Muslim is the brother of another Muslim, and
all Muslims are brothers. And as for your slaves, feed them what you
eat, and clothe them with what you wear. All revenge from bloodshed
during paganism is abolished. First and foremost, I forgive from my
family, Rabi'ah bin al- Harith's son's murder. All usury is abolished.
And first and foremost, from my family I abolish usury owed to my uncle,
'Abbas ibn 'Abdul Muttalib. Remember Allah in your dealings with women.
You have rights over women, and they have rights over you (equality in
relationship). Your life and property are sacred to you till the Day of
Reckoning. When Allah will question you about me, what will you say?"

 The companions replied, "You delivered the message, you fulfilled your
obligation." Muhammad (S) then raised his finger toward the sky and
repeated three times, "Allahumma Ashhad" (O Allah, You are the witness).

Festival an overwhelming success
*AUDIO & COMMENTARIES AVAILABLE*
http://carrboropoetryfestival.org

A big hearty "thank you" to those of you who came out to see & hear the terrific group of poets who gathered in Carrboro NC June 5 & 6 for the Carrboro Poetry Festival.

For those of you who missed out, audio of the event is now available in mp3 format at the festival website.

The festival was a success in ways I never imagined.  Two of the seven sessions were standing room only--especially amazing considering the festival was a poetry event unaffiliated with any writers organization, reading series, or university.  I had no idea what to expect, but I never expected so many people would stick around for ten hours of poetry.

The excitement of the participants was palpable.  I have never seen so many poets excited about poetry like they were that weekend.  Maybe it was the weather, the turnout, the after-hours discussions across the street on a porch at a well-known watering hole.  Who knows.  But the gang just sort of, well, coalesced.

In addition to the audio, the site also contains commentaries on the festival by Standard Schaefer and Christine Murray.  Their words I think capture much of the essence of the event.

If you would like to share your own experience of the festival, or any thoughts related to the event, write something and send it to me at patrick@carrboropoetryfestival.org.

Eh. Sounds great, but you know, I suspect the cave artist continued to paint in that dark scary cave because he was afraid that if he didn't placate the spirits with the best cave art he could make, a bear or smilodon would be sure to rip his head off next time he went out desperately hunting for his supper.

For those familiar and concerned with Bill Berkson of late, the good news is
that he's just recently become the possessor of a new set of good lungs! Now
becomes the no doubt up and down adventure of the new partnership.
Wishing him well after a long, rough and courageous spate,

"In her recent books, Elizabeth Treadwell has been pushing hard against
language to get to a deeper and often overlooked musicality in our world. In
Lilyfoil + 3 she arrives at a musicality that is feminist and angular; that
is Gertrude Stein and Mina Loy; that is pointed and luminous; that is, in
short, Lilyfoil, not lily flower."  -- Juliana Spahr

"Treadwell takes leaps 'unsubjected' to social mores and memory while these
are her materials." -- Leslie Scalapino

association of Northwest writers, intellectuals and artists seeking
socially engaged inquiry. SRI produces and promotes well-orchestrated
collusions between experimental aesthetics and revolutionary thought.

The Readers:

Lesley Hazelton is the award-winning author of Jerusalem Jerusalem,
England Bloody England, Confessions of a Fast Woman, and, most recently,
Mary: A Flesh and Blood Biography of the Real Virgin Mother, in which she
radically re-envisions the life of Mary, presenting her both as a real
woman and a spiritual healer.  Lesley is an expatriate Brit and a former
psychologist and political reporter with deep roots in both Judaism and
Catholicism; she lived in and reported from Jerusalem for 13 years. Her
work has appeared in Esquire, Vanity Fair, the New York Times, Harper's ,
The Nation, and elsewhere.

Diana George is a fiction writer and essayist whose work is included in
The Clear Cut Future. Diana's stories have appeared in Third Bed, Nest,
Post Road, the Denver Quarterly, and elsewhere. She is currently at work
on a book about the Green River area south of Seattle and a phenomenon she
calls "the Pastoral Abject."

Selah Saterstrom is a North Carolina-based writer whose fiction has
appeared most recently in Third Bed and E. Her novel, The Pink
Institution, has just been published by Coffee House Press.

Poeticers,

long no e.  Here's announcing the completion of a film, and launch of a =
website describing same.  The film is Chinese poet Du Peihua's "A Red =
Backdrop."  The website is here:
http://www.othershore-arts.net/
(see "Film" link; rest of the site is inchoate).  I'm responsible for the =
turgid prose (in the introductory essay and the so-called synopsis).

We're submitting the film to some festivals.  Will try to let folks here =
know if / when it surfaces in the UU (at least).

cheers,
David

Also, on another topic, this evening (in Washington DC) I enjoyed a =
reading (at bookstore Politics & Prose) by an old friend, the psychotherapi=

prove of interest to some folks here on several counts.  (Local bookstores =

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

"difficult to get carbide"


difficult to get carbide, calcium carbonate, necessary for the two miner's
lamps; the bottom chamber is filled with the same, water drips from the
upper, acetylene is produced which escapes from a nozzle, burning, a lime
residue is formed. but the lamps are outmoded, and apparently one needs a
permit for the substance, which is part and parcel of West Virginia
history; i want to illuminate bodies with the same, technical apparatus,
works; i want to see the reflective glow of heat on skin from fair
distance to fair distance.

the program is to eval an expression in x over a text, filtering out the
hits after taking the int. strings are needed in arrays, input and output
files, and the two programmers working with me, undergraduates, have been
three days at it, the room is cool, thermostat fixed so we're back at a
homeostatic temperature independent of the external world.

the project is to provide tools for working between code and the real,
thinking of any entity as filterable; one might eventually move from
[a < filter > b] to [<a filter b>] to [filter(b)]; in other words the
ontology moves from objects (a,b) to process/object(b) - which reflects on
states replaced by operators, entities replaced by processes etc., shades
of Whitehead here.

everyone born in WV that we've talked to has worked in the mines or has
relatives who have done so. one of the people we've met spent years
preparing lamps for his father and grandfather; i'm hopeful he'll be able
to help get it working again. he mentioned a place that still sells
carbide.

north-east England.

The reading is at:

No charges in Frank Paul death

WebPosted Jun 18 2004 02:46 PM PDT

VANCOUVER - The Crown has decided not to lay charges in the death of
Frank Paul, the aboriginal man dumped in an alley by Vancouver Police
officers in December 1998.

The 47-year-old Mi'kmaq man from New Brunswick died of exposure.

He had been held that night in the police drunk tank, but was later
dragged outside into the alley, still highly intoxicated.

Solicitor General Rich Coleman had forwarded the case to Crown lawyers
for a review. And they have now decided charges are not warranted.

This was the fifth time the Crown has looked at the case.

Crown spokesperson Geoff Gaul says a review of new evidence - two new
witness statements - determined no criminal charges should be laid.

"Is there sufficient evidence that we could prove on a criminal
standard, beyond a reasonable doubt, that somebody was culpable for Mr.
Paul's death.

"And the conclusion of all five assessments is that no, we can't prove
it." says Gaul.

The solicitor general has already rejected a call by the Police
Complaints Commissioner for a public inquiry.

Mysterious Death of Native Artist: Anthany Dawson

<mailto:montfu65@hotmail.com>

    It's not that Nancy Dawson hates the police or wishes them any ill
    will, she just doesn't like to look at them. Witness this morning's
    turn of events, as she headed out to attend the local gathering
    marking International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

    Gerald Kaboni

    <mailto:montfu65@hotmail.com>

        In the past few years, Victoria police have killed several
        Native and poor people, including Anthany Dawson and Gerald
        Kaboni. Since the BC Liberals and Gordon Campbell came to power
        Victoria police have struggled against the excluded class (poor
        and working people), giving the rich and middle-class the space
        to create a new path for the capitalist movement in Victoria.

    http://victoria.indymedia.org/news/2002/10/8537.php

    Was Gerald Kaboni murdered by Victoria police

        Was Gerald Kaboni murered by police?

    I have evidence turned down by the coroner's office that he was.
    Police give me run around on releasing critical evidence report.
    Chief of police hides out behind police immunity. ? At what point
    will people say," This is enough". I am tired of being harassed by
    police who are no better then the worst criminals they say they are
    protecting us from. No more. I know for sure police and media are
    silently reading this channel. Let them come out and state what
    hidden instruction they are receiving and who they protecting.
    Police Chief denies public interview with Mayoral candidates. Who
    and what is he hideing?

The Bee Dealer





My eyes, fools say, have been too full
of wine for me to count. If I glare into headlights
and keep counting, I will get a lucky price
for my bees, will stop thinking of divorce

when I see the letter “D.” And I know
the number of bees in my hives, know the number
of ounces in all the jars, know the ounces of honey
the people in the town consume, know

the number of ounces the average town gobbles,
know neighbors speculate why I left
my mathematical job, know the number
of bullets in my pocket, know

every person near a window must consume
honey sweet as a town without gossip.

Just Bread



I come to you in evening light
rubbed with aromatics,
bathed in olive oil and
warmed by the heat
of another day’s controlled oppression.
Laying myself before you, calling your name.
Call me Foccacia. I will go well with the soft fare
of Italy.  Place an olive on my tongue.
You cringe and move away.
Such a wide loaf, too tough
to pull and peel, too coarse,
perhaps too natural, you think
but do not say.

I roll in coriander, cardamom
and strange herbs of the motherland
waiting to be used.  They color me
the orange whisper of ambasha
and I wait in the night
for the soft rustle
of your feet upon the sand,
for the gray dawn at your back,
for you bringing home the product
of your stealth in far-off lands.
I awake to find you sleeping on the sofa
the scepter of your kingdom in one hand
the blue light from your many windowed watchtower
flashing indeterminate across a wide screen
and this is how we dance:
I close my eyes, imagine we
can meet here in this place of dreams.
I hold you in the foreign vision
of a woman you have not known.

You will take the prey—it will not matter
what kind, whatever spices there contained.
However long I marinate, roast, baste, bake or saute,
you will ask for it on Schwebel's—potato, if you please—
place it, press it between two slices
and love the soft yellow of their scream
because nothing else, after all, is bread.
Because anything pressed hard enough
becomes a sandwich anyway.

sounds a bit like object-oriented programming, where functions become
objects, then when attached to objects, transform objects into
functions.

The WVU material is great. I've been especially entranced by the images
coald.jpg and alta004.jpg. The alta004 is wonderfully mediated in my
viewing; my monitor is set to 1024x768, but the image is so large I can
only view a quarter at a time. When it loads, the cylinder forms a right
border to the sky; not enough shows to create any 3-D sense of it as
a cylinder. As I scroll sideways to bring the whole cylinder into view,
there is no perspective shift--I don't have the lower half of the image
with the trees in the background to provide depth--so it retains a 2-D
appearance and as such is mysterious. It is like nothing I recognize.
Scrolling down provides some perspective and transforms the image while I
am looking, as if it were alive, maybe taking a breath.

The surface of the cylinder is beautifully etched and scarred. This
dimension of texture, that is often the subject of your photos, has taught
me to look in a new way. Sometimes I will notice a surface texture that,
by adding a visual dimension to the surface, seems also to add a dimension
of history to the object, giving it a voice. This is how alt004 becomes an
effective documentation of what must already be an icon of WV history. The
image coald.jpg, set against this mediated viewing alt004, allegorizes
the documentation process.

Annie, so sorry for the slow response!  I've got two little kids taking up all
my time and have also been trying to get ready for Orono - you'll be there,
yes?  I hope we have a chance to meet and talk.  Meantime, I think the best way
to answer your question is by asking another: Why does Duncan believe the poem
*should* be "a field for discovery"?  There lies his pragmatist orientation,
his motive (in Burke's sense of that term).  And the answer, I think, comes
from Dewey, who Duncan admires greatly:

A philosophy animated, be it consciously or unconsciously, by the strivings of
men to achieve democracy will construe liberty as meaning a universe in which
there is real uncertainty and contingency, a world which is not all in, and
never will be, a world which in some respect is incomplete and in the making,
and in these respects may be made this way or that according as men judge,
prize, love and labor...a genuine field of novelty, of real and unpredictable
increments to existence, a field for experimentation and invention [That's from
"Philosophy and Democracy" 1918 in Dewey, Middle Works 11:50].

Chnage "Philosophy" to "poem" and you have Duncan, and indeed, Black Mountain
generally.

Looking forward to meeting you!

Mike

The BOOK is technology, and INVENTED shelf life.

The Poem existed pre-book.

The poem is the poem when you "read" it aloud, evn if you aren't "reading  it
(ie, it is memorized, or created on the fly freestyle.

The poem on film on TV is nuttin but the poem. It is no more a translation
than writing is from voicing.

The first two paragraphs (below) of this AP article on the release of the
torture permission documents make me wish I were teaching lit again. Would
fit right into a class segment on the Oxymoron - or maybe in an a
comparative analysis with Fitzgerald's, "The test of a first rate
intelligence is to be able to hold two opposing two ideas in your head at
the same time" (my paraphrase). I think our boy Bush tries to come off here
as saying, "I had permission to authorize torture but I did not order the
torture that took place though I was the only one that could order the
torture so the torture took place in spite of my order."
O well these boys and girls do keep crawling into a deeper hole. One only
worries that for Bush to regain his now lost captain's hat for leading the
war on terror, that his'n folk are not beyond provoking a little or big
domestic terror event to prove his highly questionable meddle.  Yes, I say,
be vigilant and for silliness watch Ashcroft declare arrests of terrorists
in every swing state - as he recently did in Ohio with someone who had
already been incarcerated for 18 months. Oh well, timing is everything.

"White House Releases Documents on Detainees

The Associated Press
Tuesday, June 22, 2004; 8:08 PM


President Bush claimed the right to waive anti-torture laws and treaties
covering prisoners of war after the invasion of Afghanistan, and Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld authorized guards to strip detainees and threaten
them with dogs, according to documents released Tuesday.
 The documents were handed out at the White House in an effort to blunt
allegations that the administration had authorized torture against al-Qaida
prisoners from Afghanistan and Iraq. "I have never ordered torture," Bush
said a few hours before the release..."

Hoping someone here can help with this --

I heard Thomas read this four years ago or so, haven't seen it
published anywhere, and I'm not sure I recall the line all that well.
How's that for a start? Anyway, the poem I'm looking for is about
Florida, and ends with something like, "Once they grew oranges. Their
children make license plates."

Anyone have a clue where I can find this?

A Note from a natty Son: From abdi to nabi to the nas

Mohammed did not abolish slavery for the words came from God because
Mohammed was a Prophet/Nabi who was a beloved/habib of God and so
slavery was abolished by God. ...and unlike the Pentateuch,  the system
was abolished within the Qur'an = The Spoken/Recited/to Recite.   It
takes an Overstanding of the histories and language inorder to Truely
summon meaning into the texte presented.

 From abdi to nabi to the nas...

Prior to the Qur'an (outside of Roman culture which involved buying
yourself into freedom B.U.T. never freeDOME for you remained a labeled
product of your past master) there was no system of manumission -- the
freeing of a slave,  nor was there anything which caused the person to
be treated as a person/employee instead of, like the amerikkkan system
did and does -- property with the title of cattle/livestock.
Leviticus/Veyrichra does have a large section concerning the 'treatment
of a slave" which involves beatings and the beatings of the children of
slaves, however, it does offer a guide away from abuse B.U.T. not
equality. ...and this is what the quip is concerning --  the US slavery.
Usama's father Zayid (Zaid) was adopted by Muhammed and therefore took
on his name. The Qur'an  forbade adoption and so Zayid had to take on a
name of his own and not remain attached like property. So Zayid took on
his fathers name (which is the law) and became Zayid ibn Haritha. So we
see the Culture/identity being returned to the slave who remains a
freeman and not an exslave B.U.T. is still reminded of his state of
slavery to this world = abdi.  History -- a person's history is of great
importance and if you wish to CONtrol that person or persons you
demolish the history and destroy the memory of the name and association
and reDEVILope it in your own image.  So Usama was truely born into a
free state for he new his father/he knew his fathers name and with his
father he knew his grandfathers names, as well as, his foster
grandfather = Muhammed. Thus he was free to chose to be only an abdullah
=  a Muslim in Islam

If one actually took time to find out what the struggle was about then
you would know what Mohammed's speech was concerning.  The struggle of
the  period and philosophy is an indepth history centred around "anti-
poetics" , the dismissing of humans and the soul as property.  It is the
preface and body of the Science of Life = "Protect me from the poets and
the liars." For poets, although on occasion  produce imitations of
beauty, are often victims of poets and poetry as lifestyle and the
mass/production of "occasional" pieces which deal more with pleasing the
crowd and the despot than it does with reciting the truth thus leaving
life and the thing as frivolous -- The Hagakure  has a philosophy
concerning such approaches = "do nothing frivolous".  ...so this note,
my friend, is not frivolous for it is not a note to you. Poets.
...during the time of Mohammed and prior to that were play things who
battled infront of the Ka'aba; who allowed themselves to be used to
attack people for a price and for acceptance with the tribal leaders.
they allowed themselves to be tools for trade and words an economic
commodity up for grabs to the highest bidder. ...and words became cruel
and cold. Mohammed, who Maxim Rodison refers to as a "primitive
recording device" spoke not poetry B.U.T. the flow and flex of God.
...so no one could challenge it. " So throw what  you are going to
throw" my friend.  However, they were paid dearly to humiliate and
assault Mohammed with words for a price. So poetry became prostitution
as it did most sadly during the Alexandrian period of poetics as
decorative art and then the Restoration Period as poetics as whoring
verse for the court/elite as it does now in these times.

Shall I inform you upon whom shayatin descends?
They descend on every lying, sinful person.
Who gives ear (to the devils and they pour what they
may have heard  of the Unseen (Zahir) from the angels)
and most of them are liars
As for the poets, the erring ones follow them,
See you not that they speak about every subject (praising
people -- right or wrong) in poetry?
And that they say what they do not do.
--ash shu'ara 221-224

Do you overstand?  ...were you looking to Overstand?  Did you think that
Usama was a name only attributed to Usama bin Ladin?

Oh the dilemma of Being Osama

http://victoria.indymedia.org/news/2004/05/26333.php

http://victoria.indymedia.org/news/2004/06/26497.php

Professor Russell once said; "If you're going to hate anything, know it
well."

Slavery is a translation of "abd(i)" and thus you have many names
(besides Usama = strong or the attributes of the myth surrounding a
lion) which include this = abdullah = slave to God. ...and so one fears
no man only God who is be followed and is considered a master and
therefore one who is merciful and compassionate. Therefore, one should
attempt the imitation or example of God/The Godhead. If so all men are
slaves and if all men are slaves then all should only be treated they
way they wish to be treated themselves and wish for others the good they
wish for themselves  = "And as for your slaves, feed them what you eat,
and clothe them with what you wear. " All men are the masters of maliks
= angels = michan = workers = michael = workers or messengers of "EL" =
God. So abd and "slave" is a state of existence which renders all men
equal in struggle and respect ...and not centred around the Amerikkkan
atrocity of slavery which is what people use to fuel the hate. This is a
form of "slave" = servant = slave = employed in a person's "service,
from the latin servare = slave = serv (ant).  it is saying that your
employed should be treated with dignity and with equality and not like
property unlike the amerikkkan "slavery" where the "slave" was not a
"servant" or the employed B.U.T. live stock and thus atrocities can be
performed on them and were. So we have the amerikkkan taking the moral
highground and playing upon this abomiNATION and not correcting their
holocaust B.U.T. using the weighted term to attack peoples out of
historical contexte while manipulating words in their favour = the
ignorance of poets.

*Usama ibn Zyaid (ZAID) was the son of Zayid (Zaid) ibn Haritha who was
the adopted son of Mohammed. Haritha married a Nubian woman who gave him
a son Usama. Usama became a favourite of Mohammed and Mohammed treated
him like favourite grandson. Usama was a boy riding behind Mohammed on
the camel Qswar when Mohammed took back Makka. Usama became a general
for Mohammed at 18yrs and was assigned a great mission to lead a
campaign against the the Persians (Mu'ta) just at Muhammads death. The
older generals (still caught up in the old tribal system) refused to
follow such a young and "dark" general (and son of a freed slave) into
battle and refused Muhammads orders. Here is where Mohammed rose from
his sick bed to give his most famous and last speech concerning racism,
his people and the purpose and future of Islam.

"O People (mankind -- Nas), listen well to my words, for I do not know
whether I shall meet you again on such an occasion in the future. Today,
I have completed the Din (complete system of life) for you... and
selected for you Islam. All the pagan practices are crushed under my
feet. O people, your Lord is One. Without doubt, your father Adam is
one. No Arab has superiority over a non-Arab or a white over a black, or
a black over a white. Each Muslim is the brother of another Muslim, and
all Muslims are brothers. And as for your slaves, feed them what you
eat, and clothe them with what you wear. All revenge from bloodshed
during paganism is abolished. First and foremost, I forgive from my
family, Rabi'ah bin al- Harith's son's murder. All usury is abolished.
And first and foremost, from my family I abolish usury owed to my uncle,
'Abbas ibn 'Abdul Muttalib. Remember Allah in your dealings with women.
You have rights over women, and they have rights over you (equality in
relationship). Your life and property are sacred to you till the Day of
Reckoning. When Allah will question you about me, what will you say?"

The companions replied, "You delivered the message, you fulfilled your
obligation." Mohammed (S) then raised his finger toward the sky and
repeated three times, "Allahumma Ashhad" (O Allah, You are the witness).

i don't keep too much to myself either but i think you missed the point
here what you said to /about me in your imitation of my poem was uncalled
for it contained sleeze never said you were a sleeze if you want to teach
me something about poetry and believe me we all have alot to learn you
can do it differently or be nasty on the back burners that's what i take
it the expression backchanneling means i'm still a kid at 60 you , i'm
guessing are still one at 25-30 perhaps? fine you can have the last word
on this if you like i'm tired.
show me a good substitute for those lazy likes in my work we all still
need to learn alot

A Note from a natty Son:

Mohammed did abolish slavery, and unlike the Pentateuch,  the system was
abolished within the Qur'an. There was no system of manumission -- the
freeing of a slave,  nor was there anything which caused the person to
be treated as a person/employee instead of, like the amerikkkan system
did and does -- property with the title of cattle/livestock.
Leviticus/Varicha does have a large section concerning the 'treatment of
a slave" which involves beatings and the beatings of the children of
slaves, however, it does offer a guide away from abuse B.U.T. not
equality. ...and this is what the quip is concerning --  the US slavery.
If you actually took time to find out what the struggle was about then
you would know what Mohammed's speech was concerning.  The struggle of
the  period and philosophy is an indepth history centred around "anti-
poetics" , the dismissing of humans and the soul as property.  It is the
preface and body of the Science of Life = "Protect me from the poets and
the liars." For poets, although on occasion  produce imitations of
beauty, are often victims of poets and poetry as lifestyle and the
mass/production of "occasional" pieces which deal more with pleasing the
crowd and the despot than it does with reciting the truth thus leaving
life and the thing as frivolous -- The Hagakure  has a philosophy
concerning such approaches = "do nothing frivolous".  ...so this note,
my friend, is not frivolous for it is not a note to you. Poets.
...during the time of Mohammed and prior to that were play things who
battled infront of the Ka'aba; who allowed themselves to be used to
attack people for a price and for acceptance with the tribal leaders.
they allowed themselves to be tools for trade and words an economic
commodity up for grabs to the highest bidder. ...and words became cruel
and cold. Mohammed, who Maxim Rodison refers to as a "primitive
recording device" spoke not poetry B.U.T. the flow and flex of God.
...so no one could challenge it. " So throw what  you are going to
throw" my friend.  However, they were paid dearly to humiliate and
assault Mohammed with words for a price. So poetry became prostitution
as it did most sadly during the Alexandrian period of poetics as
decorative art and then the Restoration Period as poetics as whoring
verse for the court/elite as it does now in these times.

Shall I inform you upon whom shayatin descends?
They descend on every lying, sinful person.
Who gives ear (to the devils and they pour what they
may have heard  of the Unseen (Zahir) from the angels)
and most of them are liars
As for the poets, the erring ones follow them,
See you not that they speak about every subject (praising
people -- right or wrong) in poetry?
And that they say what they do not do.
--ash shu'ara 221-224

Do you overstand?  ...were you looking to Overstand?  Did you think that
Usama was a name only attributed to Usama bin Ladin?

Oh the dilemma of Being Osama

http://victoria.indymedia.org/news/2004/05/26333.php

http://victoria.indymedia.org/news/2004/06/26497.php

Professor Russell once said; "If you're going to hate anything, know it
well."

Slavery is a translation of "abd" and thus you have many names (besides
Usama) which include this = abdullah = slave to God. ...and so one fears
no man only God who is be followed and is considered a master and
therefore one who is merciful and compassionate. Therefore, one should
attempt the imitation or example of God/The Godhead. If so all men are
slaves and if all men are slaves then all should only be treated they
way they wish to be treated themselves and wish for others the good they
wish for themselves  = "And as for your slaves, feed them what you eat,
and clothe them with what you wear. " All men are the masters of maliks
= angels = michan = workers = michael = workers or messengers of "EL" =
God. So abd and "slave" is a state of existence which renders all men
equal in struggle and respect ...and not centred around the Amerikkkan
atrocity of slavery which is what people use to fuel the hate. This is a
form of "slave" = servant = slave = employed in a person's "service,
from the latin servare = slave = serv (ant).  it is saying that your
employed should be treated with dignity and with equality and not like
property unlike the amerikkkan "slavery" where the "slave" was not a
"servant" or the employed B.U.T. live stock and thus atrocities can be
performed on them and were. So we have the amerikkkan taking the moral
highground and playing upon this abomiNATION and not correcting their
holocaust B.U.T. using the weighted term to attack peoples out of
historical contexte while manipulating words in their favour = the
ignorance of poets.

*Usama ibn Zyaid (ZAID) was the son of Zayid (Zaid) ibn Haritha who was
the adopted son of Mohammed. Haritha married a Nubian woman who gave him
a son Usama. Usama became a favourite of Mohammed and Mohammed treated
him like favourite grandson. Usama was a boy riding behind Mohammed on
the camel Qswar when Mohammed took back Makka. Usama became a general
for Mohammed at 18yrs and was assigned a great mission to lead a
campaign against the the Persians (Mu'ta) just at Muhammads death. The
older generals (still caught up in the old tribal system) refused to
follow such a young and "dark" general (and son of a freed slave) into
battle and refused Muhammads orders. Here is where Mohammed rose from
his sick bed to give his most famous and last speech concerning racism,
his people and the purpose and future of Islam.

"O People (mankind -- Nas), listen well to my words, for I do not know
whether I shall meet you again on such an occasion in the future. Today,
I have completed the Din (complete system of life) for you... and
selected for you Islam. All the pagan practices are crushed under my
feet. O people, your Lord is One. Without doubt, your father Adam is
one. No Arab has superiority over a non-Arab or a white over a black, or
a black over a white. Each Muslim is the brother of another Muslim, and
all Muslims are brothers. And as for your slaves, feed them what you
eat, and clothe them with what you wear. All revenge from bloodshed
during paganism is abolished. First and foremost, I forgive from my
family, Rabi'ah bin al- Harith's son's murder. All usury is abolished.
And first and foremost, from my family I abolish usury owed to my uncle,
'Abbas ibn 'Abdul Muttalib. Remember Allah in your dealings with women.
You have rights over women, and they have rights over you (equality in
relationship). Your life and property are sacred to you till the Day of
Reckoning. When Allah will question you about me, what will you say?"

The companions replied, "You delivered the message, you fulfilled your
obligation." Mohammed (S) then raised his finger toward the sky and
repeated three times, "Allahumma Ashhad" (O Allah, You are the witness).

A REMINDER:

 ---

 CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS: We seek submissions for an anthology of younger
 Canadian poets. If you consider what you write to be poetry, we would love
 to see your work.

 We wish to include writers whose writing invites a reader's intention.
These
 writers may have previous publications, they may be friends of yours, they
 may live in your basement, they may write using your hands. The emphasis of
 the anthology is on a physical manifestation of a nonlocatable community of
 writers; it doesn't matter where you live or who you know -- the anthology
 will plot the virtual neighbourhoods in which rising Canadian authors live.

 SUBMISSION DEADLINE: July 1st, 2004

 ELIGIBILITY: The anthology will focus on new, younger Canadian poets. These
 poets may have an interest in expanding their definition of poetry through
 exploratory writing in traditional, visual, found, constraint-based, sound,
 mathematic, surreal, collaborative, and prose forms. Authors may also take
interest in
 developing a personal poetics that is reflected in their writing. The
 anthology will work to represent both the explorative and community-based
 practices with which up-and-coming authors engage.

 SUBMIT: Please send 15-20 pages of unpublished or published poetry (please
 indicate if published). Poetic statements or other supplementary materials
 are welcome, but not required. Please include a self-addressed stamped
 envelope (SASE) if you are sending via snail mail and would like a
response.

 CONTACT: We are happy to accept submissions via e-mail at
 anthology@commutiny.net or by mail at Anthology c/o commutiny.net, 37A
 Bellwoods Ave., Toronto, ON, M6J 3N4. We are happy to accept the following
 file formats via e-mail: *.doc, *.jpg, *.pdf, *.tif, and *.txt. If you
would
 like to send a different file format, please inquire first. If you have
 questions, feel free to drop us an e-mail. We thank all authors who submit
 work in advance. We will be in contact within four months after the
 deadline.

 This information is available online at
http://commutiny.net/anthology.html.

 PLEASE FORWARD WIDELY. THANK YOU!

Commission Finds 9/11 Attacks Predicted 420 Years Ago By Italian Philosopher:

Trade Center And Pentagon
by Edgar Cayce Nostradamus



They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

from Michael Moore's website, on the release of Fahrenheit 9/11:

"As of this morning, a little over 500 theaters have agreed to show the
movie beginning next Friday, June 25. There are three national/regional
theater chains who, as of today, have not booked the movie in their
theaters. One theater owner in Illinois has reported receiving death
threats.

"The right wing usually wins these battles. Their basic belief system is

built on censorship, repression, and keeping people ignorant. They want
to
limit or snuff out any debate or dissension. They also don't like pets
and
are mean to small children. Too many of them are named 'Fred.'"

WHAT:  The Projects Reading Series

WHO:  Sarah Mangold (Seattle) & Selah Saterstrom (Ashville, NC)

The Projects Reading Series is hosting the second of an ongoing reading =
series located at 1506 Projects, a small, intimate art gallery on =
Capitol Hill.  Readings are scheduled at the writers=92 convenience.  =
Sarah Mangold has been a long and active member of the Seattle literary =
community.  She has read at many venues around town including the =
Subtext Reading Series and at Open Books.  She is the editor of the =
well-wrought literary magazine Bird Dog.  Tonight we will be celebrating =
the publication of Boxer Rebellion, a handsomely made chapbook by g o n =
g (Drew Kuntz, editor).  She has two other books out--Blood Substitutes =
and her full-length collection Household Mechanics.  She has told me =
that she has been at work on Boxer Rebellion for five years.  I=92ve =
read the result and it=92s beautiful.  Trust me, I=92m an editor.

=20

We  will also be proudly presenting Selah Saterstrom, from Ashville, =
North Carolina.  This year has seen the release of her first book, The =
Pink Institution, published by Coffee House Press.  Selah will be making =
a sort of Pacific Northwest Tour aided by the kind associates of the =
Seattle Research Institute.

=20

The Pink Institution and Boxer Rebellion are both family portraits, =
although of very different sorts.  Boxer Rebellion takes as its source =
text =93The Reminiscences of Mrs. Roy C. Smith, Jr.=94 (U.S. Naval =
Institute, Annapolis, Maryland, 1986).  From this strange source, Sarah =
Mangold has created a book with a sharp ear towards spoken speech =
truncated and spliced and repositioned into new rhythmic patterns.  The =
Pink Institution although treading on a similar theme is another =
creature altogether.  At once sumptuous and hideous, Selah =
Saterstrom=92s The Pink Institution is an intergenerational saga loaded =
with sordid events.  Still, it maintains its humanity through its =
languid, abstracted style.  It reads to me more like a sustained prose =
poem than a novel, but perhaps that=92s just the territory where the =
novel should be going.

=20

I=92m very excited to present these two writers.  They=92re projects, =
although similar, are so strikingly different that should inflect off =
each other in quite interesting ways.

SARAH MANGOLD

Sarah Mangold is the author of Blood Substitutes (Potes & Poets Press =
chapbook series, 1998) and her first book Household Mechanics (New =
Issues, 2002) was selected by C.D. Wright for the New Issues Poetry =
Prize. She is the recipient of an Individual Artist Award from the =
Seattle Arts Commission and a MacDowell Colony fellowship. She lives in =
Seattle and edits Bird Dog: a journal of innovative writing and art.

SELAH SATERSTROM

Selah Saterstrom=92s work has appeared or is forthcoming in Web =
Conjunctions, Tarpaulin Sky, Monkey Puzzle, and The Seattle Research =
Institute's Experimental Theology. Her novel, The Pink Institution, is =
published by Coffee House Press. She teaches text/image arts at Warren =
Wilson College in Asheville, NC.

UbuWeb is pleased to announce the re-launch and permanent home of curator Otis F. Odder's
365 Days Project. This legendary project, in which an MP3 a day -- of mostly outsider,
novelty, and oddball recordings -- was made available for the public to download over the
course of 2003. Briefly taken offline at the end of the project, it is now presented here
in its entirety, complete with images and vast commentary on each selection. The 365 Days
Project is part of UbuWeb's redesigned, newly-named and much-expanded Outsiders section.

Steve, okay, let me make myself clear here

your attitude is not an issue with me, in fact
i like your attitude

my problem with you is how you don't seem to be
able to take what you dish out.

but my favorite ironic thing about you is that you
instruct me to tone it down, to cut the sleeze, and
you become pious, and SUDDENLY tender-eared, but at
the same time want to act the tough guy who likes
Bukowski, i mean, wow.  i need to tone it down?
no.  one man's sleeze is another man's Bukowski, baby.

think of me as a big fag Bukowski, if you must.
no is my refrain to cutting, editing, and shutting up.

one VERY good thing about being queer in America is all
the shit you hear yourself being called while growing
up:  that very shit either snaps you into pieces, or it
prepares you for seeing the power and/or powerlessness
in all words.  my masculinity is never threatened, i've
got a bitch whore woman inside me (lessons from my bitch
whore of a mother) keeping my other half in constant check.

and how we got to this from Mark Rudd doesn't matter,
let it all happen,
CAConrad

The fatal brunette
walks into our salon, with
her brand-new thug
boyfriend on her arm, since

Nissans rubbed smooth like diamond mines
layer themselves slowly along the firmament, drugs
scuffing their fists on what they had to know:

I want you to help me
swear out an insanity plea
against her. Get up
to turn it down. Rooms
smolder down to
handsome ash. Women
swoon. Somnabulism
bolsters skulls
motherfucker.

Save us all a lot of unpleasantness by riding
back to town with me all sanguine and obscured
by light, but stepping ever so surely on.

What do you think, Taylor, might be the subtext here? My thought,
"No jobs in the orchards, go to prison."

Or maybe that the mind leaps to make some kind of resolve out of the
disjoint, is the appeal, this process of meta-leaping over the text.
Excuse the "ap-pealing" pun!

Who's going to first (pregnant) family to name their new kid, "Fahrenheit"?

That would be a defining cultural marker to carry forth.  I kind of like
"Fahren" for short.

Steve, okay, let me make myself clear here

your attitude is not an issue with me, in fact
i like your attitude

my problem with you is how you don't seem to be

instruct me to tone it down, to cut the sleeze, and
you become pious, and SUDDENLY tender-eared, but at

Bukowski, i mean, wow.  i need to tone it down?
no.  one man's sleeze is another man's Bukowski, baby.

think of me as a big fag Bukowski, if you must.
no is my refrain to cutting, editing, and shutting up.

one VERY good thing about being queer in America is all
the shit you hear yourself being called while growing
up:  that very shit either snaps you into pieces, or it
prepares you for seeing the power and/or powerlessness

The Killing in Iraq Continues.
The Criminalization of Dissent and Prosecution of War Resisters
Continues in Canada.

* Anti-war organizer in court June 24 & 25 in Kingston *
Please call the Crown from outside Kingston. (phone numbers below)
Help pack the court room with supporters if you live here.
Paul Quick will be on trial this week in Kingston for participating in a
peaceful demonstration against the racist war in Iraq, imperialism and
corporate profiteering, last March 22.

The Kingston anti-war marches were spontaneous and creative and left the
local authorities flat footed. Millions of people around the world
demonstrated against the war before it even started, and Kingston was no
exception. 400 local marchers evaded police during marches against the
imminent invasion of Iraq.

Mr. Quick was targeted by the police not because of his actions that
day, but because he is a clear voice of dissent. Aggression for profit,
murder for money and blood for oil cannot be tolerated. Were the war to
be stopped, it was to be done by the people of the planet, not their
elected officials. Paul was one of millions of people around the world
standing for freedom and justice in the period leading up to the war. We
must continue our work against war and imperialism and we must defend
our fellow organizers against state reaction.

Paul Quick's charges should be dropped immediately. Please contact the
Crown Attorney's office (today!) and tell them to drop all charges
against Mr. Quick.

Kingston Crown Attorney Bruce Griffith
Tel. (613) 548-6220
Fax: (613) 548-6692
If you are in the Kingston area, Paul's trial is Thursday June 24 and
Friday June 25 at the Provincial Court House on Wellington St. (the OHIP
building) 9:00 am.

Aleikum salaam,
Many Thanks.

I do not have the sorce of this.. but the issues have come up on this
list...

WorldNetDaily.com
President Bush plans to unveil next month a sweeping mental health
initiative that recommends screening for every citizen and promotes the
use of expensive antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs favored by
supporters of the administration.

The New Freedom Initiative, according to a progress report, seeks to
integrate mentally ill patients fully into the community by providing
"services in the community, rather than institutions," the British
Medical Journal reported.

Critics say the plan protects the profits of drug companies at the
expense of the public.

The initiative began with Bush's launch in April 2002 of the New
Freedom Commission on Mental Health, which conducted a "comprehensive
study of the United States mental health service delivery system."

The panel found that "despite their prevalence, mental disorders often
go undiagnosed" and recommended comprehensive mental health s! creening
for "consumers of all ages," including preschool children.

The commission said, "Each year, young children are expelled from
preschools and childcare facilities for severely disruptive behaviors
and emotional disorders."

Schools, the panel concluded, are in a "key position" to screen the 52
million students and 6 million adults who work at the schools.

The commission recommended that the screening be linked with "treatment
and supports," including "state-of-the-art treatments" using "specific
medications for specific conditions."

The Texas Medication Algorithm Project, or TMAP, was held up by the
panel as a "model" medication treatment plan that "illustrates an
evidence-based practice that results in better consumer outcomes."

The TMAP -- started in 1995 as an alliance of individuals from the
pharmaceutical industry, the University of Texas and the mental health
and corrections systems of Texas -- also was praised by the American !
Psychiatric Association, which called for increased funding to impleme
nt the overall plan.

But the Texas project sparked controversy when a Pennsylvania
government employee revealed state officials with influence over the
plan had received money and perks from drug companies who stand to gain
from it.

Allen Jones, an employee of the Pennsylvania Office of the Inspector
General says in his whistleblower report the "political/pharmaceutical
alliance" that developed the Texas project, which promotes the use of
newer, more expensive antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs, was
behind the recommendations of the New Freedom Commission, which were
"poised to consolidate the TMAP effort into a comprehensive national
policy to treat mental illness with expensive, patented medications of
questionable benefit and deadly side effects, and to force private
insurers to pick up more of the tab."

Jones points out, according to the British Medical Journal, companies
that helped start the Texas project are major contributors to Bush's
elect! ion funds. Also, some members of the New Freedom Commission have
served on advisory boards for these same companies, while others have
direct ties to TMAP.

Eli Lilly, manufacturer of olanzapine, one of the drugs recommended in
the plan, has multiple ties to the Bush administration, BMJ says. The
elder President Bush was a member of Lilly's board of directors and
President Bush appointed Lilly's chief executive officer, Sidney
Taurel, to the Homeland Security Council.

Of Lilly's $1.6 million in political contributions in 2000, 82 percent
went to Bush and the Republican Party.

Another critic, Robert Whitaker, journalist and author of "Mad in
America," told the British Medical Journal that while increased
screening "may seem defensible," it could also be seen as "fishing for
customers."

Exorbitant spending on new drugs "robs from other forms of care such as
job training and shelter program," he said.

However, a developer of the Texas project,! Dr. Graham Emslie, defends
screening.

"There are good data sho wing that if you identify kids at an earlier
age who are aggressive, you can intervene ... and change their
trajectory."

Literary community stands behind ousted poet Liebler
By Susan Whitall / The Detroit News

Poetic outrage percolated through the literary community this past week as
news spread that M.L. Liebler was ousted as director of the Writers Voice
literary program run by the Metro Detroit YMCA.

Just one day after the Y’s move last Thursday, Liebler had arranged for a
new literary group to operate out of Detroit’s Scarab Club, and he’ll be
onstage performing on opening night, July 12, at the seventh annual Poets
at the Opera House series.

“The writing community did not miss a beat,” Liebler says.

Still, news of the Y’s action did not sit well in the local literary
scene.

“I’m a poet, and ‘outrage’ is the only word I can come up with,” says
Cheri Roberts of Canton Township. “The YMCA has lost sight of the fact
that the writers in this community consider themselves to be a family.”

A respected Wayne State English professor and published poet — his latest
collection of poetry, “The Moon a Box,” came out a few months ago —
Liebler started the Writers Voice at the Y back in 1995. As of May, it had
200 dues-paying members and brings famous poets to Detroit for readings,
sponsors poetry classes and distributes the Writers’ Voice newsletter.

Poet Mary Ann Wehler, who worked as Liebler’s administrative assistant at
the Writers Voice, was also let go. “I think it’s a sad day,” she says.
“They said they’d like me to continue as an instructor for the Writers
Voice, but there’s no way.” Wehler also says that the other four Writers
Voice instructors wouldn’t stay on.

For their part, the YMCA, according to spokesman Dan Maier, was “in the
process of changing” its arts programs.

“We changed our only part-time position to a contract teaching position,”
says Maier, executive vice president. “(Liebler) was offered a contract
position to teach on a project-by-project basis. As we expand,” Maier
says, referring to the opening of the new downtown YMCA in 2005, “we hoped
and trusted that he would be part of that expansion.”

Liebler was puzzled by that. “I was never offered a teaching position. I
was escorted out of the building,” he says. “They asked if I’d be a
consultant, but because I’m starting up another literary program, I said I
didn’t know if I’d be able to do that.”

Since the United Way slashed funding to groups such as the YMCA, Liebler
knew there was a huge budget crunch looming.

“Readings and things like that would have to be done away with or
suspended,” the poet says. “So things began to deteriorate. The budget
kept getting smaller and smaller. My wages were decent, and that was
probably a big part of the budget.”

The new group Liebler and others are starting — he’s still pondering a
name for it — will be smaller and on a volunteer basis, but he’s been
there before.

Liebler was president of the Poetry Resource Center back in the early
’90s, when Michigan Gov. John Engler took office and slashed funding for
the arts, setting groups like the PRC adrift.

“The difference between then and now is that there wasn’t the big support
for poetry and literature that there is now,” Liebler says.

“We’re thrilled that M.L. is starting up a new literary group at the
Scarab Club,” says poet Roberts, who is among those who have asked the
Writers Voice to refund their subscription money. “We’ll be there when it
starts.”

Here's a comment from Stephen Paul Martin





'When your books came yesterday, just as I was putting mine in the mail for
you, I picked up Commercial Fiction planning initially to just page thru it
and then read it carefully over spring break in a few weeks, but found
myself so caught up in it that I read it in one sitting. I really can't
remember the last time I read an extended work in one sitting. It's a great
book, a book I've always felt someone should write, thinking maybe I would
do it at some point--and now I don't have to. You've taken the shallow,
mind-numbing world of mass communication and used it against itself,
appropriating its techniques and making them work as fiction, as a text that
can inspire intelligent reflection rather than consumer idiocy. At the same
time, you've taken the possibility of media critique through fiction and
shown that it's already trapped in precisely what it intends to subvert. Yet
you make this work as an aspect of the critique, since your position as
meta-author is ultimately outside the pseudo-maelstrom of commodity
capitalism and its image system. Or is it? By spilling past the putative
closure implied by your meta-authorial perspective, you force us to confront
the possibility that any "victory" over mass imagery is dubious. And you
make it all so much fun. I loved the monster movie references at the end.
And the transformations, juxtapositions, the shifts in levels of "reality"
that occurred throughout.'





I hope you'll check it out.

Very sad news to report.  Carl Rakosi died yesterday evening at his home in
San Francisco.  He was 100 years old.   Below is an excerpt from a piece
published in the UK journal Jewish Chronicle that I wrote about him on the
occasion of his 100th birthday.


CARL RAKOSI'S POETRY: REVERENCE AND ABUNDANCE

   Carl Rakosi, one of  our most valuable poets writing in English, will be
one hundred years old this coming November 6th.  He continues to write and
publish: a major collection of his poems, The Old Poet's Tale, came out in
1999, and a volume of poems is forthcoming.  Earlier this year, new work of
his appeared in the London Review of Books and in The American Poetry
Review, which published a sheaf of his recent poems along with a front
cover photo and interview. Rakosi is the last living survivor of
the  Objectivists, that small group of younger poets formed in the nineteen
thirties around Louis Zukofsky under the tutelage of William Carlos
Williams and Ezra Pound.  Its other founding members, all
of  American-Jewish background, included not only Zukofsky, but such major
American poets as Charles Reznikoff and George Oppen, who along with
Rakosi  reinvented American poetry not once but twice, in the early
nineteen-thirties and again in the latter half of the century when their
work was rediscovered by a new generation of younger poets....
         Rakosi's poetry, in its great depth, humor and compassion, remains
one of our most beautiful and enduring ceremonies of language.  His aim, as
he writes in his lovely poem, The China Policy, is to turn the universe
"into a poet's enclave."  His emphasis on clear seeing and accurate
language gives his poems a texture that is alive at all points, seeming to
lack nothing but our own responsiveness.  Our reading of his work, with its
visions of  utmost clarity, paradoxically draws us out of ourselves and
transforms us momentarily, and momentously.

Following up on Michael Heller's post about the death of Carl Rakosi, I
attach a notice from Tom Devaney.

********forwarded post from Tom Devaney***********
Poet Carl Rakosi died yesterday afternoon at the age of 100, after a series
of strokes, in his home in San Francisco. He was with his family and they
were reading Mark Twain and listening to music when he died.

He was a friend of the Writers House and a personal friend as well.

By way, probably, of Swahili, which incorporates a lot of arabic into an
east african grammar.

The Hebrew means "blessed" or "blessing."

“Some people think it must be French, but in France

1.
the psychology to not
treat everything as something else (If you have that),

then you can succeed. Sound is sound. So,
get a group of people
together with this concept, found
Chicago.

2.
“being on Estrus seemed like the end all, be all — I
guess the history of Coors includes some civil rights
atrocities — of what we're doing musically”




3.

(in which Hip hop will never be a verb like rock)


or if some hip hop artists say
this ain't hip hop and I'd say… I'd ask them
if it is still hip to say
hop! (laughs) you say you're still working
within the hip hop template or you a hip hop artist so
many rappers are trying their hand at singing. you
still gonna come out with hip hop every time,
regardless. Man this ain't hip hop but I like it
that's when hip hop happened, my mood changed, and
with the hip hop guys now “It's harder to make a
concept album.” 'Oooo I discovered rock, let me make a
hip hop rock record where I actually sing.'

All the kids that were listening to turbo folk now are
going to clubs, taking "E" and jumping all night long.


5.
This Moment in Black History. Kids need

6.
A POETICS OF CAPS. WE SING LIVE XXX AND IT’S OOUR REAL
VOICE.

7.
We have a lot of plans for this year. For starters,
we'll bring the Sofa Surfers and Manitoba to Belgrade.

8.
Pornography, or, the largest library of family
vacations ever. Or people taking massive shits on each
other: if that’s not too obvious (if you are
persistent enough).

9.
How I was made to shave me bush:
A bunch of mall metal kids at an indie-show saying
fuck porn, just give me a fucking hairy-bush or
something. I don’t care-you know what I mean?

Subject: Defeat of  President George W. Bush

I acknowledge that this topic falls short of being an appropriate =
subject matter on a site dedicated to the topic of poetry and poetic =
endeavors, yet I feel compelled to write to friends, family, colleagues =
and associates and express my fears and my views in the hope that I can =
sway you to take a specific action: vote in the coming election, and =
vote against George W. Bush.  More specifically, vote to defeat GWB by =
voting for whomever receives the Democratic Party's nomination.  =
(personal aside...I do not like John Kerry, but I dislike and distrust =
him less than his opponent)

I think our current President and his administration are doing the worst =
job of any presidency I have experienced in my life-time.  I feel the =
stature and reputation of the USA worldwide is at an all time low.  =
Abroad, Americans are embarrassed to identify themselves as Americans. =20

The president's decisions and actions have sunk the nation into a =
quagmire in Iraq for false reasons.  In my view, the main lack of =
intelligence, despite how Colin Powell tries to spin the issue, has been =
in the White House. =20

I don't think the United States as a nation can tolerate 4 more years of =
the secretive tactics and duplicity that we have been seeing from the =
current administration over the last 3 and a half years.

I hope that this letter won't alienate you from me since there are some =
out there who think I might actually be a Republican.  I am, and have =
been for many decades now.  I am a Republican because I believe in that =
Jeffersonian precept: "...that government is best which governs =
least..." =20

And it is the Bush administration's violation of that principal which =
drives my actions today and compels me to draft this note.=20

The Bush administration has shifted the emphasis of the Republican party =
from its goal of reducing the presence of government in the daily lives =
of our citizens to the extreme right. They invade the very privacies =
many of our citizens fought to protect and preserve.   =20

Despite what some non-Republicans may believe, not all Republicans vote =
as robots; most actually do give serious thought to their voter =
responsibilities and vote their conscience.=20
I do vote my conscience; I examine the record of candidates; I try to =
understand what positions they have taken in the past: where do they =
stand on important issues such as healthcare and aid to the poor and the =
disenfranchised, and where do they stand on environmental issues.  And =
for these days of America at war, where do they stand on the topic of =
invading independent nations in pre-emptive strikes.  =20

It is with clear conscience I ask you to join me in helping to defeat =
the Bush machine in its efforts to seek reelection.   Come November, =
vote, and vote for a candidate who actually has a chance of being =
elected...that means a candidate who has a chance of getting sufficient =
electoral college votes to become the next president of the United =
States. =20

And do not mistake my point here.  I do not mean to imply that =
Republicans will not vote as a strongly motivated block in this =
up-coming election...they will!  And many of the cross-over and =
independent voters too will join them in supporting the reelection bid =
of GWB. =20

And that is exactly why the vote you cast this coming November may well =
prove to be the most important vote you will ever cast in your lifetime. =
 Make it count, don't throw it away on a Green or a Libertarian or an =
American Independent Party candidate.

Thanks for indulging me here, and I hope you spread the word. =20
Alex

re: question about Amiri Baraka's name --

Baraka is benediction in Arabic -- often said as an invocation for good luck, or used the way we offhandedly say 'thank god' -- and pronounced (in Magrehbi Arabic) with the stress on the 1st syllable.

From CNN Website today:

George W. Bush
Hitler
Mussolini

NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge offered his "profound regret" Thursday for
saying President Bush's rise to power was similar to that of Mussolini and
Hitler.

Judge Guido Calabresi, 71, of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Manhattan, drew an audible gasp from lawyers attending Saturday's convention
of the American Constitution Society in Washington, according to the New
York Sun, which quoted the speech in Monday's editions.

"My remarks were extemporaneous and, in hindsight, reasonably could be --
and indeed have been -- understood to do something which I did not intend,
that is, take a partisan position," Calabresi wrote in a letter of apology
to Chief Judge John Walker.

Calabresi, a former dean of Yale Law School, was quoted saying the U.S.
Supreme Court "put somebody in power" when a ruling it made in December 2000
settled the dispute over whether Bush had defeated Al Gore.

"In a way that occurred before but is rare in the United States ... somebody
came to power as a result of the illegitimate acts of a legitimate
institution that had the right to put somebody in power," Calabresi said.
"The reason I emphasize that is because that is exactly what happened when
Mussolini was put in by the king of Italy.

"The King of Italy had the right to put Mussolini in, though he had not won
an election, and make him prime minister," the judge continued. "That is
what happened when Hindenburg put Hitler in."

Calabresi told the lawyers: "I am not suggesting for a moment that Bush is
Hitler. I want to be clear on that, but it is a situation which is extremely
unusual."

Calabresi went on to say the public should expel Bush from office to cleanse
the democratic system. "That's got nothing to do with the politics of it.
It's got to do with the structural reassertion of democracy," Calabresi was
quoted saying.

In his letter of apology, Calabresi said he was "deeply sorry" for remarks
that were meant as "a rather complicated academic argument about the nature
of re-elections after highly contested original elections" -- but that were
"too easily taken as partisan."

"That is something which judges should do their best to avoid, and there, I
clearly failed," he wrote.

In a letter to the rest of the appeals judges, Walker said Calabresi's
"off-the-cuff" comments had been viewed as a call to oppose Bush's
re-election. He warned them to refrain from political activity or public
endorsements because partisan political comments violate the Code of
Judicial Conduct.

Ok: Thanks to everyone who responded. I did finally find a Hebrew
dictionary (results appended below). It was my understanding that the
root of word literally meant 'bended knee' or 'to kneel' (& by
implication, to bless God). So it means to "set yourself," "stand
still," and "see the Lord with you [ie. to see salvation as
consequence]" or physically: "to bow [one's] head with face to the
ground in worship of the Lord" (2Chron.20:17-18)  i guess like you see
muslims doing when they get down on their knees + bend forward with head
touching the ground to pray.

I understand there are 3 words the writers of the OT used to indicate
praise for God: barak ('to kneel in praise'), hala ('to boast/shine in
praise' as in 'hallelujah') and yadah ('to cry out or sing out in
praise'). So baraka, to me, should mean -- taking the root
barak+jah=baraka -- 'to bless jah/yahweh' in the particular manner of
the physical act of 'bending the knee'. I wonder if this is what Amiri
believes his last name means?


i also wonder if the trend for hostage-taking terrorists to have their
hostages before them 'on bended knee' and blindfolded (presumably so
they can see) is 'a blessing in disguise' so that if the poor hostages
would just fear not, nor be dismayed, they would not need to fight since
they recognize the battle is not with them, but with God (2Chron.20:15).
The so-called terrorists claim to understand this bit.

The way the Korean boy screamed out in fear and obvious dismay may have
been a slip-up at the-moment-of-truth so-to-speak and may have caused
him to experience re-birth because it seemed to me, looking in from the
outside as we are, that he wasn't established.

I wonder what would happen if the american army pulled out some 'barak'
and by consequence 'hala' and 'yadah' (dance before song! ~ there is an
obvious progression from barak thru to hala and yadah) -- if that then
wouldn't achieve the same accomplishment of 2Chron20.1-26? ah ha or ha
ha?



barak (baw-rak'): a primitive root; to kneel; by implication to bless
God (as an act of adoration), and (vice-versa) man (as a benefit); also
(by euphemism) to curse (God or the king, as treason):--X abundantly, X
altogether, X at all, blaspheme, bless, congratulate, curse, X greatly,
X indeed, kneel (down), praise, salute, X still, thank.


halal (haw-lal'): a primitive root; to be clear (orig. of sound, but
usually of color); to shine; hence, to make a show, to boast; and thus
to be (clamorously) foolish; to rave; causatively, to celebrate; also to
stultify:--(make) boast (self), celebrate, commend, (deal, make), fool(-
ish, -ly), glory, give (light), be (make, feign self) mad (against),
give in marriage, (sing, be worthy of) praise, rage, renowned, shine.


yadah (yaw-daw'): a primitive root; used only as denominative from
'yad'; literally, to use (i.e. hold out) the hand; physically, to throw
(a stone, an arrow) at or away; especially to revere or worship (with
extended hands); intensively, to bemoan (by wringing the hands):--cast
(out), (make) confess(-ion), praise, shoot, (give) thank(-ful, -s,
-sgiving).



i guess looking at yadah that that's how we got 'yada yada yada' which
indicates excessive 'out-ness' . . . ? maybe that's what i'm doing here,
still guessing ;-)

amphetamine vs. antihistamine

This one is especially embarrassing when I've had to take a lot of the
latter for my asthma, and I'm trying to explain why I'm so loopy at that
moment.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

I researched salary statistics for WRITER working in New York and suburban
Minneapolis (using a program called Salary Expert ePro) and found out the
following:

I typed in "20" for years of experience and "0" for current salary.  The top
three skills I listed are:

Skill 1: Write stories
Skill 2: Edit stories
Skill 3: Design narratives

Then the program asked me (for New York) to define the mathematical skills
required for "writer," and I selected level 4 (on a scale of 1-7, where 1 is
simplest and 7 is most complex):  "Compute, discount, interest, profit and loss;
commission markup, and selling price, ratio proportion, and percentage.
Calculate surfaces, volumes, weights, and measures.  Algebra: Calculate variables
and formulas, monomials and polynomials; ration and proportion variables, and
square roots and radicals.  Geometry: Calculate plane and solid features,
circumference, area, and volume."

5) Crouching -- How often does "writer" require crouching?

I selected "occasionally" (thinking of checking lower bookshelves).

6) Following detailed instructions:

"Occasionally."

For Wayzata, Minnesota (I entered zip code 55391 for nearby Deephaven), the
program asked me to define the language skills required for "writer" (on a
scale of 1 to 7); I selected 7: "Reading: Read literature, book and play reviews,
scientific and technical journals, abstracts, financial reports, and legal
documents.  Writing: Write novels, plays, editorials, journals, speeches,
manuals, critiques, poetry, and songs.  Speaking: Conversant in the theory,
principles, and methods of effective and persuasive speaking, votive and diction,
phonetics, and discussion and debate."

5) Crawling -- how often does this job require crawling?

(Not present)

6) Concentration and attention:

"Frequently"

When I tried this another time, the program asked (for New York) if "writer"
required stooping, and for Eden Prairie, Minnesota, whether it required
kneeling.

Here are the salary results (given for Wayzata/Deephaven, Minnesota in
parentheses):

"The WRITER working in New York-Manhattan, New York, United States of America
now earns $48,694 ($36,254).  50% of those in this position would earn
between $33,492 ($24,935) and $54,425 ($40,521) (the 17th and 67th percentiles).
These numbers are derived from real, area specific, survey data.  Average Total
Compensation would be $58,324 ($44,338).  The average earner would have an
equivalent "Renters' Buying Power" of $34,479 ($40,504)."

Subject:      Some naïve questions about (English) poetics.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

1 Insofar as poetry is a kind of creative violence
enacted on the institution(s) of language, isn’t it
most at home in the ghetto? (And what happens when the
ghetto is more institutionalized than anyplace else?)

2 Given the ongoing colonization of the world’s
tongues by the English language and the predominance
of English as **the** language of global capital, is
it possible to write in English in good faith?

3 Is the fact that English Literature departments in
N. America have become a de-fault refuge for “radical”
(politicized) thought in an institutional/public
context, to some extent, a case of guilt-induced
bad-faith? (How should ESL students fare in English
courses? Should their work be assessed on the same
lines as first-language students – does anyone else
struggle w/ this question?)


4. What is to be gained and what lost in granting
poetry and poetics the status of intellectual/social
labour?

If poetry and poetics – writing, criticism,
publishing, translation – are not forms of labour (as
some argue, at least about the writing), don’t they
remain predicated on a labour that is always already
elsewhere? – whether one’s day job or the tax-base on
which grants and teaching positions depend. Isn’t
poetry simply another leisure activity, like golf,
origami, crossword puzzles, and garage bands? A tool
of sublimation and another instance of the
ghettoization of the everyday? If yes, is this good,
do we like it this way?


5 Is google-based poetry the work of mere DJs or
‘real’ poets?

And why is the distance my sources are from
sites/contexts which are preconceived as literary, so
important to the merit/originality of my work? As
though if I build a table out of other tables, it’s
not as much of a table as one fashioned from more
‘raw’ materials.



If I want to build a poem out of phrases taken from
google searches, nobody much cares, but if I build a
poem out of phrases pulled exclusively from previously
published poems, it’s plagiarism. Why? Because someone
else, another mind, has already done the labour ?

If I have the time and capacity to write poetry at
all, it’s b/c someone else doesn’t have that liberty.

I read this--with some hesitancy--as an ironic pun referring to the urban
ghetto and its actual violence. If that's an appropriate reading, then the
naivete of these questions is based on a linguistic slide. Violence in real
life is not, of course, violence against language, though the urban ghetto
is somewhat institutionalized: a space in a larger urban context practically
set aside for poor people and the troubles they bring.

But poetry today is ghettoized. It exists almost exlclusively in
universities and--in a grand attempt to de-ghettoize poetry--on slam poetry
stages. And that, too, is an institutional ghetto: the ghetto of the
institute, and the closer you get to contemporary poetry the deeper you walk
into the ghetto.

Why not? Was English any more difficult to justify during manifest destiny
and English colonialism? Did Roman poets have to justify writing in Latin
when Caesar--any Caesar--was expanding the empire? I'm sure Ovid didn't
consider halting his writing because of using a tainted language. I know
little about Latin poetry, but I imagine that he may have viewed his
writings as a way to cleanse the language of its excesses, just as writers
in English in the 20th century have wanted to cleanse English.

The real problems come in so-called colonial literature written in English.
What does English do for Rushdie or Soyinka or Heaney that it doesn't do for
Sylvia Plath?

ESL students should be given some slack, I suppose, in terms of grammar and
phraseology, but I also believe that high demands produce high results. And
of course, this isn't what you mean in terms of assessment of work of ESL
students, is it? But anyway, what's in bad-faith about being radical and
also being in the university? Just because you're a leftist doesn't mean you
have to work in a factory, does it? Isn't teaching, isn't writing, some kind
of labor, on a similar footing with the assembly line? And aren't so many of
us in the university--students, professors, adjuncts,
janitors--disenfranchised just as Marx said we'd be?

what is to be gained: respect for writing, perhaps an end to its
marginalization, ghettoization, an end to any shame in saying "I'm a poet"
any more than saying "I'm a mechanic".

What is to be lost: the notion that many jobs are more strenuous.

what is the ghettoization of the everyday, other than an overuse of the term
"ghettoization"?

most of us believe that originality and value are entwined. Perhaps this has
to do with a Benjamaniacal aura or mystique we want art to have. perhaps
it's again related to labor: we don't think you're working hard enough if
you're just copying. Even if copying itself is an art form ("bad poets
imitate; good poets steal" is a good quote, even if I'm sure it's a
misquote, from T. S. Eliot).

right.

But not exactly.

In the west plagiarism depends not only on using someone else's labor, but
on taking credit for it yourself. If you assume--as the modernists did--that
the reader recognizes the sources, then it isn't plagiarism. If you assume
that the reader doesn't recognize the reference and credits you with the
originality, and then you get caught, that's when they call the deans.

Pierre Menard, author of the Quixote, was not a plagiarist.

Bob Dylan: "steal a little and they put you in jail / steal a lot and they
make you king"

but I still don't think it's a matter of distance, but of attitude. A
translator is a translator when he or she acknowledges the act of
translation, a poet when he or she calls it imitation, and either an
academic poet or a plagiarist when he or she doesn't acknowledge it at all.
The distance is always the same. Clayton Eshleman's upper-paleolithic is
more removed than Gary Snyder's Pacific Northwest mountains, but that
doesn't make Snyder less of a poet.

> 7. What's the difference between stealing an idea and

intellectual property is total nonsense (do I contradict myself? very well,
I contradict myself).

Is it a coincidence that intellectual property laws come up most often these
days when talking about China, a country whose civilization gave great
respect to those who could quote the best? But references in classical
Chinese poetry are like references in Ulysses or The Cantos: you assume
they're there, even when no one comes out and says for sure. The tradition
was more stable, and the people who could read did read, and there weren't
many of them anyway, so if Li Bai takes a line from Qu Yuan then everyone
knows that he's taking a line from Qu Yuan. And if Wang Wei retells the same
story as Tao Yuanming, everyone knows he's telling the same story as Tao
Yuanming. Today we have footnotes for that. Then they had education.

Perhaps the point of education is to create something on your own, to add to
what is given to you. This might be the western response to "what's the
difference between stealing an idea and stealing a distinct order of words?"
I'm sure we all know that you can do a lot with words, with changing their
meaning, even if we maintain their order.

But in the Chinese tradition--when there wasn't really "stealing ideas" or
"stealing words"--using an ancient's words could boost your own ideas, and
words, and turn them into something greater than they would be without the
ancient's contribution. Like a blurb on the back of a book, rather than a
trial surrounding it.

Do we all assume we agree about everything, so we don't mention it? Aren't
all our ideas so reasonable anyone else should agree? Why bring it up if we
all agree, even if we don't really agree?

The terminology of "language as creative violence" is one that I myself am
not familiar with -- brings to mind people who think the language is being
polluted / violated . . . . I doubt it's a dominant one. Suggesting that
poetry would be at home in the ghetto because it is...violent? (Classist?)
Or at home in the ghetto because the ghetto is anti-instutional (this point,
you yourself counter with the suggestion that the ghetto is an institution.)

Well, you could say that this makes English an imperialistic language,
becasue it has been inflicted as  product of imperialism. Or, you could say
that so many different peoples now speak English that the language now
encompasses various culture/histories and that all of these people are
contained within English -- to say that English is the language of the
conqueror at this point would be inaccurate as the British / Americans /
Australians  / Canadians etc are far from the only writers in an anglophone
tongue.

Isn't it just as pompous to assume that any other country's home language
would be our own?

In my opinion, in high school (public school) it is the job of the school to
lift up the student in the areas in which they are behind. One cannot expect
the child to have the personal iniative of an adult.  We all enter the
public school system at around the same age (if we are born here), attend
the same number of grades, etc.  College is necessarily built to be not an
"equal playing ground" in the same way - for example, everyone does not
enter any given college, but a certain track record is required. Some people
enter after high school, others enter after 20 years of being a mechanic, 22
years after taking their last Algebra class.  In college, in adulthood, it
is the job of the students themselves to compensate for any deficiencies
they might have by remedials, etc.  This is because it is imperative that
people can do their jobs correctly - for instance, a doctor needs to have
certain knowledges, as does a lawyer - and an English teacher is just the
same.   To allow people to pass on lower standards because they didn't learn
English previously is to allow poorer students to become doctors, lawyers,
etc . . . . College is not based on effort - while a mentally-handicapped
person might have special needs that are met in public school (or not met as
they are) and special needs, to graduate with a bachelor's degree from any
given school any person who wishes to graduate - mentally hadnicapped or
otherwise - must be able to complete given courses.  A college degree is not
a right - should it be?

I would argue the only difference between leisure activities & "a career" is
the demand -- not necessarily anythign that has to do with value,
dedication, etc -- just plain demand. If suddenly an origami fad breaks out,
the origami folder may become an origami instructor. So it is/would be with
poetry.  What is or isn't a job has nothign to do about whether it's "actual
work" -- whether it's difficult, it's serious, it involves labor -- it is an
economic designation.


Anyone who would claim that poetry is not labor (in my opinion) knows
nothing of poetry - it is obvious to any poet or student of English that
poetry is of a complex nature, not something one does while watching TV and
eating a donut.

Word-clumps and words are materials alike, just as are the printed matter of
the collage maker and the paint of the oil painter.  I think it depends on
the content - depends if something is truly gained by any paritcular
arrangement or comibination of the texts.

I agree with Lucas - probably has to do with originality, and probably even
more so the amount of labor involved.  The less "poemy" or literary the text
is, the more labor needed to transform it into your own work.

To me this could be construed several ways:
-- that you are not laboring, and therefore, living off products of other
people's labor (I personally believe that intellectual/social labor is still
labor and thus one can consider oneself self-sufficient)
-- because you are in a developed country, underlying the products you
consume etc etc is slave labor, child labor, and all sorts of imperialistic
horrors - this would obviously be no less true if you were a mechanic, you'd
still be eating the same things and using the same gasoline, etc.

I think intellectual property is nonsense. Stealing an arrangement of words
is legally provable, while "stealing an ideal" is a much less tangible
concept. I think generally the main times when we need to deal with this
particular concept are matters of conscience.

1 Insofar as poetry is a kind of creative violence

most at home in the ghetto? (And what happens when the
ghetto is more institutionalized than anyplace else?)
I'm afraid you have matters reversed.  Poetry is creative violence =
enacted upon the poet by the language.  Therefore, your conclusion is =
inaccurate, neither social status nor place of residence protect the =
poet from the pain of producing nor the pain from rejection.=20
2 Given the ongoing colonization of the world's
tongues by the English language and the predominance
of English as **the** language of global capital, is
it possible to write in English in good faith?
Globalization of any language does not prohibit users of the language =
from doing so with honesty and candor.  Globalization and Honesty in =
expression are not mutually exclusive conditions.  Poets writing in any =
language, even in techno-speak may, if they choose write honestly and =
candidly.  Can there be any better example of attempting to communicate =
in good faith?  That, and remember, all languages are merely tools =
created to facilitate communication...having been developed by humans, =
language is not perfect.  The flaws in creation result directly from the =
flaws in the language systems, English or any other.  More, the best =
poets...I.e. the most honest are those who challenge the traditions =
within their language and work to expand the horizons of the language =
itself in order to communicate more clearly and concisely with other =
humans.=20
3 Is the fact that English Literature departments in
N. America have become a de-fault refuge for "radical"
(politicized) thought in an institutional/public
context, to some extent, a case of guilt-induced
bad-faith? (How should ESL students fare in English
courses? Should their work be assessed on the same
lines as first-language students - does anyone else
struggle w/ this question?)
No; E. L. depts are now, as they have been throughout my entire =
lifetime, the safe haven for the lazy. There is nothing political in the =
choice at all.   It was the lure of not having to lift heavy weights nor =
work in mud, oil and grease, or smelly fishy things that drew me to the =
faculty arena, and E.L. was the easiest way to get the degree.  Face it, =
in liberal arts, you don't have to walk around with a PDA (sliderule in =
my day), and you never have to make any effort to understand complex =
subjects such as Calculus or Quantum Physics...you need only remember =
titles, names, dates, forms, and silly metrical stanzaic forms and =
patterns.   =20

 And the development of ESL programs was merely a way for the E.L. =
faculty members to expand their arena and open their private haven to =
some of their two-language literate friends.   I admire that.=20

4. What is to be gained and what lost in granting
poetry and poetics the status of intellectual/social
labour?
Nothing at all, so why do it?=20
If poetry and poetics - writing, criticism,
publishing, translation - are not forms of labour (as
some argue, at least about the writing), don't they
remain predicated on a labour that is always already
elsewhere? - whether one's day job or the tax-base on
which grants and teaching positions depend. Isn't
poetry simply another leisure activity, like golf,
origami, crossword puzzles, and garage bands? A tool
of sublimation and another instance of the
ghettoization of the everyday? If yes, is this good,
do we like it this way?

Poetry is not "intellectual"; it is a craft exactly the same as =
cabinetry.  A cabinet maker improves over time spent with the tools =
building cabinets...the poet too must spend time with the tools of the =
trade building poems. =20

In some corners of the universe there is a notion that poetry is the =
province of the literate; there in lies the problem.  Poetry was the =
province of the people who speak the language.  In civilized Western =
cultures however, poetry has unfortunately been usurped from the people =
by professors who confined to the hallowed halls for study.

One should not study poetry; one should write it, or speak it, or read =
it, or best of all, one should hear it spoken, whispered or shouted, or =
even sung slightly off-key and somewhat discordant. =20

5 Is google-based poetry the work of mere DJs or
'real' poets?
I know of the google search engine, but I'm unfamiliar with the verse it =
"creates?"  I'd appreciate some instruction on how I might familiarize =
myself with the stuff.=20
And why is the distance my sources are from
sites/contexts which are preconceived as literary, so
important to the merit/originality of my work? As
though if I build a table out of other tables, it's
not as much of a table as one fashioned from more
'raw' materials.



If I want to build a poem out of phrases taken from
google searches, nobody much cares, but if I build a
poem out of phrases pulled exclusively from previously
published poems, it's plagiarism. Why? Because someone
else, another mind, has already done the labour ?

If I have the time and capacity to write poetry at
all, it's b/c someone else doesn't have that liberty.
My poems always owe their existence to another's
labour/exploitation.

It's as if what's most important is the distance of
the labour base from the final product.
Institutionalized theft - corporate subsidies, unfair
trade etc (the free market) - is thus validated while
direct, honest theft is subject to legal action.

7. What's the difference between stealing an idea and
stealing a distinct arrangement/order of words?
Is(n't) intellectual property total nonsense?
Intellectual property is the creation of the Capitalist money mongers; =
it's as real an idea as the concept that little slips of paper printed =
with pictures of old dead guys has value.

8. Do people on this list agree about most things that
matter to poets or is the total lack of discussion and
debate on the list simply the (understandable) result
of energies being spent elsewhere right now?
I have over the past many months read a good many comments on the site; =
too often though, the comments seemed to be more personal attacks than =
critical analysis of a point.  But that too is valid commentary, =
assuming it doesn't lead to punches in the nose. =20

I think it’s quite common to understand metre, rhyme,
enjambment, and various poetic techniques as
‘instruments of violence’ following the Russian
formalists, no?

-Specifically I’d cite:

1.Viktor Shklovsky’s discussion of the “roughening” of
everyday speech in “Art as Technique.”

2.Mukarovsky in  __On Poetic Language__ :



Renewal in poetic language appears, both with respect
to the previous developmental period and in comparison
with the norm of the literary language, as a certain
violence against language, and therefore one speaks
about the deformational character of poetic language.
It is, however, necessary to use this term, albeit a
rather telling one, carefully.  Only in some schools
and in some developmental periods is it a matter of
apparent violence tending toward real destruction or
at least toward a loosening of the previous forms of
poetic expression or the forms of normal literary
communication.  At other times deviations from poetic
tradition or from literary usage are less discernible,
being instead only a special application of a given
means of expression.  It is even possible that in some
periods (and also in some literary genres) a
considerable approximation of the poetic and literary
languages may take place so that the impression of the
deviation of poetic expression almost vanishes, and
poetic genres stand undifferentiated in close
proximity to the communicative genres of literature.
This happens especially when both parties meet head-on
in the middle of the road, that is, when the language
of communicative literature takes on a strong
aesthetic coloration.  We see such a state of affairs
particularly during periods of classicism, and this is
the desire of all classicistically-minded
theoreticians.  None of these states—neither the
greatest mutual separation of the literary and poetic
languages, nor their maximal approximation, nor,
finally, the golden mean—is, however, a permanent
ideal, for poetic language is constant change.

3. Jean-Jacques Lecercle in __The Violence of
Language__:

Language is no longer a mere instrument, it seems to
have acquired a life of its own. Language speaks, it
follows its own rhythms, its own partial coherence, it
proliferates in apparent, sometimes, violent, chaos. .
. There is another side to language, one that escapes
the linguist's attention, not because of his temporary
failure or failings, but for necessary reasons. This
dark side emerges in nonsensical and poetic texts, in
the illumination of mystics and the delirium of
logophiliacs or mental patients. . . . I have called
it "the remainder"

What is "the" ghetto? And why "violence" - why not caress or intervention?

Again, why violence?

Why couple poetry and poets with honesty? What does honesty have to do
with poetry at all?

Of course it's labor and intellectual labor is labor, even since Adrian
Piper and Seth Siegelaub at least recognized this in the 70s.

And of course poetry is intellectual as is cabinet-making; having known a
number of cabinet-makers, I can attest to this. But poetry begins with a
blank field at times, as with art; cabinet-making begins with function and
design, as does industrial design and advertising.

Poetry is the province of no one.

Why shouldn't one study it? And cabinet-making for that matter?

No, because intellectual property is labor.

Well, most people wouldn't agree certainly with me, and probably not with

Subject: Some naïve questions about (English) poetics.


1 Insofar as poetry is a kind of creative violence
enacted on the institution(s) of language, isn't it
most at home in the ghetto? (And what happens when the
ghetto is more institutionalized than anyplace else?)



A: If you mean a ghetto of the spirit, like Spicer's English Dept.,

that sounds like one place among many marginalizations that

might function (however de facto) as a "home" for poetry-but

as a "most at home" situation? That smacks of special pleading.

The 'ghetto' you feel yourself in, even stuck in, yeah, but not

where you pay rent to The Man. Quite the contrary. Remember:

'ghetto' means 'arsenal.'


2 Given the ongoing colonization of the world's
tongues by the English language and the predominance
of English as **the** language of global capital, is
it possible to write in English in good faith?



 A: You write in good faith if you write in good faith. If some,

afflicted with selective deafness, can't hear that, it says

nothing about the author's intention ('good faith'). Does

English 'colonize'? No: 'the yap is not the territory.'

3 Is the fact that English Literature departments in
N. America have become a de-fault refuge for "radical"
(politicized) thought in an institutional/public
context, to some extent, a case of guilt-induced
bad-faith? (How should ESL students fare in English
courses? Should their work be assessed on the same
lines as first-language students - does anyone else
struggle w/ this question?)



A: Well, yes (and, well, yes). As a professor and associate

chair of English in a very 'diverse' college, I've witnessed

a multi-year war between my department and ESL-still

unresolved-about 'standards.' ESL (and some of my

colleagues) lean toward leniency; I disagree, and push a

Standard American English model, assuming that my

students should strive to 'level the playing field' as soon

as possible by eliminating the 'noise' of idiolect in writing.


4. What is to be gained and what lost in granting
poetry and poetics the status of intellectual/social
labour?

If poetry and poetics - writing, criticism,
publishing, translation - are not forms of labour (as
some argue, at least about the writing), don't they
remain predicated on a labour that is always already
elsewhere? - whether one's day job or the tax-base on
which grants and teaching positions depend. Isn't
poetry simply another leisure activity, like golf,
origami, crossword puzzles, and garage bands? A tool
of sublimation and another instance of the
ghettoization of the everyday? If yes, is this good,
do we like it this way?



A: "Isn't poetry simply another leisure activity?"

Not for me. I work 2 ½  jobs, so I have no leisure.

I don't exploit anyone in those jobs (indeed, teaching

a full load-plus-of adjunct courses for 25 years at 1/3

of full-time pay numbers me among the exploited). The

fact that my salary comes from somewhere doesn't mean

I don't work for it. CEOs who make an average of 600

times the salary of an average worker certainly exploit

the system; teachers, who make less than other professionals,

simply don't. What poets write for money, anyhow? Maya

Angelou for Hallmark cards? For me, poetry proposes a

wholly different economy, one not based on the 'full faith

and credit' of any particular national entity.

5 Is google-based poetry the work of mere DJs or
'real' poets?

And why is the distance my sources are from
sites/contexts which are preconceived as literary, so
important to the merit/originality of my work? As
though if I build a table out of other tables, it's
not as much of a table as one fashioned from more
'raw' materials.

If I want to build a poem out of phrases taken from
google searches, nobody much cares, but if I build a
poem out of phrases pulled exclusively from previously
published poems, it's plagiarism. Why? Because someone
else, another mind, has already done the labour ?

If I have the time and capacity to write poetry at
all, it's b/c someone else doesn't have that liberty.
My poems always owe their existence to another's
labour/exploitation.

It's as if what's most important is the distance of
the labour base from the final product.
Institutionalized theft - corporate subsidies, unfair
trade etc (the free market) - is thus validated while
direct, honest theft is subject to legal action.



A: To the extent that readers still believe in authors (most

haven't heard of the author's 'death'), they legitimately

expect to read the views of a specific individual. To cheat

them of that entitlement does not consort with integrity.

However much institutions thieve, we need not 'become

what we behold,' as Blake said. "My poems always owe

their existence to another's labour/exploitation." To use

this belief as an excuse to mirror it indulges in the

'bandwagon' fallacy.


7. What's the difference between stealing an idea and
stealing a distinct arrangement/order of words?
Is(n't) intellectual property total nonsense?

A: If you don't know the difference, wait until someone

steals your words or ideas and represents them as his or her

own. Do you have a lawyer? Do you own a gun?


8. Do people on this list agree about most things that
matter to poets or is the total lack of discussion and
debate on the list simply the (understandable) result
of energies being spent elsewhere right now?



A: I don't claim to possess psychic powers.

I think I understand now... I understand language as "deformation", as
alteration, as rearrangement, deconstruction, if that is the road you are
going down.

"and in some developmental periods is it a matter of apparent violence
tending toward real destruction or
at least toward a loosening of the previous forms of poetic expression or
the forms of normal literary
communication.  "

(((I'm not sure I like the term "violence":


  1.. Physical force exerted for the purpose of violating, damaging, or
abusing: crimes of violence.
  2.. The act or an instance of violent action or behavior.
  3.. Intensity or severity, as in natural phenomena; untamed force: the
violence of a tornado.
  4.. Abusive or unjust exercise of power.
  5.. Abuse or injury to meaning, content, or intent: do violence to a text.
  6.. Vehemence of feeling or expression; fervor.
Alteration / deconstruction as violating, as abusing, as injury... i would
say that my personal love for language and that I see in almost all poets I
know compells me
to say that what tehy are doing is not violence.. Anyhow, to continue)))

"It is even possible that in some periods (and also in some literary genres)
a considerable approximation of the poetic and literary
languages may take place so that the impression of the deviation of poetic
expression almost vanishes, and
poetic genres stand undifferentiated in close proximity to the communicative
genres of literature"

So if it is highly differentiated, it is violence? Am I following you?
I do love your LeCercle quote though.  Semantics, semantics.

Llike Lucas, I felt that I totally didn't understand your " violence --->
ghetto"
connection. It made it seem like perhaps you meant violence in a more
literal way, or were making an interesting joke.
And the quotes you put to explain how you made that connection didn't seem
to help. Could you say more?

You can write in English as if it were a foreign language.

As I said, to a poet writing in English, English is a foreign language. I go=

Writing poetry -at least in The United States where poetry has zero economic=
=20
value- writing poetry is not labor but consumption. The poet consumes time t=
o=20
write.

This consumption is differrent from leisure (or vacation). In leisure, the=20
assumption is that you rest to become a better producer. No such link exists=
=20
with poetry. The poet has to steal time from labor to write; in that sense p=
oetry=20
is anti-labor (or a bizzaro version of it) or, as I said in another occasion=
,=20
a poet is like an addict, whose activity affects negatively his/her ability=20
to do productive labor.

>=20
I think, rather, the poet basically exploits himself/herself as a laborer,=20
particularly, if he/she wants to write seeing English as a foreign language.

Poetic or philosophical ideas can not be stolen because they are not=20
property, not being products of labor. They are the detritus of mental and s=
piritual=20
consumption, free for everyone to take.

I hope this helps.

Please b/c if you know of poems based on paintings (or paintings based on
poems). I'm particularly interested in series, e.g. Williams' series of
poems based on Brueghel paintings.

Early in my search, there's the Robert Creeley and Archie Rand
collaboration, Drawn & Quartered, MarkYoung's excellent on-going series
based on Magritte, John Yau and Archie Rand, Bob Perelman and Francie Shaw,
many of John Ashbery and Frank O'Hara's poems (probably many others, too,
from the New York school). I recall, too, some poems by Bill Berkson.
Others?

I'm compiling a bibliography and am considering dedicating a future issue of
SPORE (formerly SCORE) to ekphrastic lit.

Is this true? Is poetry ghettoized? Maybe a kind of
poetry is, but I see and hear poetry of all kinds
being chanted and used in various ways every day by
all kinds of people. Just walk over to the
playgrounds, for instance, and give a listen to the
kids skip roping, or choosing up sides in a game, or
warding off linguistic attacks ("I'm rubber you're

language play the name poetry. I wouldn't.

Sure, that's poetry. Or more precisely, there's poetry in it. If we talk
about cutting art from high school curricula, no one defends it by saying
that students doodling in class is enough to promote their creativity. There
is art in graphic design, but reading glossy magazines with good layout is
not an experience with art. Hearing clever rhymes might be experiencing
children at the beginning of a lifelong experience with poetry, but it isn't
experiencing poetry in itself.

Is it?

O'Neil will take you
to Elyria Avenue. Meanwhile,
red-eyed towers creep by. They're
up late. You swing your arms
with a mountain dew. Caffeine
twists your belly
into a balloon animal
so shrill. Pop, then Xanax. Caspians

sabotage to rust these knees
I step on, cracking
until a low yellow moon
casts webs down to smoking earth
that look like fences
around nameless bricks. Because

you wear no underwear, the black pants
feel seamless and delicious on you
when there's a breeze.

Fattening, these catastrophes: though
complex metaphors elude my grip, as if
finches on a palpitating underground cable
have yet to eat, and eat they must; you,
my dear, look lovely, even in the backyard
as I sit quietly even softly contemplating
some new way to do everything at once.

You must have seen me there. Weren't you
chilled? A left-handed compliment may not
know what the right hand is doing. But,
back then you told me what you needed:
my dead cold lips. New aim. I'm the one
struggling in the leaves, crushing stars
into my favorite white dust. It's more
like off-white, don't you think?

Lucas, I don't understand a great deal about what you're saying.

I think that the term ghettoized is an overdramatization, I really do, and I
always have although I've met so many fond of using it. It makes it sound
like it's an intentional shunting from society, an oppression of some sort.
I think the truth is the world has just moved its interests elsewhere -- the
stupider the media the better -- and poetry is the hardest to convert into
multimedia, into movies, to experience without thinking -- it's more
interactive, it needs listening or reading and doesn't just jump off at
you. It's just so-not-twentieth century.

To those who say we are "ghettoized", who created this ghetto?

> writings as a way to cleanse the language of its excesses, just as writers
> in English in the 20th century have wanted to cleanse English.

I'm sorry, maybe I'm not aware of any theories on anything (quote possible,
I'm ignorant re: poetics) but how does one cleanse English?

> of labor, on a similar footing with the assembly line? And aren't so many

also -- again i am ignorant -- how are professors disenfranchised?

> marginalization, ghettoization, an end to any shame in saying "I'm a poet"
> any more than saying "I'm a mechanic".

for godsakes, the shame isn't that bad.
it's not liek we have a "poet closet" to come out of.

> What is to be lost: the notion that many jobs are more strenuous.

I don't understand: are you saying this is true or false?

term
> "ghettoization"?

huh??

> most of us believe that originality and value are entwined. Perhaps this

personally, i think think this is pretty straightforward: we want art to be
the production
of something new, and that creation, that innovation, is a large part of
what separates
art from simple production

i think this theory is incomplete though -- i think who you steal from
matters.
if its someone no one would care to recognize, ie, i stole this from the
koolaid
commercial, then one isn't a plagiarist.  you can quote a whole chapter of
the
bible if you want to.  but even if everyone knows shakespare, how would
someone
feel if you put 4 lines of shakespeare into your poem? it seems more complex
to me.

I think poetry is no more or less twentieth century--or twenty-first
century--than it is eighteenth or tenth century. I'm pretty sure we have
similar numbers of poets running around today as we did a hundred years ago,
five hundred years ago. And certainly poetry changes to fit the times. But
as you say, the stupider the media the better. "You can never go broke
under-estimating the taste of the American public", said P. T. Barnum. He
was right. The problem (if you want to call it a problem) is that poetry has
a relatively lower status because of the relatively higher status of
everything else. Before film and television, before the NBA and NFL, before
game shows, literature was given more relative respect. This isn't to say
that sports and acting and people with a flair for showing off their
intelligence didn't take up their space before, but I think it's a little
more noticeable now, and as a result poetry is a little less noticeable. On
top of that, things in the world move so fast that most people would rather
spend the little time they have in front of a screen than in front of a page
(and if that includes computer screens, maybe it includes myself, as well).
So where is literature today? Looking at shrinking book-review sections in
newspapers, literary journals that struggle to find subscribers, and
bookstores that depend on self-help or finance books to turn a profit rather
than on staff recommendations (because the staff don't recommend what they
don't read), I think we can say that literature has lost a lot of its
prominence. The people who really care about literature are in various
departments of universities, for the most part. There's nothing good or bad
about this in & of itself. On the one hand, it means that the people who
care about literature are all at the same place. On the other hand, it means
we're all talking to ourselves, without the benefit of cross-breezes to
clear the air in here.

Ghettoization is probably an overdramatization, as you say. I didn't pick
the term. I responded to how it was being used in the original question,
which I found unclear (I didn't know if it was being used as a concrete noun
or as a metaphor). Nevertheless, I think of the ghetto as related but not
the same as an urban slum. I think of it more in terms of Jewish ghettos in
Europe in the thirties. And if poetry today in north america exists in a
ghetto, it exists in the kind of ghetto where it can have its own
semi-comfortable life amongst others who care about poetry, but outside the
walls of that ghetto is a world often hostile to its concerns. Outside the
walls of this ghetto is a world, as you say, of stupid media, of experience
without thinking. And those within the ghetto, however comfortable we feel
within, exist with full knowledge of the environment just outside.

> To those who say we are "ghettoized", who created this ghetto?

well, perhaps we did. A ghetto is also a community. But perhaps it's a
community forced upon us, and any decision to move inside is to some extent
a compelled decision.

> I'm sorry, maybe I'm not aware of any theories on anything (quote
possible,
> I'm ignorant re: poetics) but how does one cleanse English?

I'm thinking of early modernist writing along the lines of Ezra Pound and
the like. He talked a lot about purifying the language of the tribe, and
writing that meant something. He drew parallels with his ideas and
Confucius's, who spoke about the rectification of names, and that if a king
were not kingly then he was not a king (this gets to some interesting
conclusions with Mencius, who said that to kill a king who does not act as a
proper king is not, in fact, regicide; to kill George W. Bush, who was not
elected president, would then not be killing the president?).

I think those who want to "cleanse English" have a moral agenda that may not
be relevant or popular anymore. Nonetheless, it involves an association of
language with thought, and that clear language represents clear thought, and
that the language we encounter in our politics and stupid media is, overall,
cluttered with unclear thought.

Perhaps my own language isn't clear enough to speak about this without
self-incrimination.

If we are in a kind of a ghetto, then we're disenfranchised. On top of that,
I'm sure a lot of professors in north america are plagued by the "those who
can't do, teach" adage, and other accusations of uselessness. Certainly a
college professor of literature is less useful than a lower-school reading
teacher, or a middle-school math teacher. And that's all within the teaching
profession.

I'm not a professor. I'm a PhD student in the department of East Asian
Language & Literatures. I feel disenfranchised, for instance, by having my
labor not recognized as labor, by having the university not pay me as much
as it pays students in the sciences (though indeed it does pay me to study
literature), by having the university not take care of health care for my
family (though indeed it does take care of health care for me). But I also
feel the pull of usefulness, how I encounter a mix of "I'm honored you study
my language & my culture" and "why are you wasting your life on ancient
poetry?" when I explain what I do to Chinese people, how I hear "you speak
Chinese so well, I'm sure there are many opportunities in business and
politics for you".

A lot of this may just be whining. We get more vacation time than anyone
else I know, and we get to read--something most people file away for leisure
time--all the time. But every time I hear a pundit complaining about the
academics in the ivory tower, I know that it's a belittlement of more than
just my career.

true. But then, why should we be ashamed of being a poet? Why should it be
considered pretentious, or removed, to care about art?

many jobs are more strenuous than "poet". I'm pretty sure of that.

I don't know what "ghettoization of the everyday" means. To me, it sounds
like an overuse of the term "ghettoization".

I suppose I was distinguishing between plagiarism and reference. Reference
is using a quotation for the purposes of quotation, even if citation might
be incomplete. It depends on the reader either not noticing the reference or
else knowing the reference as a reference. Plagiarism works the opposite
way. It works only if the reader does not know that something is being
quoted.

But what if you put four lines of shakespeare into your poem? I don't know.
I've never tried. But I would imagine that it would be like Eliot's use of
sources in "The Waste Land". Some would call it academic, some would call it
overly complex, some would call it pretentious, some would call it
unreadable, some would call it brillaint, but I don't think anyone would
call it plagiarism.

I think this is wrong on the face of it, especially as we go back
past a hundred years. Poetry requires a certain amount of time and
energy to perform, and that's time taken away from getting enough
food and shelter. The further back in the history of English-speaking
people we go, the fewer poets there can be, both as an absolute
number and as a number relative to the number of English speakers
living at any given time. Consider, for example, that Byron, perhaps
the last of the poets to be able to make rock-star money out of
poetry, when he was the toast of the English-speaking world, was
writing for something in the neighborhood of 15-20 million people --
and there are 15 million people in, for example, Pennsylvania.

There are 280 million people in the US alone, people far richer and
with an enormous amount more time to spend on non-food-acquiring
pursuits, and far more likely to be writing poetry. It seems pretty
unlikely that there aren't both more poets absolutely and more poets
in relation to the number of English language speakers now than there
were in, for example, Regency England.

I think this is simply wrong on the face of it, too. Before game
shows there were public punishments and executions, all kinds of
animal fighting, and the simple and brutal requirements of acquiring
food and shelter to occupy people -- very little of whose time was
spent respecting poetry.

But a ghetto is also both denotatively and connotatively different
from an ivory tower -- and it looks to me to be the latter you're
describing. It's hard to imagine that the reasons for a poetry ghetto
can be even metaphorically said to be the same as a political ghetto.
To compare contemporary poets in their isolation to the political
isolation of the Jews in Europe before the Holocaust is to connote,
to suggest, that disaster looms. Is that what you're trying to
connote or suggest by the use of the word "ghetto"?

The very notion of cleansing English has the sort of sound that
"Department of Homeland Security" has -- the nasty sound of
xenophobia.

Aha -- this is the attempt of the privileged to invoke the terms of
the victims, then, by clever wording? The notion that professors are
in "a kind of ghetto" makes them "disenfranchised" allows professors
to claim that they, too, are victims, and, of course, to demand
compensation for their victimization! So, what do the professors
demand? Rock star status?

Useful or less useful in what sense? Are you saying that college
professors not only are less useful than grade school teachers, but
that they know it, too -- and even aspire to that uselessness, only
to complain that their very aspirations to uselessness have
ghettoized them, victimized them, and the victimization of their own
aspirations to uselessness require redress from the public purse?

> A lot of this may just be whining.<

I think you may be on to something, here.

Why shouldn't it be? The only way that it shouldn't be would be if it
were your view that serious art ought to be as enthusiastically
embraced by the general population as entertainment is -- which is,
essentially, complaining that you'll never be a rock star.

Another thought: if I recall correctly (I don't have it in front of me at
the moment to check), this great book by Michael Davidson circles around a
kind of ekphrasis of an image on a postage stamp:

POLICE HIT JEFF BERG FROM BEHIND!

WebPosted Jun 25 2004 05:00 PM PDT VANCOUVER -
A coroner's inquest into the death of Jeff Berg has heard from a woman
who says she saw Vancouver Police officers knock Berg down and hit him
without provocation. Berg died while in police custody in October 2000.

Sari Fujikawa lived above the alleyway, where Berg was stopped by police
for his alleged involvement in theft from a marijuana grow-op. Fujikawa
wept as she told the court she saw a police officer hit Berg in the neck
from behind with the butt of his gun.

She said he fell to the ground, and crumpled up into a fetal position.
Fujikawa says police officers then kicked and punched Berg in the head.

Berg suffered severe brain damage. He later died after he was taken off
life support
She told coroner and the five-person jury that she didn't see Berg
acting aggressively toward the officers. The inquest was ordered earlier
this year, but a planned Police Complaints Commission inquiry into the
man's death is yet to go ahead.

Berg's older brother, Glen, says he was originally told a different
story by police after his brother died.

"They were telling us that he just collapsed," he says. "The first few
days the story was a lot different from the police."
The inquest is expected to resume Monday.

COP CHARGED IN FATAL 'ACCIDENT'
WebPosted Jun 25 2004 06:46 PM PDT VANCOUVER -
A rookie Vancouver Police officer has been charged after his cruiser
slammed into another car a year ago, killing a Vancouver couple.

Benito and Lina Di Spirito died June 24, 2003 when their car was struck
by a police car responding to a violent domestic dispute. The couple, in
their 60s, were preparing for their daughter's wedding at the time of
the crash.

The fatal accident happened in the early hours of the morning on
Boundary Road, between Vancouver and Burnaby. Insp. Al Boyd says Const.
Steve Vandenberg now faces a charge of driving without due care and
attention.

Police say the rookie constable had graduated from training only a month
before the accident. Vandenberg remains on the force. At the time,
police said these were the first deaths from an accident involving a
police vehicle in Vancouver in recent memory.

STONECHILD INQUIRY TO COST OVER $1M
SASKATOON - Lawyer bills for the Stonechild inquiry will cost
Saskatchewan taxpayers $1.1 million, according to an early tally of
expenses. That figure represents the lion's share of costs, so far, for
the commission.

The numbers come from the staff of Justice David Wright, who is leading
the work.
Wright was appointed to look into the freezing death of a native man,
Neil Stonechild, whose body was found in Saskatoon in 1990.

More than 60 witnesses appeared before the inquiry. Wright is now
working on his report, which will be delivered to Saskatchewan's
Minister of Justice. The total bill, as of May 30, is $1.6 million. The
largest expense, after lawyers, was for hearings rooms and services.
That bill came to just over $150,000.

[editor's note, by garlicbobcat] Neil Stonechild was the native man who
was dragged out of Regina and left to freeze to death by the racist
pigs. Whenever the police kill someone millions of dollars are spent on
trials, reports, commissions, and other garbage while the police
continue to ruthlessly murder with total impunity. I am sure that if we
did a quick study we would find that the police have the highest rate of
murdering out of any profession. That profession and culture of violence
must be confronted.

Crag,

I thought I wrote you another message too, but it looks like my email may
have eaten it.

In any case:

Peter Gizzi's new book has a number of ekphrastic poems based on paintings
and other media, including one that takes off from Albert Pinkham Ryder

I think Liz Willis' new book _Turneresque_ may involve ekphrasis but I'm not
sure (it may be slightly submerged like in much of Barbara Guest).

David Shapiro has a lot of poems that do this, and recently he has written
poems after architecture. "The Devil's Trill Sonata" from his book
_Lateness_ was based on the piece of music of the same name, though I'm not
sure how exactly.

Koch has that great poem about the "Artist" who gives all his creations
silly names and writes wonderful apostrophes to them.

Ann Lauterbach must have some ekphrastic poems somewhere too -- she has
collaborated with a number of artists.

Are we talking really old too, or just recent? There's that Demuth (I think
it's Demuth) painting after Williams' "Number 5" poem.

Robert Creeley wrote a poem for Jim Dine that's about his paintings, and I
think it's called "For Jim Dine"

There's a million others but that's all that's surfacing for the moment in
my foggy foggy head. Most of the other examples I can think of are examples
of collaboration, which might be "ekphrasis" depending on how you think
about that diea.

I guess I am curious in what way you mean ekphrasis specifically, since that
word can mean a lot of things. Just paintings, or can it be something else
too, like music? And doesn't the original definition of ekphrasis involve
describing images that don't actually exist? Just thinking out loud here...

Another interesting question to ask might be: who DOESN'T write ekphrastic
poetry? I don't mean that in a perverse way, I mean I'm interested in your
topic & in how you would define not only what ekphrasis is, but also perhaps
what it isn't.

Best,

Tim

Yes - not to be contrary to the original question - but I think it's a
harder go to find paintings (& other visual media) that have been shaped by
poems (at least in any literal sense - which might be a boring enterprise
anyway, the 'literalness' that is}.  The number of painters who have
exposure to poetry as part of their education in most art schools (with the
exception of what they might get if they opt to take a creative writing
class from the resident poet plus a good reading series) is probably
limited.   Where - for, at least poets who live in Cities - the museum and
gallery experience is more likely to be de rigueur, plus the art magazines
another influence - and consequently we are much more likely to in dialog
with the visual. I mean how many painters and photographers come to
readings, let alone buy poetry books and mags. & the critics of painting -
even when they are poets - how often to do they bring contemporary poetry
into the critical references. Say- not that I read that frequently - how
often does Peter Schjeldalh, both New York School poet and critic for the
New Yorker and other art pubs - bring reference to a particular poem or poet
into a way of looking at an artist's work? Or, how much does Guston's work
with Coolidge, Berkson and Corbett get included into the way one may frame
the world of his later visual shapes, rhythms and phrasings . (whereas R
Crumb's influence gets brought in more and more because it's maybe both
obvious and hip).

I suspect this is all changing as the multi-media core of Photoshop begins
to frame any young artist and poet's life. (Curious, to my knowledge, the
media is not making available the Text and the Audio from "those damn
digital cameras" (Rumsfeld) from Iraq prisons).

Well, that's going away from the subject. Le Roi Jones(then), Politics of
Rich Painters (title?) probably speaks best to the Duke-Monk - I'm talking
medieval occupation-  relationship of the two poets to painters. Hell hath
no lust nor envy comparable to a poet to share and receive the financial
attentions of a rich painter (or probably most 'professionals' for that
matter!

In the meantime, as always, I suggest Chris Sullivan at Slight Publications:
http://www.8letters.blogspot.com/
 for a good look at somebody who's really exploring and having fun into the
audio-visual-text diaspora!  And, also of course, Brian K Stefans  - and I
am sure others can suggest others. Course, I suspect, most would testify no
money there, either.

If one goes into olden times, of course, there are a lot of paintings based
on poems. Blake, the PreRaphaelites, etc.

Hi All:

The first series from PO25centEM is available.
The set includes 10 zines from the following contributors:

1. Richard Kostelanetz
2. Gerald Schwartz
3. Jason Christie
4. Jeff Harrison
5. Bill Allegrezza
6. Joel Lipman
7. Christophe Casamassima
8. Sheila E. Murphy
9. Martha L. Deed
10. Catherine Daly w/ Circle Jerks

There are 100 sets available and the second series (11-20) is in the making. Write us if you'd like to get yr hands on one.

Also: we're still accepting submissions for this project. Our hope is to press several hundred poets, whose zines will be distributed around the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. areas (hopefully, if this project is funded, it will be national distribution) as handouts to the public to encourage them to read more poetry. We're soliciting cash contributions for the sets only in order to press more and more for hand outs. Poetry should be free to the public: we're trying to make that happen.

Please send us work for the next series. All work is accepted by all poets: this is a universal cause.

The details: 8-16 pages of texts that fit nicely onto a 4" width by 5" height format. We'll press extra to send to the poets for their own distribution.

Carl Rakosi=20

A prot=E9g=E9 of Ezra Pound and member of the Objectivists in the 1930s, =
he took a 30-year break from poetry to work as a psychotherapist=20

Michael Carlson
Monday June 28, 2004
The Guardian=20

Only one degree of separation links Carl Rakosi, who has died aged 100, =
with the poets of Victorian England, and that link is Ezra Pound. Rakosi =
made his mark in the Objectivist issue of Poetry magazine, in 1931, as a =
Pound prot=E9g=E9. But Rakosi and his fellow poets, George Oppen, =
Charles Reznikoff and Louis Zukofsky, were already moving past Pound's =
modernism, which seemed to them almost as moribund as the tradition it =
was trying to overthrow.=20
Yet the Objectivists were primarily the children of Jewish immigrants, =
and that experience linked their work far more than any "objective" =
style. Neither were they allied politically with Pound. It is no =
coincidence that Rakosi and Oppen, both Marxists, each took a long break =
from poetry. Rakosi spent three decades as a social worker before being =
"rediscovered" by the British poet Andrew Crozier.=20

Rakosi was born in Berlin. A year later, his parents separated, and he =
spent six years with his mother's family in Hungary. His father moved to =
the US, working as a watchmaker in Chicago, where he befriended =
socialist thinkers such as Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebnicht. In 1910 =
Rakosi's stepmother came to Hungary to take Rakosi and his brother to =
America.=20

The family eventually settled in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and after starting =
university at Chicago aged 17, Rakosi transferred to the University of =
Wisconsin, where, surrounded by what he later described as "10,000 =
Babbitts", he edited the literary magazine.=20

After college he went to Australia as a mess boy, and worked with =
disturbed children in New York, which led him to return to Wisconsin to =
take a master's degree in psychology. For the next 15 years, he drifted: =
he began further degrees in law and medicine, taught English, and worked =
in a variety of jobs.=20

All the while he was writing poetry, which was published in magazines as =
prestigious as the Nation. In 1929 he changed his name, legally, to =
Callman Rawley, which he thought - in disguising his immigrant origins - =
would lead to quicker acceptance in literary circles. His writing was =
influenced strongly by the giants of American modernism: Pound's focus =
on the image, the musical language of Wallace Stevens, the inventive =
forms of ee cummings, and William Carlos Williams, whose spare lines and =
concern with everyday things helped redefine Rakosi's poetry.=20

Through correspondence with Pound, Rakosi was introduced to Zukofsky and =
the other Objectivists. Although the Objectivist issue of Poetry =
magazine linked them as a group, to Rakosi, Zukofsky's strict formal =
experiments and Reznikoff's "found poetry" were as different to each =
other as Oppen's pared down lines were to his own relaxed, almost casual =
rhythms.=20

The Objectivists did for American poetry what Henry Miller did for =
American fiction at the same period, opening it up and saying that the =
experience of being the child of immigrants is as worthy of being the =
subject of literature as that of the literary establishment. None of =
them, however, were accepted by that establishment. But in 1941, James =
Laughlin, another Pound disciple, with his own small press, published =
Rakosi's Selected Poems as an early New Directions book.=20

By then, Rakosi had earned an MA in social work at the University of =
Pennsylvania. As a Marxist, he became convinced poetry was not an =
instrument for social change. "I fell in love with social work, and that =
was my undoing as a poet," he said later, and for nearly 30 years he =
worked as a psychotherapist with disturbed children in St Louis, =
Cleveland, and Minneapolis.=20

Then, in 1965, Crozier, then a student of Charles Olson's at State =
University of New York-Buffalo got in contact with Rakosi, and his =
interest inspired Rakosi to begin writing again. In 1967, New =
Directions, by now a successful publisher, brought out Amulet, which =
included his older work alongside new poetry. This was followed by =
Ere-Voice (1971) and, from Black Sparrow, Ex Cranium, Night (1975). His =
Collected Poems was published by the National Poetry Foundation in 1986, =
and Poems 1923-1941, published by Sun and Moon Press in 1989, won a PEN =
award. Etruscan Books in this country has published new work, in Earth =
Suite (1997) and Old Poets Tale (1999).=20

Although Rakosi, in poems such as New Orleans Transient Bureau, 1934, =
captures the rhythms of real speech, as it affects the reality of daily =
life, he could be wry on a larger scale. His Americana series contains a =
brief poem called The Blank Page:=20

What's the matter? Have you nothing to say about America? Do you not =
dare be grandiose?=20

Unassuming and engaged, Rakosi had much to say about America. His poetry =
may be richer for his three decades of silence, but even in its reduced =
form, his body of work marked him out as a major modern poet.=20

His wife, Leah, predeceased him. He is survived by two sons.=20

What language does your poetry use?
What kind of constructions is involved in the language?
What is your poetry's goal pertaining to that language? What is your poetry
trying to "accomplish"?
What is it's intent?

it depends what you mean by 'constructions' - and whether you're referring
to the syntax/semantics/etc. of english (in this case), or whether you're
referencing oulipo-like constructions, or the kinds of consructions i
might use in composition.

in my case, a new way of looking at the world, a resonance with wonder -
but then does poetry always have a goal or a tendency towards an
accomplishment? perhaps delight, perhaps the landscape of the wounded -

> What is it's intent?

poetry has no intent, or goal, or attempt at accomplishment, but poets do
- it's somewhat of a romantic fallacy to attribute such to the text itself
- but the intent, goal, and accomplishment, are as above, one or
intermixed, the same, but with difference in regard to intent, as there
might not be intent at all -

Stephen, I think these are really good points. Though as a friend pointed
out to me a few years ago, there are a lot of poor painters out there that
we don't get to hear about. I wonder if instead of the relationship between
the media of poetry and painting, you might be talking about the
infrastructure surrounding these activities as it currently exists. Those
few artists who do meet with success have a gallery/museum system to lavish
a certain amount of attention and money on them. Poets don't really have
anything comparable, I think...I remember some remarks from Silliman about
this where he said (forgive my clumsy summary) that what keeps art popular
is money, what keeps music popular is the idea of virtuosity, and poetry,
well...that's a great big gray area. It's hard to commodify poetry in any
recognizable sense (though some of us are certainly trying to make progress
toward that dubious goal), because you're right, as a poet you're not going
to get a fancy monograph and several shows that travel around the country.

Re: Kim Stefans, I admire his work a lot, but I wouldn't call it ekphrasis.
As far as I understand it he's a New Media poet/artist of sorts, an activity
which inherently interdisciplinary because of the digital element through
which all other media are filtered (see Lev Manovitch's _The Language of New
Media_).

Best,

Tim

>Are we talking really old too, or just recent? There's that Demuth (I think
>it's Demuth) painting after Williams' "Number 5" poem.

Yes - not to be contrary to the original question - but I think it's a
harder go to find paintings (& other visual media) that have been shaped by
poems (at least in any literal sense - which might be a boring enterprise
anyway, the 'literalness' that is}.  The number of painters who have
exposure to poetry as part of their education in most art schools (with the
exception of what they might get if they opt to take a creative writing
class from the resident poet plus a good reading series) is probably
limited.   Where - for, at least poets who live in Cities - the museum and
gallery experience is more likely to be de rigueur, plus the art magazines
another influence - and consequently we are much more likely to in dialog
with the visual. I mean how many painters and photographers come to
readings, let alone buy poetry books and mags. & the critics of painting -
even when they are poets - how often to do they bring contemporary poetry
into the critical references. Say- not that I read that frequently - how
often does Peter Schjeldalh, both New York School poet and critic for the
New Yorker and other art pubs - bring reference to a particular poem or poet
into a way of looking at an artist's work? Or, how much does Guston's work
with Coolidge, Berkson and Corbett get included into the way one may frame
the world of his later visual shapes, rhythms and phrasings . (whereas R
Crumb's influence gets brought in more and more because it's maybe both
obvious and hip).

I suspect this is all changing as the multi-media core of Photoshop begins
to frame any young artist and poet's life. (Curious, to my knowledge, the
media is not making available the Text and the Audio from "those damn
digital cameras" (Rumsfeld) from Iraq prisons).

Well, that's going away from the subject. Le Roi Jones(then), Politics of
Rich Painters (title?) probably speaks best to the Duke-Monk - I'm talking
medieval occupation-  relationship of the two poets to painters. Hell hath
no lust nor envy comparable to a poet to share and receive the financial
attentions of a rich painter (or probably most 'professionals' for that
matter!

In the meantime, as always, I suggest Chris Sullivan at Slight Publications:
http://www.8letters.blogspot.com/
for a good look at somebody who's really exploring and having fun into the
audio-visual-text diaspora!  And, also of course, Brian K Stefans  - and I
am sure others can suggest others. Course, I suspect, most would testify no
money there, either.

Yes to poor painters and sculptors whose spare change mainly goes into
storage of such. To be among painter royalty is probably kin to getting one
of the 200 positions available in the NBA  - the basketball court, as well
as the baseball stadium and coliseum equivalent to the gallery or museum. In
fact, I read more people went to museums in America than all professional
sports combined last year. But the fetish (or iconic entrancement of the
object on the wall) creates both value and the gallery-musuem infrastructure
of which you speak.
 Comparatively for us in the Bay Area we have the Poetry Center, Small Press
Traffic at CAA, a few bookstores, and probably some of the sweetest house
poet parties in the land, all of which variously make up for the lack of
Museum etc audiences with great ears and people who buy or trade books and
listen and/or read with what might be called 'intimate intensity' - not to
be traded for the world. Hate to make it sound like a small church, or, in
some cases, borderline Dionysian practice, but...

I would prefer to let Brian Stefans say whether or not his practice (site)
represents some form of 'ekphrasis' -  is there a verb for that word, time
to invent a pronounceable one! Ekraprhasing!

"In fact, I read more people went to museums in America than all
professional
sports combined last year."

How wonderful! I hope this is actually true, though I bet the groups would
be different...a large group of mainly elderly women going to impressionist
shows probably, as opposed to the sports fan demographic.

"I would prefer to let Brian Stefans say whether or not his practice (site)

There was a recent show on Rhizome that talked about the process of
"Xphrasis," which is something slightly different I guess. And yes, by all
means I agree with you that Brian gets to define what his own practice is...

Best,

Tim

sorry Kevin, I didn't mean to be reticent.  McCaffery will be taking
up the Gray Chair this fall (teaching a to-be-announced poetics
course) and his partner Karen McCormack will also be teaching creative
writing and poetry courses in the department.  I think that's all the
details I can think of--other than that it's very good news!

best, Lori

Subject:      Re: WHY DO THE TIAWANESE
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Andrew:

Must we really do this again?

Is it not possible for you to express yourself without leaning on
some kind of Asian stereotype?

I am going to assume that the "TIAWANESE," as you style them, are a
fictional invention of yours.  They certainly resemble a lot of
racist images of Asians: they're all women-oppressing engineers who
may, if I read you right, even eat dogs (they "run over dogs like
nothing" and then "prepare meat in the gutter"...).  It's a brilliant
example of how the West blinds itself to its own prejudices by
displacing them onto the Oriental: cf. a U.S. administration that
fights against women's rights everywhere and then presents its
invasion of Afghanistan as a liberation of women.  I also like how
you've thrown in a few updated stereotypes of Asians as consumerist
dupes who just gobble up anything produced by the American culture
industry.  They sound a lot like us, really.

It is difficult for me to understand how you can ask, in a tone of
apparent concern, about "the ongoing colonization of the world's
tongues by the English language" and then turn around and provide a
shining example of just that kind of cultural imperialism: the North
American tourist who thinks he "knows" an Asian culture and feels
free to speak on behalf of, pontificate upon, and judge it.  It's
hard for me to take your other remarks and queries--which ostensibly
come from a desire to mount a radical political critique of
poetry--very seriously when you continue to accompany it with this
destructive rhetoric.  If there does seem to be, as you complain, a
lack of real debate on this list, it may be because arguments like
yours seem to be advanced in bad faith--a suspicion strengthened by
the pleasure your poem seems to take in exploiting its imperialist
position (the Taiwanese love you, they pay your loans, they scrape
and bow).  If your poem offers a critique of that position, I don't
see it.

I'm not from Taiwan, but my father's family is; if I knew more
"Chinglish" I'd be glad to corrupt your poetry with it.

Again, I have to say I'm disappointed with the extent to which
remarks like these go unchallenged on this list.  Perhaps it's
because American poets have a long history of not only thinking they
know the Orient but thinking they can somehow channel it, with not a
whole lot of awareness of their own cultural and historical position.

The question, to my mind, is not why do the Taiwanese do anything,
but why it is that a white North American needs to find them so
loathsome.

Black Spring's first issue features Stephen Ellis, as well as Brent =
Bechtel, Catherine Daly, kari edwards, Jim McCrary, Christine Murray, =
Layne Russell, and the editor.

Also has a neat and mischievous back cover the editor staged and =
photographed at the Welcome to Utah Billboard in 1995, not quite on the =
scale of Fahrenheit 9/11, nor nearly as tasteful, but kinda fun and =
risky...

Just $7 bucks.  E-mail me if you'd like to snap up a copy before I give =
too many away.  :) =20

Some time ago I posted a message expressing my surprise at the US
bombardment of a mosque in Iraq. At the time it affected me as a stunning
novelty --so much so that I responded crossly to a response by kari
edwards which situated the attack within a long tradition of US terror
including Jim Crow, anti-labor aggression, and the invasion of the
Phillippines. True enough, I conceded, but still it seemed to me that some
horrible new frontier had been crossed, and I was not yet ready to see
that day's news folded so quickly into the familiar litany.

Now these couple months later I can't even remember where that mosque
bombing took place. Was it Najaf? Fallujah? One might even be forgiven for
guessing it was somewhere in Gaza. What I'm saying is that the bombing
doesn't seem like such a novelty anymore, but rather like another dreary
link in the chain of crimes enumerated by kari in her post of April 7.
Since that time we've all been treated to abundant evidence of another,
even more gruesome link --namely the sexual abuse and torture which have
apparently been a vital component of this war effort from its beginning.
Let me say here that I have hardly known how to act or feel since the
breaking of the Abu Ghurayb prison scandal. Mainly it's a question of how
much surprise and shock to allow oneself: I for one was wholly unprepared
to see US troops acting out the paintings of Manuel Ocampo, and I'm
still totally dazed by it. But I don't know how to balance that reaction
with the radical critique buzzing in my inner ear, like "how can you be
surprised? What do you think war is, anyway?"

I expect others have had this problem also. Surprise during wartime would
seem to be little more than the mark of prior delusion and deception. And
yet who is ready to surrender their right to be shocked by the disasters
of war? Not Goya, and not me either. As it happens, I have just completed a
zine called SYRUP HITS which was in progress when the Abu Ghurayb photos
were released, and came to encapsulate my confused response to the whole
godawful mess. Apologies to my out-of-state readers, because SYRUP HITS
will not be available outside of California until September of this
year. I will however be bringing plenty of copies to tonight's event at
New Langton Arts in San Francisco (1246 Folsom btw/ 8th & 9th, 8 pm).
No need to miss Dodie Bellamy's reading at Modern Times, just swing by
afterward. Looking forward to seeing many of you there, and wishing
for peace, is LRSN

Hi,

I'm trying to gain the attention and solidarity of all the poetry editors who subscribe to the List.

I'm also asking that you send me any contact information, or perhaps will solicit writers you have worked with, anyone who is interested in contributing to the zine project.

I'm currently in the process of writing up a grant proposal to secure funds to make this project national. It is only in its infancy and a lot of ideas are being thrown around on this end, most of it idealistic.

The goal, in short, before I can write up a full length proposal, is to distribute poetry to the masses via the PO25centEM zine series. These zines are pocket sized and compact, no more than 16 pages long. We're trying to publish as many writers as possible, and I'm using my own funds, for now, and my own man power to put this project together.

I got the idea from Cole Swensen who said something to the effect that people who wait in line or are just waiting in general, like at airports and bus stations, should be reading poetry: signs should be made for escalators, elevators, waiting rooms, that have electronic signs scrolling poetry.

The zines are lightweight, compact, and come in the hottest fashionable colors. Not really. But we're going to give them out to people who are waiting for the bus or just walking about the city and encourage them to READ MORE POETRY.

I need all the help I can get, that's why I'm asking editors to work with and solicit their writers.

Any help is appreciated.

Yrs Sincerely,

Chris Casamassima

Indeed, that slippery flip of the ‘I’ and the ‘A’ is
telling. Interesting however, that you imply (perhaps
I’m stretching here) that to be styled in a form that
is different, improper, incorrect is a kind of
degradation (more on this below).

It’s somewhat short-sighted (I’m searching for
impersonal words here but coming up short myself. . .
) to think this poem isn’t knowingly enacting the
problems you rightly (re)address. As if the apparent
“I” of the poem were

a) to be identified with
b) not to be quibbled with
c) celebrated
d) transparent
e) the same (and as sturdy) as the “I” you take me to
be


And must a **purported** (heavy stress there. SIGNAL
FLASHING LIGHTS PROBLEMS TROUBLE POLITICS RACE HELP)
critique of say, Taiwanese culture, be a celebration
of the “West”?

I’m not going to speak on behalf of the poem nor shirk
off it’s glaring, in your face (who’s face?),
accusations. One way to understand racism is to have
it out with it, puke it all up on the long family
table. This is dicey to be sure but a a poem’s a nice
way to do it. And I would never put such a poem up on
any kind of listserv other than a poetics listserv
stacked with leftists and academics.

The terrible thing about many stereotypes is the
toehold they have both anecdotally and, even worse,
after more rigorous analysis—what?! Americans really
do have lots of handguns, Canadians consume an
abhorrent quantity of donuts?! the unemployment rate
among natives/aboriginal people really is that high?!
etc (please, hold on to your fisticuffs!). I’d
encourage you to look into the enrolment stats of the
students in the sciences (engineering say) vs.
humanities (lit departs say) in Taiwan AND THE
US/CANADA/AUSTRALIA/FRANCE/etc. What do they say about
me? About you? About Taiwan? About president Chen
Shui-bian? About  George W. Bush? About my mother?

There won’t be too much difference except
proportionally (per capita) you’ll find far fewer
people with MAs and PhDs in literature in Southeast
Asia than you will in North America. The shape of the
graphs will be identical though. No difference, but of
degree. When does the qualitative become quantitative?
Abandon all hope all ye who enter here.

As for the dog-thing, well the Taiwanese DO have a
different attitude towards animals (gasp). For better
or worse, but I’d say it’s far, far less hypocritical
re: agribusiness, etc. Anyway the problem of
emaciated, tripodal street dogs is well known re:
Taiwan (Some millionaire martial artists like Jackie
Chan and, I think, the laughably pony-tailed Steven
Segal,  have mounted public awareness campaigns on the
matter). I’ve assisted in taking in four baby animals
from the street(kittens, puppies) in my time here, and
that’s probably a fairly average # for foreigners
here. Does this mean all Asians are woman-hating dog
eaters?  NO, but on the level of the everyday, it’s a
concern and it **would be** in bad faith for me to
pretend I didn’t struggle with such cultural
differences. That said, why project such stereotypes
onto the Taiwanese? (Whom, incidentally, you seem to
take, following a logic not even present in the poem,
as a metonymic stand-in for “the Orient” without
invitation)Well, because they hit you in the face.
Around the corner from my ibook here the local
merchants are setting up the neighbourhood morning
market. There will indeed be people folks sitting on
the curb scaling fish, some of which aren’t yet dead.
Now, is this representative of Asian culinary
standards, etc? No, not really. You won’t find this in
Taipei even. Tainan’s the most traditional city on the
island. In an hour I’ll hop on my scooter and drive
down Mintzu Lu where restauranters defrost and
variously prepare meat, including pigeon, on the
sidewalk, literally. To an Edmontonian, this is
notable.

Does the poem perpetuate racist stereotypes by making
blanket pronouncements about the world’s largest
ethnic group?

You clearly think so, I think it invites an
interrogation of them, of ‘our’ own latently held
beliefs, or, to get all academic on those stereotypes’
asses, problematizes them, if (not) only by
foregrounding them.

It’s as if the only way another culture can be deemed
equal is if they share our own beliefs. Well shit, I
hope to god I don’t hold the same beliefs as the
average, representative Albertan, who just voted in a
bunch of old-school Conservative goons to represent
‘us’ (ugh) in Ottawa.






>> They sound a lot like us, really.

The previous (specific) points aside, what makes you
so sure this isn’t exactly “the point” of the poem as
a whole? (IE: THEY “SOUND” A LOT LIKE US, REALLY, or
do “they”?)

>It is difficult for me to understand how you can

Again, the simplistic, repetitive, insistent
(childlike) “WHY” “HOW “WHAT” of the poem foregrounds
this dynamic outright.

 If there does seem to be, as you complain, a

arguments like
yours seem to be advanced in bad faith--a suspicion
strengthened by
the pleasure your poem seems to take in exploiting its
imperialist
position (the Taiwanese love you, they pay your loans,
they scrape
and bow).  If your poem offers a critique of that
position, I don't
see it.
>>




>I'm not from Taiwan, but my father's family is; >if I
knew more
>"Chinglish" I'd be glad to corrupt your poetry >with
it.

The politics of Global English fascinate and disturb
me (and  Jiminy Cricket I don’t mean “disturb” as in ‘
pollute my poery [sic] with their Chinglish’). As a
poet/academic/American/reader (of which I am only the
last) one shudders to read Taiwanese repeatedly
rendered as “TIAWANESE” like seeing one’s **own name**
misspelled or perhaps mispronounced, a little garbled
but still unmistakable in its address/referent.

Why is that? That fascinates me. Most of the world’s
English speakers are not native speakers. ESL is a
different language than Standard American English, or
is it? Standard American English exists only as some
distant, irrelevant theory here. A walk down any
street here yields enough found poetry and para-poetic
hi-jinks to crash the server over at UBU web.(To cite
my most recent favourite, a luxury highrise complex
being built nearby has adopted the advertising pitch:
“CONFORMITEE OF THOUGHT WILL BE PLAY A LEADING ROLL IN
THE LEADING ROLL OF THE FUTURE!” There’s a
dissertation right there.)

I’ve been editing Master’s Theses for the Foreign
Languages and Literature depart at Cheng Kong
University here in Tainan (privately not as staff),
and I face interesting dilemmas in rendering 80-100
page documents into grammatically correct and, more
interestingly, ‘naturalistic’ academic prose that
wouldn’t get the remarkable achievement of the authors
(ie, writing a theses on a foreign literature **in**
that tongue!) dismissed out-of-hand at a North
American academic conference.
The ironies and complexities of the endeavor reach
their zenith in that the papers have all been in a
post-colonial critical frame (labouring heavily I
needn’t stress with the unwieldy, linguistically
unfriendly, jargon of said field). The whole thing
just makes my head spin. . . as one of the papers I
just finished ‘cleaning up’ noted (again, the
suggestion/demand for hygiene, purity, correctness,
neutrality (whiteness) in language – particularly
academic language)) the post-colonial critique ITSELF
is (largely) a “western” notion and Edward Said’s
texts must make waves in American harbours before
arriving on Asian soil (just as Fanon reached many via
Sartre?). The author of the paper notes that previous
work by Taiwanese academics on Jamaica Kincaid (who is
one of but two Caribbean(-American) writers to be
translated into trad. Mandarin – in both instances by
smallish indie/progressive presses in Taipei) has all
been written from a recognizably American
“post-colonial” perspective with **no regard for a
Taiwanese reading context.** But then, this Taiwanese
woman has to write all this in (Standard American)
English for it to have any currency whatsoever.
Insane.

But I digress, somewhat.

The poem in question says all manner of idiotic things
– “WHY DO THE TIAWANESE keep Filipinos in their
basement.” Well, anyone who’s ever spent a moment in
Taiwan knows there is no such thing as a basement in
Taiwan, the expression is meaningless here. (Taiwan is
much like Canada’s North West Territories in this
respect; indeed, much is similar, much is different).


To go on would be to belabour the point (bella bore,
belabor, tia wan ese, tie wan ese).

>>
Again, I have to say I'm disappointed with the extent
to which
remarks like these go unchallenged on this list.
Perhaps it's
because American poets have a long history of not only
thinking they
know the Orient but thinking they can somehow channel
it, with not a
whole lot of awareness of their own cultural and
historical position.
>>

Perhaps, also, it’s a testament to the persistent
relevance of identity politics (if not to the lack of
visible minorities and/or ESL speakers on this list).
Then again, maybe (and I’m not assuming this is the
case) the ambiguities and blatant ‘problems’ of the
work in question were read differently, dare I say it
with more sensitivity by others. I have my doubts
though, as—ironically for a poetics listserv—I haven’t
found much evidence of nuance in the reading one
another’s posts here. More than likely if anyone read
the piece and took offense they shrugged their
shoulders and felt too uninformed (that is, too
not-Asian) to bother weighing in.

And I’m glad you, for one, took the bait as it were. I
value your opinion and admire your insights, but
that’s all water off a duck’s back I suppose.


>>
The question, to my mind, is not why do the Taiwanese
do anything,
but why it is that a white North American needs to
find them so
loathsome.
>>

Indeed, who is the Other of the other here? From what
vantage would a waiguoren (literally ‘other-lander’),
me, the speaker of the poem, whomever, pass judgment
on the (mass) culture of a nation of people? (NOTE: if
anyone’s genuine interest in postmodern Taiwanese
culture and society is peaked, I recommend the
anthology “Cultural Change in Postwar Taiwan” edited
by Stevan Hurrell & Huang Chun-chieh.) What makes one
a tourist? Quite simply, as Paul Bowles reminded me
recently in “The Sheltering Sky,” the fact that one
returns. One does not stay. So, you’re right to imply
that I’m a tourist here (though I might have thought
you would inquire into how long I’ve lived in Asia,
whether I speak the language, have any Asian “blood”
(ha) in me, etc, but you don’t seem very interested in
making inquiries of me. I get the impression you feel
you have me pegged. But like everyone, every nation,
every people that comes to be in the sticky soup of
language, I assure you I’m a little slipperier than I
am).



Anyone who lives in a foreign culture is confronted
with some apparently radical differences. My Taiwanese
friends and co-workers are shocked to hear about the
way North Americans farm out our seniors to
institutional residences to die, alone in front of
televisions. By contrast I’m shocked that that seniors
who somehow fall outside the family network here get
between 3000-5000NT a month in gov’t assistance—that’s
less than $200 Canadian and what, $22 American.

I’m sad to say that ethnicity, language, books, TV,
cultures,  seem to have far less bearing on humanity
than good old political economy. And as a subscriber
to a poetics list I’m not no so naïve as to throw out
the Frankfurt (Frankfort?) school with the Deng
Xiaoping.


Orwell said the great enemy of clear language is
insincerity, but them’s were different, less
globalized times. I can’t help but be interested in
the inescapable non- or un- clarity of language of how
that plays out and affects intention, language
acquisition,  advertising, thought, and yes, poetry.

Anyway, I don’t know if my lengthy pontificating has
resolved anything (including my status as a racist
running dog), but I thank you for expressing your
reaction.


Best,

Andrew.

I suspect that a lot of those museum-goers are school groups.  That, and

Indeed, especially when most museums are mainly open during the
workday, you'll find lots and lots of kids.  I was recently at
the Whitney Biennial and it was packed with  with docents
leading around groups of schoolchildren.  There's something
hopelessly absurd about the process of docenting.  "Do you know
what that is?  It's a highway sign!  But it's upside down; what
do you think _that_ means?"

there are also more museums than sports teams combined, especially if one
is broad about defining what is a museum (i.e. our beloved rock'n'roll and
sci-fi museum).

and children's museums in many cities, and historical museums of all kinds

and would the baseball hall of fame also be considered a museum? as well as
the other sports museums?

but back to the poems on paintings, Crag -- are you only interested in
poems specifically on "paintings," or on other works of visual art as well?
Also, the wider you look, you find poems in collaboration with dance works,
with video works, etc. Some of these have one kind of art made "in response
to" another, and some are collaborations from the beginning. I think
probably a lot of us have been involved in the creation of such works, in
our own localities, working with artists we know. I know that Sheila Murphy
ran a series at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts that for several years
featured an annual invitation to poets to write in response to works of art
on display in that museum. Those poems were then read in a public reading
that moved around the museum.

It might be called plagiarism.  It might also be called a poem of the
form "cento," as I understand the definition.  Unless you're talking
about building a poem out of phrases pulled exclusively from
previously published poems and trying to claim authorship for those
phrases in the process.  In which case the answer to the implicit
question becomes a lot clearer, as it's better phrased: "If I claim as
original a poem built out of phrases only Google can be said to be
familiar with nobody much cares, but if I build a poem exclusively out
of phrases a lot of people will recognize as having been previously
published it's plagiarism."  It's plagiarism in both cases, but no one
has the knowledge to call you on it in the first case.

There's something in the choice of terms "phrases" and "exlusively"
that tend to paint this question in quantitative terms, when I think
(if I'm catching what you're really after) it makes more sense to me
to consider it in qualitative terms.  As posed, quantitatively, it
leads naturally to discussion about how much you can include (four
lines of Shakespeare) and still be able to call it "not plagiarism."
Obviously all single words (barring the true neoligism) would be
allowed, but it instantly becomes a qualitative issue when you get to
multiple word phrases.  Using "cloth buttons" isn't going to cause
much ruckus, but using "tender buttons" could.  And it just gets worse
the longer the string of words you use.

Beyond the (long) history of cento, there's also pieces like John
Cage's Writing for the Second Time through Finnegans Wake, and Tom
Phillips' Humument, neither of which I would consider plagiarism,
though both are made up exclusively from previously published phrases
(all from the same author, in each case, to boot).  Intent certainly
plays a role in that determination, but I feel that the way the
original was used was qualitatively different from an act of
plagiarism as well (it does get tangled here, because intent is itself
a qualitative feature).

I have no trouble imagining a poem that includes four full lines of
Shakespeare in it.  I do think, however, that that poem should fully
expect to be able to justify the inclusion--not a quantitative
justification of making sure its long enough that the four lines
represent some fixed measurable sufficiently small overall percentage
to be defined as other-than-plagiarism, but a qualitative
justification that manages to communicate, "Ah yes, this poem must be
so."=20=20

Thanks for asking.

Dan

PO25centEM zines are pocket sized zines that will be handed out individually AND serialized with other zines in the series to make an 'autonomous anthology.' So far we have numbers one through ten available, but single copies are always floating around and being traded: they are handed out in Baltimore and in Washington, D.C. The pocket sized zines are compact and are 16 pages or less, making for an intimate read while waiting for the bus or the train, or just lazing the day away. The jist of this project is to get everyone to read more poetry. We're handing out free poetry to recover the sense of readership in a public that seems to not care about poetry. Folks may keep or give the zines away to others, so the turnover rate is unlimited, trading goes on forever.

Furniture Press needs all the texts it can get. We're bent on publishing every writer and anthologize this project: we're hoping to receive substantial funding and a national coverage. Hopefully other presses will start doing the same.

The goal, for now, while funding is low, is to serialize the zines and sell them in packs of ten. These contributions will go to the pressing of more zines for a wider distribution.

Here are the specifications for submission:

The zines dimensions are 4.25 inches by 5.5 inches. Send texts between 8 and 16 pages that fit nicely onto a 4 inch width by 5 inch height format. Please send texts to furniture_press@graffiti.net. No titles are necessary, any work, old and new is welcome.

Anyone who wishes to contribute donations will receive the first 10 in the series for $5+($1 or SASE) shipping. Everyone will get ten copies of their zines to distribute themselves or to trade with others.

Our address is

PO25centEM
19 Murdock Road
Baltimore MD 21212

The first series from PO25centEM is available.
The set includes 10 zines from the following contributors:

1. Richard Kostelanetz
2. Gerald Schwartz
3. Jason Christie
4. Jeff Harrison
5. Bill Allegrezza
6. Joel Lipman
7. Christophe Casamassima

10. Catherine Daly w/ Circle Jerks

I remain astonished by text - these letters various in size & shape & origin
- which, when minimally combined into units called words and with a little
education become a means of eliciting images and patterns of thoughts within
"mind's eye."   & then literature of a page. "See Jane run." My earliest
primer
For as long as I live, I will always - as almost a first love, odd as it
seems, see Jane run. And Dick.

Paint - in all the various phrasing of its units - one brush stroke or
multiple ones - does not require any translation to be apprehended. No
matter what a painting might compel me to think or feel or act, the material
itself, on one level, is always entire and present.  Unlike a word, one
doesn't have to take it to another level, make a translation, to know what's
there or what it means,or that it has to mean anything.
The official and private words very clearly or obliquely describing/defining
the torture in Iraq required a reader, a responsive one at that. T'was
ignored, repressed or said to be "still going up the chain of command."
The pictures, however, were self-evident(ce). The straight image from the
digital field did the job.
I am not sure where this is going. But I am kind of disturbed here in some
of the posts at the seeming contempt for the popularity of museums - the
degradation of the goers (kids and little ol' ladies, etc.)  I actually love
it that people of all kinds are going. (I don't like the idea that
corporations have infested museums with blockbuster crowd movement tactics -
which violate any possible sense of 'real' engagement - it means
strategizing the hours in which it's best to visit).  But, gosh, one
powerful image may steer somebody's life into a different, maybe more
interesting direction.  Like a great image on a poetry book cover, or a
title, "Bean spasms" - 30 years ago - suddenly poetry has a fresh kick and I
bought the book. Berrigan, Ted, indeed. (Or, foggy me, and the book long ago
stole, was that Ron Padgett, or were they collaboratively in league?!!)

I guess the larger sadness is that so many are giving up on the imaginative
and critical act of reading - or so it seems. The image of Michael Moore
rolling around the Capitol building in a ice cream trucking reading the
Patriot Act to congresspersons who don't read the very Acts that they
approve is maybe emblematic of a larger issue. A democracy wiped out because
its members refused to read the text that killed the republic. Or back to
WCW on those who die for the lack of it - poetry. (And other media -
painting, dance, etc., too.)

I have just caught up to this conversation. It's an important one, I =
think.
So here's my two cents: Andrew wrote, in response to Tim:

>>It's somewhat short-sighted.to think this poem isn't knowingly =
enacting
the problems you rightly (re)address. As if the apparent "I" of the poem
were

a) to be identified with
b) not to be quibbled with
c) celebrated
d) transparent
e) the same (and as sturdy) as the =13I=14 you take me to be<<

My own problem with the poem is precisely that the position--identity,
politics, gender, whatever--of its speaker/voice/"I" is too slippery. =
The
flipping of "i" and "a" in the word "Tiawanese," while it says something
about, at the very least, the speaker's pronunciation and, at the most, =
if
one chooses to indulge in a stereotypical identification of a certain =
kind
of pronunciation with a certain level of ignorance/political =
conservatism,
etc., about the speaker's politics, racism, etc., this very small signal
does nothing to give me access to what this speaker/voice/"I" thinks =
about
him or herself and the views he or she is expressing; there is nothing =
in
the poem that reflects on what is said in the poem, no distance, nothing
that opens a space for me as a reader to grapple with anything other =
than
the plain, surface meaning of the words, which are hard to read in any =
way
other than the way Tim reads them.

It is, of course, possible to say, as Andrew has done, that the flipping =
of
the "i" and the "a" and the very blunt, in-your-faceness of the poem =
point
to the irony his response to Tim makes clear he wants readers to =
understand
as informing the poem, but the fact that this is Andrew's intent does =
not
mean the poem is successful in realizing it, and if the poem is not
successful in realizing it--as I think it is not--then Tim's critique =
seems
to me valid and accurate. Not because the "sturdy" "I" Andrew says Tim =
takes
to be him (Andrew) is a racist--I don't know Andrew and so have no basis =
to
say anything about this one way or the other--but because the effect of =
the
poem's language is to express, unironically and uncritically, the racism =
Tim
sees in it.=20

The question here seems to me to be one of authorial responsibility and
accountability and to say, as Andrew seems to be saying, that what I =
will
call the "undeveloped slipperiness" of the "I" is enough for the poem to
succeed--as opposed to a developed but nonetheless unreliable "I"--is to
take the easy way out and to avoid responsibility and accountability for
what the poem's language expresses. Andrew suggests that on some level =
he is
aware of this problem when he says that he would never post such a poem
except to a listserv such as this one--which I understand to mean that =
he
would not post it somewhere where someone would make the mistake of =
assuming
he, Andrew, really does hold these views or where someone might take the
poem and use it somehow to support a racist agenda.

Ultimately, then,--and, again, I am taking Andrew at his word that this
intention is to hold the beliefs expressed in the poem up for critical
engagement--the difficulties of this poem seem to me to be rooted in
shortcomings of craft.


>>And must a **purported** (heavy stress there. SIGNAL
FLASHING LIGHTS PROBLEMS TROUBLE POLITICS RACE HELP)
critique of say, Taiwanese culture, be a celebration
of the =13West=14?<<

Given that the poem is written in English and that, as I said above, =
there
is no access to the "I's" position, this question seems to me =
disingenuous,
at the least. If the "I" is not asking his or her questions from a =
Western
perspective and therefore, by implication at least, celebrating the =
West,
where is the evidence for that in the poem?

There is a great deal more to say about this, I think. But, for me, for =
now,
it would all come down to variations on what I have said above. The =
poem,
for me, fails to do what the author, Andrew, suggests it was intended to =
do;
his explanation of what it was intended to do doesn't have the effect, =
for
me, of "making" the poem do it. Rather, it highlights the way the poem
fails.

not "the crazy house called ameriKKKAnada" and profits. So we are going
to get martyrs. We have been willing to hide behind martyrs for
political, financial and even artistic gain, B.U.T. we are going to have
live with the overstanding that we have to be willing to be become
martyrs and to realize that martyrs are special not because they are
perfect nor that they are higher powers B.U.T. that they are flawed
bruhs and sis (breathing clay) like us all on this earth -- who despite
all that was against them stood up and perished for a principle = their
peoples/culture.

It does seem that everybody around the world are taking up mental and
physical arms to fight for their freedome and culture as the once great
fighters and griots of North Amerikkka akt like steppinfetchits in
sagged drope gear and butterfly mcqueens inna thog and bare middrifts or

-- which seems to be extending into afrika for the sake of corperate
takeovers) or even the alterna crowd aktin like "anarchy" is the latest
trend for the middle-classes and profits in this post hip hop wasteland.
This was/is not a revoltuon; this is surrender with a spin doctored
effect and north amerikkkan twisted logic and bravado -- where cowards
are brave and brave people are punkass, where whores are worhipped and
money is god and greed is good, where warriors/freedome
fighters/revultionarys who are defending are terrorist and terrorist
where suits and ties and are called liberators, deomocratic and
civilized, where might makes right -- fuck quality it's about knocking
out the suckers by any means necceSCAREY -- welcome to the terrordome of
theivery -- come bite me.

I have seen too many people murdered and demoralized in this land which
is suppose to be so civilized. I have seen my fathers mind destroyed and
my body and my friends raped and used, as has been our minds, and then
discarded as worthless tools for the amusement and advancement of
robberbarons and the fools they court.  I have heaerd and seen people
use our skin and class to advance their position witht he opppressors
and danced onthe graves of our martyrs.  I have seen too much cruelity
(yet still not even enough -- to start)  to make me reconsider the value
of this wasteland as anything but currupt from the inside out and
therefore in need of dismantling and not salvaging-- a place where
incompetence, mediocrity, dirty tricks, distraction, hypocrisy, invasion
and perversion rule and are keys to success and all must convert or die
a slow and amusing spiritual and mental death and surrender is taken up
as a battle cry.  A place where passion is laughed at and mocked. Where
children rhyme cruelity. I have seen my soul slip slowly into despair
simply by the sight of this horror alone and what is more tragic I have
seen the despair blanket the peoples around me as their spiritual
physical corpses as piled up like so many rhowandan, african,
Palestinian, Native holocaust images as the fatted ministries workers,
corperate lackies and greed mongerers sit, laugh and plot for more
bullying tactics against those who are percieved as weaker and
defenseless in this their police state calling itself a free
CIVI(LIE)zation = better than the rest-- B.U.T. are my bruthas
defenseless against the shocktroops of this so called democracy or have
they been convinced of this lie...

...and I wonder is this the beginning of a revolution or is it too late.
I feel that there is no escape and after all these years I still don't
know what's the price of a ticket. Will we have a dream of Malik or Poor
Marcus, Peltier, Spies or Ashura realized

They say that it's a hard and bad time for our Nation...

It is a time for martyrs and it's time to fight for freedomes B.U.T. all
we seem to get is a copping a plea and surrender.

B.U.T. "...can't you show me nothing but surrender"?

Charles and others:

So that it's doable, so that we can nudge the dialogue on this topic
with/through an issue of a print magazine, SPORE (formerly SCORE) will start
narrow: we're interested, then,  in poems on specific works of visual art
(painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, collage...) that can be
reproduced (were we ever fortunate enough to reprint any of these works),
thus at this time, this two-dimensional space, dance is out (I'm wondering
what I would do with MacLow's The Pronouns). On a personal level, however,
my search is writ large: I'm interested in collecting and studying all
writing that is a response to other art forms (music, dance, performance,
theater...). I'm interested in how the writing is in-formed by the work it's
a response to. I'm especially interested in ferretting out the patterns of
response such as those I've noticed in the Creeley and Rand collaboration:
assume character/'s voice/s to speak to another character in the work, or to
the painter or viewer, something Creeley did often in Drawn & Quartered;
write a literal description of details to shape a comment on the tone or
mood of the painting, a kind of verbal caption; use the painting or object
(I think of Coolidge's The Crystal Text) as a springboard, an initial
specific reference before the work takes off on its own...

Let me know if Sheila has any record/ing of the poems written in Scottsdale.

Much appreciate the the responses to my query -- to this list and
backchannel, I've got hundreds of poems I've got to find and read. My
contribution to the issue of SPORE (deadline Dec. 31) will be a bibliography
of these works, perhaps annotated. Happy trails!

Best, Crag

and children's museums in many cities, and historical museums of all kinds

and would the baseball hall of fame also be considered a museum? as well as
the other sports museums?

but back to the poems on paintings, Crag -- are you only interested in
poems specifically on "paintings," or on other works of visual art as well?
Also, the wider you look, you find poems in collaboration with dance works,
with video works, etc. Some of these have one kind of art made "in response
to" another, and some are collaborations from the beginning. I think
probably a lot of us have been involved in the creation of such works, in
our own localities, working with artists we know. I know that Sheila Murphy
ran a series at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts that for several years
featured an annual invitation to poets to write in response to works of art
on display in that museum. Those poems were then read in a public reading
that moved around the museum.

Andrew:

Your lengthy response, whether I agree with it or not, provides
precisely what your poem itself doesn't: context and critical
distance for your own position.  The distinctiveness of your
experience--as a North American doing something like academic
contract work at a Taiwanese university--is actually quite
interesting and, yes, something beyond my own experience, something I
might like to hear about.  It's too bad that your poem didn't reflect
any of that subtlety or analysis.

Your defense of the poem seems to be something like this: We on this
list are sophisticated enough to know that no one who would subscribe
to this list would *seriously* profess the kind of crude (even
racist) sentiments your poem does; therefore we must assume that
these sentiments, far from being endorsed, are paradoxically being
parodied or critiqued.  That's a lot to assume.  It's more broadly
based in what I would call a vulgar poststructuralism: since we know
there is no such thing as a stable "I," no speaker can be held
responsible for anything he or she says.  (A counterproposal I recall
from another contemporary poet: poststructuralist insights make you
have to be *more* responsible, drawing attention as they do to the
politics of every textual choice and not just explicit "content.")

In this respect, I think Rich Newman's critique is quite right: the
poem's failure is precisely that it does not sufficiently "open a
space for the reader" to understand the context from which it
emerges; it simply asks us to take on faith that it does not mean
what it appears to mean.  Your previous use of images like the
"Filipino crack whore" in your posts gives me little reason to extend
such faith to you.

You ask why a "purported critique of Taiwanese culture" has to be
read as "a celebration of the West."  Well, precisely because the
poem is marked as emanating from the West and is articulated through
precisely those tropes the West uses to render the Orient
abject--animals, food, women.  As Rich points out, the poem is
written in English, and it is circulated over a listserv housed in
the United States and read mostly by people resident in the U.S. and
Canada.  And in the absence of any other authorial marker, I would
note that even in the allegedly borderless space of the Internet, the
poem emanates from a domain clearly marked as Canadian (yahoo.ca);
even if the poem was written from your actual physical location in
Taiwan (a point that seems important for you to establish the
authenticity of your observations) it reads as if penned at home in
Edmonton, in more ways than one.

So in what sense can your poem be said to evade its own position in
that discourse we would call "the West"?  It can't.  And that's not
to say that I'm any less "of the West" than you are; the mere fact
that my parents are Chinese doesn't mean that my perceptions of
Taiwan would somehow be better or more authentic than yours.  Indeed,
I'm less concerned about the accuracy of your observations than about
the effect your method of stating them has for its intended
audience--an audience of largely white North Americans among whom, I
would hazard, ethnic minorities, Asian and otherwise, are
significantly underrepresented.  In that context, what I hear in your
poem is not some sort of rigorous critique of Taiwanese society (if
you want to mount one, more power to you), but a rehearsal of
hot-button images that plug right into anti-Asian racism at home.  I
am--preemptively, as it were--eliding "Taiwan" with "Asia" or "the
Orient" because that is precisely what happens as the images you use
enter American discourse.  Your poem gives us no context for
understanding what in it is distinctive to Taiwan or even to your
particular experience, and your likely readers will have no context
for understanding that either.

Really, the problem is that you want to have it both ways: you want
to preserve your right to pronounce upon Taiwanese culture--in the
crudest of terms, if necessary--and at the same time dance away
whenever someone seeks to call you on it.  Thus I'm stunned by your
response to "the dog-thing," as you put it.  On the one hand, you
suggest I'm dense for taking that stereotype (that Asians abuse and
eat dogs) seriously; then you proceed to tell me that the reason you
use the stereotype is that it's just true!  "Why project such
stereotypes onto the Taiwanese," you ask?  "Well, because they hit
you in the face."  Precisely: the Westerner sees precisely those
things he has been culturally prepared to see; those are the things
that "hit him in the face."  Describing what most disgusts us in a
culture is a way of creating cultural hierarchies--of rendering, in
this case, the Asian as somehow outside the human.

Am I suggesting that you simply should not speak about your
experiences in Asia?  No.  You're absolutely correct to say that "it
would be in bad faith for me to pretend I didn't struggle with such
cultural differences."  But it's precisely that struggle that I don't
see in your poem or, frankly, in your follow-up post.  Perhaps this
is all just a question of tone; what I hear in the poem's use of its
racist tropes is a tone of arrogance, objectification and ridicule,
and not enough of that is (or could be) self-directed to be an excuse.

>>2 Given the ongoing colonization of the world=12s
tongues by the English language and the predominance
of English as **the** language of global capital, is
it possible to write in English in good faith?<<

Seems to me this assumes there is only one English and that this English =
is
wielded only in the name of colonization and global capital. In fact, a
multiplicity of Englishes exists, ranging from what some linguists call
African-American Vernacular English and the English creoles spoken in =
many
parts of the world to the Englishes used in England, Scotland, South =
Africa,
Australia, India, Nigeria, the Philippines and so on. This is not to =
deny
the fact that English, and I will leave open the question of which =
English
this is, has also become "the language of global capital" and that--as
happened in South Africa--important questions need to be asked about the
relationship between English as the language of colonization and those
people(s) it has colonized, nor is it to deny the importance of =
attending to
the responsibility and accountability of those who write in English in
positioning themselves relative to this truth about the language in =
which
they write. But the purported naivete of this question seems to me a =
very
uninteresting one because the question itself--"is it possible to write =
in
English in good faith?"--begs the question of what one means by "in good
faith." Even writers who support the colonizing aspects of English/the =
use
of English as an instrument of colonization write in English in good =
faith,
in the sense that their intentions, within their own contexts, are =
"good." A
more useful question, I think, would have touched on issues such as =
these:

1. The value/uses of code-switching--moving from one language/level of
diction/dialect/etc. to another within the same poem.

2. The politics of translation, of bringing into English the
work/sensibilities/etc. of other languages/cultures/writers/etc.

3. The use of voice and other techniques/aspects of craft as devices =
through
which writers position themselves relative to the colonizing aspects of
English. (The discussion about Andrew Loewen's poem, Why Do The =
Tiawanese,
is apt here; one of the questions those of us who have critiqued the =
poem
seem to be asking is whether, indeed, it is possible to tell from the =
poem
itself whether Andrew wrote it in good faith.)

>>Is the fact that English Literature departments in
N. America have become a de-fault refuge for =13radical=14
(politicized) thought in an institutional/public
context, to some extent, a case of guilt-induced
bad-faith? (How should ESL students fare in English
courses? Should their work be assessed on the same
lines as first-language students =16 does anyone else
struggle w/ this question?)<<

I'm not entire sure what the first part of this question means, but I =
have
been struggling with the question about ESL students for 15 years now, =
many
of them as the English Department ESL placement coordinator at the =
college
where I teach, and it seems to me that the question needs to be made =
more
subtle than it is here. Usually, when people ask about how ESL writing
should be assessed, they are talking most obviously about the issue of
grammar and other surface features of the writing, i.e., on the most =
basic
level, should an ESL student who consistently makes simple verb-tense =
errors
or subject-verb-agreement errors be held accountable for those errors in =
the
same way that a student writing in his or her first language would be? =
This
question gets more complicated when you talk about sentence-structure =
errors
or errors of idiom and so on, but no matter how complicated you want to =
make
it, it comes down to the question of whether the student has sufficient
command of English. "Sufficient" should not mean "complete." Students
writing in their first language, those of us on this list who have been
writing seriously, perhaps even daily, in our first language(s) for =
many,
many years, all make mistakes. So the question, if you are assessing ESL =
and
non-ESL students in the same group, is how you weight the kinds of =
errors
each group makes--and they are different kinds of errors--relative to =
each
other. In this respect, we--meaning those of us
teaching/reading/publishing/etc. ESL writers--have a right to expect a =
given
level of linguistic accuracy (which I will leave undefined since its
definition depends an awful lot on context) from ESL writers appropriate =
to
the level in which they are writing.

This whole question becomes more complex and more highly politicized =
when
you start to consider the relationship between how an ESL writer writes =
in
English and what he or she is trying to say, which, as often as not, has =
its
origins in a language/culture that is foreign to English and may even =
feel
to that writer inexpressible in English. I should also say that how you =
ask
this question depends a great deal on the position of the writer: Is he =
or
she learning/writing English in his or her own native country or in a
country where English the "first" language? (And let's leave aside the =
very
difficult question of what it means precisely to define a language as
"native" or "first." The linguist's definition of a language: a dialect =
with
an army.) Has he or she immigrated to the country where he or she is
learning English? Is he or she a student planning to return to his or =
her
home country? Have they reached a sufficient level of =
education/linguistic
development that what they are doing is transferring a realm of =
discourse
they already command in their native language to English? Or, as is the =
case
with my wife, are they acquiring this realm of discourse in English for =
the
first time? And so on.

To elide these subtleties, as well as the many other subtleties I have =
not
mentioned, is to risk--as I think the first question I commented on also
risks--essentializing both English and ESL in ways that ultimately
contribute to colonization rather than working against it.

Subject: Looking for Poems on Paintings/CALL FOR POEMS


Charles and others:

So that it's doable, so that we can nudge the dialogue on this topic
with/through an issue of a print magazine, SPORE (formerly SCORE) will =
start
narrow: we're interested, then,  in poems on specific works of visual =
art
(painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, collage...) that can be
reproduced (were we ever fortunate enough to reprint any of these =
works),
thus at this time, this two-dimensional space, dance is out (I'm =
wondering
what I would do with MacLow's The Pronouns). On a personal level, =
however,
my search is writ large: I'm interested in collecting and studying all
writing that is a response to other art forms (music, dance, =
performance,
theater...). I'm interested in how the writing is in-formed by the work =
it's
a response to. I'm especially interested in ferretting out the patterns =
of
response such as those I've noticed in the Creeley and Rand =
collaboration:
assume character/'s voice/s to speak to another character in the work, =
or to
the painter or viewer, something Creeley did often in Drawn & Quartered;
write a literal description of details to shape a comment on the tone or
mood of the painting, a kind of verbal caption; use the painting or =
object
(I think of Coolidge's The Crystal Text) as a springboard, an initial
specific reference before the work takes off on its own...

Let me know if Sheila has any record/ing of the poems written in =
Scottsdale.

Much appreciate the the responses to my query -- to this list and
backchannel, I've got hundreds of poems I've got to find and read. My
contribution to the issue of SPORE (deadline Dec. 31) will be a =
bibliography
of these works, perhaps annotated. Happy trails!

Best, Crag

and children's museums in many cities, and historical museums of all =
kinds

and would the baseball hall of fame also be considered a museum? as well =
as
the other sports museums?

but back to the poems on paintings, Crag -- are you only interested in
poems specifically on "paintings," or on other works of visual art as =
well?
Also, the wider you look, you find poems in collaboration with dance =
works,
with video works, etc. Some of these have one kind of art made "in =
response
to" another, and some are collaborations from the beginning. I think
probably a lot of us have been involved in the creation of such works, =
in
our own localities, working with artists we know. I know that Sheila =
Murphy
ran a series at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts that for several =
years
featured an annual invitation to poets to write in response to works of =
art
on display in that museum. Those poems were then read in a public =
reading
that moved around the museum.

Subject: Attention Press Editors


| Hi,
|
| I'm trying to gain the attention and solidarity of all the poetry editors
who subscribe to the List.
|
| I'm also asking that you send me any contact information, or perhaps will
solicit writers you have worked with, anyone who is interested in
contributing to the zine project.
|
| I'm currently in the process of writing up a grant proposal to secure
funds to make this project national. It is only in its infancy and a lot of
ideas are being thrown around on this end, most of it idealistic.
|
| The goal, in short, before I can write up a full length proposal, is to
distribute poetry to the masses via the PO25centEM zine series. These zines
are pocket sized and compact, no more than 16 pages long. We're trying to
publish as many writers as possible, and I'm using my own funds, for now,
and my own man power to put this project together.
|
| I got the idea from Cole Swensen who said something to the effect that
people who wait in line or are just waiting in general, like at airports and
bus stations, should be reading poetry: signs should be made for escalators,
elevators, waiting rooms, that have electronic signs scrolling poetry.
|
| The zines are lightweight, compact, and come in the hottest fashionable
colors. Not really. But we're going to give them out to people who are
waiting for the bus or just walking about the city and encourage them to
READ MORE POETRY.
|
| I need all the help I can get, that's why I'm asking editors to work with
and solicit their writers.
|
| Any help is appreciated.
|
| Yrs Sincerely,
|
| Chris Casamassima

Subject: "BIOTERRORISM" DOWNGRADED TO PETTY THEFT IN FBI EMBARRASSMENT

June 29, 2004
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Contact: mailto:media@caedefensefund.org

"BIOTERROR" CHARGES DOWNGRADED TO "MAIL FRAUD" IN STEALTH INDICTMENT
U.S. Attorneys attempt to cast $256 technicality as health and safety
issue in "stealth" indictment

Professor Steve Kurtz was charged today by a federal grand jury in
Buffalo, New York--not with bioterrorism, as listed on the Joint
Terrorism Task Force's original search warrant and subpoenas, but with
"petty larceny," in the words of Kurtz attorney Paul Cambria. (See
http://www.caedefensefund.org/ for background.)

Also indicted was Robert Ferrell, head of the Department of Genetics at
the University of Pittsburgh's School of Public Health. The charges
concern technicalities of how Ferrell helped Kurtz to obtain $256
worth of harmless bacteria for one of Kurtz's art projects.

The laws under which the indictments were obtained--Title 18, United
States Code, sections 1341 and 1343, covering mail and wire fraud--are
normally used against those defrauding others of money or property, as
in telemarketing schemes.

This is a far cry from the bioterrorism charges originally sought by
the District Attorney. To make a "federal case" out of such minor
allegations, the District Attorney will have the burden of proving
criminal intent.

"There was very obviously no criminal intent," said Kurtz attorney
Cambria. "The intent was to educate and enlighten." Cambria suggested
that the pursuit of such a minor case at the federal level was
profoundly absurd. "If the University of Pittsburgh feels that there
was a contract breach, then their remedy is to sue Steve for $256 in a
civil court."

A STEALTH INDICTMENT

The U.S. District Attorney attempted to cast the issue as one of public
health and safety in a public press conference called without the
knowledge of either defendant's lawyers, thus eliminating the chance of
rebuttal. During the conference, parts of which were broadcast on local
Buffalo news channels, U.S. Attorney William Hochul and U.S. District
Attorney Michael Battle repeatedly alluded to "dangerous" and
"bio-hazardous material," even though the charges have nothing to do
with such issues, and scientists universally regard the materials in
question as safe.

At one point in the press conference, U.S. Attorney Hochul stated that
Serratia marcescens, one of the two bacteria ordered by Ferrell, "is in
fact a dangerous material in that it can cause pneumonia." Serratia
cannot cause pneumonia, only aggravate it in someone who already has
it, and very rarely at that. Furthermore, it would be hard to
characterize as a "dangerous material" something that high school
students routinely use in biology class experiments. (Easily trackable
by its bright red color, S. marcescens is commonly used to demonstrate
the many ways microbes can be destroyed--e.g. with household bleach.
The other bacterium, Bacillus globigii, is also used in experiments as
a stand-in for dangerous microbes--precisely because it is harmless.)

Many believe the attempt to cast the $256 technicality as a public
health and safety issue is a face-saving measure by the government,
which has already expended an enormous amount of time and money in
their fruitless pursuit of this case.

ONLY THE BEGINNING

Although the original bioterrorism charges are now completely off the
table, the trial still promises to be financially and psychologically
draining for the defendants.

The international support of the defendants by artists, scientists and
other citizens has been remarkable; it is crucial that this support
continue as the government extends this outrageous and wasteful
persecution into a grueling trial.

Hi Everyone,

First off, thanks all for the solidarity, the zines project looks like it's going to be in everyone's hands very soon.

Another thing, Geoffrey Gatza has told me that his e-mails directed to my graffiti address have been bounced back to him as spam.

Please try me at Pastamassima@yahoo.com if there are any problems. I don't want to miss anyone's important letters.

Thanks again, keep the word open.

Instrumentality, by Ravi Shankar, Cherry Grove Collections, May 2004=20

ADVANCE PRAISE FOR INSTRUMENTALITY=20

Instrumentality plays expectations and delivers uncanny reformulations =
that seem "predestined, in retrospect." Ravi Shankar's poems are filled =
with the pleasure of subjects dissolving into ideas, ideas folding into =
sounds, and sounds echoing familiar but elusive translocations.=20
                -Charles Bernstein=20

Quirky, quizzical, inquisitive, Ravi Shankar in Instrumentality goes in =
quest of what the oddness of language and imagination can reveal: "a =
hush of atoms holding a planet together." By turns, lyrical and =
meditative, these poems are guided by a strong intelligence toward =
resolutions that are both surprising and apt.=20
                -Gregory Orr

"A New Confessions of Zeno, this time in verse. Topics most of us brood =
over in private are here brought out into daylight by an analyst clad in =
bullet-proof unembarrassment.  Ravi Shankar is a comic tragedian of =
philosophic collisions that occur at the intersection of memory, desire, =
perception, mutability, and language. Wild swoops made on the rheostat =
of diction and intricate consonantal echolocation enable the invention =
of this poet's analogue for the metamorphic nature of what is past, or =
passing, or to come."
                -Alfred Corn=20

Ravi Shankar's poems are immortal in the flesh, finding in the life of =
the mind--its interpretations, its "instrumentality"--the surpassing, =
transient lyrical moment; and in the life of the world's body the =
permanent, unflinching presence of thought, unconfined by time or space. =
They are the verbal artifacts of a singular, many-sided, and =
distinguished consciousness.
                -Vijay Seshadri=20

This is a very special first book. Ravi Shankar's poems have a fine =
tuned sense of form, a rare delight in language. Through wit and =
abstraction they reveal a metaphysics of longing, binding us to the =
elements of our moving world.
                -Meena Alexander

Here are poems I've not seen before.  A fog lifts and Ravi Shankar gives =
the reader a landscape of language filled with sharp, stainless, =
geometric forms. There is considerable distance to travel from page to =
page. Even in a poem like "Home Together" Shankar detects a vacuum in =
love. From a men's room to a San Francisco sunrise, Shankar emerges with =
a pocketful of koans reflecting the wisdom hidden in the stars.=20
                - E. Ethelbert Miller

Lovers of poetry will find in Ravi Shankar's INSTRUMENTALITY the lucky =
serendipity one hopes for in a new poet: an original voice. The poems =
take their origin as does all fine poetry, in a love of language and a =
metaphorical vision combined with the imperative of music.  Below the =
shimmering surface, however, currents of Indian spirituality and western =
philosophy draw the reader deeper into the works - a serious dialectic =
playing out in the soul of a sensitive young man pondering life's =
mysteries, large and small. The old questions take on a freshness and =
interest when seen through the new eyes of a poet of such complexity. =
Other times, the work is more playful. Like Wallace Stevens or the =
metaphysical poets, his conceits sing with intelligence, wit, and the =
intricacies of extended metaphor. Coming away from the work, one thinks =
of the jewel-encrusted coat of a raja or a wizard - a pun comes to mind: =
Ravishing. In a long poem celebrating the launching of the space shuttle =
Discovery, th poet says, "I feel as though a part of us has lifted off." =
And so it is for the reader of this fine collection of poems.=20
        -Richard Harteis=20

In the stunning title poem of Instrumentality, Shankar writes of =
"action's unstuttering arc which is eloquence and muteness at once." =
That idea expresses what I find in this collection, for here poems =
becomes performatives that enacts their totality in the tension between =
graceful expression and silence.  Shankar is a deeply philosophical poet =
who explores the major questions while attuned to the flux that is the =
very stuff of existence, and does so while moving from place to =
place-Illinois, Florida, Mumbai, Monteverde, and Hell's Kitchen-a =
Spiderman of the imagination. And, in terms of tone, there's no cynicism =
or irony here, rather the pleasures of varied vocabularies and deft =
juxtapositions ajumble on multiple levels. One senses the sheen of a new =
poetry.

                -Gray Jacobik
                author of Brave Disguises

Ravi Shankar is poet-in-residence at Central Connecticut State =
University and the founding editor of the online journal of the arts, =
<http://www.drunkenboat.com>. His first book Instrumentality, is due out =
in May 2004 from Word Press. His work has previously appeared or is =
forthcoming in such places as The Paris Review, Poets &Writers, Time Out =
New York, Gulf Coast, The Massachusetts Review, Descant, LIT, Crowd, The =
Cortland Review, Catamaran, The Indiana Review, Western Humanities =
Review, The Iowa Review, Smartish Pace, and the AWP Writer's Chronicle, =
among other publications. He has read at such venues as The National =
Arts Club, Columbia University, KGB, and the Cornelia Street Caf=E9, has =
held residencies from the MacDowell Colony, Ragdale, and the Atlantic =
Center for the Arts, has served on panels at UCLA, Poet's House, =
South-by-Southwest Interactive/Film Festival, and the AWP Conference in =
Baltimore, given commentaries on NPR and been interviewed on Connecticut =
radio, reviews poetry for the Contemporary Poetry Review and is =
currently editing an anthology of South Asian, East Asian, and Middle =
Eastern poetry. You can read an interview with him at: =

Masters of Terror
gönderen: Samizdat Tuesday June 29, 2004 at 10:42 AM
fgwilson@sbcglobal.net <mailto:fgwilson@sbcglobal.net>

    "Masters of Terror" is available on the Internet Archive as part of
    this pathbreaking video documentary collection!

You have seen the warm-up, and now it's time for the main event.

See the video from which Michael Moore borrowed "Fahrenheit 9/11:"

that video is Alex Jones' (infowars.com) "911: the Road to Tyranny,"
available now on the

Internet Archive, along with its sequel, "Masters of Terror."


The following collection represents a value of over $200. If you were to
inform Alex Jones

of its existence, he would mightily cheer. In fact I encourage you to do
so. Watch, learn, and

most of all, organize (anti-Patriot Act kits available at
http://infowars.com -- join the

hundreds of cities which have thrown out the Patriot Act,

as Alex Jones did in his home of Austin)!

Subject:      Amir Sulaiman: Poet on Audio
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed

A native of Rochester, New York, Amir Sulaiman began writing poetry at
the age of twelve. In 1996, at the age of eighteen, he left home to
begin performing at various colleges, universities, bookstores, and
coffee shops. Also in 1996 he began his college career at North Carolina
A&T in Greensboro, NC. During his sophomore year at A&T he published his
book Words of Love, Life, and Death. In his book, Sulaiman's poetry
stretches across the broad canvas of truth, struggle, relationships, and
poetry. During his stay at A&T he also started publishing his work in
literary journals like The Hazmat Review, All That Jazz, and Sauti Mpya.

After obtaining a B.A. in English from North Carolina A&T he moved to
Atlanta, G.A where he now resides. Soon after his move, he released his
debut CD Cornerstore Folklore to the spoken word scene. Cornerstore
Folklore is a pure spoken word CD. Without special effects or music, the

simple merit of excellent writing carries the project beautifully.
Cornerstore Folklore has been a success with the help of the Cornerstore
Folklore Tour, which reached such cities as D.C., NY, Oakland, San
Francisco, Norfolk, Richmond, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Raleigh,
Greensboro, and others.

In addition to writing and recording Amir gives presentations and
workshops. His presentation, The 40 Year Itch: The Harlem Renaissance,
The Black Arts Movement and Modern Spoken Word, compares and contrast
the climaxes of spoken word in American History. He also works with
children teaching the elements of poetry and helping them find their
voices in verse. In his Communication Workshop, he explores the the
intricacy of human language and the process by which ideas travel from
one mind to another.

Amir Sulaiman is an artist who paints the world with a beautiful stroke
and unique voice. With his words, he allows the listener to see what he
sees and feel what he feels. It would be safe to expect many more great
projects to come from this young mind.
