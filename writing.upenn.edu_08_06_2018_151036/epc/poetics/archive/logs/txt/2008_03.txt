Baseball does well in the hispanic Caribbean, not so much in the
Dutch, French or English.

For pure mayhem short of total war, nothing tops the ba, the national
sport of the Orkneys.

Do you count Australia in that geographical locus, Mark?  I can think of
people who might object to that designation.

Possibly exported by James Hardy "thrice-transported" Vaux?

(One of the curious sidelights that I encountered while tracking cant across
the centuries was that the term "gallus" [a spelling of 'gallows' as an
intensifier] seems only to run in Glasgow and New York.

Odd that, but.

I also reluctantly came to the conclusion that I'll have to postpone a
proper consideration of George Washington Matsell to the book *after MORTS
AND BLOWENS -- despite the lovely moment when he and Mike Walsh and
"Captain" Isiah Rynders and Ned Buntline came face to face across the
barricades in the course of the Astor Place Shakespeare Riots.

Makes you to seriously think, nah?

(Judy says that my theory that Rynders topped Mike Walsh on the orders of
Boss Tweed ... "lacks scholarly justification".)

i find these stations really exciting.

commercial radio and big media seem so messed up these days. so away in the
castle. controlled by corporations that have their own 'artists' doing the
corporate thing. corporate protégés. sort of like the movie stars of old
during the 'big studio' days.

internet radio and the internet more generally don't have to do that and
provide ways to publish that don't require corporate approval. no wonder the
internet is so unpopular in those channels.

here's some more stations and info on internet radio: http://vispo.com/radio

In the ipod of memory, there's a phrase like "rereading is an
activity that works against the commercial and ideological habits of
our culture" (a loose paraphrase, which is probably missing
something, but it's the basic gist) in, I think, the introduction to
S/Z (Zed).
      That phrase, whether rightly or wrongly, gets at the heart of
Barthes for me, is my personal 'greatest hit' when his name comes up
(and even sometimes when it doesn't)--.
         Is the phrase true? Maybe not in any absolute sense, but
it's got a ring....

ROSENDAHL SAVES LEASE FOR BEYOND BAROQUE

Literary Arts Center to Keep its Home in Old Venice
City Hall



LOS ANGELES  -  Beyond Baroque, the nationally
acclaimed poetry and literary arts center, will keep
its home in the former Venice City Hall, thanks to the
actions of Councilmember Bill Rosendahl.
The City Council today unanimously approved a
Rosendahl motion directing city agencies to renew and
extend a low-cost lease, allowing Beyond Baroque to
keep its headquarters at 681 Venice Blvd. through
2032.

"Beyond Baroque is one of the last bastions of the
spoken word in Los Angeles," Rosendahl said. "It is
appropriate that it maintain its home and its special
relationship with the community of Venice, so long a
haven for poets, artists and writers."

The council action came after weeks of intense concern
by many in the literary arts community worried that
Beyond Baroque might lose its headquarters and be
forced to close or move from Venice, which it has
called home since 1968. City agencies had sought a new
policy that would have prohibited low-cost leases with
struggling arts organizations. Rosendahl intervened,
effectively saving Beyond Baroque from possible
extinction.

"We are extremely grateful to Councilman Rosendahl for
his support and for his leadership," said Fred Dewey,
director of Beyond Baroque. "Beyond Baroque is part of
Venice, and Venice is part of Beyond Baroque. I am
delighted we will be able to stay there, and I am
extremely grateful for the City's continued support
for the literary arts and for our public mission."

Beyond Baroque has been at its current location since
1979. Its most recent lease, approved in 1997, was set
to expire February 29. Rosendahl's motion directs the
Department of General Services to renew and extend the
existing lease for 25 years, at the current rate of $1
per year. The paperwork should be completed within 30
days.

Beyond Baroque is a non-profit poetry and literary
arts center with a national reputation for attracting,
showcasing and advocating for poets and writers. It
has played a significant role in helping Los Angeles
become an international arts capital, and has helped
to make Venice and Los Angeles a cultural destination.

Beyond Baroque offers free workshops and low-cost
readings and performances, maintains archives of Los
Angeles literature, publishes and sells magazines and
books, advocates for Los Angeles writers and artists,
and showcases public art projects. The organization
serves more than 300 writers and 10,000 residents per
year.

In exchange for its renewed lease, Beyond Baroque will
continue to provide those services, and pay any costs
needed to maintain, upgrade and landscape the
facility. The building served as Venice's City Hall
before the community joined the City of Los Angeles in
1925.

The most parochial game I know of is Trugo, which is only played in the
Melbourne suburb of Newport. It originated in the railyards, and is
basically an industrial version of croquet, involving big hammers and a
rubber thing called the trugo, which apparently you hit backwards between
your legs. I've never seen the game (nor do I know what a Trugo looks like)
but it has regular tournaments and the results are published in the local
newspaper, along with other curiosities like the rehearsal times of the
Yarraville Mouth Organ Band, the biggest (and perhaps the only) mouth organ
orchestra in Australia.

Life would actually be a lot duller without parochialisms.

All best

Record-high Ratio of Americans In Prison

By David Crary

For the first time in U.S. history, more than one of every 100 adults
is in jail or prison, according to a new report documenting America's
rank as the world's No. 1 incarcerator. It urges states to curtail
corrections spending by placing fewer low-risk offenders behind bars.

"thought crime" charges brought in UK

Western so-called democracies, in particular, are supposed to have
governments that are servants of the people, whereas, in fact, the
opposite is true. Under the guise of doing what's best for us or
ensuring our security, governments are exercising more and more
control over our lives.

Granting Immunity Rewards Lawlessness

By Andrew P. Napolitano

There was and is no U.S. law, and there is nothing in the
Constitution, that authorizes warrantless wiretaps on Americans in the
United States, no matter with whom they speak or e-mail. In fact, both
the law and the Constitution prohibit such surveillance without a
search warrant.

Hi Donald!
I'm excited with our meeting again, years after Aachen. It is also interesting that POETICS is bringing old friends together. Yeah, S/Z could be a better point to begin to understand the writerly. I thought Amanda might be interested in fuller versions of frequently cited Barthes' essays like "The Death of the Author", anyway.
On my presence at Poetics: I found my way into the community through Wryting-L.
Glad to be with you again, VIRTUALLY.
Obododimma.

Welcome Obododimma

We met in Aachen one summer. Glad to see you interested in the discussion here.

On Barthes: most do start of with S/Z for an introduction to the concept of writerly reading -- from that point forward I find all his work compelling, even breath-taking.

Maybe we like to occupy places where they have baseball?

Nope, that doesn't work either.

With all due respect to Ron Silliman--I'm sure that he worked and
works hard--I think that one of the reasons that we feel bored and
unable to read is that his voice so dominated the discussion of
Langauge poetry. In that sense the Grand Piano is a really great step
in letting in the other voices.

What becomes apparent to me as I read issue 2 is that Silliman was
really excited about getting poets to think, whearas a lot of the
other poets were really excited about breaking down thinking and
questioning their consciousnesses--and of course those two things must
go together. It's when they don't go together actally, that is when
thinking stops or stagnates or whatever...

Some good quotes from Grand Piano #2

"As if verbally purgingmy recent past would unbury he feeling of
living in the present. On the first page of everyday life, Lefebvre
prooposes that one pick a day, do some reasearch, learn what happened
as a recorded event." -Carla Harryman

"Writing is a creature twisting in the nettings she gets caught up in.
Human beings are those creatures 'whose very landscape is
alive'...later the words in our tongues come out muddy. Pieces of our
bodies stick to the city map'." --Carla Harryman

"Walking around J Church tracks in the curve between 22nd and 20th,
through backyard flowers and thoughts, building memory into an edge."
--Kit Robison

 "In looking at Watten's writings, I have to say that the
transformation is not accomplished as effortlessly as he says.
Incompletion (subjectivity) does not disappear obligingly upon being
named. One of the most persistant, and compelling features of the work
are traces of his subjectivity, violently erased." --Watten on
himself.

"-The betrayal of the sef?
-Yes, that's what I meant.
-To what degree was your participation in the Language school a
vindication of the self. A revenge of the self, maybe. A counter
assult of the self. Biff bam boom!"
...
"Like in your family?"
Steve Benson interviewing himself

Is there a break among those interested in Barthes between those who focus
on his work before *The Pleasure of the Text* and those who focus on this
work and what comes after.

S/Z and The Pleasure are antithetical works. In the former, almost every
word or phrase is determined by codes (Balzac being a supreme manipulator of
Middle Class codes); The Pleasure is an exploration of that aspect of
reading which escapes codes.

Murat,

True, but that "almost' is key for Barthes "early" and "late": the fact that not every word or phrase is code-determined is precisely why there is, for Barthes, "pleasure." Indeed, he argues that there is pleasure reveling in the codes themselves...

Landis Everson was born in 1926 in Coronado, California. When he got to Berk=
eley in the late 1940s=C2=A0he met Jack Spicer, Robert Duncan, and Robin Bla=
ser and they called themselves The Berkeley Renaissance. Landis studied with=
 Josephine Miles and was the editor of the Berkeley student literary magazin=
e, Occident. Miles called Landis and his friends The Museum School of poetry=
. Duncan was influenced by Landis and called him The Poet King in letters to=
 Spicer. Spicer admired the=20
ease with which Landis wrote poetry, and wrote to Robin Blaser that Landis w=
as a god for each member of the group. In 1951, while finishing a Master's a=
t Columbia, Landis met John Ashbery who admired his poems and would later pr=
int selections from "The Little Ghosts I Played With" in Locus Solus. The su=
bject of Landis's Master's thesis was an imaginary seventeenth century poet=20=
called Sir William Bargoth, for which Landis concocted both the poems and th=
e commentary=20
upon them. In 1955, while Karl Shapiro's teaching assistant at Berkeley, Lan=
dis had the first of six appearances in Poetry, two appearances in the mid-F=
ifties, followed by four appearances five decades later. In the late 1950s h=
e was introduced to a younger generation of poets that included Joanne Kyger=
 and John Wieners. In 1960, Landis replaced Robert Duncan as the third membe=
r of a Sunday poetry group that was run by Jack Spicer and met in Robin Blas=
er's apartment in San Francisco. Dictated serial poetry was the order of the=
 day. Landis wrote the sequences "Postcard from Eden" and "The Little Ghosts=
 I Played With," a few months too late to be considered for Don Allen's anth=
ology The New American Poetry. Then the group stopped meeting, and Landis, w=
ho was only writing for his friends, turned to painting, and renovating hous=
es. He didn't write anything for 43 years, during which time none of his poe=
try appeared in print. Then in the fall of 2003, Ben Mazer contacted Landis=20=
to inquire about Landis's poems, which Mazer planned to include in a feature=
 on the Berkeley Renaissance for Fulcrum. Over the next three years, the las=
t of his life, Landis would compose over 300 poems, comprising the book Ever=
ything Preserved, which won the Emily Dickinson Award=20
from the Poetry Foundation, and Book of Valentines, still in manuscript form=
. In the spring of 2006 Landis had the first in a series of strokes, which l=
eft him=C2=A0incapable of writing any more poems. He took his life on Novemb=
er 17th last year.

its eyes from sleep. All six legs flexed

which filled the house. We came in

until the house looked clean. But
how to kill a spider, which wasn=E2=80=99t ours?
It was masturbating like hell with every leg. Did

Subject:      Lefty O'Doul brings pro baseball to Japan/baseball arrives in
              Japan in 1878
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

As Steve D. pointed out, baseball was played in Japan  well before the
occupation, actually having been first introduced in 1878.  I pasted in the
Wikipedia history below.



Also here (forgive a rather crude paste job)--Lefty O'Doul's colorful
account of his starting the Japanese Professional Leagues as they are known
today--

Lefty went to Japan on the same All Star team that Moe Berg was on, whom I
wrote of here before, when Berg skipped a game and during a walk around the
city, climbed atop a building and took the home movies of Tokyo  that were
later used in the planning of Gen. Doolittle's fire bombing raids in WW2.
Those home movies opened the doors to Berg's career as a spy in the OSS ,
which sent him on a mission to hear a Heisenberg lecture In Switzerland
during the War to see if he could glean whether or not the Germans were
working on an Atomic Bomb.  (Berg said, correctly, that they weren't.)

The biggest star on the 1932 tour was Babe Ruth, who created a sensation
wherever he went.  The Babe provided the cover, so to speak, for Berg's side
line mission.  Between the Babe, Moe and Lefty, one can see that it was an
eventful tour in many different ways, and had quite a huge impact on the
histories of the Japanese-American political, military and cultural scenes
that continues today.

(I wrote previously how Jack Spicer and Yasusada are linked via Berg to
Hiroshima and baseball, and also the radio,.  This is now a chapter in my
ongoing  "Annals of the New Extreme Experimental American Poetry.")

During this period, American All Star teams would take World Tours, acting
as Ambassadors of Good Will and traveling to Latin America, Europe and
Australia.  These tours were done in the spirit of the hugely popular
"barnstorming" method and style of showmanship,  putting on exhibitions
modeled loosely on those pioneered by  airplane demonstrations of trick
flying. These were usually perfrormed by Americans trained as pilots during
WW1, bringing the "Miracle of Flight" to rural areas across the continent.
(Many of the pilots had begun their flying careers with the Royal Canadian
air forces, before the US entered the War in 1917.   William Faulkner used
his experiences of this in his early works, especially Pylon,which is about
the barnstormers.  In the 1950's, this was retitled and made into an
excellent film by Douglas Sirk,  Tarnished Angels.)

 These  barnstorming tours tours were not only influential  going overseas,
but coming from elsewhere into  the USA as well.  Musical tours like those
of  Hawiian bands  in the 1920's  introduced the "Hawiian Guitar" to
Appalachian musicians, whose modifications of it had a huge influence in
Country Western music, developing into the pedal steel guitar.

Lefty is interviewed in one of the greatest baseball books ever, and with
Ring Lardner's baseball writings, my favorite,  Lawrence Ritter's The Glory
of their Times which was reissued again in 2006.  There's also a cassette
tape edition of the original interviews which I have--
incredible to hear the actual voices one has come to know so well from
simply having read the book several times a year for years and years.

Lefty O'Doul has the fourth highest lifetime batting average .349. At the
time of this interview, as he remarked:

"Only guys ever did better are Cobb, Hornsby and Joe Jackson.  So you might
say I have the highest batting average of any man living.  Yeah--the rest of
the guys are dead."

There is a story of a baseball player--name not given in the account I
read--who was asked to go on one of these tours of the World.  The ball
player was rather dubious, so the promoter added on some more incentives and
said that, of course, all the ball players were bringing their wives.

The ball player still looked dubious.

"Who wouldn't want to get paid to play some exhibition games and get to take
a trip around the World?"

"Can't we go somewhere else?" the ball player asked.

Lefty O'Doul:



Hiroshi Hiraoka, who was in America studying engineering, introduced the
game to his co-workers at Japan's national railways in 1878. He and his
coworkers created the first baseball team the Shimbashi Athletic Club and
dominated other teams which popped up in Japan. However it wasn't until the
team from Tokyo University started playing when the sport took hold in
Japanese Culture. In 1896 the team defeated an American team from the
Yokohama Country and Athletic Club 29 to 4. It was the first recorded
international baseball game in Asia. After that defeat several other
colleges in Japan picked up the sport and it quickly spread throughout
Japan. Since then teams from Japan have crossed the ocean to learn from
their American counterparts. Waseda
University<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waseda_University>was one of
the first college teams to cross the ocean to improve their
skills (SABR). In 1905 the team traveled to the United States where they
played college teams from around the U.S. It wasn't before long that several
other universities in Japan started making similar trips. From that point on
the baseball phenomenon in Japan was complete with U.S. baseball teams
traveling to Japan for games.
In 1913 and in 1922, American baseball stars visited Japan and played games
against university students. They also held clinics on technique. A retired
major league player, Herb Hunter, made eight trips to Japan from 1922 to
1932 organizing games and coaching clinics.

NEW AMERICAN PRESS is pleased to announce the release of the The Other Chekhov, an anthology of lesser-known Chekhov stories introduced by contemporary writers.

   Chekhov is widely known as a master of the subtle and the quotidian, but many of the more than 500 stories he published in his lifetime are deeply grounded in the realities of war, poverty, and violence that shaped daily life in nineteenth-century Russia. This volume presents ten of these masterpieces introduced by writers such as Pinckney Benedict, Fred Chappell, Christopher Coake, Benjamin Percy, Jeff Parker, and David R. Slavitt. Click here to see what Pinckney has to say.

  Reviews are forthcoming at The Potomac, Rain Taxi, Philly's Irish Times, somewhere in Italy, and perhaps at The Literary Review. Copies are $15.95, and you can order with a credit card from Amazon here, or direct from NEW AMERICAN PRESS with a check or money order here.

NEW  AMERICAN PRESS is pleased to announce the release of the The Other
Chekhov, an  anthology of lesser-known Chekhov stories introduced by contemporary
writers.

Chekhov is widely known as a master  of the subtle and the quotidian, but
many of the more than 500 stories he  published in his lifetime are deeply
grounded in the realities of war,  poverty, and violence that shaped daily life in
nineteenth-century Russia.  This volume presents ten of these masterpieces
introduced by writers such as  Pinckney Benedict, Fred Chappell, Christopher
Coake, Benjamin Percy, Jeff  Parker, and David R. Slavitt. Click here to see what
Pinckney has to  say.

Reviews are forthcoming at The Potomac, Rain  Taxi, Philly's Irish Times,
somewhere in Italy, and perhaps at The Literary  Review. Copies are $15.95, and
you can order with a credit card from Amazon  here, or direct from NEW AMERICAN
PRESS with a check or money order  here.

Eric,

  Not sure if this is a help, but I have some brand new work dealing with the textual material of the 'cup poems.' More than happy to share them with you. Backchannel if this sounds like it could help you.

  Best for now,

  Warren

Wow.

That ( http://bigbridge.org ) is a different and much deeper approach to an
online pub than many another I've seen. The diveristy and depth of this
issue of Big Bridge is remarkable. I've looked at three things so far, and
each of them has been captivating (Ingrid Swanberg's writing about d.a.
levy, Jane Dalrymple Hollo's 'game with no rules', and an overview of
Berkeley Daze).

I look forward to checking out more of it. And, Michael: thanks very
much--congratulations on creating both an unusual and notable online
publication.

Thank you very much  for asking the question--
I'd also like to know what's being taught and thought regarding the Poems--

since late last summer i've been working on a series of pieces growing out
of and around  the appearance of the Poems in book form, as well as via
selected poems being quoted prior to that in various media-- and also their
various receptions via reviews, blogs, articles and as well this e-list--

Wordforword will be publishing one of these pieces, "Waterboarding,
Translation and Poetry," which links the waterboarding  the 15th Century
French poet Francois Villon underwent numerous times with the same technique
being employed today on the detainees--and how poetry is produced in
relation with "being forced to speak" even more than "being censored" into
silence--

these pieces (called for now "Annals") are comprised of various
elements--usually i use examples from the poems of various writers, or of
the situations created by the poems' publications and receptions--in
relation with other  aspects of "poetics" and other American discourses,
along with various kinds of documentary materials from history, the
military, the Media--

In many pieces i'l employ photographs and documents found on-line or in
print publications, to "show" several different ways in which the image of
Guantanamo itself is not as "isolated" a phenomenon as it's physical site is
meant to invoke--but instead a symptom in language and image of the society
which is "paying for this" in the trillions of dollars and thousands of its
own lives and forcing millions of others also to "pay for it"--in every way
imaginable--

a long piece i am very close to completing for example involves the
"Projections" exhibition of Jenny Holzer and the recent announcement that
for the most docile of detainees, there will be movies shown and classes
offered in Pashto, Arabic and English--the commander who made this
announcement said also that a wide range of subjects including Oceanography
is also being gradually introduced--to be taught to students who are
shackled to the floor but allowed to site on hard plastic chairs at
non-threatening desks--and may even be allowed to know they are "living"
close to the famous Bay--

the Commander speaks of using "the humanities" to help calm down the anger
which can erupt and be a threat to the guards--

as well, he notes--this wil give the selected detainees "something to look
forward to every day"--

this method of "winning hearts and minds" and using the "humanities" to
"pacify" the "population" one may find operating also in the Holzer
exhibition--

which, curiously, has elicited, similarly to the Guantanamo poems, reviews
and responses which use eerily over and over almost identical phrases and
"key words"--which it turns out Holzer herself also uses--

the interrelationship of "captive audiences" and "free" citizens reveals the
ever more sinister direction of the manipulation of a "New Extreme
Experimental American" pacification and conformity in the breakdown of
identities in order to produce the appearance of "liberty" and "resistance"
and "opposition" in a system whose primary symbols have become the Twin
Towers, Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, The Green Zone, New Orleans and the Border
Fence, coupled with the billions poured into the creation of the world's
largest prison (Gaza) and the Israeli Walls--

many of the responses with the poems--often based not on reading the book
itself, but going by the reviews and quotes from one or two poems--were as
confining and isolating as Guantanamo in a sense, in that the poems and
poets were judged as "bad poetry by bad people translated badly"
("non-literary translators") as well as being a "product of the
Pentagon"--and so were removed altogether from being "poems" "worthy" of
consideration--(let alone the beneficent administerings of "the humanities"
or  the more elite  "post humanities")--

a great deal of the "criticism" rhetorically was replays (including by
"avant" poets)--of standard Bush-style "renditions" of the poems and poets
as "enemies" who are at some level sub-human, less than qualified for any
kind of "rational" reception of a "civilised" nation and its poets and
poetries' "standards"--which are of course to be assumed to be the most
"radical" "open"  and "free" in the world--

i began by thinking of the Guantanamo Poems as the first example of a "New
Extreme Experimental American Poetry"--a poetry far more "radical"  than any
previous American form--

that is, the book reveals, "lays bare the mechanisms," of an American Poetry
produced out of the long series of "shock and awe" and  "reconstruction" of
the as much as possible erased identities of the detainees--systemically
arrived at by a wide variety of tortures and the complete abandonment of any
national or International Law--

through years of torture, under the most extreme conditions, what will
humans "confess"--
(ironically some of the poems have been subjected to the sort of jeering
usually reserved for "confessional" poets--)--

 the forms of "censorship" through which the poems pass  exemplify what a
Russian artist has called "the fascism of language, which is not censoring
by silence, but by forcing one to speak"--

the methods used in terms of the much critiqued "non-literary translations"
themselves may be read as mirroring examples of "translating" given in the
non plus ultra "writing experiments" lists such as that of Charles
Bernstein--

the ways in which criticism of the poems was also accomplished by comparing
them with  the harsh  details of the poets' small biographical notes in the
book reflects ironically and in reverse as it were an attitude towards
biography one may find for example in Barrett Watten's review posted here
yesterday of a Lytle Shaw's new work on Frank O'Hara--

(the review is basically an "allegorical" "poem" regarding the unnamed
"subject," The Grand Piano--,which, while not named, is "produced" via the
absence through which its unnamed Presence "roars" into view and
hearing--Watten uses the review of someone else's book to focus on exactly
the kind of works he finds the most important being done, of which, if one
reads carefully, it is "obvious" that he is writing a sort of "promotional"
piece for The Grand Piano, which fits al the criteria that he produces as
the most "advanced" and basically "inevitable")

this method of "ironic"
. biographical  comparison is used to further diminish the poems--

much of the discourse responding to the discourse responding to the poems
"finishes off" rhetorically what is "left" of the "subject"--
the detainee Poems are vanished into a further isolation from both poetry
and "readability," mirroring the detainees' physical treatment--

when one thinks through the immense costs in terms of human life, trillions
of dollars, rhetoric and media employed in the "forcing to speak" of the
detainees in such a way that they will be further silenced--one finds from
all sides the American "Shock Doctrine" at work--

the poetry "establishments" serve the same functions as the military and the
torturers, the bounty hunters who "captured" the "enemy detainees" in the
first place--to collect American "bounty" monies--and "produce evidence" by
the forcing to speak into what becomes the amplification of a separation on
to the other sides of Walls --a speaking via distortions that becomes noise
that subsides into a background hum, and then into something so "normal"
that no one even really hears it all anymore--and it can no longer be
distinguished except with  the most sensitive listening devices whether it
is stil at least a minimal signal--or simply the "radio frequency echoes" of
erased identities drifting as scattered paticles among the ruined remains
and skeletal scrawls of carbon traces of what had been "carbon based
lifeforms"--

The Poems also participate in the shadowy worlds in which the "poetry of
witness" has been critiqued--critics who usually critique poetry of witness
as a form of "essentialism" in this case
found the Poems wanting in terms of that same essentialism--in that, due to
censorship and "non-literary" translations, the "essential" nature of the
poetry itself it  "absent"--and, bizarrely, what is deemed to have a minimal
form of "value" is the biogrpahies' narratives, which replace the "non-poems
by non-poets non-literarily translated" with   a spare itinerary and a
minimal "profile" of the poet as "documentary" compared to the "fictional"
nature of the verses--

in a peculiar manner, the criticisms of this nature evoke some of the
disturbing questions raised by the Yasusada Poems--

biographical details are turned to as "evidence" that the poets do in fact
"exist," while their poems are treated as "fictions" "produced by the
Pentagon"--

So that an "anonymous" Authority  is claimed to be the "Author" of the poems
which have been "produced" by a series of persons, a "collective" as it
were, made up of the detainees, the guards, the various military and
psychological agents, the "non-literary" translators, the military censors
and the lawyers who have worked with an immense courage against all odds to
represent the detainees--


(are the Gunatanamo poets members of an exclusive "coterie"--with their
"extended non-family"  of guards, torturers, medical and psychological
doctors, lawyers, translators---their own "special relationship" with
"codes" "known only to themselves"--for the purposes of "living resistantly
within the confines of a restrictive cultural-social site?")

in many ways the "production" and "reception" of the poems by American
agencies becomes in itself the "rendition" of the detainees and their
writings from one institution of torture to another--from Guantanamo to that
of the tortured language of various  "poetics" of American methods of
reading and writing--revealing in this torturous series of tortured
critiques the ways in which American "poetics" operate in tandem with the
systems and institutions of the corporate-military-state--to produce
"distinguishing characteristics" of "subcultures and their signages" which
can be developed for the production of anything including volumes of
poetry--

while at the same fulfilling the role of the "humanities" as providers of
"something to look forward to every day" in which "escapism," "oppositional
readings" "language skills" and the teaching of oceanography to shackled
detainees who do, indeed, live close to "beautiful Guantanamo Bay"--forms
the "curriculum" necessary for becoming a "civilized" member of the new
Post-Humanist societies of the Living Dead--

who, sometimes at night, wafted by the breezes stirring across the Bay,
sensed through even the thick sound proof headphones and the light proof
goggles of the detainees shackled in solitary confinement for months on
end--may still hear the happy strains of the Bay's Immortal Classic song--

"Guantanamera"

I once spent five years or so living in Japan, and when I first
arrived (Aug. '79) the whole country was in a baseball frenzy
that went on for weeks--and that was over the playoffs for
the high-school baseball season. And that happened (and I
imagine continues to happen) every year.

Each issue of COURT GREEN features a dossier section on a special
topic or theme. For our sixth issue, we are seeking poems in the form
of letters, correspondence, epistles, and the like. We would like to
see both poetry that pushes the boundaries of the epistle form and
poetry that is firmly rooted in that tradition, as well as interesting
and literary letters that may not normally be considered poems, but
are poetic. All manner of such will be considered as long as the work
addresses, in some way, a particular recipient(s). We are not looking
for critical/academic works at this time.

Submissions for dossier and regular sections of the magazine are
welcome.

If you would like to submit poems for either or both sections, our
submission period is March 1-June 30 of each year.

Please send no more than five pages of poetry. We will respond by
August 31.

Murat,

True, but that "almost' is key for Barthes "early" and "late": the
fact that not every word or phrase is code-determined is precisely why
there is, for Barthes, "pleasure." Indeed, he argues that there is
pleasure reveling in the codes themselves...

Thanks, Tyrone and Tom -- Barthes' definitely "sidesteps" the rigidity
assigned to his "codes," he *plays* with "codes," as if signifiers to be
messed with.  I have a great deal of "pleasure" in reading both S/Z and The
Pleasure of the Text, in that they both allow us to play with and work (as
readers) with their texts and others.

Newport and South Melbourne.

A trugo (cf "True Go") is a nickname for a large heavy (6" - 8" diameter) ru=
bber bumper off a railtruck. The game is played on a turf pitch, and the ide=
a is to hit the washer between two posts - a true go.

Although my experience was that it was to consume small glasses of beer and=

 the people who played the game.

Melbourne suburb of Newport. It originated in the railyards, and is
basically an industrial version of croquet, involving big hammers and a
rubber thing called the trugo, which apparently you hit backwards between
your legs. I've never seen the game (nor do I know what a Trugo looks like)
but it has regular tournaments and the results are published in the local
newspaper, along with other curiosities like the rehearsal times of the
Yarraville Mouth Organ Band, the biggest (and perhaps the only) mouth organ
orchestra in Australia.

Life would actually be a lot duller without parochialisms.

All best

I haven't been able to follow this whole thread, so this may have been said
already -- but one significant pressure that moved us from structuralism to
poststructuralism was precisely (or imprecisely) the recognition that there is
no code so rigid as to be fully determining -- there is always and everywhere

Kaurab's English language section is an effort to create a WIP
(work-in-progress) archive of Bengali Poetry (in translation) from India. It
also houses an interview section that intends to cover poets, young and
antique, around the world, thoughout the year. This archive update, the
first of its kind, also introduces a "Book Opener".

Please visit

Archiving is a difficult task, often underrated and overlooked.

But we stay committed to the cause and look forward to your comments to help
us serve ourselves better.

Agree. That's what Tom and Laura imply by the seeming arbitrariness of Barthes' application of the codes. However, my discussion with Murat was more about the extent to which Barthes does or does not "recognize" the role of pleasure in his early texts.

2 new Burning Deck titles are available from:
Small Press Distribution, www.spdbooks.org or orders@spdbooks.org
In Europe: H Press: www.hpress.no

1. vol. 51 of the =93BURNING DECK POETRY BOOKS=94:
CYRUS CONSOLE
Brief Under Water
Poetry, 64 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN13: 978-1-886224-87-2, original paperback $14
ISBN13: 978-1-886224-88-9, limited signed edition $20
Publication date: March 15, 2008

Brief Under Water is a sequence of 55 short passages that uses prose =20
narrative as a design element in a larger lyric structure. The title =20
refers to Kafka=92s 1919 Brief an den Vater, reflecting a struggle with =20=

the notion of literary inheritance. So does Console=92s sentence, =20
refined nearly to the point of anachronism, that owes a great deal to =20=

Melville and to Garnett=92s translations of  Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and =20=

Turgenev.

The book was written while the author supported himself as a =20
metalworker, housepainter, and waiter. The clashing of these =20
professional spheres contributed to the struggle outlined above. The =20
binary numbering (1, 10, 11, 100, 101=85) is meant to express his sense =20=

of movement-in-place.

=93[The] manuscript is terrific=85.The sensory detail of the writing, =
not =20
surrealistic, not plot-oriented, is not even with the sense of =20
'leading anywhere' but accumulating both detail and expansion at =20
once, opening a floating, fascinating, sometimes apparently violent =20
yet detached terrain, as if not the author's psyche=85but the world =20
itself=85 seen from at once extreme and mundane edges.=94=97Leslie =
Scalapino


2. volume 20 of SERIE D=92ECRITURE:
Caroline Dubois
You Are the Business
translated from the French by Cole Swensen
Poetry, 104 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 978-1-886224-86-5 original paperback $14
Publication date: March 15, 2008

C=92est toi le business uses an eerie cadence to examine the =20
construction of identity in a media-saturated world. Focusing on =20
icons of cult film from Simone Simon to Blade Runner, she develops a =20
haunting collage of overlay and echo, populated by unsettling twins =20
(a =93sister,=94 a clone, a verbal stutter), that evokes the doubles =
with =20
which a society based on representation invests us.
      In =93talala=94 for instance, the terms of identity taken from the =
=20
film Blade Runner (human being vs. =93fake=94 or =93android=94) are used =
to =20
raise questions of authorship: do phrases come to us or do we make =20
them, and if they come to us, then from where?
      Always conscious of the role that language plays in the =20
mediation between self and media, the book is poetry in its =20
linguistic freedom, film criticism in its thematic aspects, prose in =20
its physical shape. But it always pushes language toward new sensual =20
territory.

      Caroline Dubois lives in Paris and teaches at the Ecole des =20
Beaux-Arts in Rueil-Malmaison. She has translated American poets like =20=

Norma Cole and Deborah Richards. C'est toi le business is her most =20
recent book (2005). Earlier books include Je veux =EAtre physique [I =20
want to be physical; P.O.L., 1999], Arr=EAte maintenant [Stop now; =20
Editions de l=92Attente, 2001] and Mal=E9cot [Ed. contrat maint, 2003].
       Cole Swensen=92s recent books include The Book of a Hundred =20
Hands (2005), The Glass Age (2007), Noon  Try, Oh, and Such Rich =20
Hour. She has translated Pierre Alferi, Olivier Cadiot, Pascalle =20
Monnier, Jean Fr=E9mon and others. Both her poetry and her translations =20=

have won many prizes.=

Friends and fellow poets at Buffalo Poetics,

I've been lurking lately, but I am very excited to
announce (officially) the forthcoming release of my
first book, _Caramboles_, due out in October 2008 from
Argol Editions (Paris). The book is a bilingual
collection, and you can read the French versions of
the book presentation and my bio here:

book:
http://www.argol-editions.fr/f/index.php?sp=liv&livre_id=33

bio:
http://www.argol-editions.fr/f/index.php?sp=livAut&auteur_id=83

You'll find the English version of the book
presentation (not quite as good as the French blurb,
I'm afraid) on my blog, here:
http://www.alexdickow.net/blog/article/110/announcing-caramboles-forthcoming-caramboles-a-paraitre

Finally, if you'd like to read a few recent poems, you
can try Sitaudis:

Apologies for cross-posting, and thanks for your time!
Amicalement,
Alex

for those interested in looking at a REAL NAZI instead of imagined ones

Lady Bunny posted this to her blog on February 28th about the death of
William F. Buckley.
Here's her post:
http://ladybunny.net/blog/2008/02/real-william-f-buckley.html

Here's the post in case that link doesn't work:

In the precious "he was an intellectual conservative who passed away"
obituaries that appeared, no one seems to want to say that he advocated
mandatory TATTOOING of people who were HIV positive in the 80's. MANDATORY.

 He wanted to FORCE everyone who was HIV+ to be tattooed, so the general
public would be able to easily identify --- thanks to those tattoos --- just
who was "infected" and "dangerous." The Good People could run and hide! The
esteemed William F. Buckley advocated forced, permanent physical markings
for people who were HIV+.

Nazi Germany's yellow stars and pink triangles, anyone? Not really...those
stars and triangles the Nazis instigated were sewn onto clothes. Clothes can
be discarded. The esteemed Mr. Buckley demanded permanent markings on
people's flesh.

Why is this important so many years later? Because he was so socially
connected back then with politicians, media figures, and NYC's high society
in the 80's that his horrifying views were given credence. And were
seriously discussed. When people were frightened they looked for help from
people they trusted.

And before anyone tries to say that people were ignorant then, and that
we've all learned better in the interim, here comes Adolf Buckley in 2005
(in the National Review) boasting about having come up with the idea and
suggesting it should still be implemented --- even making fun of the
Concentration Camp connection. Har de har, Nazis! Heehee, Buchenwald jokes!
(http://www.nationalreview.com/buckley/wfb200502191155.asp)

I'm proud to say I was the one in ACT-UP who delivered his home address for
picketing purposes back in the day. And I'm happy to realize that his
neo-Nazi ideas were perceived as so stupid in 2005 that no one noticed when
he said them then, or even remembers them now.

In the downtown NYC world in which I live, people often say how awful it is
that "The Old New York Is Dying." Sometimes it isn't so awful. Some parts of
The Old New York were really, really shitty. What do you do when you find
yourself in the room with something so shitty? I don't know about you, but I
happily flush the toilet.

Mr. Buckley wanted to FORCIBLY tattoo everyone who was HIV+ back in the
80's. He STILL wanted to 20 years later. One word for that: Fascist. Who
gives a fuck about his magazine, or his fashion-plate society wife and her
friends, or his upper-crust, erudite way with words? Hey, Mussolini made the
trains run on time, and Hitler could paint a nice picture, I've heard.

He made his legacy.

He made his epitaph, too: RIP, Asshole.

One of the most interesting interviews I've ever seen in my life is William
F. Buckley interviewing Gloria Steinem for TV.  You might be able to find it
online.  It's about twenty years old is my guess.  My local library here in
Philadelphia has it on video cassette and I HAD TO SEE IT, of course!  I
remember thinking when first seeing it on the shelf, "REALLY!?!  HOW WEIRD!"

And weird it was!  I wound up watching it about 20 times, FASCINATED by
these two very different iconic forces sitting there together.  What was
obvious, IN FACT VERY OBVIOUS, was that Buckley really didn't know who the
hell he was interviewing.  He had a lot of information like a lot of people
do about Gloria Steinem that was mostly based on IDEAS about who she is, and
WHY she "is the way she is," and it's all mostly wrong.  For instance he
asks in this flippant kind of tone about her father, wanting to know what
her relationship with her father was like, DO YOU LOVE YOU FATHER OR WHAT?,
kind of thing, the tone leading the listeners for a response that would
indicate maybe she's a man hater AND HERE'S THE REASON WHY.  But Gloria
Steinem in her clear, honest, ZEN style didn't flinch, DID NOT FLINCH at his
tone and launched into a beautiful story about her father, and who he was,
and how important he was to her.

Buckley of course was not just conservative about gender, but very much so
about class.  It was interesting hearing Steinem, and watching Buckley as
she talked about class.  At one point she told this marvelous story about
going to her high school reunion in Toledo and her college reunion at Smith
in the same year.  She said that the contrast taught her so much about the
strength of her working class roots that she had wanted to always remember.
She said that her old friends in Toledo understood feminist practice and
life practice better than her friends with degrees in Women's Studies
because THEY KNEW the difficulties and unfairness of having to work full
time, THEN also take care of kids, cook dinner, do laundry, etc.  It was a
nice moment, and made me think of friends I have in Philadelphia who work
with The Global Women's Strike who ACTUALLY work every single day helping
women get medical care for themselves and their children, and work at
fighting with them in Family Court over DHS bullshit, and set up groups to
help care for prostitutes with AIDS and so much more.  Almost ALL of the
women at The Global Women's Strike are working class, or from working class
backgrounds.

Another BRILLIANT moment in the interview is when Buckley was CLEARLY
irritated by the fact that when Steinem turned 40 she made a very public
announcement about it.  She answered yet again with that disarming, calm
tone, "Well, women have been hiding their age for years and I wanted
everyone to see what a woman looks like when she turns 40."  It's a
marvelous interview from start to finish!  What's especially good is that an
angry, nasty conservative like Buckley asks the right kinds of questions for
his crowd who think they have all of these things figured out.  And it's
PERFECT that it's Gloria Steinem because she's such a tower of focus that
cannot be toppled.

Gloria Steinem's calm and intelligent interview style reminds me of another
hero of mine Faye Wattleton, former head of Planned Parenthood.  I've seen
Wattleton in several interviews about abortion where she has had to deal
with some seriously ANGRY pro-life people and she ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS winds
up saying things that throw them completely off track.  Like, "So are you
going to take care of these children yourself?  Do you have a very roomy
house, I hope so because you're going to need a lot of room."  Very calm,
smart, full of statistics, she's a genius.  In fact here is a direct
Wattleton quote, "Whoever is providing leadership needs to be as fresh and
thoughtful and reflective as possible to make the very best fight."

Hello List:

Many of you wrote to me after this initial call for work was posted to =
this list and other places on the Internet. Now, I write to remind you =
that the deadline for contributions has been extended and if you are one =
of those people with whom I have corresponded about sending work yet you =
haven't gotten around to actually sending me the work--please consider =
doing so at this time. Hard copy is best.=20

The reading period for this project has been extended until 3/31/08. So =
that gives you about a month to put something together and send it my =
way. If you remain confused or worried about imagining writing and =
thinking perhaps 'differently' than some of what's often meted out in =
'schools' of many kinds, or writing which imagines the whole school and =
schooling aspect of human experience otherly, send me a note and I'll =
catch you up on some of what people have sent and also some of what I =
hope people will send.=20

Please forward this call to others whom you think might be likewise =
inclined to send some work.

Thank you,

CALL FOR WORK

Imaginary Syllabi, a book-length project of contributions by multiple =
authors, aims to collect writings which investigate, uncover, examine, =
complicate, question, spoof, spark, incite, meditate, mediate, mix, =
sample, nettle, navigate, question, provoke, and otherwise (essentially) =
challenge pedagogical strategies pursuant to the work of teaching =
writing and other disciplines. Or, writings which dream up, concoct and =
explore fabulist fantasy syllabi for potential imagined or real =
classroom endeavors: Educational projects undertaken and employed =
(deployed) in and outside of official as well as mongrel "schools." =
Official spaces might harbor (or cultivate) the mongrel & vice versa.

=20

MATERIAL:

--Sample syllabi which have been implemented or might/could be =
implemented  AND the opposite of this condition: wholly fantastical =
stuff more suited to investigations in outer space and other =
socio-cultural vacuums.

=20

--Syllabi composed entirely of images or text or some combination of =
both. Syllabi may be scattered or comprehensive lists of pertinent, =
esoteric, weird or terribly useful URLs.=20

=20

--Documents from classroom practices which were successful, compelling, =
disturbing etc. and which their authors wish to share, distribute, make =
known.

--Essays/Syllabi which mention other teachers and communities of =
teachers &/or documents, critiques, etc. &/or explore and extend the =
work of other teachers and communities of teachers, theorists, scholars, =
activist, revolutionaries, radicals, & intellectual insurgents.... There =
is no intended fixed, predetermined or official meaning attached in this =
CFW to the word "teacher"; "A thing which shows or points something =
out."; teachers are sometimes not necessarily human organisms.=20

=20

--Writings which disclose, assay, weigh the idea of the "syllabus" =
itself.

=20

--Unimagined documents for unimagined learners among whom we would also =
group teachers / professors / instructors / mentors / advisors / and so =
on.

Points to Consider:

Imaginary Syllabi is primarily (though not exclusively) concerned with =

Holocaust Memoir Turns Out to Be Fiction - New York Times

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/books/03arts-HOLOCAUSTMEM_BRF.html?_r=1&ref=arts&oref=login---


The book "Mishcha's Memoire of the Holocaust years," a huge bestseller and
translated into 18 languages and made into a French film, turns out to be
fantasy which the "author" has been living out in fact her actual daily
reality.

 The realities which fiction creates and then are exposed as fictions become
in turn "new realities."   This latest revelation of how both an author and
a huge number of people across many languages and supplemented by the
cinema, may all be participating in a fantasy which in itself answers a real
deeply felt need and desire is the latest major  example of an "Author" who
in her own actual life lives her fantasy and becomes a leading
"spokesperson" for millions.

Keeping track of the number of invented authors and lives who are
continually turning up as well as the creators of "vribant new works"  and
nationally respected historians" and scholars who make use of a patchwork
quilt of plagiarisms, is a form of literary studies in its own right, one
which Bolano, Borges, Nabokov, Pessoa, Poe, Kierkegaard, Yasusada and a
myriad 18th century writers have all investigated in a multitude of ways.

One of the great effects of fictions is how they advise one of the realities
of the fictional becoming realities which have vast consequences in the
"real worlds" of history and economics, ideologies and religion, poetics and
propaganda.

This is why I felt on first reading Bolano  three years ago that his Chilean
world post 9/11/1973 is very instructive and illuminating in the USA's post
9/11/2001 versions of fascism and Naomi Klein's "disaster capitalism" using
Milton Friedman's "Shock Doctrine" which, first applied Pinochet's Chile, is
now being used in the USA on itself.

One of the difficulties with the critique of the self and the author is that
both author and self can easily be invented, and not once, but many times,
as "real"  historical authors for centuries  and  the fictional ones in
Bolano's work, demonstrate.  The heyday for this method of earning a living
as a writer was the 18th century, in which authors like "Daniel Defoe" were
known by a multitude of names, all thought to be different persons, whose
works when totaled up as the  "author" now known as Defoe number over two
hundred.

(One of the heteronyms of  Tagle-Ruis aka Carlos Weider in Bolano's Distant
Star, who is the novella's version of Lieutenant Ramirez Hoffman in  the
Nazi Literatures book is Jules Defoe.)

A few days ago I sent a letter in which thinking of "reading carefully" or
"attentively" I used the term "close reading," in regards to language poetry
(though I think Marjorie Perloff does do this), and Barry Schwabsky,
associating the term with Cleanth Brook's form of New Criticism, quite
rightly wrote back that that form of reading isn't the kind that is
understood to be applied to reading language writing.  I've never read
Brooks but recognize the form of reading Barry is thinking of, which isn't
what I meant, as I don't know how do that kind of Close reading. I thank him
for the correction. Though  I have wondered often  if one may actually use
any form of reading one wants to, if the "reader is the producer of their
own meanings" of the texts produced by a number of the language and language
influenced  authors who assert this.

Barry wrote:

This (Close reading) is not the best way to appreciate language poetry,
which opens up much more under a more free-floating field of attention. This
is something that I remember Ron Silliman writing about somewhere, though
someone else will have to supply a specific reference.

I had to laugh affectionately with this, as, if one looks at it--the
"free-floating attention" followed by "something that I remember Ron
Silliman writing somewhere," which "someone else will have to supply" the
reference for, doesn't seem to argue well for "free-floating attention" as a
method that will "stand up in court." (A standard good to bear in mind in
regards to various aspects of textuality, for sure!)

(When I first was reading language poetry and showed it to my wife, she
said--"Oh--yuppies with degrees on pot," to describe the effect of the
writing, which goes well with the "free floating attention" aspect, to be
humorous about it.)

I thought about this "free-floating form of attention" a lot the last few
days as I had usually associated it with "creative misreading,"  as wel as
much more profound examinations of it in Bachelard's writings.  Creative
misreading in itself is a great tool to use for the dislocations of authors
and texts and extending these into new realms of authorship, textuality and
reading.  I've tried keeping notebooks of al the words, titles and names
I've misread during the course of the day, which often produce names, titles
and ideas far more intriguingly attractive and chaotic than what usually
turns out to be the rather prosaic words of origin. Usually, though I start
laughing too hard and forget to write the titles of these "unknown
masterpieces" down.

I think a form of "creative misreading" carried into the "critical realm"
occurred here recently, with some interesting effects, which carry the
misreading into other areas of fictionality.

The discussion here provoked by the NY Times book review of Roberto Bolano's
Nazi Literatures of the Americas,  provided several examples of the ways in
which misreadings/readings of a few words can inspire the passionate
creation of new authors and areas of literature which had not existed until
the writer of a piece came along.  For example, two list writers read into
the review that its author is anti-Semitic and  one of these list members,
judging from the  review's description of a couple writers from Bolano's
book,  lept to the assumption that many of them must be "New Formalists."

The reviewer is actually a Gay writer and the winner of a Lambda Award.  She
has had quite  a distinguished professional career working  for a number of
publishers and journals including the Voice Literary Supplement, as well as
teaching and participating in writers colonies.  Granted, the literary
sphere she inhabits may not be the same that writers here  are interested in
or sympathetic with, yet  I think without reading more of her works
fictional as well as non-fiction, it seems rather presumptuous to smear her,
as well as idle speculation to determine without reading it what a book's
writers actually are.
On the other hand, these posts did something which is related with actual
events in literature concerning real persons, as well as the fictional
beings who inhabit Bolano's imagination.
That is, they created a fictional being out of an actual one, a new
"anti-Semitic" writer publishing in of all places, the New York Times,a feat
which is almost impossible to conceive. And as well, there was created for
Bolano's legacy the post-humous addition to his compendium  that of the
group of American New Formalist writers, though they  would not qualify for
entry in the "real sense" of the book.

These spontaneous creations are part and parcel of Bolano's vision of
literature at one point, that it "is a surreptitious form of violence, a
passport to respectability, and can, in certain young and sensitive nations,
disguise the social climber's origins."

    Yet there seem to be other and stranger motives behind some of the
violences done by authors to themselves and to others, ones which perhaps
and at times directly  have to do as much as with their readers as the
authors themselves.

The best selling Holocaust memoir, translated into 18 languages and made in
to a French film--now turns out to be a fantasy created by a woman who turns
out not to be Jewish. Yet obviously she has a great sympathy for the cause
which she has come to embody until now.  And obviously her readers, already
immensely invested in the realities which her fantasy is taking part in,
warmly welcomed her.

 It's not quite as bizarre as the The Education of Little Tree  the huge
bestseller taught across the US in schools  and a work beloved by the
Environmental Movement. Forrest Carter, the book's "American Indian" author,
turned out to be Asa Carter, former speech writer for the Segregationist
Governor George Wallace and had been a member of some White Suprematist
groups.

A huge number of fake Indians have produced their versions of New Age
Pan-Indianism
with quite a lot of success.

 The not-so-successful writer of gay and pornographic literature Timothy
Burrus became a best selling New Agey "Navajo" known to the world as
Nasdijj. His rise to fame began in 1999 when a story of his in Esquire won a
Timothy Dwight Award.  As (real Indian) Sherman Alexie writes in  "When the
Story Stolen Is Your Own," Nasdijj's prize winning story is basically a
thinly disguised copy of a story by Alexie which had also appeared in
Esquire, in 1993, and had launched Alexie's own career.

"Nasdijj" then is someone who is not only stealing a story, but in effect,
"walking in Alexie's shoes" in order to find, like Alexie, a huge readership
and success.


      Despite the exposures of these and many other fakes, the Fake Indian
Business continues to be a billion dollar a year one for non-Indians who
sell "Indian Crafts" and "Indian art work," and become "Native-American"
experts and teachers who exploit the fake ethnicity for gain and
advancement. Of course, for decades Indians could find the bones of their
actual grandparents on exhibit in museums throughout the USA.  An Indian
writer has written a piece on the Museum of the American Indian in
Washington D.C. as "A Monument to Amnesia" a brilliant title which explains
a great deal of monuments and the histories they "stand for."

A Palestinain writer suggested a couple years ago that this will be the
future of Palestinians--an almost entirely vanished people whose "arts and
crafts," "songs and dances," poetry, cuisine, music and traditions will be
adopted and exploited in all manner of ways by anthropolgists, hucksters,
and all sorts of bizarre fantasizers of the very people who exterminated
them, just as it is in the USA.

Then there is the interesting career of another writer, the terrorist and
later Prime Minister of Israel, Menachim Begin.  His Revolt:  Story of the
Irgun (US edition 1951) was widely used as a handbook by Al Queda in its
training camps in the earlier period of its development.  It's considered
one of the founding works of modern terrorrism, as its based on direct
experience and the development of many ideas  n great use today.

    Interestingly, Begin's Revisionist Zionists were attracted to Fascism
(for its anti-Communist, anti-Socialist attitudes and policies) in the
1930's, until the anti-Semitism of Hitler's regime had begun to become more
widely known of.

The Irgun and Stern gang were also the introducers of the car bomb to the
Middle East, which was famously used in the USA in the 1920's from Wall
Street to Milwaukee by primarily Anarchists.  When Anarchism was brutally
and effectively stamped into near non-existence by the Palmer Raids and
fledging FBI--car bombing passed to the gangsters of Chicago to keep it for
a while alive in the USA

  The example of the Irgun and Stern's successful uses of the car bomb
introduced to others in the Middle East has traveled world wide including
back to the USA in Oklahoma City, so that today it has become as its
historian  Mike Davis calls it, "the poor man's air force."

None of the writers in Bolano's Nazi Literatures of the Americas is any kind
of success on the scale of these authors.  Instead what Bolano does is chart
the careers and strange lives of a heterogeneous assortment of bizarre and
sometimes entertaining figures, whose lives are marked by an attraction to
the creation of texts, in forms ranging from mimeographed Soccer Fanzines to
expensive limited editions by Vanity publishers, with introductions by
lovers or friends of the author possessed by delusions of literary
grandeur.  These writers work in a wide variety of genre, as well as
creating a multitude of hybrid genres and in one case, that of an American
writer whose father was a friend of Charles Olson, attempting to write out
his demented conceptions of Projective and Non-Projective verse, which he
himself has not really studied but absorbed via process of distorted osmosis
by being the son of his father, friend of Olson.

In Distant Star and By Night in Chile, as well as The Savage Detectives,
Amulet and several short stories, Bolano also uses his fictional poets,
critics, editors and independent workshop teachers as commentators on the
actual historical literary scenes of Latin and Central America. The bizarre
effects of a real Olson on a fictional character can be turned around to
become, in terms of method,  the creation of literary criticism via the
fictional, which, in becoming someday a real "Bolanian method of criticism"
be used in turn on the fictions of others.

In and out of the stories flow a phantasmagoria of invented characters,
whose brief biographies are given among the book's appendices, along with a
bibliography for each author with a chapter in the book, and a heady and
crazy description of the bizarre and variously funded and appearing journals
to which they have contributed.

The strange thing is, that Bolano's inventions--inspired by those of Borges'
stories and his Book of Imaginary Beings--are not that different from the
very same kinds of lists and descriptions of obscure writers and
publications, little known precursors, dandies and thugs, dope addicts and
Old Family heirs who inhabit that amazing collection assembled with genius
and gusto by Ed Foster, Decadents, Symbolists & Aesthetes in America
Fin-de-Siecle American Poetry:  an Anthology.  Foster's book, though a
number of the writers are still well or somewhat known today, captures also
those long forgotten figures who played interesting and contributing roles
in the literary circles of their day, and whose lives and works are jammed
with a fervor and passion for literature and the arts and travel the equal
of many far more famous writers and bohemians, editors and poets, muckrakers
and translators of scandalous works.
      Reading this along side the Bolano is a doubled enjoyment, as one
careens among the "real" and the fictional writers, with their publications,
coteries, rivalries, friendships and causes.

Interesting bit of information you, guys: I'd just typed the word google in

Hey all, the 7th issue of 21 Stars Review is up, including work from Micah
Bateman, Allyson Boggess, Robert M. Detman, Glenn R. Frantz, D. E. Fredd, PJ
Nights Maurice Oliver, Steven D. Schroeder, and Jane Wong. Read it here:
http://sundress.net/21stars. It's short and sweet and tasty.

Submission info: We have a strong leaning toward work that uses constraints
(Oulipian or otherwise), innovative meter and form, or carefully executed
collage/cut-up techniques. Prose with amazing sentences will be preferred
over prose with unamazing sentences. Plotless or intricately- plotted very
short fiction (ideally under 1000 words) is also something we enjoy. We take
subs year-round but will be reading in December, March, June, and September.
So you'll be getting responses in those months.

Glad to have given you a laugh, David! I'm sure you'd have laughed the same=
 if I had been able to cite you chapter and verse on the Language poets' re=
flections on how to read poetry. Wouldn't that have been funny? But I can't=

 what I read (where "forget" means something like "subsume", maybe) though =
that doesn't mean I forget that I have read it. Anyway, it's true, the "cre=

ies which fiction creates and then are exposed as fictions become=0Ain turn=
 "new realities."  This latest revelation of how both an author and=0Aa hug=
e number of people across many languages and supplemented by the=0Acinema, =
may all be participating in a fantasy which in itself answers a real=0Adeep=
ly felt need and desire is the latest major  example of an "Author" who=0Ai=
n her own actual life lives her fantasy and becomes a leading=0A"spokespers=
on" for millions.=0A=0AKeeping track of the number of invented authors and =
lives who are=0Acontinually turning up as well as the creators of "vribant =
new works"  and=0Anationally respected historians" and scholars who make us=
e of a patchwork=0Aquilt of plagiarisms, is a form of literary studies in i=
ts own right, one=0Awhich Bolano, Borges, Nabokov, Pessoa, Poe, Kierkegaard=
, Yasusada and a=0Amyriad 18th century writers have all investigated in a m=
ultitude of ways.=0A=0AOne of the great effects of fictions is how they adv=
ise one of the realities=0Aof the fictional becoming realities which have v=
ast consequences in the=0A"real worlds" of history and economics, ideologie=
s and religion, poetics and=0Apropaganda.=0A=0AThis is why I felt on first =
reading Bolano  three years ago that his Chilean=0Aworld post 9/11/1973 is =
very instructive and illuminating in the USA's post=0A9/11/2001 versions of=
 fascism and Naomi Klein's "disaster capitalism" using=0AMilton Friedman's =
"Shock Doctrine" which, first applied Pinochet's Chile, is=0Anow being used=
 in the USA on itself.=0A=0AOne of the difficulties with the critique of th=
e self and the author is that=0Aboth author and self can easily be invented=
, and not once, but many times,=0Aas "real"  historical authors for centuri=
es  and  the fictional ones in=0ABolano's work, demonstrate.  The heyday fo=
r this method of earning a living=0Aas a writer was the 18th century, in wh=
ich authors like "Daniel Defoe" were=0Aknown by a multitude of names, all t=
hought to be different persons, whose=0Aworks when totaled up as the  "auth=
or" now known as Defoe number over two=0Ahundred.=0A=0A(One of the heterony=
ms of  Tagle-Ruis aka Carlos Weider in Bolano's Distant=0AStar, who is the =
novella's version of Lieutenant Ramirez Hoffman in  the=0ANazi Literatures =
book is Jules Defoe.)=0A=0AA few days ago I sent a letter in which thinking=
 of "reading carefully" or=0A"attentively" I used the term "close reading,"=
 in regards to language poetry=0A(though I think Marjorie Perloff does do t=
his), and Barry Schwabsky,=0Aassociating the term with Cleanth Brook's form=
 of New Criticism, quite=0Arightly wrote back that that form of reading isn=
't the kind that is=0Aunderstood to be applied to reading language writing.=
  I've never read=0ABrooks but recognize the form of reading Barry is think=
ing of, which isn't=0Awhat I meant, as I don't know how do that kind of Clo=
se reading. I thank him=0Afor the correction. Though  I have wondered often=
  if one may actually use=0Aany form of reading one wants to, if the "reade=
r is the producer of their=0Aown meanings" of the texts produced by a numbe=
r of the language and language=0Ainfluenced  authors who assert this.=0A=0A=
Barry wrote:=0A=0AThis (Close reading) is not the best way to appreciate la=
nguage poetry,=0Awhich opens up much more under a more free-floating field =
of attention. This=0Ais something that I remember Ron Silliman writing abou=
t somewhere, though=0Asomeone else will have to supply a specific reference=
.=0A=0AI had to laugh affectionately with this, as, if one looks at it--the=
=0A"free-floating attention" followed by "something that I remember Ron=0AS=
illiman writing somewhere," which "someone else will have to supply" the=0A=
reference for, doesn't seem to argue well for "free-floating attention" as =
a=0Amethod that will "stand up in court." (A standard good to bear in mind =
in=0Aregards to various aspects of textuality, for sure!)=0A=0A(When I firs=
t was reading language poetry and showed it to my wife, she=0Asaid--"Oh--yu=
ppies with degrees on pot," to describe the effect of the=0Awriting, which =
goes well with the "free floating attention" aspect, to be=0Ahumorous about=
 it.)=0A=0AI thought about this "free-floating form of attention" a lot the=
 last few=0Adays as I had usually associated it with "creative misreading,"=
  as wel as=0Amuch more profound examinations of it in Bachelard's writings=
.  Creative=0Amisreading in itself is a great tool to use for the dislocati=
ons of authors=0Aand texts and extending these into new realms of authorshi=
p, textuality and=0Areading.  I've tried keeping notebooks of al the words,=
 titles and names=0AI've misread during the course of the day, which often =
produce names, titles=0Aand ideas far more intriguingly attractive and chao=
tic than what usually=0Aturns out to be the rather prosaic words of origin.=
 Usually, though I start=0Alaughing too hard and forget to write the titles=
 of these "unknown=0Amasterpieces" down.=0A=0AI think a form of "creative m=
isreading" carried into the "critical realm"=0Aoccurred here recently, with=
 some interesting effects, which carry the=0Amisreading into other areas of=
 fictionality.=0A=0AThe discussion here provoked by the NY Times book revie=
w of Roberto Bolano's=0ANazi Literatures of the Americas,  provided several=
 examples of the ways in=0Awhich misreadings/readings of a few words can in=
spire the passionate=0Acreation of new authors and areas of literature whic=
h had not existed until=0Athe writer of a piece came along.  For example, t=
wo list writers read into=0Athe review that its author is anti-Semitic and =
 one of these list members,=0Ajudging from the  review's description of a c=
ouple writers from Bolano's=0Abook,  lept to the assumption that many of th=
em must be "New Formalists."=0A=0AThe reviewer is actually a Gay writer and=
 the winner of a Lambda Award.  She=0Ahas had quite  a distinguished profes=
sional career working  for a number of=0Apublishers and journals including =
the Voice Literary Supplement, as well as=0Ateaching and participating in w=
riters colonies.  Granted, the literary=0Asphere she inhabits may not be th=
e same that writers here  are interested in=0Aor sympathetic with, yet  I t=
hink without reading more of her works=0Afictional as well as non-fiction, =
it seems rather presumptuous to smear her,=0Aas well as idle speculation to=
 determine without reading it what a book's=0Awriters actually are.=0AOn th=
e other hand, these posts did something which is related with actual=0Aeven=
ts in literature concerning real persons, as well as the fictional=0Abeings=
 who inhabit Bolano's imagination.=0AThat is, they created a fictional bein=
g out of an actual one, a new=0A"anti-Semitic" writer publishing in of all =
places, the New York Times,a feat=0Awhich is almost impossible to conceive.=
 And as well, there was created for=0ABolano's legacy the post-humous addit=
ion to his compendium  that of the=0Agroup of American New Formalist writer=
s, though they  would not qualify for=0Aentry in the "real sense" of the bo=
ok.=0A=0AThese spontaneous creations are part and parcel of Bolano's vision=
 of=0Aliterature at one point, that it "is a surreptitious form of violence=
, a=0Apassport to respectability, and can, in certain young and sensitive n=
ations,=0Adisguise the social climber's origins."=0A=0A    Yet there seem t=
o be other and stranger motives behind some of the=0Aviolences done by auth=
ors to themselves and to others, ones which perhaps=0Aand at times directly=
  have to do as much as with their readers as the=0Aauthors themselves.=0A=
=0AThe best selling Holocaust memoir, translated into 18 languages and made=
 in=0Ato a French film--now turns out to be a fantasy created by a woman wh=
o turns=0Aout not to be Jewish. Yet obviously she has a great sympathy for =
the cause=0Awhich she has come to embody until now.  And obviously her read=
ers, already=0Aimmensely invested in the realities which her fantasy is tak=
ing part in,=0Awarmly welcomed her.=0A=0AIt's not quite as bizarre as the T=
he Education of Little Tree  the huge=0Abestseller taught across the US in =
schools  and a work beloved by the=0AEnvironmental Movement. Forrest Carter=
, the book's "American Indian" author,=0Aturned out to be Asa Carter, forme=
r speech writer for the Segregationist=0AGovernor George Wallace and had be=
en a member of some White Suprematist=0Agroups.=0A=0AA huge number of fake =
Indians have produced their versions of New Age=0APan-Indianism=0Awith quit=
e a lot of success.=0A=0AThe not-so-successful writer of gay and pornograph=
ic literature Timothy=0ABurrus became a best selling New Agey "Navajo" know=
n to the world as=0ANasdijj. His rise to fame began in 1999 when a story of=
 his in Esquire won a=0ATimothy Dwight Award.  As (real Indian) Sherman Ale=
xie writes in  "When the=0AStory Stolen Is Your Own," Nasdijj's prize winni=
ng story is basically a=0Athinly disguised copy of a story by Alexie which =
had also appeared in=0AEsquire, in 1993, and had launched Alexie's own care=
er.=0A=0A"Nasdijj" then is someone who is not only stealing a story, but in=
 effect,=0A"walking in Alexie's shoes" in order to find, like Alexie, a hug=
e readership=0Aand success.=0A=0A=0A      Despite the exposures of these an=
d many other fakes, the Fake Indian=0ABusiness continues to be a billion do=
llar a year one for non-Indians who=0Asell "Indian Crafts" and "Indian art =
work," and become "Native-American"=0Aexperts and teachers who exploit the =
fake ethnicity for gain and=0Aadvancement. Of course, for decades Indians c=
ould find the bones of their=0Aactual grandparents on exhibit in museums th=
roughout the USA.  An Indian=0Awriter has written a piece on the Museum of =
the American Indian in=0AWashington D.C. as "A Monument to Amnesia" a brill=
iant title which explains=0Aa great deal of monuments and the histories the=
y "stand for."=0A=0AA Palestinain writer suggested a couple years ago that =
this will be the=0Afuture of Palestinians--an almost entirely vanished peop=
le whose "arts and=0Acrafts," "songs and dances," poetry, cuisine, music an=
d traditions will be=0Aadopted and exploited in all manner of ways by anthr=
opolgists, hucksters,=0Aand all sorts of bizarre fantasizers of the very pe=
ople who exterminated=0Athem, just as it is in the USA.=0A=0AThen there is =
the interesting career of another writer, the terrorist and=0Alater Prime M=
inister of Israel, Menachim Begin.  His Revolt:  Story of the=0AIrgun (US e=
dition 1951) was widely used as a handbook by Al Queda in its=0Atraining ca=
mps in the earlier period of its development.  It's considered=0Aone of the=
 founding works of modern terrorrism, as its based on direct=0Aexperience a=
nd the development of many ideas  n great use today.=0A=0A    Interestingly=
, Begin's Revisionist Zionists were attracted to Fascism=0A(for its anti-Co=
mmunist, anti-Socialist attitudes and policies) in the=0A1930's, until the =
anti-Semitism of Hitler's regime had begun to become more=0Awidely known of=
.=0A=0AThe Irgun and Stern gang were also the introducers of the car bomb t=
o the=0AMiddle East, which was famously used in the USA in the 1920's from =
Wall=0AStreet to Milwaukee by primarily Anarchists.  When Anarchism was bru=
tally=0Aand effectively stamped into near non-existence by the Palmer Raids=
 and=0Afledging FBI--car bombing passed to the gangsters of Chicago to keep=
 it for=0Aa while alive in the USA=0A=0A  The example of the Irgun and Ster=
n's successful uses of the car bomb=0Aintroduced to others in the Middle Ea=
st has traveled world wide including=0Aback to the USA in Oklahoma City, so=
 that today it has become as its=0Ahistorian  Mike Davis calls it, "the poo=
r man's air force."=0A=0ANone of the writers in Bolano's Nazi Literatures o=
f the Americas is any kind=0Aof success on the scale of these authors.  Ins=
tead what Bolano does is chart=0Athe careers and strange lives of a heterog=
eneous assortment of bizarre and=0Asometimes entertaining figures, whose li=
ves are marked by an attraction to=0Athe creation of texts, in forms rangin=
g from mimeographed Soccer Fanzines to=0Aexpensive limited editions by Vani=
ty publishers, with introductions by=0Alovers or friends of the author poss=
essed by delusions of literary=0Agrandeur.  These writers work in a wide va=
riety of genre, as well as=0Acreating a multitude of hybrid genres and in o=
ne case, that of an American=0Awriter whose father was a friend of Charles =
Olson, attempting to write out=0Ahis demented conceptions of Projective and=
 Non-Projective verse, which he=0Ahimself has not really studied but absorb=
ed via process of distorted osmosis=0Aby being the son of his father, frien=
d of Olson.=0A=0AIn Distant Star and By Night in Chile, as well as The Sava=
ge Detectives,=0AAmulet and several short stories, Bolano also uses his fic=
tional poets,=0Acritics, editors and independent workshop teachers as comme=
ntators on the=0Aactual historical literary scenes of Latin and Central Ame=
rica. The bizarre=0Aeffects of a real Olson on a fictional character can be=
 turned around to=0Abecome, in terms of method,  the creation of literary c=
riticism via the=0Afictional, which, in becoming someday a real "Bolanian m=
ethod of criticism"=0Abe used in turn on the fictions of others.=0A=0AIn an=
d out of the stories flow a phantasmagoria of invented characters,=0Awhose =
brief biographies are given among the book's appendices, along with a=0Abib=
liography for each author with a chapter in the book, and a heady and=0Acra=
zy description of the bizarre and variously funded and appearing journals=
=0Ato which they have contributed.=0A=0AThe strange thing is, that Bolano's=
 inventions--inspired by those of Borges'=0Astories and his Book of Imagina=
ry Beings--are not that different from the=0Avery same kinds of lists and d=
escriptions of obscure writers and=0Apublications, little known precursors,=
 dandies and thugs, dope addicts and=0AOld Family heirs who inhabit that am=
azing collection assembled with genius=0Aand gusto by Ed Foster, Decadents,=
 Symbolists & Aesthetes in America=0AFin-de-Siecle American Poetry:  an Ant=
hology.  Foster's book, though a=0Anumber of the writers are still well or =
somewhat known today, captures also=0Athose long forgotten figures who play=
ed interesting and contributing roles=0Ain the literary circles of their da=
y, and whose lives and works are jammed=0Awith a fervor and passion for lit=
erature and the arts and travel the equal=0Aof many far more famous writers=
 and bohemians, editors and poets, muckrakers=0Aand translators of scandalo=

It's rare that I cheer when anyone, whether a public or a private person, dies.  But I did so when Buckley died the other day.  Anyone who ever saw his horrendous interview with Jack Kerouac at the end of that writer's life knew that Buckley was totally inhuman.  So he joins Reagan and Nixon among my hierarchy of people whose death gives us joy.  Not very Buddhist, I suppose.   But no one is perfect.  That Buckley was a spoiled, over-protected intellectual ogre whose influence was almost totally negative doesn't make him Satan.  I doubt the devil would have learned how to play the harpsichord, the only good thing Buckley did in his life of which I am aware.  Regards, Tom Savage

I was surprised, btw, that you did not mention the story in today's times a=
bout yet another literary hoax--headline, "Gang Memoir, Turning Page, is Pu=
re Fiction": http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/books/04fake.html?th&emc=3Dt=
h=0A=0AThe article begins:=0A=0AIn =E2=80=9CLove and Consequences,=E2=80=9D=
 a critically acclaimed memoir published last week, Margaret B. Jones wrote=
 about her life as a half-white, half-Native American girl growing up in So=
uth-Central Los Angeles as a foster child among gang-bangers, running drugs=
 for the Bloods. =0AThe problem is that none of it is true.=0AMargaret B. J=
ones is a pseudonym for Margaret Seltzer, who is all white and grew up in t=
he well-to-do Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles, in the San Fernando Vall=
ey, with her biological family.=0A=0ALike you, David, I am fascinated by su=
ch cases, however, I can't take a moralistic stance toward it. I'm sure it =

Freud said was the motive behind all art; and the same would have been the =

book "Mishcha's Memoire of the Holocaust years," a huge bestseller and=0Atr=
anslated into 18 languages and made into a French film, turns out to be=0Af=
antasy which the "author" has been living out in fact her actual daily=0Are=
ality.=0A=0AThe realities which fiction creates and then are exposed as fic=
tions become=0Ain turn "new realities."  This latest revelation of how both=
 an author and=0Aa huge number of people across many languages and suppleme=
nted by the=0Acinema, may all be participating in a fantasy which in itself=
 answers a real=0Adeeply felt need and desire is the latest major  example =
of an "Author" who=0Ain her own actual life lives her fantasy and becomes a=
 leading=0A"spokesperson" for millions.=0A=0AKeeping track of the number of=
 invented authors and lives who are=0Acontinually turning up as well as the=
 creators of "vribant new works"  and=0Anationally respected historians" an=
d scholars who make use of a patchwork=0Aquilt of plagiarisms, is a form of=
 literary studies in its own right, one=0Awhich Bolano, Borges, Nabokov, Pe=
ssoa, Poe, Kierkegaard, Yasusada and a=0Amyriad 18th century writers have a=
ll investigated in a multitude of ways.=0A=0AOne of the great effects of fi=
ctions is how they advise one of the realities=0Aof the fictional becoming =
realities which have vast consequences in the=0A"real worlds" of history an=
d economics, ideologies and religion, poetics and=0Apropaganda.=0A=0AThis i=
s why I felt on first reading Bolano  three years ago that his Chilean=0Awo=
rld post 9/11/1973 is very instructive and illuminating in the USA's post=
=0A9/11/2001 versions of fascism and Naomi Klein's "disaster capitalism" us=
ing=0AMilton Friedman's "Shock Doctrine" which, first applied Pinochet's Ch=
ile, is=0Anow being used in the USA on itself.=0A=0AOne of the difficulties=
 with the critique of the self and the author is that=0Aboth author and sel=
f can easily be invented, and not once, but many times,=0Aas "real"  histor=
ical authors for centuries  and  the fictional ones in=0ABolano's work, dem=
onstrate.  The heyday for this method of earning a living=0Aas a writer was=
 the 18th century, in which authors like "Daniel Defoe" were=0Aknown by a m=
ultitude of names, all thought to be different persons, whose=0Aworks when =
totaled up as the  "author" now known as Defoe number over two=0Ahundred.=
=0A=0A(One of the heteronyms of  Tagle-Ruis aka Carlos Weider in Bolano's D=
istant=0AStar, who is the novella's version of Lieutenant Ramirez Hoffman i=
n  the=0ANazi Literatures book is Jules Defoe.)=0A=0AA few days ago I sent =
a letter in which thinking of "reading carefully" or=0A"attentively" I used=
 the term "close reading," in regards to language poetry=0A(though I think =
Marjorie Perloff does do this), and Barry Schwabsky,=0Aassociating the term=
 with Cleanth Brook's form of New Criticism, quite=0Arightly wrote back tha=
t that form of reading isn't the kind that is=0Aunderstood to be applied to=
 reading language writing.  I've never read=0ABrooks but recognize the form=
 of reading Barry is thinking of, which isn't=0Awhat I meant, as I don't kn=
ow how do that kind of Close reading. I thank him=0Afor the correction. Tho=
ugh  I have wondered often  if one may actually use=0Aany form of reading o=
ne wants to, if the "reader is the producer of their=0Aown meanings" of the=
 texts produced by a number of the language and language=0Ainfluenced  auth=
ors who assert this.=0A=0ABarry wrote:=0A=0AThis (Close reading) is not the=
 best way to appreciate language poetry,=0Awhich opens up much more under a=
 more free-floating field of attention. This=0Ais something that I remember=
 Ron Silliman writing about somewhere, though=0Asomeone else will have to s=
upply a specific reference.=0A=0AI had to laugh affectionately with this, a=
s, if one looks at it--the=0A"free-floating attention" followed by "somethi=
ng that I remember Ron=0ASilliman writing somewhere," which "someone else w=
ill have to supply" the=0Areference for, doesn't seem to argue well for "fr=
ee-floating attention" as a=0Amethod that will "stand up in court." (A stan=
dard good to bear in mind in=0Aregards to various aspects of textuality, fo=
r sure!)=0A=0A(When I first was reading language poetry and showed it to my=
 wife, she=0Asaid--"Oh--yuppies with degrees on pot," to describe the effec=
t of the=0Awriting, which goes well with the "free floating attention" aspe=
ct, to be=0Ahumorous about it.)=0A=0AI thought about this "free-floating fo=
rm of attention" a lot the last few=0Adays as I had usually associated it w=
ith "creative misreading,"  as wel as=0Amuch more profound examinations of =
it in Bachelard's writings.  Creative=0Amisreading in itself is a great too=
l to use for the dislocations of authors=0Aand texts and extending these in=
to new realms of authorship, textuality and=0Areading.  I've tried keeping =
notebooks of al the words, titles and names=0AI've misread during the cours=
e of the day, which often produce names, titles=0Aand ideas far more intrig=
uingly attractive and chaotic than what usually=0Aturns out to be the rathe=
r prosaic words of origin. Usually, though I start=0Alaughing too hard and =
forget to write the titles of these "unknown=0Amasterpieces" down.=0A=0AI t=
hink a form of "creative misreading" carried into the "critical realm"=0Aoc=
curred here recently, with some interesting effects, which carry the=0Amisr=
eading into other areas of fictionality.=0A=0AThe discussion here provoked =
by the NY Times book review of Roberto Bolano's=0ANazi Literatures of the A=
mericas,  provided several examples of the ways in=0Awhich misreadings/read=
ings of a few words can inspire the passionate=0Acreation of new authors an=
d areas of literature which had not existed until=0Athe writer of a piece c=
ame along.  For example, two list writers read into=0Athe review that its a=
uthor is anti-Semitic and  one of these list members,=0Ajudging from the  r=
eview's description of a couple writers from Bolano's=0Abook,  lept to the =
assumption that many of them must be "New Formalists."=0A=0AThe reviewer is=
 actually a Gay writer and the winner of a Lambda Award.  She=0Ahas had qui=
te  a distinguished professional career working  for a number of=0Apublishe=
rs and journals including the Voice Literary Supplement, as well as=0Ateach=
ing and participating in writers colonies.  Granted, the literary=0Asphere =
she inhabits may not be the same that writers here  are interested in=0Aor =
sympathetic with, yet  I think without reading more of her works=0Afictiona=
l as well as non-fiction, it seems rather presumptuous to smear her,=0Aas w=
ell as idle speculation to determine without reading it what a book's=0Awri=
ters actually are.=0AOn the other hand, these posts did something which is =
related with actual=0Aevents in literature concerning real persons, as well=
 as the fictional=0Abeings who inhabit Bolano's imagination.=0AThat is, the=
y created a fictional being out of an actual one, a new=0A"anti-Semitic" wr=
iter publishing in of all places, the New York Times,a feat=0Awhich is almo=
st impossible to conceive. And as well, there was created for=0ABolano's le=
gacy the post-humous addition to his compendium  that of the=0Agroup of Ame=
rican New Formalist writers, though they  would not qualify for=0Aentry in =
the "real sense" of the book.=0A=0AThese spontaneous creations are part and=
 parcel of Bolano's vision of=0Aliterature at one point, that it "is a surr=
eptitious form of violence, a=0Apassport to respectability, and can, in cer=
tain young and sensitive nations,=0Adisguise the social climber's origins."=
=0A=0A    Yet there seem to be other and stranger motives behind some of th=
e=0Aviolences done by authors to themselves and to others, ones which perha=
ps=0Aand at times directly  have to do as much as with their readers as the=
=0Aauthors themselves.=0A=0AThe best selling Holocaust memoir, translated i=
nto 18 languages and made in=0Ato a French film--now turns out to be a fant=
asy created by a woman who turns=0Aout not to be Jewish. Yet obviously she =
has a great sympathy for the cause=0Awhich she has come to embody until now=
..  And obviously her readers, already=0Aimmensely invested in the realities=
 which her fantasy is taking part in,=0Awarmly welcomed her.=0A=0AIt's not =
quite as bizarre as the The Education of Little Tree  the huge=0Abestseller=
 taught across the US in schools  and a work beloved by the=0AEnvironmental=
 Movement. Forrest Carter, the book's "American Indian" author,=0Aturned ou=
t to be Asa Carter, former speech writer for the Segregationist=0AGovernor =
George Wallace and had been a member of some White Suprematist=0Agroups.=0A=
=0AA huge number of fake Indians have produced their versions of New Age=0A=
Pan-Indianism=0Awith quite a lot of success.=0A=0AThe not-so-successful wri=
ter of gay and pornographic literature Timothy=0ABurrus became a best selli=
ng New Agey "Navajo" known to the world as=0ANasdijj. His rise to fame bega=
n in 1999 when a story of his in Esquire won a=0ATimothy Dwight Award.  As =
(real Indian) Sherman Alexie writes in  "When the=0AStory Stolen Is Your Ow=
n," Nasdijj's prize winning story is basically a=0Athinly disguised copy of=
 a story by Alexie which had also appeared in=0AEsquire, in 1993, and had l=
aunched Alexie's own career.=0A=0A"Nasdijj" then is someone who is not only=
 stealing a story, but in effect,=0A"walking in Alexie's shoes" in order to=
 find, like Alexie, a huge readership=0Aand success.=0A=0A=0A      Despite =
the exposures of these and many other fakes, the Fake Indian=0ABusiness con=
tinues to be a billion dollar a year one for non-Indians who=0Asell "Indian=
 Crafts" and "Indian art work," and become "Native-American"=0Aexperts and =
teachers who exploit the fake ethnicity for gain and=0Aadvancement. Of cour=
se, for decades Indians could find the bones of their=0Aactual grandparents=
 on exhibit in museums throughout the USA.  An Indian=0Awriter has written =
a piece on the Museum of the American Indian in=0AWashington D.C. as "A Mon=
ument to Amnesia" a brilliant title which explains=0Aa great deal of monume=
nts and the histories they "stand for."=0A=0AA Palestinain writer suggested=
 a couple years ago that this will be the=0Afuture of Palestinians--an almo=
st entirely vanished people whose "arts and=0Acrafts," "songs and dances," =
poetry, cuisine, music and traditions will be=0Aadopted and exploited in al=
l manner of ways by anthropolgists, hucksters,=0Aand all sorts of bizarre f=
antasizers of the very people who exterminated=0Athem, just as it is in the=
 USA.=0A=0AThen there is the interesting career of another writer, the terr=
orist and=0Alater Prime Minister of Israel, Menachim Begin.  His Revolt:  S=
tory of the=0AIrgun (US edition 1951) was widely used as a handbook by Al Q=
ueda in its=0Atraining camps in the earlier period of its development.  It'=
s considered=0Aone of the founding works of modern terrorrism, as its based=
 on direct=0Aexperience and the development of many ideas  n great use toda=
y.=0A=0A    Interestingly, Begin's Revisionist Zionists were attracted to F=
ascism=0A(for its anti-Communist, anti-Socialist attitudes and policies) in=
 the=0A1930's, until the anti-Semitism of Hitler's regime had begun to beco=
me more=0Awidely known of.=0A=0AThe Irgun and Stern gang were also the intr=
oducers of the car bomb to the=0AMiddle East, which was famously used in th=
e USA in the 1920's from Wall=0AStreet to Milwaukee by primarily Anarchists=
..  When Anarchism was brutally=0Aand effectively stamped into near non-exis=
tence by the Palmer Raids and=0Afledging FBI--car bombing passed to the gan=
gsters of Chicago to keep it for=0Aa while alive in the USA=0A=0A  The exam=
ple of the Irgun and Stern's successful uses of the car bomb=0Aintroduced t=
o others in the Middle East has traveled world wide including=0Aback to the=
 USA in Oklahoma City, so that today it has become as its=0Ahistorian  Mike=
 Davis calls it, "the poor man's air force."=0A=0ANone of the writers in Bo=
lano's Nazi Literatures of the Americas is any kind=0Aof success on the sca=
le of these authors.  Instead what Bolano does is chart=0Athe careers and s=
trange lives of a heterogeneous assortment of bizarre and=0Asometimes enter=
taining figures, whose lives are marked by an attraction to=0Athe creation =
of texts, in forms ranging from mimeographed Soccer Fanzines to=0Aexpensive=
 limited editions by Vanity publishers, with introductions by=0Alovers or f=
riends of the author possessed by delusions of literary=0Agrandeur.  These =
writers work in a wide variety of genre, as well as=0Acreating a multitude =
of hybrid genres and in one case, that of an American=0Awriter whose father=
 was a friend of Charles Olson, attempting to write out=0Ahis demented conc=
eptions of Projective and Non-Projective verse, which he=0Ahimself has not =
really studied but absorbed via process of distorted osmosis=0Aby being the=
 son of his father, friend of Olson.=0A=0AIn Distant Star and By Night in C=
hile, as well as The Savage Detectives,=0AAmulet and several short stories,=
 Bolano also uses his fictional poets,=0Acritics, editors and independent w=
orkshop teachers as commentators on the=0Aactual historical literary scenes=
 of Latin and Central America. The bizarre=0Aeffects of a real Olson on a f=
ictional character can be turned around to=0Abecome, in terms of method,  t=
he creation of literary criticism via the=0Afictional, which, in becoming s=
omeday a real "Bolanian method of criticism"=0Abe used in turn on the ficti=
ons of others.=0A=0AIn and out of the stories flow a phantasmagoria of inve=
nted characters,=0Awhose brief biographies are given among the book's appen=
dices, along with a=0Abibliography for each author with a chapter in the bo=
ok, and a heady and=0Acrazy description of the bizarre and variously funded=
 and appearing journals=0Ato which they have contributed.=0A=0AThe strange =
thing is, that Bolano's inventions--inspired by those of Borges'=0Astories =
and his Book of Imaginary Beings--are not that different from the=0Avery sa=
me kinds of lists and descriptions of obscure writers and=0Apublications, l=
ittle known precursors, dandies and thugs, dope addicts and=0AOld Family he=
irs who inhabit that amazing collection assembled with genius=0Aand gusto b=
y Ed Foster, Decadents, Symbolists & Aesthetes in America=0AFin-de-Siecle A=
merican Poetry:  an Anthology.  Foster's book, though a=0Anumber of the wri=
ters are still well or somewhat known today, captures also=0Athose long for=
gotten figures who played interesting and contributing roles=0Ain the liter=
ary circles of their day, and whose lives and works are jammed=0Awith a fer=
vor and passion for literature and the arts and travel the equal=0Aof many =
far more famous writers and bohemians, editors and poets, muckrakers=0Aand =
translators of scandalous works.=0A      Reading this along side the Bolano=
 is a doubled enjoyment, as one=0Acareens among the "real" and the fictiona=
l writers, with their publications,=0Acoteries, rivalries, friendships and =
causes.

Dear Barry:

My deepest apologies--
i had hoped i conveyed i am laughing affectionately--
and i note in my letter i do creative misreadings many times a day--
and periodically try to keep a notebook of them--

my reading here is a creative one, i am not laughing AT you nor at language
poetry

i am just laughing at the ways words have lives of their own--
completely independent often of anyone--
and makes a good deal of the love of words--
be for just this independence--

i indicated my immediate associated image is with being in court
and trying to convince the judge of some point while essaying this
methodology as why i have misunderstood what i am in fact charged with

all my life i have had to "prove" my "identity" and endless problems in many
countries including often here in the USA--grew out of not being believed
even with the right documents
so one is arrested for being "someone else"--
and, having the "fake" papers of course assumed to be someone "dangerous"
which makes the trouble much much worse--

because one is not one self, but "someone else"--

when i wrote for the Boston Phoenix after a while the editors told me they
used to check al the names i would cite and the ideas, and allusions--

because they hadn't heard of them, and thought maybe i was making it all
up--

i am not a scholar either--
my life experience and many writers that i like are ones that make one very
aware of "examples," "proofs," "evidences" and the like--
because of the forms of comedy and tragedy involved in these--
as well as life and death very much--
can hang by the thread of some detail--

being shoved in political jails for being someone one has never heard of
because the papers one has can't possibly be one's own-
or writing of actual things and having been doubted as creating fictions--

is always a good way to be reminded regarding the reasons and explanations
given for things--
as often they may include many contradictions--
which it is understood one is to "take for granted"--
rather than to be wondered about--

and so there is often something humorous to be found in the most serious
things
and serious things to be found in the humorous--

i've been reading over and over again in the last months one of the greatest
books i have ever come across re reading/writing--
Leonardo Sciascia's The Moro Affair--it has increased even more my thinking
on words in relations with contexts in which the "symptoms in the language"
are what the reader/writer has to go on  in examining a society via its
documents, and how documents may be indicating from within them something
which they have trained themselves previously to hide--

and that by essaying to use the language of concealment now to essay a
revealing--the powers that be can say--the writer has changed--it is no
longer he--and attribute this to various causes which they "assume to be
self evident"--
and which are not at all true, yet, being turned into the "general opinion"
are used as a method for effectively blocking that which is essaying to be
recognized fro within--

when i was a kid in some religious instruction Sunday School class this
obsessiveness with forms of rationale and assumption and "what is natural"
and what is constructed,  what is hidden, what is concealed, what is a
secret code and what is a decoy code--al these things fascinated me and
still do---
and to be sure  this always got me in trouble
one time  for example--i was asked to explain why in the "the Beginning was
the Word"--
and what that meant
i said it was because of course since we learned this from a book and books
are by writers, they would be the first to have people believe that the
word, their trade in hand, was at the beginning, and so the most important
thing--

but why believe someone who in a book tells you that words are the beginning
other than that it must be to further make one believe in the book--
which in turn is dependent on the word--
because it is the book which has "planted" as it were the word to be there
at the start--
to be "found" later in the book--
as "at the beginning"--
which means to say of course--
how important and amazing and truly strange that writing can be!!!!
to have undertaken and dared this fantastic manoeuvre--and pulled it off!

in broad daylight so to speak!!
"Let there be Light!!" indeed--!

i hope you understand that i am truly not laughing at you at all nor at
language poetry--

i am just laughing with the lifelong delight in the ways in which writing
exists in the world
which is to say that writing and poems and books--
all also have lives of their own also
quite often independent of writers and poets
and perform all sorts of stunts
completely unexpectedly--
-
and so many times a day that one is truly deeply thankful--

with all my friendship and respect--

What about Vidal punching Buckley. An urban legend, I think. Vidal did call Buckley a cyrpto facist, but he did so during a heated argument. No, Bukley was never any sort of Nazi although I'm sure you were deliberatley glib in calling him one. His son is an entertaining noveliest. Sad, but the right has a claim to owning the small niche known as comic writing.

CA Conrad <caconrad13@GMAIL.COM> wrote:  One of the most interesting interviews I've ever seen in my life is William
F. Buckley interviewing Gloria Steinem for TV. You might be able to find it
online. It's about twenty years old is my guess. My local library here in
Philadelphia has it on video cassette and I HAD TO SEE IT, of course! I
remember thinking when first seeing it on the shelf, "REALLY!?! HOW WEIRD!"

And weird it was! I wound up watching it about 20 times, FASCINATED by
these two very different iconic forces sitting there together. What was
obvious, IN FACT VERY OBVIOUS, was that Buckley really didn't know who the
hell he was interviewing. He had a lot of information like a lot of people
do about Gloria Steinem that was mostly based on IDEAS about who she is, and
WHY she "is the way she is," and it's all mostly wrong. For instance he
asks in this flippant kind of tone about her father, wanting to know what
her relationship with her father was like, DO YOU LOVE YOU FATHER OR WHAT?,
kind of thing, the tone leading the listeners for a response that would
indicate maybe she's a man hater AND HERE'S THE REASON WHY. But Gloria
Steinem in her clear, honest, ZEN style didn't flinch, DID NOT FLINCH at his
tone and launched into a beautiful story about her father, and who he was,
and how important he was to her.

Buckley of course was not just conservative about gender, but very much so
about class. It was interesting hearing Steinem, and watching Buckley as
she talked about class. At one point she told this marvelous story about
going to her high school reunion in Toledo and her college reunion at Smith
in the same year. She said that the contrast taught her so much about the
strength of her working class roots that she had wanted to always remember.
She said that her old friends in Toledo understood feminist practice and
life practice better than her friends with degrees in Women's Studies
because THEY KNEW the difficulties and unfairness of having to work full
time, THEN also take care of kids, cook dinner, do laundry, etc. It was a
nice moment, and made me think of friends I have in Philadelphia who work
with The Global Women's Strike who ACTUALLY work every single day helping
women get medical care for themselves and their children, and work at
fighting with them in Family Court over DHS bullshit, and set up groups to
help care for prostitutes with AIDS and so much more. Almost ALL of the
women at The Global Women's Strike are working class, or from working class
backgrounds.

Another BRILLIANT moment in the interview is when Buckley was CLEARLY
irritated by the fact that when Steinem turned 40 she made a very public
announcement about it. She answered yet again with that disarming, calm
tone, "Well, women have been hiding their age for years and I wanted
everyone to see what a woman looks like when she turns 40." It's a
marvelous interview from start to finish! What's especially good is that an
angry, nasty conservative like Buckley asks the right kinds of questions for
his crowd who think they have all of these things figured out. And it's
PERFECT that it's Gloria Steinem because she's such a tower of focus that
cannot be toppled.

Gloria Steinem's calm and intelligent interview style reminds me of another
hero of mine Faye Wattleton, former head of Planned Parenthood. I've seen
Wattleton in several interviews about abortion where she has had to deal
with some seriously ANGRY pro-life people and she ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS winds
up saying things that throw them completely off track. Like, "So are you
going to take care of these children yourself? Do you have a very roomy
house, I hope so because you're going to need a lot of room." Very calm,
smart, full of statistics, she's a genius. In fact here is a direct
Wattleton quote, "Whoever is providing leadership needs to be as fresh and
thoughtful and reflective as possible to make the very best fight."

they sit in prison, no matter how long this country takes to right itself,
their families will have a roof over their heads, food in their stomachs,

This stuff just baffles me. Of course, it gives the lie of the 'memoir'
genre which is little more than sensationalism and voyeuristic
pornography these days, but if the book's good the book's good. who
cares if it's fiction or not? it strikes me that the problem here isn't
people writing fiction and selling it as non-fiction, it's that people
can only seem to invest in a book if they're assured by the publisher
that the stories contained within are about real people and are not made
up. that these selfsame people  then have the audacity to get peevish
about it when writers pull the wool over their eyes in order to get them
to pay attention to what they're saying is really just idiotic.

earlier i sent a link to http://youtube.com/watch?v=o4Gbphh4U1Y which is
Shine Over Babylon by Sheryl Crow.

i've watched this several times now.

some comments.

sheryl crow is an amazing singer. not only in how she hits the often rather
high notes pretty much always (no high ones in 'shine over babylon'--i mean
other songs), but in the percussive quality of her timing; her voice is not
solely melodic; it's also percussive. try singing along using the lyrics at
http://sherylcrow.com/lyrics/default.aspx/pid/439/tid/5514 and you'll see
what i mean.

also, she has picked up in this song something new to her repertoire: a kind
of dylanesque delivery in this song of protest. it's dylanesque, isn't it?
perhaps a kind of cross between dylan and the strong individual word
emphasis in much rap. each word is enunciated with some force which is both
rhetorical and rhythmic. it conveys conviction in what is being said, and
outrage. sometimes this is quite beautiful and memorable:

Freedones etched on Sacred pillars
Hollow stones of mindless filler
Can lead to madman oil drillers
Won't be long before we all are killers

that last line has real force in the song. not so much in reading it. so too
here:

I wait for shouts from crazy cranks
I stand amidst the brown shirt ranks

the force is not just a matter of the words themselves, but of how the last
lines of the above verses acquire part of their power in the climax of a
musical arrangement and strong vocalization.

sometimes the lyrics are erm somewhat blonde:

I walked the heat of seven hills
Endless talk of losing wills
Geat highways in a constant melt
Men and women and children all have overbuilt

"Men and women and children all have overbuilt"? Isn't that a bit daft? But
it sounds so good in the song! The rhythm of that line. The percussive
quality. The arpeggio of the first part of the line and the slowing down at
the end. One feels she settled for the musical quality in this line and
didn't mind too much that the line itself was weak in sense. I guess we see
in this line a mixture of strength and weakness: strong phrasing but weak
poetry. Anyway, she's an incredibly good singer. if you ever see her sing
with other notable singers, note that they're often rather nervous to be
singing with her. Like in the duet with Sarah McLaughlan in 'The Difficult
Kind' at http://sherylcrow.com/video .

Hey, in the backing vocals you first hear in the song--which are repeated
throughout the song--aren't those backing vocals played backwards??? Sounds
really great.

The text in this video is prominent and kind of interesting. The look of it
varies from newspaper columns to the dots of such text. The zoom into dots
is also zoom away from the text and concentration on Sheryl. The zoom into
the text is zoom into a parallelism between lyric and newspaper headline.

Sometimes this parallel is kind of funny. The verse I quoted of "Men and
women and children all have overbuilt" goes with newspaper headlines about
rising population and overcrowding. Yes, that line needed a bit of
explanatory text!

Also, the lyrics and the headlines carom from one fret to another, not
necessarily all that related except as a critique of life in the USA under
comrade W in an age that has big problems politicians hesitate to address,
such as global warming and the pressures of rising populations.

The look of the newspaper text, and its motion, is within a 3d space that
follows the lyrics and Sheryl walking. Quite web-3D in its look.

Anyway, I thought it was a pretty interesting video and the song itself,
despite the lyrics not being as strong as they could have been, in parts, is
I think quite a beautiful and uplifting song, surely one of Crow's best, and
that's saying a lot because she's the real thing as a singer-song writer and
has a dozen or more songs that will be heard for many years to come. Most of
the really good ones are not particularly 'political'; they're often
storyful, not ballads, but something out of contemporary short fiction.

The use of visual text in this video is at least as much about look as what
it says. It's well-done visually but not as well-done in the poetical
quality of its expression. Also, that parallelism with the lyrics is a bit
too subordinated to the lyrics to be art on its own. It comes across as
having been done by somebody doing a job for a paycheque rather than by an
artist with a mind of his/her own.

Still, it's interesting to see the influence of poetical visual work with
text in work like this.

It is curious how fraudulent, rather than merely pseudononymous or
created, authors desire an aura of authenticity yet seem oblivious to
the probability of ethical scrutiny and consequences -- not to mention
the real dangers from certain violent or criminal communities. Does
the value of the text trump authorship? If so, then post-structural
literary theory might become a scapegoat via association. Obviously
the philosopher is not responsible for misappropriation; but if as
David suggests, this is a new, or at least continuing area of study, I
welcome some references. I don't mean the author-as-dead but the
author-as-a-fraud. Perhaps literary genres should "die" along with
authors and readers :)

Pfft, this is yet another sadly persistent case of taking everything but the
burden <http://www.randomhouse.com/boldtype/0303/tate/>. I dont care what
her reasons are for writing the book, noone else but Seltzer and her
publisher were gonna profit from it.

Ditto, yer sentiments, Chip Duckett and CA Conrad, re: Lil Con Poseur
Buckley, most indescribably tedious and despicable boob of the "Rights"
since the dark ages now finally evaporated into all of history and
oblivion anybody wants to own, or forget.

=20

I used to refer to him as Bill "Fuck" Buckley, but I always had
reservations about that moniker because in fact I like the word Fuck and
have strong feelings about reserving it as a special and sacred word, so
associating it with Buckley seemed kind of sacrilegious, always, too.
Like using the expression "mother****er," which Mr. Silliman taught me
in _Tjanting_ 23 years ago sucked and should be replaced by
"other****er."

=20

Yeah, too bad a whole bunch of folks couldn't get together and write a
true history of Little Ole Pasty Face.  Maybe one that would somehow
show compassion for him in some way, but "compassion" that somehow
brought greater and more genuine attention to just how truly rotten and
absurd and unfeeling and annoying and wack and weird and messed-up and
destructive he was, how lacking he was in that department, Compassion,
how dangerous he was, how he was a true terrorist, actually.  Hmmm,
yeah, that would be a good project, an anthology of Buckley, "the REAL
Buckley," in all his inglorious unrealness.

=20

Anyways, ditto Chip Duckett and CA Conrad.  My sentiments, too.  Buckley
was a true scourge, a scumball, a creep, a "tragically" delusional
"soul."

=20

=20

=20

Steve Tills

P.S. Of course, it's six of one and half a dozen of the other whether
the most effective way of dissing a jerk like Buckley is to write his
"true history" or refuse to give him any more attention ("history") at
all.  Hmmm, that's an interesting question, to me.  What's best,
sometimes -- giving "this person or that event MORE ATTENTION" or
ignoring the given fool or the given acts of buffoonery altogether...

P.S. II Or should I use the term "cognomen," or perhaps "sobriquet," in
keeping with Buckley's eerie, obnoxious, notorious pretentiousness -
something he developed into an artwork of (the proverbial) monumental
proportions.  His entire Life's Work is nothing but the supreme American
commodification of pretentiousness, itself, is it not?

P.S. III  And another thing - how is it that an entire reputation,
"ouerve," or Life's Work can be built up, inflated into, made into a
commercially successful cultural object/commodity simply by virtue of
its being a moronic "contrast" to something else (Liberalism,
Progressivism, etc.) made of genuine standards, common sense,
intelligence, integrity, decency, wisdom, originality, virtue, and
authenticity?  How could "a William F. Buckley," or a William F.
Buckley's so-called "Work" and enterprise even exist if a culture
accepted or rejected things based on genuinely meaningful standards?
Isn't Buckley's entire Life Work nothing but a forerunner of "reality
TV" in the world of American intellectual production?  Is there anything
in or of Buckley's entire Life Work that is real or that stands up to
the rigors of true intellectual workmanship and integrity? =20

P.S. IV Incredibly amazing!  In America, morons can so easily turn
Harvard/Yale priviledged college "educations"/unionCARDS into
insufferably profitable careers simply by marketing their "products" and
Being as (psuedo) alternatives to what is good and just and wise and
worthwhile Substance...

 In the movement between departure and arrival, winter and spring, sleep an=

ty. The disorientation of such moments is ripe for poetic work. This worksh=

ty and help us explore the transitional phases in our lives. Appropriate fo=
r experienced writers and those just beginning.

Remember James Frey,  his dopey confession on Oprah? "A Million Little Pieces" would have been a decent first novel. The guy knew something about addiction, spun a reasonably compelling narrative, etc. But gosh, some of it was made up. Most of it was made up. What do people want -- True Confessions?

people writing fiction and selling it as non-fiction, it's that people

CUTTING THE EDGE. Alan Sondheim, Azure Carter, Sandy Baldwin and Gary
Manes have been working for the past several months at the Virtual
Environments Laboratory, West Virginia University, Morgantown. Sondheim
will be presenting the results of that research, which involves avatars,
human modeling, phenomenology of virtual lives, choreography, motion
capture, and a host of other issues. Some of the work has been completed
with renowned dancer/choreographer Foofwa d'Imobilite, based in New York
and Geneva, Switzerland. The modeling includes distorted and misconfigured
mappings, crystal and other radio mappings of the environment, and other
material which literally cut the edge, live on the edge of software,
hardware, and real-life environments, including Second Life, Brooklyn,
West Virginia, and spaces internal to 3D modeling programs. This work is
supported by National Science Foundation (WVU) and New York State Council
On The Arts grants. The prolific Alan Sondheim has been a regular part of
the Personal Cinema Series for many years and this program contains his
usual collection of surprises, sexual meditations and formal adventures.
He has been constructing audio and video, performing, and inscribing
within cyberspace since 1994. Since that time he has been working on an
"internet text," a continuous meditation on philosophy, psychology,
language, body and virtuality.

for those Obama fans feeling a little low after his tuesday "momentum-check"
here is some mild consolation. two poems (fished out from the net) Barack
wrote in his college days.

pretty decent poems for a 19-year-old, especially the second one.

 =========================================================================

Pop

Sitting in his seat, a seat broad and broken

In, sprinkled with ashes,

Pop switches channels, takes another

Shot of Seagrams, neat, and asks

What to do with me, a green young man

Who fails to consider the

Flim and flam of the world, since

Things have been easy for me;

I stare hard at his face, a stare

That deflects off his brow;

I'm sure he's unaware of his

Dark, watery eyes, that

Glance in different directions,

And his slow, unwelcome twitches,

Fail to pass.

I listen, nod,

Listen, open, till I cling to his pale,

Beige T-shirt, yelling,

Yelling in his ears, that hang

With heavy lobes, but he's still telling

His joke, so I ask why

He's so unhappy, to which he replies . . .

But I don't care anymore, cause

He took too damn long, and from

Under my seat, I pull out the

Mirror I've been saving; I'm laughing,

Laughing loud, the blood rushing from

his face

To mine, as he grows small,

A spot in my brain, something

That may be squeezed out, like a

Watermelon seed between

Two fingers.

Pop takes another shot, neat,

Points out the same amber

Stain on his shorts that I've got on mine,

and

Makes me smell his smell, coming

From me; he switches channels, recites

an old poem

He wrote before his mother died,

Stands, shouts, and asks

For a hug, as I shink*, my

Arms barely reaching around

His thick, oily neck, and his broad back;

'cause

I see my face, framed within

Pop's black-framed glasses

And know he's laughing too.

================================


Underground

Under water grottos, caverns

Filled with apes

That eat figs.

Stepping on the figs

That the apes

Eat, they crunch.

The apes howl, bare

Their fangs, dance,

Tumble in the

Rushing water,

Musty, wet pelts

Glistening in the blue.

I'm also thinking of the JT Leroy dust up here. And those weren't even memoirs, they were billed as novels. The only falseness there was the persona of the author, how the author chose to represent herself in public. The whole thing is ridiculous. I don't think people want True Confessions, I think they want the literary equivalent of Reality TV. I shudder for the future of our culture.

Chirot posted this a couple of weeks ago. It's a fun article. Bloom read the Obama poems. He thought they were decent. Bloom goes on to ridicule politicians and other public figures and their dismal verse. He calls Jimmy Carter "the worst poet in America." Poor Jimmy. And yet, he (Carter) remains distinguished, if only as very bad.

Subject: More re Literary frauds etc//Fallout from a Literary Fraud-NY Times
To: david.chirot@gmail.com


Mary asked if there is more re literary frauds--following these links i
write of a few that have existed since the Sumerians

Tragically in the deepest sense,  the site of the first writing as well as
the first forgeries of writing, is being annihilated by the American
Invasion and Occupation of Iraq, based on the use of forgeries--

Forgeries, frauds not only "fake" a reality and/or fiction, they in turn
have direct consequences in the world.

A great many frauds are generated for just this reason--war, occupation,
conquest, the control of the "historical record."

Everywhere where there are colonizers, the historical and archeological
record becomes altered, forged, erased, in order to demonstrate the "right"
of the invaders to lands which they.have stolen.
From todays paper:
Fallout From a Literary Fraud - Love and Consequences - Margaret Seltzer -
Margaret B. Jones - New York Times
http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/books/05fake.html?th&emc=th ---

Holocaust Memoir Turns Out to Be Fiction - New York Times

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/books/03arts-HOLOCAUSTMEM_BRF.html?_r=1&ref=arts&oref=login---


(The book "Mishcha's Memoire of the Holocaust years," a huge bestseller and
translated into 18 languages and made into a French film, turns out to be
fantasy which the "author" has been living out in fact her actual daily
reality.)


Mary asks if there is more re literary frauds and the like.

There is a very great deal more as I wrote the other day --

Frauds in writing are far more common and damaging than is realized, which
is why the focus tends to be on the literary  and journalistic examples of
these, as they are able to be blamed on a single person usually,  rather
than on many, which begins to entail steadily more problems in exposing and
proving what is going on, the more powerful the many are.

The reasons for the pulping of the editions of the "gang member's" book I
think it's possible may be due to clauses in the contract which were signed,
in which the author swore to the truth of her writing.  In that sense, by
the book not living up to its contract, it becomes a form of legal fraud
which the company cannot market in its present edition without breaking the
law.
I am only suggesting this as a possibility, as its marketing would
constitute, until repackaged, an example of false advertising.  In many
cases a sticker alone cannot change this, because it is the "complete
package" as it were which has been marketed as "truth" and signed to be
legally true, and is found not to be true.

Of course, the more copies of the book that are destroyed, the more those
remaining editions may someday be worth something.

(I co-managed a new/used/rare record store for six years, a business in
which there are myriad fakes, bootlegs, unlicensed copies and the like one
has to be on the look out for, because, ironically, some of them are highly
valuable due to their scarcity., often created by their having been "pulled"
for just such reasons, among a great many other strange reasons--.)


A  series of pieces i am working on for close to a year now involves
literary frauds, forgeries, the proliferation of "authors" from a single
person--both "real" and "fictional" "authors"--and as well the building up
of a form of meta-criticism which these "authors" and works create in their
wake, and within the fictions of various writers, along side the examples of
works which within the works themselves are various forms of fictions which
generate in turn real documents.

I'm interested in the ways in which the literary and artistic forgeries also
operate in a continuum of  the much larger forgeries they often distract one
from.

One finds by examining these interealtionships that literary and artistic
frauds and forgeries are a part of as well as often being for that reason
seen as apart from the much vaster ones of which they are the symptons, in
order to "control the damage" of this coming to light.

I think if one extends the existence and proliferation of the creation of
"fakes" as a sympton rather than isolated incidents, limited to the literary
sphere, they open the ways outward into which language itself functions in a
society which has long been given to the use of forgeries and fakes to
justify its actions., and itself was for centuries the  land most often
presented in  faked descriptions to attract explorers, colonists and
investements, and continues to do this daily for the seeking of the same
aboard.

The history of what is now the USA for centuries was made up of faked maps,
forged land claims, tall tales, hallucinations, fictions and minglings of
plagiarisms, inventions, forgeries and the stray fact to try to pin the
donkey to the tail so to speak.

Not surprisingly, I think this makes Americans particularly gullible, in
that one is so surrounded by the non-stop production of faked news and
"ideas" and "opinions" that the basis for determining the "truth" is largely
the same as it is for fiction--the willing suspension of disbelief. One is
told that some forms of writing are more in the possesion of truth--and if
the sales pitch is convincing enough, one goes along with it. After a while
the belief turns into fact and one lives it as an actuality. And once it
becomes an actuality, it becomes necessary to guard it, create a security
system for it and start to generate forms of conformity and regulation.

The exposure of fakes sends tremors through the various forms of writing
which see themselves as truth-based, because they reveal the crack in The
Golden Bowl as Henry James presented it.

When fakes are exposed, one witnesses a kind of scurrying to prove that not
al writing is shot through with these cancerous rhizomatic fissurings. The
great need is to quarantine the fakes so they do not contaminate the
"healthy" and "real" texts and writings. It is too much to ask of persons to
bear the idea that what they take to be real may be as fake as these "sick"
cells.

Yet the "fictional" and "real" "authors" are not limited to a single person,
but extend from small coteries and groups to such  large collectives as the
US Government's inner circles, huge news agencies, and the Dis-Information
Highways on the Internet.  A great many things which have become quite large
"bodies of knowledge" often turn out to have been based on forged or faked
or deliberately "mistranslated" bases.

In a very "real" way the world is continually awash in "fakes," "forgeries,"
"frauds," and simulations.  The art world for example is continually being
rocked by the exposure of fakes, which for a brief period open a window on
the vast number of fakes parading in the world's museums and art galleries
and private collections. The curtain has to be pulled back hurriedly, though
to protect the agents and experts and insurance companies involved.

The proliferation of faked objects, memorabilia and documents of all sorts,
of collectibles and "rare editions," and "Bibliophile" treasures has been
immense since the introduction of Ebay and other on line auctions, stores,
sellers of collectibles and low profile operators and scam artists.  (No to
mention "Antiques Roadshow's planting the hallucinatory dreams of El Dorado
in basements and at8tics throughout its viewing publics.) The moment a new
area is opened for the marketplace--whether of objects or ideas--the way is
opened for the introduction of ever more "bootlegs."

A paradox of Benjamin's critique of the "Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction" has been not the destruction of the "Aura" of the
original and unique work of art, but the mass production of millions of new
forms of "original pressings/editions/models" of manufactured objects ever
more sought after with the same fervor as was previously reserved for the
"Aura of the Original." Rather than being extinguished, the Aura has run
amok. And since the Aura has from time immemorial drawn in its wake
forgeries, fakes, copies and sometimes copies which become more valued than
the original, of course the fakes in turn run amok.

This invasion of the real by ever more fakes produces the uses of the fake
to manipulate the real on ever more grand scales.

A very dramatic example of a forgery literally exploding into the world is
the "Italian Letter" used by the US as part of their "reasons" to invade
Iraq.  The US combined the Italian Letter with the fabrications of
"Curveball" to create the causes for War which were not actually there at
all, yet in the presentation given by Colin Powell, these "fakes" convinced
the majority of Americans and many in the world that one had to strike pre
emptively the greatest evil since Hitler.
  (By then Osama Bin Missing was already relegated to the remote past-as the
Most Wanted  and Evil Man in the World. No one could really tell if the
videos he produced were real or memorex--let alone pre recorded to be played
later by anyone with a stake in his reappearances through time, whether the
US or Al Queda or someone else. Saddam has long been replaced by the
President of Iran using the usual collections of mistranslations,
"evidences" which have never surfaced and for four years now the buildup to
an attack which is generating al manner of forgeries the most recent being
the "attack" "video taped" and "audio" recorded by Iranian speed boats on an
American ship.)

Forgeries and frauds have been used for political ends throughout history,
and in recent years have become a very real problem in journalism, not just
in "memoirs."  The biggest example of them all is MEMRI which provides
almost al the news from the Mid East which is carried by the American
Media.  MEMRI is a constant practitioner of disinformation, faked
translations of planted stories, censorship by omission as well as
commission, and outright fabrication and manipulation of events and facts
which are loosely based on a kind of tangential alternate reality.  Yet,
since that is the accepted point of view which is heard and seen and read
over and over 24/7, it becomes taken as "truth."  As Josef Goebbels
said--(in paraphrase), "the longer and louder one repeats a lie--the more it
becomes accepted as the Truth."

The history of forgeries and frauds is very ancient, as throughout history
for many different reasons writers could not express what they wanted to
without resorting to various subterfuges--pseudonyms, false "translations,"
heteronyms, the forging of documents to in turn be used as the "proofs" of
the  forgeries which were in need of such "proofs," and a vast array of
stews of plagiarisms, misinformation, disinformation, fraudulent facts and
complete fabrications.  The literature of the 18th Century in England and
Europe especially is an incredible out pouring of textualities which to
shame contemporary attempts at producing various forms of hyper-hybrid
forms.  The 18th century is stupefying as well as stupendous in their
creations of multiplicities of texts and authors and translators and editors
and reference books al intermingling in ways which go farther out there than
all but a very few writers have since.

And,, not surprisingly, this proliferation was generated by the discovery of
and the race to colonize and exploit the New Worlds of the Western
Hemispheres.  In a very real historical sense, the present USA has emerged
from centuries of faked documents, plagiarized and recombined and half
invented guide books, invented tribes of Indians with invented languages and
customs, Northwest Passages, North East Passages, a multiplicity of
hallucinations and concoctions of garbled misunderstandings, mis readings,
false clues, forged maps, a continual storm of controversies and violence
generated by disputes over lands which did or not exist only on paper, as
well as rivers and mountains claimed by the creation of expeditions to the
middle of nowhere in search of El Dorados.

The USA is actually continually being "rediscovered" by the findings of
real/forged 'evidences" of the Chinese, the Phoenicians, the Vikings having
been "here"  "first," conveniently ignoring as usual that there already were
people inhabiting the vast lands, and had been for a very long time.

The first known forgery of a text not surprisingly is found  where the
earliest known texts are from--present day Iraq. Immediately that there is
writing, it reveals the possibilities of its own forgery, and,  by
extension, the creation of "authors" who never "existed," as well as ones
who did but were hidden under various guises created for public in order to
protect themselves, or to advance various strategies within the social
structures in which they hoped to climb.  (One of the desires which poets
use poetry for, in part of Bolano's formulation of this in the Nazi
Literatures book.)

One of the greatest forgers of modern times was singlehandedly undermining
the Mormon Church by the production of "fake" documents exposing the
founding documents of Mormonism themselves as fraudulent. . Hoffman also
produced a forgery not only of an Emily Dickinson manuscript, but created as
well a "previously unknown" Dickinson poem which was purchased to be used
for a collection honoring the poet in her native Amherst, and which only at
the last moment the curator who had purchased it was able to prove was a
fake.     The forms of violence which Bolano notes are related with
literature caught up dramatically with Hoffman, who murdered two people and
accidentally or not nearly car bombed himself to death.

The exposure of fakes in a sense becomes a way to have the examples of scape
goats so that one may direct the attention towards them exclusively rather
than extending the examples to essay the  directions in which they may lead
one.

Paradoxically, often the opening of writing does not occur in these cases,
but the furthering of efforts for its containment, and for the complacencies
and easy condemnations offered by these containments.

On the one hand fakes open the doors for invasions of elsewheres, and on the
other, they produce the closing of them "closer to home."

Yet if seen as being a part of and not apart from writing, the fake, taken
as a fake,  offers a further journeying into what are the possibilities of
the  real and unreal in and with writing---into the unexpected and
unknown--which the insistence on the unquestioned authority of a "reality"
which denies the possibility of its own falseness denies.

There is then a difference which opens between censure and censorship--a
thin line which is dangerously easy to cross.

If it is kept in mind that what  one works with is quite possibly a fake and
that the inquiry is not for and from a preconceived "truth"--but from an
understanding of the continually punning and doubling nature of writing
itself--then the  questioining which a fake introduces becomes an opening
outwards--

Writing as it moves on a page is erasing the open space on which it
inscribes itself. Its presence as it moves makes absent what it is erasing
by marking--yet at the same time its presence is a sign of the absence of
the other.

is it then possible  that what is absent yet present in that sign  is in
turn an erasure of what is present--and so in turn that absence becomes
re-presented--as the sign of the erasure  of what had been its own
absence--and on outwards--

The example of the fake is a way which opens further the questioning of what
is taken to be real--

By being a symptom and not an exception--

After all, in many places which are offices having a control over lives,
there is posted a sign which says--"If' it's it not in writing it never
happened."

One is tempted at times when no one is watching  to cross out the "not"--
"If it's in writing it never happened"--

or to simply add a "k" and proclaim the existence of this "knot" which is in
writing--

Remember James Frey,  his dopey confession on Oprah? "A Million Little
Pieces" would have been a decent first novel. The guy knew something about
addiction, spun a reasonably compelling narrative, etc. But gosh, some of it
was made up. Most of it was made up. What do people want -- True
Confessions?

pornography these days, but if the book's good the book's good. who
cares if it's fiction or not? it strikes me that the problem here isn't
people writing fiction and selling it as non-fiction, it's that people
can only seem to invest in a book if they're assured by the publisher
that the stories contained within are about real people and are not made
up. that these selfsame people then have the audacity to get peevish
about it when writers pull the wool over their eyes in order to get them
to pay attention to what they're saying is really just idiotic.

Poetry has no ebb and flow.  It is, it abides.  Even if you take away its "=
social" efficacy, you cannot take away its living, human fullness, profundi=
ty, autonomy.  After all, it can visibly penetrate also into those spheres =
where sleep is so active.  To "dare" to dwell in sleep, to draw nourishment=
 from it, such, if you like, is the unhurried confidence of poetry in itsel=
f - it does not need to be "shown the way," to be "authorized," to be contr=
olled (so too, correspondingly, the reader).
     Does poetry lose something in such circumstances, or does it gain?  Le=
t me leave this as an unanswered question.  The main thing is that it survi=
ves.  Drive it out of the door, it comes back through the window.**

Last night, I phoned in a poetry talk/reading to Rafael Alvarado (& Corrie Greathouse), the brains behind The Moe Green Poetry Hour on Blog Talk Radio. A good time, though somewhat uncanny as an experience of reading, since Rafael quietly listens on the other end. It was something like poetry psychoanalysis, and I was fully engaged in trying to elicit some sign from the analyst...

Pop

Sitting in his seat, a seat broad and broken

In, sprinkled with ashes,

Pop switches channels, takes another

Shot of Seagrams, neat, and asks

What to do with me, a green young man

Who fails to consider the

Flim and flam of the world, since

Things have been easy for me;

I stare hard at his face, a stare

That deflects off his brow;

I'm sure he's unaware of his

Dark, watery eyes, that

Glance in different directions,

And his slow, unwelcome twitches,

Fail to pass.

I listen, nod,

Listen, open, till I cling to his pale,

Beige T-shirt, yelling,

Yelling in his ears, that hang

With heavy lobes, but he's still telling

His joke, so I ask why

He's so unhappy, to which he replies . . .

But I don't care anymore, cause

He took too damn long, and from

Under my seat, I pull out the

Mirror I've been saving; I'm laughing,

Laughing loud, the blood rushing from

his face

To mine, as he grows small,

A spot in my brain, something

That may be squeezed out, like a

Watermelon seed between

Two fingers.

Pop takes another shot, neat,

Points out the same amber

Stain on his shorts that I've got on mine,

and

Makes me smell his smell, coming

From me; he switches channels, recites

an old poem

He wrote before his mother died,

Stands, shouts, and asks

For a hug, as I shink*, my

Arms barely reaching around

His thick, oily neck, and his broad back;

'cause

I see my face, framed within

Pop's black-framed glasses

And know he's laughing too.

================================


Underground

Under water grottos, caverns

Filled with apes

That eat figs.

Stepping on the figs

That the apes

Eat, they crunch.

The apes howl, bare

Their fangs, dance,

Tumble in the

Rushing water,

Musty, wet pelts

Glistening in the blue.

Chirot posted this a couple of weeks ago. It's a fun article. Bloom
read the Obama poems. He thought they were decent. Bloom goes on to
ridicule politicians and other public figures and their dismal verse.
He calls Jimmy Carter "the worst poet in America." Poor Jimmy. And
yet, he (Carter) remains distinguished, if only as very bad.

AH Ha ha he he.  No.  I think this does the opposite if it does anything at
all.  But I just thought ... it would be lighter hearted?  Things are not
going to end badly.  ... Oh one important thing I forgot to ask you ... tho
maybe it doesn't really affect yr opinion of other people but, does Ben like
Obama?

Subject: Foundation Questioned - Love and Consequences - Margaret B. Jones -
Margaret Seltzer - Books - New York Times

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/books/06fake.html?th&emc=th ---

here are two overlapping lists of some of the most famous literary hoaxes --
two i wrote of previously are here--

The Education of Little Tree by Forrest/Asa Carter
and the forger Mark Hoffman, a fervently anti-Mormon Mormon who rose to
become an expert on Mormon documents that he was also forging in order to
sabotage the Church by in turn forging further  documents that would prove
its founding documents were fakes, Hoffman also forged and wrote a
"previously unknown" Emily Dickinson poem that at first was "verified"  and
purchased for a collection in Amherst and then proved fake at the last hour
by the curator who had purchased it.

A really interesting character is Clifford Irving, author of the great book
FAKE which inspired the Orson Welles film of that name, which is based on
Irving's book on the forger of paintings Emile de Houry and on Irving's own
forging of the Diaries of Howard Hughes listed below. .From writing about a
forger, Irving was inspired to become one himself!!

Margaret B. Jones/Seltzer seems to have really believed in some way that her
story was real.  The day before the book was announced to be a fake, my mom
had told me about it, as she heard a show on the public radio in which Jones
had called in and talked about her life and been grilled by people who said
how could you live in a gang?  (Taking her story to be true.)

Jones/Seltzer, claiming to be half-Indian and as well involved with
drugs--and James Frey with jail and drugs--and I think many more who haven't
really "come clean" or been bothered to be looked into--play on a real and
deep interest in and empathy for persons struggling with drug problems and
at the same time the fascination with the glamorized aspects of this, as
well as the glamorized "slumming" aspects.

The sad thing is that for all the "feel good" stories like the Holocaust
Memoires and addict stories that turn out to be false, there are the true
stories which are violently attacked and ultimately "kill the messenger."

Note:  Allen Ginsberg and i often used to discuss the issues and concerns
below that are raised in part by the various fake Holocaust and
drug/gang/prison books--
often the "fake" books sell very well and get a lot of attention, and then
work agsint the actaul writings which get attacked and suppressed--

Allen for decades kept records he collected having to do with the government
involvement with drug distributions, illegal busts, corruption, uses of drug
money for various fundings of operations--which only mushroomed through the
years-

the criminalization of activism by linking it with drugs was one method  of
easily rounding people up that used to be discussed----Allen had been
interested in that before it became really an open policy in the
Sixties--the harrasement of artists, musicians and writers made easy by
their use of drugs (Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker--couldn't play in the
clubs in NYC, let alone "Birdland" just for two examples; Lenny Bruce, etc
etc)

we used to share information on government involvements with shipping of
dope related to funding overseas covert operations--

the latest revelations about the US fundings to destroy Hamas in an Iran
Contra style set up barely legal are among the few in decades that don't so
far seem to have involved dope money--

the latest ongoing example of drug money and war funding is the colassal
explosion of heroin since the US invasion of Afghanistan--each crop
exceeding the dizzying record levels of the previous--and the drug money
flowing into the drug/ar lords and now the Taliban, who stamped it out when
in power, also using it to purchase weapons and influence--
Heroin of the strongest most addictive kind ever known is flooding into the
US--treatment centers and detoxes report an astronomical rise in suburban
kids whacked out in a very short time on H

and of course the the Narco-Terrorism wars in Colombia which the US uses to
get involved in the war against FARC and saber rattling with Venezuela and
Ecuador--another potential for Invasion for oil--not to mention the massive
amount of money in cocaine--
(oil and dope:  addictions)

some of the concerns i write about below with the books which are fake or
part fake re drugs and the true writings which were attacked by the national
press and the CIA and did indeed "kill the messenger"--
The sad thing is that for all the "feel good" stories like the Holocaust
Memoires and addict stories that turn out to be false, there are the true
stories which are violently attacked and ultimately "kill the messenger."

Drug treatment programs and treatment centers, training programs for
counselors, community health centers where counseling may be had, have been
routinely slashed since the early 1990's.
The violence of crack gangs and users brought on a backlash against sympathy
for addicts--the CIA was active in introducing crack to be distributed
inititally by gangs in LA, fanning eastward.
 Journalist Gary Webb who in 1996 originally covered this for the San Jose
Mercury was attacked by all the national papers and hounded to his death,
committing suicide in 2004.  The CIA-Contra-Cocaine connection was lined to
the coordinated attack by all the nation's newspapers simultaneously on Webb
and the Mercury.

There's a very good book about this called Kill the Messenge:  How the CIA's
Crack Cocaine Controversy Destroyed Journalist Gary Webb by Nick Schou, to
go with Webb's great book Dark Alliance  The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack
Cocaine Explosion

There are two new highly touted books by the Scheff father and son to do
with the son's addiction to meth.

William S Burroughs Jr wrote an excellent book on this, with an intro by
Allen G called SPEED
The government actually labels people who are addicts and controls their
lives to some extent via this.  Getting SSI, as a "chronic substance abuser"
one has to have monies handled by a certified payee.
Its like having a prison record added to your information when you apply for
anything that requires background checks.

All those things Allen talked about and was interested in decades before I
knew him have all come true. (they were true then, just not as widely and
openly true--which means things now are worse--)


whenever I come across these things he comes to mind and his example of
always keeping alive the connections of poetry with events in the world as
not only reporting but using reporting/kerouac's sketching/Cezanne's
"motifs" as a way of seeing into the future-- his Blakean prophesies--

or reading Bolano's Chilean post 9/11 as US post 9/11 as the Shock Doctrine
coming home--
from being introduced by the US to Chile--to being introduced here--

with torture routinely going on, discussions of pre emptive strikes on more
countries, sanctioning apartheid and ethnic cleansing-all in a routine day's
work, eh--

I watched the other day the cspan of the hearings on the changing the
automatic sentencing which have been in use for crack cocaine possession and
dealing.  Crack cocaine crimes get far greater prison time and fines than do
the predominantly "white collar' cocaine crimes.  The bias of the system is
very heavily weighted against crack users, who are predominantly poor
people--Black, White and Latino.  The system is so blatantly unjust that in
the hearings there was across the board support to repeal the laws.





Top 10 literary hoaxes


15.11.2001: Afghan book author 'was never in
SAS'<http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,593834,00.html>
Bestselling author Tom Carew may have been somewhat economical with the
truth in his colourful account of his adventures in Afghanistan - according
to the Ministry of Defence, he never served in the SAS. However, Carew's
stunt is just the latest in a long line of literary hoaxes, from
Shakespearean 'discoveries' to flying saucer frauds

*Thursday November 15, 2001
guardian.co.uk <http://www.guardian.co.uk/>*

*1. The Donation of Constantine*

This Latin document, used for centuries to justify the popes' power over
mere temporal rulers, described Constantine the Great's ceding of his rights
to Pope Sylvester I, who had cured his leprosy, in the fourth century. It
was probably written in the 760s. A scholar denounced in it 1440, but the
argument continued until the 18th century.

*2. Thomas Chatterton*

The teenage Chatterton had been writing faux-medieval poems since he was 12.
In 1769, desperate to have his work published, he cashed in on the vogue for
literary antiquity by touting his verse as the work of a 15th-century monk.
The hoax was discovered, and he killed himself before his 18th birthday; but
he achieved his longed-for literary immortality as the much-beloved
"marvellous boy" of the Romantic movement.



*3. The bard Ossian*

Another poet cashing in on the primitivism craze, James Macpherson wowed the
literary world in the 1760s with fragments of a third-century epic by the
bard Ossian, which he had "translated" from the Scottish Gaelic. Goethe and
Napoleon were fans, but Samuel Johnson was sceptical from the start. It took
until the end of the 19th century for the verse to be definitively declared
an invention.

*4. Vortigern and Rowena*

The wonderful, if over-ambitious, 18th-century hoaxer William Ireland had an
anonymous friend who owned a chest stuffed with Shakespearian treasures:
love letters, a missive to Elizabeth I, annotated volumes from his library,
the manuscript of King Lear. All were judged to be authentic. However,
Ireland overdid himself when he went on to forge a lost play, Vortigern and
Rowena, in 1796. Amid a scholarly furore and much public interest, an
increasingly doubtful Sheridan mounted a production. It closed after only
one performance, and Ireland quickly 'fessed up.

*5. Protocols of the Elders of Zion*

A hoax with a pernicious and enduring legacy: the Protocols, detailing a
plot by a secret cabal of Jewish financiers to take over the world, were
probably fabricated in 1905. In the 1920s, Henry Ford fulminated against the
'secret cabal' in his anti-semitic newspaper, and fringe groups have given
the Protocols credence ever since.

*6. The Education of Little Tree*

This acclaimed autobiography of a Native American orphan discovering his
heritage and struggling against racism was actually written by Asa Carter, a
Ku Klux Klan member and the author of George Wallace's notorious speech,
"Segregation now! Segregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!" Carter's
brother described the touching memoir as an exercise in "creative writing".

*7. Fragments: Memories of a Childhood (1939-1948)*

Binjamin Wilkomirski's first-hand account of the Holocaust was a child's-eye
depiction of life in a Polish concentration camp. Published in 1995, it won
many prizes and was hailed as a classic of Holocaust literature. Four years
later, after doubts over its authenticity, it was withdrawn by its
publishers. It appears that the author hadn't sought deliberately to
deceive, but really believed the traumatic history he had invented for
himself.

*8. The Day After Roswell*

... or how the legendary flying-saucer crash outside Roswell, New Mexico in
1947 helped America win the cold war. Retired colonel Philip Corso had, he
claimed in these colourful 1997 memoirs, worked on alien technology
recovered from the crash, and managed to obtain a glowing blurb for the book
from a US senator. The senator later claimed that he'd been deceived by
Corso - his testimonial had been written for a different book altogether -
and his plug was removed from later editions.

*9. Howard Hughes's biography*

Clifford Irving claimed to have been commissioned by Hughes himself to write
a life of the notorious recluse; a delighted publisher quickly stumped up an
advance of $750,000. Irving, who had never met Hughes, was eventually
exposed when no book materialised, and he was sent to prison.

*10. The Hitler diaries*

In 1983 a German magazine bought 62 volumes of the 'lost diaries' of Adolf
Hitler. These had supposedly been discovered by farmers after the plane in
which the diaries had been dispatched, shortly before Hitler's suicide,
crashed. They contained such fascinating snippets of Hitler's domestic life
as "on my feet all day long" and "must not forget to get tickets for the
Olympic Games for Eva Braun." Historians Hugh Trevor-Roper and David Irving
were fooled, and the Times published extracts, but the forgeries were
eventually exposed as fakes, given away by their historical inaccuracies and
anachronistic inks. It later emerged that the man behind the fraud had a
long career of impersonating the Fuhrer, forging watercolours and
manuscripts of Mein Kampf.







The Busybody 20 October 2005



*1. The Donation of Constantine,* in the fourth century. Fabricated in the
eighth century by the papacy. Debunked by Lorenzo Valla in 1440. The most
famous forgery in European history, describing Constantine being cured by
Pope Sylvester I, and then rewarding him by giving the papacy power over
temporal rulers. Valla was a pioneer of certain debunking techniques,
involving the study of word usage variations.

*2. The Secret Gospel of Mark,* cited by Clement of Alexandria in the second
century. Fabricated by Morton Smith in the 1950s and placed in the Mar Saba
library in 1958. Disbelieved by Quentin Quesnell in 1973. Debunked by
Stephen Carlson in 2005. Smith's prank fooled many scholars and called forth
intriguing theories about early Christians who used an unorthodox version of
Mark's gospel. Carlson finally spotted the hilarious confessions Smith
planted in "Clement's" letter.

*3. Fragments of Ancient Poetry,* by Ossian the Bard in the third century.
Fabricated by James Macpherson in the 1760s. Disbelieved by Samuel Johnson
in 1775. Debunked at the end of the 19th century. As with Secret Mark, some
scholars were too smart to be hoodwinked, but it took almost a century and a
half to put to the ghost to rest.

*4. Letters of Historical Figures* -- Robert Boyle, Isaac Newton, Blaise
Pascal, Cleopatra, Pontius Pilate, Judas Iscariot, Joan of Arc, Cicero,
Dante, etc. All fabricated by Vrain Denis-Lucas between 1854-1868. Debunked
in 1869. Relatively short-lived, but one of the most embarrassing hoaxes
ever: all these letters were written in French, yet not only did people buy
into them -- they bought them, and Denis-Lucas ended up making hundreds of
thousands of francs off the fools.

*5. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,* by "Jewish elders". Written by
Hermann Goedsche in the 1860s, and redacted by Matvei Golovinski in the
1890s. First printed in 1897. Debunked by Lucien Wolf in 1920. But these
anti-semitic legends of a Jewish conspiracy to take over the world (and
using the blood of Christian children for passover) continued to find
adherents, mostly because the hoax played on prejudice more than gullibility
per se.

*6. Parthenopaeus,* by Sophocles in the 5th century BCE. Fabricated by
Dionysius the Renegade in the 4th century BCE. (Dionysius confessed.) One of
the most amusing hoaxes, whereby Dionysius set out to fool his rival
Heraclides and succeeded with a vengeance. Heraclides insisted that
Sophocles wrote the play even when told it was a fake. Only when Dionysius
pointed out the nasty insult embedded in an acrostic ("Heraclides is
ignorant of letters") did his rival realize he'd been had in the worst way.

*7. The Hitler Diaries,* published in 1983. Fabricated by Konrad Kujau.
Debunked soon after extracts were published in magazines like *Time*. One of
the most notorious hoaxes, especially for having fooled an expert like Hugh
Trevor-Roper. *Stern* magazine paid about ten million marks for the diaries.

*8. Vortigern and Rowena,* by Shakespeare in the 16th century. Fabricated by
William Ireland in 1790s, along with Shakespeare's love letters to Anne
Hathaway, a letter to Elizabeth I, and early manuscripts of other plays.
Debunked soon after by Edmond Malone. But that didn't prevent it from being
performed in 1796 to a packed house. Ireland had done all the forgeries to
please his father.

*9. Pedigree of the Merovingian dynasty,* recorded by Godfrey de Boullion in
the 11th century. Fabricated by Pierre Plantard in the 1960s, along with
other forged manuscripts relating to the "Priory of Sion", all of which were
placed in the Paris National Library between 1965-1967. Discredited in the
1980s. Thoroughly debunked in a 1996 BBC documentary. This hoax has had
lasting influence in the conspiracy theory promoted in *Holy Blood, Holy
Grail*, which in turn was used as a basis for the blockbuster novel, *The
DaVinci Code*.

*10. The Diary of His Excellency Ching-shan,* and other Chinese memoirs,
found in Ching-san's study in 1900. Actually fabricated by Edmund Backhouse
around this time. Denounced as a forgery in 1963. Debunked by Hugh
Trevor-Roper in 1976. Backhouse ended up donating tons of bogus manuscripts
to the Bodleian library between 1913-1923, and used other forgeries to
establish himself as an Asian scholar.

*11. The Malley Poems,* published in 1944. Fabricated by James McAuley and
Harold Stewart. McAuley and Stewart confessed that "Ern Malley" never
existed, and they had written nonsense simply to prove how easy it is to
fool people with pastiche and randomly plagiarized lines. Interesting
anecdote: the American poet John Ashbery asked his students to read a Malley
poem in conjunction with one of Geoffrey Hill's poems and decide, without
knowing in advance, which was fake. Half the students thought Malley's poem
had to be the genuine one.

*12. Fragments: Memories of a Childhood,* by Holocaust survivor Benjamin
Wilkomirski, published in 1995. Wilkomirski's real name is Bruno Dossekker,
and he's neither a Holocaust survivor nor Jewish. Debunked by Daniel
Ganzfried in 1998. Many people have excused this hoax for being emotionally
honest, a lie pointing to a greater truth which can help victims of the
Shoah.

*13. The Education of Littletree,* an autobiography of a Cherokee published
in 1976. Actually written by KKK member Asa Carter. Debunked the year it was
published. This book continues to inspire children and is still considered
good literature by some teachers, regardless of authorship and the racist
stereotypes it promotes.

*14. Poems by Thomas Rowley,* a 15th-century monk. Fabricated in 1769 by
Thomas Chatterton. Debunked soon after, and Chatterton killed himself. He
was romanticized after his suicide; many people were so moved by his poetry
and didn't care if they were forgeries.

*15. "Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of
Quantum Gravity",* by Alan Sokol. Published in 1996. Sokol soon confessed
that what he had written was nothing more than a postmodern joke. (Sokol's
hoax differs from the others on this list in that it's not a forgery; he
submitted the hoax in his own name. But it's a great example of an academic
prank done for the sake of testing one's colleagues.)

*16. The Salamander Letter,* by Martin Harris (companion of Joseph Smith) in
1830. Fabricated by Mark Hofmann in the 1980s. Debunked in 1985. Hofmann
forged other anti-Mormon documents, as well as a poem by Emily Dickinson.
Motivated partly by his hatred for Mormonism, he did it mostly for the
money, and Mormon leaders were indeed willing to pay considerable amounts to
sequester these heresies. Hofmann was a murderer too, and perhaps got his
just deserts when wounded by one of his own bombs.

*17. Notes and Emendations to the Text of Shakespeare's Plays,* from
Shakespeare in the 16th century. Fabricated by John Payne Collier in 1852.
Disbelieved by Samuel Singer and Alexander Dyce right away. Debunked by
Clement Ingleby in 1861.

*18. Irenaeus Fragments* from the second century. Fabricated by Christopher
Pfaff in 1715. Disbelieved by Scipio Maffei. Debunked by Adolf von Harnack
in 1900. Pfaff used these extracts to support his views during
Pietist-Lutheran controversies.

*19. The Autobiography of Howard Hughes,* written in 1971 (never published),
co-authored by Hughes and Clifford Irving. Actually written by Irving alone.
In 1972 Irving confessed that he never met Hughes. But before this, many
authorities who read the manuscript pronounced it genuine "beyond doubt",
and leading handwriting experts said the signatures possessed by Irving were
indeed those of Howard Hughes. Experts declared: "It is beyond human
capability to forge this mass of material."

*20. "An Amusing Agraphon",* about a verse in the Gospel of Matthew.
Fabricated by Paul Coleman-Norton in 1950. Debunked by Bruce Metzger soon
after it was published. [EDIT: see below] Known as the "denture joke", this
is one of my favorite hoaxes, in which Jesus assures people that in the
afterlife God will provide teeth to the toothless, so that everyone will be
able to weep and gnash their teeth.

*EDIT:* With regards to #20, Stephen Carlson pointed out to me that not only
did Bruce Metzger deduce the hoax before it was published, he didn't go
public with it until 1971, after Coleman-Norton's death. So I stand
corrected on two accounts. Hoax debunked in 1971.

Oh, that reminds me, I seem to remember that back in the day, Donovan put o=
ut a record on the back cover of which were printed some poems by Ho Chi Mi=
nh, along with words something like, "Is this really the enemy?" Sorry, Dav=
id, as I am even less of a scholar of Donovan or of Ho than I am of Languag=
e poetry, I can't say which album this was--it must have been one of the ea=
rly records released in the US on the Hickory label. But I did find these t=

Ho Chi Minh wrote pretty good poetry I thought. here are some prison poems
translated by Kenneth Rexroth.
http://www.zianet.com/summer/hochi.html

and don't forget the guy who apart from being a poet himself, inspired
thousands of great poems all across the world - che guevara. the day he was
executed in a Bolivian jungle, his backpack was filled with at least two
books of poetry.

A fragment of a Mao poem:

        I cut my wrists on the whipping post
                and instead of blood,
            the pity ran from my veins.

This is from memory -- I don't know who translated it.  I think the whole
poem was about the rape of Mao's wife by the Komintang.

Greetings,

Boog City=B9s looking for a small press to pinch-hit in our =B3d.a. levy lives:
celebrating the renegade press=B2 series here in nyc for one that had to bow
out. The event is on Tues. April 29, 2008 at 6:00 p.m.

Below this note is our invite letter, which spells everything out.

Please backchannel any inquiries or suggestions.

Thanks,
David

Hi,
=20
David Kirschenbaum here. I=B9m the editor and publisher of Boog City, a New
York City-based small press and community newspaper now in its 17th year.
I=B9d like to invite your press to be considered to take part in year five of
our =B3d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press=B2 series.
=20
The series is held at Chelsea=B9s ACA Galleries (http://acagalleries.com/),
which is owned by the son-in-law and daughter of the poet Simon Perchik.
It=B9s a nice space, and we fit 100 people, including a nine-piece jazz flash
orchestra, in it for Chax Press=B9s event, with plenty of room to spare. The
gallery provides wine and other beverages, and cheese and crackers and
hummus and chips.
=20
Once a month I have a different non-NYC press host and feature three or mor=
e
of their authors to read (we=B9ve had as many as 10 for one press and usually
have 3-6) for 60 minutes total. We also have a musical act perform two 15-2=
0
minute sets. If the visiting press is able to book a musical act that=B9s
preferred, so it=B9s truly their night, if not I can book one that I think
will work well with the night. (Also, once a year we play host to our NYC
brethren.)
=20
The series is held on the last Tuesday of each month, with the open date
being Tues. April 29, 2008.

We started the series in August 2003. In our first four-plus seasons we=B9ve
hosted (or will host by season=B9s end in July):

dear Barry--
thanks for the Rexroth--

the Donovan and Ho Chi Minh--wasn't this during his Maharishi Mahesh period
of lovingness of enemiesness?--

groovin with Mia Farrow and the Beatles in India--
or after?--

sometime before Jane Fonda went to North Vietnam to become immortalized in
photos analyzed in a film by Godard--

the period from "Sunshine Superman" to "From a Flower to A Garden" is kind
of a Purple Haze --or
Strawberry Fields Tet Offensives blur--on the way to "Atlantis"--

isn't this when Ron Silliman was in  Hari Krishna and first got the idea for
"Chanting"?--
and the origins of the "new sentence" came from the "new math"?--

and the Grand Piano was a Scientology recruiting center--

 and--hey--wow man--was that the gate fold album we used to use to roll bud
in?
i think i remember that one man--
i thought that was charles manson-man---not ho chi minh!

Chairman Mao, that man had a unique approach to poetics: be very ruthless and maybe you can out sell the bible. Really, I think Mao out sold the Old Testament. Imagine.

  Eugene McCarthy wrote some rather tepid, bad verse. Reading Jimmy Carter doesn't get one locked up, although I think it should get Jimmy parole time.

Barry S.) I'm pretty sure that what you are (mis)
remembering is the fact that Phil Ochs printed some
poems by Mao on the back cover of an album (a live
album, I believe), indeed accompanied by the question
"is this really the enemy?"

I guess I "wasn't there", like they say, since I
remember the 60's too well...

Pretty damn specious, I would like--you should have
friendly feelings towards a world figure because that
person is capable of decent versifying.  That sort of
sophistry is why Phil Ochs is no Favorite of mine,
though I think he was a very interesting composer and
performer and person. That in his last phase of mental
disturbance he often identified himself as "John
Train" suggests a wish to become TRANE; just as Bob
Dylan, as Charles Berstein posited in his Brooklyn
Rail essay, might have had a stronger affinity for
Free Jazz than people tend to think.

For what it's worth--maybe my 2nd favorite male folk
singer (after Dylan) is John Prine--a delightul
Populist. Onward!

It's his PROSE that rocks.  Read his memoir.  It's wonderful.

One of his mentors in Hawai`i was Frank Marshall Davis, a Harlem
Renaissance poet who
lived in Waikiki.

A reminder: SATURDAY!

Steve Dalachinsky performs
along with Jazz Poetry ensemble Frantic Turtle, with Jake Marmer
plus, onstage discussion of great recordings of poetry and music
featuring Jack Kerouac, The Last Poets, Nikki Giovanni, David Amram,
Dizzy Gillespie, Amiri Baraka, and more.

"Steve Dalachinsky was born in 1946, Brooklyn, New York.
His work has appeared extensively in journals on & off line.
He is included in such anthologies as Beat Indeed, The Haiku Moment
and the esteemed Outlaw Bible of American Poetry. His 1999 CD,
Incomplete Direction (Knitting Factory Records), a collection
of his poetry read in collaboration with various musicians, such as
William Parker, Matthew Shipp, Daniel Carter, Sabir Mateen,
Thurston Moore (SonicYouth), and Vernon Reid (Living Colour),
has garnered much praise. His latest CD is Phenomena of Interference,
a collaboration with pianist Matthew Shipp (Hopscotch Records 2005).
He has read throughout the U.S., Japan and Europe."

"Frantic Turtle merges poetry, music, and performance into
philosophically viral mixtures like existentialist dancehall, punk-
prayer,
and toasted jazz poetry. We're into strictly avant expression --
the over-fed language of the urban god-piece. And jumpy grooves
on the background to keep your ids dancing."

on Saturday, MARCH 8th, 2008, at 8 pm,
at the Yippie Museum (9 Bleecker Street, just west of Bowery, New
York, NY), around the corner from the Bowery Poetry Club.

Presented by the CUNY Graduate Center Poetics Group and Vision Fest.
$5 suggested donation at the door.

All,

  I'll be launching a new digital poetry site soon called
  netpoetic.com, the site will include biweekly digital poetry forms,
  which I will be creating to act as bridges between the print and wired
  including their source code, explanation, video talks on each etc...

  here is a preview of the first two.........comments on the first
  one are particularly sought....

Jim,

I have been watching Godard's A Woman Is a Woman a few times the last week
or so, in relation to the poem I am writing. Among the auxilliary material
in the DVD there is  quite a long publicity video where the script/text of
the movie is completely foregrounded. Watching it, one can see a completely
new way a visual poem can develop (the publicity disc, made in the early
1960's is an amazing visual poem), assimilating elements from other media,
in this case, basically abstract digital effects and background music from
1950's musical styles. Exquisitely witty, sad, lyrical, in other words,
breathtaking.

Ciao,

Murat

Barry, I will agree with Steve too. Che was a romantic revolutionary and
that's how they are. I prefer to be that way versus being a robot disguised
in human flesh, whom we often call soldiers, who are made to drink
the opium of patriotism, made to endanger the lives of their loved ones and
sent on a killing spree for a cause they don't understand very well.

To return to what was the original point of these posts, I believe: Obama's best writing is in his beautiful book Dreams From My Father, the reading of which convinced me to take Barack Obama seriously.  Regards, Tom Savage

These definitely are not bad poems for a teenager, which I take it is who or what Obama was when he wrote them.  I especially liked the one about his encounter with his father.  Regards, Tom Savage

for those Obama fans feeling a little low after his tuesday "momentum-check"
here is some mild consolation. two poems (fished out from the net) Barack
wrote in his college days.

pretty decent poems for a 19-year-old, especially the second one.

Pop

Sitting in his seat, a seat broad and broken

In, sprinkled with ashes,

Pop switches channels, takes another

Shot of Seagrams, neat, and asks

What to do with me, a green young man

Who fails to consider the

Flim and flam of the world, since

Things have been easy for me;

I stare hard at his face, a stare

That deflects off his brow;

I'm sure he's unaware of his

Dark, watery eyes, that

Glance in different directions,

And his slow, unwelcome twitches,

Fail to pass.

I listen, nod,

Listen, open, till I cling to his pale,

Beige T-shirt, yelling,

Yelling in his ears, that hang

With heavy lobes, but he's still telling

His joke, so I ask why

He's so unhappy, to which he replies . . .

But I don't care anymore, cause

He took too damn long, and from

Under my seat, I pull out the

Mirror I've been saving; I'm laughing,

Laughing loud, the blood rushing from

his face

To mine, as he grows small,

A spot in my brain, something

That may be squeezed out, like a

Watermelon seed between

Two fingers.

Pop takes another shot, neat,

Points out the same amber

Stain on his shorts that I've got on mine,

and

Makes me smell his smell, coming

From me; he switches channels, recites

an old poem

He wrote before his mother died,

Stands, shouts, and asks

For a hug, as I shink*, my

Arms barely reaching around

His thick, oily neck, and his broad back;

'cause

I see my face, framed within

Pop's black-framed glasses

And know he's laughing too.

================================


Underground

Under water grottos, caverns

Filled with apes

That eat figs.

Stepping on the figs

That the apes

Eat, they crunch.

The apes howl, bare

Their fangs, dance,

Tumble in the

Rushing water,

Musty, wet pelts

Glistening in the blue.

i've been working on cleaning up copy of the "honolulu record"--a 40s/50s
left labor newspaper out of honolulu--and frank marshall davis wrote a
weekly column called "frank-ly speaking"--great stuff, very politically
radical and savvy.  i didn't know obama had known him.  that's a very good
sign, i'd say--if he listened to anything davis said.

if anyone's interested in looking at the honolulu record, i'll put up a
note when the whole thing comes up on-line.  at the moment, there's a
shell up at
http://www.hawaii.edu/uhwo/clear/HonoluluRecord1/homepage.html.  the young
woman, sharla hanaoka, who's working on making the webpage has made a blog
out of koji ariyoshi's (the editor) editorials, and ther's some other
stuff.  the paper came out throughout the mccarthy era and during the
finagling before the u.s. got full on into vietnam.  there are some great
articles in it.

Stephen

many thanks for another vivid series of images and personas-!

i think that TRAIN not Trane is the key--
for both Ochs and Dylan--
folk music, blues, country, rock and roll all came with a lot of the sounds
of Train--
Little Richard demonstrating on the piano how his sound comes out of the
train going by--
Johnny Cash--the train going by seen from Folsom Prison--all his train
songs--
Jimmie Rodgers--The Singing Brakeman-
all the blues songs abt the trains going to Chicago or heading out of town--
and Mystery Train by Junior Parker recorded by Elvis "Big Train From
Memphis" Presley
like that late Phil Ochs lp with the cover with him in the Elvis spoofing
jacket and title--
and Dylan's Slow Train Coming

John Train could be Johnny Cash at the station singing "Hey, Porter!"--
John Train like a later way to travel of Johnny Appleseed--spreading the
seed-word-songs
the last song Hank Williams sang before getting into the car for his last
long ride was "The Old Log Train"--
a song he wrote about his father--
or John Henry who worked on the railroad and beat that steam driver down--

and John Kerouac working on the railroad with Neal Cassady as brakemen--

or it could be indeed John Coal Train
though i think it's closer to Mystery Train--
and bob dylan, too--
on his "slow train coming"--
(John the Prophet-Train--the Apocalypse Express and the Four Little Engines
that Could--)

Dear Tony,

As you read this, women in Iraq live in a Hell we have created.

In Central Iraq, 91.8% of women polled by Women for Women International say
that violence against women is increasing. 74.5% of Iraqi women avoid
leaving their homes. 63.2% have regularly not sent their children to school=
.
65.3% report that US security forces are only making security worse. One
woman who was interviewed commented, "They gave us freedom and they took
from us security=85but if I have to choose, I will choose safety and
security."

We cannot allow this to continue.

As we gear up to honor International Women's Day on March 8, let us remembe=
r
the dire situation of our Iraqi sisters. Let us use our voices to make thei=
r
voices heard.

On March 11, we will deliver a letter to every woman Member of Congress. We
will provide them with chilling information about the struggle of Iraqi
women living under occupation, and press them to take supportive action in
the next few weeks by voting to fund human needs, not warfare, in Iraq, and
legislate the return of all the troops and contractors.  We hope you will
read it yourself to learn more about the tragic circumstances they are
living in. Legislate the return of all the troops and contractors. Please
add your name to our letter
here<http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=3D2&c=3DXglwPxDd8zT=
6bGuxWGMnoKBgvQaKjLkH>.
The letter will include the Women for Women International report on the
status of Iraqi
women<http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=3D2&c=3DFTnJ1PLWgi=
sjXMA9fZE3gqBgvQaKjLkH>.

The New Asklepion Poetics and Healing
curated by Eleni Stecopoulos
with ERIC GREENLEAF and ROBERT KOCIK

Saturday MARCH 15, 2008
2:00-6:00 pm @ the Unitarian Center
1187 Franklin (at Geary), San Francisco
admission: $5

The New Asklepion. Under the holistic sign of the ancient healing sanctuary=
, we initiate an interdisciplinary dialogue among those who work at interse=
ctions of poetry, dream or altered consciousness, and healing. This special=
 afternoon-length program is guest-curated and introduced by Eleni Stecopou=
los, and features presentations by, and public conversations with writer-pr=
actitioners Eric Greenleaf and Robert Kocik.
Eric Greenleaf, Balinese Healing of the Visible and Invisible Worlds, a pre=
sentation in three parts, with original videos: 1) Ayurvedic Healing: The I=
nterior Mantram as Medicine; 2) The Balian Ketakson: Healing in Trance in t=
he Ancestors' Voices; 3) Community Trance Rituals: Healing While Possessed =
by the Gods.

A clinical psychologist and author of The Problem of Evil: Disturbance and =
its Resolution in Modern Psychotherapy, Eric Greenleaf directs The Milton H=
. Erickson Institute of the Bay Area. He does research on trance and healin=
g in Bali, teaches internationally, and trains therapists and Feldenkrais P=
ractitioners in hypnotic communication.

Robert Kocik, Designing a Prosodic Building: The Missing Science of Health,=
 Homelessness of Poetry, and Livelihood of Poets. "What, exactly, do words =
heal? Under what circumstances? The asklepian sanitarium serves as initial =
focal point for the designing of a prosodic building because it specifies a=
t once a potent function of words, the corresponding role of a language pra=
ctitioner, as well as the architectural space in which this language functi=
on was carried out. I'll focus, in particular, on the 'abaton' and the amph=
itheater-place of the secluded, epiphanic word and the public, cathartic wo=
rd, respectively."

Poet, essayist, artist, design/builder, Robert Kocik lives in Brooklyn, NY,=
 where he directs the Bureau of Material Behaviors. He is currently develop=
ing a building based on "prosody" and poets' imagined relevance to our soci=
ety. With the choreographer Daria Fain, he has initiated the Prosodic Body-=
an aesthetics or artscience based on prosody as the bringing forth of every=
thing. His publications include: Overcoming Fitness (Autonomedia, 2001), an=
d Rhrurbarb (Field Books, 2007).=20

Poetry has no ebb and flow.  It is, it abides.  Even if you take away its "=
social" efficacy, you cannot take away its living, human fullness, profundi=
ty, autonomy.  After all, it can visibly penetrate also into those spheres =
where sleep is so active.  To "dare" to dwell in sleep, to draw nourishment=
 from it, such, if you like, is the unhurried confidence of poetry in itsel=
f - it does not need to be "shown the way," to be "authorized," to be contr=
olled (so too, correspondingly, the reader).
     Does poetry lose something in such circumstances, or does it gain?  Le=
t me leave this as an unanswered question.  The main thing is that it survi=
ves.  Drive it out of the door, it comes back through the window.**

The "Decider" Decides to Torture no matter What. To put these people on trial for  the support and commission of War Crimes is not going to come too soon (as it must).
 Let's hope the Presidential candidates will make this into the campaign. We know the "monster" now, too well.


 WASHINGTON - The White House says President Bush will veto legislation on Saturday that would have barred the CIA from using waterboarding — a technique that simulates drowning — and other harsh interrogation methods on terror suspects.

 Bush has said the bill would harm the government's ability to prevent future attacks. Supporters of the legislation argue that it preserves the United States' right to collect critical intelligence while boosting the country's moral standing abroad.

 "The bill would take away one of the most valuable tools on the war on terror, the CIA program to detain and question key terrorist leaders and operatives," deputy White House press secretary Tony Fratto said Friday.

 The bill would restrict the CIA to using only the 19 interrogation techniques listed in the Army field manual.

 The legislation would bar the CIA from using waterboarding, sensory deprivation or other coercive methods to break a prisoner who refuses to answer questions. Those practices were banned by the military in 2006.

 The legislation cleared the House in December and won Senate approval last month.

An interfaith concert for peace happens at The Chicago Temple on Sunday,
March 16, beginning at 2 p.m. Here are the participants and performances:

* The Chicago Temple Handbell Ensemble performs "Transformation" and "Circle
Bell Mantra" by Australian composer Sarah Hopkins. Erik Nussbaum, who is The
Chicago Temple's Director of Music and the Arts, conducts the Handbell
Ensemble.

* Osama Zeadan (nay, mejwiz, mizmar) and Vahi Zakarian (daf, doumbek, tabla)
perform music from Iraq and Egypt.

* "Living Sculptures" is a performance art piece choreographed by Shanti
Foundation for Peace lead artist Alpha Bruton, with music by Siddha Webber
and a performance by the Ancestral Resurrection Ensemble. The dancers
dramatize, through improvisation, a metamorphosis that symbolizes
Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, and the spiritual "CRY" for world peace.
This is a cry of pain, of love, and of joy. It is not just the physical act
of crying, but an inner psychic cry, the longing and hoping, and the giving
of all you have.

* Iranian Canadian poet Saghi Ghahraman reads several poems.

* The Pan-African Junior Dance Troupe and the Interfaith All Stars Dance
Troupe give performances. These dance troupes are part of the Interfaith
Refugee and Immigration Ministries' Youth Program.

* Buddhist monks from Wat Dhammaram read verses of the Dhammapada and give
blessing chants.

* We perform Pauline Oliveros' composition entitled "The Heart Chant."

* "Four Poets Engage the Divine" (Nina Corwin, Judy Valente, Kent Foreman,
and Larry Janowski): Consider the story of the blind men and the elephant.
As each approaches the oversized beast, s/he describes, in his/her turn:
religion, spirit, faith, moral dogma, utopia, oppressive institution, answer
to the universal question. One grows up in its shadow, another goes
searching for it. One embraces it while another questions it and peers under
its skirt. One spars with it, another dances with it. At some point, we take
up our pens and attempt to share the encounter. In a time when discord
abounds in the world, often surrounding this very issue, we offer a chorus
of poems assembled in something like harmony.

* A jazz ensemble performs (Dan Godston (trumpet), David Boykin (drums), Jon
Godston (soprano saxophone), Jayve Montgomery (saxophones) and Alex Wing
(upright bass)).

There is a free will offering during this interfaith concert for peace. The
proceeds from this event will go to the Interfaith Refugee and Immigration
Ministries and the Shanti Foundation for Peace.

The Mission of Interfaith Refugee and Immigration Ministries, in partnership
with congregations, organizations, and others in Illinois, is to provide
direct services to refuges and immigrants and to encourage involvement in
world and domestic refugee issues and immigration concerns.

Shanti Foundation for Peace was established in Chicago in 1993 to foster
greater peace between cultures through the arts, education, and grass roots
community development. The Foundation accomplishes its mission by promoting
educational peace initiatives through the arts that show people how their
individual efforts can help forge lasting peace.

Shanti Foundation for Peace addresses problems of violence, racism and
intolerance that undermine families, communities and society in general. Art
is the medium we teach with as creativity and the peace process are linked:
both require brainstorming, critical thinking and respect for life. When
participants experience the power of imagination, are given a safe venue to
voice their visions and work collectively to bring these to fruition, there
is a palpable change in their level of self-respect and respect for others.
They begin to understand their ability and responsibility to affect positive
change in their world. These are building
blocks for peace.

This event is being organized by the Borderbend Arts Collective. For more
information, please contact Dan at 312.543.7027 or dgodston@sbcglobal.net.

The play "Aunt Dan and Lemon" by Wallace Shawn deals with this subject matter. It was one of the 2 or 3 best plays of the eighties. As for my earlier post,  I was rather drunk.  I'm not sure if the Drunk me is the Real me so I won't disown the comment.

  Violence does seem necessary, too often. For the powerless, it's a form of speech. It's hard to ignore a bomb. Explosions speak louder...

3 z-axis non-scaled mods from Foofwa/Kira mocap
trilled/waltz are from the same bvh; one presents sheave-skin interior


This is as close as I can get to... ...gutsy organs, sloughed wade.
It's not very close; the sheave-skin breaks into air. I'd note that even
its mathematical substructure defines manifolds emptied of anything but
nurbs, splines, whatever - tension across the sheave.

Or rather the sheave/manifold - tension defined on the two-dimensional
curved surface. One might draw vectors for example. One pulls, pushes -
directly or through bvh and other manipulations. Mobility/intention in
Second Life for example.

These vectors breathe in the surrounding space. With poles and polars,
space is on the move. So you're saying? That abstractions, mapping, might,
on a metaphorical level, pucker just about everywhere, a slid ontology.

It's sight, then? It's sight, or rather what's seen is what's sheave.
Although of course one might make sheave or sheaves invisible; it's an
option.

And there might be invisibilites built-in - everywhere, in SL, in Poser,
across the true world? Yes, what we call ghosts are only these slid
ontologies.

hi jason,

i'm interested in netpoetic.com. could you tell me more about it? is this a
sort of 'how to' site? how do you see netpoetic.com as bridge between print
and wired?

the most popular page on vispo.com is lee worden's cutup machine (
http://vispo.com/cgi-bin/wonder/cutup/cutup.cgi ). this is really the only
'tool' on the site. i think it's popular because it's well-done, simple,
easy to use, and featureful. but, also, because it's a tool. that writers
and amateurs can use in *their work* or occassionally as entertainment. it's
not an art work of a typical kind, if it's an art work.

it has certain properties that are art-like. it's entertaining. it creates
an archive of work that you can choose to participate in or not. it creates
writing that is of some utility to those who use the tool/work. it changes
peoples' ideas about writing. not in an original way (the cutup is not lee's
idea of course). but it lets people experience what the cutup does with
language quite easily and thoroughly. it engages people with writing in an
unusual way, and engages them quite strongly.

of course it doesn't have certain properties we associate with art works. it
doesn't supply any of the content. just the form, and only part of the form,
since the original writing put into it also determines the form of what the
cutup engine produces.

but it's interesting to think about art that combines aspects of art and of
the tool. like a manual that isn't really a manual. or a 'how to' site that
isn't really a 'how to' or is in part but is also art work in part.

are these issues relevant to netpoetic.com?

ja?

Glad to see mention of Ho's poems on this site.
Tinfish published a wonderful chap, translated by Steve Bradbury, which
is still in print.
Please see http://tinfishpress.com under "chapbooks."

As for Obama and Frank Marshall Davis, there was an article in the NYT
about a year
ago about O's memoir, which mentioned "a poet who lived in Waikiki."  I
wrote to tell
the author that this was none other than FM Davis.  She responded that
she knew this,
but didn't want "to out him."  What do you suppose that meant???

aloha, Susan

Recently during some of the Ezra Pound kerfluffle on the list, I
Googled up an article from a weekly paper in Knoxville, Tennessee on
a Pound ephebe who came to Knoxville to fight, with Ez's nod, the
evil that was desegregation. Given the recent appearance of The
Education of Little Klansman on the list, I thought I'd pass along
this URL:

I often enjoy Neely's articles; he's been one of the few bright spots
in my recent move to Knoxville, aside form the glow in the sky to the
northwest that is the radioactive (no kidding: they've had problems
with radioactive ducks and radioactive trees) campus of Oak Ridge
National Laboratories.

 You begin to sense the byshadows that stretch from the awe of global
 dominance. How the intersecting systems help pull us apart, leaving
 us vague, drained, docile, soft in our inner discourse, willing to be
 shaped, to be overwhelmed -- easy retreats, half beliefs. Works of art
 are complex formal interventions within discursive traditions and their
 myriad filiations. These interventions are defined precisely by their
 incomparable capacity to trace the dynamics of historical process in
 paradoxical gestures of simultaneously prognostic and mnemonic
 temporalities.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from { brad
brace }. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history. This
discourse, far from determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding
the ground on which it could find support. It is trying to operate a
decentering that leaves no privilege to any center.

  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present
of the Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

 You begin to sense the byshadows that stretch from the awe of global
 dominance. How the intersecting systems help pull us apart, leaving
 us vague, drained, docile, soft in our inner discourse, willing to be
 shaped, to be overwhelmed -- easy retreats, half beliefs. Works of art
 are complex formal interventions within discursive traditions and their
 myriad filiations. These interventions are defined precisely by their
 incomparable capacity to trace the dynamics of historical process in
 paradoxical gestures of simultaneously prognostic and mnemonic
 temporalities.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from { brad
brace }. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history. This
discourse, far from determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding
the ground on which it could find support. It is trying to operate a
decentering that leaves no privilege to any center.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present
of the Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

		   [ see http://www.eskimo.com/~bbrace/netcom/books.txt ]

Hi there,

It is still winter outside. Hopefully we're closer to the END of it.
At the beginning of this winter, I video taped the Sound Poetry Event
at Minnesota Center for Book Arts, Minneapolis . Took me a while, but
finally I uploaded the video sequences of the event to my youtube
account.


Here are the links:

Subject:      Rezko: Could Obama Be Finished Politically? (The Pope),Bob
              Cellini. (The Rabbi), Stuart Levin

  Interesting reading. Rezko is a Syrian immigrant. He has ties to an Iraqi billionaire living in London who was associated with the Saddam regime and oil for food money. It has not been proven that any of that money went to Obama. But some certainly went to Rezko. Obama and the Iraqi did meet briefly when the Iraqi was in Chicago. The foreign connections with Iraq and Hussien make this way more explosive than anything with the Rose law firm or Whitewater. The Whitewater investigation basically wrecked the Clintons for years. There is already a federal prosecutor involved. Auchi, the Iraqi has an incredibly sordid history of dealing with Hussien, Khaddafi, etc. Questions are coming up about why Obama was against the war. He may have been right for entirely different reasons than people think. The dots are not all connected, which is why Obama is not yet finished as a politician.
  Nadhmi Auchi was charged along with Saddam Hussein for conspiring to assassinate Iraqi President Abdul-Karim Qasim in 1959. Qasim was injured while his bodyguard was killed; Saddam managed to flee the country. Auchi was arrested for delivering weapons to the assassins but was later pardoned by President Qasim
  Could it perhaps be because of Obama's 15-to-20-year friendship with indicted Syrian and Chicago resident Tony Rezko, his political fundraiser patron? Could it possibly be because of Rezko's long-term relationship with exiles and former residents of Iraq, Syria and Jordan, many of whom have either resided in or visited Chicago?
  Could it possibly be because of Rezko's affiliation with corrupt Iraqi-British billionaire Nadhmi Auchi, the long-time bagman for Saddam Hussein's secret money-laundering trail, to whom Rezko was "introduced several years" prior to 2005 "by a mutual acquaintance in London" and with whom he entered into a multi-million dollar 62-acre Chicago development deal, and the source of the $3.5 million "loan" wired from a Middle East bank that landed Rezko back in jail January 29, 2008, to await jury selection March 3, 2008?
  Could it possibly be because of Rezko's affiliation with corrupt Iraqi exile and Chicago resident Aiham Alsammarae who returned to Iraq in 2003 to serve as the Coalition Provisional Authority's minister of electricity and who was jailed in Iraq in relation to missing millions in reconstruction funds?
  Could it possibly be because of the joint plan in 2003 by Rezko, Auchi and Alsammarae to build a power plant in Kurdish Iraq—a plan yet unfilled as recently as December 2006?
  Brush aside Obama's claims of being guilty of making "bone-headed" mistakes in regards to his Rezko-related issues. This very significant one-degree of separation between himself and Rezko's Iraqi business partners and Saddam Hussein is much more troubling.
  The apparently now dead-in-the-water plan for the Iraqi power plant—a plan, by the way, openly discussed by Chicago media—raises greater concerns about his judgement where his ties to Rezko are concerned, extending far beyond the unseemly Rezko-facilitated Obama house deal in Chicago or any other assumptions or assertions about political pay-to-play in Illinois.
  Recently, Chicago political blogger Bill Baar raised questions about the connections between Baghdad and Chicago, saying that   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Ill.), Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, "[may] not [be] looking hard enough. There is a fascinating trail of philanthropy between Chicago and Baghdad worth sorting out, and considerable sorting it's going to take."  On February 5, 2008, Baar added in regards to the upcoming Rezko trial:
  We're going to hear blunt recordings from [the] man who was Obama's mentor for over 17 years with guys who called themselves "The Pope" (Bob Cellini) and "The Rabbi" (Stuart Levin). They're going to sound like players out of the Sopranos raising money for Obama: the unamed Political Candidate in the proffer. (A connection leaked to the [Chicago] Sun Times by maybe Levine or Rezko themselves? I doubt Fitz's office did that.)
  All it takes is for Obama's name to pop up a few more times in these documents and recordings and I think Obama will be finished politically. Won't matter if Obama knew about the wrongdoing or not.
  Add in the Iraq reconstruction connection when Rezko goes on trial for that, and I think it will be a very damaging picture of Obama's character and judgement. He won't survive Illinois politics and Patrick Fitzgerald.
  We can only hope.

  This article is cross-posted from RezkoWatch.
  The indictment of Rezko on federal charges has drawn attention to his relationship with Illinois Senator Barack Obama, though Obama is not accused of wrongdoing.[9][10]
  In November 2006, Obama drew media scrutiny when it came to light that in 2005, he had purchased his house on the South Side of Chicago for $300,000 below the asking price on the same day that Rezko's wife, Rita, purchased the adjoining empty lot for the full asking price.[11] The lots had originally been a single lot, but the previous owners decided to sell the land as two separate lots and, according to Obama, the owners required that the sale of both lots be closed on the same date.[12] Obama subsequently bought a 10 foot (3.0 m) wide strip of Rita's property for $104,500, $60,000 above the assessed value.[11] According to Chicago Sun-Times columnist, Mark Brown, "Rezko definitely did Obama a favor by selling him the 10-foot strip of land, making his own parcel less attractive for development."[13] Obama acknowledges that the exchange may have created the appearance of impropriety, and stated "I consider this a mistake on my part and I regret it."[12] On December 28,
 2006, Rita sold the property to a company owned by her husband's former business attorney for $575,000, netting a profit of $54,500 prior to expenses and property taxes.[14] In October 2007, the new owners put the still vacant land up for sale again, this time for $1.5 million.[15]
  In June 2007, the Sun-Times published a story about letters Obama had written in 1997 to city and state officials in support of a low-income senior citizen development project headed by Rezko and partner Allison Davis. The project received more than $14 million in taxpayer funds, including $885,000 in development fees for Rezko and Davis. Of Obama's letters in support of the Cottage View Terrace apartments development, Obama spokesman Bill Burton said "This wasn't done as a favor for anyone, it was done in the interests of the people in the community who have benefited from the project. I don't know that anyone specifically asked him to write this letter nine years ago. There was a consensus in the community about the positive impact the project would make and Obama supported it because it was going to help people in his district." Rezko's attorney responded that "Mr. Rezko never spoke with, nor sought a letter from, Senator Obama in connection with that project.[16]
 Obama had told the Sun-Times that Rezko raised "between $50,000 and $60,000" during Obama's political career, although the New York Times reports a total of about $150,000.[9] Since then, Obama has returned or donated to charity more than $84,000 of funds linked to Rezko.[17]

Violence does seem necessary, too often. For the powerless, it's a form of speech. It's hard to ignore a bomb. Explosions speak louder...

Ho Chi Minh wrote pretty good poetry I thought. here are some prison poems
translated by Kenneth Rexroth.

Aime Cesaire (I'm leaving off the accents) was a poet politician (in

how strange...  she didn't want to out obama or fmd?  from what i've read,
fmd was far more radical than obama.  maybe she didn't want to put into
question fmd's radicality or... make obama look too radical?  can you ask
her?  all best, gabe

Of the most beautiful captured images of dance


Last night I thought: Karl Krauss and Nietzsche, stillborn, damaged; no
matter how clear the crystal, how strong an insistent dna produces those
semblances of originary moments, everything disappears in the end. Or in
the end is wounded, a wound. Nothing from the past needs to / can / heal;
the past is superseded, bypassed; culture and species take circuitous
routes. Death churns bodies as homes and habitus dissolve. These dances,
however striated, remain unique as orbitals; our lab room will is perhaps
close to abandonment, outside the snow is falling, perhaps for the very
last time.

I. results from the large Cyrex laser: Foofwa solo / Foofwa & Azure &
Kira, 27 small gifs - http://www.alansondheim.org/ the lasedance series.

II. With Motion Builder scaffolding, not too large -
http://www.alansondheim.org/booboo.mp4 - the last of the bvh transformed.

The lasedance series is cloud clusters; it takes, as Gary Manes would have
it, considerable AI to decide on object choices. So these are raw data
files which are by far the most beautiful, convey the most information.
When you look at the gifs, click on the + sign to see them at the original
size; otherwise, you'll get odd moire patterns which can be nuisance.

The exaggerated perspective exalts the performative aspects of the poses
which capture in fact a compressed space-time dynamic. In booboo (named
after Rat Pfink a Boo Boo) it's inverse; the motion is de/jected, reduced
to that of an alien crab or daddy-long-legs (neither insect nor spider).

Five yeses to these: yes yes yes yes yes.

From "B" a Road Movie:

Fast food drive-thru.

RITA [From speaker]: I am Living Water, a submissive woman. Order on-line .=
.. release your pain ... I am the message that Christ's come again.

LEONARD [Loudly, leaning out car window, into intercom mic]: Uhhh, can I ge=
t two double-decker supremes, a chicken chalupa-wrap, a, uh nacho cheesebur=
ger, uh, the uh, and, uh - what do you guys want to drink?

RITA [Speaker noise]: I am the water that quenches your thirst, I am the la=
st, I was the first. I am one with what the tree vole drinks.

BABARA [Yelling over LEONARD's shoulder]: Hey, why does Jesus never say, "I=
 am the water of life"?

DUTCH: That's a very good question.

RITA [More speaker noise]: I am the elf in the trees. I am the mermaid of y=
our peach. I am the water's wash of flame's desire. See my quest in the wor=
ds you hear, in the songs of the no-wind-in-there.

LEONARD [Snorts]: ... I am Big Water, Big Water is me!

RITA [Encouraged]: I am the ocean, the lake, the river, pond and creek. I a=
m the mountains, the valleys, the desert and the trees. I am Earth ...

DUTCH: ... Ich bin der Dreck unter deinen Walzen, Ich bin dein geheimer Sch=
mutz Und verlorenes Metallgeld, Ich bin deine Ritze, Ich bin ...

BARBARA: God, I feel like I'm drinking water ...

RITA: Air I am. Fire I am. Water, earth and Spirit I am. Breeze I am. Sun I=
 am. Brook, Mountain and Goddess ...

CHORUS OF AUTOMOBILES: Honk! Honk! HONK!

BARBARA: I'm wearing: Hot Pink & Black Zebra Striped Skirt, Black Lace Trim=
med Shirt. Soon I will have vegetarian un-chicken nuggets with everything t=
hat lives in water. Until then, I'm gnawing on water --

LEONARD [Forcefully, into intercom mic]: You are my licorice. I am your dan=
delion; you are my first wish. I am your water wings; you are my deep. I am=
 your open arms; you are my running leap.

BARBARA and DUTCH: I am the house that protects you I am the car that takes=
 you places I am the water that you drink I am the food that you eat I am t=
he pencil that you write --

RITA [Speaker noise]: My name is Orianna. I am a rainbow goddess. I am wate=
r, gas and sunshine. I live in the clouds. I make rainbows. I feel happy be=
cause I'm making other kids ... oh, wait, no [Sudden shame.] ... pride ... =
ohhh ... pride ... my ... scalp ... begins to tighten. Have mercy! Lord, I =
am afraid! Water, I thirst, I thirst!=20

LEONARD [Shouting into intercom mic]: I am like water, whose surface you ha=
ve disturbed! You see your reflection in me - distorted!

RITA [Sudden strength]: I AM THE THUNDERBOLT AMONG WEAPONS, AND I AM THE WA=
TER GOD AND THE NAMES. I AM THE CONTROLLER OF DEATH.

Dear Colleague,



The writing workshop model, the staple of the creative writing program since
the Iowa model, is over one-hundred years old. Some writers/teachers contend
that the workshop is alive, working well, and good for the profession.
Others suggest that given the recent galvanization of the creative writing
field and the increasing enrollment in creative writing programs across the
nation, theory and pedagogical issues regarding the writing workshop model
have become pressing and valid concerns.



This survey (click on the link below) presents an opportunity for you as a
creative writing teacher to respond to the question: The Writing Workshop
Model: Is It Still Working?



http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=5IoA2U20DZaQ7G7wokZnKQ_3d_3d



Collected responses will be critical to scholarship that will assess the
patterns and practices of the workshop model across many undergraduate
creative writing programs in the nation.



Your contribution (your response can be anonymous) is both appreciated and
important to the on-going dialogue on the status of the writing workshop
model.



Thank you for your time and response.



Best,

David,

Also, trains fill the movies, particularly of the fifties and sixties. Ozu,
the Taiwanese director HHH, Godard, etc., all have scenes in trains (or
waiting at train stations), often for the mere pleasure of recording the
passage of time, or objects passing by outside the window. There are so many
movie strips where the train is entering a tunnel or coming out of it. What
about Hitchcocks, North by Northwest or Strangers on the Train, or the
Westerns or Anna Karenina at the train station meeting her future lover for
the first time or killing herself? Of course, the famous Lumiere shot of the
train rushing the audience, etc., etc.

What about the great train stations of iron construction, the demolition of
one of which in New York City, The Pennsylvania Station, started the
architectural preservation movement in the city. To think that I was in New
York when the building stood up and I never went to see it, while I spent
hours and hours at all night movie houses at Times Square (also early
sixties).

Trains are our technological dream objects, man-made (synthetic) rivers. I
am reading Chris Funkhouser's* Prehistoric Digital Poetry* (a fascinating
book) at the moment and these questions are on my mind.

Easy
Like drinking from
The tap water.

When minarets
Are at the train window
In Erzurum,
Drinking tea
Reminds me of you
Darling

Ciao,

Murat

Dear Colleague,



The writing workshop model, the staple of the creative writing program since
the Iowa model, is over one-hundred years old. Some writers/teachers contend
that the workshop is alive, working well, and good for the profession.
Others suggest that given the recent galvanization of the creative writing
field and the increasing enrollment in creative writing programs across the
nation, theory and pedagogical issues regarding the writing workshop model
have become pressing and valid concerns.



This survey (click on the link below) presents an opportunity for you as a
creative writing teacher to respond to the question: The Writing Workshop
Model: Is It Still Working?



http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=5IoA2U20DZaQ7G7wokZnKQ_3d_3d



Collected responses will be critical to scholarship that will assess the
patterns and practices of the workshop model across many undergraduate
creative writing programs in the nation.



Your contribution (your response can be anonymous) is both appreciated and
important to the on-going dialogue on the status of the writing workshop
model.



Thank you for your time and response.



Best,

Dear Murat and Friends--

I learned something today regarding a topic i've been following for some
time--
which Wordforword will bepublishing a pice i did on :  "Waterboarding,
Translation & Poetry"--
a year ago i started sending my mother drawings i made with "Waterboarding"
being a form of "surfboarding"--
and so when Mulkasey couldn't answer questions about what he thought it
was--
I did more drawings of his confusion as he thought only of "surfboarding"--
as a form of getting around even seeing the image in his mind of
"waterboarding"--
so as not to utter a word in this regard and blow things wide open for his
bosses--

it turns out that what was a  kind of "gallows" half serious-half joking
series of drawings and postcards and invented "news stories" i sent  in the
last year is indeed connected with a form of humor itself--
although one that is a bit more literal than one may necessarily like, but
then that is the way language works--

i found by surprise- today via link to an old William Safire's column that
indeed Waterboarding and Surfboarding ARE related!

Why did *boarding* take over from *cure*, *treatment* and *torture*? Darius
Rejali, the author of the recent book "Torture and Democracy" and a
professor at Reed College, has an answer: "There is a special vocabulary fo=
r
torture. When people use tortures that are old, they rename them and alter
them a wee bit. They invent slightly new words to mask the similarities.
This creates an inside club, especially important in work where secrecy
matters. *Waterboarding* is clearly a jailhouse joke. It refers to
surfboarding" =97 a word found as early as 1929 =97 "they are attaching som=
ebody
to a board and helping them surf. Torturers create names that are funny to
them."

so the "associative trains of thought"--
rolling along--
associative trains of thought" have always been among my favorites to
ride--always a most excellent and surprising and interesting and
entertaining mode of "transport"--


Thank you for your trains , Murat
Or as the Box Tops' song has it:  "Trains and Boats and Planes"--which
included in the recording the sounds of ,-yes!--trains and boats and
planes--honking, hooting, taking off----

"associative trains of thought" have always been among my favorites to
ride--always a most excellent and surprising and interesting and
entertaining mode of "transport"--

*Emerson writes in "Nature" as i recall of the train being a way of
changing the perceptions of things "passing by"  --suddenly the landscapes
are completely different--and as well--sounds are changed--*

*Emerson notes how from a carriage with windows up--the persons seen on
streets as one passes them by take on the air of a kind of "dumbshow"--and
this is further exaggerated by the views from trains on coming into and
leaving stations--*

even Thoreau and Emily Dickinson have trains appear in poems and
surprisingly for many Greens, in a positive fashion--despite their being
associated with "ecologies" of the wilds and of the wilds of one's flower
and vegetable gardens and attendant insects and birds--
a book you might want to look into is

The *Railway Journey*: The Industrialization and Perception of Time and
Space: Wolfgang Schivelbusch  although the number of fascinating books abou=
t
trains from al over the world is immense--

and then there's of course "Prose of the Trans-Siberian" by Blaise
Cendrars--

and a Train which was given  huge amount of poetry (most famously by
Whitman) and prose and photographed by the "greats" of the day as well as a
great many citizens with cameras-- Lincoln's Funeral Train --carrying his
body from the Capitol back to Illinois--

there are so many thousands and thousands of train songs--

i simply chose first to look up "Mystery Train" which mentioned before, as =
I
worked six years in a new/used/rare record store of that name--

i include here the history of the song and a partial listing of the version=
s
of it that have been done--(i can think of many myself that aren't here--)

i also looked up for fu another favorite one--"I heard that Lonesome Whistl=
e
Blow"--which has also been covered by hordes of musicians--

for the Dylanologists present--

i included the listings of the recrded versions Dyaln has done of this song
through time--

as you can see, he has also covered "Mytery Train"

and who can forget his own "It tTakes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to
Cry"??!!


one of my all time favorite songs with a train in it--is Little Milton's
version of the Chuck Willis song, "Feel So Bad" which was also covered by
Elvis and about a hundred others--

the lyrics are very amazing since childhood some of the most enigmatic and
powerful lines i know of have been to this day:

I feel so bad, just like a ball game

on a rainy day

yes i said--I feel so bad--just like a ballgame--

on a--on a rainy day--
I feel so bad you 'all
i just grab a train
and ride away ride away
grab a train an ride away--


here;'s the Mystery Train lyrics and history, some of the zillion artists
who have covered it, and following "I heard that Lonesome Whistle Blow"--


and a very strange part of "Mystery Train" being played in Iraq while
contracftors are firing at citizens to cause chaos--the song is heard in th=
e
back ground--

*Mystery Train Lyrics*


(words & music by h. parker - s. philips)
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well that long black train got my baby and gone

Train train, comin round, round the bend
Train train, comin round the bend
Well it took my baby, but it never will again (no, not again)

Train train, comin down, down the line
Train train, comin down the line
Well its bringin my baby, cause shes mine all, all mine
(shes mine, all, all mine)

"*Mystery Train*" is a song written by Junior
Parker<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Parker>and Sam
Phillips <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Phillips>. It was first recorded
in Phillip's Memphis Recording Service and Sun
Records<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Records>at 706 Union Avenue,
Memphis, Tennessee in 1953. Raymond Hill and Matt
Murphy were in the backing band with Bill Johnson on piano, Pat Hare on
guitar, and John Bowers on drums. The band was listed on the label as Littl=
e
Junior's Blue Flames <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Parker>. "Mystery
Train" and "Love My Baby" was released late in 1953 on Sun #192, and from
the beginning the sound and feel of "Train" gave Parker his first taste of
fame and name recognition.[1]<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Train#_n=
ote-0>

Elvis Presley <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley>'s version of
"Mystery Train" was first released on August 20, 1955 as the B-side of "I
Forgot to Remember to
Forget<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Forgot_to_Remember_to_Forget>"
(Sun 223). It was again produced by Sam
Phillips<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Phillips>at Sun Studios, and
featured Presley on vocals and rhythm guitar, Scotty
Moore <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotty_Moore> on lead guitar and Bill
Black <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Black> on bass. RCA Victor
rereleased this recording in December of 1955 (#47-6357) after acquiring it
as part of a contract with
Presley.[2]<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Train#_note-1>This
version of the song peaked at #11 on the national Billboard Country
Chart.[3] <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Train#_note-2>

In early December of 2005, the US
Army<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Army>initiated a probe on a video
which first appeared on the
Internet <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet> showing contractors
in Iraq<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq>firing at civilians while
Elvis'
*Mystery Train* is being played in the background. The video purports to
show the firing of automatic rifles shooting into traffic, causing civilian
vehicles to swerve and crash on the dusty West Baghdad roads.

I was riding number nine,

Goin' south from Caroline.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.



Got in trouble, had to roam,

Left my gal, I left my home.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.



Just a kid actin' smart,

I went and broke my baby's heart.

I guess I was too young to know.



They took me off the Georgia main,

Locked me to a ball and chain.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.



All I do is sit and cry,

As the evenin' train goes by.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.



I'll be locked here in this cell

Till my body's just a shell.

And my head turns whiter than snow.



I haven't seen that gal of mine

'Cos I'm in Georgia doin' time.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.



I'll be locked here in this cell

Till my body's just a shell.

And my head turns whiter than snow.



I'll never see that gal of mine

'Cos I'm in Georgia doin' time.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.  [image: up]

I was riding number 9,

Goin' south from Carolina.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.



I got in trouble, had to roam,

Left my gal, left my home.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.



Just a kid acting smart,

I went and broke my darling's heart.

I guess I was too young to know.



They took me off that Georgia plane,

They locked me to a ball and chain.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.



All I do is bend in shame,

I'm a number, not a name.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.



I'll be locked here in this cell

Till my body's just a shell

And my hair turns whiter than snow.



I'll never see that gal of mine

'cause I'm in Georgia doing time.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.



I'll be locked here in this cell

Till my body's just a shell

And my hair turns whiter than snow.



I'll never see that girl of mine

'cause I'm in Georgia doing time.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.



All I do is sit and cry

As the evening train goes by.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.



Just a kid acting smart

I went and broke my darling's heart.

I guess I was too young to know.



They took me off the Georgia plane

Locked me to a ball and chain.

I heard that lonesome whistle blow.  [image: up]

Hi all,

I have long considered gathering together selected poems from my
out-of-print chapbooks into a selected edition for publication. However,
considering both the current focus on two works-in-progress, as well as the
vagaries of publishing itself (especially placing older work by an
underground/indie poet), I've not gotten much beyond the planning stages of
such an edition.

Until now. Due to a specific request from a friend of mine in Europe, I have
assembled an e-book of some past work. I surprisingly like the flow of this
assortment, so if nothing else it's infused me with new enthusiasm to
resurrect this work in particular and put it out there, hoping (of course)
to develop a wider audience because of it.

If anyone is interested in receiving this e-book in PDF format, contact me
via back channel and I'll happily forward it your way.

Thanks in advance,
Larry

David, thanks for putting so much re trains - lyrics thereof - into the "round-house"!

 Lets not forget John Coltrane - one of this country's ulitmate ('tranes')

 The proverbial Night Train (poems, music et al) only way to begin to survive the consequence of what is going on here.  Bush, Pinochet, Franco, Stalin what's the Big Dif. "Executive Privilege" read "Dictator" read "Torture" is quite alright, etc. Let's call it "Enhanced Executive Privilege".

 What's that piece by who, "The Infidels"? More than ever, time to assert that, I'd say.

David Chirot <david.chirot@GMAIL.COM> wrote: Dear Murat and Friends--

I learned something today regarding a topic i've been following for some
time--
which Wordforword will bepublishing a pice i did on :  "Waterboarding,
Translation & Poetry"--
a year ago i started sending my mother drawings i made with "Waterboarding"
being a form of "surfboarding"--
and so when Mulkasey couldn't answer questions about what he thought it
was--
I did more drawings of his confusion as he thought only of "surfboarding"--
as a form of getting around even seeing the image in his mind of
"waterboarding"--
so as not to utter a word in this regard and blow things wide open for his
bosses--

it turns out that what was a  kind of "gallows" half serious-half joking
series of drawings and postcards and invented "news stories" i sent  in the
last year is indeed connected with a form of humor itself--
although one that is a bit more literal than one may necessarily like, but
then that is the way language works--

i found by surprise- today via link to an old William Safire's column that
indeed Waterboarding and Surfboarding ARE related!

Why did *boarding* take over from *cure*, *treatment* and *torture*? Darius
Rejali, the author of the recent book "Torture and Democracy" and a
professor at Reed College, has an answer: "There is a special vocabulary for
torture. When people use tortures that are old, they rename them and alter
them a wee bit. They invent slightly new words to mask the similarities.
This creates an inside club, especially important in work where secrecy
matters. *Waterboarding* is clearly a jailhouse joke. It refers to
surfboarding" — a word found as early as 1929 — "they are attaching somebody
to a board and helping them surf. Torturers create names that are funny to
them."

so the "associative trains of thought"--
rolling along--
associative trains of thought" have always been among my favorites to
ride--always a most excellent and surprising and interesting and
entertaining mode of "transport"--


Thank you for your trains , Murat
Or as the Box Tops' song has it:  "Trains and Boats and Planes"--which
included in the recording the sounds of ,-yes!--trains and boats and
planes--honking, hooting, taking off----

"associative trains of thought" have always been among my favorites to
ride--always a most excellent and surprising and interesting and
entertaining mode of "transport"--

*Emerson writes in "Nature" as i recall of the train being a way of
changing the perceptions of things "passing by"  --suddenly the landscapes
are completely different--and as well--sounds are changed--*

*Emerson notes how from a carriage with windows up--the persons seen on
streets as one passes them by take on the air of a kind of "dumbshow"--and
this is further exaggerated by the views from trains on coming into and
leaving stations--*

even Thoreau and Emily Dickinson have trains appear in poems and
surprisingly for many Greens, in a positive fashion--despite their being
associated with "ecologies" of the wilds and of the wilds of one's flower
and vegetable gardens and attendant insects and birds--
a book you might want to look into is

The *Railway Journey*: The Industrialization and Perception of Time and
Space: Wolfgang Schivelbusch  although the number of fascinating books about
trains from al over the world is immense--

and then there's of course "Prose of the Trans-Siberian" by Blaise
Cendrars--

and a Train which was given  huge amount of poetry (most famously by
Whitman) and prose and photographed by the "greats" of the day as well as a
great many citizens with cameras-- Lincoln's Funeral Train --carrying his
body from the Capitol back to Illinois--

there are so many thousands and thousands of train songs--

i simply chose first to look up "Mystery Train" which mentioned before, as I
worked six years in a new/used/rare record store of that name--

i include here the history of the song and a partial listing of the versions
of it that have been done--(i can think of many myself that aren't here--)

i also looked up for fu another favorite one--"I heard that Lonesome Whistle
Blow"--which has also been covered by hordes of musicians--

for the Dylanologists present--

i included the listings of the recrded versions Dyaln has done of this song
through time--

as you can see, he has also covered "Mytery Train"

and who can forget his own "It tTakes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to
Cry"??!!


one of my all time favorite songs with a train in it--is Little Milton's
version of the Chuck Willis song, "Feel So Bad" which was also covered by
Elvis and about a hundred others--

the lyrics are very amazing since childhood some of the most enigmatic and
powerful lines i know of have been to this day:

I feel so bad, just like a ball game

on a rainy day

yes i said--I feel so bad--just like a ballgame--

on a--on a rainy day--
I feel so bad you 'all
i just grab a train
and ride away ride away
grab a train an ride away--


here;'s the Mystery Train lyrics and history, some of the zillion artists
who have covered it, and following "I heard that Lonesome Whistle Blow"--


and a very strange part of "Mystery Train" being played in Iraq while
contracftors are firing at citizens to cause chaos--the song is heard in the
back ground--

*Mystery Train Lyrics*


(words & music by h. parker - s. philips)
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well that long black train got my baby and gone

Train train, comin round, round the bend
Train train, comin round the bend
Well it took my baby, but it never will again (no, not again)

Train train, comin down, down the line
Train train, comin down the line
Well its bringin my baby, cause shes mine all, all mine
(shes mine, all, all mine)

"*Mystery Train*" is a song written by Junior
Parkerand Sam
Phillips . It was first recorded
in Phillip's Memphis Recording Service and Sun
Recordsat 706 Union Avenue,
Memphis, Tennessee in 1953. Raymond Hill and Matt
Murphy were in the backing band with Bill Johnson on piano, Pat Hare on
guitar, and John Bowers on drums. The band was listed on the label as Little
Junior's Blue Flames . "Mystery
Train" and "Love My Baby" was released late in 1953 on Sun #192, and from
the beginning the sound and feel of "Train" gave Parker his first taste of
fame and name recognition.[1]

Elvis Presley 's version of
"Mystery Train" was first released on August 20, 1955 as the B-side of "I
Forgot to Remember to
Forget"
(Sun 223). It was again produced by Sam
Phillipsat Sun Studios, and
featured Presley on vocals and rhythm guitar, Scotty
Moore  on lead guitar and Bill
Black  on bass. RCA Victor
rereleased this recording in December of 1955 (#47-6357) after acquiring it
as part of a contract with
Presley.[2]This
version of the song peaked at #11 on the national Billboard Country
Chart.[3]


The song has lent its name to several other works:

   - *Mystery Train* was the name of a TV series that documented
   Presley's early career while he was at Sun.
   - *Mystery Train
   * is a 1989  dark comedy movie
   written and directed by
indie film
   director  Jim
Jarmusch
   .
   - *Mystery Train* is the title of a book (ISBN
0-452-27836-8)
   by Greil Marcus  on the
   early history of rock and roll
   .
   - *Mystery Train* has been covered by Bruce
Springsteenon many
occasions, most recently, during his 2006 Seeger Sessions Tour by
   combining Mystery Train's chorus with Cadillac
Ranchfrom the 1980
   River  album.
   - *Mystery Train* is the name of an eclectic radio program hosted by
   David Wiley on KFAI , Fresh Air
   Community Radio, in Minneapolis,
   Minnesota .[4]
   - Mystery Train is also the name of another very popular radio program
   on WJZF radio in Standish Maine USA, hosted by Bob Reichers. World wide
   broadcasts at www.wjzf.org

In early December of 2005, the US
Armyinitiated a probe on a video
which first appeared on the
Internet  showing contractors
in Iraqfiring at civilians while
Elvis'
*Mystery Train* is being played in the background. The video purports to
show the firing of automatic rifles shooting into traffic, causing civilian
vehicles to swerve and crash on the dusty West Baghdad roads.

THEORY OF THEIRS


Things no longer split, discrete; they fissure, substance. From one side
to another, the same - I might declare | as any side, but what?
Disappearance (as a result) of any distinction, virtual wanderings among
virtual wanderings. This sweep ANNIHILATES US, lineages forget THE NAMING
OF THE DINOSAURS. Now what are left are EYES and for the purposing of
eyes. CONCRETELY the incandescent world, CONCRETELY information corrodes,
dissipates, from within. ALWAYS FROM WITHIN. And always NOW and HERE.:OUR
BODY SKINS ARE BORROWED, nothing less than churned wheelings dig into
momentary gravity. WHEN GALAXIES COLLIDE, life smears across the universe,
matter-energy returns, structure loses. Somewhere a thing knows
"INFORMATION is LOST" for that split peta-second before the tide. There
are no TEETH to the cosmos, only lassitude, languor, and enormous clangs
as sound screams through plasma. Here is my mark | and here | and here |
readied and lost before reading: that split which useless inscribes
simultaneously within erasure.:What was it I wanted to say? Oh yes, the
Large Attractor in the universe, once this is unaccounted-for, everything
is, we're lost in a cosmos, and if we CONCRETELY examine our lives thusly,
do we not forfeit everything? For in space and time we already are
virtual, non-existent, instinctual ghosts hungered for a token or mark of
indescribable PRESENCE.::<dissipation of time, naturally, DATA UNIVERSE
gone down

Come with me, Things no longer split, discrete; they fissure, substance.
From one side to another, the same - I might declare | as any side, but
what? Disappearance (as a result) of any distinction, virtual wanderings
among virtual wanderings. This sweep ANNIHILATES US, lineages forget THE
NAMING OF THE DINOSAURS. Now what are left are EYES and for the purposing
of eyes. CONCRETELY the incandescent world, CONCRETELY information
corrodes, dissipates, from within. ALWAYS FROM WITHIN. And always NOW and
HERE., beautiful wetware!

I love these feelings, What was it I wanted to say? Oh yes, the Large
Attractor in the universe, once this is unaccounted-for, everything is,
we're lost in a cosmos, and if we CONCRETELY examine our lives thusly, do
we not forfeit everything? For in space and time we already are virtual,
non-existent, instinctual ghosts hungered for a token or mark of
indescribable PRESENCE. ... Driven by drive-letters, gone world junkie ...

BONFIRE PRESS is pleased to announce the publication
of The Maximum
by Sarah Campbell

Description: Chapbook. 40 pages. 5 1/2 x 5 1/2 inches.
(2008). Edition
 of 80 copies. $7

"Just read--a first real read--The Maximum and think
it is everything I am currently searching and hoping
for in poetry: how a two-word poem, "Some Day," holds
such worlds of feeling times thought condensed...this
is the seashell Valéry talks about: the gradual and
mysterious formation of six letters, sieved out of
turbulence--stolen clarities amidst so much junk
subjectivity that is living. I agree with minimalism's
maximal intensities. Especially in our current
languo-saturated straits, these are as perfect as
poems come."

**Dream Bitches
http://www.dreambitches.org/
http://www.myspace.com/dreambitches
=20
After a debut record that merely hinted at the cacophonous pop sound of =B990=
s
bands like The Breeders and The Muffs, NYC=B9s Dream Bitches plunge in
head-first on their sophomore LP, Coke-and-Spiriters, out on Recommended If
You Like Records this March.
=20
The band, co-fronted by Yoko Kikuchi and Ann Zakaluk, formed back in the
fall of 2003, when the two long-time friends and musical collaborators took
a drive to Atlantic City and watched a bucket of quarters pour from the
mouth of a slot machine. They'd struck it rich! The first Dream Bitches son=
g
was born, as was the band.
=20
The two quickly found themselves playing all over New York, performing as a
duo. Guitarist Casey Holford joined the fray just before the band recorded
their 2005 debut, Sanfransisters, a playful folk-pop affair with jangly
acoustic guitars and catchy choruses that made Dream Bitches an East Villag=
e
cult sensation. To realize the full-band sound of the record, bassist Julie
DeLano and drummer Jen.Knee were recruited to complete the lineup.
=20
After two years as a five piece, the band naturally rocks harder and louder=
,
and so does its sophomore record. Coke-and-Spiriters captures the band at
their most volatile, featuring 10 tracks of distorted rock hooks and
hyper-literate acoustic ballads. Snarling anthems like "Maniacal Mechanic"
and "Bad Luck Bill" lend a new spirit of rock =B9n=B9 roll bombast to the
relentlessly wordy lyrics that make Kikuchi a classic antifolk songwriter i=
n
the tradition of Rough Trade=B9s Jeffrey Lewis and K Records=B9 Kimya Dawson.
Coke-and-Spiriters was recorded by Mark Ospovat of Emandee Studios
(CocoRosie, Wooden Wand, Jeff Lewis) and produced by Casey Holford (Cheese
on Bread, Daouets). After the release of the album, Dream Bitches will play
select dates throughout the United States.

**Serena Jost
http://www.myspace.com/serenajost
http://www.serenamusic.com
=20
Serena Jost is a Swiss-American singer/songwriter and cellist living in New
York City. Her forthcoming record, Closer Than Far, was produced by Brad
Albetta (Martha Wainwright, Teddy Thompson) and mixed at Monkeyboy Studios
in NYC. This stunning debut features Serena singing and playing guitar,
cello, and piano. Some of NYC=B9s tastiest musicians help to bring these
remarkable songs to life, which =B3seamlessly merge classical and pop
melodies=B2. (Lucidculture) Closer Than Far will be released at Joe=B9s Pub on
March 3rd, 2008.
=20
Serena has performed at seminal NYC venues such as The Living Room, Barbes,
Joe=B9s Pub, Tonic, Banjo Jim=B9s, Pete=B9s Candy Store, The Bowery Poetry Club,
The Kitchen and St. Mark=B9s Church. She is an original member of Rasputina,
the well-corseted cello group, and has collaborated with numerous other
artists including poet Dan Machlin (=B3Above Islands=B2 on Immanent Audio), and
has toured the United States and Europe extensively.
=20

**Robert Kerr
=20
Robert Kerr is a playwright and songwriter living in Brooklyn. He wrote the
book and lyrics for the short musical The Sticky-Fingered Fianc=E9e, and the
songs for his plays Kingdom Gone and Meet Uncle Casper, as well as his
Brothers Grimm adaptations Bearskin and The Juniper Tree. He was a founding
member of the Minneapolis band Alien Detector.
=20

**Chris Maher
http://www.myspace.com/chrismaher
http://www.chrismaher.net
=20
(pronounced mar): A young songwriter from New York City, wise beyond his
years and schooled below his wisdom, proud and protective of the tricks up
his sleeve. His music is oft an exercise in contradiction: Neurotic and
savvy, country and city, wry and idealistic. He=B9s a deft adjuster but his
fear of pigeonholes has been his pitfall=8Bto date, he has only two =B3released=
=B2
songs to his credit.
=20
This is, perhaps, because Chris has always felt most comfortable on the
fence, never willing to confine himself to any one musical community. Back
in the early 2000s, when first crashing the Lower East Side=B9s
love-it-or-detest-it Antifolk scene, Chris was also playing bass for hip-ho=
p
band Automato (Dim Mak/Capitol) as they were writing their DFA-produced
debut=8Bwhat else to do when Woody Guthrie and Wu-Tang Clan make equal sense.
=20
New York=B9s Recommended If You Like Records released the first of two
commercially available Maher-penned songs, =B3Summer Song,=B2 in 2004. It=B9s the
A-side of the debut release by The Morningsides, a two-song, 7-inch single
recorded by Walter Martin of The Walkmen. The single received considerable
praise and generous college radio airplay, but the band fractured before
committing anything else to tape. It wasn=B9t until late 2005 that Chris=B9
first =B3solo=B2 release, an early version of his =B3Ungrown Flowers=B2=8Bappeared on
Seattle label Baskerville Hill=B9s 2005 compilation Dr. Rhinocerous or, How I
Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Charge.
=20
Chris has previewed countless other compositions in various places: On the
radio (in both the U.S. and the U.K.), via the Internet and during his
frequent live shows. One song, =B3Pretty Smile,=B2 made its debut in the short
film, Rewind, by German filmmaker Joerg Steineck. Since 2006, Chris has
spent considerable time on the road, touring throughout the United States
and Europe. He has shared bills with a smorgasbord of fellow songwriters
such as M. Ward (Merge / 4AD), Mike Doughty (ATO), Kimya Dawson (K), Nellie
McKay (Columbia / Hungry Mouse), and Jeffrey Lewis (Rough Trade). He has
also appeared, as a singer and a multi-instrumentalist, on a number of othe=
r
peoples=B9 albums, including Throw Me the Statue=B9s Moonbeams (Secretly
Canadian / Baskerville Hill), Jack Lewis=B9 Lvov Goes to Emandee (Smoking
Gun), Huggabroomstik=B9s Ultimate Huggabroomstik (Luv-A-Lot), and Phoebe
Kreutz's Big Lousy Moon (self-released).
=20
Now, at long last, Recommended If You Like Records is gearing up to release
Chris=B9 debut long-player, Epigram on the Death of a Feeling. The 10-song
collection recalls the verbose bitterness of Leonard Cohen=B9s Songs of Love
and Hate and the restrained tenderness of early Wilco as well as Paul
Westerberg=B9s aggressive melodicism. Recorded primarily in Williamsburg,
Brooklyn with Mark Ospovat (Wooden Wand, Dufus), the album features an
assortment of Chris=B9 past and present musical comrades. Soon after the
record=B9s release, Chris will embark on full-scale tours of the U.S.A. and
Europe.

FM folk on the kitchen radio, new wave vinyl from the living room, punk roc=
k
tapes on the basement boombox=8Bthese are the ancestral sounds of Outlines, a
family indie rock affair. The band brings together the talents of Holford
brothers Casey (Urban Barnyard) and Matt (Darediablo) on guitar and
keyboards, cousin Wes Stannard (No Man=3DNo Eyes) on bass, and godfather Daou=
d
Tyler-Ameen (Art Sorority for Girls) on drums.

truffles with Cat Stevens blaring through his iPod, Poton (aka Adam Richard
Rudolf Ferretti) sits around in his hometown Staten Island abode crafting
songs about Zombies, not so endangered animals and the end of time, but
never ever love.=B2

Born and raised in South Florida, Preston Spurlock has been making lo-fi
bedroom records for eight years. He started making a name for himself in th=
e
NYC arts community in 2004, performing solo as The Sewing Circle, as well a=
s
in groups including the Elastic No-No Band and Huggabroomstik. Influenced
equally by postpunk, bluegrass, avant-garde composition, and novelty music,
Preston=B9s rough-hewn songs are idiosyncratic and intimate. He=B9s also a

**The Leader
http://myspace.com/theleadernyc

The Leader rock out with the dynamic grace of two sonic gymnasts. Careening
through a thousand time signatures and pop genres, bassist Julie DeLano and
drummer Sam Lazzara reign supreme over the low end, with suspenseful
rhythmic patterns beneath wickedly clever melodies and lyrics. It would be
math rock if it weren't so soulful.

Started as a solo recording project for no better reason than that he could=

Todd realized that the songs he wrote on the spot in the studio were turnin=

out too good not to play out, and so he assembled The Clamour as his backin=

Hi all,

Just wanted to pop in and introduce myself.  I'm a poet, published
author, photographer, artist living outside Austin, TX.  I've
recently had my first poem published and am busy getting a small
chapbook collection together hopefully to be published late this
year.   I'd like to somehow combine my photos and poems together.

I've heard that this group is friendly towards DIY and
self-publishing, so that's why I'm here....to see the "other side" of
the poetry world.  I have a long history of small press and
self-pubbed work, so I'm anxious to see what else is out there.

This list comes highly recommended; I'm glad to be here!

Happy trails,

bobbi c.

Not too forget:

How Long, How Long Blues blues (Leroy Carr)
" How long, how long, has that evenin' train been gone?
How long, how long, baby how long.
Heard the whistle blowin', couldn't see the train
Way down in my heart I had an achin' pain.
How long, how long, how long.
If I could holler like a mountain jack
I'd go up on the mountain and call my baby back.
I went up on the mountain, looked as far as I could see
The man had my woman and the blues had poor me.
I can see the green grass growin' on the hill
But I ain't seen the green grass on a dollar bill.
I'm goin' down to Georgia, been up in Tennessee
So look me over baby, last you'll see of me.
The brook runs into the river, river runs into the sea
If I don't run into my baby, a train is goin' to run into me.

- Peter

Hi all,

I am trying my hand at translating, but I'm having a hell of a time finding
a super-contemporary (as in, a poet that has had only one or two books out,
is still in 30's or 40's) French poet to translate. It's difficult to google
for French poets (in French, of course), as (much like when you google
"American poets") lots of pages about  19th & early 20th century poets come
up, but not much that seems anywhere near as contemporary as I want to be,
even when I include the word "contemporary" in the search. My goal is to
find a very interesting, very contemporary poet & create a translation
relationship with the poet, but I'm having trouble. This is probably partly
because my French is not exactly amazing. I had hoped to study for a few
months (to brush up from my four-year study as an undergrad) and then begin
translating, but I now feel I'd better begin translating now and use that as
way to both begin a new writing project and improve vocab (which is my
primary weakness). I think that if I knew major French publishers or even
major French online bookstores, this would be a lot easier, but I just don't
know those things and I'm not exactly sure how to go about looking.

So, all of that to say, does anybody know of a source to find
super-contemporary French poetry? I'm interested in anything--online
journals, online bookstores, publishers, individual poets' pages, etc. And,
even better, does anybody know any super-contemporary french poets doing
OULIPO or experimental-formal poetry? I think if I could just find a key in,
I could find somebody who catches my fancy.

Thanks for any and all help.

Hi Lititia,

  If you go to www.amazon.fr and search "poemes contemporains," "poesie contemporaine," and the like, you should be able to find something. A similar search on google would probably be helpful, too.

journals, online bookstores, publishers, individual poets' pages, etc. And,
even better, does anybody know any super-contemporary french poets doing
OULIPO or experimental-formal poetry? I think if I could just find a key in,
I could find somebody who catches my fancy.

Thanks for any and all help.

Hello again,

  I just tried the amazon.fr search, and if you select one of the anthologies, there's a "Rechercher des articles similaires par thème" heading where you can choose from both "Poésie francophone - 20e siècle - Anthologies" and "Poésie française - 20e siècle - Anthologies," depending on whether you want to stay on French soil or not.

  Good luck!

  David

  Hi all,

I am trying my hand at translating, but I'm having a hell of a time finding
a super-contemporary (as in, a poet that has had only one or two books out,
is still in 30's or 40's) French poet to translate. It's difficult to google
for French poets (in French, of course), as (much like when you google
"American poets") lots of pages about 19th & early 20th century poets come
up, but not much that seems anywhere near as contemporary as I want to be,
even when I include the word "contemporary" in the search. My goal is to
find a very interesting, very contemporary poet & create a translation
relationship with the poet, but I'm having trouble. This is probably partly
because my French is not exactly amazing. I had hoped to study for a few
months (to brush up from my four-year study as an undergrad) and then begin
translating, but I now feel I'd better begin translating now and use that as
way to both begin a new writing project and improve vocab (which is my
primary weakness). I think that if I knew major French publishers or even
major French online bookstores, this would be a lot easier, but I just don't
know those things and I'm not exactly sure how to go about looking.

IAre you near a major library? If so, check through their holdings.
But if you've never translated before it might be wiser to start with
something a bit easier to translate. Language games in one language
almost never translate into language games in another.

I'm pleased to announce two new books from Krupskaya Press, one by George
Albon, one by Colin Smith.

They're available through Small Press Distribution.  I know you will enjoy
them, just give them a chance!

Kevin Killian (San Francisco)

TITLE 1:
Momentary Songs
George Albon
ISBN 978-1-92865-027-0
$14
94 pages
perfect bound


A moment is an inside flutter, a reflection, a civil relapse.  George
Albon's Momentary Songs sound the possibilities of forwardness and hope in
a surrounding twilight of unprecedented venality.  Using a variety of
registerss--llyrical inquiry, Blakean exhortation, the satirical spiel of
Morgenstern’s Gallows Songs--they search for alternative states (public
ones, affective ones) as well as offer a probe on what has come to pass:
"In this eclipse are we the inclement for placing it?"

A reading pole can also be a door, a tree trunk, the wall of a barn.  It's
the itinerant's edge-of-town bulletin board, where shared message-symbols
are drawn and heeded: Good town, bad town, okay place to stay, don't stop
here.  The poems of Reading Pole both comment on and embody the heart of
these messages: quick news on the open-ended route.

In Dorothea Tanning's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, an enormous sunflower lays
across an upper floor landing.  A pubescent girl with undone blouse leans
against the landing's wall, enduring an experience, or savoring one.
Another girl, her back to the viewer, looks down the hallway, her long
tresses freed from gravity and tendriling toward the ceiling.  Sunflowers
will do that.

Seven Admissions offer variations on a name, and revel in the world
between the letters. Inspired by Frank O'Hara's crostic-poems to Edwin
Denby, these admissions are playful and austere by turns, but always
putting forth Eros as challenge to the death-making predicates of the
title sequence.


Of Momentary Songs, Rodney Koeneke writes:

"Avuncular spotted drones," be warned.  Not since Guston did Nixon has the
resource of art been turned on the throne with such hopeful scurrility.
Albon's Momentary Songs are hymns for the unchurched "pioneers/of the
bottom edge,” who know "midnights are false" and want back their stars.
I'm taking my news from the other George: resistance isn't futile, it's
the "sunlight is information" age and Minerva’s owl sings "coup due."
Rodney Koeneke

And here is Taylor Brady weighing in:
One might echo Walter Benjamin on Karl Kraus: "The very term 'public
opinion' outrages him.  Opinions are a private matter.  The public has an
interest only in judgments."  The title sequence of Albon's tough and
tensile new collection, Momentary Songs, might surprise readers accustomed
to the quiet, deliberate insistence with which his work has gathered
itself into place over the years.  This is an Albon committed to the
clamor of a public occasion, revealing how large has been the imagination
guiding his work all along, had we only listened.  Albon takes up Kraus's
struggle (minus, thankfully, its flirtation with reaction) within a
horizon of "opinion" immeasurably broadened, as our current machines of
public chatter threaten to level discourse as a whole into information,
and pulverize that information into noise.  Not content to retreat from
this scene into the contemplative chambers in which the business of our
politics consoles itself, neither do these lyrics adopt the fashionable
stance which would hope to overcome the stultifying noise by amplifying it
back to itself in a feedback loop of hip futility.  What's at work--and
what works--here, is a granular method locating edges of articulation
among the turns of phrase of our shared unconsciousness, recovering
Albon's larger project of the deliberate by bringing words to their moment
of deliberation--often in startling outbursts of rhyme, in which are felt
a deep historical current of poetry as that which refuses simply to
inform, but must sound.  Kraus: "How noisy everything grows."  Albon: "But
that was not a document, just a temporary air disturbance."

Count Out Loud (lyric& press), Brief Capital of Disturbances (Omnidawn),

Francisco.


TITLE 2:
8x8x7
Colin Smith
ISBN 978-1-92865-028-7
$14
89 pages
perfect bound


8 x 8 x 7 finds the Winnipeg-based poet Colin Smith in panopticon mode,
his eye everywhere, glittering and shifting planes like a human
kaleidoscope.  Even those who have followed Smith’s career since his term
in Vancouver’s estimable Kootenay School of Writing, and his previous book
Multiple Poses (Tsunami Editions, 1997) may not be prepared for the
intensity of feeling now so thoroughly mashed up with his vaunted
multiplicity.  After a blistering, acid-laced opening salvo, ironically
titled "Just," Smith builds up the attack through a series of escalating
feints and rhapsodies.  His targets include war, unemployment, sexual
category, the talking heads of TV and continental philosophy, outsourcing,
liberal piety and, most touchingly, his own body, once a source of comfort
and strength, now a font of lacerating pain.  No two poems in his book are
alike, but they surround an uncommon fire.  After a touching finale,
"Codicil," a sort of coda, "Goodbye (Riddance)," puts us right back on the
block again.  What is 8 x 8 x 7 anyhow?  At first you might think it’s a
toaster; now then maybe not.  You're in this condition of doubt
recommended by the poet, whose title poem points to a place from which we
might retrace our misguided steps: "'I don't know' is a good start."

Of 8 x 8 x 7, Donato Mancini has this to say:
Colin Smith is in curious pain, and he wants to know the source.  So he
feels around for clues with his mother-tongue baby id in the "sharps"
dumpster of language, disenjoying the plenitude of positive results.
There's always already an avalanche of data, as any ingenious cottage
linguist pointing to social relations as materialized in language will
show-not-tell you.  Colin is "subject to," like every other thumbsucker,
but doesn't mistakenly think God/Dad or the ghosts have it out for him.
Why would a statistic think that way?  Back pain is structural, specific
and symptomatic.  Pain is all the more real (therefore: combatable) when
it's understood as the improperty of the unhappy masses.  Woe is me, me is
us.  Colin Smith's meticulously foul temper, unfed greed for answers, rage
against the condom dispenser in cancerously funny poetry is as specific as
"it" gets. To be made an example of.

I think there might be some under-40 French poets (as well as some older
ones, and some deceased ones) in this issue of the Germ from earlier this
decade.

Subject:      "Ho-Ochs" a homophone of "Hoax"//Agit-Prop Trains/Torture Song
              List & "Is Poetry a War Crime?"/from trains to training-
MIME-Version: 1.0

Looking at the subject header that included "Ho-Ochs"--i suddenly realized a
whole new homophone is created --for--a subject of late found here--"Hoax"
and fakes--(echoing an article abt the Fake Indian  bestselling new Age
writer Nasdijj called "Navahoax"--)

Music, songs and poetry have  long been understood as weapons in many
different ways.  "The pen is mightier than the sword," and "Joshua fi't the
Battle of Jericho/and the Walls came tumblin down" come to mind.  (Burroughs
in interviews at one point spoke a lot of the Army's development of a
machine that would produce low level sound waves that gradually vibrate
walls into collapsing.)

Words and music as weapons are turning up in may different ways--from
propaganda to torture to War Crimes--

These  "words/music as weapons" in the propaganda sense were combined with
trains in the creation of "agit-prop" trains that were widely used in the
then new Soviet Union and are documented in many of the Kino-Pravda films of
Dziga Vertov.  (One of the greatest to this day  cinemamatic visual poetries
is his Man with a Movie Camera.)

A very interesting and good book that deals a lot with poetry and politics
is Mayakovsky's "How Are Verses Made."  (It was written as part of a
practical series for the use of the new Societ citizenzry, which included  a
great many other "How are they made?" primers:  "How are Shoes Made?"  "How
are Ships Made?" and so on--


While Mayakovsky was not a politician per se, he worked tirelessly as a PR
person for the New Society, creating agti-prop for trains sent throughout
the Soviet Republics, jingles for the MOSCOM and GUM State stores, radio
plays, poetry, song lyrics, book covers, an endless stream of works for the
new Society and for a new approach and use of language to accompany,
express, influence and promote it. Mayakovsky was as far as I know the first
poet to have his words up in lights.  He had originally been a painting
student, and visuality is always very present in al his works, along with a
great sense of amplification--"At the Top of My Voice" as an early Futurist
poem announces, is his preferred mode of address.  He used megaphones and
microphones with agit prop trains and huge outdoors events, the radio, the
cinema, the designing of advertisements to go up on lights for State
businesses, and he tirelessly designed and produced wall newspapers,
posters, and banners.

Beginning with the Futurist Opera "Victory over the Sun" (1913; it included
the first Suprematist works by Malevich used for the sets ) Mayakovsky
collaborated with a great many musicians, visual artists, musicians, sound
engineers--and train engineers-- and cinematographers. Ironically, part of
the argument in "How Are Verses Made" is to be very much against the poetry
and example of Esenin, who had recently committed suicide.  It was not all
that long after writingt the book that Mayakovsky himself became a suicide.)


In an Italian Futurist vein of trains of association one arrives at
"training" used in "War, the world's hygiene" (Marinetti, Futurist
Manifesto, 1909).

Train songs become "training" songs used by torturers to discipline the
victims into the desired states of terror and helplessness, the "softening
up" preparations for what is yet to come.

Mother Jones in its February issue has a list of the most recent "favorites"
, which I'v supplemented with some older listings.

re "Is Poetry a War Crime?"--

considered as a form of "agit-prop" in a sense--is it? if it develops from
propaganda say into the direct advocacy and incitement to ethnic
cleansing?--

Was Pound's poetry perhaps also possible to be included in this aspect, or
simply the radio broadcast speeches? (it seems basically the latter is what
was agreed upon, for legal purposes of the time at any rate.)

The consideration of this question has been raised during the current era,
when music is being used for torture--why not poetry also be considered in
some extreme cases a weapon of War Crimes--

There was a  NY Times Magazine article a week ago about Edward Liminov, the
Russian poet and novelist,  1970's punk American emigre and 1980's French
literary  star turned 1990's extreme Russian Nationalist/Fascist and now, in
the  Times' cheery view, "Putin's Pariah."  In other words, once again a
sort of "friend of ours.

Limonov's turn to extreme Nationalism and association with right wingers
like Zhirinovksy parallel that of another poet--and psychiatrist--Radovan
Karadzic.  In many accounts, both men, especially Karadzic, seemed to morph
almost overnight into totally different creatures than they had appeared to
be  just a very short time previous.

Not surprisingly,  the Ulta-Nationalist Limonov paid a visit to Karadzic
during the siege of Sarajevo. A video used at Karadzic's War Crimes
Tribunals shows the two "warrior poets"  firing at the city's citizens after
the Serbian leader has recited one of his blood-curdling poems.

Using this among a great deal of other evidence, Jay Surdukowksi, at the
time  (2005) a
Law Clerk - of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, has written a very
interesting brief that argues for the legality under international law of
using poetry as a form of evidence in the commission  of War crimes. It was
originally published in the Michigan Journal of International Law, Vol 28,
No 673, Winter 2005, and I've included a link for it below.

THE TORTURERS TOP TUNES SONG LISTS

Mother Jones has published in  their last issue (Feb '08) a list of songs
used during torture sessions.  I've also included some older "playlists"
back to the "oldies" used against the trapped American Ally suddenly turned
enemy "voodoo practicing dope fiend" General Manuel Noreiga.  (Hence "Voodoo
Child" by Hendrix among others played for him.)  Similar mind shattering
blasts were directed at the Koresh Compound at Waco.

So far the only two countries I've found who officially use this technique
are USA and Israel.

THE TORTURERS TOP TUNES SONG LISTS

The songs choices, besides the  Heavy Metal/Black Satanic Metal and Gansta
Rap  mega-decibel level also include the "heavily Patriotic" songs like
"Born in the USA" and "American Pie"  along with "Barney"  and a lot of
other "infantile" songs, the infantile-regressed stage one that  the
torturers hope to send the victims back to increase the levels of fear and
helplessness.

hERE'S THE MOST RECENT LISTING, FROM THE fEBRUARY iSSUE OF mOTHER jONES
jOURNAL:

"The tracks have all been played by guards and interrogators in inducing
sleep deprivation, "prolonging capture shock," disorienting detainees during
interrogations, and/or drowning out screams. The "Torture Playlist" is based
on a leaked interrogation log, news reports, and on info from soldiers and
detainees.

Two American poets, Stacy Doris and Chet Weiner work with some really
wild contemporary French stuff. Last heard they were hiding away in
Cypress but I think they can still be contacted via San Francisco
State.

Hi everyone,

I'll be reading with Marie Carter, author of The Trapeze Diaries

on Sunday, March 23rd at 6 pm.  The Cornelia Street Cafe is located
at  29 Cornelia Street between Bleecker Street and W 4 Street.  I

Subject:      Frontier (completed, on monothers, avatars, others, bothers)
MIME-Version: 1.0

Frontier (completed, on monothers, avatars, others, bothers)


I like to believe I'm working on a frontier and all I can tell you is
what's on the normative side of things; the rest is yet to be seen,
unabsorbed. Once brought in from the Pale, it's of lesser interest, but
beyond the Pale there's nothing but the agony of shadows. Defuge takes
over and the frontier, always an imaginary, shudders and reconvenes.

The videos/choreographies exist between human and human - someone was
there making the original files with motion capture, and someone is at the
other end, watching and using them once again. The virtual is a shadow of
the real, the real is a shadow of the virtual, and within the true world
superimpositions, gestures, and the fading of ontologies characterize what
remains of the fixity of inscriptive practices of the classical and modern
ages.

Distinctions are blurred through embedding and filtering. Avatars and
humans - together, emanents - are embedded in online virtual worlds, in
spaces which are simultaneously physical/inert/analog and virtual/mobile/
digital. Every seeing, every being, is a filtering; existence and copula
are interwoven. A current collection of texts is called Messays; in a
Messay, there's no leading sentence, no orderly sequence of ideas, no
summings-up, no conclusions. The essay is to classical narratology as the
messay is to future true world genres which seep into one another, head-
less and tailless - meandering on the one hand, problematic obeisance to
protocols on the other.

What we started with is the body which is inscribed with scars, scratches,
tears, wounds, blemishes, abrasions, cuts, and all other debris carrying
analogic history into the symbolic. What we continued with are tattoos,
incisions, fashion, gesture, languagings, and what continually emerges is
the body harboring technology as self retreats or withdraws, puckers, from
the wild symphonics of externally-applied filters digging ever deeper.

The walk or arm-swing becomes gesture becomes anysign becomes trade-off,
translation, transformation, exchange, interoperability, reified territor-
ialization. One sits at a console and breathes through sheave-skin,
another begins vortex stage-center with flesh-electric, a third wanders
memory of others airless, unbreathing, peripheral wanderings mediated at
mind's back. From the airless, flesh-breathers are attracted, gather,
project and introject, their selves flowing, flooding, abjecting, full of
scent and coagulation.

We take our tiny community of people up and down mountains, in and out of
clubs and iced fields, across the chiasm of cut bodies and body cuts,
mines and other extractive industries across the flesh of land and bodies.
What we bring back is always new, even if only in the slightest detail, a
brush of the hand or turn of the head that was never seen before. And we
keep to our goal of understanding filtering and embedding better than
before, and understanding bodies in the always future anterior world, the
true world of emanents and anysign where we're living, breathing, writing
and wryting, this and any future day.

Almost every avatar you see represented is a composite of two people; if
you see two avatars engaged with one another, the engagement is contiguous
at best, and each avatar is itself a composite. The composites are male
and female; they reflect and murmur other in relation. Two are four, four
are eight, eight are sixteen. Or more, depending on the configuration of
motion-capture, the independence of minds and intentions.

Laplanche and Pontalis, The Language of Psychoanalysis, the Imaginary:

"In the sense given to this term by Jacques Lacan (and generally used
substantively); one of the three essential orders of the psycho-analytic
field" [...]

[...] "Lacan brought forward the idea that the ego of the human infant -
as a result, in particular, of its biological prematurity - is constituted
on the basis of the image of the counterpart (specular ego).

Bearing in mind this primordial experience: we may categorize the
following as falling  into the Imaginary:

a. from the intrasubjective point of view, the basically narcissistic
relation of the subject to his ego;

b. from the intersubjective point of view, a so-called _dual_ relationship
based on - and captured by - the image of a counterpart (erotic attrac-
tion, aggressive tension). For Lacan, a counterpart (i.e. another who is
me) can only exist by virtue of the fact that the ego is originally
another." [...]

Thus simultaneously a space of mirroring and of singular constitution, a
space of a real and an evanescence. In Second Life, objects are
constituted in relation to a well-ordered data-base, without which the
enumeration of potential behaviors, constructions, and wanderings would
be impossible.

"another who is me" - another always is me, neither constitutive nor part-
and-parcel. One leaps on the page to "Incorporation": "Process whereby the
subject, more or less on the level of phantasy, has an object penetrate
his body and keeps it 'inside' his body." Etc. etc., more or less. One
might argue that it is always incorporation, that the world is world by
virtue of _devouring._ I would ask, who pulls the strings, moves the
sensors, whereby one has been two, two murmur one, in these image of
behaviors that are simultaneously inconceivable, and at the root of every
narrative?

It doesn't stop there; the avatars are the result of filtered behavior,
filtered in such a way that f(n) does not equal 1, i.e. is not trans-
parent, but in fact transforms behavior into caricature that gnaws at the
body, representative and within a primordial gnawing, if you like. (This
filtering occurs in the transmission/reception stage of raw sensor data
turning towards coherent representation. Filtering is mobile, perhaps
system noise, more likely hacking or rupture, the dim imaging of presence
unaccounted-for. Any reception is filtered - I'm arguing for yet another
stage in the communications model, existing in those liminal interfaces
among block-diagram entities and arrows.)

Table 5, Eco's theory of codes in A Theory of Semiotics - the Watergate
(hydraulic) Model interpreted in relation to expression and content
planes. But framed on the left: "Continuum / Light, electric phenomena /
Non-semiotic matter" and on the right: "Continuum / the unshaped continuum
of the position of the water along with everything one can think about it
/ Non-semiotic matter." One discretely cuts surgically within the analogic
which remains impervious, bounding; a discrete cut cuts discretely, con-
structs difference across fissure, that is operates within and constructs
inscription. Isn't the world such an inscription? Let us think of non-
semiotic matter as _dark matter_ to be brought within the fold (pli).

Selves are located, others and an others are located, between these mat-
ters, which are all that matter, out of which the drawing-forth is tempor-
ary at best. Nagarjuna has no position and this positionlessness is as
close as one can get.

The doubled figures within the figures of the avatars you see projected on
the screen, live or in careful reproduction, are uncanny; they appear in
documentary footage to be completely independent, but by virtue of the
sensors are connected, as in Bell's theorem, in such a manner as a frac-
tured _monother_ or entity is produced. Conflicting forces are combined
without effect or affect traveling among them: there is no resolution,
only tearings as the image-monother accommodates them all. Think of the
movements as _catatonic sex-dances_ or rites of passage held in position
precisely by those noisy channels which, parasitic, spew culture in other-
wise dull transmissions. A catatonic sex-dance is a molding or ingestion,
incorporations, of others in order to form selves (an 'adult' is an entity
whose flesh is carved into the semblance of a human being). A dance is
called 'sex-dance' if it is dual; it is also 'corporation-dance,' 'money-
dance,' 'incorporation-dance,' 'culture-dance,' 'death-dance.' Sheave-
skins generate nothing internally but imaginaries; externally, they
generate internals. Think of the monother as worlding, the mapping of
external universes onto, within, small finite spaces which appear coher-
ent, the mapping cohering. The dance, like that of bees, is of course any
communication, established or not, channeled or not; one might think of
beings inhabiting monothers in such a way that their touch is full,
replete, of one another. What you see on the screen may appear both tired
and strange, but it is also a model of the true world within which
monothers characterize life and lives, living, inhabitations, habitus.
(Think of the 'it' in 'one going it alone.')

You have to look for the specific discrete levels, nodes, configurations,
on the expression plane - all of which are moving at high-speed - but you
_must_ look, drawing forth a narrative, which, like all others, is yours
and yours alone and ties, however uncomfortably, the appearance of beings
into Being. You have to see monothers shimmering among modes of existence,
ontologies, for example, movements among rocks and cliffs and movements
among intended rocks and cliffs, deferring among intentional/configured
ontologies, and those which are mute, inert, idiotic. Or divide the cata-
tonic sex-dance into substance-catatonia (misnomer and oxymoron to boot)
and inscription-sex-dance (the same, the other boot, terms booting mono-
thers into the arena).

Now you're getting closer to the relationship among inscription, code,
substance, communication, &tc, and further might bring you permanently,
like a matchmaker.com, into collusion from collocation, where contiguity
and contingency meld and something permanently unnameable emerges, where
Nagarjuna's grasping, samsara, appears:

" When there is a grasping, the grasper
   Comes into existence.
   If he did not grasp,
   Then being freed, he would not come into existence. "

(The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way, Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakar-
ika, translation and commentary Jay L. Garfield.)

Let them go at that.

Hi David and Mark, thanks for the comments.
David, I have tried searching as you suggest. The trouble is, as if one
searched in English, "contemporary" means pretty much anything from 1950
until now to many people, so I'm getting stuff I am already very familiar
with and that has already been translated. But I will definitely try Amazon.
Perhaps I'll fare better there.

Mark, I live in a tiny town in Vermont, so I don't actually live near a
major library. Our library has a good selection of US poets (for a small
library), and even that isn't really enough for me--no New York School
Poetry, no innovative poetry post 1980, etc. Our French poetry in French
selection is nil, except for a few Baudelaire & Rimbaud in parallel text.
I'm already pretty familiar with the tradition, so these aren't useful to me
anymore--I am now interested in people my age and slightly older, who I know
nothing about as a person living & reading in the US.

As for my translating experience, I have been spending some time with the
Paul Auster edited 20th century poetry anthology (which some people
mentioned in personal e-mails to me). I translated about twenty poems
without looking at the parallel text and found that I am basically on the
right track in terms of grammar & such. That, of course, is not the most
important part of translating, but I wanted to be sure that I was there
before I begin my own project in earnest.  I'm not interested in spending a
lot of time with poets who are not very contemporary (the youngest poet in
the 20th century book has to be well over 50), as they have already been
translated by many of the big translators of French poetry (Auster, the
Waldrops, etc.).

Thank you all for the comments, though! & I'm reminded to look at
Moroccan/other francophone country poets as well. No need to limit myself to
France.

Thanks,
LT

Guernica Editions, from Toronto, puts out many French works in translation.
Unfortunately, these are not bilingual editions. However, they recently
provided translations of both Denise Desautels and Louise Dupre, both of
whom are prominent Quebecois poets. There is also the Acadian poet tradition
from New Brunswick of whom Hermenegilde Chiasson is probably the most
prominent - considering he is the current Lieutenant Governor of the
province. Goose Lane Editions has recently put out his 'Beatitudes' in
English translation. There is a simultaneously released French edition
available although I do not know the publisher. A third Canadian source of
French-language poetry arises from the St. Boniface area of Winnipeg,
Manitoba although I am unfortunately unaware of whom I could refer you to
there - which is rather a sad state of affairs considering that I live in
Winnipeg. We're hoping to remedy that situation this fall by Contemporary
Verse 2 potentially creating a bilingual poetry reading series for which I
was volunteered by CV2's editor, Clarise Foster. Commendably, CV2 has
published poetry in French (particularly from St. Boniface poets) alongside
their otherwise English poetry. As far as I am aware, CV2 did make it a part
of their mandate to publish in both languages.

Dear readers:

Did you miss us? We missed you. It's only been a brief eon but the idiots
have taken over the world, and the internet is seducing us all into trading
in our brains for beads. Welcome back to the Post-Katrina Resurrection
Corpse, back from a dank hiatus of one year in a formaledehyde-poisoned FEMA
trailer. We festered, we raged, we contemplated suicide, and in the end,
voted for life because we are a Corpse already and we hate to keep on dying,
just like the ideals of the Republic. Our guest-editor for this issue is the
formidable poet, publisher, New Orleanian, and homme-du-monde-et-de-lettres,
Bill Lavender. Bill has ploughed through the accumulated debris in our
trailer, turning over towers of submissions and lovingly removing mold and
giving new lustre to tarnished but potent weapons of poesy, crit, and
story-time. We will continue to exalt, irritate, surprise, be loving,
merciless, and obscene, just like you. Our Bulgarian genius, Plamen
Arnaudov, has updated our technology so that the Corpse may flow
continually, with updates posted as quickly as the zeitgeist requires. We
also welcome Vincent Cellucci, poet and chef to Our Gang, so that we might
eat well while we tryst and plunder. Reader, please come back, visit, and,
most importantly, re- register to join our raiding parties, and ride with
the Resurrected Corpse. You don't need to bring your own horse to the
raiding parties because we are planning (secretly) to offer ship cruises to
our subscribers. (It costs nothing to subscribe). And let your list know
that the Corpse is back: http://www.corpse.org

 I've heard the Republicans use  "Born in the USA" during their wierd, somtimes Leni R Triumph of the Will rallies. Both parties have switched to Tom Petty songs as they're billboard safe. I haven't tought of a Harold Bloom kind of creative misreading as it applies to pep rallies, but dammit, it works.

Barry Schwabsky <b.schwabsky@BTOPENWORLD.COM> wrote:   Speaking of creative misreading, it's curious, isn't it, that "Born in the USA" has become a "heavily patriotic" song, given its lyrics:

He had a little girl in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms

Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years down the road
Nowhere to run, ain't got nowhere to go

Subject: "Ho-Ochs" a homophone of "Hoax"//Agit-Prop Trains/Torture Song List & "Is Poetry a War Crime?"/from trains to training-

Looking at the subject header that included "Ho-Ochs"--i suddenly realized a
whole new homophone is created --for--a subject of late found here--"Hoax"
and fakes--(echoing an article abt the Fake Indian bestselling new Age
writer Nasdijj called "Navahoax"--)

Music, songs and poetry have long been understood as weapons in many
different ways. "The pen is mightier than the sword," and "Joshua fi't the
Battle of Jericho/and the Walls came tumblin down" come to mind. (Burroughs
in interviews at one point spoke a lot of the Army's development of a
machine that would produce low level sound waves that gradually vibrate
walls into collapsing.)

Words and music as weapons are turning up in may different ways--from
propaganda to torture to War Crimes--

These "words/music as weapons" in the propaganda sense were combined with
trains in the creation of "agit-prop" trains that were widely used in the
then new Soviet Union and are documented in many of the Kino-Pravda films of
Dziga Vertov. (One of the greatest to this day cinemamatic visual poetries
is his Man with a Movie Camera.)

A very interesting and good book that deals a lot with poetry and politics
is Mayakovsky's "How Are Verses Made." (It was written as part of a
practical series for the use of the new Societ citizenzry, which included a
great many other "How are they made?" primers: "How are Shoes Made?" "How
are Ships Made?" and so on--


While Mayakovsky was not a politician per se, he worked tirelessly as a PR
person for the New Society, creating agti-prop for trains sent throughout
the Soviet Republics, jingles for the MOSCOM and GUM State stores, radio
plays, poetry, song lyrics, book covers, an endless stream of works for the
new Society and for a new approach and use of language to accompany,
express, influence and promote it. Mayakovsky was as far as I know the first
poet to have his words up in lights. He had originally been a painting
student, and visuality is always very present in al his works, along with a
great sense of amplification--"At the Top of My Voice" as an early Futurist
poem announces, is his preferred mode of address. He used megaphones and
microphones with agit prop trains and huge outdoors events, the radio, the
cinema, the designing of advertisements to go up on lights for State
businesses, and he tirelessly designed and produced wall newspapers,
posters, and banners.

Beginning with the Futurist Opera "Victory over the Sun" (1913; it included
the first Suprematist works by Malevich used for the sets ) Mayakovsky
collaborated with a great many musicians, visual artists, musicians, sound
engineers--and train engineers-- and cinematographers. Ironically, part of
the argument in "How Are Verses Made" is to be very much against the poetry
and example of Esenin, who had recently committed suicide. It was not all
that long after writingt the book that Mayakovsky himself became a suicide.)


In an Italian Futurist vein of trains of association one arrives at
"training" used in "War, the world's hygiene" (Marinetti, Futurist
Manifesto, 1909).

Train songs become "training" songs used by torturers to discipline the
victims into the desired states of terror and helplessness, the "softening
up" preparations for what is yet to come.

Mother Jones in its February issue has a list of the most recent "favorites"
, which I'v supplemented with some older listings.

re "Is Poetry a War Crime?"--

considered as a form of "agit-prop" in a sense--is it? if it develops from
propaganda say into the direct advocacy and incitement to ethnic
cleansing?--

Was Pound's poetry perhaps also possible to be included in this aspect, or
simply the radio broadcast speeches? (it seems basically the latter is what
was agreed upon, for legal purposes of the time at any rate.)

The consideration of this question has been raised during the current era,
when music is being used for torture--why not poetry also be considered in
some extreme cases a weapon of War Crimes--

There was a NY Times Magazine article a week ago about Edward Liminov, the
Russian poet and novelist, 1970's punk American emigre and 1980's French
literary star turned 1990's extreme Russian Nationalist/Fascist and now, in
the Times' cheery view, "Putin's Pariah." In other words, once again a
sort of "friend of ours.

Limonov's turn to extreme Nationalism and association with right wingers
like Zhirinovksy parallel that of another poet--and psychiatrist--Radovan
Karadzic. In many accounts, both men, especially Karadzic, seemed to morph
almost overnight into totally different creatures than they had appeared to
be just a very short time previous.

Not surprisingly, the Ulta-Nationalist Limonov paid a visit to Karadzic
during the siege of Sarajevo. A video used at Karadzic's War Crimes
Tribunals shows the two "warrior poets" firing at the city's citizens after
the Serbian leader has recited one of his blood-curdling poems.

Using this among a great deal of other evidence, Jay Surdukowksi, at the
time (2005) a
Law Clerk - of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, has written a very
interesting brief that argues for the legality under international law of
using poetry as a form of evidence in the commission of War crimes. It was
originally published in the Michigan Journal of International Law, Vol 28,
No 673, Winter 2005, and I've included a link for it below.

THE TORTURERS TOP TUNES SONG LISTS

Mother Jones has published in their last issue (Feb '08) a list of songs
used during torture sessions. I've also included some older "playlists"
back to the "oldies" used against the trapped American Ally suddenly turned
enemy "voodoo practicing dope fiend" General Manuel Noreiga. (Hence "Voodoo
Child" by Hendrix among others played for him.) Similar mind shattering
blasts were directed at the Koresh Compound at Waco.

So far the only two countries I've found who officially use this technique
are USA and Israel.

THE TORTURERS TOP TUNES SONG LISTS

The songs choices, besides the Heavy Metal/Black Satanic Metal and Gansta
Rap mega-decibel level also include the "heavily Patriotic" songs like
"Born in the USA" and "American Pie" along with "Barney" and a lot of
other "infantile" songs, the infantile-regressed stage one that the
torturers hope to send the victims back to increase the levels of fear and
helplessness.

hERE'S THE MOST RECENT LISTING, FROM THE fEBRUARY iSSUE OF mOTHER jONES
jOURNAL:

"The tracks have all been played by guards and interrogators in inducing
sleep deprivation, "prolonging capture shock," disorienting detainees during
interrogations, and/or drowning out screams. The "Torture Playlist" is based
on a leaked interrogation log, news reports, and on info from soldiers and
detainees.

Here's the list (in no particular order):
"Born in the USA" - Bruce Springsteen
"Shoot to Thrill" - AC/DC
"Die MF Die" - Dope
"Take Your Best Shot" - Dope
"White America" - Eminem

* *

*EXAMPLES AND INFO FROM wIKIPEDIA:
*

- Bombardment with loud music has been known to have been used in
other occasions

Manuel Noriega

"When the United States invaded Panama in December 1989, Noriega took refuge
in the Holy See's embassy which was immediately surrounded by U.S. troops.
After being continually bombarded by *hard rock music* and "The Howard Stern
Show" for several days, Noriega surrendered on Jan. 3,
1990.[4]
[5] "

Guantanamo

According to the
FBI[6]
[7]
:

"W[itness] observed sleep deprivation interviews w/strobe lights and *loud
music*. Interrogator said it would take 4 days to break someone doing an
interrogation 16 hrs w/lights and music on and 4 hrs off. Handwritten note
next to typed synopsis says *"ok under DoD policy"*.



"Rumors that interrogator bragged about doing lap dance on d[etainee],
another about making d[etainee] listen to *satanic black metal music* for
hours then dressing as a Priest and baptizing d[etainee] to save him -
handwritten note says 'yes'."



"W[itness] saw d[etainee] in interview room sitting on floor w/Israeli flag
draped around him, *loud music* and strobe lights. W suspects this practice
is used by DOD DHS based on who he saw in the hallway."

The *Washington Post *,
quoting a leaked Red Cross report,
wrote:[8]

"The physical tactics noted by the Red Cross included placing detainees in
extremely cold rooms with *loud music* blaring, and forcing them to kneel
for long periods of time, the source familiar with the report said."

Iraq

According to Amnesty
International
[9] :

"Detainees have reported being routinely subjected to cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment during arrest and detention. Many have told Amnesty
International that they were tortured and ill-treated by US and UK troops
during interrogation. Methods often reported include prolonged sleep
deprivation; beatings; prolonged restraint in painful positions, sometimes
combined with *exposure to loud music*; prolonged hooding; and exposure to
bright lights. Virtually none of the allegations of torture or ill-treatment
has been adequately investigated by the authorities."

Israel

On January 12 ,
1998the Supreme
Court of Israel
declined to ban
the use of loud music as an interrogation technique.
[10]

article from December 29, 1989, the US Army Special Operations Forces'
Panama playlist did include:

'Beat it' by Michael Jackson
'You're No Good' by Linda Rondstadt
'Nowhere to Run' by The Marvelettes
'Voodoo Child' by Jimi Hendrix
'I Fought the Law' by Bobby Fuller Four

And a post at
WFMU's Beware of the Blog lists Nazareth's "Hair of the Dog," Ann Peebles's
"Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down," "Judgement Day" by The Pretty Things, and
"Bruce Cockburn's "If I Had A Rocket Launcher" as part of the mix.

Special Poetics List discount

DEEP TRANCE BEHAVIOR IN POTATOLAND!
St. Mark's Church, New York
$18 tickets with the code word "poetics" when reserved over the phone or
web.
Call 212-352-3101 or visit http://www.ontological.com to arrange.
Offer good for shows through March 30.

Foreman provides one of the few out-of-body experiences in the American
theater. In this exquisite new work, probably the last of his
film/live-actor performance works, the actors present in the theater
play puppets to close-ups of actors (in Japan and England) repeating
ritual actions and lines. On screen, the actors, sometimes blindfolded,
repeating Foreman’s set phrases, cross the divide between reality and
the imaginary. Their stumbling and their accented speech approximate the
conditions of poetry. Foreman’s work has always had a ceremonial
dimension: paradise without religion. Film is elegiac, live action a
prop for our projected aspirations. One hour of nonproductive time in
the service of utopia.

Senator Vitter (R-LA) who launched this amendment, is himself a family
values guy exposed last year in a prostitution ring "entanglement."
Apparently this is his way of  trying to regain his "values" street cred.

slumbering monsters in many a rabid brain.  After all, this amendment passe=

Following scant debate, the Senate last week approved an amendment to an

dollars to fund abortions for Native Americans except in rare cases . . .

Apparently a phenomenon in Japan. None would call it great literature. Topics are often highly melodramatic. Originally written on cell phones, the stories are sent to a site which delivers them to literally millions of subscribers to be read on a cell phone. Now published versions are available. Some have sold 1.2 million copies. A Finn has published a novel written on his cellphone. He's joined by an Italian. In Japan, the writers tend to be young women writing for young women.

?

Nothing like it here in the U.S. One of the thoughts being that Japanese is more conducive to the form because of the packed meaning available in a single ideogram.? Or that the Japanese mobile novels move toward a more poetic rendering. ?Though with all the texting done in the U.S., you'd think it might catch on.

?

In any event, it sounded interesting to me, and it's got all the hallmarks of PP/FF. My phone allows 918 characters per post, about 170 words.

?

So I set up a blog: mobilenovel.blogspot.com

?

I'm writing one a day on a cellphone and then posting to the blog.

I'm jealous. Only New Yorkers get to see Foreman. That man has redefined theatre.

Charles Bernstein <bernstei@bway.net> wrote:  Special Poetics List discount
for Richard Foreman’s
DEEP TRANCE BEHAVIOR IN POTATOLAND!
St. Mark's Church, New York

Foreman provides one of the few out-of-body experiences in the American
theater. In this exquisite new work, probably the last of his
film/live-actor performance works, the actors present in the theater
play puppets to close-ups of actors (in Japan and England) repeating
ritual actions and lines. On screen, the actors, sometimes blindfolded,
repeating Foreman’s set phrases, cross the divide between reality and
the imaginary. Their stumbling and their accented speech approximate the
conditions of poetry. Foreman’s work has always had a ceremonial
dimension: paradise without religion. Film is elegiac, live action a
prop for our projected aspirations. One hour of nonproductive time in
the service of utopia.

Robert Kocik's RHRURBARB (the new, improved edition) is finally available!

Field Books=20
ISBN 978-0-9789262-1-2
Perfect-bound, 130pp.
$15

Available through SPD (Small Press Distribution), or through _ecopoetics_
(www.ecopoetics.org)

Can remission be written? Can words be so potent and so immediately so? Thi=
s
new title by Robert Kocik (Overcoming Fitness, Autonomedia, 2001) offers th=
e
Sore, Oversensitive Sciences a sustained and demonstrative exploration of
possible intersections between prosody and pathology. Two forty-six poem
series, Remissions and Cinnabar Verses, along with a Preface and a generous
Glossary, offer a good cross-section of Kocik's range, from prosody to
medicine, neuroscience and biogenetics, to Chinese alchemy and back. The
book is by turns metaphysically serious, tender, incisive, comically
hilarious, and always demanding of its audience, who will barely recognize
their own habits of thought, turned inside out. A rare and masterful return
to verse, from the Bureau of Material Behaviors.


Praise for RHRURBARB:

"The back of this book should be Julia Kocik=B9s recipe for oatmeal cookies.
The lines, nourishment, distilled drug, beyond balm, take effect pronto and
continue: both delivery and system of their time release potential.

Where poetry is seeing, Robert Kocik dares witness and record with the
precision of cellular scale.  Where poetry is hearing, Robert Kocik leads a=
n
alchemical prosodic band of entrainment, healing through frequencies,
annealing through registers, building through reverberation.

This poetry prolongs life in grace, in perfect pitches and measures, where
form is part helping of inner abundances, of the glowing heat attending
rings."=20

--Stacy Doris=20

"Robert Kocik=B9s civic concept of the prosodic body infuses language with
exuberance.  The poems that make up Rhrurbarb exude an agile lucidity
releasing a vital body biome, recuperatively.

Visceral brains articulate glistening confluences where physiognomy, the
sociochemical and word puncture unite.  Rhrurbarb=B9s lush, undulating
secretions are a cognitive joy."

--Brenda Iijima=20

"Robert Kocik likes to describe himself as a prosodist, as opposed to poet.
The distinction is ironic given the truly poetic, or cosmological,
implications of his unique contribution to missing fields and social
services, in 'sore, oversensitive sciences.'  If =B9pataphysics had a heart,
Kocik would be its Jarry."

THE BOOK MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WAITING TO FINALLY GET OUR HANDS ON!

The collaborative New Orleans book-length poem Frank Sherlock & Brett Evans
wrote together has just been released from Lavender Ink Press.

from publisher Bill Lavender:

*In New Orleans, USA, during the Year 1 A.K. (After Katrina), Frank Sherlock
& Brett Evans sifted through the ration fossils to put words where the food
used to be. The latest development resulted in a poem that is a
State-of-the-City and post-apocalyptic journal, sealed by a retort pouch and
blocked from future contamination. The resulting taste and texture are much
more realistic and natural than those normal dehydrated and freeze dried

Roiling encounters and reminder of Millennium show forthcoming.

Stories are constructed from narrative tropes, here reduced to the minimum
as policehamscanner tends towards gaps in transmission, bandwidth skit-
ters,

Who should find the fourteen-year-old boy, the burning apartment intact or
thrummed into oblivion, defuge of l.a., hostage, I remain at my desk,
there is one encounter, and for that as for many other,s, for example that
of a stranger in the city, I hear no end of it, nothing coming forth, no
glued to transmission reception, I will be your transitive, I will pass on
among ye, I will pass before and behind thee, I will pass within thee, I
will pass without thee, and that which I convey I have already forgotten,
I am yaw to your mind, larboard to your starboard.

Who will be that one awaiting completion, who will signify the order of
completing, awaiting the completing, passing swiftly by?

http://www.alansondheim.org/scanner1.mp3

Reminder: A screening of work at Millennium, 66 East Fourth Street, 8
p.m., Saturday March 15, of work pertaining to these and other emanents
generated and roiled among machines of transmission, filtering, reception,
with due explanation, a beautiful evening promised for one and all. Please
come if you are in the neighborhood of Manhattan, and thank you, we will
be more entertaining than policescanner and perhaps more musical

My daughter told me about the cell phone novels a couple years ago.  Her
interest grew out of personal experience (and interest in al things
Japanese.) She and her girlfriends were inventing their own cellphone
languages among themselves using a similar method to speak in their own
"codes"  You mix words, symbols, emoticons, letters capitals or small,
abbreviations, acronyms, punning sings, etc etc etc.

I posted this article here on buffalo list and to my blog from the  NY Times
when it came out in January.  There's a lot about these novels on the web
and you can check out the Japanese sites.
http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com/2008/01/cell-phone-novels-dominate-japanese.html---

As the article notes, Japanese women have been writing novels since Lady
Murasaki's The Dream of the Red Chamber in the 11 the century,

The contemporary cell novels are written by young people who don't read
"professional novelists," but are influenced by comic books.  The sentences
and paragraphs are short.  The style grew out of cell phone messaging, with
its brevity and removal of extraneous descriptions and backgrounds,
character developments.  Dialogue plays a great role.  All these are found
in the minimal texts of the comic books the writers read. One woman who used
to write cellphone works has moved on the computer due to her fingers
bleeding from the high speed punching of the cell phone style.  In the
article a commentator notes that her style is developing a richness and
depth not possible with the cell phone style.

I'd hesitate to say the cell phone novel is due to the "packed meanings of
the ideogram" as what the cell phone novels are noted for is the absence of
this.  They are a minimalization of elements and and depend on familiar
cliches for the high speed comprehension of "keeping it simple,"  using a
shorthand manner of communication that takes up less space as text and is
more quickly responded with.  The diary  form is used a lot because its
entries dealing with concentrated spaces of time works well for an emotional
development--the same method used for a millenium in many Japanese novels.

A huge international bestseller The Girls of Riyadh by the Saudi writer
Rajaa Alsanea. uses email exchanges a great deal.  At a very well attended
and enthusiastic reading of the novel and discussion afterwards, (in Arabic
and English) the author explained that in Muslim cultures as strict as Saudi
Arabia's, where there are strict restrictions on direct communication
between the sexes, women have been finding an expansion of freedom of
expression via emails, so this seemed a natural form to use in the novel.  A
lot of the diary entries and dialogues, reflections and thoughts, are al
conveyed as email messages rather than standard prose forms--because the
novel is really a development of the world that exists as email, as the cell
phone novels grew out of the text messaging world's methods of
communication.  It's not as condensed and simplified as the cell phone
novels, but for the author and her readers, works in the opposite direction,
allowing for a greater complexity of expression than allowed in other forms,
because it is among women seperate from men. Within the cultural contexts in
which this writing is emerging, this has had an immense impact.

This novel has been part of an upsurge in writing among women in Muslim
countries, as in writing women have already from the culture a shared space
which they are much more in control of than outside this community and among
males.

Here's a note re the ways in which the book, which has a fortune-telling
charcter--actaully forecast its own future in the media:

*An unknown girl in her early twenties decides to narrate the story of her
friends. She is like a modern Scheherazade that narrates these stories every
weekend. Her motivation is to revenge the tyranny of life and the society
against her friends. Each chapter in the novel starts with a piece of
poetry, a verse from the Quran, or lyrics from a famous song that captured
the idea of the chapter.

The narrator sends e-mails from her internet group to the subscribers. Those
e-mails as the narrator forecasts in the novel stir the media especially
popular newspapers in Saudi like Al-Riyadh, Al-Watan and Al-Jazeerah which
happened in real life after the novel was published. This kind of
forecasting added reality and intrigue to the novel. In one segment, the
narrator says that she will probably be interviewed on Al-Arabiya TV by one
of the most important interviewers in the Arab World: Turki Al-Dakheel (his
style is similar to Tim Sebastian in Hard Talk on BBC or Ted Koppel on ABC
news) which also took place.*

I think what's interesting is to find what a role women's writing plays in
making use of emails and text messaging in creating novels from out of
girls' and women's  inter-communications in different cultures around the
world. This is an aspect quite different in terms of changing writing and
discourses and society it is hoped via new technologies than the standard
ones usually discussed in the West re the same technologies.

 After all, it was my daughter who introduced me to the existence of the
cell phone novels a couple years ago and told me about the codes she and her
girlfriends were creating among themselves. It was exciting to her because
of the ways traditional women's roles and forms were being explored by women
writers using new technologies in ways which began from personal messaging
and launched surprise best sellers.  It meant a direct connect from a
personal world to a much larger community and readership that  is exciting
and different and can  have a large impact in society. . The
technological-cultural leaders were females, not the "usual suspects" and
the  same-old-same-old ideas of what may and may not be "radical."

Forced sterilizations were abhorrent as well.

And yes, David. Perhaps you might ease up on the rhetoric. When you
generalize or stereotype all Israelis, viz their government, should
you be lumped in with all the ugly Americans, viz our government? Any
language which objectifies others is suspect, whether from politicians
or artists.

Dear Stephen

No--it is saying that the old US ways are being retriggered by their new on=
es abroad.

The actions the US takes abroad come back to take effect here--

The contempt of human life the US expresses in Iraq and Afghanistan, is sta=
rting to launch into Pakistan and Somalia and is bound and determined to la=
unch into Iran and again in Latin America--

it expresses on peoples in the US.  Katrina gave ample evidence of this as =
does the treatment of immigrants, foreign employees  of US contractors in t=
he US "reconstructing" New Orleans , the decaying infrastructure, the lack =
of health care for millions, the continual savings and loan and mortgages b=
illion dollar rip offs, the treatment of veterans, the privatization of the=
 public sphere, the swelling poverty, the ever mounting debt to dump on the=
 next generations--

Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, Gaza, secret torture sites around the world--expres=
s the vast extent of this contempt and it is being spread all over again in=
side the US.=20

Being genocidal itself, the US has sponsored this all over the world, and t=
he singling out of the American Indians is  a reminder to others of what th=
e US can do and is doing.
On her last visit to Israel Condilezza Rice outraged her hosts because she =
kept saying how much it reminded her of the American South of her childhood=
 in the 1950s.  If thats what the US supports abroad, that's still what it =
supports here. =20
People talk about change, but this vote singingly out the Indians as usual,=
 shows that things may not have changed al that much after all in many ways=
.  (The 14th Amendment when first written and passed specifically excluded =
American Indians.)
No matter who is President, most of the same bunch that voted this through =
last week will still be in office. The corporations will still own that's b=
een handed over to them in the last 7 years, and the same wars will still b=
e going on, if not a few new ones, guided by the same polices.  I haven't h=
eard any of the candidates speak about human and civil rights, peace, respe=
ct and dialogue with others around the world. All they talk about is war an=
d terrorism and security .  And why?  because the only economy left anymore=
 is based on weapons and security and, as orwell predicted, an Endless War =
to keep alive the hatred and contempt.
The United States refused to sign the International Recogntion of the Right=
s of Indigenous Peoples--and this latest anti-Indian bill makes it very cle=
ar why they didn't.  The US still refuses to recognize Indians as human bei=
ngs equal with themselves. =20

This says plain as day Indians are not humans with rights like others.

"All animals are equal but some are more equal than others."

i just saw a documentary made by an Australian woman about her correspondan=
ce with an Iraqi woman before and during the War in Iraq.

The last email in the film from Iraq says simply:
"Don't they know we are not insects, we are human beings?"
Judging by the daily rhetoric across al the media in the US, one would have=
 to say--no.  The US thinks all but some of its citizens and a few of its f=
riends are insects.

A friend and I went to the American Indian Health Center here in Milwaukee =
and the Government is closing it down. Why waste money on insects?

When was the last time any of our "leaders" spoke about human rights? or fo=
r that matter civil rights?=20
All I hear speaking personally is nothing but more bombing more war more gr=
eed more killing more hate more self serving bullshit and feel-good lies, a=
nd such brilliant things as we need to focus on the "right war." And to be =
terrified out of our minds about Iran, Venezuela, the Indian President of B=
olivia, the Mexicans, the "hostile savage terrorists" among the American In=
dians like Leonard Peltier.=20

It still sounds like the terror of the Puritans faced with the "savages" an=
d the wilderness, the unknown that has to be annihilated so that it can be =
known and owned, and the witch trials to make sure no one has a dissenting =
or strange thought in the New Jerusalem.

"Whats so funny about peace love and understanding?"
It doesn't yield the fabulous billions that the fear and war and hate does.=
=20
It doesn't make some people feel truly great as they look down and squash t=
he insects.
For "reasons of security" it's not supposed to be possible to even think th=
ose thoughts anymore.
That means the fear and killing and prisons and poverty and hate are just g=
oing to keep rolling right along.
That's the message I hear anyway.

Hi everyone,

This one's in Tucson, so I don't imagine many on the Poetics List can
make it. But if you find yourself in the Sonoran Desert . . .

I hope you can come on Saturday night, March 15, at 7pm, to the
Drawing Studio, 33 S. 6th Ave. (halfway between Broadway & Congress
on the east side of the street), to hear me read along with visiting
San Francisco poet Beverly Dahlen.

Details at http://www.gopog.org

Also, a bit I wrote about Beverly's last book back in fall 2006 on my
blog at

	http://chax.org/2006/09/reading-reading-18-20-by-beverly.html

And if you can't make this one, perhaps you can make it on April 25,
6:30pm, when I read with Ron Silliman, with music by James Fei, at
the CUE Art Foundation, 511 W. 25th St. (between 10th & 11th
Avenues). That event takes place during the exhibition of paintings
by Cynthia Miller (whose paintings and art consultation & assistance
have been a key part of Chax Press over the last two-plus decades),
and the exhibition opening is April 24 from 6pm until 8pm. For more
information please see the CUE Art Foundation web site at

	http://www.cueartfoundation.org


Thanks,

Charles

Where is the stereotyping of Israelis? You might disagree with the characte=
rization of the system by which they deal with Palestinians as "apartheid" =
but it is not a characterization of any or all Israelis. =0A=0ABut speaking=
 of apartheid, see the artiicle by the Israeli journalist Yonatan Mendel in=
 this week's London Review of Books (http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n05/mend01_.h=
tml):=0A=0AIf the words occupation, apartheid and racism (not to mention Pa=
lestinian citizens of Israel, bantustans, ethnic cleansing and Nakba) are a=
bsent from Israeli discourse, Israeli citizens can spend their whole lives =
without knowing what they have been living with. Take racism (Giz=E2=80=99a=
nut in Hebrew). If the Israeli parliament legislates that 13 per cent of th=
e country=E2=80=99s lands can be sold only to Jews, then it is a racist par=
liament. If in 60 years the country has had only one Arab minister, then Is=
rael has had racist governments. If in 60 years of demonstrations rubber bu=
llets and live ammunition have been used only on Arab demonstrators, then I=
srael has a racist police. If 75 per cent of Israelis admit that they would=
 refuse to have an Arab neighbour, then it is a racist society. By not ackn=
owledging that Israel is a place where racism shapes relations between Jews=
 and Arabs, Israeli Jews render themselves unable to deal with the problem =
or even with the
 reality of their own lives.=0AThe same denial of reality is reflected in t=
he avoidance of the term apartheid. Because of its association with white S=
outh Africa, Israelis find it very hard to use the word. This is not to say=
 that the exact same kind of regime prevails in the Occupied Territories to=
day, but a country needn=E2=80=99t have benches =E2=80=98for whites only=E2=
=80=99 in order to be an apartheid state. Apartheid, after all, means =E2=
=80=98separation=E2=80=99, and if in the Occupied Territories the settlers =
have one road and Palestinians need to use alternative roads or tunnels, th=
en it is an apartheid road system. If the separation wall built on thousand=
s of dunams of confiscated West Bank land separates people (including Pales=
tinians on opposite sides of the wall), then it is an apartheid wall. If in=
 the Occupied Territories there are two judicial systems, one for Jewish se=
ttlers and the other for Palestinians, then it is an apartheid justice.=0A=

Here's an amazing archive of audio files:
http://www.wfmu.org/365/index.shtml. From the site:

365 days of cool and strange and often obscure audio selections.

Some words to describe the material featured would be... Celebrity,
Children, Demonstration, Indigenous, Industrial, Outsider, Song-Poem,
Spoken, Ventriloquism, and on and on and on. The best thing to do is to
simply listen.

Unlike a blog/journal/website consisting of one or a small group of
contributors, 365 Days has over 200 people sharing from their stash of aural
treasures.

This site is mirrored at UbuWeb and we thank you for downloading, listening
and sharing with others this material.

Yours,
The 365 Days Project

true world newsreel


The newsreel of part-objects, snippets of radio communication as heard,
stuttered stories which remain incomplete, deferred, a call for help from
a vessel, things burning, missing, people with guns, raptures, misrecogni-
tions, what makes the night go faster in Brooklyn New York and everywhere.
This is the truth of cinema, raw-fed documentary. If there were a narrato-
logical ground, this would be it; if there were recuperation, this would
be the initial stages of constitution. Everything defers to raw data,
which, by a circuitous route, announces itself, establishes sequencing by
repetition. Every inscription is unique, of a sort or type, typed. The
lexicon of events is narrow. Listening reveals nothing but whispers that
there is nothing to be revealed, or what is present is of revelation. What
remains to be said or inscribed is the coagulation of culture. Every
culture has a theory sifting coagulation; such a theory is culture. There
is no gainsaying this, no way to make headway, no events; there is voice.

The system IS the people, its victims and victimizers. If calling it
Nazism hasn't helped, I doubt describing it as apartheid will, even
though both might be closer to the truth. The powerless need more than
rhetoric, and revolutions usually only change the face of the
oppressor. So just exactly where has a more concise liberation
language affected the depth of change required for this or any other
conqueror's paradox? If other more powerful nations begin to press
their own misguided agendas in the region, we'll need a whole new
vocabulary to describe it. A country's electorate must have an
incentive to change a cycle of disastrous policies. Any constructive
ideas?

THE PUBLIC

somewhere this night
a son is dragged in the street
and left on the caked mud
his face contorted in a silent scream
his shiny eyes bulging in the darkness
quickly the rope is reclaimed
ululations pierce the heavy calm
and shouts of revenge echo
between quiet houses suddenly lit up
then sputter towards dawn
when the sun ignites the sky and
all resumes against hope

somewhere else
the light has gone out of her baby's eyes
she holds the dead child to her dry breast
lowering her head
whispering dry words of comfort
rocking

in secret places
lovers are right in their wetness
but when they separate
are recruited for a cause
by the hopeless knowing
the always already

I'd hesitate to say the cell phone novel is due to the "packed meanings of
the ideogram" as what the cell phone novels are noted for is the absence of
this.




Packed meaning in a single ideogram as compared to English. At least as how a Japanese student of mine demonstrated that a single ideogram would take several words in English if not a sentence to say the same thing.



As I've been writing the episodes -- and I have 6 posted now with several more already written -- I'm starting to observe the tropes I'm using.? I'm not someone who typically communicates through text message (the amateur you describe).? Email, yes, but in a business setting, which requires complete sentences.

?

I'm approaching this mobile novel project as a writer with a new form.? But I wonder if the form can work in English without resorting to ROFL and BFF and other similar abbreviations.? I don't know yet.? I am finding that I'm resorting to shorter sentences.? I'm also dumping description because of the space limitations.? I'm trying to do the work with brushstrokes.

?

I had thought about getting a full size keyboard for the text message device but that would change the way the pieces are being written.? You do go for shorter words when you only have your thumbs to type with. ?Also, as the counter of the characters remaining clicks down, you find yourself paring back further and further.

ROBERT MITTENTHAL & NICO VASSILAKIS Thursday, March 20, at 7:30 PM
Robert Mittenthal's latest book, _Value Unmapped_ ($10 Nomados), begins,"It=
's an unfortunate iron that walks stiffly over us, pressing our clothes.I m=
iss the comforts of a baggy garment which covers everything whilerevealing =
little." What follows is a gentle, meandering polemic, at timesoblique and =
at times direct, which often finds itself studying thepossibility that lang=
uage controls the individual rather than the other wayaround. Political and=
 economic speech are certainly part of this concern --"now shareholder valu=
e has become the sublime." Mittenthal's writing isdished out with a wryly c=
omic resignation. "Realizing the body's capacity toabsorb even more savage =
value, I took my daily constitutional. Prozac and asingle malt."
_Text Loses Time_ ($15.95 Many Penny) is the generous collection of NicoVas=
silakis's broadly ranging work. His poetry and prose move between theshimme=
ringly surreal and the flatly declarative. Alive with word play --"browsing=
, the brow singing" -- he can also masterfully layer images likelaying out =
a set of lovely clothing in which a body can be imagined -- "anew continent=
 spills from / her eyes. A glassful / of pencils. Anautobiography / compose=
d entirely of photos." But Vassilakis takes text astep further. He also man=
ipulates words, letters, and punctuation marks toconstruct visual poetry, t=
he arrangement of text free of meaning, so thelook of the building blocks o=
f printed language becomes the stuff ofnon-representational art. In one seq=
uence in the book what looks to bephotos of text on a bowing page are stret=
ched and bent, resulting in anpicture of a page with letters that becomes a=
s beautiful and as mysteriouslynearly legible as birch bark. Robert Mittent=
hal and Nico Vassilakis are bothmembers of Subtext, the vibrant experimenta=
l writing collective long basedin Seattle.

Dear David,

Is there any way to fight to overturn the amendment
regarding abortion and American Indians?

I think that the plan Bill Clinton proposed at the
Ta'ba continuation of the Camp David negotiations
could have been the basis for alleviating conditions
that may remind visitors of the old American South. As
I understand it, negotiations got hung up on the
Palestinian demand for total control of the complex of
religious shrines (both Muslim and Jewish) on the
Temple Mount, and the Palestinian demand for a Right
of Return. There was the bizarre outbreak of the
Second Intifada at that time.

The Irish Republican movement in Northern Ireland has
compromised regarding their historic demands, and I
don't believe that anyone in the worldwide Left is
shouting "stop! stop! you're betraying your own people
and the progress of world liberation!" The Left should
also be for compromise in the Middle East.

While I am not the biggest fan of The Human Rights Campaign, they do some
amazing work, like addressing Oklahoma Representative Sally Kern for
instance.  If you click HERE:
http://www.hrcactioncenter.org/campaign/ok_rep_sally_kern_cen/8ix8bs2l7bewkjj
?
you will find a link to a recording of Kern saying last week that
homosexuality is a bigger threat to our nation than terrorism or Islam.

Please take the time to check this out, and please take the time to respond
through the easy online form provided by The Human Rights Campaign.

We must not allow such things to go unchallenged,

Help! I am trying to locate a passage in Oppen's letters/daybooks/working papers/personal papers/essays/poetry wherein he states something like:

  "I am aware that the ground is very old" or that the "dirt is very old."

  This is a passage (I'm quoting from memory, so there is no question that the actual statement is different) that I read some time ago and have not been able to locate since.

  If anyone has any idea where I might/should look, please channel back and let me know.

  Thank you,
  Eric Hoffman

=8BThe Poets=B9 Primary
In late January Benka and Mirakove asked 100 poets, most of whom live in Ne=
w
York City, to answer three questions about the upcoming general election:
1. Which presidential candidate do you favor? (See table below)
2. Which TWO of the following issues-- Campaign Finance Reform, Civil Right=
s
(i.e.:., privacy, marriage equality), Corporate Lobbies, Economy, Education=
,
Environment, Immigration, Poverty, Post-Bush remediation (i.e., public
resources, poverty, repeal of No Child Left Behind, and repeal of penalties
for Pell Grants and felony convictions), Unequal Distribution of Wealth, an=
d
All of the Above--need to be addressed most urgently?
3. What thoughts, conflicts, or opportunities have you had around this
election (i.e., if you are feeling compromised in your vote, how is the
presidential election meaningful?).

           The cedar dies
 from the top,
 the prisoner dies
 in the pit
  Of nine strong bonds
 I’ve worn out eight
 the ninth one
 wearies me.
  Prisoners’ Song from the Hungarian
 Trevor Joyce, What’s in Store (Gig / New Writers Press, 2008)


  Good-by old man
 Turn the key
 Darkness is not your friend
 The willows bend


  Knock, knock, dear Reaper
 Open the black door
 Kill the cat
 Jump over me.


  Stephen Vincent, Untitled poem from the English of Trevor Joyce’s Prisoner Song in Folk Songs from the Hungarian.


  Lately I have dropped my ’sweet reed’, that is my Haptic making Faber-Castel India ink brush, to pick up various ball-point pens, filling my journal pages with a series of poems in a project I call Trellis. The writing process is built on metrical patterns from which I have copied frompoems by Trevor Joyce in his recent, and I think, brilliant volume, What’s In Store [If you not read my new review of the work, it’s published in Galatea Resurrects #9]
  With a Trevor poem, I simply match the line count, and then pair the lines either by their word count, or syllable count. I do closely read the originating poem and, sometimes, my content will mirror and comment on Trevor’s content, though, often any thematic relationship is, at best, oblique or not there at all. Trevor’s poems give my pieces a formal frame on which to rise and make words that fit. As with Trevor’s work, his forms compel a making that is similar to the challenges faced by a stone mason where the stones first need to be chosen in a way that will fit the structure. Imagination comes in to play as a means to pick words with an appropriate texture, color, etc. Those choices make the difference between a dull or interesting poem.


  The excitement of this kind of making is that the poem’s formal structure may provoke content/rhythms & a ‘music’ that in turns - sometimes an abrupt torque - may constantly surprise. What’s opened up on the page is, ideally, revelatory to both maker and reader. How this process is similar to surrealist and Ouilipo exercises, I suspect, has been discussed elsewhere. It does not interest me to go there right now. I am have too much obsessive fun watching new stuff pop out of the hat.

 Gone
 Sure blessing
 Cross without nails

 Beauty burns
 Such holes


   Backwards
 In bunches


  Braided
 Gold silk


  Slender throat
 Enamel
 White collar


  She
 Does not
 Belong to God

 Nor witness


  Blue silk
 Angels
 The sky pumped
 Clouded


  Pure
 Crimson.

 ("Binging away" on several in a row, I forgot to note the poem from where I got the formal count and arrangement on this one!)

 Appreciate your comments.

Hello all, (apologies if you've received this note more than once)
Evan Munday at Coach House has generously put together a launch to
celebrate the release of the first Open Letter issue on bpNichol , the
release of www.bpnichol.ca, and the publication of The  Alphabet Game.
It should be a really fun night and it would be wonderful to see some
of you in person.

Below are the details for the event  - hope to see you there and
please do forward the announcement to anyone you think might be
interested in coming.

best, Lori
------------

April 2 =96 We're bringing NicholBack
Literary event at Supermarket celebrates three new pieces of
Nicholmania from late Canadian author bpNichol

'His wit, along with the seriousness, was there to keep the language
free and untethered, to keep the poem aware of its roots, like a
tuxedo worn with bare feet in a muddy river ... No other writer of our
time and place was so diverse, attempted so much, and never lost sight
of his intent.' =96 Michael Ondaatje

A member of the sound-poetry performance group The Four Horsemen,
winner of a Governor General's Award for Poetry and writer of Fraggle
Rock, bpNichol was one of Canada's most important writers. Nichol was
the author of countless publications in a variety of forms, including
poetry (lyric, concrete, visual, sound). He was known as a promoter of
poetry and the small press, a manipulator of the lines between genres
and a prolific Canadian word artist, and they even named a Toronto
laneway after him.

In late 2007, Coach House Books published The Alphabet Game, edited by
Darren Wershler-Henry and Lori Emerson, a selected reader of Nichol's
work designed as an introductory overview to Nichol's texts. This
spring, Canadian literary criticism journal Open Letter publishes the
first of two new bpNichol-focused issues, and the long-awaited
bpNichol site, bpnichol.ca, is unveiled. The spring also sees the
release of Brian Nash's bp: pushing the boundaries on DVD.

To celebrate, Coach House Books, Open Letter and bpnichol.ca present
NicholBack, a stellar night of Nichol performances.

NicholBack
with performances by Paul Dutton, W. Mark Sutherland, Nobuo Kubota,
Frank Davey, Lola Lemire Tostevin, damian lopes, Gary Barwin and
a.rawlings.

Supermarket, 268 Augusta Avenue
Wednesday, April 2, 2008
8:00 p.m.

*  *  *  *  *

With an introduction of The Alphabet Game by co-editor Lori Emerson
the night is split into two rounds of performances.

Four Horsemen member Paul Dutton leads off the evening with a short
work from bpNichol, then he and fellow acclaimed sound poets W. Mark
Sutherland and Nobuo Kubota perform an entirely new collaborative
sound performance piece inspired by the work of bpNichol.

Following a break, five of today's most innovative writers =AD=96 Frank
Davey, Lola Lemire Tostevin, damian lopes, Gary Barwin and a.rawlings
=96 read their favourite Nichol works.

*  *  *

Actually, it isn't a rhetorical question. At issue is language like
David's, "One can imagine the massive US support for Israeli Apartheid
awakening the slumbering monsters in many a rabid brain," that
suggests a desire to punish, to turn tables, not break bread at them.
The peace sign of The Rebel is a liberalism, a compassion which
intends to liberate the oppressor as well. When we ask ourselves,
demand from ourselves concrete solutions and practical compromise, we
get to the core of our motivations. We discover our prejudices in
spite of our rhetoric. Fear is a vast impediment to conflict
resolution; so if our criticism and proposals contain the seeds of
revenge, how can they ever assuage fears or convince the oppressor or
terrorist to relinquish power?

Despite new reports that buy into the Chinese claim that only 10
people were killed in Tibet, satellite pictures evidently suggest the
number may be more like 500, with some 10,000 injured -- and much
more about to happen  -- hence the need for immediate protest.

It's like a library burned itself to the ground while we were sleeping. Ever
since hearing that Jonathan was in the hospital I've been thinking about him
everyday, but the thing is with someone like THIS MAN Jonathan Williams,
after you meet him you think about him often as it is.
Yesterday in Philadelphia poet Chris Martin gave an amazing reading with
Kevin Varrone and Paul Siegel.  Chris talked a bit about disequilibrium as a
force NECESSARY to make the possibility of new information to be taken,
processed, or, rather the building of new equations, new processors, new
ways for new ideas.  It makes me think about Jonathan Williams, as a poet,
as a person, in that, he is so unique that being around him, taking him in,
creates these new, before unknown spaces for us.  While there are many many,
marvelous, and generous elder poets, not many others can create such space
for us.

My time spent with Jonathan, and his lover Tom, and their cat HB Kitty (who
arrived on the night of the Hail Bob comet and MOVED IN), and Bruce the bat
(who lives in the eaves of the porch), is time spent in such a way that I
KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE, and want such time and space for others, and want to see
HOW to get that going for us.  The care of song, the importance of and FORCE
of song, thoughts, everything else from books to the Franklinia tree, all of
it can have a place for us, not just in place of brutality, but in spite of
it.

Very sad day.  But a beautiful day too, knowing what we can have.  Many
thanks to this passing GIANT!

David, YES, I agree with you!  And thanks for saying that.

And while I also like to walk around saying, "You SHOULD worry about me,
because queers like me who have been tormented physically and mentally are
afraid of NOTHING!", while I like to go around saying that, because it's
true, and feels GOOD, I also worry about kids who are queer.

I wish there was a way to protect queer kids from the kind of shit that
happens to them after publicly elected officials like Kern say the things
they say.  And the president.

AND HILLARY CLINTON, who was followed by a lesbian reporter who reported
how, while giving a speech in Manhattan said such Nice Things about gay
marriage.  Then, in Albany said VERY different things about marriage, and
what it Should Be.  Refer to the talk Harvey Fierstein gave on the many MANY
lies Bill and Hillary have fed the gay community.

But, my point is, gay bashing is at an all time high.  It's to the point
that young trans people are thrown out, VERY YOUNG, and live in the streets,
get murdered, and no police report will indicate that this was murder.  In
Philadelphia we battled with the police and City Hall JUST LAST YEAR after
Erika Keels, a young African American transwoman was murdered (the medical
examiner's report indicated she was run over 4 different times by the man
(her trick) who ejected her from his car and ran her down, backed over her,
ran her over again, turned around, and ran her over again) but her death
filed as "an accident," despite witnesses, etc., to the point that when we
held rallies here in the city governor Rendell sent a liaison from his
office (which is most likely WHY we didn't wind up in jail because the cops
had TWO BUSES at the rally, waiting to ship us all away).

But even after Rendell's involvement it's still filed as "an accident," and
we feel now that this is because the man (murderer) who did this was not
arrested (even though he not only killed someone but fled the scene), and
his car not impounded as evidence.  That car is now sold, gone, all traces
of his crime gone.  Meaning that the police would have to admit to having
been complicit in the coverup for not doing their job in the first place.

Anyway, I could literally go ON AND ON, including telling you what it was
like working in Philadelphia's queer bookstore when neo-Nazis did a drive-by
and shot and killed a drag queen a block from the store, only to have
several other drag queens run for their lives and wind up inside the store
where we called the police.

Murder and suicide, and bashing are at an all time high, and when ASSHOLES
like Sally Kern say the STUPID things they say it creates space for
brutality.

When the president says homophobic things it creates space for brutality.

I met a lesbian from Italy recently who told me that when the pope says
homophobic things that gay bashing in Rome goes through the roof.  (She also
told me (very interesting) that MORE little girls have been reported as
being molested by priests than boys.  Yet the target has ONLY been priests
who molest boys.  Wow, if that doesn't shake to the core the problems of our
world!)

I feel VERY LUCKY to have survived to the point where I know I'm not going
down without a fight, but I worry about the kids who don't have that thick
skin yet.  It's a tricky thing developing that skin, because sometimes they
get you before you get it on.

But yes, I agree with you at the same time David, and thanks for saying what
you said,
CAConrad

There are many more poems from this book one could NOT quote on this list,
which I suppose speaks to its peculiar virtues.

Isabelle and I managed to visit Jonathan and Tom for a couple of hours on
Bloomsday last year (2007) and were--as was always the custom on Scaly
Mountain--graciously hosted.

Tom served us salmon on crackers and gave us a tour of the sprawling, and
jaw-dropping, art collection; Jonathan had his bundled feet up; the coffee
table stacked with fat mystery novels and a video yuletide log crackling in
the ironic fireplace.

Jonathan looked ready to leave this life--not much good with no walking left
in it for him--but dispensed his usual droll and dry wit.  As to his poems:
"they tell me they're funny."

We drank the Jameson I'd brought while Tom refilled Jonathan's martini
glass.  At one point, Jonathan wearied of our movie talk and decided to test
my knowledge of Haydn (I failed miserably).  I was listening to the hermit
thrushes singing off the porch in the deepening dark . . .

So long, Jonathan.  My "points is blue" at this news indeed.

He died in her sleep.

(or: She died in his sleep.)

'For vices all have different ends,
But virtue still to virtue tends.'
(Swift)
The long and narrow road, catastrophe theory's fragility of good things,
beset on every side by the efflorescence, fecundity, of vice; if Heaven is
pure substance, Vice is impure inscription; if Heaven is continuous, Vice
is discrete; if Heaven is discrete, Vice is the heart of indiscretion
itself.

He died in their sleep. In their longing for rest, he was one of the
forgotten, his body withering away to practically nothing, his data-base
entries under erasure, digitally smudged, evaporated. Perhaps he said
something, anything, at one point, but pronouns long since disappeared.

'_The chora,_ which is neither "sensible" nor "intelligible," belongs to a
"third genus" (_triton genos,_ 48e, 52a). One cannot even say of it that
it is _neither_ this _nor_ that or that it is _both_ this _and_ that."
(Derrida)
Sheffer added another before his death, not _both_ this _and_ that.
I added these comments, as well, before my death, which I await, again, in
someone else's sleep, that unknown of dreaming I shall never greet.

SPEAKING THE ESTRANGED: ESSAYS ON THE WORK OF GEORGE OPPEN

by Michael Heller

Speaking the Estranged brings together the work=20
by Michael Heller on the distinguished American=20
Objectivist poet George Oppen=20
(1908-1984).  Written over the past twenty years=20
since Heller's first book on the Objectivists,=20
Conviction's Net of Branches, these essays cover=20
the range of Oppen's poetry and the ways it has=20
been read at all stages of his career: from his=20
overtly Objectivist roots through his abandonment=20
of poetry for political activism in the thirties=20
to his renewed poetic output after the=20
1950s.  Heller's sustained and astute attention=20
to Oppen, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry=20
in 1968, illuminates what many consider to be one=20
of the most remarkable, complex and original=20
bodies of work in twentieth-century literature.

Michael Heller=92s engagement=ADpersonally,=20
critically, and poetically=ADwith George Oppen is=20
without parallel.  Extending from his early=20
correspondence with Oppen to his groundbreaking=20
book on the Objectivists, Conviction=92s Net of=20
Branches, to the acute ethical probing of his own=20
poetry, Heller has attempted to take the measure=20
of Oppen=92s achievement from every conceivable=20
angle.  This new book, published in the year of=20
Oppen=92s centennial, displays the full fruits of=20
one major poet=92s encounter with another.

exhilarating examination of those 20th century=20
literary, political, and philosophical currents=20
that have carried us into our tumultuous=20
present.  As luminous a critic as he is a poet,=20
Heller renews our engagement with =93the mind=20
operating in a marvel which contains the mind,=94=20
as George Oppen once put it.  Through Oppen,=20
Heller locates us and brings us home.  When you=20

The release of these DVDS  of Melies' work is one of the major film
events--art events -- of this or any other year.

During the days of the Landing on the Moon, I was living in a tiny apartment
in Paris at an address that i learned later had once  been Rimbaud's. with a
tiny cell of Anarchists who worked at the Renault factory.  As we made
plastiques, the French TVs stacked in a Nam June Paik arrangement against a
disintegrating wall had the usual collection of philosophes and experts
discussing the American triumph in the Race to the Moon.

(The courtyard of the Old Soldiers Home Rimbaud describes in a poem was
still there, below the windows, at the time--and still with Old Soldiers
dozing in the sun.  Perhaps one of them even a long preserved "model" for
Rimbaud's  eyes a century earlier.)


Ah!! But!!--A commentator pointed out that actually the FRENCH had ALREADY
BEEN TO THE MOON!
After all Jules Verne had sent Americans there first in his novel, and
Melies had filmed this in the first years of the twentieth century!!
The film by Melies was then shown as "proof" that indeed, the French had
been their first, in Verne's sending a novel's Americans there, or via the
cinema of Georges Melies.

(The French experts conveniently forgot that Melies also made use of H. G
Wells' First Men in the Moon.)

In an ongoing series "After Rimbaud's Illuminations" is my account of this:

Jean-Pierre is cooking horsemeat in blood and wine with garlic. It makes the
cramped L shaped apartment in the slowly collapsing building all the hotter.
Marcel is showing me how to make plastiques. His hard hands work slowly so I
may learn. For once we are not smoking with cigarettes hanging from our
lips. We are not suicidal after all. Certainly not on such a night. Marcel
says three girls are coming. We will fuck them in the ass. He says they are
very tight this way. But no children you see, he says, no complications. The
three stacked tvs are talking incessantly about the approaching moon
landing. Some famous person is saying that in Jules Verne's books and
Melies' very early film classic the French have been there first. You see
what assholes they are Marcel says. They think they own history. With these
little bombs we will make a hole in history and then--and then--the people
will rush in. The little bombs are almost done and Jean-Pierre is calling us
to come eat meat and blood and wine and garlic. We will light candles but
not say Grace. The three virgins are coming for us. Perhaps one can enter
heaven backwards. It is very hot in here.

One might see the American version being the Lumiere Brothers rival form of
cinema to that of Melies.--a technical recording of "objective events." A
"cinema verite" combined with a reportage by Dziga Vertov's agit-prop train
mobilized Kino Pravda, "remade" with the dull efficiency of American
television and NASA footage.

This in turn, via the Conspiracy theorists, was re-transformed into the
Melies genre as the Faked Moon Landing, filmed in studios and broadcast
"live" from sets and recordings, filmed with "actor-astronauts" and the
stilted staccato speech of technicians which Tom Wolfe writes about The
Right Stuff, so seemingly at odds with the magnitude of the realization of a
voyage hitherto only imagined and dreamed of.
(An old issue of LIFE I have re the moon landing has a truly awful poem by
James Dickey written re the occasion.)

Transposed to a Mars Landing, the conspiracies found "major box office"
expression in the 1978  film Capricorn One starring Rock Hudson, in which
the spacecraft is identical to the Apollo One used to reach the moon.
For an excellent introduction to the myriad conspiracy theories and links
see:
Apollo *Moon Landing* hoax theories - Wikipedia, the free
encyclopedia<http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=3&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FApollo_Moon_Landing_hoax_accusations&ei=P-HfR8PpOJi6zQTq7-muAw&usg=AFQjCNFa-8tpMASy5DF3KJcDN4MU-eVmyw&sig2=2Yohpd53f5h37zF9GdXJ7w>Actually,
the first modern writer to have created BOTH a moon landing and a
moon landing hoax--is--who else?--but Edgar Allan Poe, having accomplished
this in 1835.

So--not only had the Americans originally gone to the moon and faked going
there first, they were doing so all over again over a century later!

Sadly, more than Wolfe points out, there is however a significant decline in
the language used for the events, real or hoaxed, from that of Edgar Poe to
that of James Dickey and Network Television and NASA. And in Capricorn One
for that matter!

Perhaps the Space Voyagers of the Future may learn from Melies and Poe a
doubled awareness of the imaginary elements at the heart of the "real," and
the ultra high octane propulsion concocted of fiction, hoaxes, magic (Melies
was a stage magician by trade) and their doubled, punning senses of
"exposure" in film (and as news stories, as "developing news" in Poe's
case)  as at once the "developing" of "real/reel images" of the "set" and
fictional stories and dialogues, and as fictions which "expose" the
"real/reel" which presents story-plots and conspiracy-plots which end up
"fore-telling" the "documented events" of their futures which are in turn
perceived almost immediately as possibly being "hoaxes" via the "plot
elements" "planted" in the "original versions."

In "The Philosophy of Composition," Poe notes that the primary goal of a
poem is the achievement of a desired effect, a Philosphy not unlike that of
the Magician Melies who creates effects "out of thin air."  The effect
demonstrates to the audience the presence of a reality which without the
poet or magician goes unseen. To make visible the invisible and invisible
the visible, to chart the voyages back and forth and in-between these
realms, to double back and forth  between "real/reel" effects and the
illusions which create them, and the illusionary effects created by actual
materials, (the materials & techniques of the poem Poe writes of, the
materials & techniques  Melies uses as film maker) is to produce the new
genres of "science-fiction" and "sci-fi cinema" which in turn inspire and
"fore-tell" historical events and their "documentations.  Which in turn
become suspected of being, after all, conspiracy plots making use of
"science fiction" and "sci-fi cinema" techniques and effects.

The hoaxing poet who invented the detective who uses rational methods of
thought to solve fictional crimes based on "real events" as they are
occurring and reported on as "developing news" in the first "newspaper wars"
("The Mystery of Marie Roget" as superbly investigated in Daniel Stashower's
The Beautiful Cigar Store Girl:  Mary Rogers, Edgar Allan Poe and the
Invention of Murder) and the magician turned film maker who uses fictions
to "develop a real/reel document" may be seen as creating the contemporary
"scene." A "scene" in which  combinings of hoaxes and forgeries in the
creation of historical events such as the Iraq War and the proliferations of
disinformations, edited and altered "documents" and "footage"  manipulate
and propel the "spectacular events" and  "dramatic effects" which constitute
"daily life" in a media-saturated globalized "theater of war" called "the
War on Terror."
In the visions of Poe and Melies, one finds a doubling of "magical thinking"
and technology
in which rational and irrational thoughts and desires combine for the
attainment of an effect which is simultaneously an illusion and a reality.
This destabilizing creates an "uncertainty principle" at the core of
technology's aspirations to "objectivity"  in the creation of "developing
news" and "reports on progress."  The "magical/poetic" effect produced
introduces "Conspiracy Theory" as an integral element in the Propaganda of
the Real/Reel.

Via the doublings of "magical/poetic effects" and technology as a
"fore-telling", is a reply Poe made to American critics' attacks on his
seemingly "foreign" (mainly "German")  tales compared to the more wholesome
"American" fare of his peers.  "Terror is not of Germany, but of the Soul."
And so via the Soul there enters "the Global War on Terror."

And also for both Poe and Melies, the Space Race, the desire to find other
globes to which travel, explore, whether as  "real/reel developments," or as
hoaxes and magic tricks the "effectiveness" of which may in turn be used as
the inspiration for ever more technologically spectacular and spectral
"effects"--with which literally to "bombard" "target audiences" and create
also the "scenes of carnage" known as "accidents" and "collateral damage."
An in this way, "effects" become the producers of yet another genre, another
aspect of the "Philosophy of Composition" and "magic/camera tricks--"side
effects"--

*Poe predates both Verne and Wells, as well as the Melies brothers, with his
own voyage to the moon. Poe published "The Unparalleled Adventure of One
Hans PFaall" in the June 1835 issue of the Southern Literary Messenger.
Poe's voyager travels to the moon in a balloon (see Poe's "The Balloon Hoax"
for another 'steampunk' fantasy). While Poe planned for this to be the first
installment in a series designed as a hoax, the New York Sun began a six
part series which came to be known as the "Great Moon Hoax" in the August
25, 1835 edition of the daily newspaper. These articles proclaimed the
discovery of life on the Moon. The fake author of the article, Dr. Andrew
Grant, reported the discoveries were made by real life astronomer Sir John
Herschel using a newly developed telescope. The hoax describes fantastic
animals on the Moon, as well as trees and oceans, and bat-like humanoids who
have built temples. The true author of the article has been attributed to
reporter Richard Adams Locke, although he never publicly admitted to being
the author. Reportedly, while Sir Herschel was amused at his name and fame
being used in the article, he later became disturbed whenever confronted
with questions from people who took the hoax as true. Feeling that his story
was too far fetched by comparison, Poe gave up on the idea of any more
articles furthering his 'voyage to the moon' hoax.*

with little or no way to enter the novel, I dutifully slugged through it =

In November 2007, I was invited to perform in the kgb Bar Reading =

perform them, but I needed a second voice, a Hemingway. Happily, Nayland =

the process of rehearsing and thinking about this project, Nayland =
suggested that he might write his own version. His text, Also Also Also =

possibilities for reading the piece and for dispelling the authority of =
the "original." - Rob Fitterman

The Rape of Tamar

On BBC News tonight, I learned that sins=20
Are no longer confined to seven.

"We are losing the notion of sin,"=20
Pope Benedict XVI (born Joseph Ratzinger) said.=20
"If people do not confess regularly,=20
they risk slowing their spiritual rhythm," he added.

In lieu of pride and avarice,
The Holy See has now decreed
Seven Moral Evils:
=E2=80=9CEnvironmental pollution,
Genetic manipulation,
Accumulating excessive wealth,
Inflicting poverty,
Drug trafficking and consumption,
Morally debatable experiments,
Violation of fundamental rights of human nature.=E2=80=9D

So sloth and lust now flank the evil of
Accumulating excessive wealth.
One friend of mine inquired,=20
=E2=80=9CIsn=E2=80=99t your Vatican dipped in gold?=E2=80=9D
If only that papal hand were shaking a finger
At the robber barons and their sons without
Envying, not to mention coveting their jewels,=20
As a sin-eater devouring=20
Their plenary indulgence as catechism.
One part of me thought that gluttonous.

My eyes cross, an altered staff of robes,=20
Meals of modified Eucharist=20
Fashioned from milk and water growth hormone.=20
Below that rises up a garden of deplorable humans,
Paedophilic gestures,=20
Consumption of all alms,
A liturgical feast of saints.

I want to feel martyred, simmering immolation
Like the Genesis story of Tamar and Judah
When a tribe or clan could order the burning
Of an unmarried female member of his household
If discovered to be pregnant.=20
Wasn=E2=80=99t that an early abortion?

Crimes against the body,=20
In the name of human dignity defeated
English common law which urged termination=20
Before the =E2=80=9Cquickening of the fetus=E2=80=9D
Induced by execution and suffocation
Far before the Inquisition.

They spoke of that same girl as a prostitute
And whored her out first to father and then to son,
Paying her in goats.
Tamar sent a message to Judah
Complete with his signet and cords
Announcing righteous inheritance.=20
Her heir was said to be ancestor to the Christ.=20
She had every right to be angry.

Now the rule is posing to thwart global warming,
A sky once scorched with the flesh of girls
Who would never rise to power in red velvet.

New on The Hyperliterature Exchange for March 2008: a review of 'The Way
North' Joel Weishaus.

"The page as a whole... is giving off all sorts of different signals about
its content, and the experience of reading it is dominated by moments of
transition, from one voice to another, one type of discourse to another,
and one text-style to another. The overall impression is that this is not
the kind of smooth, homogenous discourse we are used to reading in print,
but the text equivalent of a collage."

				Protests on 5th anniversary of Iraq war																																								By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN, Associated Press Writer1 hour,  22 minutes ago


													
Octogenarian Jim Barron has hearing aids and a pacemaker. The
prostate cancer survivor received a cortisone shot this month to ease
the pain from an old shoulder injury.
"It got to the point where I couldn't lift a glass of water," Barron said.


Despite his aches, Barron planned to risk arrest Wednesday, the
fifth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which has claimed the
lives of nearly 4,000 U.S. troops. He's part of a nationwide peace
movement using the anniversary to protest with nonviolent civil
disobedience.


Anti-war protests were scheduled in Washington, D.C., where
demonstrators vowed to block the entrance to the Internal Revenue
Service and to disrupt the offices of lobbyists who represent military
contractors and oil companies profiting from the war.


College students from New Jersey to North Dakota planned walkouts,
while students at the University of Minnesota vowed to shut down
military recruiting offices on campus. Barron geared up to participate
in a protest in Hartford, Conn.


"This is the first time coordinated direct actions of civil
disobedience are happening," said Barbra Bearden, communications
manager for the group Peace Action. "People who have never done this
kind of action are stepping up and deciding now is the time to do it."


The Iraq war has been unpopular both abroad and in the United
States, although an Associated Press-Ipsos poll in December showed that
growing numbers think the U.S. is making progress and will eventually
be able to claim some success in Iraq.


The findings, a rarity in the relentlessly unpopular war, came amid
diminishing U.S. and Iraqi casualties and the start of modest troop
withdrawals. Still, majorities remain upset about the conflict and
convinced the invasion was a mistake, and the issue still splits the
country deeply along party lines.


Activists cite frustration that the war has dragged on for so long
and hope the more dramatic actions will galvanize others to protest.


"If you are determined and your cause is right, the American people will eventually come around," Barron said.


Though he has participated in demonstrations for decades, Barron has
never risked a trip to jail. He opposed the war from the beginning and
has written letters of protest to Congress, but his feelings
intensified while hearing the names of the war dead read each week in
his church.


The final straw, he said, was reading an article about U.S. soldiers who suffered permanent brain damage in Iraq.


"I'm tired of being a futile old man not able to have any
participation in this decision," Barron said. "I'm 80 years old. I'm
still alive. I want people to say, `If he's not afraid to do it, what
am I doing being so silent?'"


Barron, who ran a kitchen remodeling business with his wife before
he retired in 1995, said he helped organize efforts to integrate
restaurants in Richmond, Va., during the 1960s. He saw police drag
college students from lunch counters, and said authorities stood and
watched as the students were attacked on sidewalks.


But the attacks only encouraged more protesters to engage in civil disobedience, he said.


"I saw the effectiveness of civil disobedience," Barron said. "Those
kids paid a helluva penalty, but they got the good people of Richmond
awakened. This chemistry needs to happen again."


Planning to join Barron on Wednesday were his minister, the Rev.
Kathleen McTigue, and others from his Unitarian church in New Haven.
McTigue said she was surprised when Barron told her he wanted to join
the action, but he assured her he was up it.


"I'm very proud of him," McTigue said. "I find him very inspirational."

Demonstrators Mark 5 Years of War With Protests Across District

By Petula Dvorak
Washington Post Staff Writer
Wednesday, March 19, 2008; A03

Scoresof demonstrators opened two days of war protests yesterday with araucous morning march along Constitution Avenue and a piece of silentstreet theater during the evening rush hour inside Union Station.


Afull day of rallies, marches, blockades and demonstrations is plannedtoday for downtown Washington to mark the fifth anniversary of thestart of the war in Iraq.
Activists plan to blockade the headquarters of the Internal Revenue Service,at 12th Street and Constitution Avenue NW, as well as offices ofvarious corporations in the vicinity of K Street between 13th and 18thstreets NW. Antiwar veterans plan a 9 a.m. march on the Mall from the National Museum of the American Indian to the Capitol.


Other events are planned at the Department of Veterans Affairs, McPherson Square, Lafayette Square, the American Petroleum Institute and the Democratic National Committee. A "March of the Dead" from Arlington National Cemetery into the District is set for 9:30 a.m. Other demonstrators will target The Washington Post and other news outlets.


Permits filed with the National Park Serviceby United for Peace and Justice, the umbrella group organizing theprotests, estimate that crowds at the midweek demonstration will likelybe in the hundreds rather than the thousands.


Yesterday's events began with a march by about 60 members of the antiwar group Code Pink,who held aloft a living room-size copy of the preamble to theConstitution, beat drums and carried peace signs. They marched alongConstitution Avenue from the National Archives to the Justice Department and to the IRS, occasionally disrupting traffic.
About 30 police officers on bicycles and motorcycles and in cars followed them. No arrests were made.


"You're blocking traffic!" a police officer yelled at the protesters as they veered off the sidewalk and into the street.
"We're well aware of that!" one protester yelled back.


At
5:25 p.m., at least 100 people froze in place at the bustling Union
Station: A couple kissing, a woman bending over to tie her shoe,
several people pointing to maps, a couple sitting at the bar with
drinks held halfway to their mouths. All stopped in mid-motion and did
not move for 10 minutes in a show of support for the antiwar movement.
Passersby
towing suitcases weaved their way through the tableau, dubbed "Frozen
Union Station." Dozens of police officers stood by; again, no arrests
were made.
"This is the strangest thing," said Michele McKnelly, a librarian from River Falls, Wis.,initially unsure why everyone around her had suddenly stopped. "Then Ilooked around and saw some of them wearing 'End the War' T-shirts."


At 5:35 p.m., the protesters started moving and chanted "End the war" for 10 minutes, then left.
"It was a very, very positive event," said protester Deanna Gorzynski, 52, of New Milford, N.J., who is with a group called the World Can't Wait. "Even those people who don't agree with us stopped to think."

Three males in the NEWS staying just news - one blind and black, one
gay, and the third a courageous, former Wall Street cheats' confronting
attorney general - all state governors admitting selfish sex acts and

Some would call it "politics," some would call it "man eating doggerel,"
and some would call it "just plain writing," and I'm sure some would
hesitate to call it poetry or poetics, and that's okay, too...

Man I wish I could be there. Everybody should buy the anthology though. And=
 not just 'cause I'm in it, but because so many cooler poets than me are.

Subject:      you need to purchase books from jwcurry
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

Called the best concrete and visual poet in Canada as well as the third
largest collector of small (& micro) press in Canada, Ottawa
writer/editor/publisher/bookseller jwcurry is going through financial
straits, so I am posting this (first) list of some (selected) items you can
purchase directly from his Room 302 Books; other items available by
various writers such as Stuart Ross, bpNichol, Frank Zappa, Nicholas
Power, Peggy Lefler, Nelson Ball, David UU, Daniel f. Bradley, Mark Laba,
Lillian Necakov, Steven Smith, Laurie Fuhr, William Hawkins, Steve McCaffery,
issues of Open Letter, The Berkeley Horse and others; check with curry
directly for other lists, titles, etcetera. If you want to know more about
some of jwcurrys publications, check out the piece I wrote on him in Open
Letter (or wait a few weeks for the same piece to run in my collection of
literary essays); hes an indispensable resource that isnt taken advantage
of nearly enough. Items run from into the hundreds of dollars to mere a
penny; annual subscriptions available.

In Figures for a Darkroom Voice the rhetorical twisting of Noah Eli Gordon=
=92s abstractions meld with the ominous narratives of Joshua Marie Wilkinso=
n=92s fragments, turning Wallace Steven=92s notion of a supreme fiction tow=
ard a supreme friction, one where the work of these two poets is fused into=
 a voice as singular as it is sinister. Imagine a gallery in which Cornell =
boxes talk back, a Maya Deren film in which the audience dissolves into pro=
jector light, a Philip Glass composition played exclusively on medieval wea=
ponry, such are the compelling results of this collaborative work.=20
=20
In prose poems, syntactically elusive sonnets, and haunting, haiku-like fra=
gments illuminated by the ink drawings of Noah Saterstrom, one encounters a=
 recurring cast of logically-skewed images, inauspicious yet arresting apho=
risms, and characters rendered fully bizarre in the lightest of brushstroke=
s. Here, the slippage and disruptions of textually investigative work colli=
des with the mind-expanding project of conjuring paradox, while never quite=
 leaving linearity behind. When these poets write, =93I am trying to draw y=
ou a simple picture of explanation,=94 one realizes the monumental nature o=
f such a task. And this task is made more complex, and ultimately more rewa=
rding, by the inclusion of Noah Saterstrom=92s dynamic images. =93Who,=94 G=
ordon and Wilkinson ask, =93operates the levers in this darkroom dress-shop=
?=94 Who, indeed! The rich history of literary collaboration just got riche=
r.=20
=20

could not ourselves develop in the basement=94so we know=93the sleepwalkers=

007; selected by John Ashbery for the National Poetry Series), A Fiddle Pul=
led from the Throat of a Sparrow (New Issues, 2007), Inbox (BlazeVOX, 2006)=

I'm going nowhere, but I'm going straight.
There's a bridge ahead, what if I go right?
What if I go left, there's a bridge ahead.
The bridge vectors the world, what if it's 3-d?
What if something's underneath, dark woods and trolls?
Or picture of dark woods or wandering, I'm too wandering.
Everything's washed away, my tongue's cut out.
I can't take this picture and I took this picture.
I can't take it anywhere, I'm going nowhere.
MY PATH IS LIKE A TWIG. I'm Hyperion and you are too.
There's nothing in the stream between one fork and another.
But the earth, the earth.

Years ago I wrote how stupid I was. Stupid stupid stupid.
Isn't this proof, do you need any more?
MY PATH IS LIKE A BROKEN TWIG. It's on the road somewhere.

    Blanche Howard
    Gerald Lynch

CARLA HARRYMAN presents an informal talk & reading as part of the
Transparency Machine Event Series on Monday 24 March, 4:00 - 5:30 PM, Oak
Room, Vanier Hall, University of Windsor, Ontario. All welcome.

Texts that she has selected for her discussion are downloadable at News &
Events, http://web4.uwindsor.ca/english.

A poet, playwright, novelist, and essayist, Harryman's recent publications
include the book-length poem Open Box (Belladonna, 2007), the novel
Gardener of Stars (Atelos, 2001), Baby (Adventures in Poetry, 2005), & the
selected mixed-genre writings, There Never Was a Rose Without a Thorn
(City Lights, 1995). Adorno's Noise is forthcoming from Essay Press. She
co-edited Lust for Life: On the Writings of Kathy Acker (Verso, 2006).

The Transparency Machine Reading Series is a discussion event about the
practice and theory of writing poetry - including practices and theories
of prefixing poetry ("anti-"; "non-"), adjectivizing poetry ("poetic"),
and capitalizing poetry (first letter; letters at random). The series
invites a poet to discuss his or her work in the context of other texts
selected and projected by the poet.

Carla Harryman's event is made possible thanks to the Centred on Learning
Innovation Fund, and to the Department of English Language, Literature, &
Creative Writing, University of Windsor.

For further information, please contact Louis Cabri, lcabri@uwindsor.ca

story and images for today

< images from today's work with new media class,
Azure Carter, Gary Manes
we're beginning to 'pack' these (these are point-sets)
narratives emerge out the other end
punctum in points, swirl-objects emptied of substance: the grid >

{but what sort of narratives? one can comic-strip images; if the tableau
is 3-d, an .obj file is apropos, Blender or other viewer. think of moving
around a static landscape, everything literally still-born.

people move within a scanning field, hold poses or continue on. events are
transformed by an absence of disappearance, only transformations of view-
point. everything is there, just as one might have planned, frozen moments
at the end of the universe.

events are collapsed, as if they're time sliced, 4 into 3 into 2-d, then
everything unravels at the other end, it's up to you, bring in the soft-
ware, I'll supply the objects. then you might explore something stolid,
interactive by its very nature, you come in wherever you want, leave
whenever. now I must retire, Jezebel's on television, moving about in a
very limited area, and I'm breathless.}

[I am the master of the stolid still-born narrative, master of the dead
skin sheave-skin emanent. I make fake and I make fake real. fine me, don't
mind me; I wryte the stories into dead-space.]

(please view at 1/1; otherwise you might get moire patterns, or at least
an unwanted thickening, pixels clambering on pixels, no space left
anywhere. for .obj/.mtl, try Blender, blender.org)

Hello,

I'm trying to find the source and actual quote of something that I
remember Antonin Artaud saying once: that if he could literally put a
lemon into the poem instead of the word lemon he would.

That was Artaud, right? It doesn't entirely sound like something that
he would say but it's in my mind as his idea. Does anyone know the
exact quote or where it is from?

And has anyone read any other good stuff about the literalization of
metaphor or the metaphorizatin of the real?

Hey Everyone-

We had a great time last month with some excellent poets and
singers...please join us this month as we welcome a special featured
poet...the man has quite a resume.....an open mic will follow him...come
on out read/perform/sing/stand up
comedy/...monologue...whatever.....March 27th 7-9 pm...BYO...At the Set
Table...3572 Indian Queen Lane ...Philadelphia, Pa 19129...267 312 7108
questions or email me...here is Alexander's resume/bio

Alexander Jorgensen was born and raised of the most mixed and common
stock. An incessant traveler, he has lived in the United States, the
Czech Republic, the Galapagos Archipelago, India's Himachal Pradesh (in
the lap of Himalaya), and the People's Republic of China (where he has
divided his time since 2002).

His work has appeared in both online and print journals, among those
including One Less, Noon, Otoliths, Shampoo, Big Bridge, and Kabita
Pakshik (translations into Bengali by poet and translator, Subhashis
Gangopadhyay). "Letters to a Younger Poet," correspondences with the
late Robert Creeley, appears in Jacket Magazine #31.

Of his first, self-published chapbook, In Deference to Ahab, Robert
Creeley wrote: "Here persons seem inside out, often at the painful edge
of contact, each moment a tacit particularity of the flesh. The
brilliance of the poet reassures us, yet this walk on the wild side is
as perilous as ever."

Marianne Moore used the phrase, not quote as I'm not certain if it is or
not, of an imaginary garden with real toads.

Subject: Literal lemons, Artaud, metaphorization of the real

Hello,

I'm trying to find the source and actual quote of something that I
remember Antonin Artaud saying once: that if he could literally put a
lemon into the poem instead of the word lemon he would.

That was Artaud, right? It doesn't entirely sound like something that
he would say but it's in my mind as his idea. Does anyone know the
exact quote or where it is from?

And has anyone read any other good stuff about the literalization of
metaphor or the metaphorizatin of the real?

Wasn't it Jack Spicer who said "something like" that, or indicated by what =
he actually DID say, that he would do it, if he could?

I think you are referring to Jack Spicer's riff on lemons and seaweed in one of the letters and/or poems in After Lorca. I don't have the time today to put you to the page. In any case, I think it's best to read that whole book in order to best get a start on Spicer's take. Then, again, that might take years, too.

 Spicer might have been reading Artaud, as well, before writing After Language.

 Enjoy,

Nelson Algren's 99th Birthday Party Set for March 22 at St. Paul's Church

The Nelson Algren Committee steams into its 19th annual Algren Birthday
Party, honoring the great Chicago novelist and essayist, born 99 years ago.
The event is 8 PM, March 22 at St. Paul's Church, 2215 W. North Avenue in
Chicago. Admission is $7, $5 students/seniors, less if you're broke.
Refreshments will be available. Please note the event's new venue.

The party features the Algren Committee Awards, given to those who, like
Algren, unite conscience and creative accomplishment. This year's awards go
to Kari Lydersen, John Conroy and John K. Wilson, three writers at the
forefront of progressive Chicago journalism.

As always, the party blends spoken word, music and video. Poets include
Charlie Newman, Gregorio Gomez, Joe Rorty and Dan Godston, who will read
from Algren's work and their own. Dan Sampson & Friends provide music, along
with the Frankie Machine Blues Band, with John Garvey heading a handful of
fine local blues musicians. Richard Henzel will read from Algren's work.
Videos include the classic Algren segment from the film Goldstein, plus
Warren Leming's "Algren's Last Night" and "The Devil Came Down Division
Street." Additional video will be provided courtesy of BulletProof Film.
Acclaimed photographer/writer Art Shay will discuss his many years of
friendship with Algren and his recent book, Chicago's Nelson Algren.
Previous Algren Award winners will be in attendance.

Nelson Algren (1909-1981) is the author of such definitive works as The Man
with the Golden Arm (winner of the first National Book Award for fiction),
Chicago: City on the Make and Neon Wilderness. He captured the soul of
Chicago, loving it in his own clear-eyed way: "I too wish to defend my city
from people who say it is crooked. In what other city can you be so sure a
judge will keep his word for five hundred dollars?"

Partygoers can mingle among the musicians and memorabilia, including
posters, buttons and DVDs. The birthday party is a chance to honor our
town's literary heritage and experience local artists in the historic
Northwest Side neighborhood Algren made his own.

 The Algren Committee was founded in 1989; founders and early members
included Stu McCarrell, Studs Terkel, Warren Leming, Nina Gaspich, Alice
Prus and Char Sandstrom. At the time, none of Algren's books was in print;
now, partly through the Committee's efforts, all of his work is available.
The Committee has placed a plaque on Algren's former home and dedicated a
commemorative fountain at the triangle of Ashland, Division and Milwaukee.

The party is co-sponsored by the Near Northwest Arts Council. For more
information, the Nelson Algren Committee at (773) 235-4267.

This Sex which is not None


"When I move my eyes, I take account of their movement, without being
expressly conscious of the fact, and am thereby aware that the upheaval
caused in my field of vision is only apparent. Similarly sexuality,
without being the object of any intended act of consciousness, can
underlie and guide specified forms of my experience,. Taken in this way,
as an ambiguous atmosphere, sexuality is co-extensive with life. In other
words, ambiguity is of the essence of human existence, and everything we
live or think has always several meanings. A way of life - an attitude of
escapism and need of solitude - is perhaps a generalized expression of a
certain state of sexuality,. In thus becoming transformed into existence,
sexuality has taken upon itself so general a significance, the sexual
theme has contrived to be for the subject the occasion for so many
accurate and true observations in themselves, of so many rationally based
decisions, and it has become so loaded with the passage of time that it is
an impossible undertaking to seek, within the framework of sexuality, the
explanation of the framework of existence, The fact remains that this
existence is the act of taking up and making explicit a sexual situation,
and that in this way it has always a double sense. There is interfusion
between sexuality and existence, which means that existence permeates
sexuality and _vice versa,_ so that it is impossible to determine, in a
given decision or action, the proportion of sexual to other motivations,
impossible to label a decision or act 'sexual' or 'non-sexual.' Thus there
is in human existence a principle of indeterminacy, and this indeterminacy
is not only for us, it does not stem from some imperfection of our
knowledge, and we must not imagine that any God could sound our hearts and
minds and determine what we owe to nature and what to freedom. Existence
is indeterminate in itself, by reason of its fundamental structure [...]"
(Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception)

It's murky, this being always hinting at structure or organ, somewhere
down beneath the surface (invisible from the surface, from the exterior),
well something's there causing the commotion, a messy engine or drive,
pulsion, a vibration which comes and leaves in fits. Hard to reconcile
with the rest of the chattered world, that boy's got something, that
girl's got something, as if on a day in spring, a ripening, and what does
that have to do with one's place in the cosmos? One begins to discern
structure, a presence or devouring presence or presence to be devoured,
but dimly, a symbol, cupped hands lifting up, you can hold water that way.
The skin holds water, filters it. See, here's the Thing, Being is tawdry,
sad, something to kick around, we can't get to the Universal; Being or
beings make no difference at all, nothing, they're like a pair of socks,
something to run around in. Being or emptiness, beings or Emptiness, we're
talking about ourselves, a local farm, what's temporarily present in the
biome. It's a "region," just as sex-being, being-sex, existence is a
region, a region which is perhaps regional, perhaps not. Carrying organs
and communities within us, and they make all the decisions, separations,
our cries and murmurs, analytics, are regional paste, local determinations
within the inconceivable; our conceptualizations are skitterings. It's a
truism - I talk and write from inside my body. Conceptually, say whatever
you want, this language machine, this computer, goes back to the Acheulian
hand-ax and earlier; tools were always with us, always thrusting into
earth or stem or flesh.

This is why existence is a dead word and sex is not; sex starts inside
something and moves inside something and maybe something else, and
existence, beings and Being, does nothing. Or does nothing outside the
copula; existents reside within the copula, they're chained-linked in our
imaginary which tries to hang on, with the slimmest of threads, to some-
thing that might be considered, not only external (for we sense those, the
scent of the true world), but out there, structure paralleling our own. We
"just" tend to forget the copula, a female or male hand tying a knot
making speaking, these wrytings, possible. Sexuality brings whatever else
there is into the local; my body reflects my body, there's an uncanny
surrounding, insistent on present presence, alterity, imminence, as if
"here" and "there" jump-started one another in the boot-strap model of
existence, powered by sex.

Sexual organs are situated, their effect that of diffusion, existence
diffuses "as far as we're concerned," as far as "we're intended"; it's
that hint of structure, which is somewhat other, messily other, that sur-
faces as abstracted desire-in-language - all these names, desire, libido,
frisson, arousal, id, what have you, and nothing's there, certainly not
existence which seems to be driven by energy, impulse, force, unintended
churning. Why we hardly know what we are. Or rather one might take struc-
ture, as if it could separate from desire, existence, meta-psychology,
meta-physics - one might take structure and make experiment of it. There
are always artifacts, however ephemeral. You get practice out of it,
communication, you can take it to the bank.

You get tangled up when thinking about the organs; it's better to keep
things beneath the covers, much as existence is kept out of sight, out of
our site to be sure. We always mistake the copula for copulation, the
attribute for the thing, the thing for possible worlds, possible worlds
for occurrences, occurrences for Being remote again from the organs; the
true world is the mattering/nattering to and among us, and we have to mess
with the symbolic in all sorts of ways - for example inscription, and then
one form of erasing or another. Not to mention the magic slate, what's
uncanny, what's strange, what estranges us.

There's nothing to say about emptiness but Nagarjuna says nothing anyway.

Dear Lorca, I would like to make poems out of real objects. The
lemon to be a lemon that the reader could cut and squeeze-a real lemon
like a newspaper in a collage is a real newspaper. I would like the
moon in my poems to be a real moon, one which could suddenly be covered
with a cloud that has nothing to do with the poem, a moon utterly
independent of images.

In this way, MarianneMoore (who would later write about the Eliotic qualities of Spicer's"Imaginary Elegies" in her review of Donald Allen's anthology The New American Poetry) becomes both a sampled voice and a mirrored reader throughout After Lorca, in which her poem " Poetry" is reflected and fragmented. Spicer's letter to Lorca about wanting the real to appear in the poem - "Live moons, live lemons, live boys in bathing suits" (After Lorca,34) - echoes Moore's sense of poetry as a "place for the genuine. Handsthat can grasp, eyes that can dilate, hair that can rise, if it must"(40). As if insisting that his poems fulfill Moore's famous demand thatpoems provide "imaginary gardens with realtoads in them" (1, 31; Moore, 41), Spicer breaks the mirroring surfaceseparating life and art with a turbulence repeatedly declared by theintrusion of frogs and splashes within the mirroring surface of a pool,particularly in "Narcissus": "How wide awake the frogs are.
 They won'tstay out of the surface in which my madness and your madness mirrorsitself" (After Lorca, 35).

In his book of poetry, *What He Ought To Know*, Ed Foster makes the same
connection between Jack Spicer and Marianne Moore, suggesting that Spicer
might have gotten the idea from her. Spicer also talks about
"correspondences" in that regard.

Also, is Spicer talking about a flattening of surface which occurs in a
collage when "real" newspapers are introduced in painting?

"If it's not in writing, it never happened."
Ominous "reminder" sign found in various offices . . .
Although, from another point of view, one might also say
"If it's in writing, it never happened . . . "


"Dear Lorca:

This is the last letter . . . "

"Dear Spicer:

This is the last letter.  All day I have been pacing back and forth. trying
to think about this has all meant, wondering how I might say goodbye to
you.  I've been thinking of yo writing to Lorca in a trance, of Lorca
bemused by it all, sending poems to you  for the sheer joy of it from the
grave . . . "
(further excerpts of this letter follow the --always provisional, in
progress--comments here:

One of the most interesting meditations on Spicer and especially After
Lorca, is the way that the figure and work of Spicer make their appearances
interwoven among the other figures and works which inhabit Doubled
Flowering  From the Notebooks of Araki Yasusada.
   Doubled Flowering is in effect, an After Spicer to Spicer's After Lorca,
assembled and annotated by the editors of Yasusada's Notebooks in a manner
suggested by  Yasusada  in a November 7, 1967 letter to his friend Fusei:

     I am so taken by the conception of the book (After Lorca), that I have
decided to correspond with Spicer in a like manner. . . . After I finish, I
will allow him the opportunity to introduce the collection with the same
generosity of spirit that he extended to Lorca . . .

    Since "one knows" that Yasusada is a fictional poet, one finds a
fictional being wanting to correspond with a dead poet, just as that poet
corresponded with a dead poet.  Along the way are "translations" which
themselves are ficions--of Lorca, of Yasusada--framing a discussion of "real
lemons" and "real moons" by both Spicer and Yasusada within the contexts of
fiction, and, in both cases, with correspondances with dead poets.  Fictions
corresponding with ghosts take up the issue of the real, and what makes any
of it "real" is that the poets WRITE of poems which will be real and
independent of images. So real that a cloud which has nothing to do with the
poem will cover that moon.
        And if the moon is that moon which exists in writing--a cloud may
indeed, having nothing to do with the poem pass over it--as it is there on
the page--the moon one literally sees in the four letters which create the
word--a literal cloud may pass overhead and cover it--
      Asked what he meant in his writing, Rimbaud replied, "I mean it
literally and in every sense."  Literally, "m--o--o--n" IS the moon, and
literally a cloud passing overhead could cover the four letters making the
moon seen--THERE--on the page--
        And that "m--o--o--n" is independent of images, and that cloud has
nothing to do with the poem.
         And since from the "after life" Lorca writes with Spicer "After
Lorca," so Yasusada, a fictional "after effect" of his own "After Spicer,"
writes with a Spicer himself now in the "after life."
         As one moves from the moon of Spicer, a "real" poet's moon written
of to a dead "real poet," to the moon of Yasusada, which is a fictional
poet's writing to the now dead "real poet," of the moon he has essayed
creating, the one constant, the one "reality" literally existing among the
historical poets,  ghosts and fictions is this REAL "m--o--o--n" literally
existing on the page from one text to the next.
       The series of "After effects" is a series of echoes re-sounding from
"moon" to "moon" while at the same time literally always being that "same"
"moon".  In a sense, iti s like a rhyming being of moon, the loon--the
"literal" "real" loon calls--and hearing the echo of its call, thinks that
another loon is responding, and so calls back--and again is responded to by
its own echo--to which it in turn responds again--
        The "after effect" of the echoes--creates a "call and response" in
which, though the echoes are not "real" calls from another loon,  elicit a
response in the "real" loon as though its "doubled flowering" really is from
another, who is actually itself and yet--not--
      As, in order for an echo to return, it has to have made contact with
some object, which indeed "sent it back"--to be responded with--
        A literal object like Lorca, like Spicer, off of which Spicer and
Yasusada's calls bounce--and coming back as echoes, are responded with as
though "real" and so, echoing, the moon becomes, IS,  indeed real, as moving
from text to text it continues literally as the written word "m--o--o--n"
and as an echo, an "after effect,"  is also a fiction, the sounds of a
"ghost, "
participating in a call and response with a "real" poet, a fictional poet, a
departed ghost--a real moon existing among "translations" and "letters" and
"really" fully capable of being covered by a cloud which has nothing to do
with any of this.
       (Both Spicer and Yasusada are writing as it were "love letters"
also--

Dear Spicer:

This is the last letter.  All day I have been pacing back and forth. trying
to think about what this has all meant, wondering how I might say goodbye to
you.  I've been thinking of you writing to Lorca in a trance, of Lorca
bemused by it all, sending poems to you  for the sheer joy of it from the
grave . . .

What you've taught me, Spicer, is that the real washes up like a dream from
the unreal.  Thus,  when I say that on a beach against a cliff there is a
boat older than Galilee, it is in the spirit of shellacking words to a page
like objects on a canvas.  A lemon peel, a slice of the moon, two little
girls playing and calling to their father on the beach.  The boat that is
older than Galilee comes into the real, dragging a whole cargo of ghost
history with it.  What you've taught me, Spicer, is that the unreal washes
up from the real [sic, eds] Doesn't the the sound of the burned one drinking
from th ocean make your hair stand on end?

Now here's a thing I've been waiting until the end of our correspondance to
say:  You say you would like the moon in your poems to be a real moon, one
that could be covered by clouds, a moon independent of images.  And you say
you would like to point to the moon, and that the only sound in the poem be
the pointing.  At first I was confused, thinking that you wanted it both
ways.  But now I know  you mean that the pointing and the moon are one.
Like these letters, for instance, which have at their hear an urn, made real
by the facing gaze of two identical ghosts.  An urn wrought by the moon
itself and the sorrowful pointing at it.  Why look any further for the real?
. . .

 No reach through, and place your hand on the papery flesh of this false
face.  And I shall put into my branching voice the ashy sky of your gaze.
Love,
Yasusada

Face/t/ed


He can't get away from the face but doesn't realize it's not hollow, it's
disappearance, defuge. If he would only turn around! But he doesn't, he
thinks he's caught. Kira Sedlock and Foofwa d'Imobilite bring you the
shuddering of a man beside himself within himself, caught by solids.

It's untrue that, being caught, there's nothing catching one; the hard
inertia of substance pins one to the ground. But inscription offers the
last possibilities of play, the last chance to move, walk away from an
anonymous other, not even a thing. Sheave-skin ephemera hardly survive;
sustained by energy input from somewhere else ontologically at variance
with their world, they're wayward, contrary. They don't face anything
else, they never can. I thought of this man once, years ago, in the form
of an iron sphere somewhere in space. I thought something went on inside.

The first lesson I learned was absence. The second was the dream.

Thank you guys!

I am glad that it wasn't Artaud, and that it was Spicer, instead.
Otherwise, all would have gotten really complicated.

I love this idea of the unreal washing up the real [sic]. And these
real and unreal clouds washing over the mo-o-ns.

The final poem in After Lorca is the palindromically entitled

RADAR
*A Postscript for Marianne Moore*

Radar--a word which not only "mirrors itself" --read "backwards and/or
forwards the same"--but echoes itself and is a device & method that finds
objects and beings in movement or stillness by bouncing sounds off of them
and via the echoes--

being able to "see" what is there

much as i wrote of the echoing of sounds among Lorca-Spicer-Yasusada in
which what is seen as there is the moon--

(i expanded a note here from other day and added images--re voyages to the
moon--imaginary, hoaxed, and real or conspiratorial made much as a Melies
film--in Poe, Verne, Melies, Apollo One, Capricorn One and on to Mars and
Waterworld and Reagans' Star Wars--with an "after Rimbaud's Illuminations"
excerpt--& Times DVD set review--
al these echoing words and images--landings real and imaginary--and the
"moon is still there"--

http://davidbaptistechirot.blogspot.com/2008/03/voyages-to-moon-from-poes-hoaxes-vernes.html

loon calls echoing which indicate another there who is at once the echo of
the loon itself--
and of an imaginary other with which it is "corresponding" with  in a call
and response--

as Spicer does with Lorca and Yasusada with Spicer

In "Radar"--
"after" Lorca is gone--
as the final letter to him says--
"Saying goodbye to a ghost is more final than saying goodbye to a lover.
Even the dead return, but a ghost, once loved, departing will never
reappear.
Love, Jack"

there is no longer the echoing effect of the other poet's presence, the
"after effect" of Lorca as a ghost--forever gone--
now the poet's "Radar"--is also gone--(the not knowing exact shapes and
directions of movements in the poem's first stanza)--

and the passing fish jealously eyed by the poet admire the ocean with closed
eyes--
their Radars one thinks--intact--

while the poet gone to bed--alone--("couldn't touch his
fingers")--Radarless---"sees" not the specific forms detailed by the echoed
sounds  of things but the more generalized sounds and shapes associated with
a kind of "stock imagery"--a "poetic repertoire" of "tricks and tropes" that
he's forced to fall back on now that the Magic is gone--"see the splash of
water/the noisy movement of cloud/the push of the humpbacked mountains"--

"Radar" then--
as a postscript--
for Marianne Moore, now that Lorca is gone--
sending out a signal
a PS as SOS perhaps--


here is the poem:

No one exactly knows
Exactly how clouds look in the sky
Or the shape of mountains below them
Or the direction in which fish swim.
No one exactly knows.
The eye is jealous of whatever moves
And the heart
Is too far buried in the sand
To tell.

They are going on a journey
Those deep blue creatures
Passing us as if they were sunshine
Look
Those fins, those closed eyes
Admiring each last drop of the ocean.

I crawled into bed with sorrow that night
Couldn't touch his fingers.  See the splash of the water
The noisy movement of cloud
The push of the humpbacked mountains
Deep at the sands edge.

Preceding the Contents and Introduction of Yasusada's Doubled Flowering is
an "undated entry. in looseleaf, found inserted into a copy of Origuchi
Shinobu's Book of the Dead)

which reads:

In the novel before me there is a painting in a book the protagonist is
reading, in which a woman holds a mirror.  Behind the reflection of her face
is the reflection of a mountain, made tiny by the distance.  i wonder what
she could be thinking, thinks the protagonist, looking up from the book. I
wonder what is happening on the hidden face of that mountain in the mirror .
. .
Where Spicer's "seeing" ends with the push of mountains deep at the sands
edge--

as though a view to the sea-"to see" is obstructed--
 Yasusada picks up from there--"After Spicer"--
and thinks--
what is the hidden face of the mountain?--

"The Bear went over the mountain
to see what he could see"--

to see what sea he could see--
as in the last lines of the last poem , the last entry by Yasusada, in the
Notebooks--


 . . . Tonight
the names will glow quietly on the floating lamps,
and be carried out in clumps
to the sea.  It is because I live
that I pluck a pear and bite
deeply into the hard
flesh.  It is for them, like
the heroes of the Odyssey, rowing
rhythmically past the island of Sirens,
that I pucker my mouth.

And of course, the rowers can't hear the Sirens--but see only--the sea.
Like Spicer's Radar no longer hearing echoes, the rowers hear nothing--

so it is that the two poets--having written their "last letters" to their
loved poets-
redirect their "soundings"--
Spicer to Marianne Moore--
and Yasusada--
to names of the dead floating out to sea--

As quoted before, Yasusada writes of the real in terms of shellacking--

"it is in the spirit of shellacking words to a page like objects on a
canvas."

which is an idea that is very old, usually attributed to Picasso/Braque ca.
1913--in terms of Western "Art"--
though one finds it as early as the 12th century in Japan--in the creation
of text-collages using many different elements--
and in today's Iran (Persia) in the 13th century the use of leather cutouts
for elaborate book bindings and makings--which reached an apogee by the 15
the century, after which incredible work using the elaborate cuttings of
paer was developed and traveled to Constantinople by the 16th century--and
traveling still westward, began to spread throughout Europe at the start of
the 17th century--

in Europe a great many varieties of collage work using real objects--human
hair for example--reached a high degree of sophistication in the 19th
century among the bourgoisie and upper classes, as decorative and domestic
artefacts as well as for the traditional celebrations of religious, state
and sentimental holidays--

the Russian Futurist Zaum books reversed this use of sophisticated materials
in bookmaking by using wall paper samples and anything close to hand--at
once "modern" and emerging from Russian peasant traditions, which especially
influenced Malevich--

some of the most inventive such work in the vernacular is found in the
Americas--in the US--where literacy was a rather adventurous affair for
many--the use of objects and literalized forms representing the functions of
objects were very common--the collaging or assembling together of "junk"
materials to create a mixed language of rebuses, visual puns and
idiosyncratic misspelled words--often spelled in a rough approximation of
phonetics--created a "folk art"--quite at odds with the austerity of the
Cubists--

the questioning of "flattening" is one imposed later on in the sense known
now--as "flattning" has always existed in the arts the world over--
one finds pre-perspective Italian paintings done as a series like comic
books all "flattened out" yet at the same time, through the narrative and
symbolic rush of the imagery "unfolding the (Spiritual) or allegorical
message"--the flattening via a galvanization seems enough but flat, though
it may be literally as flat as any pancake that Clement Greenberg might go
into ecstasies over--

in the Cubists' works one might very well say that what they are adding is
not another form of flatness, but another dimension which extends outward in
space- time from the surface of the canvas--again, a form of galvinization--
the idea is to prompt the viewer to be moving the angles of their vision,
traveling via the directions found via their touching in a continual
shifting of angles--a "relativity" effect like Einsteinian Relativity--

one of the curious things with flatness is that in a "work of art" itis
thought within a certain discourse to be an expression of an "arrival at a
kind of apotheois of the picture plane--

that is, the less there is of any deivation from the most perfect
flatness--the greater the "art" quotient will be--

yet anyone who has worked as at least a begining trained house painter knows
that the secret of the kind of flatness desired in certain sites is such
that the surface will vanish--it is not the PLANE and its flatness that one
wants to have noticed, even as on is painting as flat as flat can be--but
instead the SPACE of the wall--and via its relations with other walls,
ceiling and floor--the space dimensions which can be created by using
flatness as a form of vanishing into extensions, openings outwards, lifting
upwards--and so forth--again, a galvinization--

"flatness" in a sense is something that is imposed mentally onto surfaces
and planes--a kind of "event horizon" in which less and less is supposed to
"happen" in order not to distract from the perception of a mental form of
order--
in a very real sense the drive for ever more flatness and ever less
distraction became a form of discipline and obediance--to an
authority--self-proclaimed--and upheld by the institutions of the artworld--

to paraphrase Emerson, "the blank and flatness we see may be within our
eye"--
in the sense that the eye is trained to look for and appreciate flatness--to
prize a kind of flatness--
to the point where it begins to see as "flat" things which are not--
the "flattening out effect" imposes a kind of of brittle and oppressive
order onto the movement of things through time, in which flattening is
continually being undone--
perhaps in a conformity to flatness at its ever more extreme flatness is the
desire for an erasure of difference , accident, interruption of
contemplation and a sense of visual noise--to arrive finally at a form of
Eternal Rest, or--Eternal Perfect Flatness--

so it depends on how one reads collage elements--if one thinks in terms of
flatness, the elements require a degree of neautrality in them--a
"flattening of affect" and a "binging to a standstill" the unruliness of
things, with their accumulations of associations, alluions, accidental
reminders, dust, dirt and oil streaks of fingers--let alone the quality of
the cutting and the condition of the materials being rendered unto
Flatness--

in a sense Flatness is a form of enforced Death Principle--a yearning for an
unchangeability--an arrival at an apogee--an immense landing strip--
which as Rauschenberg said of of his early "White on White"
paintings--becomes a landing strip for dust--

which earlier had been the "action" of Duchamp's "Great Glass"--hideen away
for years when he had "abandoned paiting"--

yet busily "recording' all the while the accumulations of dust as
measurements of time
 a "flat out" refutation of the "timelessness" of flatness--

in that sense it depends on how one views a work--
training teaches one to "look for" certain elements, to "recognize signs"
and to in a sense not see but read onto--the elements--a pre-set schema--
"seek and ye shall find"--basically a safe journey, without undue adventure,
to "arrive at an understanding"--which has been set up to be waiting for
one--

then there is "another way of looking at it"--in which it is the things, the
elements--which are not imposed upon, but expose themselves--

so elements introduced --may be acting as forms of obediance--on the part of
both "art wok" and the viewer--
or may be instead a questioning of this--
in Spicer's case, i find personally that he works against a flattening--
the radio, the pitcher-catcher baseball analogies, the messages in
Martian--work against a flattening--
sonically creating a multiplicity of signals, transmissions, voices,
languages, idiolects--
whose echo effects and after effects create continuously the seeing of
beings and objects in movements "invisible to the naked eye"--

yet there all the same, just as this "m--o--o--n" which moves through texts
and may be covered by the cloud outside the poem that happens to be passing
by--

which, who knows, may even be Maykovksy's "A Cloud in trousers"--

















What you've taught me, Spicer, is that the real washes up like a dream from
the unreal.  Thus,  when I say that on a beach against a cliff there is a
boat older than Galilee, it is in the spirit of shellacking words to a page
like objects on a canvas.  A lemon peel, a slice of the moon, two little
girls playing and calling to their father on the beach.  The boat that is
older than Galilee comes into the real, dragging a whole cargo of ghost
history with it.  What you've taught me, Spicer, is that the unreal washes
up from the real [sic, eds] Doesn't the the sound of the burned one drinking
from th ocean make your hair stand on end?

Riddle and Dressing for Tibet


'Something for Tibet,' other than petition and money is most likely sense-
less, prayer is senseless, nothing holds against an absolute backed by
what might pass for the inertial power of substance and its ability to
degrade and violate. I might say my heart's in the right place, but who
determines, who knows? So these image/videos are perhaps tantric, that is
my tantric, it's inconceivable that they exist on any register of medita-
tion when I can't hold my own even for a night's proper sleep. In my mind
then these videos lend, one may borrow, as I have, perhaps, and China in
Tibet is inconceivable and now, imminent, control is gone and these are
remnants true but portals.

(I apologize for the slew/slough of videos swallowing texts as they gen-
erate/are generated from their own subconscious (of which I am merely the
catalyst of course). And I apologize for the weight of these videos, which are
detailed to the extent that processing with a quad cpu and gigabytes of RAM
takes two hours per minute just in preview mode. My initial text:

(When things go on limbs from scans of things moving slow.
(When things stand for limbs in communities of narrative.
(When things copulate things petrified they stand still.

(- as scans are attached to bodies, body parts - in other words nodes. A
scan is already a compression begging for wandering as a means towards
diegesis. And so many figures within it!: Foofwa d'Imobilite, Azure
Carter, David Bello, Kira Sedlock and myself - all find their way into
wrapping, merging, hole-filling, shelling, smoothing, fine-tuning - all
for a ragged presence run amuck, wayward, back again with the doubling of
d'Imobilite, Sedlock, Carter and Bello. By the way, these productions use
behavioral filtering - sin to tan for the most part - skittering scans and
the memory of things off to infinity and back again, what happens between
or among frames. (If you've watched any of the recent work, this culmin-
ates the use of .obj files as cloth/ing narrative punctum. If you haven't,
this and this might be the ones to watch. If you have you will see how
these have moved from the other recent movies. Then you can see how
narrative comes from objects close to dreams or deity generation, Tibetan
stem, and nowhere to go but outward through the real.))

David,

"a sense of visual noise"
Wonderful phrase. Is flatness "flat" or is it, as Bill Berkson said, "a gate
[achieved by a] ...complexity of seeing," into a resistant space where the
eye's mind hears noises -needing to be put into "real" words?

For years I have been thinking on Spicer's concept of what words as "real
lemons" might be, his words pulling me in like a Kafkaesque parable.

"  As, in order for an echo to return, it has to have made contact with
some object, which indeed "sent it back"--to be responded with--
       A literal object like Lorca, like Spicer, off of which Spicer and
Yasusada's calls bounce--and coming back as echoes, are responded with as
though "real" and so, echoing, the moon becomes, IS,  indeed real, as moving
from text to text it continues literally as the written word "m--o--o--n"
and as an echo, an "after effect,"  is also a fiction, the sounds of a
"ghost, "

Do you mean that words in an ideal poem imagined by Spicer are real the way
images in a photographs are real? Because both are reflections/echoes of a
thereness, both are real because, as light/thought, they both *touched *real
objects?

In that "touching," does the word not assume, ingest, metamorphose into some
of the essence of that object? It seems to me one must face here the ideas
of essence, of a resistant space, both complete anathemas to the believers
in the absoluteness, the disillusioning reality of flatness and in the
absolute segregation, an mental quarantine so to speak, of the signifier
from the signified?

Ciao,

Murat

they should if transformed  "correctly"  seem as real as possible when
touched by the eye
i would hope that when we write the images we too are seeing them
and that this is hopefully conveyed to the reader's mind's eye
tactility of words visual pomes but not in the sense of visual poetry
i mean they are real because even if surreal we as the crator are making
them real
proust's little cakes taste / touch  descriptive transformation

Subject:      New from Palm Press: The Straits
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Palm Press is pleased to announce the publication of Kristin Palm's =
first book-length collection of poetry, The Straits. Palm, whose name is =
serendipitously similar to that of Palm Press, spent much of her life in =
the city of Detroit, Michigan. Writing a circumnavigation of Great Lakes =
ecology--from the city's center outward--her poems deftly (and with =
difficulty) plumb the citizen-filled wreck of America's most easily =
recognized post-industrial disaster area: Detroit, from the original =
French, De Troit: The Straits. Her book takes as its locus colonization, =
fragmentation, settlement, labor and the human animal through a lens =
squarely aimed at the wreck, ruin and survivance of each.

City, you are a mirror / (nobody's fault / and everyone's)
In The Straits, Kristin Palm presents us with a portrait of the =
mythological city of Detroit. By tracing its construction and =
destruction, Palm invokes the glory and tragedy of America in the 20th =
century. Among Palm's lyric narrative of the names and places, the ruins =
of Detroit represent promise and possibility as a model for urban =
landscapes. The Straits should be required reading for all lovers and =
dreamers of the great American City. -Brenda Coultas=20

The Straits is a Cadillac collection down to its pistons and rims. =
Within these pages, Kristin Palm exhales into the city of accumulation =
(by dispossession) a new Detroit, extending a poesis first laid out by =
Grace Lee Boggs, Tyree Guyton, Cybotron, Lolita Hernandez, and MOCAD. =
Welcome to Detroit, voyeurs-now go home. -Mark Nowak

Child of the so-called "Rust Belt" (moniker denoting a kind of pastoral =
abandonment of Capital's Capacity, instead of a concertedly =
choreographed replacement of its machinery and its train of human =
effects-emotional / intellectual / artistic), Kristin Palm has come =
"back home" with The Straits. But this "return" is a journey outwards =
and forwards. It is for all of us interested in demystifying the =
effective discourses of place around a global-urban nexus. The Straits =
is a poetic investigatory tour-de-force that stands alongside Mark =
Nowak's Shut Up Shut Down as to how "experimental narrative works can =
enter this scene as cultural forces or vectors that provide other =
narrative structures for imagining places and histories.towards a =
cultural imagining of "Another World"" (Jeff Derksen). -Rodrigo Toscano
KRISTIN PALM grew up in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan, and lived in Detroit for =
many years. She currently resides in San Francisco, California. Her =
writing has appeared in LVNG, Bird Dog, Boog City, Chain, There, Dusie =
and the anthology Bay Poetics (Faux Press, 2006), as well as numerous =
magazines and newspapers, including Metropolis, Planning and the Detroit =
Metro Times.=20

<<Dear Colleagues,

Responding to troubled students is not a new topic for creative writing
teachers. By the nature of the craft we teach as creative writing faculty,
we may see, at times, glimpses into the destructive (or self-destructive)
psyches of our students through their stories, poems, and plays.

You may be aware that colleges have seen a sharp increase in students who
arrive with psychological and psychiatric issues. According to the 2006
National College Health Assessment 43.8% of 94,806 students surveyed "felt
so depressed it was difficult to function," during the previous year and
9.3% had "seriously considered suicide" during the year. In addition, in a
landmark study of school shootings, the United States Secret Service
concluded in 2002, that more than one-third of school shooters "exhibited an
interest in violence in their own writings, such as poems, essays, or
journal entries."

While it is true that teachers at any level, and in any subject, might pick
up on troubling signals from a student, it is college teachers in creative
writing for whom the issue is pressing.

The following brief survey (click on the link below) presents an opportunity
for you as a creative writing teacher to respond to the question: The
Troubled Student and Creative Writing: What's a Teacher to Do?

http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=ZBw55nQwNhw5lIj6Pwthcw_3d_3d

I appreciate your response (responses can be anonymous) regarding this
sensitive but critical subject. Collected responses will be instrumental to
a forthcoming presentation and scholarship on this issue.

Thank you for your time and contribution.

Best,

Yes--go, Kates! Kate Schapira is the Kate I know and love best. She rocks! And she runs a great reading series of her own at Ada Books in Providence, RI, if you're in the area. The first year anniversary reading features another of the K8s: Kate Colby, celebrating the release her new book. http://www.ada-books.com/blog.htm

Birthing Homedance, Cross My Heart


Here is the plain description:
*Birthing: male with part-objects of female/birthing attached in anomalous
Freudo-Lacanian space. The shudder, chiaroscuro. With sound. Continuous
birthing with the weight of ruins of things.
*Homedance: male in silent homespace in two parts, first sine, second
tangent. Movement of home is the heart of the male. The home is detached,
Here is a moral: Home, habitus, is an illusion; everything is on the verge
or lip of decathecting. And movement as well is an illusion occasioned by
the hip rooted in camera-vision.
*Crossmyheart: Female with the weight of shattered truth, an illusory
enclosure which topologically transforms according to space and behavior.
Here is the theoretical move:
That of narrative moments which "breathe" without development, mise en
scene or landscape of portents, portals, disturbed behavioral filters
seduced by part-objects and the uncanny.

SWAN DAY, conceived by The Fund for Women Artists, is
a new international holiday that celebrates women
artists. It will be an annual event taking place on
the last Saturday of Women’s History Month (March).
The first SWAN Day will take place on Saturday, March
29, 2008.

The FUND FOR WOMEN ARTISTS (http://www.WomenArts.org)
is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping
women artists get the resources they need to do their
creative work. Its emphasis is on women in film, video
and theatre. Over the past decade it has raised over
$4 million (including a permanent endowment of
$425,000) and built a website that provides
networking, advocacy and fundraising services to
approximately 2000 visitors a day.

WITASWAN (http://www.films42.com/witaswan.asp) is an
informal alliance of women who are using their power
as consumers to increase opportunities for women
artists. It began as an initiative of the Illinois
chapter of the American Association of University
Women.

SWITCHBACK BOOKS is a feminist press publishing poetry
by women. Our definition of "women" is broad and
includes transsexual, transgender, gender queer, and
female-identified individuals. Founded in 2006 by a
group of students at Columbia College Chicago,
Switchback Books publishes two books a year, one of
which is the winner of the Gatewood Prize for a first
book of poetry by a woman aged 18 through 39.
Switchback Books welcomes young women writers who
aren't afraid to look for answers in all directions.

SWAN DAY, conceived by The Fund for Women Artists, is
a new international holiday that celebrates women
artists. It will be an annual event taking place on
the last Saturday of Women’s History Month (March).
The first SWAN Day will take place on Saturday, March
29, 2008.

The FUND FOR WOMEN ARTISTS (http://www.WomenArts.org)
is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping
women artists get the resources they need to do their
creative work. Its emphasis is on women in film, video
and theatre. Over the past decade it has raised over
$4 million (including a permanent endowment of
$425,000) and built a website that provides
networking, advocacy and fundraising services to
approximately 2000 visitors a day.

WITASWAN (http://www.films42.com/witaswan.asp) is an
informal alliance of women who are using their power
as consumers to increase opportunities for women
artists. It began as an initiative of the Illinois
chapter of the American Association of University
Women.

SWITCHBACK BOOKS is a feminist press publishing poetry
by women. Our definition of "women" is broad and
includes transsexual, transgender, gender queer, and
female-identified individuals. Founded in 2006 by a
group of students at Columbia College Chicago,
Switchback Books publishes two books a year, one of
which is the winner of the Gatewood Prize for a first
book of poetry by a woman aged 18 through 39.
Switchback Books welcomes young women writers who
aren't afraid to look for answers in all directions.

I've got a poem going that, currently, suffers from 'nominal fallacy'!
 I don't know if 'nominal fallacy' was on that original list with 'pathetic fallacy' and all the others. But I have been wrong twice so far on getting the name right on this plant/flower combination and I don't want to risk further embarrassment.
 First I put 'lavender blue' pedals on a bottle-brush plant. Only to find it was not a bottle-brush because it was pointed out that such plants only have 'red spiky flowers'.
 Second time through I put 'lilac blue' flowers a ceanothus plant. Which is accurate to such a plant, but it was not the plant. Thank you, Google, for the correcting image!.
 This morning I found the plant with other such plants - some had raspberry and others had deep blue petals (on vertical 6 to 12 inch spiral, flowering 'branches '.)  I asked  a passerby. Ten minutes later she came back in her car. "My husband says it called a 'Candle of Madera' ."  Indeed  the multiple flowering plant looked like an inverted candelabra.
 However, nowhere to be found on Google!
 I and my poor, nominally compromised poem will appreciate an accurate report from a knowledgeable green thumb - if there is one on the premises?

 Thanks in advance, and, as a reward, I will be happy to send a copy of the repaired poem, even post the corrected version on my blog. I would post a jpeg of the culprit on my blog, but the worn-out camera went in for much need repair.

 Honestly, perhaps like Spicer, I am trying real hard to put the real flower in a real poem!

I'm glad to see that this issue is being taken seriously.  I've put together
a short program on the issue:  "Teaching in the Trenches," which I have
presented at a couple of local conferences, with a good response.

Kudos to Ms. Donnelly for the survey and to Gabriel for forwarding it to us.

Subject: fwd: survey: troubled students and creative writing

fyi

<<Dear Colleagues,

Responding to troubled students is not a new topic for creative writing
teachers. By the nature of the craft we teach as creative writing faculty,
we may see, at times, glimpses into the destructive (or self-destructive)
psyches of our students through their stories, poems, and plays.

You may be aware that colleges have seen a sharp increase in students who
arrive with psychological and psychiatric issues. According to the 2006
National College Health Assessment 43.8% of 94,806 students surveyed "felt
so depressed it was difficult to function," during the previous year and
9.3% had "seriously considered suicide" during the year. In addition, in a
landmark study of school shootings, the United States Secret Service
concluded in 2002, that more than one-third of school shooters "exhibited an
interest in violence in their own writings, such as poems, essays, or
journal entries."

While it is true that teachers at any level, and in any subject, might pick
up on troubling signals from a student, it is college teachers in creative
writing for whom the issue is pressing.

The following brief survey (click on the link below) presents an opportunity
for you as a creative writing teacher to respond to the question: The
Troubled Student and Creative Writing: What's a Teacher to Do?

http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=ZBw55nQwNhw5lIj6Pwthcw_3d_3d

I appreciate your response (responses can be anonymous) regarding this
sensitive but critical subject. Collected responses will be instrumental to
a forthcoming presentation and scholarship on this issue.

Thank you for your time and contribution.

Best,

I don't know about Candle of Madera, but I have seen a beautiful blue
flower, much like what you described, in Kolkata, India, in fact, in the
ancientmost British cemetery in Park Street. Its called - APARAJITA, meaning
"unvanquished" (fem.). The name may not serve you well but at least it
brought back those petals for me from a livid past. Memories are our own
lost stockings that often others help find....

Thanks for the jog

If the plant with lavender blue pedals isn't a bottle-brush plant,
perhaps it's a bicycle plant.

What's a poor bad speller to do but make up excuses?
 On tall plants in bloom my eye does a kind of 'pedaling' up and down the petals - a cycling, if you will. If I go up and down both sides of the plant at once, it's a form of 'bicycling.'  But this particular plant, or no plant that I know of, is called a "bicycle plant."
 But,nice try, Herb!

The winner is Carol H. Jewell. Congratulations!
  Thank's to the offered names from others.

  Echium candicans or fastuosum...also known as Pride of Madeira.
 http://daviswiki.org/Pride_of_Madeira

 Though I like the look and sound of 'Echium' (the sound of which fits my 'felt' sense of the blooms), in fixing the poem - for other now inexplicable reasons, I have stuck with "Pride of Madeira".  (No, it's not true - I do not have a race horse of that same name! Though I there was one once).

Hi: are you in California?  I ask b/c ceanothus is largely there.  But =
you're not talking about ceanothus:  an inverted candelebra: is it a =
lupine, which are blooming in CA now:  is it large, 4 to five feet tall, =
with emphatically lobed leaves (spikey, like hands), and upright blooms, =
which are composed of multiple pea-like blooms?  Lupine is in the legume =
family, and its flowers look kind of like sweet-pea flowers on steroids. =
 Happy identifying!

I don't know about Candle of Madera, but I have seen a beautiful blue
flower, much like what you described, in Kolkata, India, in fact, in the
ancientmost British cemetery in Park Street. Its called - APARAJITA, =
meaning
"unvanquished" (fem.). The name may not serve you well but at least it
brought back those petals for me from a livid past. Memories are our own
lost stockings that often others help find....

This information has been offered before, but am hoping might be of
greater interest at this time.

As many of you know, I have been spent the last three years working in
North India's Himachal Pradesh, the lap of Himalaya, engaged in both
community operations and personal odyssey. With the generous assistance
of many, I am currently completing work on a writer's collective (a
community-based center to offer a myriad of educational and technical
services to both Tibetans and non-Tibetans). At present, we are looking
for donations of periodicals and a list of those individuals who might
be interested in contributing their time and expertise to future
programs.

You can contact me with any questions or information. Please, NO money.

Day 19 of The Mobile Novel.

work primarily in the humanities. This year we have joined with the

description of the award.
*
**Poetry Foundation/Newberry Library Fellowship in American Poetry*

Newberry's collections as part of the creative process. The tenure of
the fellowship may be one or two months. The amount of the award is
generally $1600 per month. The fellowship is open to United States
citizens only. Any American */poet/* with a record of publication is
eligible to apply; we welcome applications both from poets residing in
the Chicago area and from those who live elsewhere in the United States.
*/Historians/* or */critics/*/ /should hold a Ph.D. or other terminal
degree or be Ph.D. candidates, and must reside outside the Chicago area.

Here=B9s what=B9s happening at The Poetry Project next week. Maybe we=B9ll see yo=
u
here?



Monday, March 31, 8 PM
Ellen Baxt & Martha Oatis

Ellen Baxt's first full-length book, Analfabeto / An Alphabet, was publishe=
d
by Shearsman Books in June. She has four chapbooks: Since I Last Wrote,
Tender Chemistry, The day is a ladle and Enumeration of colonies is not EPA
approved. Her poetry has appeared in Cross Cultural Poetics / Streetnotes,
How2, the tiny and foursquare, and is forthcoming in the Outside Voices
Younger Poets Anthology. She teaches writing, dance and theater in New York
City public schools. She lives in her hometown of Brooklyn. Martha Oatis is
the author of from Two Percept (Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs) and two
unpublished manuscripts, Forest Trace and Metaphysics Continued. Other poem=
s
have appeared in Aufgabe and EOUGH. She recently began studying Traditional
Chinese Medicine at The New England School of Acupuncture. She lives in
Providence.


Wednesday, April 2, 8 PM
Judith Goldman & DglsN. Rthsjchld

Judith Goldman is the author of Vocoder (Roof Books 2001) and
DeathStar/Rico-chet (O Books 2006). She was a coeditor in the Krupskaya
Collective from 2002 through 2004 and coedits the annual anthology War and
Peace with Leslie Scalapino. She currently teaches at the University of
Chicago, as a Harper Schmidt Fellow. The Poet DglsN.Rthsjchld believes that
you either do or do not know who he is. He does not believe that anyone wil=
l
be convinced to attend his reading based on either the number of books that
he has published or poetry readings he has organized. However, he hopes tha=
t
you will come based upon the recommendations of others. Thus: he says,
without any qualifications, that Bill Luoma, Jennifer Moxley & Anselm
Berrigan would urge you to go. Without a doubt, Pierre Joris, Juliana Spahr
& Steve Evans would agree. Tina Darragh would enthusiastically suggest that
you attend. Neither Ron Padgett nor Ron Silliman would be surprised if you
said you were coming. & Rod Smith might ask you to say hello. Finally, if
you have been convinced by these proposed testimonials, but still wonder wh=
o
DglsN.Rthsjchld is; you have surely seen him, at the New Year's Marathon,
bustling about.

notes (final) for NSF workshop on literature and programming

http://www.alansondheim.org/nsf2.mp4 (large but worth it, an example
of the recent work w/ sync sound - to be played at the beginning of
the talk - apologies for bad compression, but wanted to keep the file
somewhat within reach) (hopefully)

I'll try to keep this short -

i.

I want to generalize writing and coding as _inscription,_ and emphasize
that the world as we know it is already inscribed, encoded and decoded.
The lifeworld isn't analogic and/or mute; it's discrete and presencing.
It's discrete because we deal with symbols in order to communicate; we're
sending signs or tokens back and forth, very rarely the physical objects
of our desire.

One way of thinking about this is in terms of _filtering._ The usual model
of information, transmitter through receiver (with stuff of all sorts in
the middle channel) implies that there is a form of coherency and, if not
comprehension, at least "mutual orientation of cognitive domains," between
sender and receiver. I'd argue that this orientation occurs through
filtering which is always present, fuzzy, and possessing a political
economy of its own (think of Pribram's "retinal knowledge" for example,
the neural processing that occurs in the retina before signals are sent
from the eye to the brain).

Filtering isn't active or passive, inscribed or inscribing, and informa-
tion itself is non-existent, nothing, a form of particulate matter with an
ontology derived from organisms and apparatus.

Once we start (or end) here, "creative" writing splits; on one hand it
becomes _wryting_ - that's spelled with a "y" -a state of material
transformation, transmission, and reception; and on the other, it becomes
malleable, a spew interpreted as symbols. Here is the moment of creative
freedom which also splits - on one hand into or through unbounded, rule-
less 'creative' writing, drawn from an organism's interior - and on the
other, a fuzzy collocation of coding, languages, kludges, protocols, drawn
equally from interior impulse and external restraints (economic, etc.) or
goals that may be transformed in the process of inscription.

(I want to note that in the work I'm doing here at the Virtual Environ-
ments Laboratory, I've been exploring visual configurations or inscrip-
tions, configurations in which spaces, avatars, and objects interact in
uncanny ways, simultaneously malleable and protocol-driven:

Working within the visual and time-based register, static and dynamic
processes blur into one another. We can temporally code a tableau, moving
performers during slow-scan in much the same manner as characters appear-
ing at both ends of a panoramic photograph. We can also move them in terms
of depth, and we can create an interactive diorama in which the viewer
enters and meanders, reconstructing the original sequence of events. We
can also combine a tableau with encoded and restructured motion-capture
behaviors, using avatars or mannequins circulating among the diorama
elements, as "tourists" among ruins - in this manner there are several
interlocking layers of interpretation, the viewer in the midst of them.

With the aid of 3-dimensional laser scanning, we can present abject ele-
ments as if they were interior projections of the "tourists" themselves,
and it's not far from this that the potential for a 4-dimensional reading
or interpreting (seeing, witnessing) of 3-dimensional object _interiors_
occurs. The result is a 5-dimensional manifold as cultural object,
cultural abject. The possibilities for exploration are enormous here, a
kind of pure escapism of dialog, narrative, arousal, creation and
annihilation, in which ultimately nothing happens, no one gets hurt.

So this leads to another direction I'll just mention briefly - thinking of
creative writing as a kind of inscribing in any medium at all. We can then
talk about creative inscription, creative coding, whatever, emphasizing a
"new media" approach to all of this, rather than thinking of electronic
literature, e-literature, interactive writing, etc.)

To misquote the physicist David Finkelstein, one might consider program-
ming as fucking with/in a universe of abstracted ontologies, and creative
writing as masturbation-fantasy, moving just about anywhere, anywhen. Both,
however, have inscription and filtering in common and neither presents or is
pure 'presence' within the world. On the other hands, both meander among
rules, although with differing obeisance, and both have, at their core, a
freedom that is as absolute as anything gets.

How can this be useful pedagogically? In terms of creative writing, the
answer is, I believe, to think of texts as both intentional, cohering, and
as material objects which are always already filtered; this leads to
thinking about filtering and different forms of filtering as creative
writing practice. In terms of programming, not being a programmer (but
working with programmers), I'm not sure; I'd argue that, for an outsider,
filtering appears at the interstices or liminal spaces between program and
framework (inputs, outputs, interfaces, hardware (in the traditional
sense, and in the sense of information-laden substance), and so forth).
And I'd want to look at the phenomenological horizons of programming, not
only through this filtering, but also within programs and programming in
general: Where is the programmer in the midst of her subroutine? And where
is the freedom then/there?

I do want to note one final thing here - that I'm placing too much empha-
sis on specificity, the discrete. One of the directions I've been explor-
ing at the VEL is to consider the _abject,_ which remains indeterminate
and close th analogic substance - something "gooey," not "GUI," for
example. It's here that we humans can explore the world which refuses
discrete curtailment, which abjures communication.

ii.

Some parallels between poetry and code (very underdeveloped section)

1. Both treat language as a material with "additional," even surplus,
structure in relation to presumably normative prose. In other words,
poetry works with tropes such as rhyme, rhythm, "resonance," metaphor,
metonymy, etc. - all the devices of rhetoric that appear linguistic
"material" - acoustic or page/screen/etc. - on a meta- or abject- level,
just as codework works with protocols, elements extraneous to the surface
meaning, but inextricably entangled with it.
2. Both are "writerly" texts in the sense that, in order to read them,
additional work (meta, interiority) is required that's not required of
standard prose.
3. One might say that standard prose possesses subtexts in the sense of
"underlying meanings" that encompass paragraphs, chapters, entire works -
while the subtexts of codework and poetry are also on the level of letters,
words, sentences, and so forth. I remember the Mirror of Composition saying
that "A poem is a sentence with flavour." (rasa). That applies.
4. On a practical level, the communities of practitioners intersect -
Vincent Cerf has poetry in the RFC, there are Perl poems, and there are
poets who work through concepts of programming, such as Catherine Daly.

with Deidra Greenleaf Allan, Daniel Godston, and Cris McCreary,
at Robin's Bookstore in Philadelphia

6 p.m. on Friday, April 18

Deidra Greenleaf Allan
Deidra's interest in poetry began early. She wrote her first poem at the age
of 8 and submitted her first poem to the New Yorker at the age of 17.
Needless to say, soon after, she received her first rejection.
In 1997, after more than 20 years of doing professional writing and public
relations, Deidra returned to her creative roots. Taking a leave of absence
from work, she attended Vermont College, where she completed her MFA in
January 2002.
In 2001 she was selected as Montgomery County Poet Laureate in a competition
judged by Robert Hass. Also that year, she received a Leeway Emerging Artist
Award and was nominated by Vermont College for the Modern Poetry Association
's Ruth Lily Fellowship. In 2002, she was a finalist for a Pew Fellowship in
poetry.
Her poems have appeared in American Poetry Review, Aurelian, Mad Poet's
Review, Poetry Miscellany, Puerto del Sol, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the
Arts, West Branch (fall 2007), and Wind Magazine.

Daniel Godston
Daniel Godston teaches at Snow City Arts Foundation, The Center for
Community Arts Partnerships, and at Columbia College Chicago. His writings
have appeared in Chase Park, Versal, Drunken Boat, 580 Split, Kyoto Journal,
Eratica, Moria, after hours, and other print publications and online
journals. His poem "Mask to Skin to Blood to Heart to Bone and Back" was
nominated by the editors of 580 Split for the Pushcart Prize. In February
2007 he curated the Forth Sound Back event, in the Red Rover Series. He
works with the Borderbend Arts Collective to organize the Chicago Calling
Arts Festival.

Chris McCreary
Chris McCreary is co-editor of ixnay press (www.ixnaypress.com) and the
author of two books of poems, Dismembers and The Effacements. He has
reviewed poetry and fiction for venues such as Rain Taxi, Review of
Contemporary Fiction, and The Philadelphia Inquirer, and he teaches English
at a private high school in the Philadelphia area.

	+ rob mclennan

This issue comes out of an informal writing/social group that the four of
us (all, but for myself + Lainna, completely unaware of each other
previously) started within weeks of my arrival in Edmonton, coming
together slowly from mid-September, 2007. The title makes reference to a
previous publication of four poets in roughly the same format, in by one,
out by four (suggesting just how quickly the little publication was put
together) in Edmonton in 1980, featuring the poetry of then-Edmonton poets
Douglas Barbour (the only one still here), George Melnyk (now in Calgary),
Monty Reid (now in Ottawa) and Stephen Scobie (now in Victoria, BC). This
little publication is dedicated to them -- rob mclennan, March 08, Edmonton
AB..

Jeff Carpenter is currently acting as Acting Director of the Alberta
Research Group. National Anther is a sequence of acrostics using ten lines
from Michael Palmers First Figure (1984). Several other constraints were
built in to play off the book/folio form whilst riffing off some unlikely
couplings from Canadian literature (and beyond). Reading aloud exercises
tongues and lungs and minds Is. Fast as you can. *** Trisia Eddy lives and
writes in and around Edmonton, Alberta. Her work has been broadcast on
radio, and has appeared both online and in print, most recently with
ditchpoetry.com, Perspectives Magazine, Existere, and fait accomplit. She
is the founding editor of red nettle press, which released her chapbook,
what if there's no weather, in 2007. An upcoming series of red nettle
poets is set to be released in 2008. *** Lainna Lane has lived in Ottawa,
Vancouver, and most recently Edmonton where she is very slowly completing
her English and Comparative Literature degree at the University of
Alberta. She finances this by working in an office tower guarded by
peregrines. When not in office or school she enjoys traveling, working at
Other Voices literary magazine, playing dodgeball, and mixing a mean mint
julep. She has one publication in this year's student edition of the Olive
Reading Series chapbook. *** rob mclennan is the beginning and the end (or
something); the author of thirteen trade poetry titles, he is the author
of a novel (white, The Mercury Press) and two non-fiction titles (Ottawa:
The Unknown City, Arsenal Pulp; subverting the lyric: essays, ECW Press),
and will be launching another on the University of Alberta Bookstores
espresso book machine in late May. He is (and was) the 2007-8 writer in
residence at the University of Alberta in Edmonton

forthcoming in May; The Peter F. Yacht Club #11, Edmonton issue part two...

Just wanted to announce to the list a new poetics enterprise,
whose institutional home is the University of Notre Dame.

Mission Statement:

Latino Poetry Review (LPR) publishes reviews, essays and interviews
with an eye towards spurring inquiry and dialogue. LPR recognizes
that Latino and Latina poets in the 21st century embrace, and work
out of, a multitude of aesthetics. With this mind, its critical focus
is the poem and its poetics.

  *Twine of Armagedom(7/7/1977)*

Pra trip start
Necessary to present me
I am poet of the destination
A history I go to count
Of the War of the Armagedon
That to the world it goes to transform...

I sing the war in the impulsivity
End of the times to arrive
The malice of the serpent
It comes a crossbow of air
Control of the Thought:
Men to enslave...

The war always existed
Of the cave to the airplane
The man always fought
For a false reason
Destroying the fellow creature
For pleasure and passion...

I remake the vision of the Apocalypse
Of the prophet They are Jo=E3o
The city of the redeemed ones
The muse of the salvation
The cradle of the eternity
The glory of the perfection...

The prophecies if fulfill
It would be good that it was felt
The prophets had predicted
Nostradamus well that it said
Of Patmos it augured
The man of the Apocalypse...

He trembles the Land, moans the People.
In tremendous desventura
Earthquake in all part
It increases the temperature
The terror makes the currency
In it takes them to the sepulture...

The time worries me
It is hour of meditar
It will come a great comet
Everything to illuminate
A meteor rain
It stops in rightening them...

Grasshoppers will attack
Bacteriological war
Virus, fungos and illnesses.
E technological plague
The War of the Armagedon:
In it settles psychological...

Guerra-=D3dio and bitterness
Disaster and destruction
The Terror invades the Land
Generating fear and affliction
The War of the Armagedon:
It will be the Great Question...

It is not said in Poetry
Corruption is only seen
Children disrespect the parents
Prostitution grows
It commands the Dictatorship:
With torture and repression...

The people to pass hunger
The misery is total
In all part of the Land
The disaster is general
The oil always goes up:
Everything is exactly different...

Plague =96 illness and disease
Earthquake to shake
All the globe
It starts if to flood
Tidal wave and hurricane:
Much people to kill...

They reign be$tas powerful:
The man to govern
He comes the American crossbow
To control land and sea
Allied of Sat=E3:
He makes the war to prosper...

The problems are giant:
It is nation against nation
Everybody is in the fight
In The Great Rebellion
It orders the crossbow of the sin:
It bewitches the Multitude...

Books will be forbidden
War against the Isl=E3o
Desvirtuaram the Bible
In The New Inquisition:
Conflicts in the East:
Iraq =96 Afeganist=E3o...

The man is restrained
If he cannot be brother
The forbidden truth:
The confusion will be great
Pra to buy or pra to vender:
It has that to have numeration...

The god of long ago died:
Everything now is different
"Viva the Man of the Pecado":
I hear the voice of poor people
They adore an Emperor:
E the crossbow of the President...

They will create an order
All have to respect
To adore the Satan
Pra to live and pra to buy
Who will not have the signal:
It does not need nor to pray...

The Land in the great pain
Who will be able in saving them?
The exploration is great
The poor person to massacre
The mentally ill people:
The image to adore...

Imperial cold war
Of Russian and American
Conflict... espionage
Much fear and deceit
The profit and more the value
It brings to the man much damage...

It does not exist communist
Democrat was not born
The human being is dictator
It only thinks about the one that is its
Consumerism and power:
Our man if lost...

The Truth is imprisoned
Born in the kingdom the hypocrisy
The lie is the currency
It commands would putaria it
He is all endiabrado:
Mismanagement in the orgia...

People of changed sex
Man capsizing woman
She is woman who turns man
William that turns Ester
In woman who was male:
Who goes to put the spoon.

Man with married man
On cangote and foot
Pra has tare all side
It has Maria that it is Z=E9
E has Z=E9 that she is Maria
Already t=F4 being lel=E9...

Casino for all part
Lottery and thousand
Everything is diversion here
Game of the animal and bad luck
The increasing unemployment
It makes the people if to capsize...

The rich ones are richer
Much people to steal
They defalcate our State treasury
Without binding for bad luck
They explore the day all
Treasure to increase it...

More truth does not exist
Demagogy is only seen
The Terror to detonate
Day and night... Night and day...
The corruption reigns
The Democracy blows up...

The misery if exaggerates
The hunger if multiplies
The poor person is in the dance
Each time more is complicated
Nobody league for the people:
In this life of titica...

The moment is fond
Of the great desolation
The crucial battle:
An insane person confusion
The War of the Armagedon
It is chaos and destruction...

The world is with fear
To face the weather
The man is lost
In The Capital Sin
He corrupted the heart:
Here it is there the great evil...

Nobody fears the future
Nor it looks the Reason
The Love was buried
It is lacking the bread
It is only desired to be able
In this world of illusion...

The mismanagement commands
The State is sick
Freedom alone goes to have
Pra if to adore $erpente
The desumano system:
It oppresses, it kills and it has lain...

The Great Empire started
Kingdom of the destruction
Of the deceit and the misery
Fear and profanation
The man is lost
In the way of the solitude...

Estopim was lighted
Back in the bands of the Isl=E3o
In the Ir=E3 of the Ayatola:
Iraq =96 Afeganist=E3o
Palestine and Israel
In India and Pakistan...

The days are counted
For the old Joined Kingdom
The American Empire
It prepares its moan
The Soviet Empire
That also he will be looser...

"comunismo" dies old;
To be depleted for the world
The War of the Armagedon
It will have deep boom
The Light will survive:
The dirty being will die...

The War of the Armagedon:
The intervention of Miguel
Persecution to the Isl=E3
Conflict with Israel
Palestinians in berlinda
In the land of milk and honey...

It forgot the salvation
Brazil was chosen
Pro end of the religion...

A world-wide collapse
Because of the energy
False prophets promise
Peace, pureness and harmony.
It is the Kingdom of the Antichrist:
The crossbow of the hypocrisy...

The great prostitute appears
Babil=F4nia, the great muse.
The chaos if spreads in the Land
The multitude is confused
Sorve the goblet of blood:
That Besta-Fera U.$.A

It is lived confusion

The egoism is tyrannous
It makes the man to fight
To use the knowledge
Pra to exclude and to kill
It imprisons the freedom
It takes off the other of the place...

The war appeared so soon
To the world the man came

The ferina fight appeared
Breaking everything in the way...

The armament was uncovered

With hatred and oppression...

We walk pro uncertain

It is the voice of the prophecy
In revelation time
Of the cabal=EDstico mystery
Of the prophet They are Jo=E3o
It is the principle of pain

The capital makes the war
Dilacera the love

Torture with its pain
The Devil in deceives them
With its air of treasonous...

The ogives to be danced
Bacteria in air
The fungos and mushrooms
They make the robot to cry
In the War of the Armagedon
The man goes to changed itself...

a fascinating article
Re the recent discussion of Literalization of Metaphor--
here again, except literally, the French "beat the Americans to the moon"
(although Poe had been there first including the hoaxed versions thereof)--
this is a fascinating and literal idea of the phono-graph as literally a
sound-writing--
a machine which doesn't record sounds, but transcribes them, much as the
inventor's own text on stenography conceives of that skill as doing--

in this case, with the phonautogram, one has BOTH writing and speech
"materializing" at the same time--
the DIRECT transcription via sound waves of the notation of speech and
song--

via machine rather than human hand--
creating a standardized and easily reproduced "phonautogram"--


also--re another aspect of writing:

Broadband Borders

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/opinion/29sat4.html?_r=1&th&emc=th&oref=slogin---

something else re writing discussed here has been the internet as
"democracy" and "avant garde" which  i continually see and write of the
Internet moving in opposite direction from the democratic in terms of who
has access to it--
here in Milwaukee the poorer the city gets, the farther behind in Internet
access in libraries and public places, as well as fewer people being able to
afford access, and in many cases now, people having in the winter to choose
between heat or electricity--

even Internet access in libraries and schools is limited to an hour or less
at a time--and that access in itself is limited--

what i call the Invisible Wall of cut off of electricity and Internet
access, of cable and phone lines, at one extreme is a way of isolating
peoples in order to carry out exterminations as was done in Rwanda or ethnic
cleansing as in Iraq, Gaza, Afghanistan or control of unrest as in Burma and
at the other is along the ancient and time honored lines of separation of
the classes--the ruling classes have access to the information and exchange
of culture, while those "below" them do not--that way, their "betters" can
make the decisions for their "less fortunate" brothers and sisters--

increasing privatization of the public sphere promotes systems of inequality
and "paves the Internet highway" so to speak for  E-versions of Katrinas
creating electronic "internal refugees" as New Orleans produced a flood of
persons across the landscape as "internal refugees"--

one can imagine futures--not to mention many current Presents-- -of gated
communities, Green Zones, settlements and outposts, walled off from the
slums, with their privatized security forces, and their privatized access to
cable,  satellite and phone lines--the surrounding areas will have only
minimal electrical lines for lighting--to be controlled by the security
forces--of privatized local governments run by corporations and
investors--or by military-corporate-state entities--

jump to the point

Sheave skin / carapace like leather illustrating theoretical talk. I'm
sick of the human form. It jumps from one reading to another; it recep-
tion is too automated, too buried. It's far too familiar, too vulnerable
to defuge, over-cathecting, decathecting, arousal, hormonal secretions,
reflex archaeology of fear, flight, violence, love, imprinting, fetishiz-
ation. It's brutal; it catalyzes behavioral repertoires - states jump
catastrophically from one to another. It's as if there's no abjection or
no abjection worth talking about (you can't talk about abjection). I'm
sick of abjection, sick of steamy sleazy squeamed-space; its liminality
depends on the body and what's taken for its (sickening) normative form.
Bend it, twist it, otherwise transform it - the elements always assert
themselves, our eyes betray us into false familiarity. So here goes again
another variation just as almost every story is variation on bodies
through time, bodies squawking, squealing, mewling, talking, yakking,
yacking, yapping, humming, singing, whatever bodies do, I guess cry,
weeping, laughing. There's only somewhat bodies do; there's only somewhat
subjects see.

I'm sick of the discourse of bodies, fluids, war, violence, arousal, sex,
secretion, membrane, excretion, effluvia, defuge, liquidity, the damp and
scent, the odor and smell, wound, carapace, tissue, flesh, scar, pain;
what more could possibly be said, recast, transformed, transfused, in-
fused, written and rewritten, wrytten - in fact or fancy, inscription or
symbol, mark or token, analog or digital, subject or object, fissure or
sinter, sign or image, imaginary or imaginary? It goes on and on, struc-
ture and substructure, text and subtext, mathesis and semiosis, substance
and process, state and operator. It never breaks out; it can't break out,
it's all their is, even inscription goes on within it, emptiness goes on
within it, tantra goes on within and without it, analogic and metonymic,
metaphoric and contrary: discrete and the wound of nothingness.

So again it's trying to talk, trying to assemble, to dissemble, trying to
_seem,_ trying to walk-talk in airless space, in dimension-five space, in
slice-of-death. It's trying to tell us something, we're too bored to care,
too inundated to listen, too lost for comfort: we're the dis of dis/ease,
dis/comfort, dis/semble, dis/crete. Bodies churn, worlds are minimal, true
world is all there is, is there.

http://www.alansondheim.org/nsf2.mp4 new file w/old name, amazing

Stretched faces, I'm sick of stretching, I can't face them, you see the
faceless, you'll make something out of it, you'll make something with it,
you'll make something of it. I'm done with it, it's done with me, it's the
same old story that's the same old story, it's the other, there's none
other, there's nothing accountable, it's unaccounted-for, unaccountable,
uncountable, it's abject, I'm gone, I'm out of here, I'm lost in it, I'm
lost in you, I'm lost in them, I'm outside looking in, I'm inside looking
out.

INSEPARABLE collects poems written between 1995 and 2005 by the New =20
York poet, editor and novelist Lewis Warsh. Strongly identified with =20
New York since the 1960s, when he co-founded Angel Hair Magazine with =20=

Anne Waldman, Warsh makes poems from the city=92s linguistic fabric, =20
interwoven with a bemused real-time interiority. The 35 poems in this =20=

collection are pitted with reminiscences made approachable to the =20
reader by their lack of self-absorption; it is the momentum of the =20
will to persist by means of language--=93moving, word by word=94--against =
=20
the incipient flickerings of mortality, that is the real logic. This =20
act of self-propulsion may be subject to doubt (=93Can we spend our =20
lives feeding/off simple endurance?=94), but it is humbly pursued. =20
Warsh resists the inflated rhetoric such preoccupations usually =20
attract and sticks instead with (in the words of Clark Coolidge) =20
=93confusion, in strict order.=94

Analogy


"The most important analogy of all is that of affiliation: the candidate
should affiliate his body, speech, and mind with the Body, Speech, and
Mind of the Buddha, called the three mysteries. According to Mkhas grub
rje, it is this affiliation which establishes the superiority of the
Diamond Vehicle (the Tantras) over non-tantric Buddhism. One affiliates
his body by gesture (mudra), his speech by incantation (mantra) and his
mind by deep concentration (samadhi). Mkhas grub rje's Fundamentals...
states, 'In the Kriya and Carya (Tantras) one intensely contemplates the
body as Great Seal (mahamudra), speech as Incantation (mantra), and mind
as Reality (tattva). This is the 'Quick Path' because all avenues of the
being are operating for a common goal: the body, speech, and mind are not
working at cross purposes.

In such a case, we might say of body, speech, and mind, what Arya-Sura
wrote in his Jataka-mala in description of King Sihi (but in his case
meaning the three types, kama, artha, and dharma). [...]

'In him all forms having multitudes of virtues consistent with the three
types appeared with common residence as though from merger of rivalries,
and they had no loss of brilliance due to opposition and commotion.'

In Hinduism it is believed that these three types when in harmony yield
the fourth one, liberation (maksa)."

(Alex Wayman, Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra, The Arcane Lore of Forty
Verses, A Buddhist Tantra Commentary, Motilal Banardsidass, 1990.)

(perhaps unlike software/programming) in my work, there are no errors,
only creative commotion on the lip, edge, or brink; there are repertoire
extensions to be sure; analogy dissolves; commotion is brilliance; what
dissolves is nothing whatsoever; what's left is nothing whatsoever; in the
airless realm; in the unintended or intentionless realm; in the true world
and the breaking of intention and the intended; in annihilation already
foregone or future anterior; in the blank of the afterthought of the alpha
channel; in mind noh-mind no-mind; in mindless speechless air; in no-body.

Hi all! although this is a poetry listserv, I thought that many of you might
be innovative prose writers as well. In addition, if you know any prose
writers looking for some editorial experience, you might forward this call.

21 Stars Review is looking for a prose guest editor for our next issue. Our
current prose editor is currently swamped with all sorts of outside work &
would like some help with reading & selecting subs. Here is our submission
info:

*We have a strong leaning toward work that uses constraints, innovative
meter and form, or carefully executed collage/cut-up techniques. Prose with
amazing sentences will be preferred over prose with unamazing sentences.
Plotless or intricately- plotted very short fiction (ideally under 1000
words) is also something we enjoy.

*If you think that you are interested in being a prose editor for our
journal, please send a short bio & list of publishing credits to
prose21stars@gmail.com, Please send all notes of interest to
prose21stars@gmail.com, not to me directly.
Thanks,
Letitia T

If anyone has had a collection (poetry or prose) that's been translated
and published in Europe before US publication in English AND would be
willing to correspond about that experience, could you please
backchannel?

A friend had a story translated into Italian (high quality work that was
dead on, even preserving the mood and lyricism of her original
words)--the translator is suggesting she publish the entire collection
in Italian.

Ana Bozicevic-Bowling suggested that we look around the
http://www.authorsguild.org/ site which I have passed along already.

Thanks in advance,
Deborah

From David Orr's review of Mary Jo Bang's "Elegy" . . .

"The poet doubts the redemptive power of her own gift while
simultaneously using it to find a tone that =97 in the final line =97
wavers perfectly between her contempt for consolation and her desire
for it. The achievement of art shows the limitation of art, and vice
versa. This is the great strength of "Elegy." No one will ever bring
back the dead by writing poetry; indeed, the only certain result of
writing a poem is the poem itself. But as Bang proves in this sad,
strange book, the conversion of grief into art may be balanced, if not
redeemed, by the transformation of art into grieving."

Notice yet another New York Times review suggesting that language
poetry is hegemonic. Mary Jo

"That confrontation can be especially problematic for a certain type
of contemporary poet. Stevens accused Frost of writing about
"subjects," to which Frost retorted that Stevens wrote about
"bric-a-brac." The dominant contemporary American style, with its
self-conscious intellectualism, evasiveness and preoccupation with
"language itself" is firmly on the side of bric-a-brac. This style,
like all styles, may be put to any use, but it will always approach
its goals through the backdoor via head fakes, double bluffs, rope
tricks and an elaborate system of pulleys. It's a strategy poorly
suited to "subjects" in general, let alone the intractable subject
that haunts an elegy."

This is a respectful invitation to visit my blog:

  The first pieces on the blog are short essays about gay sex in Bangkok.  Besides that, there are dozens and dozens of prose poems, stories and short essays.  Poke around a little?

  I'm a writer living in Japan, born in the U.S, in love with India, and about to move to Italy.  A gay guy educated at Naropa, the School of the Art Institute, as well as numerous monasteries, ashrams, bathhouses and sex clubs.

  I would be very grateful to correspond with anyone who writes about sex, Buddhism, Japan or India.  I would be tremendously grateful for reading lists or advice of any sort.  I am, admittedly, a machine for the creation of rough drafts.  If you have advice on how to proceed, how lucky I would be!

than 20 years of practice, to create a last
performance.

Hello all, just a reminder:

Evan Munday at Coach House has generously put together a launch to
celebrate the release of the first Open Letter issue, the release of
bpnichol.ca, and the publication of The  Alphabet Game. It should be a
really fun night and it would be wonderful to see some of you in
person.

Below are the details for the event and the flyer is attached - hope
to see you there and please do forward the announcement to anyone you
think might be interested in coming.

best, Lori

April 2 =96 We're bringing NicholBack
Literary event at Supermarket celebrates three new pieces of
Nicholmania from late Canadian author bpNichol

'His wit, along with the seriousness, was there to keep the language
free and untethered, to keep the poem aware of its roots, like a
tuxedo worn with bare feet in a muddy river ... No other writer of our
time and place was so diverse, attempted so much, and never lost sight
of his intent.' =96 Michael Ondaatje

A member of the sound-poetry performance group The Four Horsemen,
winner of a Governor General's Award for Poetry and writer of Fraggle
Rock, bpNichol was one of Canada's most important writers. Nichol was
the author of countless publications in a variety of forms, including
poetry (lyric, concrete, visual, sound). He was known as a promoter of
poetry and the small press, a manipulator of the lines between genres
and a prolific Canadian word artist, and they even named a Toronto
laneway after him.

In late 2007, Coach House Books published The Alphabet Game, edited by
Darren Wershler-Henry and Lori Emerson, a selected reader of Nichol's
work designed as an introductory overview to Nichol's texts. This
spring, Canadian literary criticism journal Open Letter publishes the
first of two new bpNichol-focused issues, and the long-awaited
bpNichol site, bpnichol.ca, is unveiled. The spring also sees the
release of Brian Nash's bp: pushing the boundaries on DVD.

To celebrate, Coach House Books, Open Letter and bpnichol.ca present
NicholBack, a stellar night of Nichol performances.
