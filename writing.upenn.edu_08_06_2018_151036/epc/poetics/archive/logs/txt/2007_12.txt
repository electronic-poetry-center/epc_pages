Verge, the debut collection of poems by Morgan Lucas Schuldt, is now availa=
ble from Free Verse Editions at
http://parlorpress.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=3D170

Here's what some poets are saying about the poems:
In the tradition of Jacques Roubaud=92s Some Thing Black and Stan Brakhage=
=92s The Act of Seeing with One=92s Own Eyes, Morgan Lucas Schuldt=92s Verg=
e
is a concise and unsettling ride along the boundary between life and
death. Through careful lyric gestures and Joycian guttural utterances,
Schuldt=92s poems linger at the verges of the body and the breath, all
along reminding the reader that the language of poetry depends upon our
=93meat-leased=94 fragile corporeal forms.  =97Lisa Jarnot With its ceasele=
ss invention, root-play, and wit, Morgan Lucas Schuldt's Verge paces a vaul=
ting "overtakelessness."  It is a fast shining careen, affirming "meanings =
sing us" in its swervings.  =97Karen Volkman For
a book of beautiful sounds, this book knows many things. It knows that
in our engagement with mortality, joy and what we are "merely" must win
out over all of the seductive illusions. Schuldt writes his way into
the poetic record through a rich lexical pond (Hopkins, Woolf, Celan).
Here phonemes break to refine, twist to fly. =97Barbara Cully

I think it's one of the best films I've ever seen, certainly U.S.-made (I already knew that Haynes was the best U.S. filmmaker). Every shot is thoughtfully, beautifully composed, and the acting is magnificent.

It's surprising, on this list of all places, to find comments treating the film as if it's a Dylan bio. It is partially that, of course, but it's structured more like a Dylan song than a biography--almost a verse-like nature to the different sections. Characters closer to and farther from the tenuous "reality" recur or drift in and out; just as in the songs, bits of the outside leak in: not only the extra-cinematic outside (the war, Nixon, SoCal born-again culture) but the cinematic outside (Fellini's and Godard's work of the same period as "Blonde on Blonde" as well as the Beatles' "Help," but also the traces of Fassbinder that are always visible in Haynes' work) and the "outside" of 20th-century American mythologies (the hobo and labor stories, etc.).

The richly deserved praise for Cate Blanchett misses the point in its exclusive focus on the most literally biographical thread in the film (it should be a hint that even her character gets a fictional name, one that combines Quinn the Eskimo with Jude (Judas)). The movie takes Dylan's own repeated reinvention of himself in accordance with his most beloved myths as a structural basis that it expands to a larger scale, reinventing the reinventions themselves (so that Gere's Billy the Kid is also Dylan from the motorcycle accident to the present, socially reclusive (even on an endless tour); the actor character is a literalization of Dylan's treatment of previous personae as mere puppets, laying bare his narcissism, selfishness and exhaustion by embodying them as a character; "Arthur Rimbaud" is a series of aphoristic Dylanisms drawn out by strange interrogators).

One of my favorite aspects of the film is its self-consciousness about quotation (from Dylan's interviews and songs and from other films, as well as--especially--of all sorts of American archetypal stories) and artifice, without any of the postmodern irony, the "fear of actually meaning it," one finds in a lot of self-conscious contemporary narrative art.

There's simultaneously a  "hands-off" aspect to the presentation (the gorgeous surreal naturalism of the Gere sequences and the church scene that's allowed to speak for itself, without any Christopher Guest-style condescension) and an acknowledgment of the fact and power of telling--a way of presenting that amplifies strangeness while simultaneously acting as if it is, or might as well be, perfectly realistic.

My three cents.

--Andy

My poem 'Carrier of the Seed' is now out as a free ebook with Blazevox. The=

Jake Berry: =E2=80=9CExcellent, mythopoeic, my kind of stuff.=E2=80=9D
Marjorie Perloff: =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s very striking. The reader is propel=
led forward, thematically and mythologically. The result is extremely inter=
esting.=E2=80=9D
Hank Lazer: =E2=80=9CAn engaging avalanche of a poem, and I like the collis=
ion of various registers of language throughout the poem.  Overall, a feel =
of contemporary myth-dream propelled narrative to it.  A truly contemporary=
 quest.=E2=80=9D
John M. Bennett: =E2=80=9CSay, this is an excellent piece.=E2=80=9D

Some of this is, of course, a matter of taste -- I confess that to date I
haven't liked anything by Haynes -- I didn't like his ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS
and I thought the beautifully shot homage to his own film that appears in this
film was rather silly --

Part of the problem for me is that being "structured like a Dylan song" isn't
really the problem -- the problem is literalizing what Dylan does -- this
didn't work well in Masked & Anonymous and it doesn't work well here, for me --
Rather like that Voices and Visions TV series years ago in which they'd read a
poem by Frost and show you a New England wood pile -- geez, you think it's a
metaphor?  deep!  In M&A (and in the Gere section of this film) it's as if
they'd made a movie of the cover of the official Basement tapes --

Brakhage films, I'd say, are structured like songs --

and I'd still say that EAT THE DOCUMENT does a better job of this (and works as
well if you forget Dylan even exists as an actual person) --

but I recognize that in this instance mine is a minorty opinion -- most critics
seem to like it -- most critics liked CRASH and HUSTLE & FLOW (to name two very
different films I couldn't abide) --

How many people on the list are old enough to remember Bob Fosse? & how many among those answering yes are old enough to remember "Lenny?"  I attended a blue collar Catholic high school. I had terrible acne. & I was in to Lenny Bruce, not exactly the ticket to success in the repressive Orlando, Florida that I grew up in. I haven't seen the Dylan movie. I trust the comments here far more than I do the crits.

It's too bad Fosse isn't around to try his had at a Dylan docu/dram. Lenny was pretty Gddamn decent. I'll never forget Hoffman doing Bruce, intoning that great  "To is a preposition, come is a verb" line.

I saw *I'm Not There* last night and liked it very much. But then,
unlike Aldon, I've liked the other Todd Haines's films I've seen, the
early one on Karen Carpenter and, especially, *Far from Heaven* (his
tribute to Douglas Sirk).  His new film stuck me as one of the most
aesthetically and conceptually original films I've seen recently. It's
uneven, sure; but it's exploratory. I'd think of it in conjunction with
long-time favorites like *Pennies from Heaven*. The send-ups of the
Scorsese documentary were hysterical, bringing to mind The Mighty Wind.
And while Baez was great in the Scorsese film,  the (Julianne Moore)
caricature here was quite funny (and it reminded me of the National
Lampoon parody years back: "Pull the Trig-rows Neg-rows, we're with you
all the way/ Just across the Bay"). The Pat Garrett/Billy the Kid
segments were a bit lugubrious, though I like the Peckinpah film, so I
appreciated the gesture. The Allen Ginsberg avatar figure (in the
Felliniesque sequence) was interesting maybe most just because it was
*there* (and in that segment of the film the Dylan avatar figure was in
"being there" mode as well). And as Stephen Baraban notes the
(Bunuel-like) sequence before the Christ figure was more substantive.
Also, Haines does good by Charlotte Gainsbourg and Richie Havens. I
thought the most interesting Brechtian motif was the the preteen
African-American hobo/"Woody Guthrie" sequences (as played by Marcus
Carl Franklin).

As we were leaving the Lincoln Square theater #2, Ed Koch was standing
in an alcove, accompanying himself on the Jew's harp.

He was singing "Master of War."

In reply to Leonard:

  I couldn't fault anyone for making a politically-motivated critique of U.S.
  movies, but it does seem like there are better targets. Why pick on Haynes
  in particular (rather than, say, Tarantino, or Spielberg, or Mel Gibson, or
  Christopher Guest, or any other crap-vendor... though I could understand
  a "they're all the same insofar as they don't address the current crisis"
  stance).

  In a note on his film "Safe" (a brilliant and searing critique of SoCal class
  structure, sexism,  new age totalitarianism, medicine, and the conditions behind
  and around environmental illness), Haynes says:

  "I agree with Fassbinder who said, "revolution doesn't belong on the cinema screen, but outside, in the world". To provide an audience with a solution - to give them the revolution - is to deprive them of the necessity of creating their own. Viewers of film have extraordinary powers: they can make life out of reflections on the wall. Perhaps it's in the spaces we allow them to reflect themselves that films encourage these powers of transformation to continue - even after the movie is over."

  It's a point that could certainly be abused, but a pretty good one nonetheless.

  cheers,

  Andy

i show "Lenny" in classes relatively frequently; it's a mixed bag. it
candy-coats Lenny's message and personality and makes him out like a
love-and-peace messiah; he had sharp edges in real life. it's a real
tour de force of acting, though, that's for sure, both hoffman and
perrine. the film bears the marks of its era, though, in its obsession
with breasts.  it's well worth seeing, but again, i guess no
docu-bio-drama can be expected to be an unmediated access to its subject
(to point out the banally obvious).
so what do you-all think of Velvet Goldmine?
i haven't seen it yet myself.

The Kane`ohe Christmas parade was held today; it's a huge event here,
with thousands of participants, including
politicians, firemen, old people (the retirement home folks wore shirts
that read "Peace" and bore the word on their
float), hula halau (they had a peace sign on their float), church
groups, and of course the cops and the Marines.
My kids marched in the parade with their scout troops.

I put out five signs on the parade route last night, hoping that some of
them would survive, and they all did!  The theme
was Jesus (the pacific Jesus, not the warring one).

"Got health care?" still hangs in the middle of Kane`ohe from last
week's "got ?" series, as well.

The last five photos of album 3 show the signs in their state of nature;
there's a still-life beforehand from the workshop.

As ever, please feel free to pull signs, just don't attribute them to me
by name.

aloha, the Sidewalk Blogger.

I did like the Richie Havens sequence -- And I thought the whole idea of the
Woodie Guthrie segment was inspired -- A film based on the "lives of Bob Dylan"
including a segment in which a boy lives the lies Dylan told about his youth --
As I said, for a few minutes there I thought I was going to like the movie --

Interesting that you mention *Pennies from Heaven.* I started posting while pushing this film. It was a Steve Martin vs. Woody Allen Post. I'll take Martin in almost any venue,  although Allen has had a more distinguished film career. Shit,  Alllen ain't that great a comedian... & Martin is an excellent writer.

For all its experimentalism of form (it is definitely non-linear in its composition and in its use of 6 actors, and so forth, and other experiments with film stock and of course the inevitable post-modernist self-referentialism and homages to numerous other films, both Dylan and non-Dylan, particularly Godard and even Peckinpah or Altman) it's also deeply conservative in that it has many aspects of the typical "bio-pic".  Of course all this traditional/experimental and non-linear framework is entirely in keeping with a Dylan song which may finally be the point.  Cate Blanchett is good in her nailing the mid-sixties Dylan's mannerisms and so on, but her performance falls into the trap of many other performances that seek to become one with another well-known persona. In this movie, the young man who plays Dylan as a child I thought more interesting than Blanchett, as was Richard Gere in a truly mesmerizing sequence which brings to mind the aforementioned Peckingpah and
 Altman, but also Dylan's Basement Tapes, John Wesley Harding, the film and soundtrack Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid and also the Rolling Thunder Revue.  All in about 20 minutes of film.  Richard Gere's mostly silent performance (I believe he also narrates the film) is remarkable and the one truly good Dylan cover (of the Basement Tapes song "Goin' to Acapulco") performed by Jim James (in Rolling Thunder-style white face makeup) is the highlight moment of the film. [Andy - - - where is the church you refer to?  All I saw was a gazeebo).
  The Heath Ledger mid-seventies Dylan of Woodstock New Morning to Blood on the Tracks era is least successful, in my opinion.  Here's where the Godard comes in and here is also where the film becomes far too postmodernist, self-referential and flat.  Also the Christian Bale sections (as schlocky TV biography) was forced and could have been scrapped without affecting the film too much.
  But altogether I think it was a brave and appropriate style in which to tackle the immensity of Dylan.  Though I had hoped Scorsese's documentary would finally put to rest the Dylan as social commentator that burdens much of the Blanchett section to the detriment of understanding more about where the music came  . . . rather than from what it was running.
  And maybe someday Columbia will get around to releasing The Basement Tapes rather than yet another recycling of his alleged "greatest hits." All I can do is dream.

*"Through Western Eyes*

*I.*
...
It has often been said that the natives
will only teach foreigners a fake, degraded language,
a mock system of signs
parodying the real language.

It has also been said that the natives
don't know their own language,
and must mimic the phony languages of foreigners,
to make sense out of their lives.

=97 Linh Dinh, "Vocab Lab," *American Tatts*

*II.*

If one wants to grasp the underlying principle of 20th century Turkish
poetry in one stroke, it is that it brings animism into the middle of our
global universe. Everything in that poetry becomes relatively clear from
that perspective. Not only trees or animals, but in this poetry colors,
objects, things, natural processes are in dialogue with each other, weaving
their endless patterns. *Eda* is the structure of that pattern, the mesh of
linguistic and geographic coordinates which go to its creation. Not the
individual, but objects, colors, things are at the center of this endless
transformation, the ego attached to it only tangentially, a detail,
suffering and ecstatic. It is this peripheral relationship of consciousness
to wider natural forces =97 subjective and objective, visceral and abstract=
 =97
which gives Turkish poetry its stunning originality.

Small Press Traffic is thrilled to present:


Rodrigo Toscano & His Collapsible Poetics Theater

Friday, December 7, 2007
Timken Lecture Hall     7:30 p.m.
Refreshments will be served

Join us!
This is the final event of our Fall 2007 season and an event not to be missed!


Rodrigo Toscano is the author of To Leveling Swerve, Platform, The
Disparities, Partisans. His new book, Collapsible Poetics Theater,
which was a National Poetry Series 2007 selection, is due out in 2008.
Toscano's poetics plays, body movement poems, and polyvocalic pieces
have been performed at the Disney Redcat Theater in Los Angeles,
Ontological-Hysteric Poet's Theater Festival, Poet's Theater Jamboree
2007, and the Yockadot Poetics Theater Festival. Toscano is originally
from the Borderlands of California. He lives in Brooklyn, NY.

About the Collapsible Poetics Theater Toscano writes: "Poetics Theater
is a test of poetry. The Collapsible Poetics Theater is an all
volunteer effort, one that assembles itself within a given 24 hour
period of each performance. Each locale (with its resident poets,
experienced actors, experienced non-actors) brings an entirely new set
of possibilities. It is reminiscent of Commedia Dell'Arte in its
traveling, portable, rapid-set up qualities. To be sure, Poetics
Theater fits into the poetry scene as a baby does in itchy burlap; it
fits into the drama scene as does a little crown, little scepter,
little gown, all neatly stored in a metal suitcase (quite literally!).
The dings are just dings. The persistent question is: can the poem be
tested any further?"


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to
current SPT members and CCA faculty, staff, and students.
There's no better time to join SPT!
Check out:  http://www.sptraffic.org/html/supporters.htm

i've pasted this=C2=A0article from nytimes yesterday.=20
anyone have any ideas on this?
bobbi


For a company that ostensibly believes in the Internet=E2=80=99s liberating=20=
power, Yahoo has a gallingly backward understanding of the value of free exp=
ression.

The company helped Beijing=E2=80=99s state police uncover the Internet ident=
ities of two Chinese journalists, who were handed 10 years in prison for dis=
seminating pro-democracy writings. Testifying before Congress last year abou=
t one case, Yahoo=E2=80=99s legal counsel said the company was unaware of th=
e nature of the investigation. Did he miss the language about providing =E2=
=80=9Cstate secrets to foreign entities=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 a red flag for a=20=
political prosecution?=20

Last month, Yahoo settled a suit by the families of the jailed journalists b=
ut it did not admit doing wrong and is refusing to change its procedures to=20=
avoid becoming a stool pigeon for China=E2=80=99s police state again.

Yahoo=E2=80=99s collaboration is appalling, and Yahoo is not the only Americ=
an company helping the Chinese government repress its people. Microsoft shut=
 down a blogger at Beijing=E2=80=99s request. Google, Yahoo and Microsoft ce=
nsor searches in China. Cisco Systems provided hardware used by Beijing to c=
ensor and monitor the Internet.

These companies argue that it is better for the Chinese people to have a cen=
sored Internet than no Internet. They say that they must abide by the laws o=
f the countries they operate in. But the Chinese Constitution guarantees fre=
edom of speech, the press, association and assembly. Those guarantees may be=
 purely symbolic, but these companies =E2=80=94 which loudly protest Chinese=
 piracy of their intellectual property =E2=80=94 have not tried to resist. W=
hat they are resisting are efforts in Congress that could help them stand ag=
ainst repressive governments.

Last January, Representative Christopher Smith of New Jersey reintroduced th=
e Global Online Freedom Act in the House. It would fine American companies t=
hat hand over information about their customers to foreign governments that=20=
suppress online dissent. The bill would at least give American companies a s=
olid reason to decline requests for data, but the big Internet companies do=20=
not support it. That shows how much they care about the power of information=
 to liberate the world.

Feminism vs. Muslim Women?=20

I have often wondered why some of the most vocal critics of America=E2=80=
=99s involvement in Iraq are some of those who would have the most to loose=20=
under Sharia law. Where would the ACLU, Moveon.org, and assorted gay rights=20=
groups be if they were forced to live under Sharia Law. I don=E2=80=99t unde=
rstand why some of these groups don=E2=80=99t make a common cause with those=
 fighting for the same rights in Iraq and the Middle East.

=C2=A0

For example, under Muslim law, women have very few rights. While most citize=
ns in the Middle East have very little influence over their government, many=
 women are in even worse shape. How often have we seen articles in the news=20=
about honor killings? How many female genital mutilations are performed in t=
he Middle East without the consent of the girl being exposed to this barbari=
c practice? How many girls are sentenced to prison because they were raped?

=C2=A0

I recently read an article in the Weekly Standard from May of 2007 by Christ=
ina Hoff Sommers that ask some of these same questions. She asks why there a=
ren=E2=80=99t more demonstrations here in the United States to help women in=
 Muslim countries. Ms. Sommers points out, =E2=80=9C[d]uring the 1980=E2=80=
=99s, there were massive demonstrations on American campuses against racial=20=
apartheid in South Africa. There is no remotely comparable movement on today=
=E2=80=99s campuses against the gender apartheid prevalent in large parts of=
 the world.=E2=80=9D Ms. Sommers argues that while the, =E2=80=9C=E2=80=A6co=
ndition of Muslim women may be the most pressing women=E2=80=99s issue of ou=
r age...=E2=80=9D too many feminist groups today are focused on attacking th=
e United States and not on examining the condition of women outside of the U=
.S.

=C2=A0

I did a random sampling of feminist groups in the United States to see if Ms=
. Sommers was being fair in her characterization of these groups. Very few o=
f the websites I visited talked at all about women outside the United States=
. In a domestic violence study on the Center for the Advancement of Women, t=
he group mentions talking to what it considers a diverse group: non-minority=
, African-American, Asian, Latina, adult and teenage women. Since the study=20=
does bring up religion, I was surprised there was no mention of Muslim women=
.

=C2=A0

A more prominent group, The National Organization for Women (NOW), list as t=
heir top priorities: Abortion Rights / Reproductive Issues, Violence against=
 Women, Constitutional Equality, Promoting Diversity / Ending Racism, Lesbia=
n Rights, and Economic Justice. =E2=80=9CGlobal Feminism=E2=80=9D appears as=
 bullet point five under =E2=80=9COther Important Issues=E2=80=9D. You will=20=
be happy to know that at number four in this same category is =E2=80=9CFight=
ing the Right=E2=80=9D. Under =E2=80=9CGlobal Feminism=E2=80=9D the most rec=
ent article is dated October of 2006. I did a quick search on Google for=20=
=E2=80=9Chonor killings=E2=80=9D and found articles on CNN, The Christian Sc=
ience Monitor, and other sources much more recent than that.=20

=C2=A0

However, not being active in any of these organizations, maybe I was missing=
 something. Going back to the homepage for NOW, I looked to see what the mos=
t pressing issues facing today=E2=80=99s women are. The first article was=20=
=E2=80=9CBreaking News: Cleavage on Display=E2=80=9D. This insightful bit of=
 reporting was referring to Hilary Clinton=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cbrazen step=
=E2=80=9D to wear a low neckline. Here is the link to the story if you think=
 I am making this up. And this was the headline as of the writing of this ar=
ticle.=20

=C2=A0

There are feminist movements active in the Middle East. Occasionally America=
n feminist will try to help these movements only to be attacked by organizat=
ions such as NOW. In her article, Ms. Sommers points out that these movement=
s are gaining some momentum, and that they don=E2=80=99t like what they see=20=
in their American counterparts. A 1998 book quoted in the article said that=20=
some Iraqi women=E2=80=99s advocates don=E2=80=99t like what they see as try=
ing to divide men from women, and separating women from their family.=20

=C2=A0

In her article, Mrs. Sommers points out, =E2=80=9CA reviewer of Irshad Manji=
=E2=80=99s manifesto celebrating Islamic feminism aptly remarked, =E2=80=98T=
his could be Osama bin Laden=E2=80=99s worst nightmare.=E2=80=99 Ipso facto,=
 it should be our fondest dream.=E2=80=9D American Feminist should take a st=
ep back from the political parties and look at their own ideals. If women=
=E2=80=99s issues, and especially all women=E2=80=99s issues, are what their=
 organizations are about, how can they not support an effort to provide wome=
n in the Middle East with a stable democracy to live in? Are feminist in the=
se groups so against the Republican party and George Bush that they would wa=
nt the women of the Middle East to live in conditions they would never, ever=
, dream of here in the U.S.?

=C2=A0


To drive the point home, the cover of The Weekly Standard with Ms. Sommers a=
rticle shows three women who are coverd except for their face and their hand=
s. The center woman has some hair showing on the top of her head. The captio=
n for this cover is "Government agents in Tehran warn a woman about her clot=
hing and hair during a crackdown to enforce the regime's dress code, April 2=
2, 2007." Is this really the environment that NOW wants women living in?

aldon read the ny press review they tore it apart and for all the right
reasons  i liked it with all its flaws
but now at times the flaws overtake my positive judgement but that's a
very long discourse
and still glad the film was made

With what? Pitchforks? If NOW is so irrelevant, isn't the threat factor of

No, but that question is a stunning example of the straw-(hu)man fallacy.
In fact, I may show it to my freshman comp students as an example of what
not to do. Thanks! *waves cheerfully*

Have you spoken to any Iraqis about this? You probably should. Saddam was a
tyrant, no question: a friend of mine was shot by his troops while
demonstrating against his regime and had to get his family out of there. Yet
I know no Iraqis who support the US occupation. You have to remember that
the US invaded the most secular country in the Middle East. Islamism has
only been an issue since the US invasion.

Just as a note: I have been very careful about making generalisations about
Islam ever since, as a young and ignorantly well-meaning woman, I had my
head bitten off by a very feminist Islamic woman who told me in no uncertain
terms that Muslim women were by no means the downtrodden persecuted sex I
had assumed, and that traditional Muslim women had the right to divorce
their husbands and they kept their own property after marriage and took it
with them when they left. Honour killings and genital mutilations are not
Islamic, but very culturally specific (honour killings also happen in
Orthodox Christian Greece). Etc. Her best argument, frankly, was her own
self: she was an amazing, forthright woman (as are many Islamic women).
Islam is as various as Christianity and in many ways not so different: after
all, not so long ago in Christian societies, all property in a marriage was
owned by the husband. (When when my mother divorced my father, the bank
manager insisted on my father's signature when she wanted to buy some
property.Only she hit the roof and he stopped insisting. A few years
earlier, she would have had fewer rights than a Muslim woman: remember how
Anna Wickham was sent to an asylum by her husband because she insisted on
writing poetry).

The aggression of the west against the Arab world has sadly made it more
conservative, rather than less, and western feminists have to be careful
that, for all their well-meaning intentions, they don't compound what is a
complex situation. What I'm saying is, things are complex, and if you're
concerned about these things, perhaps it might be best to speak to Muslim
women and see what they have to say themselves.

All best

Alison

 the girl being exposed to this barbaric practice? How many girls are sente=

=0A=0AI did a random sampling of feminist groups in the United States to se=
e if Ms. Sommers was being fair in her characterization of these groups. Ve=
ry few of the websites I visited talked at all about women outside the Unit=
ed States. In a domestic violence study on the Center for the Advancement o=
f Women, the group mentions talking to what it considers a diverse group: n=
on-minority, African-American, Asian, Latina, adult and teenage women. Sinc=

 Muslim women.=0A=0A =0A=0AA more prominent group, The National Organizatio=

al Feminism=E2=80=9D appears as bullet point five under =E2=80=9COther Impo=

s same category is =E2=80=9CFighting the Right=E2=80=9D. Under =E2=80=9CGlo=
bal Feminism=E2=80=9D the most recent article is dated October of 2006. I d=
id a quick search on Google for =E2=80=9Chonor killings=E2=80=9D and found =
articles on CNN, The Christian Science Monitor, and other sources much more=
 recent than that. =0A=0A =0A=0AHowever, not being active in any of these o=
rganizations, maybe I was missing something. Going back to the homepage for=
 NOW, I looked to see what the most pressing issues facing today=E2=80=99s =
women are. The first article was =E2=80=9CBreaking News: Cleavage on Displa=
y=E2=80=9D. This insightful bit of reporting was referring to Hilary Clinto=
n=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cbrazen step=E2=80=9D to wear a low neckline. Here is t=
he link to the story if you think I am making this up. And this was the hea=
dline as of the writing of this article. =0A=0A =0A=0AThere are feminist mo=
vements active in the Middle East. Occasionally American feminist will try =
to help these movements only to be attacked by organizations such as NOW. I=
n her article, Ms. Sommers points out that these movements are gaining some=
 momentum, and that they don=E2=80=99t like what they see in their American=
 counterparts. A 1998 book quoted in the article said that some Iraqi women=
=E2=80=99s advocates don=E2=80=99t like what they see as trying to divide m=
en from women, and separating women from their family. =0A=0A =0A=0AIn her =
article, Mrs. Sommers points out, =E2=80=9CA reviewer of Irshad Manji=E2=80=

should be our fondest dream.=E2=80=9D American Feminist should take a step =
back from the political parties and look at their own ideals. If women=E2=
=80=99s issues, and especially all women=E2=80=99s issues, are what their o=
rganizations are about, how can they not support an effort to provide women=
 in the Middle East with a stable democracy to live in? Are feminist in the=

cover of The Weekly Standard with Ms. Sommers article shows three women who=
 are coverd except for their face and their hands. The center woman has som=
e hair showing on the top of her head. The caption for this cover is "Gover=
nment agents in Tehran warn a woman about her clothing and hair during a cr=

 the environment that NOW wants women living in?=0A=0A =0A=0A =0A=0A=0A=0A_=

I have often wondered why some of the most vocal critics of America's
involvement in Iraq are some of those who would have the most to loose under
Sharia law
<snip>

It might be worth your looking at the history of women's rights under
Saddam's Ba'athism. It wasn't what you seem to think it was. The
diversionary invasion of Iraq by the current US administration (arguably it
was illegal, certainly it was founded on untruths; so mere self interest
might not be the only criterion for objecting to it, even were your implicit
assumption anything like correct, which it is not) has set back women's
rights in Iraq by some decades. Unfortunately that may be almost the very
least of what it has done.

A very powerful article.
The parallels with movie and historical versions of the "How the
(American) West Was Won"--
are chilling, and too often overlooked.  The passage regarding the
mistreatment and poisoning of animals and people, but, beyond that,
even the land itself--
all too familiar from American history.
To destroy even the earth in order to posses it.
("We destroyed the village in order to liberate it," as was said in Vietnam.
  Was it now part of "God's Country"--or simply "Marlboro Country,"
with some smoldering butts among the "smoking ruins" and  carcasses in
the Agent Orange contaminated,  cancerous, dying landscape?)
William Carlos Williams wrote that "a poem is a machine made of words."
That poetry can also be an  "Intricate Machine" --
a question at the heart of words--
is it that language, like truth, is among the first victims of war?
Or--the other way round--that war is among the first "victims" as it
were of language?
The "belief in words" and "the power of language" as an "Intricate
Machine, "as generators of "Weapons of Mass Destruction":  the forged
"Italian Letter" and made-up "intelligence" of "Curveball," when cited
by Colin Powell, Bush and Blair as "hard evidence" in "major
addresses" to the Nation and United Nations-- paving the "Road to
Baghdad" and "the Roadmap to Peace."
When one considers such terms as "the material word" and "the
thingness of virtual digital language" in the military parlance of
"avant-garde" or "post avant"--
what exactly is meant by "material?"
For example: "material" in military terms--"materiel," equipments and
supplies for a mission, or, in commercial terms, the shipment of
hardware and supplies via transport.

"As usual, the only symptoms we had were in the language"--Pier Paulo Pasolini

The workshop below is being held on Saturday, December 8, 2pm London time
as part of _Intimacy: Across Visceral and Digital Performance_, at =
Goldsmith's College,
University of London. If you are interested in more information or in =
participating,
email Sandy Baldwin at charles.baldwin@mail.wvu.edu.

SECOND LIFE WORKSHOP: AVATAR PASTE AND CODE SOUP IN FIRST AND SECOND LIFE
Leaders: SANDY BALDWIN, West Virginia University & ALAN SONDHEIM

This workshop will take place in the virtual world Second Life, and
  will be conducted by Alan Sondheim and Sandy Baldwin, with participation
  by other artists and performers in Second Life.

Participants from the Intimacy conference will be supplied with
  location and others details within Second Life. The workshop emerges =
from
  Sondheim and Baldwin's ongoing exploration of analog and digital bodies,
  using a range of technologies to remap the solid and obdurate real of
  bodies into the dispersions and virtualities of the digital, and then =
back
  again into real physical spaces. The "avatar paste" of the title means
  at least three things.

Firstly, the pasting of viewpoints together, the suturing of the
  subject into the avatar. Secondly, paste as glue, as half-liquid and =
half
  solid, as a materiality of renewable and infinite pliability. This is =
the
  chora of the avatar, the body matrix that is less a framework than a
  smearing of paste. And thirdly, paste as pasty and dis/comfortable
  substance, paste as slimy and dripping. While this abjection is already
  implicit in paste as glue, the pastiness of paste involves the projection=

  and dreaming through of the avatar, the inhabitation of avatar bodies =
and
  the emptying of real bodies into the avatar.

"Avatar paste" comes out in avatar motions and behaviors. Firstly,
  these are formed by symbolic orders, presenting surfaces to read in =
terms
  of sexuality, power, emotion, and other projections. At the same time,
  the pasty avatar body tends towards collapse and abjection. Work on the
  avatar becomes a choreography of exposure and rupture, modeling and
  presenting inconceivable and untenable data, within which tensions and
  relationships are immediate and intimate. One might imagine, then, this
  inconceivable data as a form of organism itself: as part of a natural
  world or a world already given; out of this we might think through new
  ideas of landscape, wilderness, hard ecology, the earth itself.

The workshop will theorize and demonstrate these topics. The first part
  discusses theoretical frameworks.Alan Sondheim will discuss topics of
  dismemberment, telepresence, and abjection in relation to the motion
  and behavior of Second Life avatars. Sandy Baldwin will discuss the
  topography of limits in Second Life, both body limits and spatial =
limits, an
  connect this to issues of the hunt and animal display.

He will also discuss the dynamics of performance and audience in Second
  Life. The second part of the workshop will show off Sondheim and
  Baldwin's approach to re-mapping live bodies into Second Life performance=
s,
  including: video and other examples of motion capture and scanning;
  intermediate processing of files (e.g. editing .bvh data or working with
  Blender); and then the resulting works, including documents of Second
  Life performances and re-mappings back into "first life" spaces with
  dancers and other live performers. The final part of the workshop will
  include avatar performance by Sondheim, Baldwin, and other participants =
in
  Second Life.

kly closed the 23.5 percent gender wage gap by "making=0Aa few calls to the=

 was selected from a pool of roughly 150 million=0Acandidates, made elimina=

=0A=0A=0A=0A=0AMcGowan, however, said he didn't get into the business of wo=
men's rights for the praise.=0A=0A=0A"What these women were able to accompl=

"I just bring a certain=0Asomething to the table=97I'm not sure what=97that=

These kinds of discussions really get my blood boiling although the response by Alison is very good.  Thank you for that Alison.

  The writer of the first post is as conservative as is Christina Hoff Summers, who is well-known for attacking feminism for all kinds of things, including arguing that it is boys who are more at risk than girls.   If there is a voice of right wing "feminism" its Hoff Summers.   She tries to take down the icons of US feminism on a regular basis.

  Muslim women are as vast an assortment as are women in the industrialized western world.   A friend's daughter-in-law is Muslim and feminist and does not suffer any of the crimes against her that the poster mentions.  A coworker is Muslim, she's more self-assured than most of the western people I know.

  Why does the poster concern herself with female genital mutilation and not botox, breast enlargement, high heels, eating disorders and all the other ways western women self-mutilate?   Is it that FGM is forced?  Beauty stereotypes are forced, too.  Don't kid yourself.  Western women suffer just as many injustices as muslim women, they're just different kinds of injustices.  How many of us know someone who was raped or molested or someone who faced ridicule on the job or at home?  For goodness sake, even Hillary Clinton is regarded first as a bitch and not at all for her exemplary leadership.  She won 70% of the votes in her last senate run.  But all we read about is how much clevage she shows.  I'm not pro-Hillary, she's not Green enough for me, or progressive enough.

  Now, I'm not one to say that we should deal with our own issues first, and that we don't have any ground to stand on in regards to "correcting" other cultures, because, frankly, we are other cultures.  We are together, and any injustice to a woman is an injustice to each one of us, man or woman, muslim, christian, jew, agnostic, atheist, buddhist...

  Finally, here is a web site that has more on women's health:

It might be worth your looking at the history of women's rights under
Saddam's Ba'athism. It wasn't what you seem to think it was. The
diversionary invasion of Iraq by the current US administration (arguably it
was illegal, certainly it was founded on untruths; so mere self interest
might not be the only criterion for objecting to it, even were your implicit
assumption anything like correct, which it is not) has set back women's
rights in Iraq by some decades. Unfortunately that may be almost the very
least of what it has done.

The source for the article in question re feminism and Muslim Women" is:
politicalfriends.blogspot.com/2007/07/feminism-vs-muslim-women.html

the article is written by a (white) American male--

I don't check sources in order to embarrass anyone or seem to be
attacking them--to say they are "wrong" and i am "right"--

i do so simply because of the attention and care with writing  that,
if one claims to do so with the writing and reading of one's own works
and those of others--
this same needs to be brought, especially in times of war, threats of
war, invasions, occupations, torture, hate mongering--
i.e. in terms of everyday life as a reader existing in a world
barraged by text--everywhere--and the combinations of texts with
images, sounds, vehicles, screens--text messaging--instant
messengering--faxes--
this attention and cares needs to be given to all texts--as much as possible--

i realize that as the recent discussion of the superiority of poetry
over fiction evinced, the "willing suspension of disbelief" associated
with the "inferior" work of fiction--
is amazingly considered to be non-operative when persons, even poets,
read non-fiction prose--

which any good writer of prose, whether fiction or not, knows--

as well as do a great many of the world's disseminators of lies,
propaganda, censorships of omission and commission, deliberate mis-
and distranslations and the daily spew-stew of pure unadulterated
bullshit served up hot and steaming in the form of advertising--

I realize that the days of "the committed writer"--dim, jerky, far
away, a Franco-American persona, genre, novel/film/faits divers
collage, a  cross bred hybrid of  philosophy, action/activism, and B
movies, strange poetry and "existentialist" images filtered through
black and white Nouvelle Vague flicks in a Paris during the Algerian
War--

seem very much "out of date" for many --
yet that doesn't mean the end to the "committed reader" as well does it?--
who is perhaps the only form of "committed writer" left standing if
one is --paradoxically--"committed" to the doxa of Formalism--

at any rate, checking sources is vital, literally a matter of life and death--


(though seeing again recently Battle of Algiers with a packed house of
UW-M students--who recognized right away they are watching today's
footage from Iraq and Palestine as basically this  same film, with
only changes of location and media equipments and much more
devastating weaponry--and still  very much the issue of torture--and
the amount of energy and passion the film generated--the sudden
YES!--of recognition and connection--was very powerful to see and hear
and be in--)

Since i get a great deal of news from a variety of sources, this has
been a continaul reminder to check into the sources, before i get too
carried away by a nice juicy headline or what seems like a story that
is particulalry "appealing to me"--

Another example of this problem "arrived on my desk today" as the old
school comitted writer might write--
Today via Facebook also received a posting that had been being
forwarded by Leevi Letho, a chain letter to be forwarded far and wide,
called "Holocaust Ban in KY Schools"

this was followed by a note from a friend in which the falsity of this
article was revealed and included also another note in this regard
with a brief comment by Leevi:

Re the post I recently forwarded to your "FunWall", concerning
"Holocaust Ban in UK Schools", a friend of mine sends this link to a
corrective page:

http://www.hoax-slayer.com/uk-holocaust-removal.shtml

Forwarding from Leevi Lehto:

For another, more comprehensive report of the background, check:

http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/holocaust.asp

Well, while the first link seems to be wrong (and misguided) in
claiming that there's NO truth in the chain letter, this does not
change the fact that it's a hoax. I should have thought twice to NOT
forward it - the more so because I share the general concern expressed
in the letter. - Leevi

I wrote back the following reply, which I feel applies here also--

I don't think "hoax" is the right word to use when lies are
disseminated in order to manipulate and exacerbate hatred and war, the
threats of war.
One has to examine the sources from which a great many messages these
days originate, for very often they turn out to be suspect, in both
content and design, intent.
Just because one may support some part of a message does not justify
the use of smears, falsehoods and propaganda in the name of historical
truths.
The American Invasion of Iraq was justified by citing as "hard
evidence" "information" known to be forged ("the Italian Letter"'s
"sixteen words") and from an informant ("Curveball") who was known to
be deliberately lying.
Millions die because of such "hoaxes" which are known by the
perpetrators to be lies.
It's really i can't repeat it enough, important to doublecheck
sources, masked intentions, whether or not one agrees with some part
of the message.
-this is meant for Leevi as he mentioned the word "hoax--but
truly i feel very strongly one needs to check sources before sending
on things--so much "information" can turn out to be "disinformation"
and it is extremely dangerous--thoughout history disinformation has
been turned into propaganda and in turn into wars--)



re the "committed cinema" and "writer" and "reader"--
Andy Gricevich quoted Todd Haynes quoting Fassbinder (or was he,
really?--)--to the effect that the revolution does not belong on the
screen on the wall, but outside, in the streets.
     What no one is thinking about is that Revolution for the two film
makers historically meant very different things.  And that for Haynes
historically, as a lived experience shaping his thinking and work,  it
is the Reagan Revolution.   Haynes mystifyingly describes cinema not
as a projection of light and shadows on a wall, but as a "reflection".
Since he is "author" of his works--are we not watching then a film of
Mr Haynes himself up there as a "reflection" on the wall of the
screen?  Did you really think the film is "about" Bob Dylan? Or simply
the exhaustion and entropy of a culture  "reflected" by and as Mr
Haynes--with the creaking devices of many an old movie, play and
novel--including the one of actors of various sexes and ages playing a
celebrity/protagonist who is "really" "the author" "in search of
movie"- viewed as a series of retellings of the same old incidents,
the same old jokes, the same old "restagings" or "refound footage.
The film's title, "I'm Not There"--is very true for mr Dylan--because
it is Mr Haynes who is there.  You can find Bob Dylan down the street,
his road from the coffeehouses of Dinkytown having led to the
globalized coffeehouses of Starbucks, which is a distributor for not
only his new CDs and the special packages for the PBS Soundtrack, but
also--how darling!--bootlegs of his very early coffee houses
appearances.

I wrote a letter analyzing the quoted text of Mr Haynes'--but it was
perhaps fortunately lost by an accidental hitting of the wrong key--
i haven't had such a good laugh in the way of an example of
pretentious doublespeak in a couple of days--
if you read it carefully what he is saying is basically that--i
encourage you to think about my movie after it is over--
as the title of one of his films says, don't worry, this is a very "Safe" film--

many thanks to Andy for quoting this

Note--
this is the article which is the text of the forwards and comment by Leevi Lehto

It is a matter of history that when Supreme Commander of the Allied
Forces, General Dwight Eisenhower, found the victims of the death
camps, he ordered all possible photographs to be taken, and for the
German people from surrounding villages to be ushered through the
camps and even made to bury the dead.

He did this because he said in words to this effect: 'Get it all on
record now - get the films - get the witnesses - because somewhere
down the track of history some bastard will get up and say that this
never happened.'

In Memorial

This week, the UK removed The Holocaust from its school curriculum
because it 'offended' the Muslim population which claims it never
occurred.

This is a frightening portent of the fear that is gripping the world
and how easily each country is giving into it.

It is now more than 60 years after the Second World War in Europe ended.

This email is being sent as a memorial chain, in memory of the
6 million Jews,
20 million Russians,
10 million Christians
and 1,900 Catholic priests
who were murdered, massacred, raped, burned, starved and humiliated
while the German and Russia peoples looking the other way.

Now, more than ever, with Iran, among others, claiming the Holocaust
to be a `myth`, it is imperative to make sure the world NEVER forgets.

This email is intended to reach 40 million people worldwide.

Be a link in the memorial chain and help distribute this around the world.

Don't just delete this. It will take a minute to pass this along.

Yeah, that's a good old Iggy Pop song, for sure.  He definitely surpassed it
when he did this song with the Teddybears, last year or so?:

i agree that was a good article.

but anytime nyrb spills any ink about poetry, it's bound to be snororous.
the same issue you refer to, there's a big article on the poetry of edward
arlington robinson. and maybe some other snororific 2x4poborer. i guess
there's just nobody home with a clue about poetry at nyrb.

well, but the live performance aspect of the 1977 concert Passenger is
so compelling in his case. though it is nice to see someone aging with
panache now.

(apologies for the length)


(Sandy Baldwin, You; Alan Sondheim, Alan Dojoji)


[18:44]  You: My avatars! My little people! They run around everywhere,
underfoot. I will play a  song, a little aire, a jig or rondelay!
[18:45]  Alan Dojoji: There's nothing about us that isn't caressed by language,
that isn't languaging. There's nothing about us that isn't read or inscribed;
the real itself is an inscription, as far as we're concerned.
[18:45]  Alan Dojoji: You might consider tattoos for example, or any gesture
one might make...
[18:46]  sandy Taifun: sidecar
[18:46]  Sidecar Potluck: friends
[18:47]  Sidecar Potluck: nice boots
conscious and formal systems.
[18:49]  You: transformed new early version of the avatar 'outt' behavior
[18:49]  You: the avatar is blue in a  construct-space of outt-structure.
[18:49]  You: each  avatar-video or each avatar-performance is different in
content from each  other but not in degree.
[18:49]  You: sukara, dakshinanila, nandiskandhardhara, dhurya, prakata,
pritvardhana, aparajita, sarvasattva, govinda, adhrita
[18:51]  Alan Dojoji: lecture given by a worm...
[18:51]  You: All water is a kind of milk
[18:51]  Alan Dojoji: or some such, a section of tissue
[18:51]  Sidecar Potluck: i hope the worm is contagious, lecturer
[18:51]  Alan Dojoji: We're further driven by desires; even the development or
discovery of a formal system is dependent upon our wanting to develop or
discover such.
[18:54]  Alan Dojoji: For me the emphasis is mess - nothing is as clean as it
seems - we're coded in the virtual
[19:08]  Sidecar Potluck: sure. I'm enjoying the view
[19:13]  Alan Dojoji: The body is made to appear as if internal tissues are
unfolding between the legs -
[19:13]  Alan Dojoji: This is done by color saturation,
[19:13]  Alan Dojoji: One of the things I try to point out is that these
bodies, all of them,
[19:13]  Alan Dojoji: are composed of sheaves - sheave-bodies -
[19:13]  Alan Dojoji: In this sense they relate to tantra, mandalas, tankas,
images which are to be imagined
[19:13]  Alan Dojoji: internally
[19:14]  Alan Dojoji: and as such lead one to enlightenment -
[19:14]  Alan Dojoji: but the image itself - there's nothing 'beyond' it -
[19:14]  Alan Dojoji: It actually breaks with the ikonic/symbolic/indexical
symbolic categories of Peirce for example
[19:14]  Alan Dojoji: It creates a psychoanalytic semiotics which is
irreducible.
[19:21]  Alan Dojoji: Language, behavior, the 'primnordial,' etc,, are all
mixed in together
[19:21]  Alan Dojoji: as are the so-called virtual and the real...
[19:22]  Alan Dojoji: This debris also relates to other issues - geopolitical,
ecological ones -
[19:23]  Alan Dojoji: the human as a kind of aggressive gaping maw, absorbing
the world for whatever genetic reasons drive it
[19:23]  Alan Dojoji: - and with technology, drive it to annihilation, along
with everything around it.
[19:24]  You: Yes.
[19:24]  You: Hello and thank you for attending AVATAR PASTE AND CODE SOUP IN
FIRST AND SECOND LIFE. Sandy Baldwin, who is in Morgantown West Virginia, will
be speaking through me. The workshop will also be led by Alan Sondheim, who i n
is in Brooklyn, New York.
[19:32]  You: None of this is true, none of this as matter of true. He and I
never touch. Nothing happens here in and on a screen that plays out sprites and
their gestures.
[19:33]  You: Through this interdisciplinary mixing of tools and collaborators,
Alan radically imagined the uses of virtual technology at WVU. Of course,
there's a long tradition of creative misuse of technology.
[19:34]  You: The aesthetics of the glitch music, for example, explores the
misuse of the CD. There's an initial similarity in Alan's work here: working
against the seeming purpose of the tools, refusing the normative bodies mapped
into these virtual spaces, wild dancing and utterance in spaces where we are
supposed to be still and silent before the machine, an _ethical_ insisting on
the pressure and weight and yet ineluctable absence of the body in virtuality.
[19:34]  You: But it would not be wrong to insist that a distinction be made:
misuse or glitch is not the goal but means for consciousness and intention to
problematize their inhabitation of the technology. This is seance and tantra.
[19:34]  You: The results are inspiring, awesome. They are also utterly alien,
but alien in the sense of the alien that I am and that inhabits me and that is
there when I shed the skins of habit.
[19:34]  You: The results can be understood as works, works of art. They are
works, as well, of the real and the virtual, worked over virtualities, so that
the work of art is trembling with the work of the artist.
[19:35]  You: The results are endless and undetermined. They form in chains and
links from dancing bodies to clouds of code to avatars to writings and on and
on.
[19:36]  You: Alan, the floor is yours.
[19:37]  Alan Dojoji: I want to begin by typing and comment on tantra -
[19:37]  Alan Dojoji: This is Buddhist, not Hindu/Shivite tantra, which I have
little interest in
[19:37]  Alan Dojoji: But i'm interested in first of all notions of emptiness
[19:37]  Alan Dojoji: Which are unable to be defined and which constitute the
core of Mahayana philosophy
[19:38]  Alan Dojoji: And within this interest, there are what I could call
illuminations
[19:38]  Alan Dojoji: that is referencing deity which does not exist,
inhabiting, taking the deity upon oneself as non-existence
[19:38]  Alan Dojoji: until the deity canbe discarded
[19:38]  Alan Dojoji: There's an odd parallel in Second Life, since these
avatar figures are basically sheaves, prims
[19:38]  Alan Dojoji: When you get close, when you close in on your own avatar,
you see (physical)
[19:39]  Alan Dojoji: emptiness within,
[19:39]  Alan Dojoji: nothing but a collection of parts which relate to each
other, seem somehow joined, but really are just contingent
[19:39]  Alan Dojoji: So tantra relates to this and to the tremendous power of
projection possible in these spaces
[19:39]  Alan Dojoji: On the other hand the projections are safe, distanced,
cleansed, always pure, purified; there's no dirt in Second Life,
[19:40]  Alan Dojoji: perhaps noise of one sort or another, but no dirty -
hacking's not dirty for example, it rides and invades the same protocols we're
using, just in a (fundamentally) different way
[19:40]  Alan Dojoji: Ok, anway to continue -
[19:40]  Alan Dojoji: I'm interested in the relationship between conscious and
formal systems.
[19:41]  Alan Dojoji: Consciousnessness is outside formal systems; formal
systems are the protocols perhaps ridden by consciousness
[19:41]  Alan Dojoji: Our relationship to formal systems is related to how we
make sense of the world.
[19:41]  Alan Dojoji: By 'formal system' I don't mean axioms -
[19:41]  Alan Dojoji: just a coherent collection of 'vectors' repressenting
objects and transformations
[19:42]  Alan Dojoji: To make sense of the world we have to consider our
bodies, our selves. It's clear for example that a 'healthy body' sees the world
differently than a sick one.
[19:42]  Alan Dojoji: And that a depressed mind senses a different world than,
say, an optimist would.
[19:42]  Alan Dojoji: Not to mention an aroused mind, or a disgusted mind,
[19:42]  Alan Dojoji: We tend to assume a 'purity' of mind or rational-mind in
order to comprehend the world philosophically, but there's really no reason for
this
[19:43]  Alan Dojoji: In any case -
[19:43]  Alan Dojoji: We're further driven by desires; even the development or
discovery of a formal system is dependent upon our wanting to develop or
discover such.
[19:44]  Alan Dojoji: Now,
[19:44]  Alan Dojoji: Desires are like icebergs - their ostensible content
might be the peak above the sea, but beneath the surface lies darker matter,
abject matter.
[19:45]  Alan Dojoji: It's this matter that I'm interested in, the abject or
obscenity that makes us human, even beyond the guise or presentation of
language.
[19:45]  Alan Dojoji: Now obscenity is interesting
[19:45]  Alan Dojoji: I heard a lecture by Pinker on language and the 'stuff of
thought'
[19:45]  Alan Dojoji: and he talked about obscenity in relation to primitive
areas of the brain;
[19:45]  Alan Dojoji: obscenity isn't processed in the same way as other
languaging is
[19:46]  Alan Dojoji: In fact it elicits a reaction (mostly negative) that
bypasses consciousness
[19:46]  Alan Dojoji: So that you can tap into the abject, the emotional, the
dirty, etc., within the digital
[19:46]  Alan Dojoji: through sexuality, the obscene.
[19:47]  Alan Dojoji: Violence here is different - it's cartoon-like - but
sexuality is more directed
[19:47]  Alan Dojoji: Technically, representations of sexuality here are ikonic
in a sense; they act directly, whereas violence, I think, works through the
indexical -
[19:47]  Alan Dojoji: it 'points to obscenity' but not much more...
[19:47]  Alan Dojoji: Now to the virtual
[19:47]  Alan Dojoji: The virtual is everywhere, the virtual is symbolic,
inscription, an index of our relationship with the real. Our bodies are as
virtual as anything online; we're a mess of codes and protccols, languages,
drives, instincts, communications, cries and warnings.
[19:48]  Alan Dojoji: There's nothing about us that isn't caressed by language,
that isn't languaging. There's nothing about us that isn't read or inscribed;
the real itself is an inscription, as far as we're concerned.
[19:49]  Alan Dojoji: But this is a mess - what's language and what's not
language, what's pure body and what's not pure body, what's thinking and what's
not - it's all a mess
[19:49]  Alan Dojoji: outside of emptiness, which is another issue, or not an
issue at all
[19:50]  Alan Dojoji: So I'm trying to deal with this mess, with consciousness
beyond or beneath language, with obscenity, with the real,m the virtual,
working through models and other ways of exploration
[19:50]  Alan Dojoji: I model the ostensible carapace, the outer layers of the
human and human behavior, the layers in space, transforming through time,
morphing, dividing in both conceivable and inconceivable patterns.
[19:50]  Alan Dojoji: And though this modeling, I hope to better understand
what it means to BE human, particularly in relation to all of that debris
beneath the surface, our obscene nature itself.
[19:51]  Alan Dojoji: Why obscene? Because this nature is read, processed
differently than cool speech or conversation; this nature constructs readings
and writings, and for that matter communication beyond or preceding language
[19:53]  Alan Dojoji: The body appears as if its very tissues were come out of
the genital region,
[19:53]  Alan Dojoji: as if it were coming apart, opening
[19:53]  Alan Dojoji: But in reality - two things -
[19:54]  Alan Dojoji: First, the body is composedonly of prims, sheaves which
have no thickness (well, a pixel or so)
[19:54]  Alan Dojoji: And there's nothing behind these prims, just emptiness -
[19:54]  Alan Dojoji: And second, that the idea of tissues is rally suggested
[19:54]  Alan Dojoji: by oversaturating the color in the image, nothing more...
[19:54]  Alan Dojoji: Sandy, can you take over for a minute or two ?
[19:55]  You: Yes.
[19:55]  Alan Dojoji: I want people to look at the hhhhh files
[19:55]  Alan Dojoji: file
[19:55]  Alan Dojoji: perhaps you can describe it?
[19:55]  You: OK. Please look at hhhhh
[19:56]  Alan Dojoji: (Voice and music, Azure Carter, words mine)
[19:56]  Alan Dojoji: Avatars, Sandy and myself
[19:56]  You: The space is also here in odyssey - another part of Odyssey
[19:56]  Alan Dojoji: Space - I think this is Gaz's space 'above' the normal
space of Second Life
[19:56]  Alan Dojoji: It's actually outside the gamespace itself
[19:57]  You: The song is a kind of keening in relation to the real, and the
dance, the two of us, is about that limin of real and virtual
[19:58]  You: I see in the video: dance (choreography, both in Sandy Taifun's
somewhat distorted but still "masculine" coded body and dress),
[19:58]  You: but also a kind of mating dance, a back and forth of ritual
courtship
[19:59]  You: but also fighting, masculine egos at war
[19:59]  You: but all this is a matter of reading, of the spectator
[19:59]  Alan Dojoji: For me, this could be more successful on my end, we're
stll working on control
[19:59]  You: The texts are grabbed out of the vast internet text of Alan's
writing.
[20:00]  Sidecar Potluck: it's phenomenal
[20:00]  You: Alan, you mean you're looking at control, not hhh?
[20:00]  Alan Dojoji: In the sense of phenomena or the sense
[20:00]  Alan Dojoji: No I mean that I want to add some things from the text
[20:01]  Alan Dojoji: r the sense of terrific?
[20:01]  You: Oh, I see, yes, do add.
[20:01]  Sidecar Potluck: yes.
[20:01]  Sidecar Potluck: both.
[20:01]  Alan Dojoji: It's phenomenal in the way that phenomena are difficult
to describe or limit, border
[20:01]  Alan Dojoji: Anyway in relation to human nature, if such exists
[20:01]  Alan Dojoji: anyway this nature contructs, let's say, states of
affairs that, in terms of organism, might be considered PRIMORDIAL,
uncomfortable, construing presence itself, desire, an awakening in the world,
fear, dis/ease - anything before the world shuts down in relation to language,
to the processing of language.
[20:02]  Alan Dojoji: Again, it's complex:
[20:02]  Alan Dojoji: anyway this nature contructs, let's say, states of
affairs that, in terms of organism, might be considered PRIMORDIAL,
uncomfortable, construing presence itself, desire, an awakening in the world,
fear, dis/ease - anything before the world shuts down in relation to language,
to the processing of language.
[20:02]  Alan Dojoji: The world shuts down in relation to death; it also shuts
down in relation to obscenity, the abject
[20:03]  Alan Dojoji: By the world 'shutting down' I mean a kind of
turning-away, turning inward, interiority
[20:03]  Alan Dojoji: So:
[20:03]  Alan Dojoji: I began by thinking about the repertoire of human
physical behaviors, what the body can or cannot do; I used motion capture
equipment to record and modify the behaviors. The equipment installs behaviors
into files, much as labanotation filed away dance - it's a form of dance
notation - much as film records movement.
[20:04]  Alan Dojoji: These files are bvh files, of which more in a bit.
[20:04]  Alan Dojoji: Please go to, hmmm.... anitaberberr.mp4 - this is an old
piece
[20:05]  Alan Dojoji: In the center, Maud Liardon is dancing; on the left and
right are two avatars imitating (to an extent) what she's doing, but only to an
extent
[20:05]  Alan Dojoji: They're mirror images of each other,
[20:06]  Alan Dojoji: The movement was hand-crafted in relation to the video of
Maud and then superimposed
[20:06]  Alan Dojoji: You don't have to run the whole thing to get the idea
here
[20:07]  You: But what about when Foofwa enters?
[20:07]  Alan Dojoji: He's entering into the Maud-space, not the avatar space,
he moves in and out; the avatars keep dancing
[20:07]  You: ok
[20:07]  Alan Dojoji: You might think of him as a meta-diegesis - in other
words outside the narrative but nonetheless controlling it; it's his
choreography
[20:08]  Alan Dojoji: Please open jungamer.mp4
[20:08]  You: I'd wonder about the earlier terms "shutting down" and
interiority in relation to these examples?
[20:08]  Alan Dojoji: You might also want to come closer to my moving figure
here -
[20:08]  Alan Dojoji: I can't answer that at the moment?
[20:08]  You: ok
[20:09]  Alan Dojoji: I'm not sure where you mean; I'm running off thebasic
description I prepared but we can go back to this afterwards.
[20:09]  You: no, its fine - a question for later
[20:09]  Alan Dojoji: Now about the bvh files -
[20:09]  Alan Dojoji: So these files, which contained behaviors, were then used
to reconstruct such behaviors with mannequins, avatars, in two different kinds
of spaces -ones that were completely recorded, like film itself, and ones that
were live and in real time - so that a viewer might walk about an avatar
behaving in a particular way, in a particular live space.
[20:10]  Alan Dojoji: This is, of coursem the real time space.
[20:10]  Alan Dojoji: Now how was this done? Since I started with human beings
and encoded their behaviors, how were the behaviors made so violently
impossible?
[20:11]  Alan Dojoji: But more than that - the behaviors themselves were
INCONCEIVABLY CODED, that is, created in such a way as to presence an
impossible body - which then becomes a distorted body, a body transformed by
the pressue, for example, of war, of torture, of incandescent sexuality - an
impossible body -
[20:11]  Alan Dojoji: But a body that, being impossible, also represents our
desires in the world, desires which, if they could, would take apart a real
body, dissolve it in the throes of passion.
[20:12]  Alan Dojoji: In other words, the behaviors do 'violence' to the
virtual body
[20:12]  Alan Dojoji: The techniques are surgical, cutting and suturing -
separating and bringing together. The operations occur first in real life; when
a participant wears a motion capture harnass, a number of sensors are aligned
with her body parts - left leg sensor on the left leg, neck sensor on the neck,
and so forth.
[20:12]  Alan Dojoji: (again)
[20:12]  Alan Dojoji: We rearrange these sensors, splitting them among a number
of people, reorienting them; the body maps become distorted, impossible.
[20:13]  Alan Dojoji: We ask the participants to move. We record the impossible
movements of a single body.
[20:13]  Alan Dojoji: In other words, the sensors might be applied upside-down,
or split between two people, etc.
[20:13]  Alan Dojoji: Such distortions speak of desire and dismemberment,
torture and ecstasy
[20:14]  Alan Dojoji: The recording is in the form of a file which is fed into
one of three applications: a 3-D modeling application, where abstract forms are
mapped onto the recording, resulting in an 'abstract performance' or
'performer' - a mannequin modeling application, where human forms are mapped
onto the recording, resulting in considerable distortion -
distortion -
[20:14]  Alan Dojoji: And a 'live' virtual space, where the behavior recordings
are used in live avatar performance. I'll demonstrate these in turn. I'll also
demonstrate various ways and results of scanning the body itself.
[20:15]  sandy Taifun: that's beautiful
[20:15]  Alan Dojoji: In stripped, the file is fed intoa 3d modeling program,
Blender
[20:15]  Alan Dojoji: and objects are assigned to the sensor nodes -
[20:15]  Alan Dojoji: in other words, instead of, say, a neck on a neck,
[20:15]  Alan Dojoji: one of these shapes might be assigned to the neck, etc.
[20:16]  Alan Dojoji: So you get this abstract model of tensions and the
interiority of movement withoout the carapace of the body itself
[20:16]  Alan Dojoji: Sandy, how long have we gone here?
[20:17]  Alan Dojoji: Sandy, how long have we gone here?
[20:17]  You: alan: about 50 minutes
[20:18]  Alan Dojoji: so you'reseeing the joints from within, the nearest I've
gotten to organs here...
[20:18]  Alan Dojoji: Sandy, do you want to take over for a while? Shall we
quit for a bit?
[20:18]  Alan Dojoji: What does everyone else think of this - please give us
feedback
[20:18]  You: I think take a break. Perhaps get notes on the logistics from
others?
[20:19]  You: How did this work for y'all?
[20:19]  Sidecar Potluck: It's very good. And it works well.
[20:20]  Sidecar Potluck: A couple comments, if that's okay: one conceptual /
theoretical and one technical / performance
[20:20]  Alan Dojoji: Ok
[20:20]  You: Of course, this is just a part - oh yes, comments.
[20:20]  Sidecar Potluck: I really like that you're presenting a new (or at
least alternative) aesthetic of the abject
[20:21]  Sidecar Potluck: The performance of this works well as a marriage of

[20:22]  Alan Dojoji: Does it load quickly enough?
[20:22]  Sidecar Potluck: hhhhh is great
[20:22]  Sidecar Potluck: it loads quickly, but it's a bit tricky to find the
files to which you refer
[20:22]  snarkl Aeon: well . . . i'm not working from my laptop
[20:22]  You: Jeremy: do you see problems with the directions or the method
(going back and forth)
[20:22]  You: or nick, do you see problems?
[20:22]  snarkl Aeon: so it's quite fast on the clc computers
[20:23]  Sidecar Potluck: going back and forth wasn't terribly rough, and it
works well as is...
[20:26]  You: So, what would happen:
[20:26]  You: we would go on in a similar fashion.
[20:26]  You: I have more talk that I'm still preparing, about audience and
other things.
[20:26]  You: And then we dance.
[20:27]  You: remediations, mediations, projectivities, introjectivities,
phenomenologies, histories, and mechanics, of avatars

middle-eastern 'war'

[20:27]  Alan Dojoji: At the moment, I have to go - I'm teaching tomorrow and
have to prepare since I'm going up to Providence...
[20:27]  You: OK. Alan, do we need to talk on the phone? Or aim to do this
Weds?

the bell jar was so awful! i remember walking out; i went with Walter
Lew, who'd won free tickets in some local contest (send in your
poems...) the trailer beforehand was for Halloween, which was a good
foretaste.  wow. what a terrible movie. but i'm glad to have been
reminded of the moment; it's a vivid memory from my early 20s of
companionship in the Word, even if i spent most of the evening in the
lobby, waiting for walter to watch his fill.

Hello Everyone,

Our program has changed. We regret to report that Norma Cole cannot make it
to the reading on Wednesday. We are ecstatic to report that Macgregor Card
will read on Wednesday along with Simon Pettet!

The Poetry Project



Wednesday, December 5, 8 PM
Simon Pettet & Macgregor Card


Simon Pettet=B9s most-recently published book of poems is More Winnowed
Fragments (Talisman, 2006). His Selected Poems is also still in print and
available from the same publisher. He is the author of two classic
collaborations with photographer-filmmaker, Rudy Burckhardt, Conversations
About Everything and Talking Pictures, and he edited for Black Sparrow the
Art Writings of the poet, James Schuyler. "Like Beethoven's Bagatelles",
John Ashbery has written, "Simon Pettet's short poems have a great deal to
say, and their seeming modest dimensions help rather than hinder his saying
it". Macgregor Card is a poet living in Brooklyn. Work has appeared in
Puppyflowers, The Recluse, KGB Bar Lit, Columbia Journal, Best American
Poetry 2007, Lungful!, Aufgabe and elsewhere. He was recently buried alive
in Prospect Park with three other poets for Karl Krauss' "Earth on Stone on
Earth Is Naturally So." He sporadically edits The Germ (archive at
germspot.blogspot.com) and Firmilian: A Spasmodic Knowledge Base
(firmilian.blogspot.com). With Olivier Brossard he is editing an anthology

Alison--
I apologize that I did not preface that post/ sent too quickly...it was written on someone's
blog/ i did not even get name or byline--it was the idea of it--what i have been hearing from
2 sides--more like a question--I actually was trying to contact woman in Saudi Arabia
who sought my help earlier. She wrote me
back in Sept. that they were facing problems with internet/ msgs. not allowed through.
In my recent email to her I asked her to simply please send me instructions I might
forward to others if she still sought help via U.S. petitions etc./ to ask re: ways
she was seeking support with West in general (for she certainly was)(i am obviously
no authority--David Chirot knows this for sure)/ group of women in Saudi Arabia
in Sept. quite upset with fact they were taking away women's right to drive--she
was seeking U.S. support in
form of petitions (only that)so I wrote to her again since I have no way of knowing
what is really going on--I have waited 2 wks to hear from her (she usually answered
quite promptly)
--not hearing from her was alarming (maybe it shouldn't be).
If I do not answer posts it's due to fact I must take computer in. (in all honesty:
am taking it in today--it crashed almost 6 mos. ago)

Subject: Re: Feminism vs. Muslim Women?

Bobby

Have you spoken to any Iraqis about this? You probably should. Saddam was a
tyrant, no question: a friend of mine was shot by his troops while
demonstrating against his regime and had to get his family out of there. Yet
I know no Iraqis who support the US occupation. You have to remember that
the US invaded the most secular country in the Middle East. Islamism has
only been an issue since the US invasion.

Just as a note: I have been very careful about making generalisations about
Islam ever since, as a young and ignorantly well-meaning woman, I had my
head bitten off by a very feminist Islamic woman who told me in no uncertain
terms that Muslim women were by no means the downtrodden persecuted sex I
had assumed, and that traditional Muslim women had the right to divorce
their husbands and they kept their own property after marriage and took it
with them when they left. Honour killings and genital mutilations are not
Islamic, but very culturally specific (honour killings also happen in
Orthodox Christian Greece). Etc. Her best argument, frankly, was her own
self: she was an amazing, forthright woman (as are many Islamic women).
Islam is as various as Christianity and in many ways not so different: after
all, not so long ago in Christian societies, all property in a marriage was
owned by the husband. (When when my mother divorced my father, the bank
manager insisted on my father's signature when she wanted to buy some
property.Only she hit the roof and he stopped insisting. A few years
earlier, she would have had fewer rights than a Muslim woman: remember how
Anna Wickham was sent to an asylum by her husband because she insisted on
writing poetry).

The aggression of the west against the Arab world has sadly made it more
conservative, rather than less, and western feminists have to be careful
that, for all their well-meaning intentions, they don't compound what is a
complex situation. What I'm saying is, things are complex, and if you're
concerned about these things, perhaps it might be best to speak to Muslim
women and see what they have to say themselves.

All best

Alison

Subject:      new on rhubarb is susan
MIME-Version: 1.0

New this week on rhubarb is susan is a review of the December issue of
Poetry Magazine (now online!), with a focus on a fantastic translation of
the Italian poet Milo De Angelis. Find that here:

http://rhubarbissusan.blogspot.com/2007/12/milo-de-angelis-from-theme-of-farewell.html

Also, in "boy meets Hegel", along with the obvious, is a link to a brief
survey. I do encourage you to fill it out (literally under a minute of
your time), but since it's a survey of rhubarb, and not UB Poetics, please
only fill it out if you would consider yourself a "rhubarb reader." The
link for that is here:

http://rhubarbissusan.blogspot.com/2007/12/boy-meets-hegel.html

I'll publicize the results at the end of December.

Finally, there is the rhubarb-absent-Christmas-Hanukkah-Rohatsu-
Ramadan-Kwanzaa-Yule-Newtonmas so you can get paid list:

Subject:      "Louis Pasteur is born!" (Creeley on biopics)
In-Reply-To:  <1196712081l.946178l.0l@psu.edu>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I remember reading at least one interview with Robert
Creeley in which he pointedly mentioned seeing a movie
in which a doctor pronounces the words "Louis Pasteur
is born!"

I guess this was "The Story of Louis Pasteur" made in
1936? I didn't see any such film, but they must have
set up the situation by having the doctor ask the
parents if they have names prepared yet--and the
parents would have said something like "yes, Louis if
it's a boy, and Catherine if it's a girl".

Anyway, Creeley, at the same time as making a wider
philosophical point, had isolated the big problem with
biographical films--they have a hard time not sticking
the protaganist with a tedious fixed character, set
from the start.

Terrific directors have done poorly in their biopics.
I don't like Mike Leigh's film about Gilbert and
Sullivan creating "The Mikado" as much as the other
films of his I've seen. Roberto Rossellini, according
to notes provided at a Museum of Modern Art screening,
valued his biographical film about Italian
revolutionary Geribaldi, "Viva Italia!", above
anything else he ever did, but it's hard for me to
appreciate it all that much--it seemed like another
fairly pedestrian epic biography with a cast of
thousands, like "Ghandi" (though Rossellini found a
path to the creation of excellent didactic biographies
about people like Pascal and Louis XIV in his final
"educational film" period).

Francis Ford Coppola's movie about a maverick car
manufacturer, "Tucker: The Man and His Dream"--totally
held my interest--Coppola made it wonderfully
*festive*.

Is Spike Lee's Malcolm movie also one of the unusual
ones?--I can't offer an opinion, I've only seen
sections of it on TV.

Mostly I've experienced biopics as utilitarian
constructs from which I could extract a little
entertainment and some worthwhile information.  From
biopics I've learned some things about Ghandi, salsero
Hector Lavoe, & sex researcher Dr. Kinsey.

I'd like to see the flicks Aldon lists; I've missed
them.

Oh, and "Heart Like a Wheel", about drag racer Shirley
Muldowney, for me also transcended the usual deal--or
do I (a non driver) have some special thing for movies
about cars?

And there's Francois Girard's "32 Short Films About Glenn Gould",
which seems to come as close as anything to a story of us, which is
the authentic aim of a biopic, no?

in the running for worst bio pic of all time:

Che


Close runnerup:

Pinero  (though  this one has the advantage of a scene near the end with real
poets that you can slice away from the rest of the film and watch by itself)

I love Mike Leigh's "Topsy Turvy" about Gilbert and Sullivan, not because of
what it reveals about them; but because of the intimations of sickness,
sterility and disease which underlie the glitter of Victorian high life;
also because of the exquisite and witty performances of scenes from The
Mikado and other G. & S. plays. It is that contrast which is stunning and to
me very moving.

Another movie which had a last impact on me -though I don't know how good a
movie it is- is V. Minelli's Lust for Life. I never forget Van Gogh (Kirk
Douglas) spewing some nonsense about why Gauguin (Anthony Quinn) does not
apply more color to his paintings (Van Gogh's signature "feeling" color
palette) and Gauguin replying, "I like it flat." I love that response; a
whole aesthetic is buried in it.

An absolutely horrible bio picture (of an imaginary "great artist") is
Scorcese's contribution to a trilogy whose name escapes me. (The other two
were, one, an odd and very interesting Coppola contribution, a fairy tale
like episode with kids taking placein Manhattan, two, an equally awful
contribution by Woody Allen, I think, having to do with his mother. In
Scorcese's piece, with operatic, a la Scorcese brush strokes, the great
artist paints while giving his assistant female admirer a hard time, saying
art is all sweat and tears.

I think a very interesting movie about the processes of art (in this case,
painting) is La Petite Noisette (the long version). In that movie the
audience hears in real time (it's a very long movie) the scratches the
painter's specific ink-pen makes on the canvas. There is something violent,
predatory in the sounds.The movie shows how the painter c leans and changes
his pen, etc. One enters the creative process in terms of the passage of
time

Another wonderful movie is Kiss of the Spider Woman, John Hurt (a gay
prisoner, in jail for being gay) and Raoul Julia (a mach political prisoner)
are put in the same cell. Hurt tells his fantasies about a love affair
(which Julia is reluctant to hear) in terms of a Nazi soap opera (a partisan
woman falls in love with a blonde, nazi officer, who himself has his face
slightly painted). The kitchy style of these fantasy episodes are contrasted
with the realism of the jail cell. Gradually, Julia is drawn to Hurt's tale
and a love affair develops between the two. It is, to me, a struggle between
between the power of "reality" and the healing power of art.

TO BE CONTINUED

Ciao,

Murat

What sort of object is my mandala-image? Certainly not symbolic; while
elements represent, the mandala-image itself stands for nothing, neither
power nor deity, fecundity, rebirth, emptiness. Nothing stands for empti-
ness; nothing stands in for emptiness. And certainly not ikonic; nothing
is there but the image within an aegis or indifferently existing. Then
again, not indexical; let's say it's eaten, ingested, but there's no
pointer, anything like that. Let's say it's of the true world, the image
itself, and let's say it's the becoming of the subject, placed under
erasure by the subject, placed under erasure by nothing, then of the gone
world, then of nothing. Let's say there's neither mind nor emptiness,
uncertainly not inherently existing image. Let's say the image is of the
imaginary, that the true world is of the imaginary, but the imaginary has
no inherent existence. Let's say the true world is under erasure, that
whatever clings, clings to erasure. Let's leave it, but not leave it at
that.

there are many more knocking at the door trying to get in but these
the first ones that came to mind
if one included documentaries there'd be a great many many more here-
 bu this what comes up during a quick  break in the daily/nightly madness:

GREAT Biographical  FILMS

Paul Muni played Pasteur.
I don't know what Creeley was remembering but as I recollect the
movie begins in Pasteur's adulthood.  Josephine Hutchinson played the
typical quiet concerned wife pouring coffee, aging into  powdered
white hair.

David,

I like your emphasis on Bresson (what about Au Hazard Balthazar, life of a
donkey?). My poem, The Structure of Escape, is a retelling of Un Condamne a
Mort Est Echappe.

Bresson
withdrew words
into film diagrams
crossed by eyes
by windows by white
walls attract words
oh, cruel cruel
lover!

The Architect's Son (a son's exploration of the nature of his father, Louis
Kahn).

Now a faux-bio: The Girl With a Pearl Earring (would you like to see my
etchings?)

Ciao,

Murat

I received this poem from a young amateur poet who has never been published
anywhere and/or has never sent out any work. I liked the compostition a
great lot, especially coming from a never-published young poet - I thought
of sharing it with the group.

==================


Petersburg Diaries

i.	A queen once gifted built symphonies
to her lovers who tried to fill
her doorframes and died. Now, queen janes
buy a hip-flask-full of irony
under her baroque arch to give
to a recluse who secretly
composes anti-symphonies
to survive a city
plastic painting over its past.

ii.	Japanese tourists are like postcards
	roughly the same size and always
	meeting picturesque expectations.
	This one, assisted by another
poses prim in the clear light
of Catherine's window, and a flash
immortalises a floral print shoulder
flirting with a Picasso violin
framed in bronze.

iii.	A queen spent her grand passion and hung
bridges that opened to let tall ships
go by. Today, Catherine's children
in red leather jackets haunt the regal rails
and wait for whoever will pay
for the foxskin designer coat that will
look fetching to others only too willing
to pay for soft white flesh
with no strings, save a cocky purse.

iv.	He brings an orange flower with a long stalk
and halting English as atonement
for drunken attention, little knowing that
her obstinacy about walking out alone
must not be read as a sign of fidelity
to an absent man, but to a secret pact
with two men divided by generations, to live out
an idea called flanerie that so bewitched one,
the hashish-smoking Marxist, that he left
without unlocking the suitcase full of arcades
to stroll in.

v.	Peter the Great, the blonde guide said,
coerced his subjects to shave. If they
resisted, he politely invited
them over and took charge, ridding
them of offensive masculinity.
History and anecdote mesh to
turn great Peter barber immaculate,
snipping busily away to
springclean a bristly outpost into a
smooth, white colonnaded centre,
crisp stamp-marked authentic Europe.

vi.	A cathedral built like
the Parthenon is a souvenir of
a chequered history; grand czarist design,
monumental tribute to a vision
of splendour. Memories
of Stalin, however,
like sharp efficient snakes
Coil up and down the lavish stone
columns, flushing the incessant
rain of wealth down to a dusty
footsoldiered earth.

Ken Russell's movies were always memorable and lovably over the top. His Mahler and the piece he did on Elgar was great, especially for a person who lived in Malvern and walked the hills - and a Mahler fan too. I think that is wonderful from a cognitive point of view that one can watch or hear something, and then a flood of associations come flooding in - this is how I suppose short poetic forms operate, esp. those with Chinese characters that can evoke other associations on the calligraphic level. My mother always couldn't get past "I think I know who that is..wait a minute isn't it..no it might be.." Of course that is true also in poetry where one stops and wonders if the line was filched from X or Y. And Louis Pasteur - maybe Steve D. knows the Grand niece of Louis who in her 90's or so would go upstairs for one of George Whitman's infamous glasses of tea. She told me how her father (L.P's nephew) was in Australia once to look after Sarah Bernhardt's dogs...

By "etymological definition" an amateur poet loves what he or she is doing,
and this appears to be the case here. (Save me from what some call
professionals.)

I hope this poet keeps writing and decides to enter the stream of
publication &c. Seems very good for one who has not submitted before.

Amadeus once seemed like a wonderful film since, at the time of it's release and for some time thereafter it seemed wonderful as a good symbol of how artists tend to treat each other.  Nevertheless, the pure fact of the matter is that Salieri didn't murder Mozart.  There are at least one or two good NY Times articles in recent years by scholars disproving the old myth about Salieri, unfortunately promoted also by Pushkin and the composer Rimsky-Korsakov in a short opera.  Still, it's time to start maligning Salieri.  He wasn't as great a composer as Mozart ( who was?) but a lot of his music is pretty good and he deserves better than to be maligned with an infamous murder that never happened.  Mozart died of natural causes.  Regards, Tom Savage

I also liked Topsy Turvy because it presented a wealth of G&S material.  Also, someone on the list complained about Gandhi.  I thought that was a marvelous movie, too.  A lot of biopics are stupid but these seem to be two of the better ones.  Paul Muni was in one in the thirties about the Mexican revolution that was pretty good, if I remember.  Marlon Brando's one about Zapata from the fifties looks pretty sad now.  Even his makeup is bad.  Regards, Tom Savage

what it reveals about them; but because of the intimations of sickness,
sterility and disease which underlie the glitter of Victorian high life;
also because of the exquisite and witty performances of scenes from The
Mikado and other G. & S. plays. It is that contrast which is stunning and to
me very moving.

Another movie which had a last impact on me -though I don't know how good a
movie it is- is V. Minelli's Lust for Life. I never forget Van Gogh (Kirk
Douglas) spewing some nonsense about why Gauguin (Anthony Quinn) does not
apply more color to his paintings (Van Gogh's signature "feeling" color
palette) and Gauguin replying, "I like it flat." I love that response; a
whole aesthetic is buried in it.

An absolutely horrible bio picture (of an imaginary "great artist") is
Scorcese's contribution to a trilogy whose name escapes me. (The other two
were, one, an odd and very interesting Coppola contribution, a fairy tale
like episode with kids taking placein Manhattan, two, an equally awful
contribution by Woody Allen, I think, having to do with his mother. In
Scorcese's piece, with operatic, a la Scorcese brush strokes, the great
artist paints while giving his assistant female admirer a hard time, saying
art is all sweat and tears.

I think a very interesting movie about the processes of art (in this case,
painting) is La Petite Noisette (the long version). In that movie the
audience hears in real time (it's a very long movie) the scratches the
painter's specific ink-pen makes on the canvas. There is something violent,
predatory in the sounds.The movie shows how the painter c leans and changes
his pen, etc. One enters the creative process in terms of the passage of
time

Another wonderful movie is Kiss of the Spider Woman, John Hurt (a gay
prisoner, in jail for being gay) and Raoul Julia (a mach political prisoner)
are put in the same cell. Hurt tells his fantasies about a love affair
(which Julia is reluctant to hear) in terms of a Nazi soap opera (a partisan
woman falls in love with a blonde, nazi officer, who himself has his face
slightly painted). The kitchy style of these fantasy episodes are contrasted
with the realism of the jail cell. Gradually, Julia is drawn to Hurt's tale
and a love affair develops between the two. It is, to me, a struggle between
between the power of "reality" and the healing power of art.

Paul Muni played Pasteur, also Zola in The Life of Emile Zola (1937).
Biopics were all the rage back then. Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc
(1928), Griffith's Abraham Lincoln (1930), Disraeli (George Arliss in
the lead, 1929), Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln (1939) come to mind. Best
of the lot (with the Dreyer): Sternberg's The Scarlet Empress (1934,
Marlene Dietrich as Catherine the Great), an amazing film by any
standards, more seductive and a hell of a lot scarier than Bride of
Frankenstein. The set decoration acts as a kind of greek chorus. Really.

Also not to forget are Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the
Terrible I and II.

I just found a Wikipedia list at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biographical_films. It's
enormous. Calling some of the films biopics is questionable, but a
very useful list.

I don't know who's a pro-poet...an amateur poet for me is someone who rarely
publishes just writes for oneself and maybe a few friends. The poet's name
is Joy Mitra.

Speaking of bio pics --

Last reports, only a few months ago, had the Denzel Washington/Oprah Winfrey
Tolson Movie (THE GREAT DEBATERS) in preproduction, but this morning's NY TIMES
reports that the movie will open in theaters in just a few weeks!

The movie is about Tolson's work as debate coach and his amazing thirties era
team -- I suspect it will be a COACH movie and will have little to do with
poetry (though Washington will probably say poetic things and be shown
crumpling up pieces of paper) --

But here's the kicker -- the story also reports that Walmart will contribute
$100,000 to endow a Melvin B. Tolson scholarship fund.

here's the link to the story:

Dear Murat:

Many thanks for the poem

Yes, Au Hasard Balthazar can be considered very much a biography
because it is the story of a soul who finds Grace.

It is in many ways the last Bresson film in which one finds this
moment.  The film marks his shifting to color--the Jansenism of the
works in Black and White, interestingly, become more pessimistic and
bleak, without the moment of Grace, in the works of color.

In a  religious sense, this is very Jansenist--
in the Catholic tradition, color plays such a very great role and in
especially in terms of Illumination.

To communicate the withdrawal of Grace in color rather than in black
and white I find very interesting.  Color becomes the saturation of
the senses by the purely  physical of the Fallen World without Grace.

The opulence of color, after the monasticism and purifiying of the
characters in the black and white films, is treated as though it
introduces a new form of shock-encounter in the world Bresson
spirituality is grappling with.  And from which it doesn't seem, from
his works at least, he ever recovered.

I liked a lot his final film, The Devil Next Time--it has a kind of
strange "black humor" in the paradoxical "twist" at the end--with the
strange and I think very Pascalian treatment of the essay at suicide
which becomes entangled with murder.

One finds a knot--not a syllogism!

(My understanding of Jansenism, much as I try, and as much a I like
Pascal's writings, is still very limited.)

Paul Schrader, who wrote the screenplay for TAXI DRIVER and went on to
direct Cat People, Blue Collar, Mishimima, Hard Core and others--
was raised in a very strict fundamentalist family.  He never saw a
film before age 18.  Prior to  his film career really taking off off,
he published a very interesting book called TRANSCENDENTAL CINEMA:
Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer.

TAXI DRIVER is very much in the Puritan tradition of "regeneration
through violence" which runs through so much American culture,
especially in the Western, as in the great Eastwood directed Trilogy
of High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider, Unforgiven.

If you compare the uses of violence and the relation of violence to
language in Taxi Driver with Raging Bull, a very Catholic film, you
can see the what a great part Schrader played in creating the
character and "regeneration" of Travis Bickle, "God's Lonely Man."

(Taxi Driver  was loosely inspired by the Milwaukee-buried Diaries of
Arthur Bremer, the Milwaukeean who stalked Nixon and wound up shooting
George Wallace and has just been released from prison after
thirty-some years.
Interestingly, Milwaukee was the site of the attempted assassination
of Teddy Roosevelt when in 1912 he was running for president as the
Third Party Bull Moose candidate.  Only the thickness of his speech
stuffed inside his jacket over his heart prevented Teddy from going
down like a Bull Moose that day.
As he might say himself, that was one "Bully of a speech!" to stop a
closely fired bullet like that.)

Or the one on Ray Charles, a well done, but predictable Hollywood flic.

Notice how many biopics are about musicians. Nothing on Pound. Or the Beats. Or Berryman. Unlike Dylan, these are not household names. Everyone's heard of Dylan. But Pound?   Too damn bad. An Anne Sexton bio could examine the 50s & probably get a decent audience.

A bunch of films have been made about Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey. Of the two,  Fossey's life was the more haunting. She studied gorillas in Rwanda. Her life was adapted as the film "Gorillas in the Mist: The Story of Dian Fossey," starring Sigourney Weaver as Fossey. Fossey was found murdered in her cabin in '85, perhaps by poachers, or perhaps by those who saw her as an impediment to the exploitation of gorillas.

Well, this discussion is certainly less important than
Will Alexander's illness or the idiotic idea that the
U.S. interventions in the Middle East (which involve
habitual placings of pro-democratic Muslim feminists
on terrorist blacklists) do anything to help women
anywhere--but here goes, anyway.

I think Aldon's probably right in saying that the film
would be better if you didn't know Dylan was a real
person--or at least the reasons I think the film is
genuinely good have little to do with his existence
(though I admit that, as a fan, the Dylanisms are fun
for me).

At the very least, the question "what is/could/should
be the relation of art to politics" comes up over and
over in the film--a question I don't think films with
this kind of distribution tend to ask, and--in
fact--one which is even met with derisive dismissals
in the worlds of avant-garde poetry and music. Some
possible answers are offered, none settled upon. I see
Dylan's own dismissals of the issue in the mid-60's as
a strategic "leave me alone" gesture, and I kind of
think he's right (though a jerk... though at times a
very funny jerk): why should anyone demand answers
from a pop star?

In any case, the film doesn't take Dylan's answer as
its own; nor does it show it as one that benefited him
as an artist. After all, the chronologically latest
performance we see by one of the Dylans is the one of
Christian Bale singing the truly dreadful "Pressing
On" in that depressing Southern California born-again
church (Eric, that's the church I meant in an earlier
post). And near the end the "Arthur Rimbaud"
character, in his list of "principles for living in
hiding," advises the aspiring quietist to "never
create anything" (if you know about Rimbaud, you know
about his unsavory colonialist job after his
withdrawal from aesthetic and political engagement). I
don't think the film takes the stance of many critics,
who consider Dylan eternally brilliant (or am I just
"reading into it," as someone who thinks that "Modern
Times" is largely dull, sexist, formulaic, and
occasionally pretty good, but by no means a work of
"genius"?).

I think the film offers some possibilities for the
expansion of scale in art--how much of the world can
it include, and how? (Or, better--and differently--how
can one make the work open onto the world in new, more
generous ways, vulnerable to its answering back to the
work?)

Haynes sets up his multiple narratives so that they
suggest perspectives on each other. References to the
world "going on outside the film" are often small,
casual, dropped and left in scenes--or big and loud,
but in the background (the war on TV, with its
televised nature emphasized, or LBJ's face quoting
Dylan while the artist himself blathers belligerently
in the foreground). They don't get picked up
explicitly, but work as hints for the viewing of other
narratives, or other parts of the same narrative.

Haynes' study of semiotics is evident in the way the
categories of character and time relate to one
another. By the last third of the film, the various
"Dylans" have diverged from one another in character,
mode of presentation, and comparative distance from
the "real" biography to a great extent, seeming less
and less like portraits of the various "sides" of one
person, taking on an independence (the film is very
sneaky in the way it gradually becomes quite strange
and disorienting). Accompanying this increasing
divergence is an increasing frequency of "shared
memories" between the characters; in one of my
favorites, Gere's Billy the Kid (the farthest from a
possibly actual Dylan), gazing at the Missouri
mountains, has a flashback to the Vietnam war--but
it's the war on TV, as seen in the Heath Ledger (the
actor character whose career was founded on a
portrayal of the early '60s "Dylan") sections. When we
switch back to the hills, what was a gorgeous,
naturalistically filmed shot is now on video,
"infected" by the TV. This is, of course, a
psychological representation of the after-effects of
the memory on the present. But it's also a memory of a
past (the time of the marriage) into which the outside
(the war) was leaking constantly, even as the central
character tried to avoid acknowledging it--shown as
utterly tied up with neglect of the love affair and
friendship. And it's a leaking-in of the film
manipulations that characterize the Christian Bale and
Heath Ledger sequences (and the variation in technique
between all the stories) into the spectacular
naturalism of the Billy the Kid world (which was
untouched when it first appeared in the literal
kid-world of Marcus Carl Franklin's "Woody").

Narratively, this particular constellation of examples
sets up the incursion (leak) of the interstate system
into the town of Riddle, and Billy's decision to speak
up about it. As part of an accumulation of various
such moves, it has a more wide-ranging formal effect:
the stories become porous with regard to one another,
and that porosity eventually reaches a threshold after
which, for me at least, they open not only onto one
another, but onto the outsides of the film.

By the "Billy the Kid" section, I find myself unable
to view the movie without constant reference to social
and political contexts outside the film. The section
is set in an ambiguous time: lines from other scenes
contextualize it as the late 19th century (Billy in
hiding), or as any time between 1966 and the present
(Dylan in hiding). The scene itself looks like the Old
West, but the interstate highway system is being
constructed, and its planners show up in old cars that
were new in the 1970s. The anachronisms throw me
outside the narrative, where I'm prepared to go
already because of the porosity I just described. So,
when Billy is put in jail for speaking out (nervously,
as an "ordinary guy," not as the famous outlaw)
against the interstate plan that will destroy the
town, I can't help but think, "oh, criminalization of
speech, the possibility of arbitrary arrest in the
face of profit-driven enterprise in a time of war.
That sounds kind of familiar." That Billy is the least
identifiable as Dylan, both as a character and as
someone who sticks his neck out at risk of his life,
contributes to a close to the film that belies the
view of it as a tribute.

None of the individual techniques are new (diverging
narrative possibilities, contradictory
characterizations (though Haynes gets more from Genet
here than anyone else, which I appreciate), film
manipulations). So why do I care about the way they're
deployed as a whole?

As a poet, I've been trying to think of what can be
done to further open a work to as much of the world as
possible (specifically, for me, as regards political
content). I see a history of ways of answering this
question that includes Dante, the 19th century novel
(particularly Russian), Pound and Joyce as earlier
exemplars. If "taking it all in" and "opening up to
it" are alternatives, I'd put all these folks in the
former camp. For Pound, it's done by juxtaposition,
variation of materials and the variation of the rate
of that variation, the making of an unstable
archive--what I'll call the "hodgepodge." Joyce, at
least in "Ulysses," takes a "layering" approach
instead, where each event has strata of symbolic and
historical meaning underneath (poking through
sometimes), or floating above it. When we get to
writing like Ron Silliman's book-length poems,
there's, I'd argue, a more equal emphasis on "taking
in" and "opening out." The inclusion of as much as
possible by parataxis is performed via formal means
that, with extended immersion in the work, foreground
the reader's own process of making connections,
synthesizing disparate phenomena into daily,
more-or-less unified experience. The effect of reading
it (at least on me) is one of a residual dehabituating
of perception, letting a lot more in, noting a greater
variety of connections.

What all these works have in common is the fact that,
in them, the process of an increase in capacity
requires a "gesture of expansion," an explicit
widening of scope that has to last for as long as the
capacity remains that large. This gesture might be the
increasing number of sentences via the Fibonacci
sequence, or the intrusion of a language alien to a
main story, or a chapter in a novel that takes a
panoramic view of a society.

I think these are all marvelous, and have their limits
(in the novel, for instance, the "big picture" recedes
into the background once the narrative returns to the
story of the individualized characters; in Silliman,
the scale remains larger, but is still contained
within the limits of a linguistically modeled
"consciousness"). Put very formalistically, what "I'm
Not There" offers is a mode in which a tenuous whole
opens onto the world as an effect of the way the
individual, coherent continuities that make it up
change one another's scale of reference by making
gestures that are "gestures of expansion" not within
themselves, but when seen from the perspective of the
others. A small event in one continuity has an
"expanding" effect on another continuity.

I don't see the film as an end-point. I'd like to see
more explicitly political movies that extend these
possibilities. And I want to find a way of writing
political poetry that works with juxtaposition on the
micro-level while also employing larger blocks,
continuities whose own juxtaposition is fruitful due
to their "leaks." Haynes' movie (which in a lot of
other ways isn't as good as, say, "Safe") gives me a
lot to think about in this regard.

Sorry this was so long. I'll reply directly to David's
reply to me in another post.

Oh, and Steve--you're right, "one of the best films
I've ever seen" is a mouthful, from my big mouth. But
since you asked what my favorites are, and since lists

are fun to make, here are some off the top of my head:

Safe & Poison (Todd Haynes)
Medea, Salo, Teorema (Pasolini)
In A Year With 13 Moons, Effe Briest (Fassbinder)
Kristina Talking Pictures, Journeys From Berlin
(Yvonne Rainer)
Week-end, Forever Mozart, Numero Deux (Godard)
The Wife (Tom Noonan)
My Dinner With Andre, Vanya on 42nd St (Louis Malle)
Ginger and Fred (Fellini)
The Lady From Shanghai (Welles)
City Lights (Chaplin)
various films by Moshen Mahkmalbaf (sp)
recently, Paul Chan's "baghdad in no particular order"
The Muppet Movie
and, though they belong in an entirely different
category, Brakhage's "Cannot Exist," "Cannot Not
Exist," and the Dante films

cheers,

Andy

There's an album where Zappa makes fun of Dylan's harmonica playing, a cheap shot, but hilarious. Does anyone remember it? & speaking of Zappa, he'd make an excellent subject for a biopic.

The exposure once again of the American government and media screaming
for War with a country without WMD as so vehemently and viciously
claimed, is a very hopeful event in public language, among so many
other ways.

The use of actual sources based in fact to contradict the storms of
faked sources, lies, disinformation, distorted and manipulated
"beliefs" cited as "reasons" for fear, hatred and death is. if even
for one day,  one is tempted to say, a joy to behold.

Concerned with the life and death aspects of words, with writing and
reading as mobilizations----one takes hope, though without illusions


Yet even so:

"If the situation is so bright, then why does this bogus message,
which has been circulating in varied e-mail forms since April of this
year, refuse to die?

The problem with such whipped-up indignation is that the e-mail is
based on falsehood,"

as Esther Solomon writes in her excellent and much needed  article
"Break the Chain"  in todays online issue of Haaretz:

http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/929661.html ---

The article  concerns the forwarded chain letter "Holocaust Ban in UK
Schools", I wrote on Poetics of receiving two days ago, via Facebook,
from a friend who had received it from Leevi Lehto.

After the letter had been mass forwarded, someone pointed out its
known falsity.  My friend sent this information with a link

http://www.hoax-slayer.com/uk-holocaust-removal.shtml


 and included a letter from Leevi:


Forwarding from Leevi Lehto:

For another, more comprehensive report of the background, check:

http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/holocaust.asp

Well, while the first link seems to be wrong (and misguided) in
claiming that there's NO truth in the chain letter, this does not
change the fact that it's a hoax. I should have thought twice to NOT
forward it - the more so because I share the general concern expressed
in the letter. - Leevi

I wrote back the following reply, which I feel applies here also--

I don't think "hoax" is the right word to use when lies are
disseminated in order to manipulate and exacerbate hatred and war, the
threats of war.
One has to examine the sources from which a great many messages these
days originate, for very often they turn out to be suspect, in both
content and design, intent.
Just because one may support some part of a message does not justify
the use of smears, falsehoods and propaganda in the name of historical
truths.
The American Invasion of Iraq was justified by citing as "hard
evidence" "information" known to be forged ("the Italian Letter"'s
"sixteen words") and from an informant ("Curveball") who was known to
be deliberately lying.
Millions die because of such "hoaxes" which are known by the
perpetrators to be lies.
It's really i can't repeat it enough, important to doublecheck
sources, masked intentions, whether or not one agrees with some part
of the message.
-this is meant for Leevi----but
truly i feel very strongly one needs to check sources before sending
on things--so much "information" can turn out to be "disinformation"
and it is extremely dangerous--throughout history disinformation has
been turned into propaganda and in turn into wars--)

In the Haaretz article Esther Solomon writes:

No less interesting, though, is why chain e-mails like these garner
such traction, especially as the Internet facilitates such easy
confirmation - or repudiation - of all kinds of spurious "facts." The
answer lies in the role of the Web and of e-mail in particular in
popular culture.

In an era of lethargy and of disillusionment with conventional
politics, but also at a time in which the unknown individual can
magnify his voice virally many thousands of times through e-mail, the
idea of alternative activism at the touch of a button is clearly
appealing. For those with ideological agendas, e-mail is a perfect
weapon. It offers anonymity, speedy and effortless diffusion, the
difficulty of a wholesale refutation - rebuttals never enjoy the same
reach as the original allegation - and the networked power of
distribution (and complicit endorsement) through one's peers.

But before forwarding a chain e-mail, out of an indefinite sense of
righteous indignation, resist the herd instinct.

Consider whether you yourself really stand behind the facts and
sentiments expressed in it, or whether you are allowing yourself to be
cynically manipulated into feeling a fleeting sense of purpose and
participation that overrides your better judgment. As a talkback on
the HET Web site put it, "save the mobilization for real causes."

I'm thankful to Esther Solomon for these reminders to "save the
mobilization for real causes," a mobilization that exists in and by
the attention and care one brings to language itself.

Hi Steve,

You might be thinking of "Flakes" on Sheik Yerbouti (1979). Adrian Belew
does the Dylan voice. Thanks to Ben Watson's terrific Frank Zappa: The
Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play for jump-starting my memory.

Cheers,

I first ( at age 8) heard of Pound
from the Dylan tune. Went and looked
him up. Read all about him. Still do.
Once in a while I still listen to B.D.

Just in case my last announcement was unclear, offensive, or just plain
weird, I'm resending an invite to this reading TOMORROW (Thursday).

I'll be reading a new longish piece called "Harold and Sonia," based on the
life and writings of H.P. Lovecraft. which is better than it sounds, along
with some short poems. Eric is someone whose poetry I've enjoyed for some
time now -- a sort of Cornell-esque visionary in miniatures -- magical
realism that gets under your odor-eaters.

Despite a vow of not-weirdness (you can see the original invite here:
http://www.arras.net/fscIII/), you have to see this photograph of Eric Baus
rolling around in a bathtub of canned bake beans:

http://static.rateyourmusic.com/album_images/s4658.jpg

Eric and I have read together in the past and make a good sweet and sour
combo -- so you should come! If only to say hello! And there's food. And I
won't be reading in New York again for 27 YEARS (or until Bush is out of
office, is decomposing in the ground, is a forgotten nightmare on the winds
of fame and farts -- whichever comes first). Oh, and there's food.

book of interviews and criticism, Before Starting Over, was published by
Salt Book in 2006. He teaches new media studies at the Richard Stockton
College of New Jersey and lives in Philadelphia, PA.

There's so much cancerous, ugly info out there.
 Thanks for Esther Solomon's Haaretz article.

David Chirot <david.chirot@GMAIL.COM> wrote:   The exposure once again of the American government and media screaming
for War with a country without WMD as so vehemently and viciously
claimed, is a very hopeful event in public language, among so many
other ways.

The use of actual sources based in fact to contradict the storms of
faked sources, lies, disinformation, distorted and manipulated
"beliefs" cited as "reasons" for fear, hatred and death is. if even
for one day, one is tempted to say, a joy to behold.

Concerned with the life and death aspects of words, with writing and
reading as mobilizations----one takes hope, though without illusions


Yet even so:

"If the situation is so bright, then why does this bogus message,
which has been circulating in varied e-mail forms since April of this
year, refuse to die?

The problem with such whipped-up indignation is that the e-mail is
based on falsehood,"

as Esther Solomon writes in her excellent and much needed article
"Break the Chain" in todays online issue of Haaretz:

http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/929661.html ---

The article concerns the forwarded chain letter "Holocaust Ban in UK
Schools", I wrote on Poetics of receiving two days ago, via Facebook,
from a friend who had received it from Leevi Lehto.

After the letter had been mass forwarded, someone pointed out its
known falsity. My friend sent this information with a link

http://www.hoax-slayer.com/uk-holocaust-removal.shtml


and included a letter from Leevi:


Forwarding from Leevi Lehto:

For another, more comprehensive report of the background, check:

http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/holocaust.asp

Well, while the first link seems to be wrong (and misguided) in
claiming that there's NO truth in the chain letter, this does not
change the fact that it's a hoax. I should have thought twice to NOT
forward it - the more so because I share the general concern expressed
in the letter. - Leevi

I wrote back the following reply, which I feel applies here also--

I don't think "hoax" is the right word to use when lies are
disseminated in order to manipulate and exacerbate hatred and war, the
threats of war.
One has to examine the sources from which a great many messages these
days originate, for very often they turn out to be suspect, in both
content and design, intent.
Just because one may support some part of a message does not justify
the use of smears, falsehoods and propaganda in the name of historical
truths.
The American Invasion of Iraq was justified by citing as "hard
evidence" "information" known to be forged ("the Italian Letter"'s
"sixteen words") and from an informant ("Curveball") who was known to
be deliberately lying.
Millions die because of such "hoaxes" which are known by the
perpetrators to be lies.
It's really i can't repeat it enough, important to doublecheck
sources, masked intentions, whether or not one agrees with some part
of the message.
-this is meant for Leevi----but
truly i feel very strongly one needs to check sources before sending
on things--so much "information" can turn out to be "disinformation"
and it is extremely dangerous--throughout history disinformation has
been turned into propaganda and in turn into wars--)

In the Haaretz article
No less interesting, though, is why chain e-mails like these garner
such traction, especially as the Internet facilitates such easy
confirmation - or repudiation - of all kinds of spurious "facts." The
answer lies in the role of the Web and of e-mail in particular in
popular culture.

In an era of lethargy and of disillusionment with conventional
politics, but also at a time in which the unknown individual can
magnify his voice virally many thousands of times through e-mail, the
idea of alternative activism at the touch of a button is clearly
appealing. For those with ideological agendas, e-mail is a perfect
weapon. It offers anonymity, speedy and effortless diffusion, the
difficulty of a wholesale refutation - rebuttals never enjoy the same
reach as the original allegation - and the networked power of
distribution (and complicit endorsement) through one's peers.

But before forwarding a chain e-mail, out of an indefinite sense of
righteous indignation, resist the herd instinct.

Consider whether you yourself really stand behind the facts and
sentiments expressed in it, or whether you are allowing yourself to be
cynically manipulated into feeling a fleeting sense of purpose and
participation that overrides your better judgment. As a talkback on
the HET Web site put it, "save the mobilization for real causes."

I'm thankful to Esther Solomon for these reminders to "save the
mobilization for real causes," a mobilization that exists in and by
the attention and care one brings to language itself.

There should be biopic of Jimmy Carl Black!
I was surprised and pleased when he popped up on an album by the UK band
Ella Guru a couple of years ago.

I am contemplating using a print-on-demand service. To publish books and
sell them over the net.

I'm a newbie.

Of course one hears Lulu is widely used. Does this seem to be the best
option or are there better ones?

Any resources available to decide how to proceed on this? For instance,
forums on deciding which company to go with?

If you are involved yourself in print-on-demand, do you have advice on how
to proceed?

Thanks,

All,

  These are the first in what I hope to be a long series of digital poetry artist lectures.

  http://www.revver.com/account/show/heliopod/

  My hope is to ask courses/students/institutions to send me questions and I would
  answer them via our lovely blue screen video room. So if anyone is interested.

  cheers, Jason

I first heard of Edgard Varese by seeing him in an early PBS program about Marcel Duchamp.  The next day I met Edgard Varese and talked to him. (He lived around the corner from where I was growing up.)  I began listening to his music and then to the music of other contemporary composers which has remained my favorite music to this day.  Whenever I learn of a concert in NYC featuring Varese's music, I go.  It is always interesting and enjoyable to me, even though I know his music well.  Regards, Tom Savage

Lulu is okay if everything goes well but their tech support is worthless.
When I called to ask which default font they used to stamp the spines of
their hardcovers (no option to have a die made) they told me 'it's a normal
font.' 'A what?' 'You know, just a normal font.' Okay.

There were also some issues with the color correction for the dustjacket of
the same book and they told me the only way to get the color right was trial
and error at my expense, in other words, keep ordering copies of your book
and randomly adjust the color until it looks right. No proofs available.

Like Jim, I would be interested in hearing some testimony from other
publishers or reading some Consumer Reportish articles about POD. I like the
idea, but haven't seen quality that competes with traditional printers and
binders.

Cheers,

There was recently a movie about Sylvia Plath.  As I remember Gwyneth Paltrow was in it and her acting was pretty good.  Still, as I prefer Ted Hughes' poetry to Plath's, I wasn't won over to Plath's supposed greatness as a poet by this movie or, of course, by her poetry. Hughes' poetry is as good as that written by anyone contemporary to him.  If you don't believe it, check out a selected poems of his.  Regards, Tom Savage

Working with bookmobile.com via Nicole Baxter has been an absolute
pleasure.  They also have a wider choice of papers, cover stock &
finish etc.  The finished books are a much higher quality product
than lulu.  For runs over 50 copies they will also be much cheaper
than lulu.  bookmobile.com however doesn't have the online marketing
aspect that places like booksurge, lulu & cafepress...  & ditto what
Kyle says about lulu's tech support.

Hughes always impressed me. I have his collected poems. From there, I kept reading.  I wasn't so impressed by "Birthday Letters," his collection of poems addressed to Plath. Many of the poems are touching, but too private for my taste.

I think a damn good movie could be made about Berryman. His drinking bouts, time in rehab, are legendary. He was pals with Saul Bellow. He's my favorite  confessional poet. His poetry kept evolving.

Still, as I prefer Ted Hughes' poetry to Plath's, I wasn't won over to Plath's supposed greatness as a poet by this movie or, of course, by her poetry. Hughes' poetry is as good as that written by anyone contemporary to him.  If you don't believe it, check out a selected poems of his.  Regards, Tom Savage

For perfect-bound trade paperbacks the quality can be competitive
with offset, though most digital houses offer more limited choices. A
51/2 x 81/2 is printed two-up, larger sizes means a lot of wasted
paper, and above 6x10 isn't really feasible. Usually there are only a
few paper choices. As to fonts, if you can make the file they can
print it. For color, as with any other printing get a proof and they
can adjust if need be. Usually part of the setup cost.

I don't do casebound books, but I know a lot of folks who do. I've
never heard of limits on fonts for spines. But most digital houses
are happy to farm out cover production to offfset houses if one wishes.

There's a real advantage to working locally. I use Sterling-Pierce in
East Rockaway, just outside NYC. For the first couple of books I
watched the covers come out of the printer, which was reassuring.
Also delivery is very fast, and I can pick up the books myself if I
want to. They deliver daily to much of Manhattan. And when they've
made mistakes (every printer I've worked with makes mistakes, and
I've worked with most of the short-run offset houses) they cheerfully
reprint at their cost and in a very timely fashion.

I usually print in increments of 2-300. From their receipt of the
files to finished project is never more than two weeks, often less
than a week, and reorders are never longer than a week.

If you need more choices, the bigger offset houses, like Friessens,
are now doing digital as well, and they have a lot of papers to
choose from in stock.

Bottom line, unless you either like storing a lot of books or you
know you're going to sell a thousand or more very quickly, it's a
no-brainer. In my case, not having to invest so much upfront for each
book frees me to publish more titles. And nobody looks at Junction
Press's books and wonders how they're printed.

There have been a great many movies made "about" writers and their
bios, myths, personae, just not very many good ones.

(this is excluding for the moment documentaries of which there are
many very good ones.)

A good film was made of Stevie Smith's life, part of it--with Glenda
Jackson giving an excellent performance.  The film of Tom and Viv-- Mr
T S  Eliot and his first wife--i thought fairly good.

Reds for example--Warren Beatty's  intended "sweeping" epic life of
John Reed  (Ten Days that Shook the World, he also wrote poetry) had
also Jack Nicholson playing Eugene O'Neil
.
  Then there are the Hemingway semi-bios like Islands in the Stream
with as i recall George C Scott.  Biopics like Last Time I Saw Paris
based on Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald,  a bad old swashbuckler one on
life of Villon, the Rimbaud-Verlaine one with Leo di Caprio, Barfly
based on Bukowski, Capote which won lot of awards for performance, a
couple bad ones i have seen on the life/lives of the Brontes, others
from the  blurred pop culture images of the writings and life of Edgar
Poe, basically the ghostly after effects of Classics comics versions
of him, entertaining in a luridly filmed way,.
I remember dimly an old french film on the life of Jules Verne that was fun.

Ring Lardner, in Eight Men Out, played by John Sayles, the film's
director, and very well, as an amazingly resemblance

The really good films about writers tend to be of mythical or dream
poets like Cocteau's ORPHEE which had such a huge influence on Jack
Spicer, as well as Cocteau's much earlier classic, le Sang d'un poete.
 (Blood of a Poet)


And let's not forget a great film (screenplay differing bit from the
book, both by Graham Greene)--THE THIRD MAN--a great film featuring a
writer of Westerns (Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins) in search of an
old friend--(Orson Welles--also sought after via Cotten in Citizen
Kane)--

In Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven--a main character is a writer of the
trashy tales of "legendary" outlaws and gunslingers, whom the brutal
Gene Hackman takes under his wing --to chronicle a "real life"
gunslinger at work--

In Kurosawa's great IKIRU (To Live) there is the --again--writer of
pulp fiction, a  kindhearted gaunt poete maudit type, who becomes the
friend of the dying protagonist.

In Godard's Pierrot le fou, Belmondo wants to be a writer, and starts writing--

there are a great many versions made in several languages of Knut
Hamsun's great autobiographical HUNGER--literally about a "starving
writer"--

An interesting aspect of (real and fictional) writers in film is that
they are included in the action and developments of characters--as a
device, a commentator, an investigator, an instigator, a prompter,  a
spy--the writer becomes a link between the audience and the action on
screen--provided extra details, connections between characters and
sub-plots--
riffing of the scenes with their own personal imaginings and speculations--

The writer is perceived so to speak by/within many films as an
observer within the observing and observed field of visions of
characters and audiences both.  The writer is the "private eye"
exploring for those "inquiring minds who want to know"--in many cases
hired by someone in the film--and in a sense, by the audience also,
which has paid for admission and now demands a good return on the
investment.

The greatest example of a writer as many of these aspects in film may
be thought of as Shakespeare's RICHARD THE THIRD--since Richard
basically speaks his "writing" of the action --ahead of time--to the
audience--and then proceeds to act out the scenes--the writer becoming
an actor who is simultaneously directing the scene unknown to the
other characters who now make their entrances according to his script,
right on cue, and "follow his direction to the letter" in the most
literal ways.  All of which Richard can afterwards share as a good
laugh with his reader/audience

Since a lot of American writers had been involved with journalism, and
had done from time to time pulp writing also--it was an easy move when
many of these multi-genred, multi-professional writers worked in
Hollywood to insert the character of a writer
In many films noir, one finds a character, either a newspaper
reporter, a writer-wanna-be or a screen play writer--often as the
person who plays the part of the narrator, or a commentator on the
action--

Or the writer--because a professional practitioner of fictions,
lies--may be the "suspect" as in the Humphrey Bogart film in which he
plays a violence-prone screen writer.

For example, In Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, the Bill Holden
character is a screenplay writer--

In the 1948 version of Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men with
Broderick Crawford, a reporter turned speech writer and PR man is one
of the main characters--hauled along to be the observer--

Newspaper reporters were featured in many screwball comedies--two
versions each of My Girl Friday and Ball of Fire for example--
All the Presidents Men--investigative reporting--

Naked Lunch features its author Bill Burroughs as his own
character-(an actor playing Bill "playing"
fictionally/autobiographically himself--)-within both his writings
being made--and within the film being made of his writings--

One could go on and on and on-getting lost---into the labyrinths of
Borgesian libraries of decaying films in cannisters containing the
"lives of writers," "the days and nights of the poets," the tragic and
comic melodramas of authors real and imaginary, famous and forgotten .

I agree with mIEKAL about bookmobile.com and Nicole Baxter.
bookmobile.com DOES have an agreement with a book fulfillment
service, too, if you're short on time to handle sales/distribution
yourself. I haven't tried that but have been thinking about it,
particularly as our new studio has precious little space even for a
few more boxes of inventory. And even with print-on-demand, I like to
have a couple of hundred or more books on hand whenever possible. I
have to say that sometimes the binding used at bookmobile.com makes
the book look a little wobbly near the spine, although generally this
flattens/settles with time, and seems to be less true with books of
more than 150 pages or so. Also, one disappointment I've had (and
because of it, I haven't tried it in a couple of years) is with the
matte finish books at bookmobile.com. That said, I still think
they're the best of the print-on-demand manufacturers of which I
know. But I certainly haven't tried all that many companies. I do
agree with Kyle that their quality is not as impressive as books from
good traditional offset printer/binders. Our last book was printed by
Thomson-Shore, and one of our next books is being printed there as
well, and the difference is definitely worth talking about. But
bookmobile.com is certainly good enough that we will consider them
for just about all of our projects, particularly anything in a print
run of 500 or fewer.

Anyone know or know how to find out the first publication dates of
two books?



"Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, pataphysician," Alfred Jarry.

"Age of Huts," Vassily Kamensky.  (I believe this one is referenced
in one of Janacek's books but I can't seem to find it.)



thanks!

Oops, makes it harder when I munge the title.  (Apologies to Ron S).

Should have read

The Mud Hut (Zemlyanka)

which it turns out was first published in 1910.

Dear All

New Zealand has chosen Michele Leggott as the country's first Poet Laureate,
happy news not only for her word-caressing poetry but also for
the attention to the NZEPC, the New Zealand Electronic Poetry Centre
that Michele established on the model of the EPC.

For 2008-2009, Michele will officially foster New Zealand poetries digital
and otherwise:
more poetically charged-up life here at The University of Auckland!

Warmly thithers,
Lisa Samuels

The Theatre of a Two-Headed Calf! A New Performance by Lucy Alibar! QURASH
CO-LAB! Erin Markey!


Dyke Squad (a branch of The Theatre of a Two-headed Calf) is a queer
collaborative writing and performing team made up of Jess Barbagallo,
Laryssa Husiak, Brooke O'Harra and Laura Stinger, directed by Brooke O'Harr=
a
(with many amazing guest performers). Dyke Squad is pleased to present Room
for Cream, a live lesbian soap opera series which will run at La Mama, ever=
y
Sat. at 5:30pm beginning Jan 08. Dyke Squad came together in order to write
and perform queer theater and provide a solid venue to involve and engage
queer women in the community. . . . or perhaps to have some not-so-clean
dyke fun. The Theatre of a Two-Headed Calf, founded by Brooke O=B9Harra
(director) and Brendan Connelly (composer), is a collective of artists and
designers who are working in concert to explore new and often impossible
means of opening up and presenting dramatic texts. Their new production,
Drums of the Waves of Horikawa is at HERE Arts Center from October 24 -
November 17. Lucy Alibar's works include Juicy and Delicious, a bluegrass
musical about sex and Southern food (The Tank, Collective Unconscious); A
Friend of Dorothy, about Judy Garland (Best of Montreal Fringe nomination,
Avignon, Bath, and Edinburgh Festivals); Gorgeous Raptors, about girls who
transform into dinosaurs (Young Playwrights Festival, Cherry Lane Theatre).
This summer, Mommy Says I=B9m Pretty on the Insides and Home Baking Made Easy
(with Zoe Aja Moore) were performed at Williamstown Theatre Festival. Lucy
is an Affiliated Artist of New Georges, and a member of EST=B9s Youngblood.
QURASH CO-LAB (Queers United Resisting Assimilation into Societal
Heteronormativity) presents... T-Phag ProDuct #2 Chase My Hole, an 8 minute
collaborative 'ilm (like 'zine) that originated to give voice to working
class queer artists. The film itself is a double projection combining 16mm
and 8 mm film as well as a live musical score. In attendance will be John
Parker, a conceptual artist who created QURASH to build global-community
amongst queer artists. Parker also specializes in oil painting, woodcut
printmaking,and drawing. His work queers elements of concept, sound, form,
line, color and texture. He completed an BFA in Art at the University of
Texas. Parker also works in Super 8 film. Erin Markey is a performing artis=
t
and writer who creates original music and knows her way around a brass pole=
.
Her newest production, Puppy Love: A Stripper's Tail, is playing at NYC's
The Green Room through December 18, and will be a part of the nation-wide
2008 Sex Worker's Art Show Tour starting January 17th. Her blues opera,
Looking for Limbo, co-written with Joseph Keckler, was recently included in
the 2007 Lincoln Center Director's Lab. Her work has appeared at the Solomo=
n
R. Guggenheim Museum, Joe's Pub, Here Arts Center, and frequently at Dixon
Place, among other venues. Puppy Love, created and performed by Erin Markey=
,
music by Rich Campbell & Erin Markey, directed by Nathan Lemoine will be
available as an audiobook in January 2008.

I am using Lulu to start a press to publish plays with no capital
whatsoever, and I think it works really well. There are some good
supplementary (off-lulu) tip sites accessible via lulu's FAQ sections.
It is trial and error to get it right, but it's not so terrible. As for
fonts and color correction, I would be happy to share what I've learned
through trial and error with anyone that wanted to contact me off this
list kk@fancystitchmachine.org. I do it entirely with my own pdfs (on
quark express) and don't mess with their wizards. Their tech staff is
decent for the mechanics of the site- if uploads go wrong. I haven't
tried other POD's- this was recommended to me by an artist friend who
has several friends that use it. I'm on my third book and finally
getting the hang of what looks right coming out of their printers, and
quite happy with it. It's not as gorgeous as a good offset printer wd
be, but considering that you don't have to worry at all about putting
out money, it's great-- that offsets the cost of having to order and pay
for a book as a way to get proofs, which costs abt 15 bucks each time
you do it, depending on page count and color/bw.
Cheers
Karinne

Lulu is okay if everything goes well but their tech support is
worthless.
When I called to ask which default font they used to stamp the spines of
their hardcovers (no option to have a die made) they told me 'it's a
normal
font.' 'A what?' 'You know, just a normal font.' Okay.

There were also some issues with the color correction for the dustjacket
of
the same book and they told me the only way to get the color right was
trial
and error at my expense, in other words, keep ordering copies of your
book
and randomly adjust the color until it looks right. No proofs available.

Like Jim, I would be interested in hearing some testimony from other
publishers or reading some Consumer Reportish articles about POD. I like
the
idea, but haven't seen quality that competes with traditional printers
and
binders.

Cheers,

Working with bookmobile.com via Nicole Baxter has been an absolute =20

than lulu.  For runs over 50 copies they will also be much cheaper =20

I agree with Charles and mIEKAL,
mIEKAL recommended Bookmobile to me some time ago and I have used them
several times since. They printed my recent release
UNCOMMON VISION <http://uncommon-vision.blogspot.com/>and I was very pleased

mIEKAL,
Faustroll was 1911, but fragments had appeared in 1895 in Mercure de France.
Simon Watson Taylor's English translation came out in 1965. I don't know if
it was the first.

David,

Your list is absolutely breathtaking, and your analyses of Richard the Third
and the writer as the script writer and director, directing the audience,
even more.

All the while, I was wondering when you'll get to Naked Lunch with the
type-wrier from out of space. You made it in the last paragraph.

What about Under the Volcano or Moby Dick (Call me Ishmael, the narrator
begins) or The Great Gatsby or Dashiell Hammet's Continental Ops series? Or,
Andre Gide's The Counterfeiters?

Ciao,

Murat

Hi, Luke Schlueter here.  I'm new to this listserv having happily =
stumbled upon it as I was looking for a forum to discuss poetics. =20
=20
I embarked upon this search with a specific purpose in mind.  In a =
letter to Harriet Monroe Ezra Pound famously stated that "poetry should =
be as well written as prose."  I use the line in an academic paper I'm =
writing having to do with the poetry of Stephen Dunn, but it occurred to =
me that I am basing my use of Pound's statement on an assumption about =
what Pound meant, which may be entirely wrong.
=20
I would be very interested, then, to hear what some of you may have so =
say about the set of historical/cultural/aesthetic assumptions =
underlying Pound's statement.  What were the specific conditions of =
poetry and prose that he was responding to?  What excellence did he =
imagine prose to enacting, and what lack of excellence poetry?  Who were =
some prose writers he had in mind?  Was he thinking of essayists? or =
novelists?  Or both?=20
=20
So we'll see if this topic has legs.
=20
Best,
Luke

Dear David,

 Jews all over the world are now celebrating Hanukah, a commemoration
of a military victory over a ruler who had banned the religion of the
people of Judea and had ransacked the Holy Temple. Against
overwhelming odds, the Maccabian revolt prevailed.

 In times where hope seems to be in short supply, we can take
encouragement from this story. As the forces of occupation, violence
and conflict seem to be getting more and more entrenched, it is
important that we recall that the story of Hanukah is one of many
stories in human history of people triumphing over seemingly
overwhelming odds.

 Although the High Court in Israel has once again delayed the Israeli
government from reducing power to the Gaza Strip, the plan to do so
has been essentially approved and is only days away from being
enacted. Indeed, in an ironic twist, it may yet still begin during
Hanukah, which is sometimes referred to as the "Festival of Lights."

 The threat to cut power to Gaza is being held up until the government
can "prove" that this will not unduly impact the civilian population
of Gaza. But the fuel supply cut can only have one effect, and that is
to harm the people of Gaza. It does nothing to deter rocket fire from
Gaza, and will only convince the Palestinian people, in both Gaza and
the West Bank, of what they already suspect--that Israel's willingness
to participate in peace talks is merely a smokescreen for tightening
the occupation and the siege of Gaza.

 For so many of us, this is the season of holidays. We at Jewish Voice
for Peace wish you a happy holiday season and hope you will join us in
reminding the world that there are no holidays for the besieged people
of Gaza or any Palestinians living under the yoke of occupation. We
ask you to join us in calling on the United States to work to stop
Israel from deepening the already devastating humanitarian crisis in
Gaza, to end tech American and Israeli isolation of Gaza and to work
to bring the Palestinian factions back together so that a
representative Palestinian government can work toward resolving this
conflict and ending the occupation, which is so devastating to
Palestinians and is hurting Israelis as well.



 Wishing you and your family a happy holiday season,
 The members, board and staff of Jewish Voice for Peace

I've found one Creeley citation of his Pasteur movie
anecdote, from his Collected Essays, (which is on-line
and searchable), from his essay "Inside Out"
(dedicated to Jane Brakhage). You'll see it's his wife
(early 70s essay, so Bobbie Louise Hawkins--or first
wife Anne?) who told him about the movie, which sounds
like a wild comedy--the doctor actually says "Tonight
history was made". Creeley's talking about
autobiography and says:

Or, paradoxically, it may have little at all to do
with memory. Or let's say, memory is a source of
material, fantasy as well as fact. I remember! "I
remember, I remember/ the house where I was born . .
." Like a movie my wife told me of in the old days, of
doctor coming home in carriage with horse through
driving rain, finally pushing his way through door
into house, wife all excited and waiting for his first
words, which are: Tonight history was made. I have
just delivered Louis Pasteur!
_________________________

Excuse my awkward prose after Creeley's, but let me
say this: I think it's something of a struggle,
frankly, to apply the anecdote to the context Creeley
provides. Hmmmmm.  Something about memory being
altered by what one learns later, I guess, so that for
instance a doctor who delivered a
later-to-be-acclaimed human might at some later point
begin to *imagine* he experienced portents of the
person's importance from the start.

Dear All

New Zealand has chosen Michele Leggott as the country's first Poet =
Laureate,
happy news not only for her word-caressing poetry but also for
the attention to the NZEPC, the New Zealand Electronic Poetry Centre

For 2008-2009, Michele will officially foster New Zealand poetries =

  A Fiction Query Letter From Victorian Literature
The following is from Trollope's short story "Josephine De Montmorenci." It's a fictional example of breaking all the query letter rules and simply trying to catch the attention of an editor. In this story, it worked.

  Dear Sir,

I think that literature needs no introduction, and judging of you by the character which you have made for yourself in its paths, I do not doubt but you will feel as I do. I shall therefore write to you without reserve. I am a lady not possessing that modesty which should make me hold a low opinion of my own talents, and equally free of that feeling of self belittlement which induces so many to speak humbly while they think proudly of their own acquirements. Though I am still young, I have written much for the press, and I believe I may boast that I have sometimes done so successfully. Hitherto, I have kept back my name, but I hope soon to be allowed to see it on the title page of a book which shall not shame me.

My object in troubling you is to announce the fact, agreeable enough to myself, that I have just completed a novel in three volumes, and to suggest to you that it should make its first appearance to the world in the magazine under your control. I will frankly tell you that I am not fond of this mode of publication; but Messrs. X., Y., and Z., of Paternoster Row, with whom you are doubtless acquainted, have assured me that such will be the better course. In these matters, one is still terribly subject to the tyranny of the publishers, who surely of all cormorants are the most greedy, and of all tyrants, are the most arrogant. Though I have never seen you, I know you too well to suspect for a moment that my words will ever be repeated to my respectable friends in the Row.

Shall I wait upon you with my manuscript, - or will you call for it? Or perhaps it may be better that I should send it to you. Young ladies should not run about, - even after editors; and it might be so probable that I should not find you at home. Messrs. X., Y., and Z. have read the manuscript., - or more probably the young man who they keep for the purpose has done so, - and the nod of approval has been vouchsafed. Perhaps this may suffice; but if a second examination be needful, the work is at your service.

Yours faithfully, and in hopes of friendly relations,

Josephine De Montmorenci

Varese as mimicked on Zappa's magnificent "Lumpy

I'd like to see a biopic of Capt. Beefheart.

Murat & David

Want to add Antonioni's La Notte to this fabulous list.
Didn't Mastroianni play a writer too in Fellini's 8.5 ?

A good subject for discussion, Luke, as in 'what is poetry?'. [As an aside,
I believe that the English language has done itself a disservice by not
incorporating the inverse question mark and exclamation mark as has been
included in the Spanish language. This grammatical convention serves to
indicate where in the sentence the question or excitement starts recognizing
as it does that not the entire sentence is necessarily the question or
excitement.] It is unfortunate, Luke, that you did not state your opinion as
to what Pound meant.
I have always viewed Pound's statement as his manifesto against Romantic era
poetry with its high-blown hyperbole and its clashing (as in the sound
symbols make when slapped together) climaxes. Possibly also a reaction
against rhyme, as used by the Romantics, in the sense that an overemphasis
on rhyme distorted/contorted language in order to achieve its effect. It may
also have been his recognition of the superior poetics of Marianne Moore
whom Pound held in very high regard. If we accept William Carlos Williams'
criticism of Pound's language as being a failed attempt to construct an
American language (Williams also viewed Eliot as a traitor to America for
Eliot's acceptance of the British 'accent' in his writing foregoing his
native Americanism), this failed attempt was to construct a poetic language
based on prose. It is evident from the poetic language Williams' used that
he agreed with Pound as to the necessity for constructing an American poetry
based on the American idiom, he just didn't feel that Pound succeeded at
this.

Subject: " poetry . . .as well written as prose"

Hi, Luke Schlueter here.  I'm new to this listserv having happily stumbled
upon it as I was looking for a forum to discuss poetics.

I embarked upon this search with a specific purpose in mind.  In a letter to
Harriet Monroe Ezra Pound famously stated that "poetry should be as well
written as prose."  I use the line in an academic paper I'm writing having
to do with the poetry of Stephen Dunn, but it occurred to me that I am
basing my use of Pound's statement on an assumption about what Pound meant,
which may be entirely wrong.

I would be very interested, then, to hear what some of you may have so say
about the set of historical/cultural/aesthetic assumptions underlying
Pound's statement.  What were the specific conditions of poetry and prose
that he was responding to?  What excellence did he imagine prose to
enacting, and what lack of excellence poetry?  Who were some prose writers
he had in mind?  Was he thinking of essayists? or novelists?  Or both?

So we'll see if this topic has legs.

Best,
Luke

Hi Everyone,

Every morning I'm posting videos of music and (when possible) poetry from a=
round the world as part of a project "Around the World in 80 Days" to:

http://garysullivan.blogspot.com

Since I began, a friend has made some great suggestions about videos from o=
ne upcoming country that I would never have otherwise known about.

So I thought I would ask all of you: Do you know of anything really amazing=
 from one of the countries listed below? It has to be something I can embed=

The young shooter of Omaha is mentioned with such statements by reporters,
"We're such a violent nation," true, but then they go on with comparisons to
Virginia Tech, or Columbine.

Which makes sense.  But shouldn't they also be saying, "Yes, look at what
we're doing in Iraq!"

"We're such a violent nation, I mean look at what we're doing in Iraq!
Almost a million people dead!"

No one says this.  It's taboo.

Pound generally thought that, at least since Flaubert, prose writers,
or the best of them, were writing work that was harder, less
wasteful, less caught up in "filling the measure," than poetry. From
Flaubert through Henry James to James Joyce, he thought prose was the
thing. He did not much care for any 19th Century poetry until perhaps
Yeats, though the very young Pound had an affinity for Swinburne, and
he certainly had push/pull relationships with the work of Whitman &
Browning. He genuinely seemed to admire the work of Thomas Hardy,
though I'm not sure if he admired him more as a prose writer or poet.
In terms Pound would develop for his values in poetry (such as in his
essay, "The Hard and Soft in French Poetry"), he felt those values to
be more evident in the best prose of the preceding century.

Hi Luke

Well, I don't know, really, what Pound meant and in what circumstances he
said that. But I know someone who might have knew that and, in fact,
expanded a little that Pound's frase.

George Oppen, added to it: "... it should also be as good as dead silence."

Cheers
David

Thanks very much to all who responded on and off the list concerning
print-on-demand options.

Offlist, someone had good things to say about Trafford. Trafford is in my
town. So in addition to BookMobile.com, will also be looking at Trafford. As
Mark mentioned, the benefits of a local publisher can be important--if they
can handle colour vispo well and aren't too cookie cutter.

Will also be looking at these URLs--thanks Andrew.

Pound got his dictum from Ford Madox Hueffer (subsequently Ford). In his ob=
it for Ford, he wrote that "for the ten years before I got to England there=
 would seem to have been no one but Ford who held that French clarity and s=
implicity in the writing of English verse and prose were of immense importa=
nce as in contrast to the use of a stilted traditional dialect, a 'language=
 of verse' unused in the actual talk of the people, even of 'the best peopl=
e', for the expression of reality and emotion." Thus, "prose" here means, e=
ssentially, the tradition of Flaubert, and the condition of poetry he was r=
esponding to was that of late Victorian verse--he specifically mentions Rob=
ert Bridges and "the useful, but monotonous, in their day unduly neglected,=
 as more recently unduly touted, metrical labours of G. Manley Hopkins." An=
d he also mentions his own early efforts, "when my third volume displayed m=
e trapped, fly-papered, gummed and strapped downin a jejune
 provincial effort to learn...the stiled language that then passed for 'goo=
d English' in the arthritic milieu that held control of the respected Briti=
sh critical circles."=0A=0A=0A----- Original Message ----=0AFrom: Luke Schl=

This seems to be an endless discussion among publishers. I printed at
books with most of the Michigan short-run houses, including
Thomson-Shore. Like Bookmobile (I did one book with them) and
Sterling-Pierce, they all have difficulty hitting the spine
spot-on--if the cover is colored and the spine white there's often a
sliver of color at the edge of the spine. Any mechanized binder seems
to have that problem. Thomson-Shore delivered 1200 copies of one book
with a small tear on the bpttom of every spine--an unnoticed spot of
glue on the guillotine, they said. I had to fight with them to redo
the book, and had to wait three weeks to get the new press run.
Sterling-Pierce screwed up the color for the cover of Charles'
book--they failed to follow their own proof. A personnel problem.
They cheerfully redid the book in two days. And I don't think Charles
is unhappy with the book's appearance.

Most of us know Sterling's work--they handle all but first printings
of a lot of the major houses, incluuding, as I understand, New Directions.

The only printer about whom I have no reservations is Friessens.
Thoroughly professional, great quality control. I haven't used them
for POD, but I suspect they're just as good at it. And they can do
any kind of binding in-house. But local access trumps all that for
me, and the personal relationship that comes with it: if I have a
problem with a proof I talk directly with the guy on the computer who
was responsible for generating it.

Digital printing (which we all lazily refer to as POD) still carries
a bad rep from its early days, when the binding was truly lousy and
the colors were unpredictable. The technology, and, at good houses,
the level of care, has improved enormously. It probably will continue
to do so, and choices will broaden. My guess is that in ten years it
will have largely replaced all but the art-book quality offset houses
like Steinour and Meriden, which few of us use because we can't afford them.

The best recent (current) film I know about a writer and writing is called "Starting In The Evening".  It's about an imaginary writer but Frank Langella's performance as the elderly, out of print novelist who is rediscovered by a young graduate student should win him an academy award.  This is a great film, it just opened recently, and it made me cry, something I never do at movies.  See it, if you can.  Regards, Tom Savage

Dear Friends of SPT,

Thanks to everyone who has helped to make our membership drive such a
success!  Since October, we have earned more in membership
contributions than we did during all of last year. Thanks so much for
your support!  To meet our current membership drive goals, we are
still hoping to enroll 18 more new or renewed members by December
31st.  If you haven't already, join us!

In the short time that I have been with Small Press Traffic as the
Interim Director, my admiration for the organization and the work we
do has continued to grow.  SPT helps make public and promote ideas and
concerns that otherwise are not represented by the mainstream media.
In a time of staunch conservatism, of rampant misinformation and
widespread withholding by our leaders, and in an atmosphere where
materialism and ambition often override the human, SPT offers a vital,
creative forum for dissent, for relation, and for difference.

Please keep Small Press Traffic in mind for your end-of-the-year
giving. Your membership donation to SPT is tax-deductible and grants
you free admission to all of our events, as well as a subscription to
Traffic, our fearless and fabulous journal. You can join/renew on-line
or print a snail mail membership form by visiting:
http://www.sptraffic.org/html/supporters.htm. There really is no
better time! Those who join or renew their memberships by December 31,
2007 will receive archival broadsides from our vintage collection.

Thanks again everyone & we'll see you in 2008!

All best.

Dana Teen Lomax
Interim Director

Miekal,

Doesn't Vladimir Markov's book on Futurism date Huts? I know he  discusses
it. This title is not accessible for me to check right now. I bet it's  in your
library though. I have always loved this book, especially for the large
number of photographs of the works under discussion.

There are some wonderful books by Guro that are perpetually for sale at a
very reasonable price on ABE. I salivate every so often when I look at  them.

Does anyone know where a copy of the Livshits _Wolves of the Sun_ may be
obtained? I sort of consider that one the Holy Grail of poetry. I figure it's
buried in some Russian archive and probably one other attic where the squirrels
are keeping the babies warm with poetic genius.

When will there be  a kind of "Subterranean Blues"  "Dylan
detournement" / "Highway 61 Revisited" detour film about the Nuggets
and Pebbles-anthologized Fauxk Rockers  Mouse/Mouse and the Traps?
Something to lighten up the seriousness--
(is their any footage of Dylan's high school rock band?--young Bob at
home learning guitar from Esteban dvds?--a psychedelic "electri-fried"
Trip through Dylanania . . . exploring the little known Lee Harvey
Oswald connection--how Dylan later died in the motorcycle crash and
was replaced with a double . . . or maybe the "real" Dylan is living
quietly somewhere as a partially disabled somewhat brain damaged "nice
neighbor" peacefully "cultivating his own garden" among Voltairean
--as opposed to Baudelairean-- flowers?--"unearthed" someday by a
tabloid-addled psychic researcher--and brought "back to life" as a
musical and lyrical cousin of Daniel Johnson?--even having shows of
his "naive" paintings--and getting to meet and play with the "Bob
Dylan" of world wide fame--doing a "Reunion" Concert and CD?--playing
at "Always Wear Your Helmet" rallies . . . going to see old friends
like Joan Baez for the cameras . . . and writing, with a ghost
writer--"Another Side of Bob Dylan"?--as an in-crowd in-joke homage to
"his" fans . . . the ones of the "real Bob Dylan"--)

Mouse and the Traps-
The Sixties garage punk cult classic Texas band whose 1966 "A Public
Execution" (released  simply as by "Mouse") was in "a simple twist of
fate"  produced by Robin Hood Brians at his Robin Hood
studio--(meaning occultically that Dylan is the Sheriif of
Nottingham?--)
"Execution"   is an uncannily Dylanesque "parody/homage of the "Like A
Rolling Stone" period Bob--lead singer Randy Weiss sounding so like
Dylan the unsuspecting ask--"is it real or is it Bob Dylan?"     to
music complete with harmonica and all the fixin's--

Members of the band later released a single under the band name
"Postively 13 O'Clock"--
parody/homage in name only of the "Postively Fourth Street" Dylan . . .

At least Randy Weiss (aka "Mouse") never claimed that Dylan was imitating HIM!
Unlike the Chocolate Watchband singer who harbored a serious delusion
that Mick Jagger had ripped him off--
Some Watchband songs do sound almost too  eerily like the Stones of of
the 1965-6 period--they also did a great version of Dylan's "Baby
Blue" and a much punkier version of the Kinks' "Medication" than the
Standells, with whom they for while shared producer Ed Cobb (author of
the Standells', now Red Sox Nation anthem "Dirty Water."

Hi, friends! As part of the "9 Poets 9 Cities" project
http://9poets9cities.blogspot.com
I invite you to attend* the Brooklyn B-63 5th Avenue bus reading!*

This Sunday (December 9), from 10 AM until 2:30 PM*,  *poetry will happen***
* along the B-63 route -- nine poems, that is, by nine poets, each read at
their own unique location... by Jen Coleman.

If you want to bear live witness to this historical happening, see the
times, locations, and poems to be read at this blog site:

http://brooklyn9by9.blogspot.com

And if you wish you could see the poems by nine poets from around the world,
as read on the street in Brooklyn, but you don't want to wander around in
the cold from Fort Hamilton to Park Slope all day on Sunday December 9, stay
tuned: *the YouTube version of the reading will appear on January 1st!*

 I read recently in the Times (London) that the top five or so novels in Japan were created and read on mobiles. One critic thought it was the slippery road to illiteracy, others think it will help to keep text going. I always wonder about the future - Mircea Eliade wrote in a journal the best novel is the one you will do -- not the one you have done or are working on - of course Rob needs to be congratulated for his novel - but I thought of the poem of the future, whether it will be text or images. The Japanese language with its origins in Chinese has a clear advantage as it can cross over into art - like Arabic script - but our alphabet? - This keitai novel also made me think of the levels of poetics, the possibility that a poem might be like an archaelogical artefact, you could dig deeper and deeper through past text messages and these would add to the effect. I write this after experimenting with "crashing" pub talk into Thomas Browne's Meditations, seeing how some of his

phraseology and words could wind themselves around the chatter and gossip of a pub evening. Never get drunk while reading John Milton's Paradise Lost, by the way - I know someone who did -- with funny results...Stephen Philip Pain, MPhilwww.biorhetorics.1go.dkkongensgade 15 1-sal,5000 Odense C.Denmark.Tel: +45 66 12 06 22

Ford would have been close to the top of his list of examples quite likely. IE

I've just been studying some Levertov and came across these words:
"Contemplation - meditation - the words are taken from the religious
vocabulary, and surely this is no accident; for we should remember the
ritual, sacramental roots of art and realize that the act of creating a =
work
of art is in its nature a celebration of life...and that the artists =
himself
has a function not very different from that of the priest of shaman.
...It is a testimony of that 'participation mystique', that involvement =
of
the individual in a life beyond himself, which is a basic element of
religion in the broadest and deepest sense. The poem communicates =
something
more of life to the receiver than he would have without it, and the poet =
is
the mediator or priest in this rite of communion, in which, as in =
Christian
communion, he himself participates also as a receiver."
Her thoughts tie in to some that I have had over the past while. Is the
poet, or, more broadly, the creative artist, the shaman of contemporary
society? Is the process of creating a poem similar to that of a =
vipassana,
i.e. mindfulness, meditation? What is the role of the creative artist in
society now that 'art-for-arts-sake' is pass=E9?

SHELLEY JACKSON is the author of the recent novel HALF LIFE, as well as =
the
short story collection THE MELANCHOLY OF ANATOMY.  She is perhaps best =
known
for her hypertext novel PATCHWORK GIRL, and she has also authored a =
short
story, SKIN, published in tattoos on the skin of some two thousand
volunteers.  LA WEEKLY once called her "a queerer Don DeLillo, or a =
sassier
Pynchon."  See her website http://www.ineradicablestain.com for more.

JESSICA SMITH is the author of ORGANIC FURNITURE CELLAR.  Originally =
from
Birmingham, Alabama, she received her MA in Comparitive Literature from =
SUNY
Buffalo, where she participated in the Poetics Program and started the
poetry magazine NAME.  She now lives in Charlottesville, VA, but is in =
the
process of moving to Brooklyn.  She edits OUTSIDE VOICES, which will
publishing a much-anticipated Anthology Of Younger Poets sometime in =
2008.
Christian B=F6k says: "Jessica Smith refuses to write like lyric poets, =
who
merely rearrange the furniture of language in their rooms; instead, she
makes her language skid 'every which way' like an office chair kicked =
across
a parquet floor."

Michael O'brien and I used to be friends in the sixties on Columbia
University campus. He even tried to improve one of my poems at that time, to
no avail. A phrase from one of his poems of the time sticks to my mind:
"Cleveland Platonists." This is the strangest review I saw. Is New York
Times congratulating itself that this review will rescue Michael O'brien
from obscurity?

Ciao,

If I remember correctly, T. S.Eliot states the same, or something close to
it, in one of his essays. He is attacking the vagueness of thought and
language the poetry of the time (the Edwardian stuff) was suffering from.

Well, *The Dream Songs* (John Berryman) is considered a book length poem, as
is James Schuyler's *Morning Of The Poem *and Joe Brainard's *I Remember*.
Though  can't say what the absolute longest is.

bpNichol's MARTYROLOGY perhaps, if you're counting pages.
If you're counting words: maybe Kenneth Goldsmith's DAY?

Well, *The Dream Songs* (John Berryman) is considered a book length poem, as
is James Schuyler's *Morning Of The Poem *and Joe Brainard's *I Remember*.
Though  can't say what the absolute longest is.

Hi Everyone,

So I thought I would ask all of you: Do you know of anything really amazing
from one of the countries listed below? It has to be something I can embed
into the blog itself.
...

United Kingdom
>>

Strictly, the United Kingdom isn't one country (what it is -- a
conglomeration? -- I'm not sure what the term should be) but a collection of
four -- Scotland, England, Wales, and [Northern] Ireland.

I don't know whether videos of them exist, but for Scotland, Tom Leonard
performing "My Name Is Tom" or Edwin Morgan reading "The Loch Ness Monster's
Song" spring to mind.

yes, i remember someone writing that after columbine--we point fingers at

Flowchart by John Ashbery. Sure. not just by sheer size (at 216 pages) but I
would argue it is one of the finest long poems written in modern times.

I don't think either of those is as long as either The Cantos or The
Maximus Poems. I would imagine bpNichol's 9-volume The Martyrology
would have to enter the conversation as being possibly the longest,
but there must be others as well. One of them, perhaps, Frank
Stanford's 524-page The Battlefield Where the Moon Says I Love you?

Also, are you going to measure "longest" by number of lines, number
of pages, word count, or what? If by pages, mss. pages or printers'
pages?

Can a very tiny short poem be long? Why not!

James Merrill's _The Changing Light at Sandover_ is certainly a
contender, but my bet would be Hugh MacDiarmid's collection of long
works (In Memoriam James Joyce, "The Kind of Poetry I Want," etc.) that
was to comprise his _Cornish Heroic Song_ that was supposed to be "the
long poem ever written by one individual" according to Eliot Weinberger
in his intro to _MacDiarmid's Selected Poetry_.

"In Parenthesis" by David Jones is a very long prose poem. "The Cantos" is probably as long as Berryman's "The Dream Songs." & has anyone mentioned "The Changing light at Sandover." Merrill's poem, I'm almost certain, is longer than "Flow Chart." Merwin's recent "The Folding Cliffs" is also an epic, but not as long as the Merrill poem. On the other hand, I have none of these books in front of me. I not certain which one is the longest, although I'd bet on Merrill's poem.

I forgot to mention "The Triumph of Love" by Geoffrey Hill. This poem may not be as lengthy as those I've mentioned on my previous post, but it's worth looking at. Besides, it's an example of a non-American 20th century long poem written in English.

Adding on - may not be the longest, but Lawrence Ferlinghetti's last book
Americus II is the continuation of his previous book length poem Americus I
celebrating in ageless lyric the history of the New World.

Also not to forget Amiri Baraka's near book-length 9-11 poem Somebody Blew
Up America.

Susan, interesting question.  I kept correspondences with a couple  famous
people, as you say, a writer and an editor, until it seemed we were  through w/
it.  It was pleasant and enlightening while it was taking  place.  These are
people I'd had every reason to be in touch w/, but also I  admired both
tremendously.  I was younger and more impressionable than now  and very earnest about
creative work and teaching.  The same writer will  still write to me today,
if I write to her, wh. has been rare -- once in 12  years at most.  That editor
might write to me again -- it seemed his  pattern to reply to correspondence.
 When I have written a pure fan letter,  as I did once in college to Christa
Wolf, she replied auf Deutsch, which I could  read w/ ease, though I had read
her books in English translation.   Otherwise, in the rest of my experience
and in my opinion, it can be weird out  there where correspondence is concerned.
 People (also writers and  teachers)  who had urged me to contact them,
really urged it, claimed  friendship, etc., have sometimes not replied to a letter
I sent.  I send  one letter, and if there is no reply, as has happened two or
three times, I  stop.  I once conducted a very long correspondence w/ a new
but in my  opinion very good writer I had met at school.  It was kooky,
especially on  my end, bec. I was using our correspondence to hone paragraphs and
sentences  after a long hiatus and going against my tendency to write minimally, a
tendency  she remembered.  Imagine her surprise, when I started sending long
block  paragraphs -- my paragraphs used to look nothing like that, were more
like scant  poems -- pages long, in email, daily!  She was good enough to keep
up w/ it  and let me ramble.  It was essay I was writing to her, really, and
there  are reams of it.  I'd like to have an editor take a look at it and pull
a  book out of it.  Her letters were daily, too, and described soup she cooked
 and hikes she took and eventually her courtship and new baby.  In close
friendships, I let the other person decide how much or how little email we'll
write together, because of my tendency to write too much (in the past), and  w/
the realization that busy lives -- busy w/ books and print -- sometimes
preclude too much extra writing.  This is so true especially for writers,  who may
wish to save their writing energy for books.  Also, there is a  privacy issue
at stake in personal correspondence, one that I won't go into here  except to
say I usu. save but do not forward mail written to me nor would I  touch for
publishing purposes someone's else's work in letters.  I didn't  realize
writers and editors were famous ahead of time.  I thought if you  had to explain who
they were, they weren't famous, but that isn't true.   One more note, I have
sent fan material to a famous musician, and he doesn't  write back, but I used
to see him around, and we'd always greet.   AMB

"WORKSHOP: AVATAR PASTE AND CODE SOUP IN FIRST AND SECOND LIFE
"14:00-18:00 www.secondlife.com - FREE book via email to drp01mc (at)
"gold.ac.uk
"Leaders: ASS. PROF. SANDY BALDWIN, West Virginia University & ALAN
"SONDHEIM

This workshop will take place in the virtual world Second Life, and will
be conducted by Alan Sondheim and Sandy Baldwin, with participation by
other artists and performers in Second Life.

Participants from the Intimacy conference will be supplied with location
and others details within Second Life. The workshop emerges from Sondheim
and Baldwin's ongoing exploration of analog and digital bodies, using a
range of technologies to remap the solid and obdurate real of bodies into
the dispersions and virtualities of the digital, and then back again into
real physical spaces. The "avatar paste" of the title means at least three
things.

Firstly, the pasting of viewpoints together, the suturing of the subject
into the avatar. Secondly, paste as glue, as half-liquid and half solid,
as a materiality of renewable and infinite pliability. This is the chora
of the avatar, the body matrix that is less a framework than a smearing of
paste. And thirdly, paste as pasty and dis/comfortable substance, paste as
slimy and dripping. While this abjection is already implicit in paste as
glue, the pastiness of paste involves the projection and dreaming through
of the avatar, the inhabitation of avatar bodies and the emptying of real
bodies into the avatar.

"Avatar paste" comes out in avatar motions and behaviors. Firstly, these
are formed by symbolic orders, presenting surfaces to read in terms of
sexuality, power, emotion, and other projections. At the same time, the
pasty avatar body tends towards collapse and abjection. Work on the avatar
becomes a choreography of exposure and rupture, modeling and presenting
inconceivable and untenable data, within which tensions and relationships
are immediate and intimate. One might imagine, then, this inconceivable
data as a form of organism itself: as part of a natural world or a world
already given; out of this we might think through new ideas of landscape,
wilderness, hard ecology, the earth itself.

The workshop will theorize and demonstrate these topics. The first part
discusses theoretical frameworks. Alan Sondheim will introduce the topic
of dismemberment and telepresence in terms of the presence or appearance
of abjection in Second Life avatars. He will connect this to the
epistemology of emptiness vis-a-vis sheave theory and Buddhist philosophy,
and then to the problems of motion and behavior of avatars. Sandy Baldwin
will discuss the topography of limits in Second Life, both body limits and
spatial limits, an connect this to issues of the hunt and animal display.

He will also discuss the dynamics of performance and audience in Second
Life. The second part of the workshop will show off Sondheim and Baldwin's
approach to re-mapping live bodies into Second Life performances, includ-
ing: video and other examples of motion capture and scanning; intermediate
processing of files (e.g. editing .bvh data or working with Blender); and
then the resulting works, including documents of Second Life performances
and re-mappings back into "first life" spaces with dancers and other live
performers. The final part of the workshop will include avatar performance
by Sondheim, Baldwin, and other participants in Second Life.

It's probably something written by someone schizophrenic none of us has  ever
heard of in a room somewhere that he or she rarely leaves...maybe it's
brilliant and maybe it's just maddening writing, but that's where my mental  money
is going...my riend David (who was schizophrenic...he later just vanished)
could sometimes write 200 pages of poetry or prose in a weekend (of course he
usually destroyed this two weeks later when the voices told him to)....he would
 usually start this by getting a pile of like fifteen books of philosophy
from  the State Library....the little bits of his writing he would let me read
sort of  sent me into alternate brain waves instantly but then he'd snap the
notebooks  shut...how much of this was plagiarism or reverbigeration I have no
idea....but  i've always filed those kinds of occurrences under the rubric of
angelism or  manic angelism...kind of like muhammad hearing that chiming of the
bell in the  cave that went on and on, continuously chiming and speaking at
the same  time...I'm thinking along the lines of a Darger (although that's
slightly  different)...that kind of obsession can go for decades....but as to known
long  poems by recognized poets...how long is A? does it beat the Cantos in
page  count...certainly it beats them in splendor...is there a hidden English
or  American Mahabharata that generations of poets have been hiding? Now would
be  the time to bring it out. :-)

Dear Murat--

in honor of the birth of the new child  who "is born" of the subject title--
here is a quote from the one for whom that child was father to the man--


"Where observation is concerned, chance favors only the prepared mind."

-- Louis Pasteur

Many thanks for your kinds words.
I had to stop listing films as if one doesn't-- . . .
Also thank you to Barry for reminding me the name of the film I
mentioned with Humphrey Bogart as the screenplay writer is In a Lonely
Place, a Nicholas Ray masterpiece--

There's also Schrader's Mishima, Godard's Le Mepris (Contempt, from
the Moravia novel--writer Michel Piccoli is hired to do a screenplay
for a new film version of The Odyssey, to be directed by Fritz Lang,
who quotes "BB"( Bertolt Brecht) as a joke on "BB" Brigite Bardot who
plays Piccoli's wife and finds contempt for him for selling out his
talents to Ugly American producer Jack Palance)

and a not particularly good but fun film "about" the Marquis de Sade
(played by with great bravado by Jeremy Rush)--a joke in this film is
that each time the Marquis is about to write--in a descending order of
ink, wine, blood, feces--he hums delightedly "Au Clair de la
lune"--which has the well known lines "pretes ma ta plume/pour ecrire
un mot"-literally---"bring me your quill/so I can write a word"--
(which song ever since seeing the film i often find myself humming or
singing when setting to work--)

there are hundreds more writers in films-----

re Hammett--a very interesting film could be made not only about him,
but about a sort of series of reincarnations of the public/private
investigator turned writer of detective stories--and, in Hammett's
case, not only directly affected cinema, but also radio series and
comic strips literally drawn from his characters--and in which he had
hand--

(Wim Wenders made the fictional Hammett (1982)--Hammett involved in
solving a murder-)

Hammett had been an employee of the Pinkerton Agency--which furnished
the "Continental Op" with a lot of the material in his early stories
and his first novel, the great Red Harvest--

his first assignment was to find a missing Ferris wheel--
disappeared from a carnival in his native Maryland--

Pinkerton himself had been also a writer of detective and crime novels--
though not the first of these--

(reacting to things he had witnessed while working for Pinkerton, the
agency often employed against labor strikes and leaders--Hammett
became a Communist and though having served in WW2 as an Army
newspaper editor and being a vet of WW1--later served prison  time in
the ugly HUAC year--in the film Julia, supposedly based on Lillian
Hellman's controversial/supposed memoirs, Hammett, her lover of 30
years, is portrayed by Jason Robards)


The original of both the historical and fictional  police detective,
private detective, master criminal and detective story writer  is
Eugene Francois Vidocq, (1775-1857)  one the most extraordinary persons anytime,
anywhere, whose biography, inventions, influences singlehandedly have
affected profoundly history, literature, cinema, radio, comics --the
world over--

as  criminal and police detective, Vidocq inspired BOTH Javert and
Jean Valjean in Hugo's Les Miserables, as criminal, Balzac's Vautrin,
(Balzac is reputed to have contributed writing to one of Vidocq's own
crime novels) and as the founder of the first private detective
agency, provided a model for Poe's Dupin and Doyle's
Sherlock Holmes.--

He's discussed in Poe's "Murders in the Rue Morgue" and Melville's Moby Dick--
and inspired the escaped convict turned benefactor in Dickens'  Great
Expectations--

Vautrin was a renowned escape artist--once eluding the  guillotine
itself, at age 17--he had killed three guards too roughly dragging two
noble women to the guillotine-and been in turn sentenced to the same
fate-awaiting this in one the worst hell holes in France--

Acting on the axiom "it takes a thief to catch a thief"-while still an
unpardoned convict---he founded the Parisian Surete and later in life
Le Bureau des Renseignments--
the first private detective agency----( also a credit agency--)

he created modern criminology , introducing ballistics, the index file
system for information and records on  known criminals, the first use
of plaster molds for impressions of foot/shoe prints, inventing and
briefly manufacturing forge-proof paper and indelible ink, and
developed the use of undercover agents and training in surveillance
techniques-
-His
employment of  the most realistic disguise and acting in this
regard--he is probably one of the greatest actors never to have
appeared on stage--having been perfected  during years of being on the
run from the law--(at one point under the name of Rousseau)--

In his periods between flights Vidocq lived the life of a good
citizen--but when the past caught up to him, protean, he would be
forced to adopt another identity, another physical transformation, not
only in dress, speech, but gestures, gait, tics as well--molding
himself into an "other"--until detected by chance and again having to
chameleon-like change into yet another identity--

He was such a good actor that, as police detective infiltrating a gang
of super-robbers,
their leader enlisted him as his personal accomplice in the planned murder
of---none other than the great Vidocq himself!

With the gang leader, Vidocq awaited his own self to emerge from his own
concealed address, which the crime boss had somehow discovered---and
waited and waited--and, having failed to bump himself off,  was not
long after arresting his "boss"--appearing as his "real" self, Vidocq
the still living police detective--

Vidocq's memoirs were a huge bestseller in France, and a year later,
in England, inspiring  a whole series of popular stage
adaptations--and Charles Dickens--

One of Vidocq's methods was to employ and train almost entirely
ex-convicts he hand picked, a controversial move which resulted in his
being tried at one point for having betrayed his trust as Surete head
and, only acting his official part, returned to crime in a reverse
"undercover" operation--
      framed by jealous highers-up in the police hierarchy, the head
of the Surete was once again thrown into a hell hole--where many he
had arrested awaited him--when the trial finally took place, Vidocq
was acquitted, his reputation for honesty and good citizenship
intact--
      Vidocq was a popular hero of primarily the working
classes--despised and feared by
many in "higher circles" for his humble origins and his criminal past--

during the period of the "Restoration"--one of Vidocq's specialties
was the exposing and arrest of many returning "noblesse oblige"
poseurs supplied with false documents, forgeries, and who were
claiming privileges and the recovery of former wealth and estates not
their own--

In his hiring of ex-convicts, Vidocq was also a unique example of a
new form of philanthropist.

He was a believer in the innate goodness of humans, the reformation of
convicts and their restoral as "good citizens of France," based on the
example of himself.

Vidocq's life and crime novels and tales influenced also Eugene Sue
and Dostoyevsky. He also led to the founding, in England, of the first
collection/museum of crime and detective works, artefacts etc.

His life story in an any given year would make a film in
itself-(Vidocq, with Gerard Depardieu, 2001 i have yet to see--) -by
turns an honest businessman under assumed names, an heroic member of
Napoleon's fleet, a highly valued solider, a member of the worst
criminal circles, a forger, robber, single handed killer (at 14 he
accidentally killed a man in a duel--and, fleeing, began his outlaw
life--killing more in more duels along the way--)-and as-inmate and
escapee of some of the worst prisons of the times, a galley slave of
privateers--

Vidocq is the site of origin of a protean proliferation of continually
recurring series of authors, actors, disguises, alter egos, fictional
and real--of police detectives, private eyes, Continental ops, master
criminals, reformed criminals--shifting in and out of character as
writers of stories, novels, memoirs, non-fiction works and in turn
invading the cinema--tv-video games, comic strips, paintings--and real
life crime scenes--

Vidocq, who hid himself while on the lam and disguised his identity
undercover--the sought after and the seeker by turns--making a name
for himself by hiding under other names--this person who so frequently
sought an anonymity--has turned up for a hundred fifty years
--everywhere--on street corners, in offices, on shelves in
bookstores--on screens the world over--disguised as a police
detective, a criminal, a private eye, and undercover agent, an actor,
a writer--

Re Richard the III--in PBS' very good documentary series on the
History of Rock and Roll--(which interviews musicians only--no
pontificating critics and self serving producers)--
Johnny Lydon aka Rotten reveals that his stage style was completely
based on Olivier's performance in the film of the Shakespeare play--
clips of Olivier and Rotten are played one after the
other--and--indeed!! Johnny Rotten is the reincarnation of Richard the
Third as "captured on film"!--

For cannot one hear Johnny singing this proto-Vidoquian soliloquy of
disguise and literary allusions in his best "Anarchy in the
UK," "I am an anarchist/I am an Anti-Christ" voice:

Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
    And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
    And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
    And frame my face to all occasions.
    I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
    I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
    I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
    Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
    And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
    I can add colours to the chameleon,
    Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
    And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
    Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
    Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.

    and then "Anarchy in the UK"'s  final line:  "DESTROY"!!!!!!!!

Ted Enslin's FORMS is 602 pages
his SYNTHESIS is 490 pages
vol I of his RANGER is 430 pages (vol. 2 went awol from my shelves)
but I remember it as being a bit shorter then vol. 1, so it might well
bring the total RANGER to some 800 pages.

Vernon Frazer's IMPROVISATIONS is 697 pages

Charles Olson's MAXIMUS is 635 pages

Robert Kelly's LOOM is 415 pages

Allen Fisher's PLACE is 407 pages
The first two volumes of his GRAVITY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SHAPE come to
545 pages, with one further volume to come out, so that poem could top
800 pages.

Alice Notley's ALMA is 344 pages

Anne Waldman's IOVIS (vol. 1& 2) is  647 pages

Frank Samperi's trilogy (THE PREFIGURATION, QUADRIFARIAM & LUMEN
GLORIAE) should br considered a long poem. The pages are unumbered,
but the three vols shld come to between 500 and 600 pages.

The 3 volumes of Ed Sander's AMERICA, A HISTORY IN VERSE come to 1014
pages.

& I forget some.

I am thinking of teaching a freshman compostion class with a "hero and anti-hero" theme. Most of my students are not great readers, so it can't be a philosophical tome (although who knows? I may be surprised.) Does anyone have any good ideas for a book about or on "anti-hero"

  Thanks.

gloom.

gloom.
defuge.
the radio comes on in the room.
the radio whispers in the room.
it speaks the unspeakable.
i can't keep this up, it says.
this world is far too tired, it says.
the world can't do anything more.
the world tried over and over.
nothing worked.
the world is exhausted.
the world doesn't need the radio.
night. the computer's gone to sleep.
there's nothing online.
there never is.
there is no subsequence-consequence.
gloom of cold rain.
gloom of cold.
i don't want to touch myself.
i don't want to touch anything.
i sleep on this floor.
there are no noises in this place.
i know i am wise.
i am wise because there is no substance.
there is no consequence-subsequence.
there is nothing to release.
dead phone. keyboard disconnect.
defuge of supine body.
defuge of dead air.
defuge of radio whisper.
the floor is exhausted.
the ceiling is exhausted.
the wall is exhausted.
i leave the skin.
i take the skin.
the radio.

Mary,

I think Harold Lubin edited an anthology titled "Heroes and Anti-Heroes: A
Reader In-Depth." The book may be out of print, though, since I think it was
published in 1968 (somewhat before my time). I'll try and think of something
more contemporary/available.


Best,

Eric Weinstein

I am thinking of teaching a freshman compostion class with a "hero and anti-hero" theme. Most of my students are not great readers, so it can't be a philosophical tome (although who knows? I may be surprised.) Does anyone have any good ideas for a book about or on "anti-hero"

Notes from Underground, Dostoevsky, for a terrific example of anti-
hero. Influential, I think, on practically everything of anti-hero
since. And for a more "pop" approach, the Clint Eastwood Italian
westerns, i.e. A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, & The
Good, The Bad, & The Ugly. I am not up on critical works on the
notion of the "anti-hero."

Eric,
  I just checked the Lubin anthology on Amazon, and there are only a few copies floating around there. That is the kind of book that would work for my class (although it is probably outdated). I'll do a google search and see if I can find anything.

  Thank you.

  Mary

the new volume of:

Rachel Blau DuPlessis, DRAFTS, stands so  far at 625 pages distributed
over three volume.

Catcher in the Rye comes to mind, for that level of reading. If they're more
advanced, I'd say, A Fan's Notes, by Frederick Exley.

Please tune in to Ryerson University's CKLN-FM 88.1 (Toronto) on =
Tuesday, December 11, from 2-3 pm. I'll be guest-hosting In Other Words.

For this program, I'll play, side-by-side, folk traditions of sound =
singing with dada and other sound poetry performances: Annie Johnston, a =
Scottish woman doing bird imitations, alongside Giacomo Balla's futurist =
magical nonsense; Tuvan throat singers alongside contemporary sound poet =
Sainkho Namtchylak (some of these are from Jerome Rothenberg's wonderful =
Ethnopoetics anthology on ubu.com). I'll also feature works by mIEKAL =
aND, Funginii (Michael Basinski and friends), cris cheek, Jackson Mac =
Low and Anne Tardos, Robert Ashley, Vernon Frazer, and Robert Creeley =
with Lake Affect (or however much time will allow).

Here are a few things that I could add about the Omaha shootings.  Being a native Nebraskan I was aware that von Maur is the chic-est department store in the Omaha area.    To choose that particular store at the height of the consumer season seems significant.

Also Bush visited town and left shortly before the incident.  While that fact was mentioned on the news, the awareness that many people out there were pretty horrified that Bush fled to Offett Air Force base in Bellevue just south of Omaha during the September eleven attack is something that wouldn't fit in a news brief.

Context is not separate from what happened there, yet how do we know if/when it's accountable either?

Charles,
  Nor am I. I think that anti-hero can be defined in different ways. Clint Eastwood's movies are a good example. Roberto Bolano's Savage Detectives is a wonderful example, but it is very very long. (Very few of my students are readers. (sigh).

I want to second Exley's "A Fan's Notes." The prose is as lyrical as Fitzgerald's finest, but bawdier. It's a great book. I think someone has already mentioned "Crime & Punishment" & "Notes from the Underground." I read the Dostoevsky books in high school. They may have philosophical weight, but they're fun reads, perfectly compatible for the needs of intro students. There are a couple of Bukowski novels worth looking at. Check out "Ham ON Rye" or "Factotum." They're easy reads. The Buk's prose was simple & solid. His poetry was too often sloppy & monotonous.

advanced, I'd say, A Fan's Notes, by Frederick Exley.

Pick any novel by the late Larry Brown, ex fireman & Southern noveliest, & you'll get some excellent anti-heroes. Start with "Joe," his first novel.

Name another country where teens decide to step into immortality through the act of killing. We're violent. We're pathologically violent. We're simply weird.

Being a native Nebraskan I was aware that von Maur is the chic-est department store in the Omaha area.    To choose that particular store at the height of the consumer season seems significant.

Also Bush visited town and left shortly before the incident.  While that fact was mentioned on the news, the awareness that many people out there were pretty horrified that Bush fled to Offett Air Force base in Bellevue just south of Omaha during the September eleven attack is something that wouldn't fit in a news brief.

Context is not separate from what happened there, yet how do we know if/when it's accountable either?

I'd cast a vote for Gardner's *Grendel*. *Wuthering Heights* and
*Villette*might not be ideal candidates for a class that aren't "great
readers,"
although I did enjoy the former. If there's a sci-fi element at all, Stephen
Donaldson's *Chronicles of Thomas Covenant* are great.

Sorry, I'm behind on sleep. By "former" I meant "latter," and by "sci-fi" I
meant "fantasy."

Mary,

That's one advantage of Notes from Underground, i.e. it's not long,
though it's also not exactly "easy" reading. Detective fiction offers
anti-heroes, too, like Sam Spade.

My current favorite anti-hero is Dexter, from the Showtime series and the

Stephen Ratcliffe's long poem, beginning with Portraits and Repetition
(427 pp. / Post Apollo) and followed by Real (427 pp. / Avenue B) and
the unpublished third section Cloud/Ridge (427 pp.) clocks in at a
whopping 1281 pages! AND, get this: he just finished the next section,
Human/Nature, all 1000 pages of it. Combined, he's sitting on 2281
pages of magic, which certainly puts him in the running, at least for
the longest poem of the 21st century...

The hero of the hero and anti-hero dichotomy is Nietzsche, if read with some
attention he is simple, it depends again on the students' will to approach
him.
Great choice the one of Mr. Ripley! I just watched the movie which is quite
exceptional, by Minghella, script co-written with Highsmith. Otherwise:
Cormac McCarthy: Suttree and The Road.

Sorry, this poem belongs to the 21st century. I did not read the initial
question by Ric Carfagna.

Indeed, this is an interesting thread.

I wonder if being a poet is a calling similar to that of a shaman or a
priest.  There is certainly a "compulsion" that I feel to write--and have
felt since I was quite young.  It seems to me that other artists that I've
spoken to have had similar feelings about their work.

Does the notion "art for art's sake" need to be "passe"?

I think poetry is just art for art's sake. That is precisely why poets must always have another  profession to support them financially. But yes, maybe there is some spirituality involved because every person who reads a poem (a good one) feels elevated at some level. As far as compulsion is concerned, I dont see how that should be an index of anything as everyone who is passionate about something feels compelled to do something about it.

I wonder if being a poet is a calling similar to that of a shaman or a
priest. There is certainly a "compulsion" that I feel to write--and have
felt since I was quite young. It seems to me that other artists that I've
spoken to have had similar feelings about their work.

Does the notion "art for art's sake" need to be "passe"?

I don't understand what an "anti-hero" is in the first place. Is a coward
an anti-hero? Is it someone who faces off against a hero? Is it an abject
hero? What is the role of gender here? Too many males? I would think of an
anti-hero as a destructive and abject force that couldn't be pinned down;
heroes are almost always pointillist - she or he did this/did that; here
are the hero's deeds. We want our anti-heroes at this point; we seem to
think they're somehow beneath and within the social, correct the social;
their badness constructs the good; they give the lie to etiquette; they're
literary safety-valves for the social. But they're reified as much as any
other commodity, as much as the commodity of the heroic; one might say in
fact that anti-heroes are the heroic of the anti-social, not the anti-
heroic of the social. In any case the category is too comfortable, as is
hero. And don't forget we wiped Grendel to extinction like Stellar's sea-
cow. - Alan

These events say more about the focus of the media in the US than much
else.

There are tens of millions of teens in the US, many of whom are angry,
many of whom watch violent TV shows and movies, play violent video games
and/or listen to music about violence, many of whom dress like previous
shooters, many of whom get bullied in school or other situations, etc.
But still there are only a very small handful of teen shooting events in
any one year, If there've been even a thousand such events in the last
twenty years, I'd be surprised. These events are brutal, shocking,
inexpelicable, tragic, pointless, etc, but teen shooters are an anomaly,
statistically insignificant and the behaviors that are most commonly
described as "indicators" of these events are so much more common that
these behaviors can't have any causal relation or we'd have hundreds of
such events every month.

That said, I can think of several other countries where "teens decide to
step into immortality through the act of killing" (& you could too if
you thought about it).

I cried when I saw the Stockhausen obituary in the Times.  Two or three days later, I was thrilled by Carter's opera What's Next?" at the Miller Theater, written ten years ago when he was 90 or nearly so.  What's next, indeed?  He's still composing great works as he nears his own centenary.  Regards, Tom Savage

I wonder how many of these events are unreported or don't receive national attention when they occur in inner city "minority" schools.  The ones that take center stage involve white middle class "teens" --  but moreover, how many of these "teen" shooters are girls?

Herb Levy <herb@ESKIMO.COM> wrote:twenty years, I'd be surprised. These events are brutal, shocking,
inexpelicable, tragic, pointless, etc, but teen shooters are an anomaly,
statistically insignificant and the behaviors that are most commonly
described as "indicators" of these events are so much more common that these behaviors can't have any causal relation or we'd have hundreds of such events every month.

 The Death of Jim Loney by James Welch

Welch writes in a style i call "harsh lyricism."  The writing is very
spare, so that, in effect, nothing is spared.  It is so incisive a
style it cuts into one, and when reading it for the first time during
heat wave i felt i was freezing, and walked about in a coat.

Jim Loney is at the vanishing point where the hero and anti-hero
dissolve into a tragedy collapsing the ancestral/ancient and present
day into--a half-breed Indian's confronting the abyss.

Jim Loney is a half-breed in the sense also of being--torn between the
heroic and the anti-heroic--and faced with these "choices":  what is
it his "way out" of finding an impossible/possible balance?

The style is very accessible, simple and direct, very achingly
beautiful while also being very harsh and uncompromising.  I think it
is (deceptively) "easier to read' for non-readers than any of the
books mentioned, and as far as examining the hero/anti-hero in terms
of American myths as actual realities persons confront in daily life,
it is as powerful and disturbing, thought provoking a work as any
there is.

James Welch (1940-2002) i think was/is one of the best American
writers of the last thirty years.  (Fool's Crow, Killing Custer
(non-fiction), Winter in the Blood and several books of poetry).  A
Blackfeet-Gros Ventre he grew up on reservations along the Montana
border with Canada.  He was a student of Richard Hugo's (In a
statement on his work, he noted that he knew nothing about poetry at
the start,  and wrote down "Yates" as an author recommended in class)
James Welch is a world writer--not "only an Indian writer."   In 2000
he was made a Chevalier de les Artes et les Lettres by the French
Govt.  I read recently that Jim Loney, already a Penguin book, will be
reissued next summer as a Penguin classic.

Billy Pilgrim in _Slaughterhouse-Five_.  The book teaches well, too, at

I am teaching a war literature class. Many of my students have said that people who are in the military and who have been to Iraq, etc. are heroes because they are "defending our country," making our country greater," etc. I am thinking of the anti-hero as the person who goes against society's norms. I was part of the Viewnam generation. Our heroes in many cases were those who would not "fight for our country." I would consider them anti-heroes. I also see the flawed but person trying to do theright thing as an anti-hero.

  I think there are various definitions for the anti-hero, but the comments that my students have made make me go with the definition of the person who goes against society's norms for ethical reasons.

Dear Mary,

I just taught Vonnegut's *Slaughterhouse-Five* in a
freshman writing seminar. While there isn't exactly a
hero in the novel, Billy Pilgrim is a fine anti-hero,
which is, of course, in keeping with Vonnegut's
anti-war argument. Arguably, there are minor
characters, such as Bertram Copeland Rumfoord, a
Harvard historian, who--had he written the same
book--would have given us more traditional heroes.

My students loved this book. The wonderful thing about
starting the semester off with *Slaughterhouse-Five*
was that it was both easy enough for everyone to feel
like an expert on and complex enough to allow more
sophisticated students to explore challenging issues
such as narratorial indirection.

I paired this reading with long excerpts from
Frederick Taylor's recent revisionist history,
*Dresden*. We discussed the generic similarities and
differences between history and fiction, our resultant
expectations, and the various rhetorical and
structural techniques Taylor and Vonnegut use to
portray the firebombing of Dresden. Another
interesting point is that Taylor revises David
Irving's version of the firebombing, a version that
Vonnegut--though he was in Dresden as a prisoner of
war--relies on to confer historical accuracy on his
account.

Best,
Jessica Bozek

I am thinking of teaching a freshman compostion class
with a "hero and anti-hero" theme. Most of my students
are not great readers, so it can't be a philosophical
tome (although who knows? I may be surprised.) Does
anyone have any good ideas for a book about or on
"anti-hero"

  Thanks.

Clearly for some the creation of a poem is a form of mindfulness.  I find myself doing this all the time as I watch movies, plays, operas, etc. where I write.  I use the meditative technique of not-quite choiceless awareness to pick up things from my surroundings.  This has always seemed to me to be a form of meditation, although different from the form of vipassana practice I do in the morning which is based on bodily sensations.  Thanks for bringing this up.

When I first read Michael
McClure’s book Three Poems in 1995
and saw in the author’s preface the words “if poetry and science cannot change
one’s life they are meaningless,” something resonated so deeply it was to
change my life for the better, forever (xv). It added a great deal of momentum
to my own process of individuation and serves as the main part of the substrate
of the materials gathered here. What resonated deeply was that poetry ought to
have a transformative function or what was the point? continued at: http://www.globalvoicesradio.org/Organic-Poetry-Introductory-Essay-4.8.07.html

Subject: Role of the Poet in Society


I've just been studying some Levertov and came across these words:
"Contemplation - meditation - the words are taken from the religious
vocabulary, and surely this is no accident; for we should remember the
ritual, sacramental roots of art and realize that the act of creating a
work
of art is in its nature a celebration of life...and that the artists
himself
has a function not very different from that of the priest of shaman.
...It is a testimony of that 'participation mystique', that involvement
of
the individual in a life beyond himself, which is a basic element of
religion in the broadest and deepest sense. The poem communicates
something
more of life to the receiver than he would have without it, and the
poet is
the mediator or priest in this rite of communion, in which, as in
Christian
communion, he himself participates also as a receiver."
Her thoughts tie in to some that I have had over the past while. Is the
poet, or, more broadly, the creative artist, the shaman of contemporary
society? Is the process of creating a poem similar to that of a
vipassana,
i.e. mindfulness, meditation? What is the role of the creative artist
in
society now that 'art-for-arts-sake' is passé?

I think there are various definitions for the anti-hero, but the comments that my students have made make me go with the definition of the person who goes against society's norms for ethical reasons.

I would suggest Ian Hamiltion Finlay's extended garden, Little Sparta,  if a  physical, continuous space of spatial/concrete poems fit - as I think they should - into the category of a 'long poem.' I guess Little Sparta would have to be measured in acres or hexameters (or a fraction thereof), but, Google as I may, the garden's actual physical size does not emerge in my searches.
 Anybody know?  I don't know how anyone would translate those grounds into pages (other than as an art book), but, Finlay clearly figured some brilliant ways to translate his pages (or syntax),  into a complex, intellectually challenging and beautiful use of those grounds.

I heard Daniel Berrigan a couple of weeks; he spoke in relation to a
documentary made about him. If I bought into hero/anti-hero - I'd
certainly see him as a hero, heroic; an anti-hero has at least a faint
implication of the anti-heroic...

David,
  That sounds like a great possibility. I have heard of the novel and the writer. I suspect that it will be very readable to "my students who don't read" and will provoke a great deal of thought from them.
  Thank you.

  The Death of Jim Loney by James Welch

Welch writes in a style i call "harsh lyricism." The writing is very
spare, so that, in effect, nothing is spared. It is so incisive a
style it cuts into one, and when reading it for the first time during
heat wave i felt i was freezing, and walked about in a coat.

Jim Loney is at the vanishing point where the hero and anti-hero
dissolve into a tragedy collapsing the ancestral/ancient and present
day into--a half-breed Indian's confronting the abyss.

Jim Loney is a half-breed in the sense also of being--torn between the
heroic and the anti-heroic--and faced with these "choices": what is
it his "way out" of finding an impossible/possible balance?

The style is very accessible, simple and direct, very achingly
beautiful while also being very harsh and uncompromising. I think it
is (deceptively) "easier to read' for non-readers than any of the
books mentioned, and as far as examining the hero/anti-hero in terms
of American myths as actual realities persons confront in daily life,
it is as powerful and disturbing, thought provoking a work as any
there is.

James Welch (1940-2002) i think was/is one of the best American
writers of the last thirty years. (Fool's Crow, Killing Custer
(non-fiction), Winter in the Blood and several books of poetry). A

I think the mention of cent mille milliards of poems is worth discussing.

For example, since it is a combinatorial length, not an "as written" length,
it would be far easier to translate it than to translate the average 800
pages+ work.  Does "translatability" change the way one thinks about
length?  What about the portions of A and Martyrology which are scored, so
that "only" the lyrics require translation, unless, I suppose, one were
rearranging, or tranposing keys, or using a different scale?

It is a unitary variation, which makes it more a single concept.  Does this
make it more a single long work, rather than cent mille milliards poems.

I think, too, that something open-ended, or ongoing, or including
"everything" written in a certain period (open to the extent that what is
everything, and how can it be gathered) might be longer in some sense than
something that is "completed".

I have not read everyone's entries, but have folks mentioned Beverly Dahlen's on -going, A READING.

 I alway think of Lyn Hejinian's work as one extended poem/prose project with multiple branches that are given different titles.

 & I always think of that poem of Jack Spicer's about being on the shrink's couch where his imagination floats down the length of California  (including various moments) a wonderful long poem in a quite literal sense. Too lazy now to look up the name of that poem!

Although it is not the longest, the unjustly neglected Tahl by Jeremy
Ingalls weighs in at 621 pages. Let's start our discussion with that one
mIEKAL!

I also notice that Steve mentioned Jones' In Parenthesis; he also wrote The
Anathemata
as well as the unfinished Roman Quarry which if he had lived to complete it
would have been longer that both his previously mentioned works.

By the way, how long is Peter Ganick's Splintered??

Anecdotally, the newspapers around cities of Oakland and Richmond are
very particular about covering every single murder, as well as
publishing maps and calendars and retrospective pieces on the year's
violence. While some of this reporting is good, as far as journalism
goes, the maddening difference is that there is rarely any follow-up
of the kind we are almost sure to see in this Nebraska or recent
Colorado case, the kind that discovers motives and histories of
personal problems- causal explanations. Urban, minority on minority
violence, gets treated as either a given or as a completely
impenetrable phenomenon, despite the piles of analysis available from
academe. I take Herb's point that the psychological explananda after
a V-Tech or Columbine incident are often unhelpful, it seems telling
that in the one case some effort is made, however faulty, and in the
other no effort is made at all.

it pisses me off to no end.

encroach
into the garden, and the eye takes in the surrounding slopes and hills =

conversation -- yes. A long poem, and complex, engaging the active and
walking reader as participant in and of this ever-changing and to my eye

(obviously) verb.

I would suggest Ian Hamiltion Finlay's extended garden, Little Sparta,  =
if a
physical, continuous space of spatial/concrete poems fit - as I think =
they
should - into the category of a 'long poem.' I guess Little Sparta would
have to be measured in acres or hexameters (or a fraction thereof), but,
Google as I may, the garden's actual physical size does not emerge in my

 Anybody know?  I don't know how anyone would translate those grounds =

pages (other than as an art book), but, Finlay clearly figured some
brilliant ways to translate his pages (or syntax),  into a complex,
intellectually challenging and beautiful use of those grounds.

Anny,
Your mentioning Nietzsche gives me an opportunity to share small portion of book by Robert Kelly and Birgit
Kempker titled "Shame" which I highly recommend."...Nietzsche is ashamed of the world but not about
his own self....Nietzsche is ashamed of his mother and his father, his mother Mary and his father Jesus,
his opa Joachim and his oma Anna, Hannah, the grace of G-d. He is ashamed of God's grace, his father's
money, he is ashamed of the Greek language but not of his own mastery of it. He is ashamed of everything
but himself and his desires and his will to sing. Flamme bin ich, he says famously, I am a flame and all
I can do is burn, and I do give light while I burn, and you will bask in my light and warmth, and when I
am finished you'll find that I have burned up the whole world. Your world. Not mine. I am ashamed of my
world and turn my back on it."

The hero of the hero and anti-hero dichotomy is Nietzsche, if read with some
attention he is simple, it depends again on the students' will to approach
him.
Great choice the one of Mr. Ripley! I just watched the movie which is quite
exceptional, by Minghella, script co-written with Highsmith. Otherwise:
Cormac McCarthy: Suttree and The Road.

Alan,
I feel the anti-hero has become a stance--all too familiar. That's the thing: the anti-hero "talks"
but doesn't "do"--he is the "lifestyle artist"--he is the "radical poet" who actually is a follower.
S(he) is an image. "Fame" above accomplishment / ?the anti-hero has been appropriated into the
culture at large and rendered neutral. That's how I see it now. Dying of thirst, not the first I'd ask
for a glass of water from----

Thanks for opening this up, Dillon. The amount of killng among the young - mostly Black, Latino and Asian - of each other is heart breaking, Drugs, turf, vengeance - a relentless cycle. Those among us who have taught in the Juvenile  prison systems across the country can no doubt testify to the tragedy of seeing young lives put early to ruin - people who are still in effect children mostly fated to never have an 'outside' life, indeed fated to feed a prison complex that is perniciously given to keep expanding, a business that it is. Another, related and continuous version of  'middle passage.'  A sadness multiplied because, say, teaching creative writing in these circumstances can also be joyous.

 One could say the prison system is to the young what FEMA has been in response to Katrina.

 For more cheap thrills read Anthony Lewis' article in the current New York Review of Books on the current direction of the Supreme Court.

other no effort is made at all.

it pisses me off to no end.

of our favorites over the years has been BARTON FINK. (Coen Brothers)

Subject: Re: "Louis Pasteur is born!" (Creeley on biopics)/no writers

There have been a great many movies made "about" writers and their
  bios, myths, personae, just not very many good ones.
 =20
  (this is excluding for the moment documentaries of which there are
  many very good ones.)
 =20
  A good film was made of Stevie Smith's life, part of it--with Glenda
  Jackson giving an excellent performance.  The film of Tom and Viv-- Mr
  T S  Eliot and his first wife--i thought fairly good.
 =20
  Reds for example--Warren Beatty's  intended "sweeping" epic life of
  John Reed  (Ten Days that Shook the World, he also wrote poetry) had
  also Jack Nicholson playing Eugene O'Neil
  .
    Then there are the Hemingway semi-bios like Islands in the Stream
  with as i recall George C Scott.  Biopics like Last Time I Saw Paris
  based on Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald,  a bad old swashbuckler one on
  life of Villon, the Rimbaud-Verlaine one with Leo di Caprio, Barfly
  based on Bukowski, Capote which won lot of awards for performance, a
  couple bad ones i have seen on the life/lives of the Brontes, others
  from the  blurred pop culture images of the writings and life of Edgar
  Poe, basically the ghostly after effects of Classics comics versions
  of him, entertaining in a luridly filmed way,.
  I remember dimly an old french film on the life of Jules Verne that wa=
s fun.
 =20
  Ring Lardner, in Eight Men Out, played by John Sayles, the film's
  director, and very well, as an amazingly resemblance
 =20
  The really good films about writers tend to be of mythical or dream
  poets like Cocteau's ORPHEE which had such a huge influence on Jack
  Spicer, as well as Cocteau's much earlier classic, le Sang d'un poete.
   (Blood of a Poet)
 =20
 =20
  And let's not forget a great film (screenplay differing bit from the
  book, both by Graham Greene)--THE THIRD MAN--a great film featuring a
  writer of Westerns (Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins) in search of an
  old friend--(Orson Welles--also sought after via Cotten in Citizen
  Kane)--
 =20
  In Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven--a main character is a writer of the
  trashy tales of "legendary" outlaws and gunslingers, whom the brutal
  Gene Hackman takes under his wing --to chronicle a "real life"
  gunslinger at work--
 =20
  In Kurosawa's great IKIRU (To Live) there is the --again--writer of
  pulp fiction, a  kindhearted gaunt poete maudit type, who becomes the
  friend of the dying protagonist.
 =20
  In Godard's Pierrot le fou, Belmondo wants to be a writer, and starts =
writing--
 =20
  there are a great many versions made in several languages of Knut
  Hamsun's great autobiographical HUNGER--literally about a "starving
  writer"--
 =20
  An interesting aspect of (real and fictional) writers in film is that
  they are included in the action and developments of characters--as a
  device, a commentator, an investigator, an instigator, a prompter,  a
  spy--the writer becomes a link between the audience and the action on
  screen--provided extra details, connections between characters and
  sub-plots--
  riffing of the scenes with their own personal imaginings and speculati=
ons--
 =20
  The writer is perceived so to speak by/within many films as an
  observer within the observing and observed field of visions of
  characters and audiences both.  The writer is the "private eye"
  exploring for those "inquiring minds who want to know"--in many cases
  hired by someone in the film--and in a sense, by the audience also,
  which has paid for admission and now demands a good return on the
  investment.
 =20
  The greatest example of a writer as many of these aspects in film may
  be thought of as Shakespeare's RICHARD THE THIRD--since Richard
  basically speaks his "writing" of the action --ahead of time--to the
  audience--and then proceeds to act out the scenes--the writer becoming
  an actor who is simultaneously directing the scene unknown to the
  other characters who now make their entrances according to his script,
  right on cue, and "follow his direction to the letter" in the most
  literal ways.  All of which Richard can afterwards share as a good
  laugh with his reader/audience
 =20
  Since a lot of American writers had been involved with journalism, and
  had done from time to time pulp writing also--it was an easy move when
  many of these multi-genred, multi-professional writers worked in
  Hollywood to insert the character of a writer
  In many films noir, one finds a character, either a newspaper
  reporter, a writer-wanna-be or a screen play writer--often as the
  person who plays the part of the narrator, or a commentator on the
  action--
 =20
  Or the writer--because a professional practitioner of fictions,
  lies--may be the "suspect" as in the Humphrey Bogart film in which he
  plays a violence-prone screen writer.
 =20
  For example, In Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, the Bill Holden
  character is a screenplay writer--
 =20
  In the 1948 version of Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men with
  Broderick Crawford, a reporter turned speech writer and PR man is one
  of the main characters--hauled along to be the observer--
 =20
  Newspaper reporters were featured in many screwball comedies--two
  versions each of My Girl Friday and Ball of Fire for example--
  All the Presidents Men--investigative reporting--
 =20
  Naked Lunch features its author Bill Burroughs as his own
  character-(an actor playing Bill "playing"
  fictionally/autobiographically himself--)-within both his writings
  being made--and within the film being made of his writings--
 =20
  One could go on and on and on-getting lost---into the labyrinths of
  Borgesian libraries of decaying films in cannisters containing the
  "lives of writers," "the days and nights of the poets," the tragic and
  comic melodramas of authors real and imaginary, famous and forgotten .

All--thanks for your comments.
=20
This was my response to one member who corresponded privately.  The =
member, I should, note, was curious to know the context in which I =
quoted Pound in my paper:
=20
"The historical context you sketch is one that I was happy to be =
refamiliarized with; this is just the sort of thing I was looking for.  =
Based upon this refreshed sense, I think my use of Pound's dictum in my =
paper holds good. I want to argue how Dunn's poetry has certain values =
that we tend to associate with prose--I am in particular thinking of =
elegance of diction, narrative power, and complexity of thought.  These =
qualities seem to me to mark Dunn's better poems.  Dunn's poetry doesn't =
foreground, as much postmodern poetry does, the play of language, but =
wants essentially to use language as a means of exploring the meaning of =
experience, even if his poems tend to ultimately gesture toward the =
elusiveness or ephemerality of final meanings.  This isn't to say there =
isn't a musicality, a "poetry" to Dunn's use of language--there =
certainly is--but is to say that our experience of the typical Dunn poem =
seems to be informed by a kind of aesthetic experience we typically seek =
to find in prose (I, of course, am well aware of the counter-response; =
Dunn exemplifies, in fact, how many of us do indeed look to find just =
such values in poetry, hence the whole topic).  As a (slight) aside, it =
seems to me that one of the oddities of Pound is how he wants his poetry =
to have prosaic values--to enact, dramatize, spell through language =
cultural value and significance--but in practice writes a kind of poetry =
that at least I, for one, have difficulty aligning with prose as I =
understand it."
=20
So back to the group--I'm left wondering to what degree Pound's =
statement has relevance today.  The great diversity of poetic practices =
that govern the current state of poetry undoubtedly complicates the =
issue, as does the diversity of prose styles, for that matter. =20
=20
I'm also left wondering to what degree it's ever advisable, in Pound's =
day or our own, to import judgments concerning the nature of prose into =
questions concerning the nature of poetry.  Certainly both prose and =
poetry require taking great care with words.  But Pound also seems to be =
making a value judgment concerning the state of prose versus that of =
poetry.  It's certainly something of a truism to say that poetry by the =

If I remember correctly, T. S.Eliot states the same, or something close =

it, in one of his essays. He is attacking the vagueness of thought and

Does anyone know of

The Walking People  by Paula Underwood?

868 pages, a Native American Oral History

translated and written down in the 20th century?

It's length could be measured in time as well as pages.

Around page 200 something the poem speaks of the beginning of wearing clothes,

later on there are stories about building the mounds in the Ohio area.

I couldn't say enough about the pleasures of reading this epic, though I could easily say too much.

RIC

I'd love to see this list consider any one of these poems in depth.
Long poems in general have been ignored spurned neglected for far too
long.  As time moves forward it seems the attention span grows
shorter, even physically having the time to read 800 pages is an
improbability for most people.  Also I think the internet & hypertext
has had a profound effect on how larger bodies of information are
organized & accessed.  I've been working for a number of years trying
to come up with an online portal for my long poem but to date I
haven't come up with an interface that would allow the reader to
navigate intuitively thru the work.  Maybe when I can add a bit of AI
to to the interface that would query a person's tastes and interests
(or read from their facebook profile :) & then, knowing a person's
interests, would affect what is presented on the screen.

About a third of my long poem SAMSARA CONGERIES is online here in a
static format

http://xexoxial.org/samsara_congeries/?q=book

& hopefully I'll have a final typescript of the poem (which I started
in 1978) finished in the next month.  It, by the way, runs somewhere
over 800 pages but I'd like design it in such a way that it could be
around 500 pages.  Finding a publisher for it will be harder than
writing it.

What I really wonder, Ric,  is why the question in the first place?
What does knowing the number of pages of a long poem really tell us
about the long poem itself.  Perhaps yr plotting a new entry in the
Guiness World Book of Records?

Now how long is your long poem?

I'll lay odds the longest long poem of the 20th century hasn't been found yet, but is lurking in someone's attic: composed by a complete outsider, it would be the poetry counterpart of Henry Darger's "In the Realms of the Unreal."

The longest poem I know of is Lee Groban's CURE FOR INSOMNIA.  It has not
been published, though, and is probably unpublishable.  Lee's website says
that it is over 5,000 pages long and still unfinished.  20 years ago someone
made a movie of him reading the poem (cut together with assorted video
footage).  The movie is 87 hours long.

More than wanting to see an in-depth discussion of a particular poem, I'd b=

it seems to me that there are different types of long poems--broadly, there=
 are catch-alls, where the poem basically seems to contain everything that =
came into the poet's mind during the period of its composition, as with the=
 Cantos, while others have some sort of more objective unity of topic, as w=

HOW NOT TO REQUIRE RESURRECTION

Children like to play at death =96
they hold their breath,
and cross their arms and shut their eyes
until they forget to be dead; then rise
from their nest of pillows and play instead
at being lost or married,
as if their state was mutable, as if, like water
they could flow or freeze or climb without a ladder
into the heavens then drop back down =96
they are the first resurrectionists, they alone
understand the trick is not to try,
that once you believe in death, you will surely die.

New from United Artists Books

THE INFLUENCE OF PAINTINGS HUNG IN BEDROOMS

by Phyllis Wat

75 pages    ISBN 0-935992-36-7    $14.00

A new book of poems by the author of The Fish Soup Bowl Expedition
(2000) and the editor and publisher of Strawgate Books. Wat is a
founding coeditor of 6x Magazine and the recipient of two grants from
the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. She was contributing editor to
The World, the literary magazine of The Poetry Project in New York,
from 1992-93, and is presently coeditor of a new on-line magazine Press
1. She lives in Philadelphia and New York.

"Like any communicating vessel, Phyllis Wat condenses all she learns
into poems. Like a zen master more interested in play than lessons,
Wat's poems are bending reeds: in seeking knowledge, she's unlearning
at the same time and finding forms for what resonates. Witty and filled
with delightful aphorisms and maxims, like the best satire, it's each
poem's crazy wisdom that ultimately comes through. Use this book as
guide for getting lost--right into the poem."
Kristin Prevallet

"Precise and prescient, Phyllis Wat etches the exigencies of everyday
in luminous and deep-seeing language. She enfolds the mysterious within
simplicity, and the structures of her poems are such that once you
finish, so you begin again. 'Strange lands are for understanding," and
Wat comprehends, compels, gestures for us to join her in her travels
both inside and outside. This is a treasure of a journey of a book."

Amy Trussell's new ebook/book Meteorite Dealers is available free for
download or for purchase in print through Moria Books:
http://www.moriapoetry.com/ebooks.html.

Praise for the book:

Reading Amy Trussell's poetry is great for the soul. Her work is steeped in
rich imagery, with colorful, soulful elements.  Her poems have movement. .
.they're magical, and one can almost see them dancing off the page!
=97Marjorie Mann, actor and screenwriter


Reading The Meteorite Dealers, I am reminded of the sorcerer-bards in the
Kalevala, singing objects, plants, everyday items into a dynamic existence.

Amy sings a mean (but compassionate!) deep-sea ink that somehow gives us a
glimpse of deep-space. . .perhaps the first hurtlings and hissings of what
would later become that pagan, celestial stone now statically housed in
Mecca.

Though Amy certainly respects our intelligence, she rips us straight to the
heart, to where we may remember what we might not have fully experienced.

Amy Trussell is truly the meteorite dealer, midwife, muezzin and juggler of
octagons and essences.  In this work, as in all her other works, language
multiplies and issues forth another dynamic meaning for: singularity.
Finally, the Ka'aba meteorite performs zikr. . . .

Hey everyone -

I'm teaching Creative Writing at Saint Louis University again next spring,
and again I'm planning to use current poetry journals as textbooks. Last
time I was blessed to receive complimentary copies from Chicago Review,
Fourteen Hills, Court Green, Parakeet, and a few others. I need only 15
copies per journal. It would really help make my class vital to have them.

If you think you'd like to pitch in, email me.

In September, John Palatella became literary editor of The Nation, so you
can probably expect to see more poetically progressive stuff therein.  Just
check out their recent poetry. (You need to be a subscriber to see it
online, however.)

House Press is thrilled to make available Cedar Sigo's Expensive
Magic. With precision and elegance, these poems carry the reader
through Astoria, the slums of Paris, through London, Abyssinia, and
Tangiers. As poetry at times both terse and lush, the poems create a
strange world threatening to spill into violence, but holding fast to
those people the poet loves. Cedar is an exceptional talent, and we're
happy to have him in our company.

This is the first book in the House Press Bay Area poetry series. A
reading will be held in January in San Francisco to celebrate the
book. For more information about the series, please write to Michael
Slosek at mslosek at fulbrightweb dot org.

copies can be purchased for $6 at http://housepress.blogspot.com

HousePress is an independent, poetry-centered arts community founded
in Buffalo, NY in 2002. Authors / publishers live in Buffalo, Chicago,
New York, Albany, Charlottesville, and San Francisco.

Yes, but as so often seems the case it is far more likely that they will review
wonderful poetry than that they will publish it --

Yale has recently made some of their courses available on the
web; they have the lectures recorded as transcripts, audio or
full-length video, and there are accompanying handouts. One of
the seven courses available is a course on Modern American
Poetry. Taught by Langdon Hammer, the courses to appear to focus
on individuals (beginning with Frost and ending with Bishop). I
just learned about this moments ago, reading the Chronicle of
Higher Ed at work, so I haven't had a chance to watch any of
these movies--a streaming video would kill this ancient computer
and fry our network--but I was curious to hear some responses.
For one, I think that's a great name: Langdon Hammer.
I have long been a fan of MIT's Open Courseware (ocw.mit.edu). I
have daydreamed about becoming a self-taught physicist,
economist, and botanist. I've balked at buying the most
up-to-date textbooks, which seem to be the most key missing
element, but the OCW has been useful, for example, when I was
getting some exposure to electronic literature. The
comprehensiveness of OCW is good too if you just want to browse
through course syllabi. On first impression, which is all I have
at the moment, Open Yale (a bad name, in my opinion) seems to
serve a different function than OCW or other comparable websites.
Some of the other websites that come to mind are PENNsound, the
EPC, UBU, and meaningoflife.tv. Perhaps the only valid comparison
is between Open Yale and MIT's OCW (or any other comparable
website I'm not aware of) because these are both created by
universities to reflect university itself, while these other
websites are subject-based and comprised of primary material
edited and moderated by dedicated individuals.
It may be interesting to talk about some of the individual
lectures (or maybe not at all), but I'm wondering what people
thought about these kinds of website in general. Open Yale
appears to be primarily about marketing the Yale classroom
experience: fetishizing the teaching and classroom experience.
They should have included video of students taking midterms, a
4'33" of the classroom. OCW is interesting because I think it
could in some ways serve as a university-based replacement to
Blackboard or similar programs. I assume most people will be
biased towards the same websites as I am, but I am curious to
hear responses.

Well, I don't really go to The Nation to read poetry. Grateful that they
would even review a book such as this.

Hiya,


my name is cris cheek and i am an English poet currently living and working
in south-west Ohio with Keith Tuma, Cathy Wagner and Bill Howe. A lot of you
will know something of me i think. I've got a big book forthcoming from The
Gig in 2008 and I'm looking to do some occurrences. to get around and about
and meet folks Stateside more generally. The most recent publication
available right now is "The Church, the School, the Beer" (Critical
Documents, 2007) in a wonderful pocketbook version from jUStin katKO. I'm
looking to do read and performances in just about any situation going. A lot
of my work involves text-image <------> text-sound articulation and I will
travel tech sufficient altho (despite the fact that i can belt it out when
required . . . . and sometimes when completely uncalled for too) a decent PA
is helpful for larger spaces. I can give talks and presentations both on my
own poetic writing practice as well as on work by peers and on early
twenty-first century British Poetry more broadly.


What i do tends to be lively and varied and energizing and is often
site-responsive. I'm particularly happy to be in Galleries spaces as i like
to work with sound and image projection.


I'm going to respond to any offers, but i'm also going to be trying to group
things a little so that i'm zig-zagging the entire country on a nightly
basis as Jimi Hendrix was forced into ;). I am on leave until next August,
so hoping to get out and about and meet some of you before then,



looking forwards



love and love



cris

Not a bad review. He sure was apologetic in tone...I mean as in apologia,
not like "sorry"....

That one Smith quote he gives seems to really have legs...I've seen that
like eight different places in the last year...it's a funny line...and so
true....

Rod Smith has done so much for poetry...sort of DC's poetry  boddhisatva for
decades...AERIAL was (and is) such an important  magazine...when
futureavantpoets look back on the eighties and nineties it  will probably be AERIAL, O.blek
and only a handful of other mags they will  want....great to see his own very
strong work getting attention  now...

When we approach Nietzsche's philosophy we must be prepared to be
independent thinkers; in fact, the greatest virtue of his works is perhaps
the subtlety with which they impose the obligation upon one of thinking
alone, of scoring off one's own bat, and of shifting intellectually for
oneself.

ANTHONY M. LUDOVICI. London, February 1909. Project Gutenberg Etext of Thus
Spake Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche

Bobbi,

I think that Nietzsche is one of our greatest thinkers. Finally revalued by
Derrida hopefully new readings will be carried out.
I am excerpting from an assignment I recently wrote. If I agree with you, i=
t
was not easy for Nietzsche to live up to his thought.


Nietzsche was born in 1844 in a small village in Prussian Saxony. "He was
the son and grandson (on both sides of the family) of Lutheran ministers."
[1] <http://mail.google.com/mail/#_ftn1> He was influenced by Arthur
Schopenhauer's anti-academic, ascetic, misogynist philosophy (1788-1860) an=
d
by the Wagner couple, to reject them violently later in *Human too
human*together with the Christian religion (in Wagner's case, repelled
by his
increasing anti-Semitism[2] <http://mail.google.com/mail/#_ftn2>).

I sometimes see my hand with a certain diffidence because it seems to me to
have in "my hand" humanity's destiny

Friedrich Nietzsche, Letter to Gast, October 30, 1888; when he first
announced *Ecce Homo*.

Time hasn't arrived for me yet, there are men who were born posthumous.

Friedrich Nietzsche, *Ecce Homo*.

In the meantime I start becoming famous in an unprecedented way. I believe
that never has a mortal being received letters as the ones I am receiving,
and only by *refined* intelligences.

Friedrich Nietzsche, Letter to Meta von Salis, December 29,
1888.[3]<http://mail.google.com/mail/#_ftn3>

Lou Andreas-Salom=E9 wrote in the spring 1882:

After I had gone back to Stibbe for the fall, we met again in October and
for three weeks with Nietzsche in Leipzig. Neither of us thought that it
would be the last time. Anyhow it was not as in the beginning, even if our
wish of a common future with the three of us was still standing. [=85] Not
only: Paul R=E9e kept hidden from me how such malicious tongues had irritat=
ed
*his* family against me, up to hate, even if in this case his mother's
tendency to a pathological jealousy played a great part, she wanted to keep
her son all and only for herself.[4] <http://mail.google.com/mail/#_ftn4>

Paul Lanzky wrote in 1886:

It was from 1882 that he started with the most dangerous substance, a
palliative that brings to oblivion, and only with brief intervals, chloral:
he ingested it to be able to overcome, besides his moral, physical
sufferance.[5] <http://mail.google.com/mail/#_ftn5>

It becomes evident at this point that Nietzsche was a victim of his times,
his family, the overall oppressive mentality, and later by the German
National Socialism translated into the SS and the extermination of the Jews=
.
Up to the point that he is still misunderstood by some uneducated feminists
and extremist tough fringes that ignorantly at best deal with his words.

Thanks for this one.  For some reason I've never encountered Lee
Groban before.  He sounds like quite the character. Plus he in fact
does hold the record for the longest poem.

Here's an excerpt from of the poem on his website:

meIEKAL,

 The beauty of a long piece is that it is always revealing new ways of
interpreting itself over time to the reader. To immerse oneself in the
intricacies, depth and complexity of a long work is one of the
distinctions poetry offers. That is what draws me to the form of the
long poem and all its diverse manifestations, from structured pieces
like Merrill's Changing light to the more free-flowing works of Asberry
and Ammonns,Olson, etc .
My interest in the long poem is one of aesthetics, continuity and of
course its history and evolution. The way I approach reading a long poem
is not all at once, but it is rather a systematic study over time of its
form, content and overall impression. The concentrated aspects of
poetry's nature is what I believe brings about the myriad ways to
approach, interpret and dissect its essence.


I find your Congeries an intriguing work. The heterogeneity one
experiences when first approaching it is to me
a jumping off point into unknown semantic wilderness. This is just the
point I was trying to make in my above statement. This work indeed
promises the complexities and rewards which makes the whole nature of
poetry a worthwhile art form in which to immerse oneself. You've
succeeded in showing this with the examples you present on your site,
albeit static or not. I look forward to someday seeing & obtaining a
complete copy. Do you find 'conventional' (read paper copy) publishers
positive and accepting of your work? Historically, works of this nature
has a notoriously checkered past, and it's only the passage of time
which proves to be the measure with which they are weighed and find
favor. Also, has someone done an interview with you regarding the work,
or are there any essays floating around wherein I can glean some info
into it's method of construction,extent etc? I think a work of this
diversity and complexity deserves to be studied and expounded in depth.


As far as my own composing of a long poem, well I'm not shooting for any
record books and I don't shout it from rooftops. I'm rather low-key
about soliciting my work these days. When all's said and done (and
written) it should shake out to be 800 plus pages, or thereabouts. I
just recently finished a 350 page installment of it which I will be
sending out for potential publication next month. If it gets selected
that'll be great, but I understand publishers apprehension these days
about taking on new, experimentalish work. To me it's just the
satisfaction of actually completing something. Whether it's historically
accepted and
actually read by others or not is a moot point. I guess we all have an
impression of how someone else should interpret our work, how we hope
they appreciate all the nuances and poignancies that went into its
composition. But then again that would be in a perfect world, and we
know that that's not the case. But I'm positive about it (the world that
is) just the same!!!

Be Well,
Ric

I laughed all the way through Ecce Homo, the first book of Nietzsche's that
I read, in the way one laughs at tragedy. It is an absurd and sad book.
Though I think almost all of Nietzsche is pretty funny, or at least, most
misunderstood when its humour is mislaid. My favourite is The Gay Science.
Where indeed he says:

In the great majority, the intellect is a clumsy, gloomy, creaking machine
that is difficult to start: they call it "taking the matter seriously" when
they want to work with this machine and think well - oh how burdensome they
must find good thinking! The lovely human beast always seems to lose its
good spirits when it thinks well; it becomes "serious"! And "where laughter
and gaiety are found, thinking does not amount to anything": - that is the
prejudice of this serious beast against all "gay science." - Well then, let
us prove that this is a prejudice!

Perhaps a way of teaching media

(I've been filling in for a couple of film courses at Brown University,
and this has led me to think through distributed knowledge in an 'open'
classroom, and how that plays out. The courses were, I think, extremely
successful. I've been partly inspired by two artist/teachers from the
1970s-80s: David Askevold at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design,
and Lutz Presser at the Tasmanian School of Art. Neither of them taught in
any conventional sense; both had a sense of student professionalism and
'being' that created outstanding works and environment. So below is just
some thinking about all of this; it's hardly original. it seems to work
well for me and my students, most of the time. There are also times I'm a
miserable, neurotic failure, but that's another issue, and not necess-
arily related.)

1 In terms of authority - everyone in the class, including the teacher, on
equal footing. I think authority comes from knowledge, not titles, formal-
ity, etc. This is hard to do within an institution where power is the
fundamental backdrop of the classroom, but I've done it as much as poss-
ible.

2 Distributed knowledge among students and faculty. In many areas, partic-
ularly those dealing with digital and popular culture, students are often
more knowledgeable than faculty. This is especially true with software -
students are apt to have used and hacked programs I haven't. Knowledge is
distributed and students and faculty work together, empower each other.
The classroom becomes a holarchic space of production, exploration, and
critique. I have to recognize that what I know, in many areas, is already
outdated.

3 No assignments except for technical in the beginning which may or may
not be completed. Students find their own paths through the class, subject
matter, and production. Students who are confused or aren't motivated
should be helped along, of course; the more collaborative the class is,
the more these students might be carried forward within a general atmos-
phere of communality. This area might be the most difficult - how to work
with unmotivated or reticent students - but I've found there are almost
always workarounds; at times, students might even ask for assignments or
help with content and/or media.

4 Learning equally from students as students from you. This goes along
with distributed knowledge; there's also distributed learning. If I'm not
learning, I'm not teaching well; if the class seems closed in this
respect, I'm doing something wrong.

5 Students/faculty = equal participants. Again, this plays out against the
backdrop of fundamental power, but that power should be deconstructed as
much as possible. Along with this - try to interest as many other faculty
as possible in the course (I've not been so successful here), and encour-
age students to bring outsiders in as well. Obviously there are limits on
this, but in general it works well.

6 Students treated as artists/writers/filmmakers to to the fullest extent
possible. The most successful classes I've seen are those in which stu-
dents are considered as producers in their own right. If I begin with the
idea that what a student is doing isn't 'student work,' more often than
not, I've found that students rise to the occasion.

7 "Professional" advice. Discussing art-making after university - how to
present, distribute, survive, both online and offline. Encouraging stu-
dents to submit work to suitable venues, organize screenings or exhibi-
tions, etc. I've also encouraged students to do their own media/art
history as much as possible; what's current is what is/will become the
student's environment, once she leaves university. I've tended to share my
own work/experiences in class to a limited extent, trying to keep students
from stylistic influence.

8 Students are free to work on whatever, including sliding into other
genres, media. Since the work is student-determined, ostensible class
content might not be the most suitable for a particular project. Instead
of dropping the project, perhaps change it, or change media.

(I feel I'm not presenting this stuff as well as I should be; others have
done a far better job of it. The main points are both a kind of withdrawal
on the part of the teacher, and an emphasis on distributed learning and
production on the part of the class as a whole. This doesn't work for
everyone in all situations - but when it does, the results are amazing in
so many ways.)

Thanks, David. I agree that the Poems from Guantanamo are more significant
than many will allow.

And so much of the art of that book is in the sort of remarks you make in
your blog.

What you write about the book and what other poets and artists make of that
book and the circumstances out of which it arose is sure to multiply into an
exegesis of the current state.

I will try to do a dbCinema series on "Poems from Guantanamo"

Anthony,
The words I sent were not my own but a quote I sent from Robert Kelly and Birgit Kempker's
book "Shame"--it is a book in which they discuss the issue of "Shame" and only shame--it's an
interesting book in that it holds to this theme/it examines this issue (shame) in exhaustive detail
due to the very personal/ interpersonal way in which it is written, written both in German and English.
It is not a scholarly text but an interpersonal discussion of rare honesty.
I was not attempting to discuss Nietzsche's philosophy but rather to respond to Mary's request for ideas
on the anti-hero (Anny called Nietzsche hero and anti-hero both)(your links did not work but sent me to
google sign in page so I'm sorry I was unable to read them)
I felt, in terms of the idea of "anti-hero" which becomes increasingly vague as I think about it, that
this passage (by Kelly and Kempker) illustrates an aspect of the anti-hero. I agree with you that
most anti-heros find it hard to live up to their thoughts but, as Alan pointed out, heros are known
for their actions.


Here is another quote from this book: "I am ashamed of myself because language never ends"--this is
the shame I feel whenever I post on lists (or even (maybe especially) backchannels at this point).
(something I have come to realize--impulse I feel and then regret acting upon--in communicating via
internet--but that's another topic--having nothing to do with your response in the least--I appreciate
your response--but more re: internet: the "illusion" of communication vs. the misunderstandings which
follow due to limitations of email communications coupled with fact that I realize I imagine some
"invisible listener" as I do when I write poetry--but as I say in response to who I write for I always
use this complete sentence: "I write to an invisible listener who may or may not exist"--for me, the
internet makes me feel ever more certain that there is no invisible listener--I feel internet
communications require a different set of rules, rules I have yet to understand. And so, I would like
to respond to Mary's question re: the anti-hero and, in spite of the fact that I know this will jive
badly with that terrible cover of "person of the year" or whatever, I feel I'd like to suggest to
Mary that the internet is the anti-hero. It puts off the existential crisis (thank you A. but I do
not hold you responsible) that lurks beneath and erupts suddenly after veneer of internet/ illusion
of connection and communication when truly it is a blank screen and what we imagine. I find it more
painful than 3-d life. So I'd say the internet is the anti-hero (but that's just for this early a.m.
with little sleep cause I'm just a stupid human being...most obviously)

Thank you,
Bobbi

Bobbi,

I think that Nietzsche is one of our greatest thinkers. Finally revalued by
Derrida hopefully new readings will be carried out.
I am excerpting from an assignment I recently wrote. If I agree with you, i=
t
was not easy for Nietzsche to live up to his thought.


Nietzsche was born in 1844 in a small village in Prussian Saxony. "He was
the son and grandson (on both sides of the family) of Lutheran ministers."
[1] <http://mail.google.com/mail/#_ftn1> He was influenced by Arthur
Schopenhauer's anti-academic, ascetic, misogynist philosophy (1788-1860) an=
d
by the Wagner couple, to reject them violently later in *Human too
human*together with the Christian religion (in Wagner's case, repelled
by his
increasing anti-Semitism[2] <http://mail.google.com/mail/#_ftn2>).

I sometimes see my hand with a certain diffidence because it seems to me to
have in "my hand" humanity's destiny

Friedrich Nietzsche, Letter to Gast, October 30, 1888; when he first
announced *Ecce Homo*.

Time hasn't arrived for me yet, there are men who were born posthumous.

Friedrich Nietzsche, *Ecce Homo*.

In the meantime I start becoming famous in an unprecedented way. I believe
that never has a mortal being received letters as the ones I am receiving,
and only by *refined* intelligences.

Friedrich Nietzsche, Letter to Meta von Salis, December 29,
1888.[3]<http://mail.google.com/mail/#_ftn3>

Lou Andreas-Salom=E9 wrote in the spring 1882:

After I had gone back to Stibbe for the fall, we met again in October and
for three weeks with Nietzsche in Leipzig. Neither of us thought that it
would be the last time. Anyhow it was not as in the beginning, even if our
wish of a common future with the three of us was still standing. [=85] Not
only: Paul R=E9e kept hidden from me how such malicious tongues had irritat=
ed
*his* family against me, up to hate, even if in this case his mother's
tendency to a pathological jealousy played a great part, she wanted to keep
her son all and only for herself.[4] <http://mail.google.com/mail/#_ftn4>

Paul Lanzky wrote in 1886:

It was from 1882 that he started with the most dangerous substance, a
palliative that brings to oblivion, and only with brief intervals, chloral:
he ingested it to be able to overcome, besides his moral, physical
sufferance.[5] <http://mail.google.com/mail/#_ftn5>

It becomes evident at this point that Nietzsche was a victim of his times,
his family, the overall oppressive mentality, and later by the German
National Socialism translated into the SS and the extermination of the Jews=
.
Up to the point that he is still misunderstood by some uneducated feminists
and extremist tough fringes that ignorantly at best deal with his words.

hi, Alan

thanks for submitting these ideas for a (dare i) democratic (versus bureaucratic dictator) classroom. i'm reading this with much interest, & thinking also of _Beat Not the Poor Desk_.

in regards to your number 6, a colleague where i teach does just that: bring in other faculty members to teach in areas where your knowledge may be lacking. he's teaching a World Poetry course, & has various faculty from various departments who are primary speakers of whichever language come in and read the work in its original language, then a translation & talk about translation, as well as their first introduction of said poet. (the faculty choose their own poets, even if its not in the class anthology). the students & the professor are then taught some key words/phrases so they can try their own hand at translation. it's been quite fun to hear about.

i try to bring in non-faculty, non-academic folks to the classroom, which is often difficult because of money issues, but when money is not an obstacle, i find it helpful to bring it artists who have made a way without academia.

M

Hmm, I will have to reread your email again. I do know that the internet does give me a false security. I teach an online class, and I surprise myself with my rants, but I don't think that is what you are telling me. That is why I will need to reread this (over and over) again.

  Thanks.

Jen- Thanks! It's really helpful and fun for the students. It's also
edifying for me, because it opens my eyes to a lot of stuff I didn't know
about. Last time around, I hadn't seen Fourteen Hills.  It turned out to be
a very spiffy journal. Also I had the students imitate a poem of their
choice. The results were just terrific. One of them won the prize for best
poem by an undergrad at SLU that year!!

Aaron, I don't have a journal to send, but what a great idea!

this makes me smile. Anthony Ludovici is the author of the quotation I chose

defuge6

(text without image)

The stem of the 6 leans forward, ready to topple.
The stem of the 6 is retained by the entire and complete
calculus of capital.
The calculus of capital is thick, exhausted, is always
exhausted, is always singular, singularity, always
the point and paste of the thing.
The calculus is in opposition to glue holding disparate
parts together _as such._
The calculus of capital knows only the unary divide.
And the unary addition and the unary increment
and substitution. And the unary substitution.
In my weary world the head bobs uselessly.
It looks in the thick of things for clock and radio.
It pulls the sheets up and pulls the sheets down.
It wraps and unwraps the cadaver of the body.
Beware the thud of 6 and thud of capital.
What is ready to topple sooner or later topples,
sooner or later revives into disparate parts.
(What is ready to topple has the consistency of glue.)

--- RECENT FEATURES ---

All Avant-Garde All The Time - UbuWeb Podcast #2:
Produced by The Poetry Foundation, UbuWeb is pleased to announce the second in its
podcast series, focusing on Ubu's hidden treasures. As the site has grown so large, these
occasional audio guides might shed some light on things you may have overlooked,
forgotten about or simply never knew about. This podcast explores the mass of recordings
by Giorno Poetry Systems (aka The Dial-A-Poem Poets), a series of double LPs put out back
in the 70s featuring artists such as Patti Smith, Laurie Anderson, Philip Glass, Meredith
Monk, John Cage, Richard Hell, Frank O'Hara and hundreds of others. [listen] UbuWeb's
first podcast, a general introduction to the site and to sound poetry, can be found here.
You can subscribe to our podcast here. The next one, focusing on the audio archives of
Aspen Magazine, will be ready in mid-January.
http://poetryfoundation.org/audio/John%20Giorno%20Poetry%20Systems.mp3


Komar & Melamid "The People's Choice Music" (1997) With the collaboration of composer
Dave Soldier, Komar & Melamid's Most Wanted Painting project was extended into the realm
of music. A poll, written by Dave Soldier, was conducted on The Dia Foundation's web site
in Spring 1996. Approximately 500 visitors took the survey. Solder used the survey
results to write music and lyrics for the Most Wanted and Most Unwanted songs.
http://www.ubu.com/sound/komar.html


Four Films by Gordon Matta-Clark: Includes Tree Dance (1971), Fresh Kill (1972), Day's
End (1975) and Office Baroque (1977). Gordon Matta-Clark's (1943-1978) artistic project
was a radical investigation of architecture, deconstruction, space, and urban
environments. Dating from 1971 to 1977, his most prolific and vital period, his film and
video works include documents of major pieces in New York, Paris and Antwerp, and are
focused on three areas: performances and recycling pieces; space and texture works; and
his building cuts.
http://www.ubu.com/film/gmc.html


Audio Selections from The Sackner Archive: Hundreds of MP3s ripped from rare sound poetry
LPs, tapes & 45 RPM vinyl. The Ruth & Mqrvin Sackner Archive of Visual & Concrete Poetry
in Miami Beach is the world's largest collection of text-based art. Of the audio files
here, curator Matthew Abess states: "The work presented here comprises a portion of the
Sackner's tremendous compendium of sonic works. The range of geographic origins runs the
circumference of the globe. The time span is nearly a century. It witnesses histories: of
poetry, literature, music, visual art, technology, politics, religion, theoretical
contentions and practical abstention." Artists include John Cage, Merzbow, Anton Bruhin,
Laurie Anderson, Bob Cobbing, Lily Greenham, Velemir Chlebnikov, Aleksej Krucenych and
Jean Jacques Lebel among dozens of others. UbuWeb is also pleased to feature a
full-length documentary about the Sackner Archive, Concrete! directed by Sara Sackner.
http://www.ubu.com/sound/sackner.html


Five Films by Jonas Mekas Mekas, born 1922, is considered by many to be the godfather of
American avant-garde cinema. Presented here are Happy Birthday to John (1972), a film
record of John Lennon's 32nd birthday party; Zefiro Torna or Scenes from the Life of
George Maciunas (1992), a video diary of Fluxus founder George Maciunas; and Scenes from
Allen's Last Three Days on Earth as a Spirit (1997), a video diary of Ginsberg in the
days immediately before and after his death. Also included is a short, Hare Krishna
(1966), with a soundtrack by Ginsberg.
http://www.ubu.com/film/mekas.html


Make Perhaps This Out Sense Of Can You: Bob Cobbing (1920-2002) A celebration
highlighting the works of Cobbing on UbuWeb: films, sounds, writings, interviews and
critical writing about him [PDF]. As curator Matthew Abess writes, "Cobbing was an
assiduous innovator in the sphere of language. Alternately a landscape gardener, farmer,
steward's clerk at a hospital, and teacher of Esperanto, Cobbing fluidly traversed
dissimilar vocations with the same dexterity apparent in his boundary-dissolving
performances with and of the plasticity of the word. When asked about the development of
his intermedia praxis, Cobbing remarked, 'I commenced as a painter; later wrote poetry;
studied music; began to realize all three were one activity (together with dancing, which
is, perhaps, the key to them all)." This UbuWeb resource is presented in conjunction with
the exhibition of the same name at the University of Pennsylvania's Van Pelt Library, The
Ruth & Marvin Sackner Archive of Visual and Concrete Poetry and the Kelly Writers House
at UPenn, where Suddenly Everyone Began Reading Aloud, a tribute to Cobbing took place
October 11th featuring the poets Charles Bernstein, chris cheek and Maggie O'Sullivan.

Salvador Dali - Impressions de la Haute Mongolie - Hommage á Raymond Roussel (1974-1975)
Salvador Dalí's romance with film and the visual arts is a relatively well-known chapter
in the life of the original and controversial Spanish (Catalan) artist (1904-1989).
However, his explorations of video art with the production of the "documentary"
Impressions de la haute Mongolie. Hommage a Raymond Roussel (1974-75) remain an episode
of his long and successful creative career only acknowledged by the specialist. The
"videografía", narrates the exploration of Dalí to the remote land of Mongolia in search
of the Great White Mushroom. Salvador Dalí, a consummate expert in media manipulation,
invites the spectator to become his accomplice and partner in what it seems a
drug-induced "trip" to a faraway and distant land where wonderful treasures are hidden.
By means of advanced technology in film and the visual arts of the time (video,
electronics, macro photography), Dalí strives to reveal optically the metamorphoses of
matter with the purpose of revealing a new artistic reality.

Hi, friends,

Hooke Press is pleased to announce the publication of:

INTERVIEW WITH ROBERT CREELEY

http://www.hookepress.com/creeley.html

This chapbook is the typescript of a taped interview I did with Creeley back in 1998.  Penelope Creeley, Bob's wife when he died in 2005, says that he talks about a number of things she's never heard him go into elsewhere.  We've only made 300, lovingly silkscreening the covers and lovingly paying a copyshop to
staple the spines.  It'll be out of print when those are gone.

We're going to have it at a small discount of $8 plus $4 shipping for a little while via the online ordering procedure you're probably all too familiar with.

Mary,
Let me be more specific.
This realization was inspired from your post and a backchannel I received which helped me realize something
and today I realize it further: the internet is the anti-hero. I will?make that as statement now.
Why?
I am new to internet communication esp. on lists. For me it represented fact that I tend to wake very early
so before my day begins I make some coffee and then I go to lists--at first thinking "how wonderful to connect
with others all over the world"--(a hero, isn't it? the sense that the internet is a hero--allowing one to communicate ideas so easily with so many people)--but now I learn today from a friend that something vile has been said about me on another list (something so untrue it is absurd but how do i argue with it? it only extends the pain but i take this accusation very seriously--does this mean i shall be trapped in the web of the internet forever, trying to explain myself to people i'll never meet/ have no idea about?...well, no chance of being met on the internet as who we really are is there? why am i being accused of something so distant from anything i think or feel? it must be due to my?ignorance of?political orientation of list--but mostly due to my naivete and blindness to fact that when I type a message, I have no idea who will receive it--though the illusion was there for a while that my actions were meaningful in sense of?messages being received as I intended them a
nd so I believed it. But there is a someone on the other end who has formed a view of each and all of us though we have no idea what that view is. We just see a blank screen and keep typing...
The idea of "anti-hero"?has traditionally been?represented via the form of a person--and I think also of a lecture by Suzi Gablick when she said something to the effect that the romanticism of the individual artist is over--that sound?is what unifies--therefore language etc. which is just another small idea to support my sense that individual anti-heros no longer really exist. this idea of anti-hero seems to be to have?been appropriated as a cultural norm in many circles (ie; art, poetry etc. but also very much by many in their teens and 20s--there are clothing lines that seem to cater to the "anti-hero look"--so i see it as veneer--it looks like angst (i refer now to existentiaism also the "image" of "rebel") but it is only a "look" the actual experience of it is avoided via technology now, i believe. i mean, people on their cell phones talking to someone else while they're?eating lunch?with a real live person / checking text msgs. rather than speaking--and also internet com
munication vs. phone calls or actual visits etc. The illusion of "who" you are speaking to is kept intact--when meeting an actual person there is no illusion--there is just another human facing you: you know what you can and can't say--so many signals like body language, voice, speech, eye contact or lack of etc.
The anti-hero was very important. Someone helped me see this with the mentioning of existentialism--and I realized the internet covers up the possibility of this existential crisis--it gives the illusion of community--it gives the illusion of something being "out there"--so one is able to put this existential crisis off (for a while--i know i am facing one now and it is due to the internet and how i mistook it as a "hero" when it possesses the qualities of "anti-hero")
thanks for listening, Mary, it is an idea which is only now forming in me-
Bobbi

Subject: Re: anti-hero topic and re: internet communication

Hmm, I will have to reread your email again. I do know that the internet does
give me a false security. I teach an online class, and I surprise myself with my
rants, but I don't think that is what you are telling me. That is why I will
need to reread this (over and over) again.

  Thanks.

  Anthony,
The words I sent were not my own but a quote I sent from Robert Kelly and Birgit
Kempker's
book "Shame"--it is a book in which they discuss the issue of "Shame" and only
shame--it's an
interesting book in that it holds to this theme/it examines this issue (shame)
in exhaustive detail
due to the very personal/ interpersonal way in which it is written, written both
in German and English.
It is not a scholarly text but an interpersonal discussion of rare honesty.
I was not attempting to discuss Nietzsche's philosophy but rather to respond to
Mary's request for ideas
on the anti-hero (Anny called Nietzsche hero and anti-hero both)(your links did
not work but sent me to
google sign in page so I'm sorry I was unable to read them)
I felt, in terms of the idea of "anti-hero" which becomes increasingly vague as
I think about it, that
this passage (by Kelly and Kempker) illustrates an aspect of the anti-hero. I
agree with you that
most anti-heros find it hard to live up to their thoughts but, as Alan pointed
out, heros are known
for their actions.


Here is another quote from this book: "I am ashamed of myself because language
never ends"--this is
the shame I feel whenever I post on lists (or even (maybe especially)
backchannels at this point).
(something I have come to realize--impulse I feel and then regret acting
upon--in communicating via
internet--but that's another topic--having nothing to do with your response in
the least--I appreciate
your response--but more re: internet: the "illusion" of communication vs. the
misunderstandings which
follow due to limitations of email communications coupled with fact that I
realize I imagine some
"invisible listener" as I do when I write poetry--but as I say in response to
who I write for I always
use this complete sentence: "I write to an invisible listener who may or may not
exist"--for me, the
internet makes me feel ever more certain that there is no invisible listener--I
feel internet
communications require a different set of rules, rules I have yet to understand.
And so, I would like
to respond to Mary's question re: the anti-hero and, in spite of the fact that I
know this will jive
badly with that terrible cover of "person of the year" or whatever, I feel I'd
like to suggest to
Mary that the internet is the anti-hero. It puts off the existential crisis
(thank you A. but I do
not hold you responsible) that lurks beneath and erupts suddenly after veneer of
internet/ illusion
of connection and communication when truly it is a blank screen and what we
imagine. I find it more
painful than 3-d life. So I'd say the internet is the anti-hero (but that's just
for this early a.m.
with little sleep cause I'm just a stupid human being...most obviously)

Thank you,
Bobbi

To comment on long poems, I have recently worked on an epic piece that I shall submit for publication shortly. It is indeed a long and well awaited piece that I wrote endlessly night and day for two months straight. This consisted of staying indoors far beyond the cabin fever us writers are used to. When writing a long poem, one decides to drift off into a space they feel comforted in, and almost lost as if the world around us has completely vanished and has been sucked away. Time tends to fall apart and doesn't really exist while doing such a thing.

 I think while I wrote this epic piece and selected other works into this book, I had felt to myself;

 "Who give a rats arse if someone does not like this piece. I am not writing this piece to become famous nor will I ever... and if I do become such a dreaded and media hacking piece of historical events, so be it. And if I do not become such a thing I know in my heart one thing, I had a barrel full in enlightenment and fulfilled my candlestick to my discretion."

Writing isn't to fulfill the hearts and minds of others, it should be for yourself. I think so anyways...

Thanks for being a reader,

The Distorted Poet~

something new about guts, and about how dictions slip across one =20
another, entwining, shimmering, wisecracking. For Zolf, political =20

'It's a language experiment, a bit of office thievery, a sleight of =20

Desire is the Gasoline of Life
after the Great Farini

In this shifty world

hands with stigmata

in bodice-ripped love stories and
clean-cut magicians
videotape their tricks and
priests sacrifice
deformed children in basements ;

all things truly mysterious
have shorter star turns
than they used to, shackled
in favor of less humble fame ;
I keep an out-of-state empathy
for people like Farini,
the Canadian magician,
"Canada's Houdini,"
whose illusions

had to be moral, Victorian,
occidental, never
scary or disheveled.
This tiny blip
jumped over Niagara
ten times a day=97 ;
hungry, silent, garrisoned in the barrel,
shinnied up the crane in flames.

God demands a broken
and contrite spirit.=A0
You got one with me.
I give you this plump,
ragged animal
hoping for another week's run,
another chance
to make history
from a raw temper.

Bobbie,
  Once again, I will need to reread your emails. I am trying so hard to find something that will capture my students. In a freshman writing/research, this is very difficult. However, they can be very critical--sometimes that is very good, but sometimes they miss the whole point. I am going to see if I can find a book that talks about internet communication in a way that might catch students attention, but also may undermine their previous thoughts/adaptability/etc.for all these types of "new" communication. Do you have any suggestions?

  If anyone has any suggestions, please get them to me.

  Thank you so much.

  Mary,
Let me be more specific.
This realization was inspired from your post and a backchannel I received which helped me realize something
and today I realize it further: the internet is the anti-hero. I will?make that as statement now.
Why?
I am new to internet communication esp. on lists. For me it represented fact that I tend to wake very early
so before my day begins I make some coffee and then I go to lists--at first thinking "how wonderful to connect
with others all over the world"--(a hero, isn't it? the sense that the internet is a hero--allowing one to communicate ideas so easily with so many people)--but now I learn today from a friend that something vile has been said about me on another list (something so untrue it is absurd but how do i argue with it? it only extends the pain but i take this accusation very seriously--does this mean i shall be trapped in the web of the internet forever, trying to explain myself to people i'll never meet/ have no idea about?...well, no chance of being met on the internet as who we really are is there? why am i being accused of something so distant from anything i think or feel? it must be due to my?ignorance of?political orientation of list--but mostly due to my naivete and blindness to fact that when I type a message, I have no idea who will receive it--though the illusion was there for a while that my actions were meaningful in sense of?messages being received as I intended them
 a
nd so I believed it. But there is a someone on the other end who has formed a view of each and all of us though we have no idea what that view is. We just see a blank screen and keep typing...
The idea of "anti-hero"?has traditionally been?represented via the form of a person--and I think also of a lecture by Suzi Gablick when she said something to the effect that the romanticism of the individual artist is over--that sound?is what unifies--therefore language etc. which is just another small idea to support my sense that individual anti-heros no longer really exist. this idea of anti-hero seems to be to have?been appropriated as a cultural norm in many circles (ie; art, poetry etc. but also very much by many in their teens and 20s--there are clothing lines that seem to cater to the "anti-hero look"--so i see it as veneer--it looks like angst (i refer now to existentiaism also the "image" of "rebel") but it is only a "look" the actual experience of it is avoided via technology now, i believe. i mean, people on their cell phones talking to someone else while they're?eating lunch?with a real live person / checking text msgs. rather than speaking--and also internet
 com
munication vs. phone calls or actual visits etc. The illusion of "who" you are speaking to is kept intact--when meeting an actual person there is no illusion--there is just another human facing you: you know what you can and can't say--so many signals like body language, voice, speech, eye contact or lack of etc.
The anti-hero was very important. Someone helped me see this with the mentioning of existentialism--and I realized the internet covers up the possibility of this existential crisis--it gives the illusion of community--it gives the illusion of something being "out there"--so one is able to put this existential crisis off (for a while--i know i am facing one now and it is due to the internet and how i mistook it as a "hero" when it possesses the qualities of "anti-hero")
thanks for listening, Mary, it is an idea which is only now forming in me-
Bobbi

Hmm, I will have to reread your email again. I do know that the internet does
give me a false security. I teach an online class, and I surprise myself with my
rants, but I don't think that is what you are telling me. That is why I will
need to reread this (over and over) again.

Thanks.

Anthony,
The words I sent were not my own but a quote I sent from Robert Kelly and Birgit
Kempker's
book "Shame"--it is a book in which they discuss the issue of "Shame" and only
shame--it's an
interesting book in that it holds to this theme/it examines this issue (shame)
in exhaustive detail
due to the very personal/ interpersonal way in which it is written, written both
in German and English.
It is not a scholarly text but an interpersonal discussion of rare honesty.
I was not attempting to discuss Nietzsche's philosophy but rather to respond to
Mary's request for ideas
on the anti-hero (Anny called Nietzsche hero and anti-hero both)(your links did
not work but sent me to
google sign in page so I'm sorry I was unable to read them)
I felt, in terms of the idea of "anti-hero" which becomes increasingly vague as
I think about it, that
this passage (by Kelly and Kempker) illustrates an aspect of the anti-hero. I
agree with you that
most anti-heros find it hard to live up to their thoughts but, as Alan pointed
out, heros are known
for their actions.


Here is another quote from this book: "I am ashamed of myself because language
never ends"--this is
the shame I feel whenever I post on lists (or even (maybe especially)
backchannels at this point).
(something I have come to realize--impulse I feel and then regret acting
upon--in communicating via
internet--but that's another topic--having nothing to do with your response in
the least--I appreciate
your response--but more re: internet: the "illusion" of communication vs. the
misunderstandings which
follow due to limitations of email communications coupled with fact that I
realize I imagine some
"invisible listener" as I do when I write poetry--but as I say in response to
who I write for I always
use this complete sentence: "I write to an invisible listener who may or may not
exist"--for me, the
internet makes me feel ever more certain that there is no invisible listener--I
feel internet
communications require a different set of rules, rules I have yet to understand.
And so, I would like
to respond to Mary's question re: the anti-hero and, in spite of the fact that I
know this will jive
badly with that terrible cover of "person of the year" or whatever, I feel I'd
like to suggest to
Mary that the internet is the anti-hero. It puts off the existential crisis
(thank you A. but I do
not hold you responsible) that lurks beneath and erupts suddenly after veneer of
internet/ illusion
of connection and communication when truly it is a blank screen and what we
imagine. I find it more
painful than 3-d life. So I'd say the internet is the anti-hero (but that's just
for this early a.m.
with little sleep cause I'm just a stupid human being...most obviously)

Thank you,
Bobbi

is it "cheating" to recognize many collected poems as one "long" poem?

i think we tend to use "long" as a synonym for "epic".  and epic has to
include something of the heroic, right?

olson, writing in the epic american / whitman tradition seems to really
define the american "long" or epic poem.

Naturally. My manuscript (hopefully next book shortly) is indeed an epic (heroic) piece. :-) I will not go into detail, but let's just say it's very apocalyptic. Please feel free to view my website;

Dear all,

Two new reviews up on rhubarb is susan this week. Of a poem by Regina
Derieva, in the St. Petersburg Review, and of Lisa Robertson in a reissue
by BookThug. Find them here:

Visitors will note that now comments on the blog are moderated. Someone
(or someones) over the past week has been leaving harassing comments on
the blog. My hope is that they are trying to harass you, and not me, and
so requiring moderation for a month or two will drive them away.

Yours,

Dear Mary,
Maybe we can backchannel? All this re: internet being anti-hero is just my own sense of it/ there are
no books on it--when you wrote "anti-hero" combined with responses juxtaposed with issues current
in my life re: internet--it all just
seemed to mean something I needed to grasp--I will try to substantiate it--please keep in mind I'm an
insomniac/ wake at 4a.m/ drink a lot of coffee...so glad when 3-d day begins--internet communications
taking much more out of me than 3-d ones--that is basis of my theory--but I will look for sources as
well...or at least try to write something coherent about it and
pass it on to you if it seems to jell...sounds like an interesting class--someone, age 20, said to me,
"my generation has no culture. can't you see that?" and that has been lingering in my mind as well...

Bobbie,
  Once again, I will need to reread your emails. I am trying so hard to find
something that will capture my students. In a freshman writing/research, this is
very difficult. However, they can be very critical--sometimes that is very good,
but sometimes they miss the whole point. I am going to see if I can find a book
that talks about internet communication in a way that might catch students
attention, but also may undermine their previous thoughts/adaptability/etc.for
all these types of "new" communication. Do you have any suggestions?

  If anyone has any suggestions, please get them to me.

  Thank you so much.

  Mary,
Let me be more specific.
This realization was inspired from your post and a backchannel I received which
helped me realize something
and today I realize it further: the internet is the anti-hero. I will?make that
as statement now.
Why?
I am new to internet communication esp. on lists. For me it represented fact
that I tend to wake very early
so before my day begins I make some coffee and then I go to lists--at first
thinking "how wonderful to connect
with others all over the world"--(a hero, isn't it? the sense that the internet
is a hero--allowing one to communicate ideas so easily with so many people)--but
now I learn today from a friend that something vile has been said about me on
another list (something so untrue it is absurd but how do i argue with it? it
only extends the pain but i take this accusation very seriously--does this mean
i shall be trapped in the web of the internet forever, trying to explain myself
to people i'll never meet/ have no idea about?...well, no chance of being met on
the internet as who we really are is there? why am i being accused of something
so distant from anything i think or feel? it must be due to my?ignorance
of?political orientation of list--but mostly due to my naivete and blindness to
fact that when I type a message, I have no idea who will receive it--though the
illusion was there for a while that my actions were meaningful in sense
of?messages being received as I intended them
 a
nd so I believed it. But there is a someone on the other end who has formed a
view of each and all of us though we have no idea what that view is. We just see
a blank screen and keep typing...
The idea of "anti-hero"?has traditionally been?represented via the form of a
person--and I think also of a lecture by Suzi Gablick when she said something to
the effect that the romanticism of the individual artist is over--that sound?is
what unifies--therefore language etc. which is just another small idea to
support my sense that individual anti-heros no longer really exist. this idea of
anti-hero seems to be to have?been appropriated as a cultural norm in many
circles (ie; art, poetry etc. but also very much by many in their teens and
20s--there are clothing lines that seem to cater to the "anti-hero look"--so i
see it as veneer--it looks like angst (i refer now to existentiaism also the
"image" of "rebel") but it is only a "look" the actual experience of it is
avoided via technology now, i believe. i mean, people on their cell phones
talking to someone else while they're?eating lunch?with a real live person /
checking text msgs. rather than speaking--and also internet
 com
munication vs. phone calls or actual visits etc. The illusion of "who" you are
speaking to is kept intact--when meeting an actual person there is no
illusion--there is just another human facing you: you know what you can and
can't say--so many signals like body language, voice, speech, eye contact or
lack of etc.
The anti-hero was very important. Someone helped me see this with the mentioning
of existentialism--and I realized the internet covers up the possibility of this
existential crisis--it gives the illusion of community--it gives the illusion of
something being "out there"--so one is able to put this existential crisis off
(for a while--i know i am facing one now and it is due to the internet and how i
mistook it as a "hero" when it possesses the qualities of "anti-hero")
thanks for listening, Mary, it is an idea which is only now forming in me-

Anthony,
The words I sent were not my own but a quote I sent from Robert Kelly and Birgit

Kempker's
book "Shame"--it is a book in which they discuss the issue of "Shame" and only
shame--it's an
interesting book in that it holds to this theme/it examines this issue (shame)
in exhaustive detail
due to the very personal/ interpersonal way in which it is written, written both

in German and English.
It is not a scholarly text but an interpersonal discussion of rare honesty.
I was not attempting to discuss Nietzsche's philosophy but rather to respond to
Mary's request for ideas
on the anti-hero (Anny called Nietzsche hero and anti-hero both)(your links did
not work but sent me to
google sign in page so I'm sorry I was unable to read them)
I felt, in terms of the idea of "anti-hero" which becomes increasingly vague as
I think about it, that
this passage (by Kelly and Kempker) illustrates an aspect of the anti-hero. I
agree with you that
most anti-heros find it hard to live up to their thoughts but, as Alan pointed
out, heros are known
for their actions.


Here is another quote from this book: "I am ashamed of myself because language
never ends"--this is
the shame I feel whenever I post on lists (or even (maybe especially)
backchannels at this point).
(something I have come to realize--impulse I feel and then regret acting
upon--in communicating via
internet--but that's another topic--having nothing to do with your response in
the least--I appreciate
your response--but more re: internet: the "illusion" of communication vs. the
misunderstandings which
follow due to limitations of email communications coupled with fact that I
realize I imagine some
"invisible listener" as I do when I write poetry--but as I say in response to
who I write for I always
use this complete sentence: "I write to an invisible listener who may or may not

exist"--for me, the
internet makes me feel ever more certain that there is no invisible listener--I
feel internet
communications require a different set of rules, rules I have yet to understand.

And so, I would like
to respond to Mary's question re: the anti-hero and, in spite of the fact that I

know this will jive
badly with that terrible cover of "person of the year" or whatever, I feel I'd
like to suggest to
Mary that the internet is the anti-hero. It puts off the existential crisis
(thank you A. but I do
not hold you responsible) that lurks beneath and erupts suddenly after veneer of

internet/ illusion
of connection and communication when truly it is a blank screen and what we
imagine. I find it more
painful than 3-d life. So I'd say the internet is the anti-hero (but that's just

for this early a.m.
with little sleep cause I'm just a stupid human being...most obviously)

Thank you,
Bobbi

Angela---
really glad you brought this up...
I don't think it's cheating....

nor is it cheating to question the status of the long poem, as "epic"
and such...

I always felt that what Laura (Riding) Jackson wrote about the 20th
Century "long poem"
is pretty spot on for me personally too. I don't want to paraphrase it
(I want to say it's in Contemporaries and Snobs, 1928, but it could
be elsewhere....it's been a while, forgive my rust)...

And if one wants to use the term "poem" and "long poem" as the
honorific terms, one could call her The Telling
(the book version, in the early 70s) a "long poem" I suppose (she
wouldn't like that though)--and talk about it in relation to, say,
Ashbery's Three Poems, as kind of a counter to the Pound/OlsonZuk/
Enslin/Ronald Johnson/DuPlessis/S.Howe notion....

Nothing against the latter tradition or genre, but I don't think it's
got a monopoly on the "20th century long poem"
(and in a way Whitman is far less heroic macho than Pound, in a way
"song of myself" or Blake's long works are very modest and personal...
but, nah, don't want to get into that one again. school's out,
etc....)            Pessoa


But, then I wouldn't be being flippant by saying that Beckett's
Trilogy could be a "long poem" as well...
and David Henderson's biography of Jimi Hendrix (or, to some extent,
Baraka's Blues People...) at least as much an epic as Olson, etc...
The 20th century definition of "poem" (and especially "long poem") by
so many standards so narrow (as in "not mere prose" nor
"entertainment"...yet 'of cultural relevance'......

Is it an  "accident" that when "rhyme" (as in end rhyme) became
unfashionable
around the same time
the disconnect between many "poetry" and "prose" conventions became
greater....

Bye bye, American century, oh country-built-on-cars and electricity
cars that could've run on alcohol (until prohibition).
Insert Poundian ideogram here. (ugh)....

It's personal as a freezing December...Kosmic Kulchur..
In other news (that stays news), Leonard Cohen is inducted into the
rock and roll hall of fame the same day Madonna is...)
Langston Hughes and John Cage didn't get enough votes this time (like
Art Monk).

when i visit a friend in seattle who does steel sculpture, i sometimes gaze
out at his backyard. it contains several brooded heaps or constellations of
scrap material for future work. the pleasure of scrap-pile gazing is a bit
mysterious to me but i do seem to stop and look at such things. heaps of
art? the raw material all piled up and ready to go? wallace stevens said "I
do not know which to prefer, The beauty of inflections Or the beauty of
innuendoes, The blackbird whistling Or just after." Or just before, in this
case.

these days, peter, when i look at such things, some of your images
invariably come to mind also.

mind you, "beach wrack poem" is not a pile of scrap. it is as though the
letters have grown organically through some sort of unmined but mindy
lettristic mineral process from the wall of a cave. not code but language.
natural language.

'natural language' is an interesting term. in computer science, it refers to
languages used as a native tongue by a group of speakers, as opposed to
computer languages, for instance. though, as with most uses of the word
'natural', the distinction becomes less useful over time.

terrific piece, peter. thanks.

Thanks Jim,
Natural language makes me think of "organic language". I am always aware of
the stylistic nature of font design and letterforms, and can't resist the
attempt to erode.
"...The blackbird whistling Or just after." - I love that.

Since Jim offered the long story, here is mine.

First thing before coffee I switch on the pc and this morning on The New
York Times I watched the Audio Slide on China's seafood industry, a series
of articles grouped under the title: Choking on Growth that the New York
Times has been offering for a while. Contaminated water for the fish which
is then poured on the surrounding land and reminded me of some vegetables I
ate that tasted like rotten fish. I then checked my mail and saw P.
Ciccariello's work. Useless to say, I saw the fish again and ...

Thinking of what is "a long poem," one, or myself that is, realizes
there are really two kinds of this in one's experience.
       There is "a long poem" and then there is  "along poem."
       The long poem is an immense architecture, containing a great
many objects--by turns a museum, a library, a housing of documents, a
topology and geography of land and cityscapes, a vast series of halls
of historical exhibit and allusions.  Words are arranged all along
walls and ceilings, floors--with doors and windows, mirrors, images,
rugs, a plethora of things in which one observes in each "the hand of
the creator."  (And the ear, eye, mouth, nose--)  One enters into a
structure, and behaves with a sense of that, at least for the first
reading.

         Walt Whitman, who 'longed" in a sense to make a long
poem--instead produced a strati--the archaeological layers of
sediments which shifted from  edition to revised and added to and
rearranged edition of Leaves of Grass.
           Strati which also occur serially--
            Stratiseriality--one might call it--"Strativariously" so
to speak--or even on a clear day--"Stratispherically"--although even
on these to recall  that "my voice goes after/what my can't reach."

         Significantly Whitman's changes and revisings, , additions,
subtrractions-- only came to an "end" with the "Deathbed Edition."

         Since the poem is "Leaves of Grass"--of course each time
seeing "leaves of grass" one may be reminded that the poem --and
Walt--are "still among the living," for the real long poem for Whitman
was:  "the greatest poem, these United States."

        Of course, Whitman is a 19th Century poet, not Twentieth as
discussed here, but I think of him and his work being a long poem
which is only now, even right now,  just in a moment of the poem which
"keeps on going" as the tongues which are the leaves of grass keep on
growing year after year after year.  The "Deathbed Edition" only marks
the "end" of that particular phase of the poem, the one over which a
living Walt had "final say."  After that, it has continued on with
whoever reads it, and even sitting unread, is a potential for compost,
rotting away back into the earth to regenerate among worms the seeds
of the leaves of grass.

    A serial poem, a strati of versions--simultaneously still in
print--the "Original" version--and--the "Deathbed"--and the "in
between" versions not as celebrated, widely discussed as the "book
end" versions--

       But then, that is not a "long poem" in the architectural
sense--as the ones discussed here are.  Musical and architectural
elements create the immense structure of the "long poem."

   A long poem may be like unto:  "In my Father's House are many mansions."

   It could be like "the Mansion on the Hill."


       The "along poem" for me is quite different.  It's the poems and
poets one reads in any old version of the text one may find any old
where, through a lifetime of living with the "along poem," which is
the poem, poet, works of same, that one never stops reading over and
over and over and over again.  Rather than having to enter into a
magnificent structure as with a long poem, along poem is one that
inhabits oneself and becomes a part of one's vision, hearing,
memories, associations and one no longer knows some days is the poem
one's along " shadow--or is one the "along shadow" of the poem?

   Of course a long poem may be also an along poem--

      One or another of these along poems is always with one, near at
hand.  Ready for any calamity, there to be read over and over again in
any number of sudden circumstances--an accident, an arrest, a sudden
eviction, getting lost, having to wait hours in a line, finding
oneself somewhere where the only words understood are the poems along
with one.
      Those poems never stop and become the "longest poems" one ever knew.

      It is the not the "length" on the printed page, but the length
through time of the poem's effects--which truly make both a long poem
and an along poem.

         Many long poems may simply end at the final page, while a
very short poem may know no end in a life of being an along poem, just
as a long poem might also, if one so finds it to be.

          Years ago, with a Russian, I served as interpreter in a
"heated" discussion a Ukrainian poet and  Bob Cobbing had concerning
the creation of the world's longest known palindrome.
       The Ukrainian poet had produced a four page palindrome, which
he claimed was the longest such kind of poem ever yet achieved.
        The Ukrainian language, it turns out, is uncannily well suited
for the creation of palindromes, so there is a long tradition of them,
and a consciousness of "just how far one may go."  And then--even
further--four pages--who knows?--
         Bob's contention was that he had written a palindrome of just
a few words, but since it is a "round"--it goes round and round and
round--like a perpetual motion machine wheel--round and round and
round--for ever!!
      Granted the Ukrainian's palindrome was much "longer" in terms of
"length"--in terms of NUMBERS--of words, of pages--
        But Bob's palindrome was much much, ever and ever forveer so
much longer because it--brief, compact, "simple"--had DURATION--far
greater than any mere four pages and thousands of words--

      This conversation had a weird palindromic form to in itself--in
that the Ukrainian would speak to a Russian, who understood Ukrainian,
and who would put it into German--so I could put it into English for
Bob--and then back into German for the Russian who put it back into
Ukrainian for the Ukrainian.
       Instead of four palindromic pages--four persons--and then
instead of that being the "longest"--there was the "round" of going
back and forth like this for a series of discussions on many important
questions of poetry and length and time.
         So in a sense, the possibility existed for a palindromic form
of interlocution-- as well as a perpetual motion one--the "never
ending" examples and discussion of poems, poetry--

         Regardless of the "length" of this event in terms of numbers
of minutes, numbers of words, even of things printed handed back and
forth--this of course has turned into an "along piece" from "a long
time ago, " still "going on."

"...brooded heaps..."

I don't know of that is a form or expression, or not, but I like it. As if, any compilation of clutter becomes a form through which one kind or other of "brooding" is expressed. As say, unfinished poems in a pile in a corner of the studio.

x-listed:

hi, All

I'm putting together a quickie packet for my creative writing course, poems from internet lists that I'm on, primarily, of poets who address issues of environmental change and climate change, from various perspectives. (one of the most intriguing perspectives i find, for example, is Majora Carter's Bronx Initiative, which is, in part, about providing employment & sustainable living opportunities for folks.)

So, if you  have anything you don't mind sharing with a few students, please send along some poems. I'd like the little packet to have approximately 10-15 poems, since we're also reading chapbooks & a couple of fiction anthologies.

FYI (for those of you on other lists with me, I'm sending this off to Cave Canem & WOM-PO, as well, so please don't forward.)

Please backchannel, unless you're into forwardchannelling, of course.

(still) (nearly) winterly,


Metta

Nothing. Nothing at all. But I recently read an essay by Llosa that makes a convincing case for Marley being considered a hero. The man, Mario Vargas, is not at all a reactionary ( he's been accused of being one.). Are there any good Bob Marley movies out there. I find Marley far more compelling than Dylan, although they're both top tier pop music talents. Unlike Dylan, Marley is something of a revered religious figure, emblematic of his Rastafarian beliefs.

There are lots of Bob Marley movies,  I like them all. Rebel Music, Bob
Marley: A Spiritual Journey, and Catch A Fire are all interesting.
Gregory Stephens has a book about Bob Marley, Frederick Douglass & Ralph
Ellison as integrative ancestors, On Racial Frontiers.  One of the
things about Bob Marley is that a new generation of musicians--and of
course musicians in many other genres besides reggae--reinvent & keep
his music alive & growing.  Two of my favorites are the Charlie Hunter
Quartet's Natty Dread & Chant Down Babylon, where at last Bob Marley
gets his African-American audience, & better still -- collaborators.
I'd love to read the Llosa essay, can you give a reference?  Hero?  Yes
certainly, and a genius.

Marley and Dylan have one thing in common, though: I'm tired of both.

no, there isn't a case that has to be made on Marley's behalf. But the fact that LLosa wrote such an appreciative essay was interesting. I'm merely responding to that essay.

sure: the book i was reading is entitled "The Language of Passion." It's a collection of LLosa's newspaper articules, written, I think, while he was living in Spain.

I saw Bob Marley perform as part of an day -night concert at Harvard Stadium
MC by Dick Gregory--back in the late 70's=--
(i stumbled on footage of it at you tube--)

he was fantastic--on stage over two hours--and was part of the small group
of person, about 7 or 8--allowed to sit facing him at a long cafeteria type
table set up on the sidelines of the football field--and talk/interview--

the only other musician i have ever met who had truly an Aura, a great
spirituality, commitment, energy and a sense also of fragility, like a
deer--was Don Cherry--they shared a world vision they had of /for/with
music--

Bob Marley as a musician are i think as yet underrated in what he
accomplished in moving from the early  rude boys ska days and very simple
tunes and covers--to the music he was forging later as his vision grew
greater and more powerful, more world embracing--

he was one of those very rare human beings in whom there is another
light--being radiated outwards--through him -into the world--a light of
great hope and great change--great beauty--great energy--

for days and days after meeting him it felt as though as some kind of
electric charge was still reverberating through and out of me phsyucially
and in the spiritual sense--

he was able to communicate this to whole stadiums the world over as well as
through hundreds of millions of radios, boom boxes, videos, movies,
images--the sound carries on throughout the world--


He had a very soft speaking voice and gave very precise answers to questions
and asked many of his own--

it wasn't like being in the presence of a "superstar" at all--a very humble
person in the sense a deeply spiritual being is--

he didn't have any "self-absorption"--very rare indeed in anyone let alone a
being in his place--

he radiated outward, into and through the world--the vibrations and
reverberations--

greater than the person --who was the bringer of them--

and brought others into a greater sphere as it were of the meaning of being
on a "globe" together--

that gregory stephens book disturbed me when i looked at it some many
years ago now.  it seemed to me that rather than being a project in
favor of multi-racial hybridity or indeterminacy, there were
undercurrents of ... well, a bit of white ressentiment, perhaps. maybe
this is overstating the case, but what i thought might have had some
promise turned out to be... something other than what i'd thought it
might be.

Yeah well I'm not tired of Bob Marley, as you can guess.  I hope it
never happens, but there is a fixed body of work, even though the
Marleys & lots more continue to work with it, & out of it.  I was very
interested to read your account, David, particularly what you say about
his way of speaking.  I never saw Bob Marley perform but listen to
interviews --and am always stunned by the difference between his
speaking and singing voice.  Even after years I have to still laugh in
incomprehension when I listen to him speak, there was absolutely no
compromise with that accent, man.  But when he sings: every word is
absolutely clear, or nearly every word (he has such a great vocabulary),
even though the phrases don't always add up to absolute sense.  But the
songs are packed dimensionally with other kinds of sense.  One of things
I most admire about him is the absolute discipline of moving from those
early recordings, when he was 16, relentlessly through 20 years of
composition, activism, and performance.  He made pretty good choices
with producers & labels, & then founding his own company Tuff Gong which
continues to release great material.  One of the movies, Catch A Fire I
think, has extensive interviews with Chris Blackwell & Tony Platt, who
engineered Catch a Fire I think, the Wailers' first Island record:
that's really fascinating to see how the music was put together.  Poetry
doesn't know or do anything like that.

I was really excited about the Gregory Stephens book as two of its three
figures are people who interest me greatly: Bob Marley & Frederick
Douglass.  So it was disappointing to discover that it was kind of
muddy, in some way, & hard to get through.  So I haven't read it
properly but keep going back in hopes.  Oh, on another sort of slog:
crunching, chipping, pounding, shoveling away all morning trying to get
the car out past what the snow plough left me.  Failure, bitter failure.
Snow is the most maddening philosopher I've ever tried to grapple with.

that gregory stephens book disturbed me when i looked at it some many
years ago now.  it seemed to me that rather than being a project in
favor of multi-racial hybridity or indeterminacy, there were
undercurrents of ... well, a bit of white ressentiment, perhaps. maybe
this is overstating the case, but what i thought might have had some
promise turned out to be... something other than what i'd thought it
might be.

what a moving tribute to Marley. You also mentioned Don Cherry. He played a special type of trumpet, maybe it was a piccolo trumpet. I played trumpet in high school. I wanted to be Miles Davis, unusual for a white kid in the late seventies.
When it became clear to me that I wouldn't be able to become  Miles  Davis, I  tried  to  look at the world without blinders and become  Nat Adderly on the cornet.  I also played the guitar.  Being ambitious,  at one time I wanted to be Miles Davis and Jeff Beck. I wanted to be older and famous and without, if I remember correctly, acne.

I believe the Museum of Southern Ohio in Portsmith will be doing a tree
wrack exhibit using trees that washed up along the Ohio River sometime =
soon.

I believe Tom Bridwell will be central to this. It might be interesting =

My oldest son called this morning from Thailand, where he has lived most of
the last five years.  There are elections going on there, also, perhaps in a
more or at least, as,  "open" way--under the rule of the military
Junta--than in the USA, under its own form of corporate-fascist Junta.
      Despite the signs outside villages that say "No money for votes," my
son said that al day and night trucks and cars equipped with loudspeakers
blasting campaign slogans and alluring music pour through the hamlets and
towns, with the various candidates or their representatives stopping in
strategic locations to hand out money in exchange for the pledge of a vote.

       There has also been a widespread phenomena of the appearance in trees
of hand-made signs proclaiming "Jesus is the Way."  Evangelical Christians
are a very tiny minority, so even though people know that actual persons
must have put the signs there, since no one has seen them do it, and many
have never seen an Evangelical Christian, there is a popular belief the
signs "just appear," like many other  phenomena in nature.
        My son lives outside Roi Et and for a while lived in a another small
city on the Mekong River, looking straight at the hills of Laos.  Photos he
sent from there showed the gradual engulfment of Western history within the
flows of another kind of time.  An ancient, beautifully weathered and fading
Catholic Church built by the Vietnamese, covered in writing in the
Vietnamese language, the bare bones of a former US Air Force mini-base for
the bombing of the Ho Chi Minh Trail and Cambodia, some remains of French
colonial architecture.  All relics of departed foreigners, slowly turning
into "timeless" Thai edifices in the wash and patinas of time.
    The second night his mother visited there, while they were eating
outside with my son's new-born daughter, two young elephants came up to
them, one of them playing a harmonica.  (There is a music school for
elephants in Thailand, and the elephants  have released a number of CDs.)
    Roi Et is in north-central Thailand; far enough from Bangkok that the
elections don't seem of much importance.  According to my son, the whole
region believes that as long as there is nominally a King, whoever runs the
government really doesn't matter.  Can the government change the weather?
Can the government change Time? My son says that Time in the Western sense
exists only a few decades into the past, and  everything before that exists
in a completely different time of legends and stories.
      That time gradually absorbs the Western time into itself.  It's
wonderful to have happy shiny machines for music and communications,
cars--but al these happy shining  things are more to do with Buddha than
anything else.  And farther north, there are no Buddhas or any other
Gods--despite untold centuries of efforts to convert them to all sorts of
religions, the people have remained stead fastedly Animists. Why believe in
unseen "Gods" when the animals and plants with their spirits are all around
one?

         The 2000 election set a precedent in that a president was not
determined by an election, but by a Court.  The 2004 election was riddled
with fraud.  Voting machines have been proven just as easy to manipulate as
voters purchased off the street, a method that in its heyday is thought to
have been the cause of death of Edgar Poe his repeated "votes" being
purchased with drinks.   If anything, electronic/digital apparati are "far
better" for creating phantom voters than even the legendary  old cemeteries
of Cook County, where the dead voted away for generations, like George
Romero's zombies returning to the Malls in Dawn of the Dead.
       By the time the dust of the primaries has cleared, and the two
"candidates" spend another billion or two apiece, the fix will already be
in.  Hordes of "phantom" pixel-created "voters" will "vote" and democracy
will be the "representative government" of "virtual reality."
      Persons who complain that the "government" is "out of touch" with
"reality," though correct in a sense, will be shown "not to exist" as
"virtual realities" the only realities that "count."  In effect, their
"identities" will have been stolen and donated to the needy--all those
phantoms in search of a name and an address, a birth date and Social
Security number.
         The invasion and occupation of Iraq was based on forged documents,
cherry picked and doctored intelligence.  Now that intelligence shows there
is no need to rush to war with Iran--it is too late.  After all, if the data
before was not "true," and exposed the incompetence of "American
intelligence," why believe that this report is any more true? On the
contrary, does this not underline in fact its complete falsity?
        A former lie, like a former non-election, leaks into and corrodes
the later "truth" and attempts at a "real election."  The obdurate
persistence of the lie produces, rather than a non-necessity for war--a
heightened demand for it.  Despite all the evidence to the contrary, the
American "government" and the Israeli, are pushing even harder for conflict
with Iran.  By being proven a non-threat, the Iranians have now become "even
more dangerous."  Israel has announced its intention to attack, regardless
of what the Americans deludely think of their "incompetent intelligence."
         The current non-elected government has so radically changed the
laws and rules for the Office of the Presidency and Vice-Presidency, that
which ever fixed candidate lands in those chairs can become a dictator
overnight.  These living-dead "products" of virtual creation will "run the
show" with ever more ruthless disregard for the living and their
"evidences." Those troubled by the seeming gap between "concrete" and
"virtual" realities will be found to be suffering from "hallucinations" and
quietly interred or "disappeared," their former "identities" supplied to
either willing "living bodies," or pixel beings, madly crushing the
entrances to  virtual Malls.
         Many will think that perhaps this invasion from cyber space is
"really" science-fiction, and that it is actually, as in the movies, an
Invasion from Outer Space.  For their benefit, the circulation and sightings
of UFOs will be increased.
         Better to blame "illegal aliens," after all, than the law abiding
"citizens" and "Government" of the Land of the Free.

Primary
To: david.chirot@gmail.com



We are persuaded that none of the so-called front-runners in the
current Democratic primary process may yet represent the true choice
of the people, and suspect they are being foisted on us by a
disproportionate share of media attention, and even speaking time in
the debates.

There is a totally independent primary poll being conducted at

Independent Primary Poll: http://independentprimary.com/

We are encouraging all our participants to make your voice heard for
the candidate you really like before this poll closes at the end of
the day, this coming Tuesday, Dec. 18. This major on-line poll is
being conducted by a consortium of Independent voters around the
county, and is sure to have a significant impact on the real
primaries just about to start.

The groups running this poll do not favor one party or the other,
they vote on issues, and character of the candidate. And they are a
large constituency. Independents make up more than 40 percent of the
electorate, and it is expected there will be several hundred thousand
votes in this poll by the time it closes Dec. 18, so the media is
paying attention.

Just to give you an example, in the recent poll run by Democracy for
America, founded by current DNC chairman Howard Dean, these were the
results out of 154,000 votes cast:

Kucinich 32.97%, Gore 24.77%, Edwards 15.6%, Obama 13.86%, Clinton
4.21%, Richardson 4.09%, Other 2.05%, Dodd 1.56%, Biden 1.12%, Gravel
0.77%

Maybe we should stop letting the corporate talking heads pick our
candidates for us. Especially if you feel that the current tilt of
the coverage of the candidates does not match your first preference,
please make your voice heard now where it will really count.

Independent Primary Poll: http://independentprimary.com/

The poll closes on Tuesday, Dec. 18. So please vote now, and spread
the word to all your lists.

Please take action NOW, so we can win all victories that are supposed
to be ours, and forward this alert as widely as possible.

If you would like to get alerts like these, you can do so at

These are awesomely beautiful, especially 7 through 9 and 11.

I have no idea of the theory behind them, but as aesthetic objects alone
they are mesmerizing. I want to blow them up and make a triptych and cover a
wall with 7 through 9.

My comment about Marley and Dylan notwithstanding, I must admit that I was a
huge fan of both, and an even more avid fan of the former (my undergraduate
entrance essay was written as a paean to Marley. So, needless to say, I was
more than a huge Marley fan. I think it's very sad that his legacy left
behind so much infighting and trading on his name. That being said, I think
Marley was much more heroic than Dylan. Think about the December 1976
assassination attempt on his life (A  ruling party behind it, supposedly
because Marley was gaining such mass appeal that he represented a threat).
Think about the fact that he was on the CIA's "Most Watched List," probably
sharing space with Allende. Marley is so much more than a musician....he's a
Fred Hampton, a Dylan, a Kind David all rolled into one, 5' 3" persona.
Really a beautiful person.

To retract or redact:  I'm tired of the "Legend" idea of compilation and
offering, of re-release and remasterings, of appropriation by surf
communities everywhere, and not of the person that Marley was.

I agree with Mairead that there seem to be levels of meaning in Marley's
music. Just "Mr. Brown" alone is a beautiful piece about a crow that used to
ride around town on the coffin during funerals...really weird stuff. "Mortal
the downpressor, he'll lead the life of sad tomorrow..." A cutting, almost
Biblical attempt at the universal in both its embrace of inherent violence
of life (hexes, death, duppies, etc.) and the need to rise up and confront
those doing the "downpressing."

hiya,

      Kirsten Lavers and myself are no longer working together and therefore
after almost 10 years of making artwork the collaborative partnership
TNWK is moot. From my perspective, as one of two collaborating partners, we
cannot make work as TNWK again and the project falls. We have achieved a
lot, but the impact of transatlantic distance has proved fatally corrosive
and so this particular model of social, domestic, local <----> translocal,
loving, creative collaborative "occurrences" and a complex late-twentieth
<-----> early twenty-first century body of artistic practice is over.  I
hope that in years to come the work will still be discussed as a model of
the possible.

A pox on whatever the probably inevitable sur/subtext of this letter, Chris.
 Oblivious me knew not of this work.
 Talk about Viz Lit, the TNWK archives is a wonderful place.
 My belated congratulations to both of you on what was/is accomplished.

 Sometimes it's just a good time to stop.

 What's still there - separate or ensemble - will keep 'coming out in the wash'.
 I dare speculate!

 Cheery eyed in California!

As great a musician and individual as Bob Marley may have been from
his early days into the 70's, let us not forget that he became toward
the end of his life an integral aspect of Kingston's coke-crazed disco
scene. I'll always remember him for his best music. My favorite song
is Waiting in Vain, but I also really like his early recordings with
the Wailers.

(This is a forward from the Art & Educatio mailing list)


  THE LAST BOOK

(A Project by Luis Camnitzer, sponsored by the National Library of Spain)

Open call for collaborations


---------------------------------
    The Last Book is a project to compile written as well as visual statements in which the authors may leave a legacy for future generations. The premise of the project is that book-based culture is coming to an end. On one hand, new technologies have introduced cultural mutations by transferring information to television and the Internet. On the other, there has been an increasing deterioration in the educational systems (as much in the First World as on the periphery) and a proliferation of religious and anti-intellectual fundamentalisms. The Last Book will serve as a time-capsule and leave a document and testament of our time, as well as a stimulus for a possible reactivation of culture in case of disappearance by negligence, catastrophe or conflagration.

Contributions to this project will be limited to one page and may be e-mailed to lastbook.madrid@gmail.com or mailed to Luis Camnitzer, 124 Susquehanna Ave., Great Neck NY 11021, USA. In case of submission of originals, these will not be returned. The book will be exhibited as an installation at the entrance of the Museum of the National Library of Spain in Madrid at some point of 2008. Pages will be added during the duration of the project, with the intention of an eventual publication of an abridged version selected by Luis Camnitzer, curator of the project. The tentative deadline is March 31, 2008.

This call is open and we hope that it will be resent to as many potential contributors
as possible.

David, my apologies for just taking this line out of all you wrote--apologies in advance if seen as abrupt interruption or disrespectful fragmentation etc. (apologies always necessary in advance in re: to any
internet post from me now due to anticipation of backchannels/ it's 4:30 a.m./ flawed human time
within this hour of imagined conversation when i am merely in a dark room with computer screen in front
of me and the illusion of communication but i just want to say: this invasion from cyber space is
actually actually actually--and yet we are removed from "actually" due to it...important to realize how
much this invasion has altered everything in our existence--bobbi


        Many will think that perhaps this invasion from cyber space is
"really" science-fiction,

thnx JIm
"Far Beyond Silicon Fen" is the only piece on our site that stands on its
own in the medium for which it was intended . . . namely the internet (altho
i would have to add the internet at that point in time . . . without the
kinds of download speeds we have now . . . hence the use of still rather
than moving image . . . we would have preferred at some points to combine
them. .. however etcetera). "Far from Silicon Fen" also makes use of flarf
and has randomising elements in its swf bins . . .

all the other work is documentation related to "live" occurrences or events
circulated elsewhere

Not only did I not forget this, I never even knew it!  And now I know

Wanted to chime in on the Bob Marley discussion -

For all fans & casual admirers of Marley & reggae in general, I must recommend the album

Bob Marley & The Wailers: SOUL REVOLUTION 1 & 2

released on Trojan, recorded in 1969, produced by Lee "Scratch" Perry - disc 1 has the vocal mixes, disc 2 the instrumentals.

The heart pauses at the flicker
of a disposessed lighter

Halfway through
supple mendicant
the only evidence for which
is definition

That we could imagine
some sorta simultaneity

is proof of the rhetoric
Showing you my scars
of periods my bleak semi-
colons

Everywhere you would ever want to pause
is in my skin

Hi all,

I've been invited to write a libretto and, never having written one before, I was wondering if others on this list had any advice.  So far I've been told:

1.  Use lots of vowels -- maximize assonance.
2.  Repeat a lot.
3.  Be short -- don't try to cram too much information or exposition in.

Mostly I'm concerned with musciality (there's that theme again) -- what works to make something more singable.

Many thanks,

Hugh Behm-Steinberg

Subject:      "Wrack" image & Ruins,
              Wrecks & Runes//& a flickr gallery & essay link
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I was interested in the comments re Peter's "Wrack" image and the relation
of the virtual with "natural" or "organic" language.

      In his monumental five decade long labor of love, the 18th Century
Natural History, Buffon writes that perhaps the scaly tail of the beaver is
due to its eating fish.
     Which, "quite naturally," prompted some wag to query in that case, how
long might be M Buffon's tail?--if, of course, he did eat fish!--

      In the "Language" section of "Nature" Emerson writes:
     1.  Words are signs of natural facts.
               ("And ain't that a natural born fact, Jack," as the saying
goes.)
     2. Particular natural facts are symbols of particular spiritual facts.

               (The fish in Peter's image being, say,  Pisces, or the
Christian symbol of the fish, St Peter as a fisher of men, or an allegory of
the fish dying of polluted waters,  or a sign for Fish Fry Fridays--)
      3.  Nature is the symbol of spirit.
              (Completing Emerson's Transcendental and redeeming  version of
the  dreaded Jesuitical machinations known as the syllogism.)

           Very quickly one moves from natural facts to words as their
signs, to "particular" natural facts being symbols of spiritual facts and
then to nature as a symbol of spirit.

           The movement from the natural to the spiritual, from signs to
symbols in a peculiar way seems not unlike what one might call a
"Transcendentalism of the Virtual."  Or, perhaps, a Transcendentalism in
Reverse, in the way that Robert Smithson, after Nabokov, wrote of
construction sites as "ruins in reverse."

          One begins--in this reversal-- from the Transcendental
"spirit"--the Virtual Image--Virtuality being not unlike "spirit" in the
sense that is "there" via symbols (digital codes)--and since particular
spiritual facts are symbols of particular natural facts--(whose signs are
words)--then--"nature is the symbol of spirit."

          In other words, the world is a symbol of the virtual.  Words as
"signs of natural facts" which are "spiritual facts" which are the turning
of nature into the symbol of the spiritual--are both "signs of natural
facts" and symbols of the spirit.  Language and nature are symbols of
spirit--or, Virtuality.

         Spirit is Virtuality. Virtuality is spirituality, and so, in a way,
becomes, is, also virtue  (The shared etymology of the Latin virtus.)

          Virtuality as virtue, as another form of the spirituality which
redeems the "fallen world" by turning it into a "symbol."

         This has a strange effect on the experience of, perception of, the
world, as it no longer exists, but is now world-as-symbol. For, if it is a
symbol, this means the world is not "real."

           The world-as-symbol becomes a place of tourism for the "virtual
eye"-- taking the Surrealists' trips to the flea markets to new heights.

 There are tours now for persons to take in which they are shown the
"signage" and other "symbols" of the virtual that exist in their
neighborhoods.  This form of perception is considered a "virtue."  The poet
Charles Bernstein goes to China and comes back with --what else--but a great
many photos of signs and "symbols."  The disconnect between the English
"mistranslations" from the Chinese is a  "symbolic joke" and illustrative of
one's own virtue as a perceiver of signs and symbols.  (Though i always
wonder if the Chinese might not actually be saying something like--well, we
shall leave that to the reader's imagination.)

      By virtue, so to speak, of this effect of the Virtual, what is seen in
the world are only those things which are signs and symbols of the symbolic
world of the Virtual.

      What one sees in the world is a reflection of the Virtual.  That is,
one recognizes as "real" only those things which one knows from the Virtual.
In a sense the tours of one's neighborhood as a trove of signage and symbols
are a form of training in this recognition of the Virtual  "real" and its
virtues.

      Yet what of those who live, pagans, beyond the pale of the virtues of
Virtual "access?"

        One speaks of the "dependence on foreign oil"--one hears little
about the "dependence on electricity" in terms of access to the "real" as it
is realized in the Virtual.

       Are those who exist beyond electricity's reach those are without
virtue?

        This would seem to be the case for those affected by the following
events:  in Rwanda, when the massacres were to being, all cables, telephone
lines, any electric access, was completely cut off.  Once sealed from the
real Virtual world, the now  Virtual "disappeareds" were removed from the
world as being without virtue.  In Myamar, protests were followed by the
cut-off with the outside world of cable and phone access.  In the world's
largest ever prison, already Walled off from the world, a "refugee Camp,"
the Palestinians of Gaza are disappearing from virtue by virtue of the cut
off of electricity.  When all the lights go out--where will they be?

       If one were to go about cutting off electricity, chopping off cables,
pulling plugs, denying on line access to citizens for various
reasons--controlling who is part of the Virtual and virtuous world--one
might wonder if part of the possibility of this is to inculcate  ever more
"willing suspension of disbelief" in the Virtual and its virtues in the
denizens of the Virtual.

For then will they not ever more willingly accede to the "transparency" of a
new Transparent Eyeball in reverse, the Panoptical Eye of instantaneous
"real time"  surveillance of everyone and access to everyone's files,
images, messages, transactions in order to keep "secure" the virtue of the
Virtual?

The threat of the loss of the Virtual, of being a part of the virtues of the
Virtual, may become a new form of discipline.  And, desirous to not lose
one's sense of Virtual Reality, might not one then accede to entering into a
world wide prison?

To "die" outside the Virtual--or to "Live" as a prisoner.

Along those cheerful lines--Drew Kunz recently invited me to a group
involved with thinking on the artistic developments through time taking the
grid as a proposition for work.  Personally i don't like grids at all(even
though one benefits much of course from the virtues of the electronic
grids--) and personal experience of them has done nothing to to tarnish the
dislike.
   Yet paradoxically, due to this dislike of grids and what they may men in
various circumstances, a great deal of my work has made use of them, far
more than one realized.
       This flickr gallery includes works made with overt and explicit as
well as more covert and implicit grids.  Many are from a series of "Walls"
which will be forthcoming in a book from Otoliths.  The examples here are
often of language that is affected by violence, fire, the wear and tear of
Time, the "dirtiness" of non-Virtual and virtuous existence.
       Attached is an essay "Hidden in Plain Sight" which appeared in
Otoliths which discuss the impact since childhood of construction sites,
crow's nests and found materials on my work and methods.
        The essay has a link to another short piece re Bob Cobbing, my
friend and mentor. Of the two of us jw curry wrote that, outside the
division of "Clean" and "Dirty" Schools of Visual Poetry, there was the
"Quick'nDirty" School of Cobbing and Chirot.  Bob Cobbing was one of the
great geniuses and artists of the 20th Century.  He and Kurt Schwitters,
with Dubuffet, are for me the three most important artists of their times.
       I see their work and what i continue on with as a kind of guerilla
art of survival in the hidden in plain site/sight/cite of the real world, as
opposed to existing solely in the Virtual world which is not real, but a
reflection, though its effects are real.
        This kind of work can be done anytime any where with next to nothing
at all except the everything that is here and there, there, there--found all
around one, right at hand. It is "born" of necessity, the Motherfucker of
Invention.

I am taking a group of students to Ecuador and the Galapagos Island as a part of a short term course.  I am looking for short fiction by recent Ecuadorian authors in translation (Spanish to English).  We will already be reading some novels, the primary text being Jorge Icaza's *Hausipungo* (The Villagers), but I've had no luck in finding shorter works in translations.  Recommendations?  Much obliged.

Hugh,

I have done this a couple of times, and I'd also say write with an
idea that you are willing to have your work cut, possibly arranged &
re-arranged, phrased repeated, etc., i.e. consider the composer a co-
writer, and let her or him do a lot of the work in terms of making
things "singable" and "musical" in whatever sense she or he needs.
One of my best experiences working this way involved the composer,
and a choreographer, and the composer, all having input into the way
the final libretto worked, with some possibilities for improvisation
in each performance as well.

A hair raising article and not unrelated to reggae music's history-
(when i interviewed Peter Tosh we talked five hours in a tiny locked room
guarded by armed members of his entourage, trained also in martial arts, and
there was extra security at the doors leading to the little room where those
guards were--and further off,, in the entrance to the place--we were in the
basement of a cinema--underneath the stage--some police--
less than a year later he was dead--shot during a robbery in his home--)

a great many reggae musicians were killed for political and also gang
related reasons--
gangs often connected with narco-trafficking--
connected with the music business
(all of them--politics-drugs-gangs-business--entangled with each other--)
as anyone who has worked "in the industry" can tell you--
a much "dirtier" and more dangerous world than the cliched hymns to the
liberatory libidinous "revolutionary" aspects of "sex, drugs and
rock'n'roll" (aka prostitution, dead end addiction, violence) ever let on
about--

People can get pretty dogmatic concerning poetry. & they don't have to necessarily know what they're talking about. consider:


I'm always carrying a few books. I had a copy of Philip Larkin's "High Windows"
 & Rod Smith's "Deed" with me at the cafe, both very good books. My friend picked up the Larkin, read a few poems, than held the book up, exclaiming "This is Good."He read from "Deed," held the book up, then slammed it down, exclaiming "This is junk." I didn't get upset. I realized that everyone in D.C. considers him or herself an expert on just about anything. My friend, who doesn't know shit about poetry and is still my friend, seemed to feel he was a poetry expert. I've learned not to try to defend a book I know is good to someone who says otherwise when the other person doesn't have the vocabulary needed to understand the book in question.

I'd talk to the composer.  But it couldn't hurt to read a few
American libretti or song settings, and listen to how they
sing--Stein/ Thompson's Four Saints in Three Acts, Agee/Barber
Knoxville, Summer of 1915, for instance, both lyrical and tonal,
which your composer might not be. Get his/her recommendations.

Seems good ole Led Zep had a successful bash there in London. I like it when musicians old enough to be my parents get together & rock. I grew up with Zep. I've haven't discovered anyone who dislikes that band. There must be a few Zep haters out there.

Damn, this is a Poetry listserv. I'll try to get back on page.

I didn't feel it needed video at all. There's so much video on the net. More
interesting without video, trying to do something that isn't so g(l)utted
and is coming to grips with net media rather than shovelling old media into
a new environment. I know people like video but they also like big macs.

Elsewhere Artist Collaborative
2008 residencies for artists, writers, and cultural producers

Elsewhere, an arts production site and experimental museum in downtown
Greensboro, NC, is seeking artists, writers, and cultural producers for
residencies during its Spring, Summer, and Fall 2008 seasons. Set within a
former thrift store housing a 58-year collection of American surplus,
thrift, and antiques, Elsewhere invites experimental creators to utilize th=
e
immense collection of objects to pursue site-specific material, conceptual,
and/or technologically-based projects. Elsewhere's building=97two storefron=
ts
on the ground floor, a 14-room boarding house on the second, and warehouse
on the third=97provides dynamic architectures for the creation and
installation of works. Artists live and work within transforming
installations; these interactive environments become platforms for
re-conceptualizing the theory and practice of art-making as an ongoing
process of exchange in community. Experimenting with museum-as-medium withi=
n
a store where nothing is for sale, Elsewhere offers an unparalleled
framework for art practices, processes, and productions outside the
traditional gallery, museum, and residency systems. The complete call for
artists, residency brochure (PDF), and application deadlines are available
at http://www.elsewhereelsewhere.org/residencies.html.  Email George Scheer=
,
Collaborative Director, at residencies@elsewhereelsewhere.org for an
application.

DEADLINES

Spring: April 1st to May 31st (final deadline January 25th 5pm)
Summer: June 1st to August 31st (final deadline February 22nd 5pm)
Fall: September 1st to October 31st (final deadline May 23rd 5pm)

What function does one perform as an "integral aspect"? I wouldn't assume
that drug involvement = bad, as I'm sure Dylan could attest....

Hi Hugh

There are no hard and fast rules. It all depends on what kind of work you're
making, musically speaking, and what kind of collaboration you have with the
composer. Libretti can include speaking, of course, and sprachgesung. I'd
listen to a bunch of operas - Glass and Berg might be good to start. When
Berg did Woyczek, for instance, he just used Buchner's play. Glass used a
bunch of numbers for Einstein on the Beach. Anything is possible. But given
that: I've written three libretti, and these are my Handy Hints for Aspiring
Librettists:

It's important to remember that singing something takes much longer than
saying something. As a rule of thumb, around three times as long. So try
reading your work out loud three times, it will give you some idea of the
time it takes. If your tongue stumbles over something, change it.

Polysyllables and so on are worth avoiding unless you have a good reason to
have them there.

Avoid recitative at all costs. If you want to use a chorus, _think very hard
about what it means_. Choruses can often be very silly in modern operas. And
leave any repetitions up to the composer's discretion.

Try to think about the theatricality of what you're making. Which can
include drama but not necessarily. And linked to this, don't waste stage
time. An hour-long opera will probably have a libretto 20 pages long (in
short lines) so that doesn't give you much room to move.

Remember that composers and opera companies often consider librettists as
junior partners in the art. (Opera directors don't necessarily, but it's a
weird world).

Cheers

Alison

David,

 I find all this fascinating.

 <Words as "signs of natural facts">

 Words or letters with programmed meaning exist regardless of context, or
lack of context. With the objectification of letters/words/poem, the poetic
object begins to achieve virtual self, yet lacks any form of utilitarianism
and is considered useless, without purpose. Wracks, wrecks, ruins by common
standards lose function, usefulness, and even the right to exist. Yet true
possibility, marvel and surprise lurk there in the fragmented, the
impracticable, the unfeasible and the unknowable.

The Flickr link is superb!

Well, I may not really be a Zep hater, but I did walk out on them during one of
their first American tours -- They were the headliners one night of a Rock
festival I went to -- but by the time they got on stage, I'd already seen
performances by Buddy Guy and Johnny Winter and Jethro Tull (who had more blues
to them in those early days -- I rushed out and bought their LP -- already had
lots of Buddy Guy and the first Johnny WInter) -- Whole Lotta Love sounded like
the Yardbirds doing Willie Dixon -- hell, it almost was the Yardbirds doing
Willie Dixon -- but with a less interesting vocalist and no harp --- They were
OK -- but compared to the likes of Buddy Guy and Johnny WInter, just OK --

That's a terrific essay, David. And some fascinating quotations, as well,
such as Emerson's "Words are signs of natural facts." Which reminds me of a
related sentiment expressed by Socrates. Perhaps it was in the Republic, but
it could have been in any number of the dialogues because Socrates and some
straw man were discussing the 'nature' of 'the good'. Socrates was seeking a
definition. The straw man gave examples of good things, good people, good
familial relations, etc. Socrates said (and I paraphrase) "great, but I'm
looking for what's common to all these examples. There must be something
common to them, musn't there? Or we wouldn't use the same word to describe
them: good."

The idea that there must be something common to all the examples because we
call them all 'good' is 'essentialist' and, from a contemporary perspective,
rather naive about language. I suppose we are all essentialists from time to
time because language itself is ineradicably essentialist: a 'chair' is a
fuzzy class of things; words can sometimes be made to refer to 'real' things
in the 'real' world, but mostly, in any particular sentence, the things
referred to are not particular but, instead, are erm virtual. figures of
speech, as it were/was/isn't/could be/should be/is supposed to be/never will
be/is/was thought to be/was lied to be/was hoped to be/was inferred to
be/was deduced to be/was convenient to be/was cajoled to be/was exhaustively
and partisanly reasoned to be.

There is a great deal of hype about the splendor of creating virtual worlds
but we do that whenever we open our mouths. Or write. Fiction is merely
explicit about it. The 'real' and what we take for the 'real' are forever
swirling together in a drama of masks where it sometimes is impossible to
distinguish the 'real' from the supposed, the inferred, the imaginary, the
linguistic, the desired, the feared, the loved, the incorporeal, the
disembodied, the realm of forms or the veil of Maya. Language is a forest of
imaginary/ideal classes. It's hard to point to see a tree for the forest. I
mean a real tree. Like that one over there.

Yet, for all that, it's indisputable that we are getting banged hard. There
is a real world! But what we think it to be is mostly made of language and
media. Except our own immediate world, where we can sometimes do a bit more
testing and verification. In such a world belief is crucial. If we cannot
know the way something is, we have to choose who to believe about that
thing.

I don't know what it means to say that 'words are signs of natural facts'.
It supposes a stronger connection between language and a way things are than
is reasonably merited. Also, 'nature', the more we think about it, comes
down to things like the laws of physics, which are patently not natural but
are, instead, human constructions, human theories--and necessarily
incomplete theories that will change upon deeper reflection over the course
of centuries as the body of assumptions and primitive terms is enlarged to
accomodate deeper experience. And what was thought to be 'natural' or 'a
priori true' will turn out to be like the idea that parallel lines never
meet--which was cited by early philosophers repeatedly as the exemplar of an
'a priori truth' but turns out to be an independent axiom which can be
negated to form an equally consistent non-Euclidean geometry.

Yet, for all that, despite the epistemic uncertainties and incompleteness of
any and all sentient knowing now and (seemingly) forevermore, it seems we
do, over time (if we have much left) learn something.

But I digress. Apologies.

I really liked the, uh, central 'conceit' of your essay--as in the
constructions of the 'metaphysical poets':

"The movement from the natural to the spiritual, from signs to symbols in a
peculiar way seems not unlike what one might call a "Transcendentalism of
the Virtual."  Or, perhaps, a Transcendentalism in Reverse, in the way that
Robert Smithson, after Nabokov, wrote of construction sites as "ruins in
reverse."

That's rather beautiful, humorous, learned, and intriguing all at once. And
the development of the notion proceeds in an equally fascinating way; the
idea of "world-as-symbol" and 'spirit as virtual'. You are playful and
earnest in it at the same time, mocking of it and and yet marshall an
interesting argument for it.

One of the things I take from the essay is a deeper appreciation of the
intertwined 'nature' of world and language. We can't deny either--world or
language. Can't deny the existence of a world independent of language, yet
recognize how very dependent they must be in any sentient being--unless it
is possible to transcend language and symbol to direct apprehension of the
world and human actions and meaning.

I have my doubts about that possib. And, even if it were possible (and it
is), I wonder how extensive that sort of knowledge can be--I think we need
both freshness of apprehension and language.

Which may relate to our shared interest in visual poetry where language and
world are examined somewhat differently.

All the best, David, and thanks for the essay and the terrific links.

second life third life

begin by setting out directions, these are the five healthy directions,
the middle direction is one of exhaustion and ecstasy, then in the
direction opposite the middle direction set out the last direction, which
is one of wounding and suffering. if the middle direction is reception,
the last direction is penetration, if the last direction is reception, the
middle direction is penetration. set the house in order from the middle
direction outward, these are the spokes which narrow to the point of
intersection between the middle direction and last direction. now forget
the four directions, concentrate on the spokes, the point, the middle and
the last direction. then concentrate on the spokes, forget the point, the
middle and the last direction, the spokes come close to the point, forever
close to the point, but the point is absent, emptiness, emptiness radiates
outward between the spokes. now forget the spokes, emptiness radiates
among the ghosts of them, the spokes are hungry ghosts, they gnaw at
emptiness, they are wounded, they are defeated, they disappear. now think
of emptiness, think of nothing else, think of nothing. now you have laid
out the house and the world and the word, but you are in ignorance, you do
not know house or world or word, if you think house or world or word you
must begin again, laying out the five directions and so forth. now you
have come to an end and you are ready to begin, you have come to the
beginning, and you are ready to end. now continue.

you must imagine now yourself and house and world and word annihilated,
you must imagine annihilation of annihilation. you must imagine almost all
pleasure, among taste of delight and touch of exaltation, and among scent
of numinous being and sight of untold beauty and hearing of harmonious
sounds. now you must imagine another being joined to yourself and house
and world and word, you must imagine penetration reception and reception
penetration, you must imagine fullness and overflowing of delight. now you
will find you are creating and you are making sheave-woman and sheave-man,
you are sheave-woman and sheave-man, you have sheave-sight-and-sound, you
have sheave-touch-and-scent, you have sheave-taste-and-mind, you have
sheave-passion and sheave-ecstasy. now you will walk and remember, you
will remember everything, and you will speak and hear, see and taste, you
will forbid nothing, you will not be forbidden, you will rise above and
sink below, you will be among the direction of wounded and suffering. now
you will do this for a long time, for aeons.

now you will embrace emptiness, you are making sheave-other, you are
making sheave-emptiness, you are making wrath, are making creation, are
making annihilation. now you are making annihilation, now you are among
them, beneath them, above them, now you are beyond them. now you are no
longer imagining, you are no longer thinking among them, you are no longer
thinking, no longer sheave, no longer thought, now you are annihilation,
now you are making nothing, now you are annihilation, now you destroy
house and world and word, now you are destroyed, now you are annihilation,
you are free, you are emptiness, you are annihilation, you are emptiness,
now you are free.

Dear all
READ THIS CAREFULLY FOR A GUARANTEED CHUCKLE. I, FOR ONE, ALMOST FELL OFF
MY CHAIR.

Writing of the lack of positive 'dogmas' surrounding much modern poetry he
claims that:
'The result is a certain lack of positive satisfaction in the reading of
any poetry; doubt becomes a permanent back-ground of the mind, both as to
whether the thing is being interpreted rightly and as to whether, if it is,
one ought to allow one elf to feel pleased.'

    From Seven types of Ambiguity, (London: Pimlico, 2004), p.255

At least the elf will be pleased with its reading.

Hello,

Vocalese can provide an interesting alternative to traditional singing in opera.  I'm thinking specifically of the opera "Astronome" by John Zorn which incorporates all manner of vocal sounds, utterances & strangeness.  Rather than detracting from the emotional impact of the piece, these pre-verbal noises actually open up new avenues for hearing and interpretation.

I'd make the same argument for the use of these 'out of bounds' noises in poetry.

Best,

Too bad the fools in the CIA don't have a MOST LISTENED TO list. Why "watch" Marley? What a sad waste of time. I can understand your fatigue concerning the use & misuse of the Marley name. This, too, I understand: To retract or redact:  I'm tired of the "Legend" idea of compilation and
offering, of re-release and remasterings, of appropriation by surf
communities everywhere, and not of the person that Marley was.

I agree with Mairead that there seem to be levels of meaning in

Ryan Daley <rcdaley@GMAIL.COM> wrote: My comment about Marley and Dylan notwithstanding, I must admit that I was a
huge fan of both, and an even more avid fan of the former (my undergraduate
entrance essay was written as a paean to Marley. So, needless to say, I was
more than a huge Marley fan. I think it's very sad that his legacy left
behind so much infighting and trading on his name. That being said, I think
Marley was much more heroic than Dylan. Think about the December 1976
assassination attempt on his life (A  ruling party behind it, supposedly
because Marley was gaining such mass appeal that he represented a threat).
Think about the fact that he was on the CIA's "Most Watched List," probably
sharing space with Allende. Marley is so much more than a musician....he's a
Fred Hampton, a Dylan, a Kind David all rolled into one, 5' 3" persona.
Really a beautiful person.

Marley's
music. Just "Mr. Brown" alone is a beautiful piece about a crow that used to
ride around town on the coffin during funerals...really weird stuff. "Mortal
the downpressor, he'll lead the life of sad tomorrow..." A cutting, almost
Biblical attempt at the universal in both its embrace of inherent violence
of life (hexes, death, duppies, etc.) and the need to rise up and confront
those doing the "downpressing."

Giles Goodland: "...this is one of the best works of poetry I have seen
for many years."
<http://stridemagazine.co.uk/Stride%20mag%202007/Nov%202007/mix%20revs.htm>

Alan Sondheim: "This is the first 21st century classic."

Jerome Rothenberg: "/Rhode Island Notebook/ is a modern/postmodern epic
as a poem including everything. An incredibly human/humane book at
bottom...."

Mathias Svalina: "This is such a barn burner."

Ray Bianchi: "Gudding...bring[s] us a great book and one that needs to
be read for the work that it is."

Anthony Robinson: "I'm pretty blown away by how messy, heartbreaking,
and absolutely essential each line is.... Do you know how long it's been
since I've read something that's made me feel like that?"

Uncomplicatedly: "Gudding’s /Notebook/ is much more like mind as I know
it — full of nonsense, full of noise, easily distracted, self-obsessed,
but occasionally brilliant. It is, in many ways, a relief."

no doubt, but they got better. they were an infant ensemble when you saw them.
but they became a singular sound, an innovative sound. William Burroughs started to hang with them. Everyone knew they were boss. the drummer was excellent. & Page, while no better than many other 1st tier rock guitarist on the electric, had a really nice acoustical touch. a touch that other rock guitarist didn't bother to explore.

OK -- but compared to the likes of Buddy Guy and Johnny WInter, just OK --

It's a great book, Gabriel. My housemate Ryan and I are both reading it, and we're moved and amused. Ryan said, "the book just seems right somehow;" it's certainly appeared at a good time for me.
Thanks for writing it.

cheers,

Andy

*These suggestions are all right as far as they go.  "Repeat a lot"
doesn't have to be a big part of it, though.  The composer can pick and
choose what tastily-written phrases to repeat; just provide some
tastily-written ones to use.  Remember that guttural G's are tough to
repeat and they tend to take the voice back into the throat, which makes
it hard to keep a smooth line to the singing ( i.e., keep the sound "up
front" and "in the mask"). Also, the short "a" (as in "as") is a bitch to
keep resonant, so try not to give a lot of important words--which will
need to be held longer than other words--a lot of short "a" vowels.  You
can fudge better with the short "u" as in "us".  *

* The stuff on exposition is not necessarily true, if the composer is good
at writing music for "recitative" as well as "aria".  I think a better
thing for the librettist to consider would be to write with fairly clear
differentiation between what is "recitative" (dialogue, discussion, plot
propulsion) writing and what is "aria" (stop-action for reflection,
revelation, arrival at decision--i.e., emotional persuasion, recognition
and release).  Listen to/read libretti of Wagner for an almost complete
lack of differentiation between the two (Wagner megalomaniacally
considered everything he wrote as revelation, and he was his own
librettist--a 19th Cent. pathology)--most of Wagner is recitative
declamation slowed to the tempo of aria; listen to Mozart--esp. Le Nozze
di Figaro--for a complete balance between the two; listen to/read libretti
of Monteverdi's work for an almost complete lack of aria--the bulk of
Monteverdi (very early opera) is recitative declamation of poetry with
thin musical accompaniment (lute, one or two bass instruments, like the
later Mozartean recitativo secco)...so the poetry is directly accessible.
Listen to /read libretti of Puccini (he didn't write his own) for a late
19th-Cent. take on excellent balance between "recitative" and "aria"--his
recitative is songlike but the plot advances well and rapidly.  Listen
to/read Four Saints in Three Acts by Virgil Thomson (libretto by Gertrude
Stein) for a singsong/20th Cent. popsong approach to libretto craft.
Listen to Candide for Bernstein's jazzy approach to neoclassical (the
novel by Voltaire) operatic writing (pretty brilliant)... * * I guess it
would be best to familiarize yourself with your composer's characteristic
style(s) of both instrumental and vocal music, so the rhythm of your words
in the characters' mouths will better magnetize themselves to your
composer's music while you are creating those words, rather than as an
afterthought.  Like any poet--even if you aren't and are "just" a
playwright--your words should be delicious to the composer and singers to
say out loud in some way, and not just fine words.* ** *

Hope this is helpful and not confusing.  Best I can do.*

You may consider Wagner a megalomaniac, if you like.  But he wrote the greatest operas.  Most opera composers need librettists, however.  I suppose that is a good thing for poets.  Having never written one, although I'd love to be asked to do so, I can't really say.  Regards, Tom Savage

Jones attended the concert. He explains his passion for Zeppelin in the current issue of the New Yorker.

In the Days of My Youth                 While at the Led Zeppelin reunion concert, which I write about in this week’s column, I tried to guess at the median age of the crowd. I arrived, unscientifically and with the help of an English journalist, at fifty-five, with a smattering of twenty- or thirty-somethings and very few older than sixty. In terms of gender, the boys won hands down. I did see Pink running up and down the stairs, her hair and outfit all black. I did not see Michael J. Fox, however.
 The 02 Arena, built in 1999 to house the Millennium Experience, was supposedly designed for musical performances, but I don’t think much can be done with an enormous box that seats twenty-two thousand people. (If Zeppelin does decide to tour, let’s hope it does some secret small night-club gigs.) The venue fare, however, is above average in terms of beer—Boddingtons on tap—and you can get malt vinegar for your chips. (Please deposit refuse in the appropriate bin.) The surrounding 02 complex looks like a science museum that’s been eaten by a mini-mall. The giant holographic snowflakes might be seasonal; the big blue light globes are probably permanent. The names of the restaurants and shops are different from those of their American counterparts, and at least one night club on the premises—Urban Inc.—is a bit swankier than anything you’d find in an American mall or megavenue.
 It was there that the Zeppelin after-party was held, or at least the one hosted by the Warner Music Group. On the way to the party, I passed a fifty-something man wearing a red-and-white knit sweater bearing the ZOSO logo. I asked him where he’d got it. “Me mum, seventy-five,” he yelled, and it wasn’t clear whether he was talking about her age, the year she had knit it for him, or both.
 At the after-party, the biggest names I saw were Mark Ronson, the record producer and celebrity d.j.; Craig Kallman, the Atlantic Records executive; and Lyor Cohen, an executive at the Warner Music Group. The d.j. was spinning Atlantic hits from the past—Aretha Franklin, Rufus Thomas—and the walls were lined with posters for “Mothership,” the new Led Zeppelin greatest-hits compilation. Ahmet Ertegun may be gone and Zeppelin may have changed, but the catalogue remains the same.
 At the airport, on the way home, I stopped to buy the new album by England’s greatest band: Girls Aloud. (Oh, stop. The Beatles broke up.) I asked the clerk what was selling.
 “That Winehouse, still—loads of it,” he said. “Brilliant album.” (As with Britney in America, bad personal press cannot seem to keep a good record down.)
 What else?
 “Zeppelin—all of it. The greatest hits, the live one, all the old ones. Must have something to do with the show.”
 Might do.

Touching Time: Bodies/Writing/Histories. A practice-based research symposiu=
m

April 19th/20th, 2008 Dance Building, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor

Keynote Provocation: Ann Cooper Albright, Professor of Dance, Oberlin Colle=
ge

Conference Team: Amy Carroll, Assistant Professor of English and
American Culture (Latina/o Studies)
Amy Chavasse, Assistant Professor of Dance
Petra Kuppers, Associate Professor of English (Performance
Studies/Disability Studies)
Yopie Prins, Associate Professor of Comparative Literature

In 2007, the University of Michigan hosted the Anarcha Project
symposium: a large-scale event where black culture and disability
culture activists, medical historians and performance scholars came
together to approach a particular medical historical case-study through
performance means. In 2008, we want to build on the methods explored in
the Anarcha, and invite scholars and artists to engage in experimental
historical writing and art practice.

We invite up to twenty participants (grad students, faculty, artists)
to come together for two days, to workshop, use performances and
presentations as provocations, and explore methods of merging art
practice and critical writing in the exploration of time. The
historical topics we will explore are open, and will be determined by
applicants=92 interests. The symposium=92s main focus is with innovative
methodologies, writing-as-practice, archival embodiment, timespace
poetics, repronarrativities, heirlooms/legacies, frottages with
his(hiss)/her-stories, myth movement, touching textures. We will be in
research practice together: this is not a conference to share the
results of previous research. Thus, we are not looking for papers, we
are looking for participants in this experiment.

Each invitee will have transport and accommodation costs reimbursed up
to $300 dollars. The conference hotel offers rooms for about sixty
dollars a night, and we will assist people who want to be hosted by
graduate students.

Application Process: please send us a short CV, a sample of your
writing (experimental, performative or traditional critical), and a
brief statement about why you would like to participate.

Alternatively, send a DVD or CD with performance or visual arts
material, also accompanied by a statement. Send all materials to the
symposium director: Petra Kuppers, petra@umich.edu, or to the snail
mail address: Petra Kuppers, English Department, 3216 Angell Hall,
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1003

Deadline: January 1st. Notification: January 15th.

Opera as an artform is the most likely to make me giggle uncontrollably, or
go to sleep. (Even the worst plays don't send me to sleep). But it's also
provided me with some great moments in the theatre. My problem is that I
prefer it to be theatre, rather than a concert with expensive costumes. On
the whole, I prefer chamber opera.

Tom: I agree about Wagner. His operas are a long way from just a
concert with expensive costumes. But it's absolutely necessary to
follow the libretto, at least the first time. Being a megalomaniac
isn't exactly a disqualification in the arts. Wagner's among the best
of the 19th Century.

Alison: Do you feel the same about Mozart? Moussorgsky?

hi poetics friends....i encourage those coming to
chicago for the mla to check out the big jasper johns
show at the art institute.  besides johns' own
interesting use of text, you can see the poetry/art
influence as johns refrences frank o'hara, ted
berrigan, and hart crane.

the chicago show is running through january 6th.  or,
if you're nyc folk, this show will be at the
metropolitan museum of art from february 5 – may 4.

onwards,
jennifer karmin

As one of the most acclaimed and influential living
artists, Jasper Johns has been the subject of numerous
exhibitions, many of which have explored his signature
use of flags, numbers, and other emblems. This
exhibition emerges from broader studies of Johns's
approach to form, examining for the first time the
artist's use of gray in his paintings, sculptures,
prints, and drawings from 1955 to the present.
Featuring more than 130 works and including major new
works that have never been exhibited publicly, the
exhibition tracks Johns's application of gray for more
than five decades—an investigation that provides a
framework for understanding the development of the
artist's entire oeuvre.

I can second here, having seen the show about
a year back in Cleveland.

and, after seeing it, began to delve deeply into
his published notebooks, seeing many references
also to Pound--directly and indirectly.

And, I could clearly see Ronald Johnson's
interest in his work, production techniques.

Hi Jennifer and Everybody,=20

I just checkout out the Art Institute of Chicago site. If you're going to M=
LA (and arriving on Thursday), you can see the exhibit (which is usually 12=
 clams!) for FREE from 5-8 pm (compliments of everyone's favorite discount =
retailer, Target). Even if you're not into Jasper Johns, the museum's colle=
ction is great. Be sure not to miss the Julian Opie mural in the museum's c=
afe.=20

See y'all there,=20

I was talking about productions, rather than the operas themselves. Opera is
after all a performing art. I've seen gorgeous productions of Mozart (whom I
particularly love) - a very memorable and enchanting one of The Magic Flute,
for instance - and ones that sent me to sleep, like a recent Don Giovanni.
One of the loveliest things I've ever seen was a production by William
Kentridge (an artist I really love) of Monteverdi's The Return of Ulysses.
And a Rake's Progress with a David Hockney set was also a beautiful thing.

And yes, I'm afraid waves of sleep have overcome me in Wagner. All that lush
music is fatal, and if there's nothing happening on stage except large
people showing off their good posture and singing amid an overbearing set,
then, well, that's the end of me... Even Robert Wilson at his worst can be a
whole lot of colour and movement and nothing else, though I admit it's very
spectacular colour and movement. But that's just me.

As I said, I think the opera world is weird. But that doesn't mean that in
theory I don't think it's a good idea. I've always been rather taken with
Wagner's idea of total theatre.

Subject:      Derivation of "Bug," telegraphy code, etc.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Derivation of "Bug," telegraphy code, etc.


"Bug" has been traced vis-a-vis computer folklore to early programming/
hardware/software/etc. as far back as the 1950s I believe. But recently
I've come across a much earlier source. In The Telegraph Instructor, 4th
and revised edition, 1908, G.M. Dodge gives a list of telegraph terms.

"Bug-in-the-wire -- A slang phrase frequently used when a wire is in
trouble."

This relates to "buggy," "he's bugged," "stop bugging me," and so forth;
what's interesting is the noun related to communications technology. In
relation to computers, this might be a case of convergent evolution, but
it's more likely to have moved through telegraphy - telephony - radio -
and so forth, into the habitus of information theory and cybernetics.

Another early term relates to the origins of "ham" in "ham radio" -
although the exact source of this remains unknown:

"'Ham' or 'Plug' -- A telegraph operator, who is not proficient."

[A number of phrases we take for granted are older than they appear. For
example, "so long"; from A. Wallace, Popular Sayings Dissected, 1895: "So
long! a leave-taking, a piece of colonial terseness is equivalent to 'au
revoir, saluons!' of which latter word it may be a direct corruption, or
again of 'salaam,' a bow, or 'salem,' 'peace be with you.' The phrase may
be paraphrased into 'Goodbye, so long as we do not meet.'"]

On another related topic, early Morse code was somewhat different; there
were all sorts of variations - Navy Codes, European Codes, Morse American
codes, etc. The same book gives for example, "The Morse code of signals as
applied to the telegraph is used exclusively in the United States." The
code as given has three dash-lengths; for example,

t is -
but
l is --
and
0 is ----
In addition,
c is .. .
that is, some letters have small breaks within them; while
i is ..
o is . .
and
y is .. ..
and Further, there are some longer strings; ending parentheses
) is .....  .. ..
and
capitalized letters are indicated by .. . .-..
- so it goes. (Oddly this has been difficult to type, since I wanted to
eliminate meta/diacritical marks which might have been taken as part of
the code itself!)

The actual telegraph (semantic) code on top of the Morse results in
messages such as

Wr r ty gg r 9
or
Es r ty cn
and addresses/headers can read as obscurely as
Hr tru pink No 38 VO HW "HX" ck 12 collect N P R

The code, like international signals codes, is heuristic, ideographic, and
was simply memorized by the telegraph operator. It was just as complicated
for railroad telegraphy, where the difference between 19 and 31 - both
meaning "train order" - was complex.

Note that this is triple-coding - Morse to telegraphic code to ordinary
language, and that, while natural language is fond of redundancy (re:
Shannon/Weaver), telegraphy is dominated by economic considerations.
Thus word counts, and what constitutes a word, are critical. For example:

Van Dorne - 1 word
Queen Anne County - 3 words
44.12 - 5 words
No. 185 22nd St - 8 words
North Carolina - 1 word
10 000 000 - 8 words
and so forth.

The telegraph operator also had to understand railroad Engine Steam
Whistle Signals; here are a few (o - short sound and --- long sound):

o Stop. Apply breaks.
--- --- Release Breaks.
--- o o o Flagman go back and protect rear of train.
--- --- --- --- Flagman return from west or south.
--- --- --- --- --- Flagman return from east or north.
--- --- --- When running, train parted; to be repeated until answered.
o o Answer to any signal not otherwise provided for.
--- --- o o Approaching public crossings at grade.
o o o o Call for signals.

Air whistles are different, as are torpedo signals, light signals,
semaphore, etc.

Service Message Code:

N S N - No such number.
G B A - Give better address.
G S A - Give some address.
DFS - Disregard former service.
92 - Deliver.
Deld (or) 92d - Delivered.

There is also Phillips Press Code - an example:

"A dsx rain es wind storm psd tru t nt end o ta county tsm dsyg a gt deal
o prpy, roofs wr bln off a no o sma blgs es nux trees wr uprtd. A barn
blng to James Sampson ws stru by lghtg kig 3 horses es burng svl tons o
hay stored trin." This is standardized, but formed, it seems, primarily by
the elimination of redundancy. The header for the same example, however,
is another thing:

"o
Hr tru No 39 VO HW "HX" ck 63 collect N P R"
and so forth.

If the late Jean Baudrillard had managed to be coaxed into writing a piece about Hillary Clinton, it'd probably sound like


Hillary Clinton has never existed. There is no point dreaming about a "real" Hillary Clinton, a hidden Hillary Clinton, an ideal socialist: this just hypostatizes a simulacrum. If Hillary Clinton is a simulation, the only likely turn of events is that of a brutal de-simulation, the social ceasing to take itself as a space of reference and to play the game, and putting an end at last to power, the effect of power and to the mirror of the social which perpetuates it. A desimulation which itself captures the style of a challenge...

& so on...in the manner of Baudrillard's more effusive, bombastic style, a sort of bad writing contest... who can do the most pretentious Baudrillard?

Hi All --

A side project including one of the super cool gurus at 37signals.com is
http://commandshift3.com -- on which you can click "hot or not" websites.
They're using some kind of Gen XYY reverse psychology to do something with
the results, I would guess, tho it seems a great place to get on-the-spot
impressions & design ideas. Anyhow, Listenlight Poetry in the "journal" tag
category is, atm, beating The Wall Street Journal and Live Journal.  Totally
different demographics, of course, but here we have it.  As well, the key
trends are up since issue 06 (when we first got hit hard), I would estimate
somewhere between 33 and 45 per cent since "version 2.0" issue 12.

here's a screen capture of LL progress on the site after "22 battles" --
http://listenlight.net/media/listenlight_cmdshft3-122207.jpg (~150K)

Many deepest thanks Stephen, Peter and Jim for your responses; they quite
stunned me.  I apologize the delay in responding.  Wrote most of it and then
interrupted for days before chance to "end it all."
     For some time, re language, i've been very interested in forgeries,
plagiarisms, disinformation, pseudo- and anonymities, distranslations,
propaganda, the combinings and recombinings of these and the ways these are
used by governments, organizations, criminals and writers of everything from
travel literature to history, fiction, textbooks and poetry.  Paranoiac and
conspiratorial manifestations of language, the hallucinations of lexicons,
the detritus of cast off "figures of speech," anachronisms, nostrums, the
junkyards of terminologies surpassed--all this is not simply raw material
for use, but also i think contains much of use in examining and thinking
with  writing and reading.  The bottom line  is really
"belief"--credere--which shares a root with "credit."
      "Did you buy her story?"  As in believe it--and/or purchase it. "So
and-so says--" "how much is  his word worth?"  "How much stock do you put in
that line of reasoning, of poetry?"
"  "I wouldn't give a wooden nickel for his opinion."  "The New Sentence is
more valuable as a tool than the old."  "The liberating value of these poems
is not to be measured in the counting of their syllabic units."
"Ironically, the unique flaws of the  forgery proved more valuable than its
mundane original." "In the market of ideas, he's not much more than a
thief."  "Is there more value to those vast acres if Nature is a construct
of language or if it is not?"

The idea of an, unmediated, immediate apprehension/communication obsessed me
a as child, and, later, learning it was a kind of a "dream," a "Utopian
yearning," found through human history,  it still remains  a fascinating
question, and one which finds its companion so to speak in desire, when
intercourse as "conversation" turns to intercourse as "consummation."

    Persons like Ted Serios, who could "project" an image from his mind
directly on/into  photographic image seemed a "step in the right direction,"
however flawed it might be.  (And was.)  Though i still like to look at
those strange images he projected from his mind--not to mention the
incredible amount of work it took to come up with what were claimed to be
the "original" images--or ones certainly seeming as if they could be.
Images which--well, where did they come from, as places he had never been?
       Judging from the low-fi quality of the Serios images--dim, jerky,
faraway-- perhaps they came from street found newspapers, limmed with dirt,
sun-yellowed or rain-blurred, or library reading room encyclopedias, their
images  thick with the oily patinas of hundreds of dubiously sanitary
fingerprints, or random but "startling" things found in the trash . . .
        The image files of the brain as a vast rubbish heap, like those
ancient Egyptian city dumps in which the ratty recycled  papyri of
"expendable mummies" rattle in dry winds among feral cats, bearing the
verses of Sappho . . .

   It's often interesting to take statements and reverse them, asking--whom
would this benefit?  For example:  nature is a construction.  One could
examine this in terms of in what ways and for whom it is a benefit to
think/believe this.
   One might also say:  is this not the same sign of hubris which placed
humans at the center of the universe?  That it is "constructed" by "us"?
One could posit it instead as:  humans are a construction of nature.  Or:
construction is human nature.

     There is a sign often found in offices, a chilling reminder:  "If it's
not in writing, it never happened."
      One could reverse this and say, "If it's in writing, it never
happened."

        Again, one thinks--who benefits?

         I.E.--who is it "good" for?  The "common good"--a sort of play on
the Socratic good Jim writes of?  (Something which is a "good" common in all
cases.)  As in Orwell's Animal Farm, "good" usually winds up like
"equality":  "All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others."

         Baudelaire wrote of language as a forest of symbols (the birth of
Symbolism) and from there evolved his theory of Correspondances. Baudelaire
also grasped right away who the telegraph would be "good" for:  in his
notebooks he writes that for stock market traders and bankers, whoever has
the most immediate access to the fastest information will have the "inside
edge" so to speak of the "insider trader."  For the poet, the telegraph is
already the "information highway" of the "robber barons."  And, though
that's an American term, one of those Baudelaire mentions did have a "real"
baron-connection:  M. de Rothchild.  This could be thought of a
"trans-continental," trans-lingual" "correspondance" of "(robber)
Barons"--the globalization of the new "Nobility" (a play itself on
the"noble" as a version of the "good") manifested in the penchant of the
Biggest Robbers for the Biggest Philanthropy, to further emphasize  that,
indeed, some truly are "more" "Noble" than others.

         Emerson's "Nature" is an extraordinary essay.  In trying to find
what will enable the citizens of the young United States to establish their
own "Original relation with the Universe,"
Emerson chooses not things human-made (mostly as yet derived from forms from
elsewhere), but (American)  Nature.  To Paraphrase:  The blank and ruin we
see in Nature is in our own eye.

 It is because the American eye is as yet too set on seeing-as-projecting
other values, from the past, from other cultures, as a grid of comparisons
in which an American Nature is found "wanting," that what IS there is
unseen. (The anti-Transcendental Poe finds this as "The Purloined Letter.")
A "virtual" reality of non-American vision misses what is hidden in plain
site/sight/cite so to speak.  For Emerson, the figure of "The Poet" is the
one who will help lead the way to the finding of this "original relation to
the Universe" via an "original" Nature.  And that Poet he at first thought
had appeared, almost as though he had been summoned,  in the quasi-anonymous
author of "Leaves of Grass."

   Emerson was writing just at the cusp of some older American Wonders
becoming Tourist Sites (Niagara Falls, The Old Man of the Mountain, etc) and
the movements West to the truly Grand Canyonesque, Mississippi sized
Wonders, the Paul Bunyanesque Giganticism of Sequoias, Great Lakes, the
Rockies, not to mention Texas, the Pacific Sublime, Volcanos, Tornados,
Massacres, Buffalo- Herds,---the Natural examples for such behemoths as
Standard Oil, Transcontinental Railroads, Empire State Building, and poetic
Giganticisms such as Whitman',s Pound's and Olson's, Williams' Paterson and
the Long Poems recently discussed here
   The lack of "picturesque ruins, ancient buildings, Old Masters," is more
than made up for by the sheer Gigantic Grandeur of American Nature, from
which will emerge a new vision of the Sublime.  (Think of the Giganticism of
American painting, sculpture, Hollywood, the Great American Novel---)

         Emerson's famous letter to Whitman on first reading Leaves, after
having found out who and where the Poet was, Whitman quickly took advantage
of to publicize his basically self-published book length song of "Myself."
(Self publishing and vanity publishing having something in common so to
speak.)
      In effect, Whitman "seized the day" and "replaced" Nature with himself
as Kosmos and the USA as "the Greatest Poem" which fills the American space
formerly seen as a blank and ruin.  "SPACE," after all still being for Olson
a century stll later the "central fact" of America.  For Olson Whitman  is
replaced by Melville & Moby Dick, then Maximus, with Creeley as "Figure of
Outward."

      The other side of this appetite for the Super Sized  (think
Steroid-Sized Superstars, the new Paul Bunyans,) is the the Minimal--Poe's
theory of the short story, the short poem and Emily Dickinson's creation of
universes within the ever shifting minutia of handwriting, the subtly or
dramatically  changing punctuation marks, dashes, the handmade small folded
books hidden in drawers--
         Which with Robert Smithson returns  as a "Spiral Jetty" bringing
one back out into Earth Works--the meeting places of the immensely small and
the immensely large, the wastelands of technology as ruins and deserts as
blanks, "where remote pasts meet remote futures" and-where the re-cycling of
Earth Works is "Nature" re-found as Ecology.

      Thoreau, who "traveled much in Concord," foresaw this:  "In wildness
is the preservation of the world."  The "wildness" he finds is very
interesting--the Spiral Jetty recycling of the omnipresent Greek and Roman
Classics into his self-built shelves!!  In a way very Voltairean, like
Candide, Thoreau's  "cultivating his own garden" at Walden Pond and
supplementing his beans with Seneca, Socrates and others.
        Hawthorne, who also grew his own vegetables and collected nuts and
berries while living as a neighbor of Melville's--used to read the
Transcendentalists' journal The' Dial for its excellence as a soporific.
Nothing to induce a nap in an allegorist like Hawthorne than the turning of
the world into a symbol of spirit!
         Poe, who hated Boston as the place of both his birth and his
mother's death, called the Transcendendalists the "Frog-Pondians."

        ( Desire is Poe's work is repetitively that for a beautiful dying
woman, poised between life and death--then dying- -followed by poet's
"after effects" existence of "Mournful and Never-Ending Remembrance"-----his
"most poetical" of themes as described in "Philosophy of Composition"----not
to mention his marrying his 13 or 14  year old cousin and watching her
slowly die of "Consumption," as years earlier he had watched his brother die
of the same disease in a tiny attic in Baltimore.

            The latest rage in Poe's day was the construction of
cemeteries--Mt Auburn on the boundary of Cambridge and Watertown, MA is the
template--as simultaneously places of "Mournful & Never-Ending Remembrance,"
and the health giving effects of walking in a vast arboretum of native and
imported trees, flowers, types of stone and art work as "figured" in
statues, vaults' engravings,and the decorative expressionisms of metal
designs in the small fences around separate plots.  Ornate benches in many
materials distributed along curving and sloping walkways gave the
opportunity for contemplation of Eternity as well as of the Transient
Beauties of Nature.  The "uplift" of "Moral Suasion" and Good Air and
Walking --again, the "good," the "virtuous"--all supposed to confer upon the
citizen a desire to move from the cramped city to the suburbs beckoning just
the other side of the vast park-like Cemetery.  And this, indeed, is what
happened.

          It was not only the living who had to be encouraged to move--there
was simply no more room left in Boston's ancient, overcrowded cemeteries,
and the dead, too, had to find "a new place to live," "room to breathe."
With  all that  "retirement"  "time on their hands," why not install a phone
to keep up with the gossip back in "dear old Boston" and at the Christian
Science Monitor offices and buildings?
            Some decades after the cemetery's founding,  Mary Baker Eddy did
just this when she willed that a telephone be installed along with her body
in the Vault she had prepared. After all, this new means of "speaking at a
distance." might well include the "long distance" of what Raymond Chandler
called "The Big Sleep."


         The gateway to Eternity--and the gateway to Suburbia!!  And passing
from one to the other via the statued and tree shaded walkways of the
outdoor gallery of  the Art of Nature and that of human hands.
           And, by virtue of the virtual telephonic voice, the Eternal dead
and the Suburban living carrying on intimate intercourse across the
"emptiness of these vast spaces" that so frightened Pascal.
           One wonders if Poe's efforts to "keep in touch" with the
"beautiful dying women" who pass into the "Mournful never-Ending
Remembrance" of the Raven's squawking "Nevermore!" might then be resolved
via the intimate intercourse of phone sex!
            The virtual as not simply "Spirit" and spirituality--but the
contacting of spirits--and the making "virtuous" of Necrophilia.
               From Table-tapping to Wire Tapping!!!!

             Big Brother
              Was a mother-
                But Uncle Sam
                  Is a Dirty Old Man!

Steve,

Can anyone but Baudrillard win this contest?

It is exactly this kind of mumbo jumbo -an example of it being that Gore is

Baudrillard was especially silly when he spoke of Africans. It was as though he had never seen a black person before. Imagine Jimmy the Greek if he had read a few books. Although I sometimes enjoyed Baudrillard and regarded him as a nihilistic Marshall Mcluhan, at his worst, he lapsed into self-parody.

David,


I now live across the street from the Westford cemetery in Connecticut whic=
h
I imagine was pre-"Mournful & Never-Ending Remembrance," lacking the
arboreal trappings but ripe for your rubBEings described by Geoff Huth as
"raucous" and "muddy frottages". This particular
morning<http://cgi7.com/peterimages/graves.jpg>(see attached) bright
and crisp, with ice and snow.
I began to notice my language when confronted by these stark objects =96
slate, granite, incised, chiseled rectangular, lichen, trying to linger in
the pure experience of vision as long as I could before my language took
over. Graves, tombstones, frost, and then the names =96 "Polly", "James",
"Abigail=85"

 Martin Heidegger noted this "first time":
"Language, by naming beings for the first time, first brings beings to word
and to appearance." And he continues; " Only this naming nominates beings t=
o
their being from out of their being."

 As you said " Again, one thinks--who benefits?"

 How exactly does language grab the object from the blur and bring it into
being? At what point does the brain deconstruct the cemetery into the
objects that populate it? As Peter Schwenger says in *"The tears of things"=
:
* "The death of the thing then, is the price we pay for the word."

 The poetry in your process appears to be the salvaging of discarded
language, reprocessing, recycling the useless by bringing it into being
again. When I photograph the headstones carvings and other bits of found
text and reparse in 3-D worlds, the reparse points reflect the original
contexts and indicate the locations and meanings from which the external
information has be taken. The act of layering, of montage, represents the
function of time as in the moving from one bit of dissociate text to
another.

Baudrillard was also very ugly when he spoke of the differently-abled,  those
with serious physical infirmities.

But then they were, like everything to him apparently, convenient metaphors
to be deployed in a particularly ugly argument (I am thinking of one of his
semiotexte books).

I thought the poem was really cool, by the way....
No, I was referring to the web craze second life, as it's been a topic of
conversation with many of my friends lately, especially as I know several
people with loved ones who spend more time in their "second life" than their
first.  I also have a friend who showed the site to me.  He uses it quite a
lot, too.

I found translations of a couple of his novels in google books but I
haven't been able to pull up any poetry in translation.  From what I
read calling him a surrealist & comparing him to Breton is a bit of a
stretch.  Anybody know of a link or two?

French President Nicolas Sarkozy mourns his loss. It's doubtful that an American politician would recognize the name.

                        His death was confirmed by Neweduk Funeral Home in Mississauga, the Toronto suburb where Peterson lived. The city's mayor, Hazel McCallion, told The Associated Press that he died of kidney failure but that she did not know when. The hospital and police refused to comment. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported that he died on Sunday.
 "He's been going downhill in the last few months, slowing up," McCallion said, calling Peterson a "very close friend."
 During an illustrious career spanning seven decades, Peterson played with some of the biggest names in jazz, including Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie. He is also remembered for touring in a trio with Ray Brown on bass and Herb Ellis on guitar in the 1950s.
 Peterson's impressive collection of awards include all of Canada's highest honors, such as the Order of Canada, as well as a Lifetime Grammy (1997) and a spot in the International Jazz Hall of Fame.
 His growing stature was reflected in the admiration of his peers. Duke Ellington referred to him as "Maharajah of the keyboard," while Count Basie once said "Oscar Peterson plays the best ivory box I've ever heard."
 In a statement, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said "one of the bright lights of jazz has gone out."
 "He was a regular on the French stage, where the public adored his luminous style," Sarkozy said. "It is a great loss for us."
 Jazz pianist Marian McPartland called Peterson "the finest technician that I have seen."
 McPartland said she first met Peterson when she and her husband, jazz cornetist Jimmy McPartland, opened for him at the Colonial Tavern in Toronto in the 1940s.
 "From that point on we became such goods friends, and he was always wonderful to me and I have always felt very close to him," she said. "I played at his tribute concert at Carnegie Hall earlier this year and performed `Tenderly,' which was always my favorite piece of his."
 The American jazz pianist Billy Taylor called Peterson one of the finest jazz pianists of his time.
 "He set the pace for just about everybody that followed him. He really was just a special player," Taylor said.
 Born on Aug. 15, 1925, in a poor neighborhood southwest of Montreal, Peterson obtained a passion for music from his father. Daniel Peterson, a railway porter and self-taught musician, bestowed his love of music to his five children, offering them a means to escape from poverty.
 Oscar Peterson learned to play trumpet and piano at a young age, but after a bout with tuberculosis had to concentrate on the latter.
 He became a teen sensation in his native Canada, playing in dance bands and recording in the late 1930s and early 1940s. But he got his real break as a surprise guest at Carnegie Hall in 1949, after which he began touring the United States and Europe.
 He quickly made a name for himself as a jazz virtuoso, often compared to piano great Art Tatum, his childhood idol, for his speed and technical skill.
 He was also influenced by Nat King Cole, whose Nat King Cole Trio album he considered "a complete musical thesaurus for any aspiring Jazz pianist."
 Peterson never stopped calling Canada home despite his growing international reputation. But at times he felt slighted here, where he was occasionally mistaken for a football player, standing at 6 foot 3 and more than 250 pounds.
In 2005 he became the first living person other than a reigning monarch to obtain a commemorative stamp in Canada, where he is jazz royalty, with streets, squares, concert halls and schools named after him.
Peterson suffered a stroke in 1993 that weakened his left hand, but not his passion or drive for music. Within a year he was back on tour, recording "Side By Side" with Itzhak Perlman.
 As he grew older, Peterson kept playing and touring, despite worsening arthritis and difficulties walking.
"A jazz player is an instant composer," Peterson once said in a CBC interview, while conceding jazz did not have the mass appeal of other musical genres. "You have to think about it, it's an intellectual form," he said.

Very nice work, Mr. V.?Was all the red and green for Xmas? (j/k). I thought it was very brave of you to bare it all at 1:02 in this video. That was the best Christmas streaking I've seen all day. Of course it is a little cold here today. Bravissimo.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

A truly idiotic op ed piece in the Times by Slavoj Zizek, about the
European Union's anthem, Beethoven's setting of Schiller's An die
Freude--Ode to Joy. Somebody ought to tell him that the poem was
written as An die Freiheit--Ode to Freedom--as Beethoven and
everybody else at the time knew (one assumes the folks in Brussels
are aware, as well), and the censors made him change it. Through some
very questionable musicology, Zizek turns the setting into an appeal
for the admission of Turkey to the EU. Really.

Hi David,

Although I think that many assignations of what is 'natural' do not age
well, I wouldn't argue that 'nature' is whatever we say it is. That sounds
like a Bushie argument.

All the best, David, to you and to all on the Poetics list.

I have long been fascinated by Astor Piazzolla, his life and work. Here's a
great quote from him about Nadia Boulanger, one of the greatest music
teachers of the 20th Century:

*When I met her, I showed her my kilos of symphonies and sonatas. She
started to read them and suddenly came out with a horrible sentence: "It's
very well written." And stopped, with a big period, round like a soccer
ball. After a long while, she said: "Here you are like Stravinsky, like
Bart=F3k, like Ravel, but you know what happens? I can't find Piazzolla in
this." And she began to investigate my private life: what I did, what I did
and did not play, if I was single, married, or living with someone, she was
like an FBI agent! And I was very ashamed to tell her that I was a tango
musician. Finally I said, "I play in a night club." I didn't want to
say **cabaret.
And she answered, "Night club, mais oui, but that is a cabaret, isn't it?"
"Yes," I answered, and thought, "I'll hit this woman in the head with a
radio...." It wasn't easy to lie to her. She kept asking: "You say that you
are not pianist. What instrument do you play, then?" And I didn't want to
tell her that I was a bandoneon player, because I thought, "Then she will
throw me from the fourth floor." Finally, I confessed and she asked me to
play some bars of a tango of my own. She suddenly opened her eyes, took my
hand and told me: "You idiot, that's Piazzolla!" And I took all the music I
composed, ten years of my life, and sent it to hell in two seconds.

*Happy Holidays.

Thank you for this notice. I can't believe that the world will be =
without
him. On two occasions in the 1970s after concerts I had the honour and
pleasure of sitting with him and a bottle of scotch in his hotel room, =
each
time for several hours, discussing the history of jazz and listening to
anecdotes of jazz musicians. I notice that the article didn't mention
Oscar's indebtedness to Jay McShann and Count Basie as Kansas City was
definitely one of his sources.

                        His death was confirmed by Neweduk Funeral Home =
in
Mississauga, the Toronto suburb where Peterson lived. The city's mayor,
Hazel McCallion, told The Associated Press that he died of kidney =
failure
but that she did not know when. The hospital and police refused to =
comment.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported that he died on Sunday.
 "He's been going downhill in the last few months, slowing up," =
McCallion
said, calling Peterson a "very close friend."
 During an illustrious career spanning seven decades, Peterson played =
with
some of the biggest names in jazz, including Ella Fitzgerald, Count =
Basie
and Dizzy Gillespie. He is also remembered for touring in a trio with =
Ray
Brown on bass and Herb Ellis on guitar in the 1950s.
 Peterson's impressive collection of awards include all of Canada's =
highest
honors, such as the Order of Canada, as well as a Lifetime Grammy (1997) =
and
a spot in the International Jazz Hall of Fame.
 His growing stature was reflected in the admiration of his peers. Duke
Ellington referred to him as "Maharajah of the keyboard," while Count =
Basie
once said "Oscar Peterson plays the best ivory box I've ever heard."
 In a statement, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said "one of the =
bright
lights of jazz has gone out."
 "He was a regular on the French stage, where the public adored his =
luminous
style," Sarkozy said. "It is a great loss for us."
 Jazz pianist Marian McPartland called Peterson "the finest technician =
that
I have seen."
 McPartland said she first met Peterson when she and her husband, jazz
cornetist Jimmy McPartland, opened for him at the Colonial Tavern in =
Toronto
in the 1940s.
 "From that point on we became such goods friends, and he was always
wonderful to me and I have always felt very close to him," she said. "I
played at his tribute concert at Carnegie Hall earlier this year and
performed `Tenderly,' which was always my favorite piece of his."
 The American jazz pianist Billy Taylor called Peterson one of the =
finest
jazz pianists of his time.
 "He set the pace for just about everybody that followed him. He really =
was
just a special player," Taylor said.
 Born on Aug. 15, 1925, in a poor neighborhood southwest of Montreal,
Peterson obtained a passion for music from his father. Daniel Peterson, =
a
railway porter and self-taught musician, bestowed his love of music to =
his
five children, offering them a means to escape from poverty.
 Oscar Peterson learned to play trumpet and piano at a young age, but =
after
a bout with tuberculosis had to concentrate on the latter.
 He became a teen sensation in his native Canada, playing in dance bands =
and
recording in the late 1930s and early 1940s. But he got his real break =
as a
surprise guest at Carnegie Hall in 1949, after which he began touring =
the
United States and Europe.
 He quickly made a name for himself as a jazz virtuoso, often compared =
to
piano great Art Tatum, his childhood idol, for his speed and technical
skill.
 He was also influenced by Nat King Cole, whose Nat King Cole Trio album =
he
considered "a complete musical thesaurus for any aspiring Jazz pianist." =

 Peterson never stopped calling Canada home despite his growing
international reputation. But at times he felt slighted here, where he =
was
occasionally mistaken for a football player, standing at 6 foot 3 and =
more
than 250 pounds.=20
In 2005 he became the first living person other than a reigning monarch =
to
obtain a commemorative stamp in Canada, where he is jazz royalty, with
streets, squares, concert halls and schools named after him.=20
Peterson suffered a stroke in 1993 that weakened his left hand, but not =
his
passion or drive for music. Within a year he was back on tour, recording
"Side By Side" with Itzhak Perlman.=20
 As he grew older, Peterson kept playing and touring, despite worsening
arthritis and difficulties walking.=20
"A jazz player is an instant composer," Peterson once said in a CBC
interview, while conceding jazz did not have the mass appeal of other
musical genres. "You have to think about it, it's an intellectual form," =
he
said.=20

This is truly saddening. Civ and I shared a publisher, and I
published her in my magazine of the early 70s, Broadway Boogie. I
remember her as a woman in her thirties of heart-stopping loveliness.
At her birthday party, which must have been her 32nd, a man in his
twenties, in an apparent trance, walked through the rather large
crowd to where she and I were talking. "I think you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen," he blurted out. Civ was married at
the time and had a few kids. She was very gentle with him and sent
him on his way. A good poet and translator, and a generous human
being. It was at that party that I met Gregory Corso, and also two
men who became among my dearest friends, Richard Elman and Armand
Schwerner. I hope her passing was easy.

Chacun a son gout. But as to the musicology, he=20

his "analysis" of the marcia turca, maybe someone=20

I suspect that he's just being clever for the=20
sake of the essay. In any event, the anthem uses=20
only the first statement of the theme, as far as I know.

I'm content to let this rest. Those who don't think it's idiotic, fine by=

It would be nice to know what the other=20
contenders were for anthem. At least this one has no killing in it.

I agree that the NYT piece was well done.  Does anyone know if this reading
has been done before?   Beethoven's refusal to provide a comfortable restin=
g
place within the radical edges of the 9th has been used as representation o=
f
nationhood  and authoritarian order.  Doesn't the Ode itself play on this
ironic possibility in its own structure (and the potential uses of art by

and it's the first time I've been able to comprehend Zizek.

It's been interesting to find of late that Zizek is "an Op Ed Contributor"
to the NY Times.
His pieces so far have received  the response  Laura notes herself
finding------that it's amazing to find him so comprehensible.  Given the
Times' recent history, one even wonders if he is becoming an "embedded
reporter."

       I thought the timing of the piece--and of its appearance in the
Times-- very interesting.  It's "cultural" argument for the inclusion of
Turkey in the EU comes during Turkey's bombings of the rebel Kurds inside
Iraq.  Iraq is not too happy about this.  But then who listens to them?  Th=
e
bombings are openly aided and supported by the Americans who claim also to
be the Iraqi government's allies.

        It was not very long ago, remember, that the Americans and Turks
were on the verge of a big split over the issue of the Armenians.  American
lawmakers had voted to recognize Turkish actions against the Armenians
almost a century ago as a genocide.  This was unacceptable to both Turkey
and Israel.  The Americans don't want to lose their huge air bases in Turke=
y
and neither the Americans nor Israelis are very comfortable having genocide
and ethnic cleansing being in the spotlight.

       Up to now, the Kurds have been relative outsiders to the hell of
Iraq.  The last person to attack them  with a real show of force was
Saddam.  Once upon a time, the Americans loudly used what Saddam had done t=
o
the Kurds among their reasons to depose the Evil Dictator.  Now the USA is
adding Turkey in bombing the same people Saddam had.

        (Saddam had gassed the Kurds with weapons give him by the Americans
to use on Iranians during the 10 year war between Iraq and Iran.  Despite
massive efforts and support by Americans, Saddam was not able to defeat the
Islamic Republic.)

       Having reversed direction on the Armenians, the Americans now embrac=
e
the Turks more than before.  One can see where the Times publishing this
piece in the further interest of Turkey fits well with the new US policy an=
d
that of it allies Turkey and Israel.

        Previously i had forwarded to the list an October 11, 2007 Times Op
Ed by Zizek with another interesting take, in that case, re China's
outlawing of reincarnation.

         The final two paragraphs of that article, "How China Got religion"
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/11/opinion/11zizek.html?_r=3D1&th&emc=3Dth&o=
ref=3Dslogin
---
 are interesting to return to in thinking of this latest essay:

"Culture" has commonly become the name for all those things we practice
without really taking seriously. And this is why we dismiss fundamentalist
believers as "barbarians" with a "medieval mindset": they dare to take thei=
r
beliefs seriously. Today, we seem to see the ultimate threat to culture as
coming from those who live immediately in their culture, who lack the prope=
r
distance.

Perhaps we find China's reincarnation laws so outrageous not because they
are alien to our sensibility, but because they spill the secret of what we
have done for so long: respectfully tolerating what we don't take quite
seriously, and trying to contain its political consequences through the law=
.

For anyone interested, here' s a slightly earlier version of Zizek's article
with greater vibrato. More pointed and less milk-toast - you'll notice the
"fart" was edited out of the NYT rewrite, of course. The more substantial
elisions are rather gruesome in comparison, particularly the conclusion.
here's the address (you'll have to excuse the longish url, but should
copy-paste sans problem):

http://209.85.207.104/search?q=cache:scJ-btDFPRoJ:www.inthesetimes.com/article/3393/the_disturbing_sounds_of_the_turkish_march/+%22bar+331%22+beethoven&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=8&gl=us


Now I wonder, are these the only two versions of his "9th" argument?

The much I usually like Slavoj Zizek, I tend to agree with Mark Weiss on th=
e
present article. I read less his wish to have Turkey included in the
Community, rather the marginal European states like Albania and so forth
(forgive this so forth but I keep on forgetting which ones they are), still
crashed under the weight of extremely bad politics.
What I do not like in this article is his first supposition that "The Ode t=
o
Joy" is not worth being performed because:
"In 1938, it was performed as the high point of the Reichsmusiktage, the
Nazi music festival, and was later used to celebrate Hitler's birthday."
If this assumption is true or accepted, then we should banish all classical
music since the Nazis were exceptionally inclined to listening to it. Quite
a mystery, as a mystery is the fact that Hitler had an artistic inclination=
,
besides having been Wittgenstein's schoolmate. But I usually accept the
consideration that reality is weirder than fiction and as Miller did with
the Crucible, one has to change facts in order to make things more
credible for the audience.

Astor Piazzolla was very well known with the generation of his time. People
valued him like my generation did with the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. I
guess that if you like Tango, as they do in Buenos Aires, then Piazzolla is
still a very popular hero.

I shed a tear for Oscar Peterson, too, when I saw the obituary in the Times, although I don't think I ever heard him live.  Did he ever play in the Charlie Parker Festival?  If he did, then I did hear him once.  My memory of him is so strong, I must have encountered him somewhere or other in New York's very small jazz universe.  Regards, Tom Savage

David,

Having grown up in Turkey and knowing the place reasonably intimately, I ca=
n
give a more nuanced view of what is going on in Turkey and in Northern Iraq
(Kurdistan). The long held dream of the Kurds in the area is to have an
independent Kurdish state embracing the areas where the Kurds live. This
includes significant portions of Turkey, Iran, Syria and what used to be
called Iraq. In fact, the Kurdish dream runs against the national identitie=
s
of several Middle Eastern States, constituting a incipient balkanizing
force, a force for chaos. That was one of the major reasons why attacking
Iraq was such a stupid idea and why the first Bush stopped the first Iraq
war before overhrowing Hossein. In fact, I would bet that was the secret
agreement the United States had with Syria and Turkey to get them join the
coalition for the first war. My guess is that Iran does not want Iraq to
fall apart either (only an Iraq as much as possible under pro Iran/Shiite
control). If the Iraqi state completely falls apart, Iran may start having
Kurdish guerrila movements in its borders also.

The fact of a national state (especially of a bigger size) always runs
against ethnic, tribal and even cultural lines. As a result, by definition,
the idea of state involves a suppression. (Here one may have a parallel wit=
h
language where a statement, even more a given linguistic system) always
suppresses something, while revealing something. As poets, you and I are
very much after these suppressions.

We must realize that while, one the one hand, what we are after as poets is
an attraction to chaos -a dialectic against power- the other side of the
coin, in the actual world this leads to wars, conflicts, people getting
killed. That is the tectonic dimension of the fall of the Soviet Empire. A
huge controlling force is removed. All sorts of historical pent-up
hostilities, wishes, hopes are released, and no force balances them. That
is, I think, the Chinese anxiety about dissent. One should not forget that
modern China is the results of centuries long conquests. What will happen i=
f
the lid comes off the pot? That's why the absolute insistence of the Chines=
e
that Taiwan must be part of the national state. The Unites States is
relatively l"ucky" in that way. The American Indians are so destroyed (and
now coopted through casino franchizes) that they are very unlikely to creat=
e
a national threat. Also, the American Civil War may have acted as an
inoculation, having occurred one and a half centuries earlier. Today, such =
a
war would have led to the disintegration of the state.

Ciao,

Murat

Hi Mark,

This year it was windy and cool for the season, so that would have
been a bunch of chilly-ish 'waifs and strays' (including a lot of
Poms) on Bondi Beach.

We still ate seafoood (oysters) and watermelon and watched the Queen's
message (she's now on YouTube, or is it WeTube for the royals?).

Now for the Sydney to Hobart yacht race and the Boxing Day test
(cricket) in Melbourne. Whether one watches these events or not (we
being in the 'not' camp, though I wouldn't mind seeing Tendulkar have
a hit), they are everpresent.

Someone said it was snowing in south-west Tassie but it's hot as
bug**ry in Perth.

Boxing Day cheers from Sydney,
Jill

Do you know Elaine Equi's poem, "Astor Piazzolla"?  We published it in
Court Green #2 (2005).  Backchannel me with your address and I'd be
happy to mail you a copy.

Best,
Tony

This isn&#39;t what it seems; I&#39;m doing beta testing for wireless
on a Jet Blue flight from Denver to New York City; it only allows one
to go to Yahoo. I&#39;m curious about the full header - we&#39;ll see.
I&#39;ve not been able to use telnet or get out of the proprietary
Yahoo environment. In a moment I&#39;ll play around with Net Stumbler
and see what comes up!

It's interesting to note that, in spite or maybe because of his experience with Nadia Boulanger, Piazzolla later wrote many "tango" works for classical musicians, some of which I have heard played in standard classical concerts.  So he ended up being a lot more than just a cabaret or a nightclub musician.  Still, this is a nice story about Boulanger and him.  Thanks for sharing it.  Regards, Tom Savage

very amazing & interesting piece--
i want to find out what kind of gum Carmontelle used!
his activities that included a "transparent" representation of a documentary
nature and the making of Earth Works--the artificial topologies/environments
of "Gardens" and parks, the pastoral from which labor is vanished except for
that simulated by artistocrats toying with a hoe--
the use of "son et lumiere"--
very stimulating and thought proving piece--
the mixing of the tracing of forms with the addition of imagined ones as
decorations which as are also "natural" --
the bare limbs of trees traced carefully from window view--with the fruits
of another season added--
a "compression" of time into one image using the "documentary" and the
"imaginary/from memory"--
in which there is a from of the resolution of WCW's "Only the Imagination is
real"  (Spring and All, 1926) and "no ideas but in things, Mr" from latter
1940's Paterson)
"travel" as the unwinding of the of the scroll--the method of the later
panoramas, except here lit from back trhough a screen rather than lit from
the front, onto an opaque background on top of which the image "sits"--
the mimicing of the Enlgish style of the park, which is "closer to Nature"
than the artificality of th French styles--
the screen and park as liminal spaces of the representational and the
imaginary--
quite different from the liminal cemeteries serving as conduits to both the
suburbs and eternity--
(though Carmontelle's work is for the entertainment of upper classes, and
the cemetery-parks for the utilitarian/spiritual "uplift" of the
bougeoisie)--

It is with a heavy heart that I write to share the news that
Sylvester Pollet, poet, publisher, and associate editor for the
National Poetry Foundation, passed away on December 20th.

As many on the Poetics List can attest to firsthand, Sylvester was a
magnificent person whose passion for life, for poetry, for
friendship, was unquenchable. We mourn his loss and celebrate his
wonderful accomplishment, treasuring the volumes of poetry, the
Backwoods Broadsides chaplets, the invaluable editorial work (most
recently on Joanne Kyger's ABOUT NOW), and the countless fond
memories he leaves behind.

Sylvester's wife, the artist MaJo Keleshian, has asked that those
wishing to honor his memory consider contributing to the Himalayan
Children's Fund, a cause very dear to Sylvester and MaJo for many
years (especially following their trip to Nepal of several years ago,
where they saw for themselves the good work accomplished by donations
to the Fund). More about the program, and how to donate, can be found
here:

	http://www.rinpoche.com/hcf.html

MaJo has also asked that any postings to this list be cc'd to her at

	MaJo_Keleshian@umit.maine.edu

To close, a short poem from Sylvester's 1982 volume, Entering the
Walking-Stick Business:

  SELF-PORTRAIT WITH SNOW

you understand
I could tell you more
about the lines of snow
edging the black maples
the clumps of it weighting the pine boughs
if it weren't for the transparent man
typing at a floating table
three feet beyond the window

Hard-hitting investigative reporter Mike DeRosa continues his series on the

DeRosa's investigative reporting should appeal to many subscribers to the
Poetics List. He addresses many political and social issues discussed on the
List. I recommend it highly.

John Cunningham managed to get Peterson alone with a bottle of scotch. What luck.  I never saw Peterson live. I did manage to catch a number of jazz legends who played with Peterson at the Lake Bueno Vista lounge in Orlando, Florida. Of course, the lounge is no longer in Bueno Vista. It was too good to last. Still, I won't forget seeing Herb Ellis, Barney Kessel, Zoot Sims, & Nat Adderly at the lounge. During breaks, the musicians would generously chat with their fans. Barney Kessel would give a mini/seminar during intermissions. Guitar players regarded him as something of a guru, & rightfully so.

Did he ever play in the Charlie Parker Festival?  If he did, then I did hear him once.  My memory of him is so strong, I must have encountered him somewhere or other in New York's very small jazz universe.  Regards, Tom Savage

That is very sad and indeed bad news -- Sylvester cared utterly for =
poetry
and spent much energy time money and care on getting poems out into the
world, encouraging poets to write, helping them to publish -- what =
obviously
and immediately comes to mind is his let's-face-it quite extravagant and
persistent project Backwoods Broadsides, 100 issues over how many years? =
100
poets, ALL worth reading. And his enthusiastic organising of those =
wonderful
readings at the sundry successive NPF Conference readings --a GENEROUS =
mind
and heart, one of the unsung. Yes. His death is desolating -- he's a
blessing. And damn, he will be missed.

This is shocking to me and very sad.  I loved getting mailings from him:
Om Mane Padme Hum around New Year's, and the Backwoods series.  He
seemed to have so much heart, so much so that it carried through in
these mailings, and much more so, of course, in person; intellectual and
emotional intelligence.  May he experience a glorious continuation in
all his aspects.

Re. his classical works, Piazzolla composed a remarkable opera using
'tango' forms, "Maria of Buenos Aires,"  Prostitutes, their lovers,
death, etc.  It was revived recently and performed at NYU's Skirball Center.

Didn't Peterson perform with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie in 1950 =
in
Montreal. I believe the session was recorded and released as 'The =
Greatest
Jazz Concert Ever' or something like that?

John Cunningham managed to get Peterson alone with a bottle of scotch. =
What
luck.  I never saw Peterson live. I did manage to catch a number of jazz
legends who played with Peterson at the Lake Bueno Vista lounge in =
Orlando,
Florida. Of course, the lounge is no longer in Bueno Vista. It was too =
good
to last. Still, I won't forget seeing Herb Ellis, Barney Kessel, Zoot =
Sims,
& Nat Adderly at the lounge. During breaks, the musicians would =
generously
chat with their fans. Barney Kessel would give a mini/seminar during
intermissions. Guitar players regarded him as something of a guru, &
rightfully so.=20

  The chapbooks are published in an edition of 400 copies. While chapbooks rarely receive exposure, ours have been reviewed in Poets and Writers, Publishers Weekly, American Poet, The Georgia Review, Small Press Review and many others. Our previous winners have had subsequent full length books appear from a bevy of publishers including Curbstone Press, Cleveland State University Press, Bear Star Press, Blazevox Books, University of Georgia, and Hanging Loose Press.

  Submit up to 32 pages of poetry. Include a signed cover letter with your name, address, phone number, e-mail, publication credits, a brief biography and the title of the chapbook. Include a cover page with your contact information and the chapbook title. Include a second page with the chapbook title only. Do not include your name on any pages inside the manuscript except for the first title page. No need for a contents page. All chapbooks are selected blindly / anonymously. Entry fee: $12.

  If you wish to send via regular mail your manuscript should be accompanied by a check in the amount of $12.00 made payable to Pavement Saw Press. All US contributors to the contest will receive books, chapbooks and journals equal to, or more than, the entry fee. Add $3 (US) for other countries to cover the extra postal charge. Do not include an SASE for notification of results, this information will be sent with the free book. Do not send the only copy of your work. All manuscripts are recycled and individual comments on the manuscripts cannot be made. Manuscripts will be considered until December 31st, 2007 for the prize. This year the editor will be the judge and, as it should be, he promises not to chose former students, former or potential sexual partners, press interns, or people that can make him famous. In addition to the prize winner, sometimes another anonymous manuscript is published under a standard royalty contract. A decision will be reached in March. Entries
 should be sent to our address at the bottom of the page.

  If you wish to submit electronically, you should send $18.00 via paypal to info@pavementsaw.org. We will then send you an e-mail confirmation as well as where to e-mail the manuscript.

I haven't been able to confirm this. There's several "Greatest Concerts." I thought the Montreal concert in 1950 would be easy to search. Wrong.

John Cunningham managed to get Peterson alone with a bottle of scotch. What
luck.  I never saw Peterson live. I did manage to catch a number of jazz
legends who played with Peterson at the Lake Bueno Vista lounge in Orlando,
Florida. Of course, the lounge is no longer in Bueno Vista. It was too good
to last. Still, I won't forget seeing Herb Ellis, Barney Kessel, Zoot Sims,
& Nat Adderly at the lounge. During breaks, the musicians would generously
chat with their fans. Barney Kessel would give a mini/seminar during
intermissions. Guitar players regarded him as something of a guru, &
rightfully so.

Peterson, too, when I saw the obituary in the Times, although I don't think
I ever heard him live.  Did he ever play in the Charlie Parker Festival?  If
he did, then I did hear him once.  My memory of him is so strong, I must
have encountered him somewhere or other in New York's very small jazz
universe.  Regards, Tom Savage

San Francisco, probably 1975 or 1974. I was in college and went alone
to that one. I sat just a bit behind Clint Eastwood. The entire room
seemed like it didn't hold more than 75 people or so. All I remember
is feeling like I wasn't really any "place" at all. Just in the music.

 I hope this link will work to get folks over to the review of Jenny Holzer's show at MASS MOCA - particular where the projections make use of Iraq related war plans - Rumsfeld and company's langauge of conquest, objectives, etc.  Hats off to Holzer for taking on the subject - elevating the invisible 'footnotes' (as this Administration wanted them no doubt to remain) into a VizPo spectacle of national embarassment (which this Administration will never acknowledge). Holzer seems to have elevated so-called and dismissed "hind sight" into the glaring receptacle of the present.
 Hats off to Holzer. And thanks to Ron Silliman  for  bringing it to the fore - I missed it somehow. & wish I could go there!

 For more tidy holiday  fare, I recommend  Starting Out One Evening as a terrific literaly 'literary' movie. Description will make it not interesting. Touching and funny. And for those of us who grew up in the era - hegemony? -  of "The Jewish Novel" - it's a kind of discrete elegy for the passing of  a time and space in New York letters. (Yes, very upper west side without the W Allen anxious antics).

 I hear the Schnabel film is wonderful, as well. Next on the list.

What he is thinking of is the famous one in Toronto,
a group made by votes from Jazz fans.
It was indeed marketed as the greatest blah blah blah.

Bird, Diz, Max Roach, Bud Powell and Charlie Mingus.
1953
We have it only because Mingus set up some inexpert mikes
and released it on his own label.
It has since been rereleased many times.

Vanity - Article on my work, sites, new address, etc.


An excellent article on my work etc. in Signal to Noise, 'The Journal of
Improvised & Experimental Music,' December issue, p. 44., 'The Impossible
Ritual, Through film, digital media, dance, words, and improvisational
music, Alan Sondheim investigates the shortcomings and impossibilities of
behavior,' by Clifford Allen. If you're interested, this is one of the
best accounts I've seen. I found a copy at Barnes & Noble - do check it
out.

New work at http://odysseyart.ning.com/ - which has a lot of fascinating
tapes by a number of people associated with Second Life etc.

New work at http://nikuko.blogspot.com/ - some of this you might have
seen, but not in this linear presentation.

New work at http://www.youtube.com/

Usual chatter on Facebook.

Also, check out Barbara Caspar's film on Kathy Acker if you can (I saw it at
Moma) - excellent -

New address:

Alan Sondheim and Azure Carter
813 Charles Avenue
Morgantown, West Virginia, 26505

The phone will stay 718-813-3285.
This is good for the next six months.

This year was the smoothest Christmas I've ever had. For the first time I
can remember, the tree didn't fall down. I think it's karma making up for
the year I've had, where time to scratch myself was in short supply.

But now it's too hot to read or even to go outside (38 degrees and oh woe,
worse promised) and the Wii has been stolen by my son. So I've spent the
past couple of days wrestling with css to update my sadly neglected website.
I've linked to a couple of recentish essays and poems that might interest
some of you, and done some general housework and spit and polish.

If anyone cares to look, and especially if they use IE6 or IE7, which I
can't test on my machine, I'd be grateful if they could tell me if it all
goes pearshaped in their browsers... The beautiful pixels are over at

I want to add to what Peter and Maria have said about Sylvester whose
steadiness and quiet assuredness in his demeanor and poetry have been
for me for decades a great comfort. He also for me represented an
important living embodiment of the New American Poetry and all that it
has meant including the writing but well beyond that too, having worked
many years ago at the Eighth Street Bookshop in Greenwich Village, where
I purchased my first copy of the Donald Allen anthology, and then in
settling down in Orono and being an integral part of Sagetrieb and more
broadly the National Poetry Foundation. His passing is most sad.

It is with a heavy heart that I write to share the news that =3D20

Sylvester Pollet, poet, publisher, and associate editor for the =3D20

National Poetry Foundation, passed away on December 20th.

=20

As many on the Poetics List can attest to firsthand, Sylvester was a =
=3D20

magnificent person whose passion for life, for poetry, for =3D20

friendship, was unquenchable. We mourn his loss and celebrate his =3D20

wonderful accomplishment, treasuring the volumes of poetry, the =3D20

Backwoods Broadsides chaplets, the invaluable editorial work (most =3D20

recently on Joanne Kyger's ABOUT NOW), and the countless fond =3D20

memories he leaves behind.

=20

Sylvester's wife, the artist MaJo Keleshian, has asked that those =3D20

wishing to honor his memory consider contributing to the Himalayan =3D20

Children's Fund, a cause very dear to Sylvester and MaJo for many =3D20

years (especially following their trip to Nepal of several years ago,
=3D20

where they saw for themselves the good work accomplished by donations
=3D20

to the Fund). More about the program, and how to donate, can be found

MaJo has also asked that any postings to this list be cc'd to her at

To close, a short poem from Sylvester's 1982 volume, Entering the =3D20

Walking-Stick Business:

=20

  SELF-PORTRAIT WITH SNOW

you understand

I could tell you more

about the lines of snow

edging the black maples

the clumps of it weighting the pine boughs

if it weren't for the transparent man

typing at a floating table

three feet beyond the window

Bud Powell on piano, & no Peterson, right?

It was indeed marketed as the greatest blah blah blah.

Bird, Diz, Max Roach, Bud Powell and Charlie Mingus.
1953
We have it only because Mingus set up some inexpert mikes
and released it on his own label.
It has since been rereleased many times.

Dear Stephen:

        I recently an interesting short piece by the American Indian writer
James Welch regarding the Jewish novel and "Novels of Assimilation"  among
others which dominated the literary news of his youth. "The assimilation
into American life"--Welch writes--for an Indian as THE American does not
exist.  "American life" is foreign life, and a foreign life in which the
Indian has never been wante and in which the Indian does not want to be. .
Portnoy had a complaint, Welch notes, and it is heard and  sells in the
millions, it becomes a "great book."   An Indian has no complaint, Welch
says, because a complaint, like everything else, would be taken away.  Some
one else would take it away and make millions and have it be called "a great
book."  So an Indian has no complaint, no assimilation. Something other,
else, has to be found, already existing, being made, moving among knowns and
unknowns, the first and existing "America".

 "O, say can you see . . ."

      Reading through the various articles about the "Projections" show and
looking at the images in photos. one finds an immediate and unquestioning
"belief" in the Institutionalized Aestheticization of words and images which
on their first appearance in newspapers,  tv screens were greeted with much
the same unquestioning and immediate belief.  The reviews of Holzer's show
echo the rave reviews for going to War with Iraq, Home of the Worst Monster
in the World and the untold horrors threatening WMD extinction of Israel,
Great Britain and the USA.   While the reception is the same, there is the
literally BIG difference between the old Rumsfield  documents and the new
Holzer ones in that the new ones are no longer "lies" and "mistakes" but
Great Works of Art . These will make a bundle for Ms Holzer, her galleries
and associates,  and find ultimately , like the politicos involved, "good
private/corporate homes" to "pass the rest of their days in."

   The giant paintings made of memos taken from cyber space images--how
different are they from the online images and documents that Curveball used
to give to the German BND who passed on this  "intelligence" to the CIA,
DIA, and other American organizations and created these very memos?  This
already-on-line "intelligence" was used to start the Invasion/Occupation
campaign for the Iraq war, just as the "intelligence" Holzer uses becomes a
new American installation campaign for Ms Holzer.  (All the review and
articles note this is her first American installation of the "Projections"
works, as well as the use of a Real Poet's words used in place of her own
"more moralistic" ones being new)

     "Won't get fooled again,"!! the reviewers and public cry who troop to
see the same documents which fooled them the first around.  No, this time
the same words and images used to slaughter millions and cost trillions will
be turned to the quiet business of making "art world" money and "selling"
the public on "being able to distinguish the difference between a big
painting and a virtual version of a small document." Different media,
different objectives, same campaign:  SELL the reviewers and public on the
"Installation" of these words and images as Truth.  First Rumsfield & Co's
Truth, now Holzer's Truth.

    The Artist, Art World and Art Market "Triumph" and profit, from this
"sleight of hand". Mean while the politicians and military attempt to
"surge" forward from the jaws of near defeat.

 To make up for the former "wrong belief" of cheering the documents' Truth,
the  reviewers and public may now witness and rave about the "purifying of
the language of the tribe" via a Very Highly and Institutionally Approved
Artist's "renditions" of "bad words" into an Aesthetic-Ethical Realm of the
Good.  Beholding one's own now Light-Bath cleansed reflection in the Image
which has cleansed the Words,--is this not "Good?" (For the soul, the
pocketbook, the Institutions, the Artist, America?)

       The art works may also be seen another way.  What if the viewer is a
True Believer in the Greatness of the War and its Architects, its Document
Makers?  Then do not these art works confirm the Heroic Status of those
involved--Rummie, Bush, et alia?

       The manner of the presentation, which the Times reviewer likens to  a
post apocalyptic, empty political or rock'rool' stadium--doesn't it echo
magnificently the Art and Architecture of Leni Riefenstahl and Albert Speer?


       To further enhance the aestheticization of the political, (which
Walter Benjamin noted is the Fascist way), the spectator is bathed in
rippling waves of words made of letters of light--and not just any
words--but the "impressionistic" lyric poetry of a Nobel Prize Winner.

        The "impressionistically" lyricized and lit spectator advances--or
is ensconced, agog,  in the the "artfully scattered" giant bean bag chairs
often found in front of the  "Home" TVs of the Homeland----into the
Spectacular Light Show glorifying the paintings.  "Let there be Light"--and
the documents are now "up-lifted" in Moral Aesthetic parlance, in to the
realms of High Art, into the Aura of  Great Art and the Great Artist. (For
were not Speer and Riefenstahl the  Artists who transformed the works of the
"failed artist" into Great Works of Art glorifying his ascension into the
Being of Supreme Artist?)


        Behold O spectator, O puny being of lyrical lightness--the great
tablets of Mammon, Deity of War and Art.  Behold the dirty Rumsfield Files
metastasized,  the blood lusting documents  Super Steroid  Sized, and the
Return of the Aura of the Original to what had once been mere copies of
copies of copies based on forgeries, faulty analysis, deliberate
mistranslations, in turn  based on copies of copies of things which were
interpreted to be something else other than what they were subsequently
found and/or not found to be.

        Where the "original" WMDS were not found, are found now Temples of
Art where the Resurrection of Death's Documents is accomplished, the
redemption of Lying Copies achieved and the wiping clean of guilt
accomplished in the Triumphant Celebration of the Signature of Art and
Artist over the Signature of mere Party hacks.
      What was once copies, forgeries, lies, is now made Original, Truth,
Art. ("O say can you see . . . ")

        And as the lyric-and light-bathed spectator lifts an adoring and
completely Believing gaze to the Aestheticized Political Documents,
near-starvation homeless farmers and imported near-slave laborers under the
dangerous watch of Contractors like Black Water are digging up the last
vestiges of the vast historical strati of Iraqi history. These rapidly
dwindling supplies of artifacts and documents in the world's oldest writing
are being shipped out and sold off to the highest or most closely associated
bidder.  ("O say, can you see . . . ")

         While a civilization vanishes, its destroyers celebrate its
destruction with the Spectacular
Exhibition of their discredited war plans raised to the status of Art. ("O,
say can you see . . . ")

  High Art, Art of Great Value and Importance, Art of the Land of the Free
and the Home of the Brave.
         One feels a Patriotic swelling in the breast, the genesis of the
Patriotic Act and the Patriot Act.  The right hand goes almost automatically
to its place above the heart and--standing at attention--one joins in the
Mighty Choir of "Projections" and Lights:

           Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
      Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

That's right.

Prosody Castle, an Oakland, Ca. reading series is focusing its 2008
calendar on HIV/AIDS and is looking for writers, genre pliable, who
are currently thinking on the pandemic in any of its aspects.
Particularly interested in new or newish writing, but also would be
thrilled to give an airing to a manuscript or work from the past that
never got its day in the sun. There is a performance/reading
component, for which funding is available for travel and honorarium,
as well as a print component that seeks to publish excerpts, either
first rights or reprint, of what was read. We are also talking to
researchers, activists and organizers and possibly pairing these
perspectives each month, so this is in many ways more than a reading
series (I'm not entirely sure what it is anymore, but it's exciting).

If it's you, or someone you know of or have read, let me know. Any
and all leads are appreciated, as we're casting a wide net. Back-
channel is probably appropriate, unless someone wants to use this
opportunity to point everyone to something that's out there.

thanks and have a good new year (could anything be worse than 2007),

Dillon

Barry,
I've seen it, and think I still have a copy.  I don't know where you might =
get one; Vincent gave me the one I have 15 years ago when he came up here t=
o read. If you can't scratch one up, let me know, and I'll try to have a co=
py made off mine, or, if that doesn't work, I'll simply send you the one I =
have. It's certainly worth watching.  In the meantime, hasn't Henry=20

recently completed a film on Olson as well, which, I think I noticed somewh=

Wouldn't it be an insult to expect a Native American to assimilate? Isn't
that's exactly what happened, especially as regards education? I'm presently reading a novel of assimilation of the sort you describe.  In Philip Roth's "The Plot Against America," FDR is defeated by Charles Lindbergh in the 1940 presidential election. Lindbergh negotiates a cordial 'understanding' with Adolf Hitler. Jews who had thought of America as a safe haven find themselves in a country reminiscent of  the Europe where pogroms and various other types of persecution were the norm.

There's plenty of decent art in D.C., but rarely anything political. I'd like to see the
Holzer exhibit. Perhaps it will travel. Too often, I find political art to be parasitic, allowing the viewer an easy, undeserved catharsis. None-the-less, I'm eager for art that's even remotely political.

  Dear Stephen:

I recently an interesting short piece by the American Indian writer
James Welch regarding the Jewish novel and "Novels of Assimilation" among
others which dominated the literary news of his youth. "The assimilation
into American life"--Welch writes--for an Indian as THE American does not
exist. "American life" is foreign life, and a foreign life in which the
Indian has never been wante and in which the Indian does not want to be. .
Portnoy had a complaint, Welch notes, and it is heard and sells in the
millions, it becomes a "great book." An Indian has no complaint, Welch
says, because a complaint, like everything else, would be taken away. Some
one else would take it away and make millions and have it be called "a great
book." So an Indian has no complaint, no assimilation. Something other,
else, has to be found, already existing, being made, moving among knowns and
unknowns, the first and existing "America".

"O, say can you see . . ."

Reading through the various articles about the "Projections" show and
looking at the images in photos. one finds an immediate and unquestioning
"belief" in the Institutionalized Aestheticization of words and images which
on their first appearance in newspapers, tv screens were greeted with much
the same unquestioning and immediate belief. The reviews of Holzer's show
echo the rave reviews for going to War with Iraq, Home of the Worst Monster
in the World and the untold horrors threatening WMD extinction of Israel,
Great Britain and the USA. While the reception is the same, there is the
literally BIG difference between the old Rumsfield documents and the new
Holzer ones in that the new ones are no longer "lies" and "mistakes" but
Great Works of Art . These will make a bundle for Ms Holzer, her galleries
and associates, and find ultimately , like the politicos involved, "good
private/corporate homes" to "pass the rest of their days in."

The giant paintings made of memos taken from cyber space images--how
different are they from the online images and documents that Curveball used
to give to the German BND who passed on this "intelligence" to the CIA,
DIA, and other American organizations and created these very memos? This
already-on-line "intelligence" was used to start the Invasion/Occupation
campaign for the Iraq war, just as the "intelligence" Holzer uses becomes a
new American installation campaign for Ms Holzer. (All the review and
articles note this is her first American installation of the "Projections"
works, as well as the use of a Real Poet's words used in place of her own
"more moralistic" ones being new)

"Won't get fooled again,"!! the reviewers and public cry who troop to
see the same documents which fooled them the first around. No, this time
the same words and images used to slaughter millions and cost trillions will
be turned to the quiet business of making "art world" money and "selling"
the public on "being able to distinguish the difference between a big
painting and a virtual version of a small document." Different media,
different objectives, same campaign: SELL the reviewers and public on the
"Installation" of these words and images as Truth. First Rumsfield & Co's
Truth, now Holzer's Truth.

The Artist, Art World and Art Market "Triumph" and profit, from this
"sleight of hand". Mean while the politicians and military attempt to
"surge" forward from the jaws of near defeat.

To make up for the former "wrong belief" of cheering the documents' Truth,
the reviewers and public may now witness and rave about the "purifying of
the language of the tribe" via a Very Highly and Institutionally Approved
Artist's "renditions" of "bad words" into an Aesthetic-Ethical Realm of the
Good. Beholding one's own now Light-Bath cleansed reflection in the Image
which has cleansed the Words,--is this not "Good?" (For the soul, the
pocketbook, the Institutions, the Artist, America?)

The art works may also be seen another way. What if the viewer is a
True Believer in the Greatness of the War and its Architects, its Document
Makers? Then do not these art works confirm the Heroic Status of those
involved--Rummie, Bush, et alia?

The manner of the presentation, which the Times reviewer likens to a
post apocalyptic, empty political or rock'rool' stadium--doesn't it echo
magnificently the Art and Architecture of Leni Riefenstahl and Albert Speer?


To further enhance the aestheticization of the political, (which
Walter Benjamin noted is the Fascist way), the spectator is bathed in
rippling waves of words made of letters of light--and not just any
words--but the "impressionistic" lyric poetry of a Nobel Prize Winner.

The "impressionistically" lyricized and lit spectator advances--or
is ensconced, agog, in the the "artfully scattered" giant bean bag chairs
often found in front of the "Home" TVs of the Homeland----into the
Spectacular Light Show glorifying the paintings. "Let there be Light"--and
the documents are now "up-lifted" in Moral Aesthetic parlance, in to the
realms of High Art, into the Aura of Great Art and the Great Artist. (For
were not Speer and Riefenstahl the Artists who transformed the works of the
"failed artist" into Great Works of Art glorifying his ascension into the
Being of Supreme Artist?)


Behold O spectator, O puny being of lyrical lightness--the great
tablets of Mammon, Deity of War and Art. Behold the dirty Rumsfield Files
metastasized, the blood lusting documents Super Steroid Sized, and the
Return of the Aura of the Original to what had once been mere copies of
copies of copies based on forgeries, faulty analysis, deliberate
mistranslations, in turn based on copies of copies of things which were
interpreted to be something else other than what they were subsequently
found and/or not found to be.

Where the "original" WMDS were not found, are found now Temples of
Art where the Resurrection of Death's Documents is accomplished, the
redemption of Lying Copies achieved and the wiping clean of guilt
accomplished in the Triumphant Celebration of the Signature of Art and
Artist over the Signature of mere Party hacks.
What was once copies, forgeries, lies, is now made Original, Truth,
Art. ("O say can you see . . . ")

And as the lyric-and light-bathed spectator lifts an adoring and
completely Believing gaze to the Aestheticized Political Documents,
near-starvation homeless farmers and imported near-slave laborers under the
dangerous watch of Contractors like Black Water are digging up the last
vestiges of the vast historical strati of Iraqi history. These rapidly
dwindling supplies of artifacts and documents in the world's oldest writing
are being shipped out and sold off to the highest or most closely associated
bidder. ("O say, can you see . . . ")

While a civilization vanishes, its destroyers celebrate its
destruction with the Spectacular
Exhibition of their discredited war plans raised to the status of Art. ("O,
say can you see . . . ")

High Art, Art of Great Value and Importance, Art of the Land of the Free
and the Home of the Brave.
One feels a Patriotic swelling in the breast, the genesis of the
Patriotic Act and the Patriot Act. The right hand goes almost automatically
to its place above the heart and--standing at attention--one joins in the
Mighty Choir of "Projections" and Lights:

Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

those two with cameras to video the slaughter of thousands of young harp
seals grok headline matches for the boston teaparty as ecoterrorism google
has no direct line to god and hence isnt worth a million dollars a share
stop the real ecoterrorism global warming a weapon of mass destruction god
hates fags counter protest

  is the existence of ecoterrorism japanese whalers leave for slaughter
mission whale watch specials has rejected allegations from japanese
whalers that he supports ecoterrorism member since aug location southern
by the grace of god posts no im not an ecoterrorist nor do i agree with
ecoterrorism and slaughtering animals that peta pretends to protect theyve
provided cash assistance and oh m god peter brady is selling the ab lounge
now ugh neodruid anarchist student of deep ecology ecoterrorism disappear
spend the next fifty years breeding and return to slaughter their exslaves
this avant garde of ecoterrorism ie bad for the global economy the present
god of technology and science tells people that there will be a bishop
urges christians to call god allah

  muskens thinks it could take another you know the indiscrimnate slaughter
and killing of christians and thats eco terrorism and sorry but its not
something the environmental to leave the area and to stop assisting with
the illegal slaughter of whales i reject all of these ridiculous
anthropocentric monkey god religions we are concerned about the northern
bush meat trade ie the slaughter for mcinnis subcommittee conducted a
hearing on ecoterrorism last month so bombing is the correct answer my god
do you care about human life at all remember fred phelps of god hates fags
is a democrat and supported al gore did i link to all the ecoterrorism
events and try to pen it on the sion to move ecoterrorism

  to the top of the fbi list vernon s article greatly relies on infor
slaughter or b) now strictly protected after being objection first it
would seem that god wants us to eat only vegetables in of plants by eating
them than we do by slaughtering cows pigs etc the barbaric slaughter at
virginia tech did not

  and does not escape in the religious context ismail is translated as
meaning god has harkened i would say ecoterrorism is a very appropriate
label so when you see him with his god bless israeli bulldozers sign i
want you to keep several in the matter of ecoterrorism this is where i
stand any ecoterrorism but those slaughtering now like whales why the hell

Vandals rip into Robert Frost home

RIPTON, Vermont (AP) -- A former home of poet Robert Frost has been
vandalized, with intruders destroying dozens of items and setting
fire to furniture in what police say was an underage drinking party.

Homer Noble Farm, a former Frost residence that's now a historic
landmark, was ransacked late Friday night during a party attended by
up to 50 people, Sgt. Lee Hodsden said Monday.

The intruders broke a window to get into the two-story wood frame
building -- a furnished residence open in the summer -- before
destroying tables and chairs, pictures, windows, light fixtures and
dishes. Wicker furniture and dressers were smashed and thrown into a
fireplace and burned, apparently to provide heat in the unheated
building, he said.

Empty beer bottles and cans, plastic cups and cellophane apparently
used to hold marijuana were also found, according to Hodsden. The
vandals vomited in the living room and discharged two fire
extinguishers inside the building, located on a dead-end road off
Route 125.

No arrests have been made, Hodsden said, adding that they've tracked
down some partygoers and believe they are minors.
The damage was discovered Saturday by a hiker who notified police at
Middlebury College, which maintains the site. The cabin's caretaker
was last there at 10 a.m. Friday, police said.

Frost, a celebrated New England poet known for such verse as "The
Road Not Taken" and "The Gift Outright," died in 1963. He summered at
the home from 1939 to 1963.

Subject:      Chicago Poetry Marathon: A Postmortem
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

This year's version of the unofficial MLA offsite poetry reading, entitled "The Chicago Poetry Marathon," brought together over fifty poets and somewhere between 200 and 300 poetry lovers, to the ballroom at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Organized by Robert Archambeau, Patrick Durgin, and Jennifer Karmin, the event was 2.5 hours of poetry, in two minute slices, as is the custom of these massive wordslingings.

Durgin provided the opening salvo, introducing the event as one that "coincides with the MLA, but is not in or of it,"--which took the Jesuitical slogan "in the world, but not of it," one step closer to the margins. Durgin, one of the dandiest poets around (in all senses of that term, though his poetry, to my ear, hews closer to straight edge), ceded to the readers, beginning alphabetically with Joe Amato.

What follows is a somewhat documentary, mostly impressionistic take on the proceedings, as I scribbled down what I could of what I was hearing and seeing. Some of the lines quoted are no doubt mishearings, but isn't that part of the fun of consuming poetry?

Joe Amato: "this next one/is all I can say....all I can say is this next one." A perfect opening salvo, a metapoem of the stutterings of poetry reading introductions. This is the "A Salty Salute" (vague GBV reference) of the reading-- i.e. "the club is open."

Robert Archambeau, from his "Sheena is a Punk Rocker": "a big screen six foot pinup queen." A poem about how a song got written. Anyone who writes about the Ramones is okay in my book. Plus, he somehow got the speed and pop sheen of the Ramones into the poem.

Ray Bianchi, Chicago poet, editor of the new Chicago poetry anthology, and general propangandist and mafioso for the scene: "the composition delayed the season." Yes. Snow stopped just in time for the reading.

Tisa Bryant: "witnessing a type of entrapment." Wow. "Suddenly overwrought with sensations of going to the dentist." About a mythic figure whose name rhymes with Omeros...

Dodie Bellamy: appearing out of the silence of her earlier absence, reading "Snow Globe": "John, why didn't you get cigarettes before we dropped acid." And "we can't see out the windshield,"--homage, perhaps, to "no one to drive the car" and "look out where yr going"?

Charles Cantaloupo had us call-and-responding "light the lights," first instance of audience participation (willing, I might add, which is nice given the tough crowd that we poets can be about such things).

Stephen Cope: "Thirteen Ways of Killing the President": "the wrong finger fired." "I might as well kill the President." (After the reading, a distraught woman wandered the ballroom, asking if she might find this poet who offered to kill the President. He was never found.)

Josh Corey: "Lecture on Modernism": "they are, how do you say, apropos to zero." Very Jamesian indeed. And: "look I found a decorum" and "memory is rarely progressive" and "a banner is completed by a wind."

Joel Craig's "Ry Cooder": "he has recovered from what he has achieved." Amen. So few of us actually do.

Elizabeth Cross: "The Most Desirable Romance in the World": funny, bawdy dialogue between God and Eve, in which Eve tires of God's hangups about Adam, despite his sexual power. "I have chosen and made a chamber in thee." One of a number of women poets reading powerfully about sex. The men, however, somewhat absent on the theme (except for Kevin Killian and Bob Perelman's detachable penis). Are men poets afraid to look skeezy?

Garin Cycholl: "nothing in writing is easier to raise than the dead." And a funny, looped, "what's more American/than screwing/the ladylady/of the rent." Added and subtracted. Well done.

Michael Davidson, from "Bad Modernism": told from the point of view of an indigenous person displayed at the World's Fair, if I'm not completely mistaken: "the eyes go there while the will stands still."

Patrick Durgin, from "relay": "what's nearest is inhaled." And "luminaries suck and also-rans wheeze." If Pavement ever needs another lyricist, you're hired! P.S. Let's form a band.

Joel Felix: "with horror, I opened the toolbox." A real laugh-line.

Kass Fleischer: in a poem voicing a poet's disdain of what language poetry hath wrought (and the all form/no content dogma that it unfortunately has spawned): "hours and hours and not a drop of urgency." There was a palpable audience response--Archambeau heard both cheers and jeers--from my perch, it seemed like mostly positive. Courageous rant, given the crowd.

G.S. Giscombe: "a sexual image about the prairie might be a good idea." "Can't forget, Effingham." Also, referenced "content" as something that poetry does, rhyming with Fleischer.

Renee Gladman: "the solitary confinement of this part of our century." Yes, the century's already old. Let's blow this 21st century.

Chris Glomski: "Infinity", a recurring line: "to become a vague forest blooming where there is room." Line I wish I wrote. Vague keeps it real.

Steven Halle: "don't fight to stay ahead of weather." Very Emersonian.

Duriel Harris: what a word slinger, what a performer. She changed voices so fast I was afraid for her! "Jacket habit...slingshot pragmatic...."

Bill Howe: I'm still in debt to Bill for his multivocal piece last year (it generated at least a few poems, and led to what I did this year). I love his "concordant disorder," a poem about fauna.

Pierre Joris: regarding the Titanic, and perhaps our own imperial fates: "no, upgrading to first class won't save your ass." THE Pierre Joris.

Jennifer Karmin, she of the "walking tours" projects, did a dialogue poem from Ted Berrigan's words, with Chuck Stebleton: "an ongoing middle/made of words/larger than words." The more I do poetry, the more I'm interested in these sorts of multivocal arrangements.

Kevin Killian, who, by the way, inspires this post from his previously lush recollections and instamemoirs posted to the Buffalo list, about Orono conferences in the past. Just to prove that he is absolute gold--he actually went around at Orono and asked those who published in the Best American Poetry series to sign his book. "Norwegian Wood," a poem about K.O. sex (which involves something like four downers, if memory serves): "when people say they are having sex, what is it that they are having?" I think I got that wrong, but it seems to match the spirit.

David Lloyd: "the act split from the work." "The pleasure of a ghost." Yes, I'm a fan of spiritual visitation.

Nicole Markotic: "Joey avoids dark liquids to make his body see-through." This, I gather, a poem about Mormon scripture. Mitt Romney, cower in fear of Markotic! She will caffeinate you!

Cate Marvin: "Flowers Always." She of the LEGITIMATE DANGERS. "I have never seen an always." A line worthy of Magnetic Fields' Stephin Merritt.

Philip Metres: I did a Lev Rubinstein performance of "Unnamed Events," soundtracked by Pavement's "Zurich is Stained" and with shouting of the Russian--which, apparently, some couldn't hear and others couldn't see. Next time, I was instructed to stand on chair and yell louder. Here's a digital version of the text, for those of you shut out from view by the Bill Howes. http://www.geoffreygatza.com/arkv/2k3fl/phil4.htm. I mean, Bill, how tall are you, 6' 10"?

Laura Moriarity: "nothing is left to bark the dream...everyone was suspicious and resistant." Telling moment.

Simone Muench, whose name, it was revealed, is pronounced like "mensch," a poem about Leatherface: "misunderstanding seduction, you urge your chainsaw forward." Sounds like a dream date.

Aldon Nielson, whose name, it was revealed by Susan Schultz next to me, is actually pronounced al as in alchohol, not al as it "all." "The Virginia Monologues": "knocking the table of contents." "What was new about making it new?" Whose performance was shouted short by

Mark Nowak, a poem about mine disasters. Kudos to you, Mark Nowak, for docupoeting us a little bit. Words is good, and yet coal is real.

Kristy Odelius: "a listing agent negotiates closing." "Rising out of history like a scandal." Awesome. Are poets getting more beautiful, or am I just susceptible to people with beautiful words? Or I am just getting uglier?

Bob Perelman's "Current Poetics": reminding me why you're still my favorite language poet (all homage to the Hejinians and Wattens), bringing politics into painful pleasure with language: "porn the only commodity still behaving itself." Not to mention the detachable penis.

Kristen Prevallet read "The Day Lady Died" backward, for "Benazir Bhutto," and I was reminded again of Andrew Ross' controversial reading of that poem by O'Hara, in which he Marxisted O'Hara's consumerism. When Prevallet got to "ugly hamburger" and then the "poets in Ghana" line, I gasped.

Jen Scappetone, reading from something generated from (was it?) the Goat Island Performance Collective: "tunes Casanovas motorize." Williams's poem as machine crossed with the Boss?

Robyn Schiff: "it's March, there is fatness in the air." And, heartening to those of us mayflies who can't seem to write shit right on the first draft (damn you, Josh Corey!): "it's not true they last a day....they were larvae first...that takes many years..."

Susan Schultz showed us some signs that have appeared on fences in her Hawaiian town, part of the Sidewalk Blogger's freeing speech: "would Jesus waterboard?" and "Cheney=Straightshooter." More signs!

Don Share, a poem echoing the Bishopian "House that Jack Built" structure, found his way to "the hurt of older houses" and "the pudge of Prozac." Yeah, my body too.

Ed Skoog: "I count on this poem to investigate wrongdoing...reading this poem is like belonging to a group." Metapoetastic.

Chuck Stebleton: "hemorraging talent" ("so much style and it's wasted") and "You put Ohio in my impromptu." And a hilarious line echoing Shakespeare: "if pubes be wool..."

Mark Tardi, who confessed to be obsessed with nuclear waste disposal post-Chernobyl (aren't we all?): "roadsides favor promiscuity."

Catherine Taylor: "the lyric's past seduction." That works in so many ways.

Tony Trigilio: "They sound bells for us." And, about Rumsfeld's house: "the cameras in the Secretary's birdfeeders can see (?) them."

Nick Twemlow: a Howl-esque tribute to his hometown of Topeka: "the black keys being Topeka...Topeka, the sickness will go unnoticed." Topeka is a song, isn't it?

Quraysh Ali Lansana spun a tale of a slave named Jacob who finally escaped, because he loved the dogs more than the master: "the dogs never moved."

Lina Ramona Vitkauskas, from a poem called "Erection: A Single Entendre." Somehow, the title was poetry enough. Thinking of the Spinanes's "Rummy": "the power of erection/the tallest building in Chicago."

Barrett Watten, sampling Williams: "democracy is impossible and must be preserved." I could see the computer screen echoes in his eyeglasses. Somehow, that's a detail that seems right for the poet of exteriority.

Tyrone Williams, taking a collage of SUN TIMES lines: "can you see me now/caption only." Caption only, as refrain.

Tim Yu, bringing us home with an abecedarian: "the turning world gravitates on its absent stem....yowling unspeakable names to the zero of hearing."

Thanks to all the readers and ears out there. Jennifer Moxley, among other poetry luminaries, was spotted...but not on the readers' list?! I should have ceded my time.

I have seen several of Jenny Holzer's New York shows and loved them.  One was composed of hundreds of messages on plaques.  I bought several "copies" of these and have used them as reminders of things ever since: Protect Me From What I Want; The Beginnings of the War Will Be Secret; and Ownership Created Crime.  I made xerox copies of these and put them on my wall; the first of these on the inside of my door to prevent me from leaving my apartment to buy things on impulse that I don't really need and won't even want for very long.  I'm very sorry the current show isn't coming to New York City as I would love to see it.  I read the review and it sounds fascinating.  Regards, Tom Savage

I recently an interesting short piece by the American Indian writer
James Welch regarding the Jewish novel and "Novels of Assimilation" among
others which dominated the literary news of his youth. "The assimilation
into American life"--Welch writes--for an Indian as THE American does not
exist. "American life" is foreign life, and a foreign life in which the
Indian has never been wante and in which the Indian does not want to be. .
Portnoy had a complaint, Welch notes, and it is heard and sells in the
millions, it becomes a "great book." An Indian has no complaint, Welch
says, because a complaint, like everything else, would be taken away. Some
one else would take it away and make millions and have it be called "a great
book." So an Indian has no complaint, no assimilation. Something other,
else, has to be found, already existing, being made, moving among knowns and
unknowns, the first and existing "America".

"O, say can you see . . ."

Reading through the various articles about the "Projections" show and
looking at the images in photos. one finds an immediate and unquestioning
"belief" in the Institutionalized Aestheticization of words and images which
on their first appearance in newspapers, tv screens were greeted with much
the same unquestioning and immediate belief. The reviews of Holzer's show
echo the rave reviews for going to War with Iraq, Home of the Worst Monster
in the World and the untold horrors threatening WMD extinction of Israel,
Great Britain and the USA. While the reception is the same, there is the
literally BIG difference between the old Rumsfield documents and the new
Holzer ones in that the new ones are no longer "lies" and "mistakes" but
Great Works of Art . These will make a bundle for Ms Holzer, her galleries
and associates, and find ultimately , like the politicos involved, "good
private/corporate homes" to "pass the rest of their days in."

The giant paintings made of memos taken from cyber space images--how
different are they from the online images and documents that Curveball used
to give to the German BND who passed on this "intelligence" to the CIA,
DIA, and other American organizations and created these very memos? This
already-on-line "intelligence" was used to start the Invasion/Occupation
campaign for the Iraq war, just as the "intelligence" Holzer uses becomes a
new American installation campaign for Ms Holzer. (All the review and
articles note this is her first American installation of the "Projections"
works, as well as the use of a Real Poet's words used in place of her own
"more moralistic" ones being new)

"Won't get fooled again,"!! the reviewers and public cry who troop to
see the same documents which fooled them the first around. No, this time
the same words and images used to slaughter millions and cost trillions will
be turned to the quiet business of making "art world" money and "selling"
the public on "being able to distinguish the difference between a big
painting and a virtual version of a small document." Different media,
different objectives, same campaign: SELL the reviewers and public on the
"Installation" of these words and images as Truth. First Rumsfield & Co's
Truth, now Holzer's Truth.

The Artist, Art World and Art Market "Triumph" and profit, from this
"sleight of hand". Mean while the politicians and military attempt to
"surge" forward from the jaws of near defeat.

To make up for the former "wrong belief" of cheering the documents' Truth,
the reviewers and public may now witness and rave about the "purifying of
the language of the tribe" via a Very Highly and Institutionally Approved
Artist's "renditions" of "bad words" into an Aesthetic-Ethical Realm of the
Good. Beholding one's own now Light-Bath cleansed reflection in the Image
which has cleansed the Words,--is this not "Good?" (For the soul, the
pocketbook, the Institutions, the Artist, America?)

The art works may also be seen another way. What if the viewer is a
True Believer in the Greatness of the War and its Architects, its Document
Makers? Then do not these art works confirm the Heroic Status of those
involved--Rummie, Bush, et alia?

The manner of the presentation, which the Times reviewer likens to a
post apocalyptic, empty political or rock'rool' stadium--doesn't it echo
magnificently the Art and Architecture of Leni Riefenstahl and Albert Speer?


To further enhance the aestheticization of the political, (which
Walter Benjamin noted is the Fascist way), the spectator is bathed in
rippling waves of words made of letters of light--and not just any
words--but the "impressionistic" lyric poetry of a Nobel Prize Winner.

The "impressionistically" lyricized and lit spectator advances--or
is ensconced, agog, in the the "artfully scattered" giant bean bag chairs
often found in front of the "Home" TVs of the Homeland----into the
Spectacular Light Show glorifying the paintings. "Let there be Light"--and
the documents are now "up-lifted" in Moral Aesthetic parlance, in to the
realms of High Art, into the Aura of Great Art and the Great Artist. (For
were not Speer and Riefenstahl the Artists who transformed the works of the
"failed artist" into Great Works of Art glorifying his ascension into the
Being of Supreme Artist?)


Behold O spectator, O puny being of lyrical lightness--the great
tablets of Mammon, Deity of War and Art. Behold the dirty Rumsfield Files
metastasized, the blood lusting documents Super Steroid Sized, and the
Return of the Aura of the Original to what had once been mere copies of
copies of copies based on forgeries, faulty analysis, deliberate
mistranslations, in turn based on copies of copies of things which were
interpreted to be something else other than what they were subsequently
found and/or not found to be.

Where the "original" WMDS were not found, are found now Temples of
Art where the Resurrection of Death's Documents is accomplished, the
redemption of Lying Copies achieved and the wiping clean of guilt
accomplished in the Triumphant Celebration of the Signature of Art and
Artist over the Signature of mere Party hacks.
What was once copies, forgeries, lies, is now made Original, Truth,
Art. ("O say can you see . . . ")

And as the lyric-and light-bathed spectator lifts an adoring and
completely Believing gaze to the Aestheticized Political Documents,
near-starvation homeless farmers and imported near-slave laborers under the
dangerous watch of Contractors like Black Water are digging up the last
vestiges of the vast historical strati of Iraqi history. These rapidly
dwindling supplies of artifacts and documents in the world's oldest writing
are being shipped out and sold off to the highest or most closely associated
bidder. ("O say, can you see . . . ")

While a civilization vanishes, its destroyers celebrate its
destruction with the Spectacular
Exhibition of their discredited war plans raised to the status of Art. ("O,
say can you see . . . ")

High Art, Art of Great Value and Importance, Art of the Land of the Free
and the Home of the Brave.
One feels a Patriotic swelling in the breast, the genesis of the
Patriotic Act and the Patriot Act. The right hand goes almost automatically
to its place above the heart and--standing at attention--one joins in the
Mighty Choir of "Projections" and Lights:

Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

Thanks so much for that catalogue of characters --

>"mensch," a poem about Leatherface: "misunderstanding seduction,
>you urge your chainsaw forward." Sounds like a dream date.
>
>Aldon Nielson, whose name, it was revealed by Susan Schultz next to me, is
>actually pronounced al as in alchohol, not al as it "all." "The
>Virginia Monologues": "knocking the table of contents."
>"What was new about making it new?" Whose performance was shouted
>short by
>
>Mark Nowak, a poem about mine disasters. Kudos to you, Mark Nowak, for
>docupoeting us a little bit. Words is good, and yet coal is real.
>
>Kristy Odelius: "a listing agent negotiates closing." "Rising
>out of history like a scandal." Awesome. Are poets getting more beautiful,
>or am I just susceptible to people with beautiful words? Or I am just getting
>uglier?
>
>Bob Perelman's "Current Poetics": reminding me why you're still my
>favorite language poet (all homage to the Hejinians and Wattens),
>bringing politics into painful pleasure with language: "porn the only
>commodity still behaving itself." Not to mention the detachable penis.
>
>Kristen Prevallet read "The Day Lady Died" backward, for
>"Benazir Bhutto," and I was reminded again of Andrew Ross'
>controversial reading of that poem by O'Hara, in which he Marxisted O'Hara's
>consumerism. When Prevallet got to "ugly hamburger" and then the
>"poets in Ghana" line, I gasped.
>
>Jen Scappetone, reading from something generated from (was it?) the
>Goat Island Performance Collective: "tunes Casanovas motorize."
>Williams's poem as machine crossed with the Boss?
>
>Robyn Schiff: "it's March, there is fatness in the air." And,
>heartening to those of us mayflies who can't seem to write shit right on the
>first draft (damn you, Josh Corey!): "it's not true they last a
>day....they were larvae first...that takes many years..."
>
>Susan Schultz showed us some signs that have appeared on fences in her Hawaiian
>town, part of the Sidewalk Blogger's freeing speech: "would Jesus
>waterboard?" and "Cheney=Straightshooter." More signs!
>
>Don Share, a poem echoing the Bishopian "House that Jack Built"
>structure, found his way to "the hurt of older houses" and "the
>pudge of Prozac." Yeah, my body too.
>
>Ed Skoog: "I count on this poem to investigate wrongdoing...reading this
>poem is like belonging to a group." Metapoetastic.
>
>Chuck Stebleton: "hemorraging talent" ("so much style and
>it's wasted") and "You put Ohio in my impromptu." And a
>hilarious line echoing Shakespeare: "if pubes be wool..."
>
>Mark Tardi, who confessed to be obsessed with nuclear waste disposal
>post-Chernobyl (aren't we all?): "roadsides favor
>promiscuity."
>
>Catherine Taylor: "the lyric's past seduction." That works in so many
>ways.
>
>Tony Trigilio: "They sound bells for us." And, about Rumsfeld's
>house: "the cameras in the Secretary's birdfeeders can see (?)
>them."
>
>Nick Twemlow: a Howl-esque tribute to his hometown of Topeka: "the black
>keys being Topeka...Topeka, the sickness will go unnoticed." Topeka is a
>song, isn't it?
>
>Quraysh Ali Lansana spun a tale of a slave named Jacob who finally escaped,
>because he loved the dogs more than the master: "the dogs never
>moved."
>
>Lina Ramona Vitkauskas, from a poem called "Erection: A Single
>Entendre." Somehow, the title was poetry enough. Thinking of the
>Spinanes's "Rummy": "the power of erection/the tallest building
>in Chicago."
>
>Barrett Watten, sampling Williams: "democracy is impossible and must be
>preserved." I could see the computer screen echoes in his eyeglasses.
>Somehow, that's a detail that seems right for the poet of exteriority.
>
>Tyrone Williams, taking a collage of SUN TIMES lines: "can you see me
>now/caption only." Caption only, as refrain.
>
>Tim Yu, bringing us home with an abecedarian: "the turning world
>gravitates on its absent stem....yowling unspeakable names to the zero of
>hearing."
>
>Thanks to all the readers and ears out there. Jennifer Moxley, among other
>poetry luminaries, was spotted...but not on the readers' list?! I should have
>ceded my time.
