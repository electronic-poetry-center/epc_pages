the need for fury among animals and others
two angel fish one dolphin one woman four skeletons one public monument
http://www.as.wvu.edu:8000/clc/Members/sondheim/totem.mov
but you'd better see
http://www.as.wvu.edu/clcold/sondheim/files/WolfTCs.mov
although the first is a quarter the second
and both reference undergrounds
and the need for fury of the most furious sort

"how am i doing"

how am i doing
you're doing fine, why do you ask
i don't think i'm doing fine, there are too many people against me
online or offline do you think
everywhere, there's no difference now, the world's increasingly porous,
just look around you, reality's a hack, online is open-real, reality is
open-source
you're upset about quantum mechanics
it's proprietary, depends on the economics, what you're looking at,
research programmes, that sort of thing
but you're doing fine
as long as i don't think about these things
and your work
piling bodies on one another, species, devouring landscapes
all this talk about your work
is meaningless when species are disappearing at such a furious rate
they're open source
they're closed source or open source, it depends on who they are, what
they want
you can't mean they're mouthing information
exactly that, meanwhile they say i write too much, that it's all the same
is it
not if you look closely, but every human has only one good idea and i've
had hundreds
can you name some
sure, neitherness, defuge, immersive-definable hierarchies, the ascii
unconscious, jectivity, the same old things
rubrics for other things, jettisoned language
or ideas i struggle to express, some unnamed, some in moving images,
video, motion picture, online directories fraught with peripheral
nomenclatures, one's peril, another's perl
so the pun
so the pun slips not from one register of language to another, but from
language to elsewhere, unspoken, the foundations shaken, as if there
weren't any, as if their lack were manifest on the surface
you're saying embroiled, roiling, boiling
or motile in a brownian fashion, quantum and irretrievable chaos
but back there on the surface they're talking about you
too much of it, yes, too much the same, not enough zing
they say you're a nice guy, too
preposterous poppycock of the fairways, assorted fructose, you get the
picture
the sweetness of it all
yes, the sweetness of it all

Yes, it looks MUCH like the previous experiment I did with dynamically generated images(it should, seeing as how it's built on the previous experiment's code); this one, however, relies on external data to decide how many (randomly-placed)solid lines, dashed lines, and randomly-colored pixels to use. The external data is generated from Yahoo stock quotes for Microsoft stock...

I would love to come to this reading, but alas I do not have a car, a
license, and I am pretty much flat broke (I could borrow money from my
parents, but my dad who is in the army does not support my activities). Are
there any good peops that are passing through North Carolina (particularly
Fayetteville) that could help a poet with a ride? Please respond off list
(obviously). I hear there is a poet in this town that is very well know
(that's the rumor)... does anyone know this poet and do they know if he
plans on attending (I could maybe catch a ride with him). I am not concerned
about a place to stay because I have family on Staten Island and a sleeping
bag. Just a ride ma'am, just a ride. Thanks if anyone can help and thanks if
you can't. Peace,
Ian VanHeusen

I fast talk speak & revolution
as if my life had always depended upon it, doors with hands have been
closing in Southern Midnights as if full of superstition
and I see a strong man from the next
and I see a deconstruction of heirarchy from a slang
but sometimes when all the eyes around you are on you
ya can't help wonder. Maybe,
this revolutionary thing is more powerfull than you thought
and through tough love ya learn
to only battle friends (even if they are only voices in an unforgiving
midnight)
& ya learn to stay postive and strong through all the shit

sometimes folks just gotta see
I've been fighting since birth
bright kid with maybe too many lights on
strait A's and tests, tests, tests
and through all of it, there was a mean teacher in the back
telling my parents too shut that kid up
put him on Ridilin, he's going bad
and in the worst case scenario, my desk was moved into a corner
and told to shut-up
I'm crazy, but I am not insane
I hear things everywhere I listen, and sometimes I wonder
is this real?
Maybe it's not
maybe it's just passages too something better
you see
I fast talk speak & revolution
as if I had been fighting the military state from birth
did ya know the guy's dad is in the Army
and that his mom calls him the devil
did ya know that he gave a woman a love letter
and watched as she ran scared from him
did ya know that priest's watch there words in front of him
like counting numbers in the sky
and in the center of it, this Krazy Cloud still says the same thing
Revolution Revolution Revolution
1 Thousand times, as if his life depended upon
this path as if it were a promise he made to his god.
Peace,
Ian VanHeusen

Saturday, June 26, 2004

If I missed a lot of good papers I managed to coax a few out of my
fellow colonists.  Tim Gray, who works at the College of Staten
Island with my friend Sarah Schulman, gave a paper on Morris Graves
that was excellent, showing not only the extent that his Graves'
painting influenced a range of West Coast painters, including
Rexroth, Ferlinghetti, Gary Snyder, William Everson, but also made a
call for a new way of looking at West Coast poetry that would
recognize painting as an integral part of the writing, the way we
interchange the poets and painters of the New York School.  I guess
for this argument to work you have to produce some powerful West
Coast painters and more and more Morris Graves had come into my
world, as Kylie Minogue might have said.  Tim had some super
handouts, Xeroxes of some Graves paintings that knocked my socks off.
Sometime in the early 50s Jack Spicer went to a Graves exhibition and
wrote "Hibernation" in tribute to Graves' painting with that title.

Hibernation-After Morris Graves

Deeper than sleep, but in a room as narrow
The mind turns off its longings one by one,
Lets beautiful black fingers snap the last one,
Remove the self and lie its body down.
The Future chills the sky above the chamber.
The Past gnaws through the earth below the bed.
But here the naked Present lies as warmly
As if it rested in the lap of God.

Happily Tim has established that Graves' "Hibernation" was painted in
Ireland in 1953-4, so there's no use assigning Spicer's tribute poem
to an earlier date than that, thank God for small mercies.  If anyone
is interested the new Clear Cut Anthology has a great memoir by
Wesley Wehr about his relationship with Graves, Mark Tobey, and other
leading lights of the Seattle school in the immediate post war
period.  Anyway that's one talk (part of a panel on "Poetry and the
War Resisters Internment Corps") that I'm sorry I missed.  All right
Tim.  (Since coming back from Maine, I've heard from Matthew Stadler
that Wesley Wehr died, very suddenly, and won't be finishing his
memoir of the period after all, though a lot of work was done on it.
Hopefully his papers will be transferred to some Northwestern
Archive, including the autobiographical writings.)

Later that Saturday night I asked Brian Reed what the feeling was in
Seattle about Graves and if there had been much interchange with
Theodore Roethke.  I liked meeting Reed quite a bit, he says he did
his graduate work at Stanford and even that I couldn't really hold
against him.  I was thinking to myself, of all the resources there in
the room!  But if I understood him correctly there are two camps in
Seattle and one of them holds that Roethke was the great creative
genius, the other goes for Graves, and that not a little of the
gay-straight split fuels the vociferousness of these two opinions.
Reed says you can actually visit Roethke's house, how weird is that.
Possibly you would get a sense about how and why the work was done
the way it was.  One time I got to prowl through the rank basement
apartment on California Street at Van Ness where Spicer wrote The
Holy Grail, and it all came alive to me in a way I hadn't
anticipated, I almost felt him tangibly, the outlines of a ghost,
maybe his.

Anyhow I began to think that what I wanted more of at this conference
was an account of how poetry and the visual arts influenced each
other in this decade.  There must have been enormous interchange, but
only rarely did I hear anything about it directly.  (Such as in Tim
Gray's paper.)  Maybe it's a San Francisco thing, our paradigmatic
couple being Robert Duncan, a poet, always paired with Jess Collins,
the painter, that we see things in this binary way that isn't really
the case elsewhere?  And indeed sometimes I get tired of always
hearing about the porousness of Duncan and Jess and how they were
really two sides of the same creative mind.  A little of that-I mean
a lot of that-goes a long way.  But elsewhere in the Conference I
found that most of the scholars were ignoring the visual arts big
time.

My own, 8:30 panel was called "The Northern California Poetry Scene
in the 1940s."  It featured a paper on the folklorist and
anthropologist Jaime de Angulo by Rick Seddon from New Mexico.  Rick
gave us a picture of De Angulo as "shaman-like but not a shaman," so
much was clear.  I did not realize that De Angulo was a medical
doctor from Johns Hopkins and isn't that where Gertrude Stein went to
school?  There's something I find antipathetic about De Angulo, and
maybe it's his western ways.  He didn't really seem to like anything
very much, and his letters are amusing for his lack of interest in
what the other person is all about.  He mentions to Pound in every
letter, "I have never read your poetry and I have never read any
poetry except for my own."  Seddon concentrated on the relations
between De Angulo and Robinson Jeffers, new material to me and (I
missed the dates) something that had occurred way back in the 1920s I
guess?

Kelly Holt, who is editing the Spicer letters with me, acted on a tip
Andrew Schelling passed along and re-covered a lot of interesting
material in the De Angulo papers at UC Santa Cruz, connecting De
Angulo with Spicer and Duncan in the immediate postwar period in
which Spicer studied informally with De Angulo in the spring of 1947
and in which, slightly later, Duncan became his secretary and typist
in the rough final period when he was basically wasting away from
cancer.  Between Duncan's "A Crissmuss Pome For Haimee," and Spicer's
"An Answer to Jaime," I get the picture that De Angelo's strangeness
and eccentricity provoked both poets; they don't seem really to have
cared for him all that much, perhaps he was too strange?  (Duncan
later spoke of De Angulo as being a pioneer of the transgender
movement, as the drugs he took for his illness, hormonal in nature,
gave him certain opposite-sex characteristic which blended bizarrely
with his he-man image.  It was his exposure as a nurse to these same
drugs that encouraged the GI who became Christine Jorgensen to
continue down the path towards becoming a woman, at roughly the same
period.)  If De Angulo encouraged the young poets of Berkeley to
secede California from the rest of the world, I don't know if he
helped them or hurt them.  Duncan's "Crissmuss Pome" (which is in
manuscript at the De Angulo papers) must be from 1948?  Its very
first word is "Wallace," and it sure isn't Wallace Stevens.  (Maybe
that's coy, of course I mean it's an allusion to the socialist
candidate Henry Wallace who ran in the 1948 election.)

Wallace yawk yawk yawk
Yawk Russia yawk yawk
yawk yawk freedom of yawk yawk
he's a fashist [sic] yawk yawk

Kimberly Bird, the young woman who had interviewed Carl Rakosi at
length for Cal's Oral History Project, gave an interesting talk on
Kenneth Rexroth and his movement away from broad-based social causes
into a more private, domestic poetry during the course of the 1940s,
mirroring to a great extent the "privatization" of US poetry as a
whole.  What the paper did was exemplary, linking the isolated
project of one atypical American poet with that of the nation, and
testing the theory in various ways.  Smart, savvy, and very chic, La
Bird "came to the conference with her mother!" one young fellow
whispered to me, speaking for a whole slew of amorous horndogs who,
blown away by Bird's exquisite, California good looks, had flattered
themselves into perhaps believing they might really have had a chance
with her if only she hadn't brought along her mother as cicerone.
What men will believe!  I didn't get to meet the mother myself.  But
I hope this will start a trend and I can meet more parents of
scholars, survey their puzzlement and pride.

My own contribution to the panel was a diminished one because I had
originally hoped to "present" with Peter Gizzi, who as it turned out
couldn't come after all.  We were calling the talk, "Editing Jack
Spicer," and my allocation of the talk clocked in at about 9 minutes.
To fill out the remainder of the time I widened the talk to announce
some recent discoveries we have made, and read from a poem, "Night
shades crawl," which we have found inside a book which Spicer is now
believed to have worked on as a ghostwriter, a novel published by a
"mainstream press" as they say, in the year 1961.  (The exact extent
of Spicer's help on his pal's novel has yet to be determined or
confirmed.)  The novel's ostensible author is still alive,
apparently, and I wonder if I could get him to talk about it for the
record.  My readers will appreciate how delicate such an interview
would be . . .   Gee, Mr. X, did you really pay Jack Spicer fifty
dollars to write a whole novel for you?

Well, we'll see.  Certainly I've asked questions more indelicate yet.
Also I mentioned the possibility that Spicer's 1964 poem, "A redwood
forest is not invisible at night," might also come from another
sequence besides "Thing Language" in which it was published in 1965
(LANGUAGE).  I'm getting the feeling that Spicer worked
simultaneously at several different projects, and that any particular
lyric might have been used to fit a hole in a sequence, though not
necessarily intended originally as part of that sequence-i.e., a more
workmanlike approach to poesis than the "dictated" seer that Blaser
has written about in "The Practice to Outside," the afterword to the
1975 edition of the COLLECTED BOOKS OF JACK SPICER.

It would have been a better presentation with Peter in it, but c'est
la vie!  Afterwards several consulted me with suggestions about what
to do with my editing problems.  Steve Shoemaker talked about the
visionary editing practice of Jerome McGann at the University of
Virginia-and he wasn't the only one.  Steve Fredman was very
supportive and helpful.

At this point in my notes, which I transcribed from notes I wrote on
my jeans, I see that Wallace Stevens somewhere said, "In the face of
an overwhelming actuality, consciousness takes the place of the
imagination."  Was this something J. Hillis Miller shared with me?
Or was it someone in the audience at my panel?  I wrote the word AIDS
next to the quote, thinking, what?  That this was the overwhelming
actuality that had occurred in my lifetime.  Had consciousness then
taken the place of the imagination, I can't decide.  Sometimes I
think yes, sometimes no.

Following my paper I went to another plenary to hear Alan Filreis
from the Kelly Writers House in Philadelphia talking about "Modernism
and Anticommunism in the 1940s."  His paper was always amusing and
filled with good jokes.  Basically he had found an amazing trove of
anti-Communist material which suggested that, in the minds of many
poets and scholars of the postwar period, Communism had infiltrated
Modernism and that it was time to throw the baby out with the
bathwater.  Thus there were a number of "Purity Leagues" and "Red
Squads" among the poetry world, magazines determined to wipe out
modernism and return poetry to its Georgian roots.  Filreis quoted
from many editorials and also the private correspondence of  the
magazine editors.  They weren't all dopes either, he made that clear,
the way that Whittaker Chambers was no dope and actually did know
quite a lot about poetry.  These guys were determined to get rid of
Modernism and they nearly did, at least in the 1950s they had thinned
it out to a mere white paste of Robert Frost and Scott Fitzgerald and
other "safe" writers they could parade around on State Department
money and brag that the US always respected the rights of
intellectuals.  Ha!  And he (Al Filreis) had penetrated the archives
of Poetry Magazine and seen how Jackson Mac Low had often submitted
his work to them, and he'd seen the internal memos on the sides of
Jackson's query letter and the handwriting was like (I paraphrase)
"Don't print anything by this Communist agent."

Then I had lunch with Alan Gilbert.  No, first Carla Billittieri
drove me and Alan back to her house in Old Town, because Alan needed
to pick up the slides he had prepared for his lecture.  I first met
Carla in Orono, I bet she didn't have an inkling of an idea that one
day she would be living there permanently!  She is brilliant, chic,
and very tough, and says what she thinks which I always appreciate.
I must have looked tired because as soon as we were inside her place,
she's all like, Kevin come in and sit down and what would you like to
eat?  I said that me and Alan were going out to eat.  Yes but, she
insisted, sit down now.  We sat around the kitchen table and Carla
pulled out a big tub of blueberries, big as scarabs.  She said in
Maine they're cheap, like candy in Mexico City.

Was reading this interview with Brad Senning in a
recent Potomac and wondered if anyone knows a
sourcebook for plot devices. It seems that something
interesting is being said here, I'm just missing the
basics.

Aside from that, can anybody point me to fiction
writers doing interesting things nowadays with plot?
I'm hearing about Pynchon here for the first time.
Godard? Beckett? There's so much yet to read.

Coby Tucker



The traditional love story has a part where two people
meet, then a conflict, then a resolution. If it’s a
twisted love story, three people meet instead of two.
If it’s a comedy, there’s a conflict, resolution,
conflict, resolution, conflict, resolution, etc. If
you’re going to write a comedy sketch, you’ve gotta
have some rat feces in there. These are hard and fast
rules. The trick is telling a story that follows the
effects of a formula without following the formula
itself. Or not the trick, but the preoccupation, it
seems. Or I don’t know if it’s preoccupation, but
people certainly think about it a lot. Film-makers,
writers and artists. All seem to work from within,
while reacting against, time-honored formulas. It
could be inverting the formula (Godard did everything
the film academy said he couldn’t do—close-ups with a
wide-angle lens, shooting action against a white
background), or evading the formula (Beckett teased
audiences with a plot that never moved forward). But
no matter how good an artist is, the formula is still
there in some trace form or another. The conflict in a
Thomas Pynchon love story may be a man wondering if
the woman he’s seeing allows other men to put a finger
in her anus, but it’s a conflict all the same.

For me, it was around the time I started getting a
series of past due notices in the mail that I realized
plot is a series of attention-grabbing moments. This
is the formula I’m most interested in, and I will
continue to not pay my bills if only to study it. It
may be that the plot is the place where the motives of
the characters and the motives of the story converge,
but it’s also simply the story’s repeated focus. As
when staring at a shape for awhile means the shape
goes everywhere you look. In a detective story, the
clues the private eye uncovers in a steadily revealed
plot are symbolic repetitions of the original murder,
and the story maintains its plot by way of this
repetition. Similarly, in a Hitchcock film, the plot
to poison someone is illustrated by showing a close-up
of the drink, then a still shot of the drink, then a
shot of two people talking tensely through the cavity
of the glass. So that repetition is the key ingredient
in the suggestion of plot.

As soon as I realized this, I began to write very
short pieces in which a repeated word or phrase would
create the same effect as a traditional plot. As for
resolution in a story like this, I mean it to have
more like a “resolution effect,” as when a man and a
woman having a fight are next seen having sex. A
resolution, as when the fat lady sings or the cannons
go off in the symphony hall, is not so much real as
understood, through expectations of closure as much as
anything else. And right now this is a fun thing to
play with. Whether or not I can sustain something like
this for an entire novel about breakfast, there are a
lot of questions about whether the subject of
breakfast is worth a novel. Or whether or not ten days
from now I’ll be interested in lunch. In the meantime,
I’m eating a lot, because I believe in researching my topics.

Interesting that you pluck the word "boring" from the last paragraph of my

Oh Roger, this is sad. I have noticed, over the years, what a nice guy you
are, but I am not looking for sympathy, I simply can't raise any of these
issues on brit-based fora because I've become effectively gagged on them by
people from overseas, for the most part. I am not nationalistic, am devoid
of racism, have impeccable left-wing credentials, but find myself getting
caricatured as some kind of mad nationalist by members of the literary
bourgeoisie. To talk in the English style, I am seriously  pissed off by
this. Various people can do predictable double acts to screw me up, but
that
it seems is ok,  bollocks can be put out as representing left-wing views
(it's ok, they mean nothing, say the powers that be)  and in the meantime
....

well I dunno, there's this sort of space!

btw a lot of the boring writers in A Chide's Alphabet are on this list so
maybe you could tell them how dull they are.

To be clear about my part. I suggested that you should raise these issues
in a British forum because there, in all possibility, you would at least
get some sympathy.  And, lo and behold, it's as I predicted: all you've
gained so far is some well deserved opprobrium, modulo the invisible
back-channelers of course. In fact, Alan seems to be strenghthened by the
renewed interest you've stirred - and may the force be with him, I say. You
seem to have acted as a marketing agent for Alan - very generous of you, if
I may say so. Sadly, it has left me with the feeling that someone who I had
hitherto respected, seems to have come up with a streak of wooliness.
Although, with a few exceptions, I never wholly liked  the content of
chides whatsits, it seemed a worthy endeavour and well produced.

As to the Brit forums, well, what can I say. You seem to have laden
yourself with a passle of hassle, if I may say so. But, really, I couldn't
give two hoots. However, I also suggested that you complain directly to
tRace but they wouldn't, in all probability, give you a hearing either. I
wouldn't really blame them either, given that you go around dissing them in
public. Barring the Daily Mail - have you tried writing to them? - there
is, I suppose, another way: tRace's funders, who are, in all likelihood,
the English Arts Council, but you'd have to do some legwork to ascertain
this. At a guess, tRace's funders  might - if you presented a substantial
case - give you a decent hearing. But hey, this is what *I* would do if I
wanted to do something about it.

But, as Robin says,  enough already. This wearied me the first time round.
Now it's just boring.

Roger.

Hi Rob

isn't this all complicated!? My suspicion is that most of these matters
arise from mistake, not deliberate venom, although sometimes one cannot be
quite sure. Roger Day, quite innocently I am sure, suggested that I should
raise these matters about arts funding in our local region on a certain
British based list, while Rebecca Seifeirle followed up with remarks about
my posts being screened there, whereas the truth of the matter is, although
my posts are under review, for reasons that are not quite explicable, as
you
know, nothing I post to that list, of +any+ nature, will appear as both
list
owners seem to have gone into absentia so I might as well be talking into a
black hole. It sort of undermines the logic of review status if nobody's
reviewing the posts. This kind of death by silence is what seems to
characterise the UK arts scene but one is never quite sure whether the
murders are deliberate or not. But, I can say with certainty, that only a
small number of people have access to the 'pot' here, one sees the same
names crop up again and again, they are not necessarily the best writers in
the region, I can think of many gifted people who are completely shut out,
but they, the ever recurring names that is,  are the most adept are
manipulating funding. Alan's unfortunate remarks about Incubation were so
way off the mark - of course I don't have hard copies of the mag - but also
Incubation costs a fortune to attend - a little fact that Alan omits to
mention.
I've long gone past being angry about all this stuff, just miserably
resigned to reality.

From here among the what one must not mention

Best

There have been three issues of A Chide's Alphabet, all originally virtual
and only Chide1 is available in hardcopy.

(Anyone who wants a (hard)copy of Chide1 backchannel me -- I've got plenty.

It's not dave's fault that Chides 2 and 3 never made hardcopy -- entirely
due to my incompetance.)

There's a problem-of-communication when it comes to discussing the
structural funding of poetry in USAmerica and Britain (and even that needs
to be unteased, given that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
{add in Eire} differ quite considerably.  Leave aside Canada, Australia and
New Zealand, to mention only a few).

The name of the game in the US is MFA -- simply doesn't exist here, or not
enough to make a living from.

Early on, I decided that there were only two ways to play the funding
game -- you did it seriously, and I admire the ones who can do this.

... or you took no money from ANYONE.

I'm not sure at what point it became feasible to print your own book or
magazine, run a publishing house on peanuts.

Maybe about five years ago when technology encountered the fading rose, and
all you had to do was lash together a laser printer, a copy of Word, and a
Dahle 515 guillotine.

A tube of PVA glue and a blunt knife to score the covers.

The only complicated bit I found with this was working-out the algorithm
for
paginating in Word if you were doing double-sided printing.

So, OK, i confess to a bit of special interest here -- I don't like TrAce,
which always struck me, though I'm assuredly biased, as a pack of wittering
third-rate Nottingham-Trent academics playing ego games.

And I've published a fair bit in _The Coffee House_, which does get money
from EMA.

So when it comes to the East Midlands debacle, I'm probably the absolute
pig-in-the-middle.

Enough, already.

"It seems to me that the most important thing in making art is courage.
With the Blueprint Series, we are trying to provide an arena where that can
take place." ~ Richard Foreman

THE ONTOLOGICAL THEATER PRESENTS THE TWELFTH ANNUAL OBIE-AWARD WINNING
 BLUEPRINT SERIES
A CELEBRATION OF EXPERIMENTAL THEATER DIRECTORS. AUGUST 4TH  THROUGH AUGUST
15TH=20

Every summer, The Ontological-Hysteric Theater takes great pleasure in
introducing the New York theater community to four exciting and innovative
new artists. This year is no different. We once again bring you  The
Blueprint Series, our annual forum for theatrical exploration and
experimentation. The Blueprint Series is a forum for directors to create,
interact, and learn from one another. Working together, the artists push
each other to discover their own unique theatrical voices.
We are proud to finally unveil the four directors who will make up The 12th
annual Blueprint Series. The 2004 directors are Kenneth Collins, Sam Hunter=
,
Beth Kurkjian, and Keith Mayerson. Chosen by Artistic Director Richard
Foreman and curators Joshua Briggs and Brian PJ Cronin, the directors will
present four 40 minute works running in repertory.  The festival runs
Wednesdays through Sundays, from August 4th  through August 15th, at 8:00pm
at the Ontological Theater, located at Saint Mark's Church at the corner of
Second Avenue and 10th Street. For information and reservations call (212)
533-4650. =20

In Contingent, Kenneth Collins presents the second in his series of "box
projects," this time using David Markson=B9s Reader=B9s Block for inspiration.
Sam Hunter=B9s Abraham (A Shot in the Head) re-explores a Biblical tale with
the reminder that together, Christians and Muslims comprise roughly 55% of
the world's population. In Crochet: I Dream Ballet., Beth Kurkjian uses
fairytales, senior citizen line-dancing and bridal showers to ask the
question: who will win the tetherball match? And in Keith Mayerson=B9s A Chil=
d
is Being Beaten, individual agency is brought into question as Girl, Woman,
Postman, Bobby, and the mysterious narrator interact with one another in
startling ways.

Contingent=20
Directed by Kenneth Collins
=20
Contingent is the second in a series of "box projects".  In this minimalist
chamber theater experiment, performers are isolated in large wooden boxes,
with just enough room to stand in. The boxes are lined inside with
fluorescent lights for illumination and the text is performed entirely over
microphones from inside the box, behind its plexiglass  front.

Kenneth Sean Collins  is the Artistic Director of the experimental
performance group Temporary distortion (www.temporarydistortion.com). For
the past seven years,  his focus has been on the development of small
multidisciplinary chamber-like performance pieces, utilizing unique
nonlinear juxtapositions of text, image, and sound.  He is also a part of
the administrative staff at the Lincoln Center Theater and a member of the
Lincoln Center Theater Directors Lab.

Abraham (A Shot in the Head)
Written and Directed by Sam Hunter
With Original Music by Ben Hunter

Here I am.  There are over three and twenty six million cubic miles of wate=
r
on the Earth.  There are over 2 billion Christians.  There are over 1.3
billion Muslims.  There are a bit over 1 million neo-Pagans.  The Crusades
claimed somewhere between two and five million lives.  The estimated
civilian death toll in the current Iraq war is somewhere between nine and
twelve thousand and rising.  Here I am.

Sam Hunter grew up in Moscow, Idaho before moving to New York in 2000 to
attend NYU, where he has just received his BFA in Playwriting.  He has been
produced twice at Manhattan Theatre Source (in 2003 with "Radioplay" and
again in 2004 with "American Triptych") and has had several staged readings
of his newest full length play, "Norman Rockwell Killed My Father".  In the
Fall he will begin working toward his MFA in Playwriting at the Iowa
Playwright=B9s Workshop.  He is a recipient of a John Golden Playwriting Priz=
e
and an Iowa Arts Fellowship.

Crochet: I Dream Ballet
Written and directed by Beth Kurkjian

Crochet: I Dream Ballet explores intimate and bizarre cross-sections of
female youth and senescence.  This dream ballet is filled with splintered
movement and text; the costumes and set pieces are crocheted in baby blanke=
t
hues. Material has been inspired by fairytales, senior citizen line-dancing=
,
bridal showers, and the performers=B9 own experiences.  Who will win the
tetherball match?


Beth Kurkjian has performed in NYC in: I cancan 2, a duet choreographed and
performed by Johanna Meyer (The Kitchen); Cape Cod, a solo performance
(Ontological); Lapse by Ken Nintzel (Whitney/Altria, PS 122); Saint Latrice
by Juliana Francis (PS 122); non/fiction, a solo performance (PS 122);
Pickford, a one-woman show (Ontological); Centaur Feat, a solo performance
(Ontological, five myles, Phat Tuesdays); Pageant by Ken Nintzel
(Ontological & HERE); Tilly Losch and The Field of Mars (GAle GAtes).  In
Kirsten Kearse=B9s short film, Horsefingers, she played Emma.  Beth is a PhD
student in the Performance Studies Department at NYU.


A Child is Being Beaten
Written and Directed by Keith Mayerson

A Child Is Being Beaten is a dark comedy about the nuclear family with
themes of apocalypse, elegy, carnivalesque all wrapped up in one giant
enchilada, hard to bite into but juicy and fulfilling in the center. The
first act of a two part play, the crunchy core of the narrative will be sur=
e
to delight and inspire, shock and awe, repulse and engage.
  =20
Keith Mayerson is an artist and playwright living in New York City.  His
artwork, narrative based paintings and drawings based on plays and
screenplays hung like storyboards, stain-glassed windows, or comics, have
been shown in  one-person shows at Derek Eller Gallery and Jay Gorney Moder=

I noticed I'd transposed the 'boring' epithet a little while after the
message was posted but by then my e-mail had locked up for a while and other
things distracted, da-dah-dee-da. It is interesting how about the way e-mail
conversations are taken (or mistaken) - I hold very much to the notion that
the form is a hybrid of the written and the spoken, pardon the lack of
definition in the terms, so that people often write e-mail as if they were
talking face-to-face and also read it so, the result is that discussions
that would cause no problems face-to-face become distorted via the
legislative authority of the written.

Hope this makes some sense!

Oh Roger, this is sad. I have noticed, over the years, what a nice guy you
are, but I am not looking for sympathy, I simply can't raise any of these
issues on brit-based fora because I've become effectively gagged on them by
people from overseas, for the most part. I am not nationalistic, am devoid
of racism, have impeccable left-wing credentials, but find myself getting
caricatured as some kind of mad nationalist by members of the literary
bourgeoisie. To talk in the English style, I am seriously  pissed off by
this. Various people can do predictable double acts to screw me up, but
that
it seems is ok,  bollocks can be put out as representing left-wing views
(it's ok, they mean nothing, say the powers that be)  and in the meantime
....

well I dunno, there's this sort of space!

btw a lot of the boring writers in A Chide's Alphabet are on this list so
maybe you could tell them how dull they are.

To be clear about my part. I suggested that you should raise these issues
in a British forum because there, in all possibility, you would at least
get some sympathy.  And, lo and behold, it's as I predicted: all you've
gained so far is some well deserved opprobrium, modulo the invisible
back-channelers of course. In fact, Alan seems to be strenghthened by the
renewed interest you've stirred - and may the force be with him, I say. You
seem to have acted as a marketing agent for Alan - very generous of you, if
I may say so. Sadly, it has left me with the feeling that someone who I had
hitherto respected, seems to have come up with a streak of wooliness.
Although, with a few exceptions, I never wholly liked  the content of
chides whatsits, it seemed a worthy endeavour and well produced.

As to the Brit forums, well, what can I say. You seem to have laden
yourself with a passle of hassle, if I may say so. But, really, I couldn't
give two hoots. However, I also suggested that you complain directly to
tRace but they wouldn't, in all probability, give you a hearing either. I
wouldn't really blame them either, given that you go around dissing them in
public. Barring the Daily Mail - have you tried writing to them? - there
is, I suppose, another way: tRace's funders, who are, in all likelihood,
the English Arts Council, but you'd have to do some legwork to ascertain
this. At a guess, tRace's funders  might - if you presented a substantial
case - give you a decent hearing. But hey, this is what *I* would do if I
wanted to do something about it.

But, as Robin says,  enough already. This wearied me the first time round.
Now it's just boring.

Roger.

Hi Rob

isn't this all complicated!? My suspicion is that most of these matters
arise from mistake, not deliberate venom, although sometimes one cannot be
quite sure. Roger Day, quite innocently I am sure, suggested that I should
raise these matters about arts funding in our local region on a certain
British based list, while Rebecca Seifeirle followed up with remarks about
my posts being screened there, whereas the truth of the matter is, although
my posts are under review, for reasons that are not quite explicable, as
you
know, nothing I post to that list, of +any+ nature, will appear as both
list
owners seem to have gone into absentia so I might as well be talking into a
black hole. It sort of undermines the logic of review status if nobody's
reviewing the posts. This kind of death by silence is what seems to
characterise the UK arts scene but one is never quite sure whether the
murders are deliberate or not. But, I can say with certainty, that only a
small number of people have access to the 'pot' here, one sees the same
names crop up again and again, they are not necessarily the best writers in
the region, I can think of many gifted people who are completely shut out,
but they, the ever recurring names that is,  are the most adept are
manipulating funding. Alan's unfortunate remarks about Incubation were so
way off the mark - of course I don't have hard copies of the mag - but also
Incubation costs a fortune to attend - a little fact that Alan omits to
mention.
I've long gone past being angry about all this stuff, just miserably
resigned to reality.

From here among the what one must not mention

Best

There have been three issues of A Chide's Alphabet, all originally virtual
and only Chide1 is available in hardcopy.

(Anyone who wants a (hard)copy of Chide1 backchannel me -- I've got plenty.

It's not dave's fault that Chides 2 and 3 never made hardcopy -- entirely
due to my incompetance.)

There's a problem-of-communication when it comes to discussing the
structural funding of poetry in USAmerica and Britain (and even that needs
to be unteased, given that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
{add in Eire} differ quite considerably.  Leave aside Canada, Australia and
New Zealand, to mention only a few).

The name of the game in the US is MFA -- simply doesn't exist here, or not
enough to make a living from.

Early on, I decided that there were only two ways to play the funding
game -- you did it seriously, and I admire the ones who can do this.

... or you took no money from ANYONE.

I'm not sure at what point it became feasible to print your own book or
magazine, run a publishing house on peanuts.

Maybe about five years ago when technology encountered the fading rose, and
all you had to do was lash together a laser printer, a copy of Word, and a
Dahle 515 guillotine.

A tube of PVA glue and a blunt knife to score the covers.

The only complicated bit I found with this was working-out the algorithm
for
paginating in Word if you were doing double-sided printing.

So, OK, i confess to a bit of special interest here -- I don't like TrAce,
which always struck me, though I'm assuredly biased, as a pack of wittering
third-rate Nottingham-Trent academics playing ego games.

And I've published a fair bit in _The Coffee House_, which does get money
from EMA.

So when it comes to the East Midlands debacle, I'm probably the absolute
pig-in-the-middle.

Enough, already.

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and =
that language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that =
we can experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step =
outside our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and =
taverns!), utilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and =
invented forms. We will explore the structural possibilities of language =
to ultimately answer the question: How does form serve content? Both =
beginning and practiced poets will generate lots of original writing =
from this full day of language play and experimentation, and will bring =
home a fresh eye with which to revisit old poems stuck in the draft =
stage.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught =
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson =
Literary Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of =
the Arts, Mad Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled =
notspeak.

I noticed I'd transposed the 'boring' epithet a little while after the
message was posted but by then my e-mail had locked up for a while and
other
things distracted, da-dah-dee-da. It is interesting how about the way
e-mail
conversations are taken (or mistaken) - I hold very much to the notion that
the form is a hybrid of the written and the spoken, pardon the lack of
definition in the terms, so that people often write e-mail as if they were
talking face-to-face and also read it so, the result is that discussions
that would cause no problems face-to-face become distorted via the
legislative authority of the written.

Hope this makes some sense!

Oh Roger, this is sad. I have noticed, over the years, what a nice guy you
are, but I am not looking for sympathy, I simply can't raise any of these
issues on brit-based fora because I've become effectively gagged on them by
people from overseas, for the most part. I am not nationalistic, am devoid
of racism, have impeccable left-wing credentials, but find myself getting
caricatured as some kind of mad nationalist by members of the literary
bourgeoisie. To talk in the English style, I am seriously  pissed off by
this. Various people can do predictable double acts to screw me up, but
that
it seems is ok,  bollocks can be put out as representing left-wing views
(it's ok, they mean nothing, say the powers that be)  and in the meantime
....

well I dunno, there's this sort of space!

btw a lot of the boring writers in A Chide's Alphabet are on this list so
maybe you could tell them how dull they are.

To be clear about my part. I suggested that you should raise these issues
in a British forum because there, in all possibility, you would at least
get some sympathy.  And, lo and behold, it's as I predicted: all you've
gained so far is some well deserved opprobrium, modulo the invisible
back-channelers of course. In fact, Alan seems to be strenghthened by the
renewed interest you've stirred - and may the force be with him, I say. You
seem to have acted as a marketing agent for Alan - very generous of you, if
I may say so. Sadly, it has left me with the feeling that someone who I had
hitherto respected, seems to have come up with a streak of wooliness.
Although, with a few exceptions, I never wholly liked  the content of
chides whatsits, it seemed a worthy endeavour and well produced.

As to the Brit forums, well, what can I say. You seem to have laden
yourself with a passle of hassle, if I may say so. But, really, I couldn't
give two hoots. However, I also suggested that you complain directly to
tRace but they wouldn't, in all probability, give you a hearing either. I
wouldn't really blame them either, given that you go around dissing them in
public. Barring the Daily Mail - have you tried writing to them? - there
is, I suppose, another way: tRace's funders, who are, in all likelihood,
the English Arts Council, but you'd have to do some legwork to ascertain
this. At a guess, tRace's funders  might - if you presented a substantial
case - give you a decent hearing. But hey, this is what *I* would do if I
wanted to do something about it.

But, as Robin says,  enough already. This wearied me the first time round.
Now it's just boring.

Roger.

Hi Rob

isn't this all complicated!? My suspicion is that most of these matters
arise from mistake, not deliberate venom, although sometimes one cannot be
quite sure. Roger Day, quite innocently I am sure, suggested that I should
raise these matters about arts funding in our local region on a certain
British based list, while Rebecca Seifeirle followed up with remarks about
my posts being screened there, whereas the truth of the matter is, although
my posts are under review, for reasons that are not quite explicable, as
you
know, nothing I post to that list, of +any+ nature, will appear as both
list
owners seem to have gone into absentia so I might as well be talking into a
black hole. It sort of undermines the logic of review status if nobody's
reviewing the posts. This kind of death by silence is what seems to
characterise the UK arts scene but one is never quite sure whether the
murders are deliberate or not. But, I can say with certainty, that only a
small number of people have access to the 'pot' here, one sees the same
names crop up again and again, they are not necessarily the best writers in
the region, I can think of many gifted people who are completely shut out,
but they, the ever recurring names that is,  are the most adept are
manipulating funding. Alan's unfortunate remarks about Incubation were so
way off the mark - of course I don't have hard copies of the mag - but also
Incubation costs a fortune to attend - a little fact that Alan omits to
mention.
I've long gone past being angry about all this stuff, just miserably
resigned to reality.

From here among the what one must not mention

Best

Dave

There have been three issues of A Chide's Alphabet, all originally virtual
and only Chide1 is available in hardcopy.

(Anyone who wants a (hard)copy of Chide1 backchannel me -- I've got plenty.

It's not dave's fault that Chides 2 and 3 never made hardcopy -- entirely
due to my incompetance.)

There's a problem-of-communication when it comes to discussing the
structural funding of poetry in USAmerica and Britain (and even that needs
to be unteased, given that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
{add in Eire} differ quite considerably.  Leave aside Canada, Australia and
New Zealand, to mention only a few).

The name of the game in the US is MFA -- simply doesn't exist here, or not
enough to make a living from.

Early on, I decided that there were only two ways to play the funding
game -- you did it seriously, and I admire the ones who can do this.

... or you took no money from ANYONE.

I'm not sure at what point it became feasible to print your own book or
magazine, run a publishing house on peanuts.

Maybe about five years ago when technology encountered the fading rose, and
all you had to do was lash together a laser printer, a copy of Word, and a
Dahle 515 guillotine.

A tube of PVA glue and a blunt knife to score the covers.

The only complicated bit I found with this was working-out the algorithm
for
paginating in Word if you were doing double-sided printing.

So, OK, i confess to a bit of special interest here -- I don't like TrAce,
which always struck me, though I'm assuredly biased, as a pack of wittering
third-rate Nottingham-Trent academics playing ego games.

And I've published a fair bit in _The Coffee House_, which does get money
from EMA.

So when it comes to the East Midlands debacle, I'm probably the absolute
pig-in-the-middle.

Enough, already.

RIO RANCHO SCHOOL DISTRICT SETTLES FIRST AMENDMENT LAWSUIT WITH ALBUQUERQUE
POETRY TEACHER BILL NEVINS

Albuquerque, NM--Attorney Eric Sirotkin of Albuquerque announced today that
the Federal First Amendment law suit he filed in September, 2003 on behalf
of teacher Bill Nevins against the Rio Rancho (NM) School District has been
settled. The settlement included a payment of $205,000.00 to Nevins and his
attorney.

The facts established during discovery in this case were that Bill Nevins,
an Albuquerque poet, journalist, teacher, and teachers union (NEA-AFT)
member, had created "a marketplace of ideas" in his Rio Rancho (NM) High
School humanities classes and through the multicultural Write Club and
Poetry Team which he organized and coached at the school administration's
request in 2002-2003. Students, many of whom were "at-risk" challenged
students and from cultural minorities, wrote and performed their original
poems at school and in community poetry readings, with Nevins'
encouragement. The students and Nevins were widely praised. Then, in late
February, 2003, on the eve of the start of the Iraq War, one of Nevins's
team members read over the school's televised public address system an
original poem, "Revolution X", which contained criticism of US government
spending priorities concerning education and war. The high school's Militar=
y
Liaison complained to the principal and demanded action, indicating in
writing that whoever authorized the reading of the poem should be
"horsewhipped".

The student's poem was investigated by the RRHS administration and members
of the poetry team were called in and questioned. A campus censorship polic=
y
was put in place that banned the reading of poetry over the address system
and required teachers to screen both students and visiting authors for
"controversial" views. Bill Nevins openly questioned that policy and
encouraged his students to continue to read their poetry publicly. He was
abruptly suspended from coaching and teaching in March, 2003, at a time whe=
n
President Bush declared, "You're either with us or against us". Nevins was
banned from the RRHS campus and never permitted to return to teaching there=
.
In media interviews, Nevins challenged the school administration's actions
towards him, students and the club as an affront to freedom of speech and a
chilling of student creative expression. In May, 2003 Nevins was informed
that his teaching contract would not be renewed. The school allowed one
uncensored poem to be rea d at a flag raising ceremony that said Othose who
stand for peace shut your faces.

Following Nevins's removal, the RRHS Poetry Team disbanded, and to date no
such team has been reinstated, as no faculty member has been willing to ste=
p
forward and sponsor it. As one student lamented =B3they seem to afraid.

In September 2003, National Lawyers Guild attorney Eric Sirotkin, of
Albuquerque, filed the case in court, claiming violations of Nevins's
Constitutional rights. Nevins's case has received national and internationa=
l
media attention. A series of benefit poetry and music concerts were held
across the USA in support of Nevins's free speech struggle, including a Jul=
y
3 Independence Weekend show at New York's Bowery Poetry Club and shows in
Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico and in New England. Support for
Nevins's cause came in from the international writers' organization PEN,
from the National Writers Union (of which Nevins is a member) and from
dozens of prominent writers, in New Mexico and elsewhere, including
folksinger Utah Phillips, Filipina novelist Jessica Hagedorn, songwriter
Jenny Bird, poet Demetria Martinez, Cajun recording star Zachary Richard,
rockers Larry Kirwan, Chris Byrne and Tuli Kupferberg and slam poetry heroe=
s
Saul Williams and Bob Holman. The NYC Irish-ro ck band The Ruffians played =
a
special concert to back Nevins, and messages of support have come in from
Australia, Europe, Latin America and Africa.

The experience of being a living symbol of defense of American
Constitutional freedoms was made especially poignant for Nevins by the fact
that his son has been a US Army soldier serving in combat in both
Afghanistan and Iraq throughout the period of Nevins' prolonged struggle
here in New Mexico.

Attached are statements from Bill Nevins and His attorney. Nevins states
that he is looking into establishing a foundation to encourage freedom of
speech and that he intends to continue to encourage young poets to write an=
d
speak out freely. A special program for Young Poets arising out of the
settlement will be announced at the Conference. _ _ _

STATEMENTS

July 30, 2004

"The positive resolution of my case with Rio Rancho School District brings =
a
sense of relief that the Constitutional right to freedom of speech and the
redress of grievances has been reaffirmed.

I hope that this positive resolution will foster in our schools the spirit
of a marketplace of free exchange of ideas and opinions which was present i=
n
my classes and in the Write Club and Poetry Team at Rio Rancho High School.

I hope that students and teachers will be encouraged.

I hope that the youthful voices of poetry, and the voices of the
disadvantaged, the dissident and the dispossessed among us will continue to
sing out without fear of censorship and intimidation, in Rio Rancho,
throughout New Mexico, and everywhere. I pray that those voices may lead us
all towards lasting justice and peace.

I note that even the Rio Rancho High military liaison, in the course of
discovery for this case, stated that he had undergone a change in attitude
in the face of the losses we have suffered in the Iraq War. People can
change, and change can be for the good.

When I think of those of my students, especially those who are people of
color and those who come from less financially-favored homes, I am filled
with joyful memories of their writings and of their outspoken words raised
to be heard in the Write Club and Poetry Team. I am filled with sadness to
think that their voices could have been ignored or silenced by those in
power and by those charged with their educational care.

I do believe that such students inevitably will speak out, will sing out,
again. They shall not be silenced.

As the great African-American poet Langston Hughes wrote in his poem,
"Democracy": "Democracy will not come today, this year, nor ever, through
compromise and fear. Freedom is a strong seed planted in a great need."

May that seed of freedom keep growing here in New Mexico."

-- Bill Nevins _ _ _

This case is a victory for teachers everywhere who, in the current climate
of fear, have grown silent in the face of censorship and calls for blind
patriotism. Our nation=B9s greatest achievements have often come from those
who dissented and were willing to question the status quo.

Students are our future. Bill Nevins provided a forum for students to
express themselves and question the world around them. To progress as a
nation, we need more teachers willing to approach the central and often mos=
t
controversial issues of our day without fear of retribution.

I hope this case can empower teachers, and send a message to students that
there is justice -- even in the most trying of times.

RIO RANCHO SCHOOL DISTRICT SETTLES FIRST AMENDMENT LAWSUIT WITH ALBUQUERQUE
POETRY TEACHER BILL NEVINS

Albuquerque, NM--Attorney Eric Sirotkin of Albuquerque announced today that
the Federal First Amendment law suit he filed in September, 2003 on behalf
of teacher Bill Nevins against the Rio Rancho (NM) School District has been
settled. The settlement included a payment of $205,000.00 to Nevins and his
attorney.

The facts established during discovery in this case were that Bill Nevins,
an Albuquerque poet, journalist, teacher, and teachers union (NEA-AFT)
member, had created "a marketplace of ideas" in his Rio Rancho (NM) High
School humanities classes and through the multicultural Write Club and
Poetry Team which he organized and coached at the school administration's
request in 2002-2003. Students, many of whom were "at-risk" challenged
students and from cultural minorities, wrote and performed their original
poems at school and in community poetry readings, with Nevins'
encouragement. The students and Nevins were widely praised. Then, in late
February, 2003, on the eve of the start of the Iraq War, one of Nevins's
team members read over the school's televised public address system an
original poem, "Revolution X", which contained criticism of US government
spending priorities concerning education and war. The high school's Military
Liaison complained to the principal and demanded action, indicating in
writing that whoever authorized the reading of the poem should be
"horsewhipped".

The student's poem was investigated by the RRHS administration and members
of the poetry team were called in and questioned. A campus censorship policy
was put in place that banned the reading of poetry over the address system
and required teachers to screen both students and visiting authors for
"controversial" views. Bill Nevins openly questioned that policy and
encouraged his students to continue to read their poetry publicly. He was
abruptly suspended from coaching and teaching in March, 2003, at a time when
President Bush declared, "You're either with us or against us". Nevins was
banned from the RRHS campus and never permitted to return to teaching there.
In media interviews, Nevins challenged the school administration's actions
towards him, students and the club as an affront to freedom of speech and a
chilling of student creative expression. In May, 2003 Nevins was informed
that his teaching contract would not be renewed. The school allowed one
uncensored poem to be rea d at a flag raising ceremony that said Othose who
stand for peace shut your faces.

Following Nevins's removal, the RRHS Poetry Team disbanded, and to date no
such team has been reinstated, as no faculty member has been willing to step
forward and sponsor it. As one student lamented ³they seem to afraid.

In September 2003, National Lawyers Guild attorney Eric Sirotkin, of
Albuquerque, filed the case in court, claiming violations of Nevins's
Constitutional rights. Nevins's case has received national and international
media attention. A series of benefit poetry and music concerts were held
across the USA in support of Nevins's free speech struggle, including a July
3 Independence Weekend show at New York's Bowery Poetry Club and shows in
Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico and in New England. Support for
Nevins's cause came in from the international writers' organization PEN,
from the National Writers Union (of which Nevins is a member) and from
dozens of prominent writers, in New Mexico and elsewhere, including
folksinger Utah Phillips, Filipina novelist Jessica Hagedorn, songwriter
Jenny Bird, poet Demetria Martinez, Cajun recording star Zachary Richard,
rockers Larry Kirwan, Chris Byrne and Tuli Kupferberg and slam poetry heroes
Saul Williams and Bob Holman. The NYC Irish-ro ck band The Ruffians played a
special concert to back Nevins, and messages of support have come in from
Australia, Europe, Latin America and Africa.

The experience of being a living symbol of defense of American
Constitutional freedoms was made especially poignant for Nevins by the fact
that his son has been a US Army soldier serving in combat in both
Afghanistan and Iraq throughout the period of Nevins' prolonged struggle
here in New Mexico.

Attached are statements from Bill Nevins and His attorney. Nevins states
that he is looking into establishing a foundation to encourage freedom of
speech and that he intends to continue to encourage young poets to write and
speak out freely. A special program for Young Poets arising out of the
settlement will be announced at the Conference. _ _ _

STATEMENTS

July 30, 2004

"The positive resolution of my case with Rio Rancho School District brings a
sense of relief that the Constitutional right to freedom of speech and the
redress of grievances has been reaffirmed.

I hope that this positive resolution will foster in our schools the spirit
of a marketplace of free exchange of ideas and opinions which was present in
my classes and in the Write Club and Poetry Team at Rio Rancho High School.

I hope that students and teachers will be encouraged.

I hope that the youthful voices of poetry, and the voices of the
disadvantaged, the dissident and the dispossessed among us will continue to
sing out without fear of censorship and intimidation, in Rio Rancho,
throughout New Mexico, and everywhere. I pray that those voices may lead us
all towards lasting justice and peace.

I note that even the Rio Rancho High military liaison, in the course of
discovery for this case, stated that he had undergone a change in attitude
in the face of the losses we have suffered in the Iraq War. People can
change, and change can be for the good.

When I think of those of my students, especially those who are people of
color and those who come from less financially-favored homes, I am filled
with joyful memories of their writings and of their outspoken words raised
to be heard in the Write Club and Poetry Team. I am filled with sadness to
think that their voices could have been ignored or silenced by those in
power and by those charged with their educational care.

I do believe that such students inevitably will speak out, will sing out,
again. They shall not be silenced.

As the great African-American poet Langston Hughes wrote in his poem,
"Democracy": "Democracy will not come today, this year, nor ever, through
compromise and fear. Freedom is a strong seed planted in a great need."

May that seed of freedom keep growing here in New Mexico."

-- Bill Nevins _ _ _

This case is a victory for teachers everywhere who, in the current climate
of fear, have grown silent in the face of censorship and calls for blind
patriotism. Our nation¹s greatest achievements have often come from those
who dissented and were willing to question the status quo.

Students are our future. Bill Nevins provided a forum for students to
express themselves and question the world around them. To progress as a
nation, we need more teachers willing to approach the central and often most
controversial issues of our day without fear of retribution.

I hope this case can empower teachers, and send a message to students that
there is justice -- even in the most trying of times.

A military spokesman is silenced after candid comments in a movie on Al Jazeera and Iraq war.

WASHINGTON &#8212; For most of the central figures in the documentary film "Control Room," the grisly images that emerged from last year's U.S. invasion of Iraq were no cause for a change of opinion.

                      Republicans: A Prose Poem

                      Eliot Weinberger



                      "They hate our friends. They hate our values. They =
hate democracy=20

                      and freedom, and individual liberty."

                      President George W. Bush=20



                      "I really do believe that we will be greeted as =
liberators."

                      Vice-President Dick Cheney

                      -------------------------



                      Thomas Donahue, Director of the U.S. Chamber of =
Commerce, is a Republican. He said the newly unemployed should "stop =
whining."=20



                      Alfonso Jackson, Secretary of Housing and Urban =
Development, is a Republican. He explained the enormous cuts to =
low-income housing by saying, "Being poor is a state of mind, not a =
condition."=20



                      Rick Santorum, Senator from Pennsylvania, is a =
Republican. He defended cuts to child care and welfare by suggesting =
that "making people struggle a little bit is not necessarily the worst =
thing."=20



                      Eric Bost, Undersecretary of Food and Nutrition, =
U.S. Department of Agriculture, is a Republican. A study by his own =
agency said that 34 million Americans, including 13.6 million children =
under the age of 12, were affected by hunger, but Bost doubts these =
numbers: "If you ask any teenager if they're happy about the food they =
have in their house, what will they say?" Responding to a report that =
the number of people seeking assistance at food pantries in Ohio had =
increased by 44% in the last three years, Bost told an Ohio newspaper: =
"Food pantries don't require documentation of income. . . so there's no =
proof everyone asking for sustenance at a soup kitchen is truly in =
need."=20



                      Dr. Tom Coburn, former Congressman and current =
candidate for the Senate from Oklahoma, is a Republican. Dr. Coburn =
supports the death penalty for doctors who perform abortions.



                      Republicans do not like dogs. Major General =
Geoffrey Miller, former Chief of Prisons at Guantanamo Bay, now Director =
of Prisons in Iraq, said that "at Guantanamo Bay we learned that the =
prisoners have to earn every single thing that they have. They are like =
dogs and if you allow them to believe at any point that they are more =
than a dog then you've lost control of them."



                      Republicans like dogs. Trent Lott, Senator from =
Mississippi, was asked about the use of attack dogs in torturing an =
Iraqi prisoner. He replied that there's "nothing wrong with holding a =
dog up there unless it ate him."



                      Republicans have a sense of history. The National =
Museum of Naval Aviation now exhibits the actual Navy S-3B Viking =
fighter jet that carried the President to the deck of the USS Abraham =
Lincoln for his "Mission Accomplished" speech. It has "George W. Bush =
Commander-in-Chief" stenciled just below the cockpit window.



                      Republicans are fighting terrorism. Ron Paige, =
Secretary of Education, called the National Education Association, with =
a membership of 2.7 million teachers, a "terrorist organization." Karen =
Hughes, adviser to the President, said that, especially after September =
11, Americans support Bush's efforts to ban abortion because "the =
fundamental issue between us and the terror network we fight is that we =
value every life."=20



                      Patricia "Lynn" Scarlett, Assistant Secretary of =
the Interior, is a Republican. She is the former president of the Reason =
Foundation, a libertarian group, and is opposed to recycling, =
nutritional labeling on food, consumer "right to know" laws, and =
restrictions on the use of pesticides.



                      D. Nick Rerras, State Senator in Virginia, is a =
Republican. He believes that mental illness is caused by demons and, =
somewhat contradictorily, that "God may be punishing families by giving =
children mental illnesses." He also claims that "thunder and lightning =
mean God is mad at you."=20



                      John Yoo, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, is a =
Republican. In January 2002, he sent a 42-page memo to William Haynes =
II, Chief Legal Counsel for the Pentagon, stating that the Geneva =
Conventions, the War Crimes Act, and "customary international law" do =
not apply to the war in Afghanistan. He was seconded by Alberto =
Gonzales, White House Legal Counsel, who wrote: "In my judgment, this =
new paradigm renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning =
of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of its provisions." A few =
days later, the President suspended all rights for prisoners at =
Guantanamo Bay.=20



                      William Haynes II, the recipient of Yoo's memo, is =
a Republican. As the Chief Legal Counsel for the Pentagon, he argued =
that the Defense Department should be exempt from the Migratory Bird =
Treaty Act, and allowed to test bombs on a Pacific Ocean nesting island. =
Such bombing, he said, would please bird-watchers, because it will make =
the birds more scarce, and "bird watchers get more enjoyment spotting a =
rare bird than they do spotting a common one." Haynes has now been =
nominated by the President for a lifetime appointment as a judge on the =
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.



                      Republicans like children. John Cornyn, Senator =
from Texas, speaking in support of the constitutional amendment banning =
gay marriage, said: "It does not affect your daily life very much if =
your neighbor marries a box turtle. But that does not mean it is right. =
Now you must raise your children up in a world where that union of man =
and box turtle is on the same legal footing as man and wife."=20



                      Republicans are optimistic. General Peter =
Schoomaker, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, says that, following September 11, =
"there is a huge silver lining in this cloud." He explains: "War is a =
tremendous focus. . . . Now we have this focusing opportunity, and we =
have the fact that terrorists have actually attacked our homeland, which =
it gives it some oomph."



                      Republicans do not like children. The President =
has never bothered to appoint a director of the Office of Children's =
Health Protection.



                      Craig Manson, Assistant Secretary of the Interior, =
is a Republican. In charge of overseeing the Endangered Species Act, he =
has refused to add any new species to the list. He said: "If we are =
saying that the loss of species in and of itself is inherently bad -- I =
don't think we know enough about how the world works to say that."=20



                      Elaine Chao, Secretary of Labor, is a Republican. =
Her department publishes a pamphlet with tips to employers about how to =
avoid paying overtime wages to workers.=20



                      Jack Kahl and his son John Kahl are Republicans =
and major contributors to the Republican Party. They are, respectively, =
the former and current chairmen and CEOs of Manco, Inc., a company in =
Avon, Ohio. (Motto: "If you're not proud of it, don't ship it.") Manco =
produces 63% of all the duct tape used in the USA. When the Secretary of =
Homeland Security, Tom Ridge, repeatedly urged Americans to buy plastic =
sheeting and duct tape to seal their homes from a biological or chemical =
attack, Manco's sales increased 40% overnight.



                      Republicans have a sense of history. Sonny Perdue, =
the Governor of Georgia, celebrated his election victory, and the end of =
Democratic control, by intoning the words of Martin Luther King: "Free =
at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, we're free at last!" He gave =
his speech in front of a large Confederate flag.=20



                      Sue Myrick, Congresswoman from North Carolina, is =
a Republican. As the keynote speaker at a Heritage Foundation conference =
on "The Role of State and Local Governments in Protecting Our Homeland," =
she said: "Honest to goodness, [my husband] Ed and I, for years, for 20 =
years, have been saying, 'You know, look at who runs all the convenience =
stores across the country.' Every little town you go into, you know?"


                      Republicans are fighting terrorism. In the village =
of Prosser, Washington, a 15-year-old drew some antiwar cartoons in a =
sketchbook for art class; one depicted the President as a devil firing =
rockets. The art teacher turned the sketchbook over to the principal of =
the school, who called the local police chief, who alerted the Secret =
Service, which sent two agents to Prosser to interrogate the boy.



                      John Hostettler, Congressman from Indiana, is a =
Republican. He was briefly detained by security at the Louisville, =
Kentucky, airport, when they found a loaded Glock-9mm automatic pistol =
in his briefcase. In 2000, when the Violence Against Women Act passed =
Congress by a vote of 415 to 3, Hostettler was one of the three.



                      Jeffrey Holmstead, Assistant Administrator for Air =
and Radiation at the Environmental Protection Agency, is a Republican. A =
former lawyer for Montrose Chemical, American Electric Power, and =
various pesticide companies, he served under Bush Sr. on the [Dan] =
Quayle Council on Competitiveness, devoted to weakening existing =
environmental, health, and safety regulations. Holmstead is a member of =
the Citizens for the Environment, an organization that promotes "market =
solutions" to environmental problems, considers acid rain a myth, and =
supports the total deregulation of businesses.



                      Ed Gillespie is Chairman of the Republican =
National Committee. He accuses gays of "intolerance and bigotry" for =
"attempting to force the rest of the population to accept alien moral =
standards."



                      Al Frink is a Republican. He was appointed to the =
newly-created position of Assistant Secretary of Commerce for =
Manufacturing and Services, to address the massive loss of jobs to =
factories overseas. He is the co-owner of Fabrica, a company that makes =
expensive carpets for the White House and the Saudi royal family. =
(Motto: "The Rolls-Royce of Carpets.") Although Fabrica has no factories =
abroad, it has replaced many of its workers with robots because, as =
Frink's partner explained, you don't have to pay health insurance for =
robots.



                      There are American soldiers in Iraq who are =
Republicans. They follow the instructions to tear out a page from the =
pamphlet, "A Christian's Duty" (distributed, with military approval, by =
the In Touch Ministries), and mail it to the White House, pledging that =
they will pray daily for the Administration. The pamphlet includes a =
suggested prayer for each day. "Monday" reads: "Pray that the President =
and his advisers will be strong and courageous to do what is right =
regardless of critics".



                      There are men in Indianapolis, Indiana, who are =
Republicans, but they don't look like ordinary people. At a rally =
promoting Republican economic policy and its effect on the ordinary =
person, those standing behind the President were asked to remove their =
ties and jackets for the cameras.



                      Republicans are fighting terrorism. Tim Pawlenty, =
Governor of Minnesota, wants people arrested at antiwar demonstrations- =
but not at other demonstrations- to pay an additional fine, which will =
be used for "homeland security expenses."



                      Republicans do not like children. A little girl =
asked Richard Riordan, Secretary of Education for the State of =
California, if he knew that her name, Isis, "meant 'Egyptian goddess.'" =
"It means stupid, dirty girl," Riordan replied.



                      Republicans like ice cream, but they do not like =
the ice cream made by Ben & Jerry's, with its notorious support of =
progressive causes. So they have created their own brand, Star-Spangled =
Ice Cream, which has pledged 19% of its profits to conservative =
organizations. Among its flavors are I Hate the French Vanilla, Gun Nut, =
Smaller GovernMINT, Iraqi Road, and Choc & Awe.



                      Jeb Bush, Governor of Florida, is a Republican. He =
opened the nation's first Christian prison, where inmates spend their =
days in prayer and Bible study.



                      Republicans like Hummers. Those who purchase a =
Hummer H-1 for $50,590 receive a tax deduction of $50,590; those who =
purchase a H-2 for $111,845 receive a deduction of $107,107. "In my =
humble opinion," said Rick Schmidt, founder of the International Hummer =
Owners Group, "the H2 is an American icon. . . it's a symbol of what we =
all hold so dearly above all else, the fact we have the freedom of =
choice, the freedom of happiness, the freedom of adventure and =
discovery, and the ultimate freedom of expression. Those who deface a =
Hummer in words or deed deface the American flag and what it stands =
for."



                      Republicans like secrets. Asked by a reporter from =
a newspaper in Apopka, Florida, the White House refused to confirm or =
deny that it had invited members of the Apopka Little League team to =
watch a game of T-ball on the White House Lawn.



                      Republicans have a sense of history. The officials =
of Taney County, Missouri, refused to hang a "plaque of remembrance" =
honoring a Taney County resident who died in the World Trade Center on =
September 11 because he was a Democrat.=20




                      Jerry Regier, Director of the Department of =
Children and Families for the State of Florida, is a Republican. He =
believes that children should be subject to "manly" discipline, that a =
"biblical spanking" leading to "temporary and superficial bruises or =
welts does not constitute child abuse," that women should view working =
outside the home as "bondage," that Christians should not marry =
non-Christians, and that "the radical feminist movement has damaged the =
morale of many women and convinced men to relinquish their biblical =
authority in the home.''=20



                      Republicans have a sense of history. Bill Black, =
Vice Chairman of the California Republican Party, sent his constituents =
an article from the Center for Cultural Conservatism, which read: "Given =
how bad things have gotten in the old USA, it's not hard to believe that =
history might have taken a better turn. ... The real damage to race =
relations in the South came not from slavery, but from Reconstruction, =
which would not have occurred if the South had won."



                      Kathy Cox, Superintendent of Schools for the State =
of Georgia, is a Republican. She wants all textbooks in the state to be =
changed so that the word "evolution" is replaced with "biological =
changes over time."



                      Jim Bunning, Senator from Kentucky, is a =
Republican. He gets a laugh at Republican dinners by joking that his =
opponent in the forthcoming election, Dan Mongiardo, a son of Italian =
immigrants, looks like one of the sons of Saddam Hussein.



                      Republicans have a sense of history. The only =
illustrations in the federal budget, published annually by the =
Government Printing Office, are normally charts and graphs. This year, =
it features 27 color photographs of the President. He is seen in front =
of the Washington monument and in front of a giant American flag, =
reading to a small child, hacking a trail through the wilderness, =
comforting an elderly woman in a wheelchair, and serving an inedible =
food-styled Thanksgiving turkey to the troops in Iraq.



                      Republicans do not like almanacs. On Christmas =
Eve, the FBI sent a bulletin to 18,000 police organizations warning them =
to watch out-- during traffic stops, searches, and other investigations- =
for anyone carrying an almanac. The bulletin stated that "the practice =
of researching potential targets is consistent with known methods of =
al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations that seek to maximize the =
likelihood of operational success through careful planning." Kevin =
Seabrooke, senior editor of the World Almanac, may or may not be a =
Republican. "I don't think anyone would consider us a harmful entity," =
he said.



                      Republicans like the Rush Limbaugh Show and like =
having it broadcast to the troops overseas, five days a week, on the =
official American Forces Radio and Television Service network. When it =
was suggested that they provide more "balanced" political programming, =
Sam Johnson, Congressman from Texas, said that it "sounds a little like =
Communism to me."



                      Stephen Downs, age 61, is probably not a =
Republican. He was shopping at the Crossgates Mall in Guilderland, New =
York, when security guards surrounded him and asked him to leave. Downs =
was wearing a t-shirt with the words "Give Peace a Chance." He refused =
to leave and was arrested for trespassing.



                      My friend, a middle-aged white man, is not a =
Republican. A photographer on assignment for the National Geographic in =
Florida, he was taking pictures of some colorfully painted vans in a =
parking lot. An hour later he was arrested. An alert citizen, suspecting =
possible terrorist information-gathering activity, had called the =
police.



                      Herbert O. Chadbourne is probably a Republican. A =
professor at the evangelical Regent University, he developed a facial =
tic- the result he said, of exposure to biological or chemical agents =
when he was a soldier in the first Gulf War. The university, however, =
said that the tic was a sign that he was possessed by a demon, having =
been cursed by God for sinfulness, and fired him.



                      Jeffrey Kofman, reporter for ABC television, may =
not be a Republican. When he broadcast a story that morale among =
American troops in Iraq was weakening, the White House spread the story =
that not only is Kofman gay, he's a Canadian.



                      Republicans like technology. Although most =
programs for low-income housing and job training have been greatly =
reduced or eliminated, the Department of Labor has created a website for =
the homeless.



                      Republicans like methyl bromide, a pesticide that =
destroys the ozone layer and leads to prostate cancer in farm workers. =
The Reagan administration and 160 nations signed a treaty in 1987 to =
eliminate methyl bromide by 2005. The use of the pesticide has increased =
every year of the current Administration, which is seeking a waiver from =
compliance with the treaty. Claudia A. McMurray, Deputy Assistant =
Secretary of State for Environment, explained: "Our farmers need this."



                      Republicans like dog-race gamblers, NASCAR track =
owners, bow-and-arrow makers, and Oldsmobile dealers. They were among =
those given $170 billion in tax cuts that were slipped into an obscure =
bill intended to resolve a minor trade dispute with Europe.



                      Republicans do not like technology. On September =
11, 2001, the FBI computers were still running on MS-DOS, which could =
only perform single-word searches of their files, and FBI agents did not =
have e-mail. They are hoping a new system will be in place in 2006.



                      Lieutenant General William Boykin, Deputy =
Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, formerly in charge of the =
hunt for Osama bin Laden and currently directing Iraqi prison reform, is =
a Republican. He regularly appears at revival meetings sponsored by a =
group called the Faith Force Multiplier, which advocates applying =
military principles to evangelism. Its manifesto, "Warrior Message," =
summons "warriors in this spiritual war for souls of this nation and the =
world ." Boykin preaches that "Satan wants to destroy this nation, he =
wants to destroy us as a nation, and he wants to destroy us as a =
Christian army," and that Muslims "will only be defeated if we come =
against them in the name of Jesus". He admits that "George Bush was not =
elected by a majority of the voters in the US," but adds: "He was =
appointed by God."



                      Kelli Arena, Justice Department correspondent for =
CNN, is presumably a Republican. She reported that "there is some =
speculation that al Qaeda believes it has a better chance of winning in =
Iraq if John Kerry is in the White House ."=20



                      William "Bucky" Bush, uncle of the President, is a =
Republican. He is a director of Engineer Support Systems, Inc., which =
makes military items, such as the Chemical Biological Protected Shelter =
System (a mobile shed for a WMD attack) or the Field Deployable =
Environmental Control Unit. Since 2001, the company has had sales to the =
Pentagon of $300-400 million a year, and the Department of Homeland =
Security has ordered a fleet of mobile emergency communication centers =
for use in the event of a domestic biochemical attack. He is also a =
director of Lord Abbett & Co., which owns 8 million shares of =
Halliburton. Jeb Bush inserted a line in the Florida state budget =
privatizing elevator inspections. "Bucky" is one of the owners of a =
company called National Elevator Inspection Services.=20



                      Republicans like electronic voting machines. In =
the 1980's, Bob and Todd Urosevich founded a voting machine company, =
eventually called American Information Systems (AIS), with money from =
the Ahmanson family of California. The Ahmansons are Christian =
Reconstructionists who want to establish a theocracy based on biblical =
law and under the "dominion" of Christians. They support the death =
penalty for homosexuals, adulterers, and alcoholics. They are members of =
the secretive Council for National Policy, which combines remnants of =
the John Birch Society with apocalyptic Christians and is considered by =
many to be the driving force of "hard right" ideology. The Ahmansons =
sold the company to the McCarthy Group, whose Chairman and co-owner was =
Chuck Hagel. The McCarthy Group bought another voting machine company, =
Cronus Industries, from the Hunt oil family in Texas, also Christian =
Reconstructionists, who had supplied the original money for the Council =
for National Policy. The two voting machine companies were merged and =
became Election Systems and Software (ES&S), with Hagel as CEO.



                      Republicans like electronic voting machines. ES&S =
counts 80% of the vote in the state of Nebraska. In 1996, Hagel resigned =
from ES&S to run for Senator from Nebraska. His victory was called a =
"stunning upset" by Nebraska newspapers: African-American districts that =
had never voted for a Republican voted for Hagel. In 1992, Hagel ran =
again and received 83% of the vote- 3% more than ES&S-tabulated votes =
and the largest election victory in the history of Nebraska. His =
Democratic opponent asked for a recount, but the Republican-dominated =
state legislature had passed a law that only ES&S could recount the =
votes. Hagel won the recount. No longer Chairman of the McCarthy Group, =
Hagel had been succeeded by Thomas McCarthy, who was his campaign =
treasurer.=20



                      Republicans like electronic voting machines. When =
Jeb Bush first ran for Governor of Florida, his first choice for =
Lieutenant Governor was Sandra Mortham, a lobbyist for ES&S, who was =
receiving commissions for every county that bought ES&S machines.



                      Republicans have a sense of history. John =
LeBoutillier, former Congressman and author of Harvard Hates Americia, =
wants to build the "Counter Clinton Library," a few minutes walk from =
the official Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas. This =
library will be devoted to the "distortions, slanders, spins, and =
outright lies" of the Clinton Administration.



                      The Senate of the State of Texas is controlled by =
Republicans. They passed an "abortion counseling law" which requires =
doctors to warn women that abortion might lead to breast cancer, for =
which there is no medical evidence.



                      The President's Council of Economic Advisers are =
Republicans. In order to show an increase in manufacturing jobs, they =
are considering reclassifying fast-food workers as "manufacturers," =
since they "manufacture" hamburgers.



                      Republicans like formaldehyde. In support of =
changing the regulations on emissions from plywood factories, the White =
House Office of Management and Budget deleted references to studies by =
the National Cancer Institute and replaced them with references to =
studies by the Chemical Industry Institute for Toxicology. The NCI's =
estimate of the risk of leukemia from exposure to formaldehyde was =
10,000 times greater than the estimate by the CIIT.



                      Specialist Sean Baker of the Kentucky National =
Guard, was probably once a Republican, but may no longer be one. =
Assigned to the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, he volunteered to =
portray a detainee in a training drill. A five-man "immediate response =
force" choked and beat him on the steel floor of the 6' x 8' cell, =
despite his shouting the code word and telling his assailants he was an =
American soldier. They finally stopped when his orange prison suit was =
ripped off, revealing a military uniform. Baker spent 48 days in the =
hospital and still suffers from seizures. Laurie Arellano, a Republican =
and spokesperson for the Pentagon, said that Baker's hospital stay was =
"not related to the beating at Guantanamo." A few days later she said =
this was not true. The incident was taped, but the tape has now been =
lost.



                      Bill Nevins may or may not have been a Republican, =
but it is doubtful he is still one. A teacher at the huge Rio Rancho =
High School-- with over 3000 students, the largest in New Mexico- he =
organized a school poetry club, which held a Poetry Slam. At the =
reading, a student read a poem criticizing the President and the war in =
Iraq, in language that was neither violent or obscene. Nevins was =
immediately fired by the Principal, Gary Tripp, for promoting =
"disrespectful speech." He then banned the poetry club and all classes =
in poetry, ordered the student to destroy all of her poetry, and =
threatened to fire her mother- also a teacher at the school- if the girl =
did not. At a school assembly a few days later, Tripp read a poem of his =
own, instructing students who disagreed with him to "shut your faces."



                      Republicans like sex. Jack Ryan, candidate (now =
former candidate) for Senator from Illinois, forced his wife (now =
ex-wife) to visit sadomasochist sex clubs in New York and Paris and =
insisted she have sex with him there while others watched. He defended =
himself by calling these "romantic getaways," and noted,"There was no =
breaking of any laws. There was no breaking of any marriage laws. There =
was no breaking of the Ten Commandments anywhere." Republicans supported =
him, because, as columnist Robert Novack said, "Jack Ryan, unlike Bill =
Clinton, did not commit adultery and did not lie." Ryan's ex-wife is the =
actress Jeri Ryan who, on the television program "Star Trek," portrayed =
a Borg. (Motto: "Resistance is futile.")=20



                      Republicans like meat, and like their meat =
regulated by people from the meat industry. At the US Department of =
Agriculture (USDA), Elizabeth Johnson, Senior Advisor on Food and =
Nutrition, is formerly Associate Director for Food Policy, National =
Cattlemen's Beef Association. James Moseley, Deputy Secretary of =
Agriculture, is formerly Managing Partner, Infinity Pork. Dale Moore, =
Chief of Staff, is formerly Executive Director for Legislative Affairs, =
National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Dr. Eric Hentges, Director, =
Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, is formerly Vice President, =
the National Pork Board. Dr. Charles "Chuck" Lambert, Deputy =
Undersecretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs, is formerly Chief =
Economist, National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Donna Reifschneider, =
Administrator for Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards =
Administration, is formerly President, National Pork Producers Council. =
Mary Kirtley Waters, Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations, is =
formerly Senior Director, ConAgra Foods. Scott Charbo, Chief Information =
Officer, is formerly President, mPower3, a subsidiary of ConAgra Foods. =
The USDA prohibited Creekstone Farms Premium Beef, a company in Kansas, =
from testing all its cattle for mad cow disease, for it would cause =
undue alarm among consumers and pressure the other beef producers to =
similarly test their stock.



                      Republicans like Freedom fries (formerly known as =
French fries). At the request of the frozen Freedom fry (formerly known =
as French fry) industry, the USDA changed the classification of frozen =
Freedom fries (formerly known as French fries) to "fresh vegetable," so =
that the food could be listed in the Department's promotion of a healthy =
diet.=20



                      Republicans do not like sex. Robert F. McDonnell, =
Chairman of the House Courts of Justice Committee for the State of =
Virginia, said that "engaging in anal or oral sex might disqualify a =
person from being a judge." Republicans like sex. A few days later, =
McDonnell's campaign manager, Robin Vanderwell, was arrested for =
soliciting a young boy over the internet.



                      Ralph Reed is a Republican. When he was the =
director of the Christian Coalition, he campaigned against gambling, =
calling it a "cancer on the American body politic" that is "stealing =
food from the mouths of children." He is now the lobbyist for a large =
casino.



                      Anna Perez, former Counselor for Communications to =
Condoleezza Rice and former Press Secretary for Barbara Bush, is a =
Republican. NBC appointed her Executive Vice President for =
Communications. "I love the television business," she said, although "I =
have no expertise in it."



                      Paul O'Neill is a Republican. When he was =
Secretary of the Treasury, he recommended that corporations pay no taxes =
at all. As it is, only 60% of corporations currently pay federal taxes.=20



                      Michael Skupkin, founder of a religious software =
company and leader of the Presidential Prayer Team, is a Republican. He =
was urged to run for Senator from Michigan, but eventually refused. =
Skupkin had become famous on the televison program, "Survivor 2," for =
catching and slaughtering a wild boar with his bare hands, and then =
painting his face with its blood. The Presidential Prayer Team is an =
independent organization with millions of participants, who are given =
daily instructions, such as: "Pray for the president as he meets with =
Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Ton on May 6. The two leaders will =
discuss strengthening our bilateral relations as well as the =
U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement."=20



                      Mark Rey, former Vice President of the American =
Forest and Paper Association, former Vice President of the National =
Forest Products Association, former Executive Director of the American =
Forest Resource Alliance, a coalition of 350 timber corporations, is a =
Republican. As the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and the =
Environment, he now oversees the U.S. Forest Service, and is responsible =
for the management of 155 national forests, 19 national grasslands, and =
15 land utilization projects on 192,000,000 acres of publicly-owned =
lands in 44 states. He is the author of the "Salvage Rider," which =
suspended all environmental laws in the national forests, and which was =
called by the New York Times "the worst piece of conservation =
legislation ever written."=20



                      Republicans like electronic voting machines. 8 =
million people- 8% of the voters- vote on machines made by Diebold Inc., =
whose CEO is Wally O'Dell. In 2000 O'Dell was Chairman of the Ohio Bush =
for President Committee. In 2004 he has said that he is "committed to =
helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the President." Bob =
Urosevich, co-founder of AIS, is now Director of Diebold Election =
Systems. (His brother remains at ES&S.)



                      Republicans support education. This year the =
President has proposed new education initiatives: $40 million to help =
math and science professionals become teachers, $52 million to create =
more Advanced Placement courses in high school, $100 million for reading =
for middle and high schoolers who still have trouble reading, and $270 =
million for sexual abstinence classes.



                      Republicans support legislation with cheerful =
names: Healthy Forests, Clean Skies, Climate Leaders, No Child Left =
Behind, KidCare. Healthy Forests opens up Sequoia National Park and =
other parks and national wilderness areas to logging and more roads for =
loggers. Clean Skies allows 68% more nitrogen oxide, 125% more sulfur =
dioxide, and 420% more mercury air pollution than the Clean Air law it =
replaces. Climate Leaders is a plan for businesses to voluntarily reduce =
their greenhouse gas emissions; of the many thousands of potential =
Leaders, only 14 have volunteered. No Child Left Behind cuts most school =
programs in favor of standardized testing. KidCare, a Jeb Bush =
initiative in the state of Florida, resulted in 167,500 children losing =
their medical insurance.



                      Jerry Thacker, marketing consultant and member of =
the Presidential Advisory Commission on AIDS and HIV, is a Republican. =
He has called AIDS the "gay plague," describes homosexuality as a =
"deathstyle," and states that only "Christ can rescue the homosexual."



                      The Rev. Scott Breedlove, pastor of the Jesus =
Church of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is probably a Republican. His plans for a =
large outdoor book-burning were thwarted by officials of the Cedar =
Rapids Fire Department. A city fire inspector suggested shredding the =
books, but Breedlove said that didn't seem very biblical.



                      Pat Tillman was probably a Republican. After =
September 11, he gave up a multimillion dollar contract as a =
professional football player to join the Army Rangers in Afghanistan, =
where he died in combat. As the only soldier with some previous national =
recognition, he was on the verge of media canonization when it was =
revealed that he had been killed by American troops in a "friendly fire" =
incident.



                      Zell Miller, Senator from Georgia, might as well =
be a Republican. He is a Democrat who campaigns for the President and =
speaks at Republican events. The torture at Abu Ghraib prison reminded =
him of his high school gym: "The two times I think I have been most =
humiliated in my life was standing in a big room, naked as a jaybird =
with about fifty others and they were checking us out, now that was =
humiliating. It was humiliating showering with sixty others in a public =
shower. It didn't kill us did it? No one ever died from humiliation."



                      Republicans are fighting terrorism. Police and =
intelligence authorities are now examining immigration files and lists =
of voter registration, driver's licences, university enrollment, library =
withdrawals, airplane reservations, credit card purchases, birth =
certificates, and Social Security numbers in the attempt to uncover =
terrorist links. They have, however, been expressly forbidden by =
Attorney General Ashcroft from looking at the lists of background checks =
for gun purchasers.



                      Republicans are fighting terrorism, but it is =
sometimes difficult to tell who is a terrorist and who is a Republican. =
Attorney General John Ashcroft has warned that al-Qaeda operatives in =
the United States are very likely to be "European-looking," in their =
late twenties or early thirties, traveling with their families, and =
speaking English.



                      Republican like large bombs. Having already =
developed the Massive Ordnamce Air Blast (MOAB), a 21,000-pound bomb, =
they are now working on MOP, the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, which =
weighs 30,000 pounds.



                      Rick Perry, Governor of Texas, is a Republican. He =
does not believe that the wealthy should pay for the education of the =
poor, so he has proposed reducing property taxes and replacing them with =
larger taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, and a $5 tax every time a patron =
enters a topless bar.=20


                      John Graham, former CEO of Strat@comm, a public =
relations and lobbying firm for the automobile industry, and founder of =
the Sports Utility Vehicle Owners of America, is a Republican. As the =
Administrator in Charge of Regulations for the National Highway Traffic =
Safety Administration, he has introduced greatly inferior standards for =
automobile tires.=20



                      Judge John Leon Holmes, appointed by the President =
to a lifetime seat on the Federal District Court, is a Republican. He =
supports a constitutional amendment banning abortion, has compared =
pro-choice advocates to Nazis and abortion to slavery, and has written =
that "concern for rape victims is a red herring because conceptions from =
rape occur with approximately the same frequency as snowfall in Miami." =
Confronted with statistics showing that some 30,000 American women =
become pregnant each year from rape or incest, Jeff Sessions, Senator =
from Alabama and a Republican, defended Holmes by saying that he was =
merely using "a literary device called exaggeration for effect."



                      Josh Llano, Southern Baptist Army chaplain in =
Iraq, is a Republican. At the Army V Corps camp in the desert near =
Najaf, where water is in short supply and washing rare, he was given a =
500-gallon pool to use for baptisms. Soldiers are agreeing to sit =
through the three-hour ceremony in order to get a bath.



                      Republicans are fighting terrorism. Rick Santorum, =
Senator from Pennsylvania, in support of the constitutional amendment =
banning gay marriage, said: "I would argue that the future of our =
country hangs in the balance because the future of marriage hangs in the =
balance. Isn't that the ultimate homeland security, standing up and =
defending marriage?"=20



                      Republicans are fighting terrorism. In October =
2001, Ansar Mahmood, a pizza delivery man and legal immigrant in Hudson, =
New York, went to the banks of the Hudson River to take some photographs =
of the beautiful scenery to send to his village in Pakistan. What he did =
not know was that he was standing near a water treatment plant and that =
there was a general hysteria about terrorists poisoning the water =
supply. Mahmood is still in jail.



                      Haley Barbour, Governor of Mississippi, is a =
Republican. His campaign was vigorously supported by the President and =
the Council of Conservative Citizens, which supports deporting =
African-Americans to Africa, denies the Holocaust took place, and =
opposes the immigration of all non-white people as well as the "mixing =
of the races."



                      Allan Fitzsimmons, Fuels Coordinator at the =
Department of Interior and in charge of implementing the Healthy Forests =
initiative, is a Republican. Although he has no background in forest =
management, he has written articles questioning the existence of =
ecosystems, calling them a "mental construct." He has accused religious =
organizations that promote protecting the environment of succumbing to =
idolatry.=20



                      Republicans do not like children. The Food and =
Drug Administration has eliminated laws requiring separate testing for =
drugs that are prescribed for children as well as adults.



                      Republicans like to help impoverished nations. The =
Administration has proposed that these countries generate income by =
allowing hunters to kill elephants and other "trophy" animals, and =
wildlife traders and the pet industry to capture rare birds. It has also =
proposed that the importation of ivory tusks, skins, and antlers be made =
legal again.



                      Republicans like electronic voting machines. It =
was a surprise when Max Cleland, a popular Democratic Senator from =
Georgia, lost his bid for re-election. Some attributed the defeat to =
Republican television advertisements juxtaposing Cleland with Osama bin =
Laden, questioning the Senator's patriotism even though Cleland had lost =
both legs and an arm in the Vietnam War. This was the first election in =
which all votes in Georgia were cast on electronic voting machines. The =
machines were manufactured by Diebold.



                      Republicans do not like international treaties.



                      Randall Tobias, global coordinator for AIDS, is a =
Republican. After two years, only 2% of the $18 billion allotted to =
fight AIDS has been spent. One-third of it, by law, must be used for =
"abstinence education." Much of the rest will be spent on drugs. Tobias =
decides whether the Administration will purchase generic drugs or =
name-brand drugs, which are three to five times as expensive. Tobias is =
the former CEO of the pharmaceutical corporation Eli Lilly, which has =
donated at least $1.5 million to Republicans since 2000.



                      William G. Myers, recently appointed to a lifetime =
seat on the Court of Appeals, is a Republican. Evidently a classical =
scholar, he referred to the California Desert Protection Act, which =
created Joshua Tree National Park, Death Valley National Park, and the =
Mojave National Preserve, as "an example of legislative hubris."



                      Republicans like electronic voting machines. The =
State of Maryland is worried about possible fraud in its machines, so it =
has hired the Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) to =
oversee elections. The former CEO of SAIC and current Chairman of its =
VoteHere division, is Admiral Bill Owens, former military aide to Dick =
Cheney.



                      Republicans do not like the cactus pygmy owl, =
although there are only thirty left, Puget Sound orcas, Florida =
manatees, Florida panthers, or the Kemp's ridley turtle.



                      Cindy Jacobs is a Republican. She is the founder =
of the Generals of Intercession, an organization devoted to "winning =
nations for Christ" through a "military-style prayer strategy." In 2002, =
God told her that the U.S. would invade Iraq, and she convened an =
"international gathering of Generals" in Washington, D.C.. "Each of us =
felt in our hearts that God wants to humble the spirit of Islam and its =
god, Allah, and that God is leading President Bush." At the meeting, =
according to Jacobs, one of the Generals said "she had been studying =
Jeremiah 50:2, which says, 'Declare among the nations, Proclaim, and set =
up a standard; Proclaim--do not conceal it--Say, Babylon is taken, Bel =
is shamed.' Some Bible translations say 'confounded' rather than =
'shamed.' As she looked up the word 'confounded' in her lexicon, she =
found that the word in Hebrew is 'Bush'! We were amazed at that!"



                      Mickey Mouse is a Republican. 7.3 million shares =
of Disney are owned by the Florida state pension fund, which is =
controlled by Jeb Bush. Disney has an agreement with the state granting =
them complete control, "free from government oversight," of over 40,000 =
acres. In the days following September 11, the President urged the =
country to "Go down to Disney World in Florida. Take your families and =

the Michael Moore film "Fahrenheit 9/11."



                      Republicans are fighting terrorism, but the one =
genuine terrorist captured, accidentally, on American soil, has never =
been mentioned in the 2,295 press releases issued by John Ashcroft and =
the Office of the Attorney General. William Krar of Noonday, Texas, =
mailed a package containing false U.N. credentials, Defense Intelligence =
Agency identification cards, phony birth certificates, and forged =
federal concealed weapons permits to a fellow terrorist. The Post Office =
delivered it to the wrong address, and the recipient notified the FBI. =
At Krar's home they found fully automatic machine guns, =
remote-controlled explosive devices disguised as briefcases, 60 pipe =
bombs, 500,000 rounds of ammunition, and enough pure sodium cyanide, as =
the FBI said, "to kill everyone inside a 30,000 square foot building. =
Krar, however, is a White Supremacist, and not a Muslim.=20



                      Republicans do not like elections. After the =
Presidential election of 2000, Congress approved $4 billion to help =
states improve their voting systems for the 2004 election. Very little =
of the money has been distributed. Congress also created the Election =
Assistance Commission to oversee these improvements. For years, the =
White House delayed appointing any members or providing any of the funds =
appropriated. In 2004, it named DeForest "Buster" Soaries Jr., a New =
Jersey minister, as Director of the Commission. His first act was to ask =
for emergency legislation from Congress giving the Commission the =
authority to cancel the elections in the event of a terrorist attack.=20



                      God is a Republican. Speaking to a group of Amish =
farmers, the President told them: "God speaks through me."



                      Republicans have a sense of history. Mitch =
McConnell, Senator from Kentucky, wants to replace Alexander Hamilton on =
the $10 bill with Ronald Reagan. Dana Rohrabacher, Congressman from =
California, wants to replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill with Ronald =
Reagan. Jeff Miller, Congressman from Florida, wants to replace John =
Kennedy on the 50-cent piece with Ronald Reagan. Mark Souder, =
Congressman from Indiana, wants to replace Franklin Roosevelt on the =
dime with Ronald Reagan. Bill Frist, Senate Majority Leader, wants to =
rename the Pentagon as the Ronald Reagan National Defense Building. =
Grover Norquist of the Leave Us Alone Coalition (whose weekly meetings =
are attended by representatives of the President and Vice President) and =
Director of the Ronald Reagan Legacy Project, wants to put a monument to =
Ronald Reagan in every one of the 3000 counties in the United States. =
Matt Salmon, Congressman from Arizona, wants Ronald Reagan's head carved =
on Mount Rushmore.




                      George W. Bush, President of the United States, is =
a Republican. To demonstrate personal sacrifice and his determination to =
win the War on Terror, he gave up desserts and candy a few days before =
he announced the invasion of Iraq.

>
>2) The second piece was written by La Calaca Review editor Manuel J. Velez

>
>Se trata de que el prolific Gordo has just dropped in from the wilds of
>Oregon with a new (again?) publication Bajo el Sol de Aztlan, hot off the
>press, ready for distribution, and fiercely clung to by massive arms. Y
>como se esto no fuera suficiente, he unloads the manuscript of 43 Costales
>. . . mas, for me to deal with! ¡Orale, pues!  Le hago el try.
>
>So here i am, now, not merely producing poemas in frustrating creativity,
>pero tambien writing introductions to Raza (inspiring) poets' books. Poets
>who have tread poetic grounds longer than i have tried hooking up my
>versos, los unos con los otros. ¿Y porque no?  If WE are to define
>(acknowledge) Chicano Literature as the unique reality (vida) that it is,
>entonces vale mas salirle al toro.
>
>The writings of Abelardo came to me behind 40 foot walls.  Occasional
>copies of Chicano Press publications accidently received in (or smuggled
>into) the U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, laid heavy classics on
>us.Â Pintos reading "Stupid America," that mini-manifesto of profound
>indictment, came to grips with their personal situations for the first
>time; the realization of being colonized & criminalized by an insensitive
>and corrupt system of government. Many of our beautiful young poetas (yes,
>ameriKKKa, we're coming at you from every rincon/rendija of Aztlan!) cut
>their eyeteeth on "25 Pieces of a Chicano Mind" and "The Chicano Movement:
>Some Not Too Objective Observations."
>
>Then came "el encuentro" en Idaho. Ricardo lo dijo primero . . . /but i too
>saw/ un gigantesco grizzly/ Bear bronceado/ come charging down/ las
>avenidas del amor/ He came/ tumbando obstÃ¡culos/ esos obstacles que hacen/
>keep our rios (de aqua fresca) from flowing/ nuestras florestas brillantes
>from blooming/ our canciones (gritos del alma) unsung. /LALO, acompañado
>con/ su osito (future poet-crÃ³nico de Aztlan). /iva derrumbando mitos/
>long existent/ Mitos que hasta las mejores mentes (gentes)/ have so
>scholarly embraced/ Myths that lend a further credence/ to magnanimous/
>Social Lie;/ that mentira fostered & festered by decadent/ politico
>regimes.
>
>Abelardo "Lalo" Delgado is an enigmatic figure en el movimiento. La area de
>activism en cual el Gordo hace operate es la de migrant health y migrant
>education; su dedicacion is nonetheless, bien firme. Considered a moderate
>by some, others find his ideas (visiones) to be of a radical nature. One
>obtrusive "observer" has called him a religious mystic, his more intimate
>compas say que es "muy carbon."
>
>En su vida personal tambien, Lalo ever appears as the jolly ho-ho-ho-ing
>poeta. Pero en realidad, lleva sus viejas cicatrices y heridas frescas,
>ondamente . . . que siempre duelan. He has painstakingly been a father . .
>. many times in absentia. He has also been a husband . . . remains a
>husband . . . with the same ambivalent intensity of joy and hurt. He is
>seldom mistaken for an intellectual, but the cachitos of wisdom he offers
>us througn his poemas, are of a substance that would make an "intellectual"
>cringe with shame. He has become more cynical and satirical in later years
>(who can escape it in this society?), yet he continues to have faith; faith
>en la gente. He is seriously committed to effecting social change. His

>I met Lalo last October at EPCC.Â  I had arranged for him to come to El
>Paso and do some readings at EPCC, Bowie High and The Clinica La Fe's
>Cultural Center.  All three events were wonderful and Lalo was so full of
>energy.  The vato came out of Bowie High mas cansado after an hour of
>poetry at the top of his lungs and still gave an amazing performance in
>Segundo the next night.  That's why the news of Lalo's passing continues to
>leave me stunned even twenty-four hours after I heard the news.
>
>I guess because I invited him, I had the honor (and I mean that sincerely)
>to drive him around town between various events and his relatives' homes.
>Some memories of those days still remain vivid in my mind, and I know now
>they'll never fade:
>
>I can still hear the conversations in my car on Friday, on our way to Bowie
>High School.  Lalo is sitting shotgun in my little nissan sentra and behind
>us are Henry Irigoyen and Mario Chavarria, two of Segundo's veterano
>activists who, through the whole trip,  call over to Lalo and remind him of
>some desmadre that happened years ago in the barrio.  "Ay.  Te acuerdas
>cuando nos robamos el kegger from your daughter's wedding?" and they would
>laugh for a few seconds before moving on to another story.
>
>I still remember the morning I met Lalo.  I had arranged for him to come
>and speak to one of my English classes at EPCC.  The class began at nine
>and Henry Irigoyen was supposed to bring him over to the room.  But as the
>clock moved closer to 9:00, no one had heard anything from Lalo.  When 9:00
>o'clock finally came around, I figured Lalo had decided to spend time with
>his family instead.  Shrugging my shoulders, I grabbed my bag and walked
>out of my office, piediendole disculpas from an older vato who happened to
>be standing in the hallway by my office door.  I walked into the classroom,
>explained to the students that Lalo wasn't going to make it, and realized I
>had left my book in my office.  I told my students I would be right back
>and I ran  to get my book.  In the hallway, the same vato stood, kinda
>looking this way and that until he finally fixed his look upon me.  I
>slowed down.  It still hadn't hit me at that point (that early in the
>morning my senses haven't completely hit 100%) when I asked him if he
>needed some help.  He kinda looked at me and asked, "Manuel Velez?"  Right
>then I realized that this man, holding a folder and some books in his hand,
>looking as lost as a freshman on the first day of high school, was Lalo.
>He had decided to eliminate the middle man and called EPCC to get my office
>number hoping to meet me before class.  But for reasons that I just can't
>explain, the vato made it to my office but never knocked on the door,
>choosing instead to wait for me to come out.  When I finally did, again for
>reasons I could never explain, he just let me walk past him without saying
>a word.
>
>Later on I asked him about it and he told me my office door was locked and
>he didn't want to disturb me. Me.  Disturbed by Lalo Delgado.  His poem
>"It's Bicentenial Time, Carnales" hung on the walls of the MEChA office at
>UTEP while I was a student there.  I read it everyday for three years.  I
>wanted to write like that.  Me.  Disturbed by Lalo Delgado.  Todavia no me
>entra.
>
>While I was driving around with Lalo through El Paso's light brown streets,
>I would notice that he would take a yellow legal pad from his bag and write
>some lines down.  Later on he shared with me what he had been writing.
>They were two poems; one about/for EPCC and one about/for Bowie High
>School.  He read them out loud to me in the front of his hotel then tore
>out the pages from the pad, handing them over to me. I have, I swear,
>intended to take the Bowie High one over to the campus, but instead it sits
>in my file drawer, safely tucked into some folders (I want to think that
>I've been just been waiting for a good moment to take it down, maybe type
>it up nice for them; but I think the closer truth is that I just don't want
>to give it away). The truth is, I just remembered that I had them.  I live
>about three blocks away from Fort Bliss and every night, it seems, at about
>11:00 the slow notes of "Taps" floats onto the air and falls on my yard
>like fog.  I'm sure it's in honor of the soldiers dying in Iraq, but
>tonight while I smoked my cigarette and heard the trumpet begin its first
>note, I could only think of Lalo.  That's when the poems came into my
>memory.  I pulled them out, read them several times, and decided I wanted
>to share them with you.  I'll probably send the Bowie poem over to Bowie
>this week.  I haven't decided yet but in the meantime I offer them in his
>memory.  So all of you can get a glimpse of the Lalo I got to know on a few

>Lalo Delgado: beloved icon, poet
>
>By Tina Griego
>Rocky Mountain News - July 24, 2004
>
>An icon in this city died Friday.
>
>His name was Abelardo Barrientos Delgado. Everyone knew him as Lalo. He was
>a poet, a teacher, a gentleman. He was one of the rare few in this town who
>earned the right to be called a community leader. He dedicated his life to
>it, to us, Latinos, Chicanos, Mexicanos.
>
>"Our poet laureate and peaceful warrior is dying," was what Estevan Flores
>said in the e-mail he sent out Friday morning.
>
>Estevan broke down crying when I called him three hours later to say that
>Lalo had died. From all parts of the country, condolences are arriving.
>Lalo Delgado was one of the nation's most renowned Chicano poets, a man
>whose biography needs an extra page just for his awards, whose words and
>ways inspired hundreds of people.
>
>At the home of one of his eight children, the telephone won't stop ringing.
>Hugs are given and coffee is brewed and outside so many cars crowd the
>street a neighbor calls the police while thunder rumbles and the rain
>pounds. "That's dad," his daughter, Amelia Cruz, says, "out with a bang."
>
>A few years ago, a friend of mine gave me Lalo's name on a slip of paper
>and told me that he would teach me Spanish if I wanted a good teacher. I
>did not know then but realized later that Lalo may have been a good Spanish
>teacher - I never found out - but the language he taught was the language
>of vision, of hope, of expectation and desire.
>
>He wrote of social justice, death, of fathers unrecognized, women denied,
>hearts betrayed. He wrote on napkins and toilet paper and the margins of
>newspapers. He wrote in English and Spanish. He gathered pages of his work
>and slid them between plastic sheets, snapping them into binders along with
>lottery tickets he played and stamps from letters he received and job
>applications he filled out. Then he gave them to each of his 19
>grandchildren, every book as unique as each of them. "34 Guadalupes of
>Abelardo" he wrote to his grandson, Raymond, "so that when you grow up, you
>will get to know me . . . even if I am not around."
>
>As he was dying, he started a fresh notebook he called "Delgado's Command
>Post," and he recorded the date of his biopsy and the egg he had for
>breakfast and upon those pages he christened the tumor consuming his liver,
>"the monster."
>
>"The battle begins," he wrote and when his hand was still strong, he
>declared: "Don't buy me flowers just yet."
>
>"The president says prosperity is just around the corner," reads one of his
>hundreds of poems, "but most likely it's around that dry river where the
>INS is baptizing undocumented workers. In the name of the father and the
>son and the falling Wall Street."
>
>"The I is dead," he wrote in another, lamenting conformity and
>commercialization. "Advertisers watch the funeral and grin, theirs is
>nothing short of mortal sin. They are the ones who dared evacuate the minds
>of men. To place them in a M&M."
>
>He skewered racism in his most famous poem, "stupid america," written in
>1969 during the rage and fervor of the Chicano movement. Should you have
>forgotten, Denver Public Schools were still deliberately segregated then.
>
>"You don't have time to rest," he once said. "You have to keep sharp and
>keep fighting."
>
>Lalo Delgado was a "man of both borders," says Ramon del Castillo, his
>friend and fellow poet. Born in Chihuahua, Mexico, Lalo moved to the United
>States when he was 12 years old. Not long thereafter, he began writing. He
>was a "dreamer of great dreams" a Catholic newspaper article said, in a
>story describing the 22-day hunger strike he went on to prod the Catholic
>archdiocese into providing more low-income housing.
>
>He taught in Seattle, in Utah, in Texas, and for the last 17 years he
>taught Chicano studies at Metropolitan State College. He was a former
>director of the Colorado Migrant Council and a worker at the Justice
>Information Center.
>
>Does all of this convey the man Lalo Delgado was? I am afraid I do not do
>him justice. I don't possess his vision, but am moved by his spirit when I
>say that he was a man who emanated and radiated and illuminated. He had an
>easy laugh and a fierce stubbornness and the love and strength of his wife,
>Lola, who stood by his side for more than 50 years and was not any more
>ready to let him leave than he was to say goodbye.
>
>"Please," he told the doctor earlier this week, "if you can just give me a
>little longer."
>
>And the doctor, with tears in his eyes, said there was nothing he could do.
>
>In 1974, while he was teaching literature in Utah, the University of
>Northern Colorado invited him to come and read. Del Castillo, then a
>student, was assigned to meet him at the airport.
>
>"At the time, you know, you could wait at the gate and I remember this guy
>with a serape came out and I looked at him and he looked at me and he
>shouted, 'Ah-hooaa," and I went "Ah-hooii," and he gave me this big bear
>hug, and I didn't even know him. He was a lively spirit.
>
>"I remember being awakened at 5:30 in the morning by someone singing in the
>shower and it was Lalo . . . . One time I got invited to read for the
>Hispanic Republicans and I said, 'Lalo, what do I do?' He said, 'Go, Ramon,
>and make sure they never invite you back.' "
>
>Final words. There are none for Lalo Delgado. There are only words, his,
>and we are lucky to have them.
>
>stupid america, see that chicano
>
>with a big knife
>
>in his steady hand
>
>he doesn't want to knife you
>
>he wants to sit on a bench

>stupid america, hear that chicano
>
>shouting curses on the street
>
>he is a poet

Besides various OULIPO projects, there's also "Making Shapely
Fiction," by Jerome Stern which has fifteen "shapes" or plot
structures, as well as a short guide of what not to do and a
list of fiction related definitions.  It's a good how-to book.

Dear all,

In spite of its nomadic editor, Factorial is still alive...but has
shifted its distribution to Amazon.com. (Too much work, flying to San
Diego to check for orders, cash checks, mail out books...) SPD
rejected Factorial, so Amazon it is. The first two issues are now
available there (listed as One Factorial & Two Factorial), the third
issue is being typeset right now - a Japanese/English/French
trilingual issue! With a Gozo Yoshimasu manuscript page on the cover!
Stay tuned for more!

By the way...the first issue is worth getting for the front and back
covers alone, but it also features excerpts from Body Image, a
Waldrop/Howe collaborative Burning Deck book that is also selling on
Amazon for $247.

Was Whitaker Chambers still talking to Zukofsky on any level after World War
II. Has anybody characterized the relationship

Was Chambers Jewish? How much of the Fugitive etc. attack on Modernism also
operates as the High Church's tradition fed repellence of anything involving
a Jewish mix, as well as, I suspect the unwashed Irish thrown in, as well.

Kevin, I think - as I have often suggested - you are quite accurate about
the omission of the impact of the visual arts on the shaping of Poetry,
and/or criticism. In terms of the West Coast, it's quite easy to see the
impact of painters like Graves & Mark Toby, and Lloyd Reynolds (Reed College
Calligrapher) on bringing in (India) Indian, Japanese and Chinese thought &
meditation practices, as well as any number of 30's & 40's attention to the
pure object (Weston, Lange, A Adams, etc.) In terms of Gay
influence/presence - Minor White - has a strong reciprocal relationship with
the work of  James Broughton. I suspect Graves' influence is not  one of
sexual orientation(or any politics)  - at least as any subtext within the
images of birds, etc. - but a quality of attention at home with his
religious practice. (Vedanta?) Lange and several other WPA artists can be
connected to the politics. In the East, I suspect, one would certainly have
to include Ben Shawn, particularly the photographs as as person with great
influence and presence among writers.

It is interesting to juxtapose the era's west coast 'giants' of Rexroth and
Roethke - the former out of "the box" and the latter in. The box being the
formalism of the East, and the gods that protected that box. (Ironically, I
like them both).  R Duncan always seems a little torn between keeping up
with the Euro modernist footprint (often shaking it as hard as he can) or
turning East and sharing the lead with Lou Harrison - and the other
composers, many of whom were gay and shaped by the toned based progressions
of the far Pacific.

 But, back to your 'art blind poetry critic' point, I do think many
undergrad and grad programs in writing would benefit greatly from the
history of the infusion of music, painting, photography. Etc.  Especially,
as more than ever we move into an 'adobe photo-shop' multimedia world of
text, sound, & image- I think such knowledge will would often enhance
critical work, in terms of fully looking back at earlier writing and, at
least, provide a larger or different kind of horizon for new writing -even
if one remains making objects  in text only.  Locally at the SF Art
Institute - at least by example of visual and critical interest - has a
teaching lead here.

The only points where I see this happening is the much discussed nexus of
New York School writers, artists and artworks. Tho I suspect those
relationships are (again) up for critical grabs.  As you suggest, locally, a
little Jess and Duncan can go along way, where I don't know if anyone has
explored the relation of the operations in Jess' collages with certain
strategies of Spicer??

Anyway, Kevin, it's been a provocative delight to you read these "O"
accounts. (Maybe there are more?) Did I already call you, "Gide by the Bay."
I think it's true. Keep that eye, ear and body travelng. It's great to
appreciate your knowledge and whatever humor and twist comes down the pipe

Hello,

This is just a friendly reminder.

The Projects Reading Series is hosting the third of an ongoing reading =
series located at 1506 Projects, a small, intimate art gallery on =
Capitol Hill.  Readings are scheduled at the writers=92 convenience.  =
Diana George is one of my favorite writers in Seattle.  Her material =
always surprises me.  Her work borders the fantastic and the scientific, =
written in hard, careful prose.  Her stories conflate fiction, theory, =
research, and text.  Her theme is death in its most material =
manifestations (I=92m reminded of a lecture she gave a long time ago =
reflecting on the parallel developments of embalming and photography in =
the late 1800s).  The theme is dark, and her writing reflects this with =
thick, distended sentences.  Her writing is also dedicated and humorous =
and generous in its concentration.  She has been away for the past two =
years so I=92m very happy to have her read again in Seattle.

=20

I am in debt to Stacey Levine for introducing me to David Ohle, whom =
I=92m very proud to be hosting.  Ohle is the author of Motorman, =
originally published in 1972.  It will be reprinted by 3rd bed, and its =
sequel will be published by Softskull Press.  Motorman is a satire about =
Moldenke, a good-natured anti-hero who never seems to know who is =
pulling the strings, where they are being pulled from, or how or why.  =
The circumstances are shadowy.  The insinuations, oblique.  As the =
writing sample below points to, the writing is =93lateral.=94  It =
interacts with the reader=92s thoughts via tenuous associations.  The =
comparisons between Moldenke=92s world and ours, although of course =
similar, are also quite removed so that this world of Moldenke=92s =
ensnares the reader in its own despairing logic, which is inevitably =
sideways.

=20

Thanks to Dianna Molzan, Neal Bashor, and Sarah Bergman at 1506 Projects =
for allowing me to use their space to present Diana George and David =
Ohle.  I hope you all will be able to join us.

DIANA GEORGE

Diana George lives in Seattle. Her fiction has appeared in 3rd bed, and =

III.  The Work

from Selvedge

Where the Suicidists lived and what they saw =96 these are as important =
as my work with the tapes and the notes.  The somber progress of the =
distant container ships, the way they suffer the tugboats=92 hectoring =
proximity, the immense river-mouth that appears to climb straight up the =
horizon rather than to spread out flat, all these combine to induce a =
yearning that might easily collapse into despondency.  A certain =
hopelessness, too, is inherent in the depth of the channel and the =
superceded shallows of the port:  the town was built for ships long ago =
but cannot harbor them now.  The formation of the Suicidists=92 =
particular sensibilities was probably coeval with the emergent history =
of container-shipping on that river; no one has investigated this yet.  =
In my contributions to the Total Annual, such connections will be, must =
be, examined.

After the mock War was apparently over, the army let Moldenke go.  He =
found work as a bloodboy in a gauze mill outside Texaco City, a klick or =
two from the LA limits.  He started low and remained there, sure that =
safety embraced felicity on a mattress of obscurity.  He knew that =
vertical activity invited dazzling exposure, and that to seek is to be =
sucked.  He recognized loneliness as the mother of virtues and sat in =
her lap whenever he could.  He practiced linear existence and sidewise =
movement, preferring the turtle to the crane, the saucer to the lamp.  =
He enjoyed the downstairs and chafed at going up.  All of this, despite =
what his mother had told him:  =93Sonny,=94 she had said, a circle of =
rouge on each of her cheeks, her eyes like basement windows.  =93Son,=94 =
she said, =93I want you to always have a job to go to, no matter what it =
is or where it is or what it involves.  What matters is whether or not =
it lets you go up.=94

Kevin--

Thanks for the reports. I think a poetic death list is a fantastic idea.
Besides Jess Collins croaking this year here is the poet death toll.
Please, others, keep adding to it. I apologize in advance, if you knew
some of these people, but not their death, as this list may ruin your
day, and lead to candle buying, or driving with your lights on, or
washing dishes without gloves for a week, depending upon your
geographical location. But since poets deaths are sorely under
publicized, from my memory, here goes those who went this year:

Pedro Pietri
Radoy Ralin
Carl Rakosi
Thom Gunn
Mattie Stepanek
Natan Yonatan
Marianne Halley Chametzky
Cid Corman

Be well

Five Months After US-led Coup, Mayhem Rules Haiti's Streets:
Roger Noriega Says "What The Fuck Do You Expect From Kidnappers?"
by Mikel Nambybear



They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

love
what do you do too me? Am I monk among heats of summer days
as if sometimes southern ways
are more sacred than stories
what does he say?
The man suffers love to give
and seeds to sow but doubts his madness
keeps pacing with a thought
that he only had one life to live
but he doubts something around him
in the air, sounds on grounds just now understood
and he wants to laugh at the offense
and find pardon in his actions
a guy in the south found a joke today... what do you call an Catholic
Anarchist?
funny
very funny... like all he wants to do is talk to a woman
and feels like the dumbest man in the world for it
no walking on grounds without sounds
that reflect the troubles in the trouble hearted.

>>PUB: anthology on women's writing seeks submissions
=============================================

For Their Own Purposes

An anthology of innovative women writers and their ideas on
writing


Purpose

Originally designed as a research project delving into the
use of rhythm as an instrument of cultural expression in the
creative work of women writers, For Their Own Purposes has
evolved into a metalinguistic venture concerning the
perceptions women writers have about their own work, about
the work of others, and about the field of contemporary
creative writing in general.

The goal of this project remains, however, to bring about a
new, interdisciplinary awareness of the ways in which
changes in culture have impacted, and continue to impact,
the work of American women writers. And conversely, the ways
in which women use writing to comment on those changes.

Format

A series of critical essays will be shaped by the project's
editor from the responses garnered to a survey on a myriad
of subjects related to the search for the nature
of "womanhood," specifically the cultural composite crafted
by women themselves in this regard in the field of writing.

In addition, some survey responses, either in full or in
part, will be included in the text of the anthology to
intertextualize and support these essays.  Some contributors
may be asked to lengthen their responses to include a full
essay on a particular topic, at the discretion of the
project's editor.

Finally, along with these metalinguistic rejoinders,
contemporary poems by women whose writing is demonstrative
of the innovative, cultural expressions the project is
seeking to investigate will be interspersed throughout the
essays to produce a cohesive text that personifies the
metalinguistic nature of the project.

The project will cohesively annotate the cultural changes
and innovations found in the poetry of women writers.  For
Their Own Purposes will represent a well-informed and
productive study by the disciplines it seeks to influence
possessing both academic and literary merit.


Survey

Please feel free to respond to these questions as briefly or
elaborately as you desire.  You may choose specific
questions to respond to or respond to the survey in full.

1.In your opinion, have women writers responded in any
discernibly patterned way to the cultural changes women have
experienced as a population group since the beginning of the
Twentieth Century?  If so, has this been a
conscious/deliberate response?

2.As a women writer, how do you define contemporary
womanhood?  How does your interpretation of it, or its
challenges and rewards, reveal itself in your writings
and/or in your interpretation of other women writers' work?

3.How would you define "innovative" writing?

4.Do you believe that a "feminine rhythm" exists?  Or
feminine sounds?  Or feminine forms?  Etc.? Why or why not?

5.How do you feel that the theory of essentialism, the idea
that women's writing always reflects some essential
characteristics of the population group, impacts the thesis
that women writing unconventionally may be doing so for
their own purposes?

6.Who, in your opinion, are the leading contemporary women
writers in so far as "innovation" and "cultural expression"
come into play?  Why?

7.Do you believe that "innovation" is conscious/deliberate?
Do you yourself think about writing in this way as you are
doing it?

8.At a time in literary history when "free verse" is
supposedly the predominant poetic form in use, how do you,
as a woman writer, account for recognizable forms appearing
in poetry by some contemporary women writers?  How do you
see the structural freedom of free verse impacting your own
work?

9.What predominant themes do you perceive in the work of
contemporary, innovative women writers and/or in your own
work that is self-reflexive, that is that it addresses the
role of women writers, i.e. power/control,
feminity/masculinity, etc.?  Are these themes exaggerated or
intensified in innovative poetic works?

10.What specific historical period comes to your mind when
you think about redefinition of "womanhood" and what poetry
from that period, by women writers, seems to support the use
of innovative writing as an expression of that redefinition
or women's struggle for or against it?

11.How do you see gender studies, or other academic
disciplines such as the humanities, actively rising to the
challenge of, or not dealing with, the need for a new
literary context through which the work of women writers can
be studied and appreciated against the scenery of history
and cultural change? Is there a need for a new lens through
which the writing of women may be viewed?

12.In your opinion, how has being a part, or not being a
part, of academe influenced the work of contemporary,
innovative women writers?

13.Lucky #13) What existing texts would you recommend for
someone wanting to study contemporary women writers and/or
contemporary women writing innovatively?


Call for Submissions

Poetry by contemporary women writers is being sought for a
critical anthology investigating the innovative ways in
which women are responding (consciously and unconsciously)
to the cultural changes they are experiencing as a
population group.  Please submit up to three poems with a
SASE, Acknowledgements, and a brief biography to P.O. Box
5648, Saginaw, MI 48603 (please note, if your work is
selected for publication you will need to provide it on 3.5"
floppy disk, or CD-R)  Formatting of submissions should
adhere to the following guidelines:

All forms of poetry are accepted;
Individual poems should not exceed sixty lines;
Title and pages number should appear in headers for multi-
page documents;
All entries should appear left justified;
Previously published works and simultaneous submissions are
accepted;
Previously published works should be cited.


Deadline

The deadline for submission of survey responses and poems is
October 15, 2004 (postmarked).  Writers and survey
contributors will be notified by December 15, 2004 of
acceptance.  Publication of the project is intended to occur
in the spring of 2005.

>>PUB: call for submissions--maafa reader
===================================

Call for submissions to the Maafa Reader Project

To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the San Francisco Bay Area's
"Black
Holocaust Remembrance," scholars, poets, writers, artists are invited to
submit
work for inclusion in this reader. The goal is to have a reflective
record of
the various ways African people in the Diaspora recall the Middle
Passage,
honor the ancestors, and heal the trauma.

Maafa is a Kiswahlli term that means great catastrophe or disaster, the
type
of unresolved trauma which reoccurs if not addressed.

We hope the response to the call is national and international drawing
on
those stories or residual memories, and consequences of having been
forcefully
removed from our homeland five centuries ago. The call is also for those
left in
Akebulan (Ancient name for Africa), to reflect on the devastation this
loss
was on families and communities left behind. What has this cultural
drain been
to the collective consciousness? What should or how does the New Afrikan
feel
in abstention? Who's responsible for our enslavement? Can we forgive
those who
sold us, those who bought us?

We are especially interested in the stories of incarcerated African men,
women,
and children in group homes and foster care. This in itself is its own
special type
of Maafa.

Reflect on the whole notion of freedom. What does it mean to be free?
And
while you're at it, what about what's due to those who labored for
centuries
without pay? Are reparations in order?

Choose your topic. There is no length requirement; just be clear,
succinct
and edited.

Files can be sent in Microsoft Word or doc. files.

Mail hardcopies to:
Anthology Editor
P.O. Box 30756
Oakland, CA 94604.

Please include a short, no more than 50 words, bio with your work.
You will be notified by March, 2005 as to whether of not your submission

was accepted.

Deadline: January 31, 2005.

The order of events:

Dick Cheney has fired his doctor. (Drug laundering, the charge).
He has undergone tests with his New Doctor.
Cheney's New Doctor has determined that he will not survive four more years
of Public(!) service.
Cheney announces his resignation (circa, August 15).
Either former Mayor Gullianni or Senator McCain will be chosen as the
replacement for the Vice President.

The questions:

1. Will Lynne Cheney permit the exit of her husband? Meryl Streep - as in
The Manchurian Candidate - would be good at acting out her opposition.
Lynne is going to lose a lot of candy and influence

2. Will ditching a Vice-President associated with Haliburton, the continued
defence of the Al-Queda/Iraq connection, etc., etc. be good enough to give
Bush an electable bounce?  In any case, either Gullianni or McCain are going
to look like opportunists or masochists depending one's perspective.


All the speculation that's fit to print! But, I suspect, the center and left
are going to have to shift to deal with this one.

The mask of altruism disguising a colonial war

Oil will be the driving factor for military intervention in Sudan

John Laughland
Monday August 2, 2004
The Guardian

http://www.guardian.co.uk/sudan/story/0,14658,1274182,00.html

If proof were needed that Tony Blair is off the hook over Iraq, it came
not during the Commons debate on the Butler report on July 21, but
rather at his monthly press conference the following morning. Asked
about the crisis in Sudan, Mr Blair replied: "I believe we have a moral
responsibility to deal with this and to deal with it by any means that
we can." This last phrase means that troops might be sent - as General
Sir Mike Jackson, the chief of the general staff, immediately confirmed
- and yet the reaction from the usual anti-war campaigners was silence.
Mr Blair has invoked moral necessity for every one of the five wars he
has fought in this, surely one of the most bellicose premierships in
history. The bombing campaign against Iraq in December 1998, the 74-day
bombardment of Yugoslavia in 1999, the intervention in Sierra Leone in
the spring of 2000, the attack on Afghanistan in October 2001, and the
Iraq war last March were all justified with the bright certainties which
shone from the prime minister's eyes. Blair even defended Bill Clinton's
attack on the al-Shifa pharmaceuticals factory in Sudan in August 1998,
on the entirely bogus grounds that it was really manufacturing anthrax
instead of aspirin.

Although in each case the pretext for war has been proved false or the
war aims have been unfulfilled, a stubborn belief persists in the
morality and the effectiveness of attacking other countries. The
Milosevic trial has shown that genocide never occurred in Kosovo -
although Blair told us that the events there were worse than anything
that had happened since the second world war, even the political
activists who staff the prosecutor's office at the international
criminal tribunal in The Hague never included genocide in their Kosovo
indictment. And two years of prosecution have failed to produce one
single witness to testify that the former Yugoslav president ordered any
attacks on Albanian civilians in the province. Indeed, army documents
produced from Belgrade show the contrary.

Like the Kosovo genocide, weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, as we now
know, existed only in the fevered imaginings of spooks and politicians
in London and Washington. But Downing Street was also recently forced to
admit that even Blair's claims about mass graves in Iraq were false. The
prime minister has repeatedly said that 300,000 or 400,000 bodies have
been found there, but the truth is that almost no bodies have been
exhumed in Iraq, and consequently the total number of such bodies, still
less the cause of their deaths, is simply unknown.

In 2001, we attacked Afghanistan to capture Osama bin Laden and to
prevent the Taliban from allegedly flooding the world with heroin. Yet
Bin Laden remains free, while the heroin ban imposed by the Taliban has
been replaced by its very opposite, a surge in opium production,
fostered by the warlords who rule the country. As for Sierra Leone, the
United Nations human development report for 2004, published on July 15,
which measures overall living standards around the world, puts that
beneficiary of western intervention in 177th place out of 177, an august
position it has continued to occupy ever since our boys went in: Sierra
Leone is literally the most miserable place on earth. So much for
Blair's promise of a "new era for Africa".

The absence of anti-war scepticism about the prospect of sending troops
into Sudan is especially odd in view of the fact that Darfur has oil.
For two years, campaigners have chanted that there should be "no blood
for oil" in Iraq, yet they seem not to have noticed that there are huge
untapped reserves in both southern Sudan and southern Darfur. As oil
pipelines continue to be blown up in Iraq, the west not only has a clear
motive for establishing control over alternative sources of energy, it
has also officially adopted the policy that our armies should be used to
do precisely this. Oddly enough, the oil concession in southern Darfur
is currently in the hands of the China National Petroleum Company. China
is Sudan's biggest foreign investor.

We ought, therefore, to treat with scepticism the US Congress
declaration of genocide in the region. No one, not even the government
of Sudan, questions that there is a civil war in Darfur, or that it has
caused an immense number of refugees. Even the government admits that
nearly a million people have left for camps outside Darfur's main towns
to escape marauding paramilitary groups. The country is awash with guns,
thanks to the various wars going on in Sudan's neighbouring countries.
Tensions have risen between nomads and herders, as the former are forced
south in search of new pastures by the expansion of the Sahara desert.
Paramilitary groups have practised widespread highway robbery, and each
tribe has its own private army. That is why the government of Sudan
imposed a state of emergency in 1999.

But our media have taken this complex picture and projected on to it a
simple morality tale of ethnic cleansing and genocide. They gloss over
the fact that the Janjaweed militia come from the same ethnic group and
religion as the people they are allegedly persecuting - everyone in
Darfur is black, African, Arabic-speaking and Muslim. Campaigners for
intervention have accused the Sudanese government of supporting this
group, without mentioning that the Sudanese defence minister condemned
the Janjaweed as "bandits" in a speech to the country's parliament in
March. On July 19, moreover, a court in Khartoum sentenced six Janjaweed
soldiers to horrible punishments, including the amputation of their
hands and legs. And why do we never hear about the rebel groups which
the Janjaweed are fighting, or about any atrocities that they may have
committed?

It is far from clear that the sudden media attention devoted to Sudan
has been provoked by any real escalation of the crisis - a peace
agreement was signed with the rebels in April, and it is holding. The
pictures on our TV screens could have been shown last year. And we
should treat with scepticism the claims made for the numbers of deaths -
30,000 or 50,000 are the figures being bandied about - when we know that
similar statistics proved very wrong in Kosovo and Iraq. The Sudanese
government says that the death toll in Darfur, since the beginning of
the conflict in 2003, is not greater than 1,200 on all sides. And why is
such attention devoted to Sudan when, in neighbouring Congo, the death
rate from the war there is estimated to be some 2 or 3 million, a
tragedy equalled only by the silence with which it is treated in our media?

We are shown starving babies now, but no TV station will show the
limbless or the dead that we cause if we attack Sudan. Humanitarian aid
should be what the Red Cross always said it must be - politically
neutral. Anything else is just an old-fashioned colonial war - the
reality of killing, and the escalation of violence, disguised with the
hypocritical mask of altruism. If Iraq has not taught us that, then we
are incapable of ever learning anything.

She said in Maine they're cheap, like candy in Mexico City.  Oh, they
were exquisite.  If only I could remember prices better I could tell
you how much they were, but no.  Ben (Friedlander) wasn't there, but
I caught up with him later.  And got them both to sign the copy of
their Italian Epigrams book I had hauled all the way from San
Francisco.  I met Ben way back when in the early days of everything,
and for his magazine "Jimmy and Lucy's House of K" I wrote my first
stumbling attempts to write notices of pop music.  I remember writing
about Janet Jackson's LP "Control," when was that?  And also another
article on "That's What Friends Are For" by Stevie Wonder, Dionne
Warwick, etc.  I think "Jimmy and Lucy" was the only magazine open to
printing such work back then, and Ben the only editor who encouraged
me to see what I could do critically, and I took to it and never
really quit after that and thus, I owe him a huge debt of gratitude.
I see now "Control" was released in 1986 and "That's What Friends Are
For" in 1985, so he has been helping me for almost 20 years.  Good
work Ben.

Then Carla drove us back to the campus and dropped us off.  It must
have been during a panel session or something because the whole
cafeteria was nearly deserted.  Alan and I jawed on and on about
everything under the sun.  In his unruly mop of long curls he looked
a little like Jesus Christ.  He's pale too, and has a long face like
an odalisque, and big dark eyes that take in the whole world with
what looks like sadness but may be something else, fortitude perhaps,
or hope.  Whichever, he's very striking.  We had a great time because
I'm such a fan, to me it was like going out to lunch with, oh I don't
know, John Cusack or someone.  Or Dave Muller.  Alan showed me
pictures of his daughter Sophie, now one year old; we talked vaguely
about our plans for the future.

Then we went to room 101 where, with trepidation, I manned the slide
projector thinking to myself, I've seen nerds of all description do
this with ease, I should be able to handle it!  Alas it was not to be
so, and most of Alan's beautiful slides of Philip Guston and Ben
Shahn and everything else needed someone to jump over my shoulder and
re-adjust the focus for me.  That simple focus button had so many
fingers on it by the time I was through, never was one man aided by
so many Good Samaritans, but was my face red!  I was never one of
those A/V boys, that seems clear, but when I think of all the time I
spent glued to the screen, and on Albigensianism, you'd think I'd
know more about how to get light from dark.

Alan Gilbert urged us not to overlook the aesthetics of the Popular
Front and the New Deal as influences in Charles Olson's work.  He
showed slides that began with a pretty good rundown of the graphic
layout of Olson's very first book.  Here I thought that book must be
Call Me Ishmael but Gilbert showed slides of a pamphlet mass produced
by the US government called "Spanish Speaking Americans in the War,"
a collaboration with the radical painter Ben Shahn, though signed by
neither.  The pages we saw were extremely striking in that stark
Margaret Bourke-White way, with plenty of spiritual gung-ho from
Olson.  Over the course of the 50s, Ben Shahn found his mass public
draining away, and even Olson seemed to tire of him, even though he
once acclaimed Olson as his favorite, miles above Motherwell,
Rauschenberg and the "other little shit painters."  Barrett Watten's
talk on "Olson's Historicism" was just as interesting, and fit along
the borders of Gilbert's talk like two spoons, based as it was on
Olson viewed as a historical poet.  Watten's insistence on two
versions of historicism, a "historicism in" and a "historicism of"
confused me at the time but as I think on it, it makes sense now.  He
identifies the importance to Olson's project of "an unfolding logic
of prospection and substitution: as the scale of the work grows
larger, there is increasing pressure on historical fact as object of
desire."  And again, the insistence on the unique man or woman-The
"host of 'isolatoes' who refused to be absorbed by official history
and tradition."  What's great about Watten is that he always works on
two registers at once, in this case, we could see him building a life
portrait of Olson with the delicacy and detail of Singer Sargent or
someone, and at the same time he was nudging our picture of Olson's
thinking so we could spot its peaks and valleys over the troughs of
successive postmodernisms.  Everything seemed to fit into itself at
the end, like Russian kachina dolls, and there was a lot of reference
to China's favorite theorist Frederic Jameson.  Lytle Shaw, our
moderator, had hardly time to get many questions in, so we left
buzzing with them.  At the very end, while we were streaming out,
Robert Creeley asked if he could see Alan's slide of the piece of
paper, which RC said he had never seen before, in which Olson had
scrawled what some say was his very last poem, "My wife my car my
color and myself."  (It's from the fabled Olson archive at Storrs.)
The slide rose to the screen and clung there, as though about to fall
precipitously.  In my Gothic imagination it really did look like
someone in extremis wrote it.

Hooray, that wonderful Andrew Epstein brought me a copy of my review
from RAIN TAXI of my new book ISLAND OF LOST SOULS.  I went back and
sat in the Staar Club reading it, memorizing it.  And it turned out,
believe it or not, that the review was indeed written by someone I
hadn't paid to write it.

We then held the candlelight march for Carl Rakosi.  Because it was
raining, Burt Hatlen suggested holding the "march" in one place and
everyone could stand around in a sacred half-circle of sorts.  I
passed out the candles and lit them with Barbara Cole's lighter, or
mourners tipped an unlit candle into a lit one, the wicks united in
flame.  The resulting spectacle was remarkably beautiful, as the
gilded mirrors of the wall behind us doubled the number of candles.
I watched the faces of all the people I had come to know over the
past few days.  Burt spoke, as did Creeley, Hejinian, Sylvester
Pollet, Burt Kimmelman, Al Filreis.  Each of them read a poem or two,
contributed some memories.  Lyn said that Amoeba Records, in Rakosi's
neighborhood here in San Francisco, would be missing an important
customer, for he bought 3 or 4 CDs every day to listen to.  Man,
that's a lot of CDs.  One woman, who had known Leah Rakosi, murmured
darkly, "Where were the candles when Leah died?"

I thought of how I had bullied everyone into this memorial.  But as
it turned out, even the once skeptical thanked me for the
follow-through.  Wish you could see my photos of this event.
Afterwards I had a few minutes to myself so I got out my treat, an
article I had ripped out of a magazine on the plane (ELLE June
issue), the article was all about Scarlet Johansson and it seemed to
hint very strongly that not only did Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray
freeze her out after they were done making Lost in Translation with
her, but that none of her co-stars like her and that she's horrible.
Behind her back they call her "Starlet" Johansson.  I never knew
that!  Well it seems there are two kinds of people, one of them
thinks Lost in Translation a great movie and Scarlet Johansson
America's greatest actress, and the other group is like night and day.

Then came time for the central event of the Conference, the black tie
Lobster Banquet.  Indeed you didn't have to wear black tie, though
many dressed up beautifully, many came as slobs, and I looked like
such a mess.  The banquet was fun.  We had a nice table with Peter
Middleton, Doug Rothschild, Steve and Jennifer, Miriam, mmm, I can't
remember who all else.  I was just tucking into this big hearty steak
thing when Aldon Nielsen came over and nabbed me.  "You are busted!"
he said.  "You of all people shouldn't be eating steak, my friend."
In his exhortations I heard a distant echo of the AA I'd escaped, but
he was 100% right, having had problems with his heart too, and right
on it.  I pushed it away and concentrated on the entertainment, which
proved to be a series of speakers (Creeley, Perelman, Perloff among
others) toasting the memory of two who had been important to the
National Poetry Foundation-one of them Hugh Kenner and the other
Carroll Terrell, whom they all called "Terry."  To be honest, "Terry"
sounded like a terror and Hugh Kenner no prize either.  They all
acted as if writing for the National Review was some charming
eccentricity like smoking a pipe.  I heard Kenner give the Oppen
Lecture here at San Francisco State one time.  He gave the impression
of a man slumming in San Francisco of all places.  His speech was on
the "Little Words" of Oppen, for he had counted how many times "a"
and "the" were used in Oppen's Collected Poems.  My experience with
Carroll Terrell was more limited, and limited to the environs of
Orono.  They said he had asked to have a door put in between his
office and that of Hatlen, to save them the labor of walking out into
the hallway, and when University approval for this door wasn't
forthcoming, he hired workmen to slam down the wall and carve out a
door-sized shape.  It was an interesting story, redolent of sex
passion at its most primitive, and perhaps borrowed from a similar
story in Our Lady of the Flowers?  Others not invited to speak said
that Terry had been a gay man without a gay identity in this
backwater of Maine, and that in old age he had finally approached
Allen Ginsberg with a plaintive question, "How do I get to be 'gay'?"
to which Allen had no answer.  Remarkable was his will and
indomitable his spirit.  I guess my hat goes off to him but I'm like,
wow, glad I didn't have to work under him, I'd be exhausted.  However
these two did leave behind these super works far bigger than anything
I'll ever do, so what's the difference?  One speaker remembered how
Kenner was scandalized, for he had brought his family to the
conference, at one NPF event at which an epigone of Ginsberg had
stripped off his clothes suddenly.  Eventually Terry had Allen
apologize to Kenner for this behavior.  Is it me or have you, too,
been to too many memorials lately where speaker after speaker comes
up with tales that make you loathe the dead?  Think I first noticed
this at Dan Davidson's memorial where twelve speakers in a row
admitted to not being on speaking terms with him at the time of his
death.  Thus the word "speaker" itself finds a new meaning within
itself.

Then I finally decided that, Vic or no, Queer as Folk or no, I was
not going to go to the play about the Bishop-Lowell letters.  That
one I'm going to wait to see on the TRIO channel.   Instead we went
to the open cash bar at Doris Twitchell Allen Village.  To our
surprise, no one had shown up with any alcohol.  Previously every
night students would act as bartenders, very professional, with
bottles of wine, etc.  Lyn came in and assessed the damage.  She is
wonderfully practical and announced that she would go to the liquor
store and buy enough booze to have our own party, so everyone gave
her five dollars, ten dollars, whatever, and after gathering $180
away she sailed in full regalia, coming back about twenty minutes
later with cases of liquor, everything you could imagine, enough for
a posse of clergymen loose in Atlantic City.  After a few drinks the
noise got out of hand.  The camaraderie grew exponentially.  I hadn't
had a drink in many years and I realized, tonight is really going to
be the acid test.  Things kind of lost focus for me.  I remember
talking so much my mouth felt weird the next day.  I suppose I felt
drunk without drinking.  We just kept talking and talking and pretty
soon, because we were so far North I guess, the sun started to turn
the night pink and then blue and yellow.  I'm going to skip over this
part because I can't remember all the people I talked to and listened
to.

Sunday, June 27, 2004
I missed the opening panel session, thus I know I missed some very
good papers, but out of curiosity I just couldn't miss the plenary
session in which Theodore Enslin read from his poetry.  He's a poet
of whom I knew very little except that he had written hundreds of
books, some of which I had glanced at with the dismissive cruelty of
youth, seeing nothing there that I could use for my own self, but
now, with my new maturity, I decided to give him another try.  No one
from the outside world could miss Enslin's resemblance to the old
fisherman in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, the one with the hook
on his hand and that yellow raincoat dripping with blood.  I thought
he was pretty spooky.  The rumor was that he is secretly a
multimillionaire who won a huge settlement in a class action suit,
and/or that he owns the biggest cranberry bog in Maine.  Reactions to
his reading style were sharply divided.  Was he a master of hypnotic,
sensuous, telling observation, a Nadia Boulanger of the word, or was
he repeating himself compulsively, like a rabbit with a hiccup?  The
reading went quickly and resulting in another standing ovation-the
second I'd witnessed with my own two eyes during the course of five
days.

Then I went to the room next door and caught a lot of the "Poets of
Maine" reading.  Here 14 or 15 locals poets stood up and read in a
space that looked like an operating theater.  Many of them took the
opportunity to dedicate a poem to the now celebrated Margaret Avison,
who sat right in one of the front rows with her companion, June.
They thanked her for coming to Orono, which was very polite and the
right thing to do.  I heard all kinds of poetry and wondered to
myself what it would be like to be a Maine resident, because some of
the poems seemed to inspire such speculation.  Some came right out
and suggested Maine was really Moloch, but that I knew already from
my dedication to Stephen King's novels.  And some made it seem like
Paradise.  Burt Hatlen said to me, "Now are you going back to San
Francisco to write up this conference?  We expect a novel from you."
I said I would try but not to expect a novel.  He was just funning I
know.  Then I went back to Main Street to say goodbye to my two hosts
who gave me directions back to the airport.  For it was time for me
to go.

The airport was swarming with big Marines on their way to Panama
City.  They crowded the sinks in the men's room, shaving and sprucing
up.  Several of them were distinctly bookish, huddling around the
gift shop's stack of Stephen King's latest novel, while others bought
out the new issue of Maxim with Anna Nicole Smith on the cover.  I
kept thinking, Anna Nicole!  She could be your mother.  Kelly Holt
was on the same flight with me and we were both booked for Chicago,
layover, then out to San Francisco.

We walked through the Northwest Terminal past the Isamu Noguchi
sculpture and then I saw Dodie, waving at us and I was home.  I got
back in time to go to the funeral of the poet Christopher Hewitt, a
graduate of the famous Iowa Writers Workshop, who was disabled and
who rolled about San Francisco in a motorized wheelchair with a big
Union Jack tacked onto it, terrorizing everyone.  Lots of candles
everywhere.  One man got up and said, "I'd like to read a poem, by
Rudyard Kipling, that Chris loved."  And he recited it from memory, a
grand feat.  But I'm all like, that isn't by Kipling, but I didn't
know who it was by:

See how, beneath the moonbeam's smile,
Yon little billow heaves its breast,
And foams and sparkles for a while,
Then murmuring subsides to rest!

Thus man, the sport of bliss and care,
Rises on time's eventful sea,
And having swelled a moment there,
Thus melts into eternity.

Sam Tanenhaus, the new editor of the NY Times Book Review, is
interviewed in MediaBistro.com
(http://mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a2101.asp) and has this little
exchange about poetry:

"How about poetry? How does poetry fit into the mix as part of modern
literature?

We are now in the planning stages of a major issue focusing on poetry,
because it is an essential part of the literary tradition we are living
in. Poetry doesn't have the immediate authority that other kinds of
writing do, but our objective is to introduce readers to poetry as a
vital part of contemporary literature."



My question is: what does he mean by Immediate Authority?

I'd suspect Tanenhaus is implying something like: Poetry
will have nothing (short of some weak, distant butterfly effect)
to do to alter the events of the coming four years... and beyond.

As of 8/4/04 everything (anything) with any authentic authority
should be deployed immediately (see Kari Edward's message of
urgency)... and poety's not in the running to be called up.

FRIED SPECULARITY


Fusion of Courbet & his dog suggests
right hand & wrist at the center of the composition
into the canvas carrying a brush loaded with paint.
Expanded & explicit self-portraits of the painting working in
depictions of left & right within “The Stonebreakers”.

Search
pursuing very nearly anti-theatrical interiors rises
exactly as the theatre—the “Diderotion” does not apply.
Courbet the Ideal would be to bypass the mirror entirely
understood as such / seem openly evolved
light reflective mirror-like from the surface.
A privilege placed in both artists’ oeuvres.
Respective tasks which
I have interpreted images of the body.
Two theoretical observations.
You can’t make that left hand really be there.

Written during art historian & poet Michael Fried's lecture entitled
"Immersion and Specularity".  Wanting to continue the possibility of serial
acrostic and/or diastic sonnets as a "writing performance" during his six
Mellon lectures, I finally concocted a title which would yield a "sixteener"
as well as invoke Gus Blaisdell (founder of "The Living Batch" press &
bookstore) who had told me of his interest in publishing a book by Michaed
Fried during what turned out to be our last conversation.  You can access a
rather recent poetry reading by Michael Fried at the University of

Immediate Authority rests in the ability to communique effectively through a
medium (particularly one not saturated with gliches and external controls).
If a medium has powerful external controls, then the message may be two fold
or have multiple implications not directly understood by audience/
participant. However, if the ability (in this particular case poetry) has
been effectively established as the only means to communicate one thing
(let's say revolution), then an un-mediated authority can always be trusted.
Say billy joe is guy numero uno (let's play mafia for a bit) & his only
purpose is too raise a red flag in front of his house when there is trouble.
If he walks down the street and casually says to a younger guy or women
(let's assume a relay man) "The weather is good today." It could be raining
or it could be the hottest day of the year, but due to the nature of the
communication, what the man has just said could be considered poetry because
poetry is more a matter of intention than intent. In other words, there is
no distinguishing characteristic to poetry, only how it means. Authority is
always immediate and present. Kind of like a clear and present danger.
Peace,
Ian
PS. Also, a list serve archive would be what Jaques Derrida has called "the
new book." Editing of the content of the list serve also constitutes an
editing of the "book" and destroys one possible function for list serves as
historical and literary reference.

Hello all,

I've just joined the list and thought I'd introduce myself.

I'm a Canadian writer & composer living in Hamilton, Ontario. I've
published several fiction collections, a collaborative novel (with Stuart
Ross), numerous chapbooks & small press ephemera, and two poetry
collections from Coach House Books (Outside the Hat, and Raising
Eyebrows.)  I've been involved with small press around Toronto for around
20 years.

I have a Ph.D. in music composition (from UB). Much of my music focusses
on the interaction of text and music, often mediated by computers. On a
clear day, my large intestine looks like my small intestine and my small
intestine looks like my large intestine, depending on your perspective.

Last week, I attended a large gathering in support of Coach House. As you
may know, their "landlord," a U of Toronto affiliated cooperative housing
needs to create new housing spaces for students and so wants to tear down
at least some of  Coach House's venerable coach house buildings on
bpNichol Lane to make way for new buildings. The gathering today was
fantastic in that, in addition to "civilians," several generations of
Canadian writers were there -- "first generation" Coach Housers like
Victor Coleman & David McFadden, but then second and third generations
too. A fantastic showing of support from almost 40 years of forward
thinking Canadian literary history. And there was free beer! (The petition
to support Coach House is at www.chbooks.com/savech )

I look forward to following & participating in this list.

Best,

Gary

Harold Pinter's verses against the invasion of Iraq (specifically for
his collection of poetry entitled WAR, published in 2003) have helped
earn him one of the highest accolades for a modern writer on war.



God Bless America (January 2003)

Here they go again,
The Yanks in their armoured parade
Chanting their ballads of joy
As they gallop across the big world
Praising America's God.

The gutters are clogged with the dead
The ones who couldn't join in
The others refusing to sing
The ones who are losing their voice
The ones who've forgotten the tune.

The riders have whips which cut.
Your head rolls onto the sand
Your head is a pool in the dirt
Your head is a stain in the dust
Your eyes have gone out and your nose
Sniffs only the pong of the dead
And all the dead air is alive
With the smell of America's God.




Democracy (February 2003)

There's no escape.
The big pricks are out.
They'll fuck everything in sight.
Watch your back.




Weather Forecast (March 2003)

The day will get off to a cloudy start.
It will be quite chilly
But as the day progresses
The sun will come out
And the afternoon will be dry and warm.

In the evening the moon will shine
And be quite bright.
There will be, it has to be said,
A brisk wind
But it will die out by midnight.
Nothing further will happen.

This is the last forecast.

Subject: An invitation to 2004 Buffalo Indie Lit Luau - October 1-2


The Council of Literary Magazines & Presses (CLMP) invites you all back =
to Buffalo for the:

2004 Buffalo Indie Lit Luau

October 1-2, 2004 9am-4pm
Medaille College
18 Agassiz Circle
(Parkside Avenue and Rte. 198)
Buffalo, NY

This year's two-day event is presented by Medaille College, SLOPE/Slope =
Editions, and Starcherone Books. Once again, it will be a showcase of =
America's best independent publishers, with a book fair, panels, =
workshops, and readings all day both days - as well as special evening =
events both nights.

Last year's Buffalo Indie Lit Luau drew several hundred indie =
publishers, bookstore owners, readers, and writers for two days of =
celebration of small press fiction and poetry--and this year's event =
should be even bigger! The keynote readers will be award-winning writers =
Denise Duhamel and Raymond Federman, and publishers expected to attend =
include BlazeVox, BOA Editions, Book Thug, Ecopoetics, FC2, The Gig, =
Kiosk, Maissoneuve, Parakeet, Rain Taxi, Verse Press, White Pine Press, =
and many more!

So, you ask, how can I participate in The 2004 Buffalo Indie Lit Luau? =
It's easy (and free!) Magazines and presses interested in participating =
must register by September 10th. To do so, simply complete the one-page =
online registration form at:

http://www.clmp.org/fairform.html

Whether you are a publisher located in the greater American north or the =
"Great North" (a.k.a. Canada), or from another region entirely and =
simply looking to expand your name and audience, the Buffalo Indie Lit =
Luau is a great publicity opportunity for your publication.

Even if you are unable to attend the 2004 Buffalo Indie Lit Luau, you =
can still send copies of your journal to ensure your presence! Thus, =
please take a minute to fill out the easy online registration form at:

http://www.clmp.org/fairform.html

Again, interested magazines and presses must register online by =
September 10th.

Space is limited, so the event organizers do need commitments from you =
as soon as possible. Note: The Buffalo Indie Lit Luau is being =
coordinated by presenters located in Buffalo, SLOPE/Slope Editions and =
Starcherone Books--not CLMP. All queries regarding the event should be =
made to Ethan Paquin of Slope Editions via email at: =
epaquin@medaille.edu.

Once registered, you will receive confirmation of your registration and =
further instructions on when and where to send your books and/or =
journals (do not send them before instructed to do so, please), as well =
as tips for getting the most out of the weekend and methods by which you =
can help spread the word about the 2004 Buffalo Indie Lit Luau.

The 2004 Buffalo Indie Lit Luau is free and open to the public. Initial =
program details are available at:

http://www.clmp.org/news/092603.html

All events are free and open to the public. For information, directions, =
and a complete itinerary, please visit http://www.medaille.edu/bill or =
call 716-884-3411 x152.

Hoping you head back to Buffalo!

The Case Against George W. Bush
The son of the fortieth president of the United States takes a hard look
at the son of the forty-first and does not like what he sees
by Ron Reagan

http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0804-14.htm


It may have been the guy in the hood teetering on the stool, electrodes
clamped to his genitals. Or smirking Lynndie England and her leash. Maybe
it was the smarmy memos tapped out by soft-fingered lawyers itching to
justify such barbarism. The grudging, lunatic retreat of the neocons from
their long-standing assertion that Saddam was in cahoots with Osama didn't
hurt. Even the Enron audiotapes and their celebration of craven sociopathy
likely played a part. As a result of all these displays and countless
smaller ones, you could feel, a couple of months back, as summer spread
across the country, the ground shifting beneath your feet. Not unlike that
scene in The Day After Tomorrow, then in theaters, in which the giant ice
shelf splits asunder, this was more a paradigm shift than anything
strictly tectonic. No cataclysmic ice age, admittedly, yet something was
in the air, and people were inhaling deeply. I began to get calls from
friends whose parents had always voted Republican, "but not this time."
There was the staid Zbigniew Brzezinski on the staid NewsHour with Jim
Lehrer sneering at the "Orwellian language" flowing out of the Pentagon.
Word spread through the usual channels that old hands from the days of
Bush the Elder were quietly (but not too quietly) appalled by his son's
misadventure in Iraq. Suddenly, everywhere you went, a surprising number
of folks seemed to have had just about enough of what the Bush
administration was dishing out. A fresh age appeared on the horizon,
accompanied by the sound of scales falling from people's eyes. It felt
something like a demonstration of that highest of American prerogatives
and the most deeply cherished American freedom: dissent.

The Annual Transcontinental Poetry Award by Pavement Saw Press

All contributors to the contest will receive at least one free book.
Please mention this to your friends, students and others who might be
interested!

Each year Pavement Saw Press will seek to publish at least one book of
poetry and/or prose poems from
manuscripts received during this competition. Selection is made
anonymously through a competition that is open
to anyone who has not previously published a volume of poetry or prose.
The author receives $1000 and a
percentage of the press run. Previous judges have included Judith
Vollmer, David Bromige, Bin Ramke and
Howard McCord. All poems must be original, all prose must be original,
fiction or translations are not
acceptable. Writers who have had volumes of poetry and/or prose under 40
pages printed or printed in limited
editions of no more than 500 copies are eligible. Submissions are
accepted during the months of June, July, and
until August 15th. All submissions must have an August 15th, 2004, or
earlier, postmark. This is an award for
first books only.

Entries must meet these requirements:

1. The manuscript should be at least 48 pages of poetry and no more than
70 pages of poetry in length.
Separations between sections are not a part of the page count.

2. A one page cover letter which includes a brief biography, the book's
title, your name, address, and telephone
number, your signature, and, if you have e-mail, your e-mail address.
This should be followed by a page which
lists publication acknowledgments for the book. For each acknowledgement
mention the publisher (journal,
anthology, chapbook etc.) and the poem published.

3. The manuscript should be bound with a single clip and begin with a
title page including the book's title, your
name, address, and telephone number, and, if you have e-mail, your
e-mail address.

4. The second page should have only the title of the manuscript. There
are to be no acknowledgments or mention
of the author's name from this page forward. Submissions to the contest
are judged anonymously.

5. The manuscript should be paginated, beginning with the first page of
poetry.

6. There should be no more than one poem on each page. The manuscript
can contain pieces that are longer than
one page.

Your manuscript should be accompanied by a check in the amount of $18.00
made payable to Pavement Saw
Press. All US contributors to the contest will receive at least one
book. Add $3 (US) for other countries to cover
the extra postal charge. Do not include an SASE for notification of
results, this information will be sent with the
free book. While the judge will choose the prize winner, usually another
anonymous manuscript is chosen by the
editor, if enough entries arrive. This “editors choice” manuscript will
be published under a standard royalty
contract. A decision will be reached in October. Books will be published
in 2005. Do not send the only copy of
your work. All manuscripts will be recycled and individual comments on
the manuscripts cannot be made.
Entries should be sent to:

..|  Poetry doesn't have the immediate authority
..|  that other kinds of writing do...




Less than 12% of the American population reads or listens to poetry:
http://www.nea.gov/pub/ReadingAtRisk.pdf (692K)

For the common reader, poetry often requires too much focus to read, too
much time to digest, and too much imagination to appreciate.

Worst of all is that poetry is creative -- a mismatch with America's
conveyor-belt demand for the ephemeral (think professional party-slut
Paris Hilton ;-)


I imagine that if poetry rhymed, as a general rule, or otherwise
displayed some type of *markedly* short-lived and continual mediocrity
(convention), that would get you on the Times best-sellers list. I
posted an article about that.

In describing his creative process, novelist Jack Kerouac said, "The first
thought is the best thought." When Allen Ginsberg was asked "What's the best
advice you can give a poet?", he echoed Kerouac. On the other hand, Nobel
Prize-winning writer William Butler Yeats constantly revised works he had
already published, even fiddling with poems that were many years old. Pierre
Bonnard was so committed to editing himself that "he was once caught trying
to retouch one of his own paintings hanging on a museum wall," wrote poet
Linh Dinh, who concluded, "Last thought is the best thought." While there
are valid arguments for both views, Leo, the astrological omens say your
best bet for now is to go the way of Kerouac and Ginsberg.

Subject: Huge Assault on America's Wild Forests      SEND ACTION~a20200u30516

Action deadline:   September 14, 2004

Dear Alan,

We've gone from bad to worse.  Over the past four years, the Bush administration has systematically undermined the Clinton-era rule that protected our nation's 58 million acres of wild and pristine national forest roadless areas from road building and logging.  Now, the Forest Service wants to throw the roadless rule out and not protect these areas unless governors successfully petition the federal government to have the areas off limits.  If they want, governors can request more roads and logging than the federal government is already planning.  The end result would be an unprecedented give-away to the timber industry.

The Forest Service will accept public comments until September 14 before coming up with a final rule.  This is your chance to let the administration know how important protecting roadless areas is to you.

Our nation's roadless areas shelter wildlife, protect freshwater supplies for local communities, and provide many other priceless benefits.  A World Wildlife Fund-led analysis showed that three-quarters of our nation's roadless areas have the potential to conserve threatened, endangered, or imperiled species.

Sadly, the U.S. national forest system is already crisscrossed by 380,000 miles of roads totaling more than eight times the national interstate highway system (and enough to circle the planet more than 16 times).  These forest roads break up habitat, cause soil erosion, and leave fragmented stands of timber vulnerable to disease and unnatural fire events.  The Forest Service estimates that without the roadless rule, Americans could lose as much as 6 million acres of roadless forestland over the next 20 years.

FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW TO SEND A FREE LETTER TO THE U.S. FOREST SERVICE.

Please forward this alert to your friends and colleagues.

USDA Forest Service
P.O. Box 221090

Dear Content Analysis Team:

I strongly object to the proposed new roadless area rule.  Instead, I urge you to reinstate the original roadless rule as it was issued in January 2001, which called for the protection of 58 million acres of national forest roadless areas.

The proposed new rule would be extremely damaging:  It provides no roadless area protection unless governors can successfully petition for it and allows governors to request more road building, logging, and energy development than currently included in forest management plans.  The proposed rule abdicates important federal responsibility:  Protecting our national forests is the job of the Forest Service, not the responsibility of governors who don't have the staff or expertise.  The new rule will result in inconsistent and piecemeal approaches to the protection of valuable federal resources.

The American public has long made known its strong support for roadless areas.  Ninety percent of the 2.2 million comments the Forest Service received during its extensive outreach effort on the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule supported the strongest protection possible for these wild lands.

Roadless areas in our national forests are vital resources that must be protected.  They provide refuge for wildlife, reservoirs for plant life, and protection for freshwater supplies for local communities.

Contrary to what some have suggested, forest fire prevention is not a reason to override protection of roadless areas.  Roadless areas are not a priority for forest fire fuels treatment since the risk of unnatural fires is much lower in these regions and most are miles from urban areas where fuels reduction treatments are urgently needed.

Please do all you can to safeguard our nation's wild roadless areas.

Sincerely,

Your name and address
will be inserted here

BACKGROUND

How has the Bush administration responded to the landmark Clinton administration forest conservation rule that prevented new road building and logging within 58 million acres of wild national forest lands and was overwhelmingly supported by the public?  First, the Bush administration refused to implement the rule or to defend it against an industry-inspired court challenge, leaving it to environmental groups to stand up for the rule in court.  Then, it exempted 15.5 million acres in Alaska from the rule's protections.  And, recently it decided to allow the logging of 8,000 acres of ecologically valuable roadless land -- the largest entry into roadless areas since the enactment of the rule -- as part of the Biscuit Fire salvage logging project in southern Oregon.

Now, the administration has proposed throwing the rule out altogether and allowing federal plans for road building and logging in roadless forests to go forward unless governors petition to block these actions (with the proviso that the administration can overrule the governors' requests).

Please send your comment to the Forest Service today.

Yes, this message is important and should be addressed. But, there is another
equally important place that needs to be saved and it is in our own western
New York backyard: the scenic preservation of Niagara Falls, the gorge and the
rim.

Currently, the Parks Commission of Niagara Falls, Canada is proposing a
gondola be built from the top of the gorge down to the bottom. They claim there
will be little significant damage, but Old Growth Forests line the walls of the
gorge. The Niagara River corridor is also a major bird migration route
recognized by the Audubon Society. To me, and others, this would cause more than a
little significant damage.

On our US side is an ongoing push for our officials to recognize we are the
stewards of this waterfall for the world. And, Niagara Falls should be
protected, treasured for future generations, in the Frederick Law Olmstead tradition.

If you support this, please go to www.niagaraheritage.org and sign the
petition. Enhance your support with comments, and by encouraging others to sign the
Niagara Heritage Partnership petition.

There is a great deal of information on the website. Scroll down and take the
time to read what this preservation group is undertaking.

Additional information from a Canadian website is

Besides various OULIPO projects, there's also "Making Shapely
Fiction," by Jerome Stern which has fifteen "shapes" or plot
structures, as well as a short guide of what not to do and a
list of fiction related definitions.  It's a good how-to book.

Hey everyone, thanks for the feedback I've gotten from my report on
the recent Poetry conference in Orono, both from those who were there
and those who weren't.  I do have some corrections to make.  Steve
Shoemaker assures me that the rumors going around about Ted Enslin's
secret wealth are categorically false.  "He lives a very
close-to-the-bone Thoreauvian life in the Maine woods, just outside a
small town on the coast, and is certainly no millionaire.  He did
once own, and work, a small cranberry bog, but now he just has a few
acres of blueberries out back and a garden."  In this vein I was also
unfair to Carroll ("Terry") Terrell who founded the National Poetry
Foundation.  Marjorie Perloff writes, "Without Terry, THERE WOULD NOT
NOW BE AN ORONO conference!!  The whole National Poetry Center was
his brainchild; he did the whole thing on a shoestring and kept it
going for years and years.  He's the one who got money to bring
Zukofsky and Rakosi, Creeley and Ginsberg etc.  At that time, Burt
[Hatlen] was a junior prof who more or less worked for Terry.  Terry
was pretty manic and wild and could be very difficult, as Burt
pointed out, but he was also the engine behind the whole operation.
And he ran the conferences brilliantly."  My apologies to all I
offended (and I was about to add, "and to all those I have yet to
offend," but that would be Jesuitical wouldn't it).

A question for the list admin here: how is a 'day' defined in relation to
the list? It can seem, in other time zones, that some people post more than
two messages per day, so does the 'day' have set parameters? It would be
helpful if it was given in relation to GMT, which is at least a common not a
localised frame of reference, as in hours plus or minus.

All the Best

Beard of Bees Press is pleased to announce the publication of our latest
chapbook: "Tongue's Needle" by H. Patrick Glumm, using Gnoetry, America's
finest computer generated poetry program.  From Mr. Glumm's preface:

"Eliminating responsibility as a category for describing the creative act is one
of the things that sets the gnoetry program apart from other text production
software. For gnoetry, as I understand it, shifts some portion of the
responsibility of composition back upon the author(s) of the text(s) from which
it draws. The need for parenthetical plurality here helps to suggest how gnoetry
does this. A gnoetic text is composed of the labor of several authors. What you
get when you generate new text is not just the labor of Jon [Trowbridge] and
Eric [Elshtain], who wrote and conceived of the program, nor just of them and
yourself, the present  author,  nor just of them and yourself and the  original
 authors of the books from which you are generating work, but of ALL of these
AND of all of the authors who influenced the writers of the source text and the
qualities of your own, later text. It is difficult to describe this because we
tend to think of non-authorial text as  random,  but gnoetry is far from this
and that s before you intervene."

Subject:      poet for beach
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

On Sunday August 15, 2004 join "poet and friends on the beach !"

Details:
From Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) Penn Station entrance on 34th Street and
7th Avenue. Go to ticket counter and ask for : "One Day Fun Pass to Sunken
Forest, Fire Island". The cost is $21.00. You will receive the following tickets a.
a round trip railroad ticket (New York to Sayville/ Sayville to New York) b.
two coupons for Colonial taxi c. a ticket for the ferry from Sayville to
Sunken Forest.

How to do it:

Pack up your beach gear ! Sunblock, bottled water, lunch, towel etc.
Get tickets from counter as above.
Depart on the 9:46 AM train to Sayville, change at Jamaica to double decker
train, arrive Sayville11:13 AM. At Sayville train station board a shuttle van
to ferry. Make sure the van says Colonial Taxi or Colonial on the side. One of
the coupons is your payment for this. When you get to the ferry's you have
three choices: 1. go to Sunken Forest, a national park within the national park,
there are changing rooms and showers at this part of the island. Also a place
to eat. 2. go to The Pines via the Pines Ferry or 3. go to Cherry Grove via
the Cherry Grove Ferry.
If you want to go to the Pines or the Grove simply tell the person in the
booth that you changed your mind and would like to go to ex. "the Pines" instead.
(Make sure you are in the right ferry line). They will charge you an
additional $6.00. You will hand them the ferry coupon you have from the LIRR ticket
counter. Keep the new ticket they give you as this is a round trip and you'll
need it for return.

Board Ferry ! Take snapshot's of your friends ! Hold onto hats ! Some people
start greasing up now.

Land at "the Pines" dis-embark from the ferry. Last stop to get provisions
(the Pantry) expect crazy prices here, use the facilities (restroom located in
the coffee shop), walk to the beach.

poet and friends will be in the Pines on the ocean side. Follow the boardwalk
street "Atlantic Walk" straight (HA !) ahead to the Atlantic Ocean. Take a
right and look for purple and aqua blue blanket, a guy with a tan and white
striped beach hat ! We will be parked approximately in front of a beach house set
back from the ocean with a flag of a "pink elephant" on a green background as
I remember. This is about five or six houses to the right as you leave the
Atlantic walk boardwalk.

swimming : yes !

Thank you to Harry Nudel for his poem ! Thank you to Brenda Iijima for
planting the seed !

peace,

Nathaniel A. Siegel

Dear David, I agree that using GMT makes more sense but unfortunately
the listserv software (or the university) has everything set to
eastern standard time and this is something I can't change.

Lori, that's fine, I wasn't thinking that you could change it! If memory
serves me right EST is minus 5 against GMT, as long as we all know what the
common denominator is there's no probs. For instance, I'm on BST au moment,
which is one hour ahead of GMT, but I don't know if EST has a summertime
adjustment of the same kind. How people in the Southern Hemisphere get their
heads round all this I hardly know, I remember being in Australia the other
year and if ever the question of time differences came up a slightly glazed
look would come over people's eyes. All I'm trying to suggest is that it
would be useful if the Buffalo statement could include a definition of the
Buffalo on the lake's edge day against GMT with a proviso about any
summertime (in the North) adjustments to that day so people know what
they're doing!


All the Best

but have not wise men said that there is more too life? Or maybe we only
think we have answers whereas in reality we only struggle with questions?
What kind of fool requires authority to speak his or her mind? What kind of
person demands it? How old can a poet ever be? How do you ever stop becoming
a poet, and simply be a man? How do you not question yourself in a world of
violence, is your leisure a violence unto itself? Why do people pretend to
be more than people, and act as though they are divine intelligences without
divinity? When did we stop listening to the spirits that move the wind and
put rain in the sky? When did we stop to smell roses? When does a true
warrior cry? When does a real revolution happen? When will the disease
called Babylon stop? When will language be nothing but poetry into the ear
of our days? When will scholasticism be replaced by knowledge? When will we
give our knowledge like a prescious gift to be shared by child and adult
alike? When will men bow to their wives? When will we all live our lives for
mother earth and cry like her rain drops? When will we be happy for tears
and our lives empty of fear? How does a person talk without a cage in the

attacks? When?

And then he wandered his days
screaming at pictures and faces
believing the thing before him was more about foreign places
then luxury that ate his bones
die 1000 times I hope I shall be killed
so cruelly so gently like a leaf tickling the sky
& some wonder why
they find a prison cell a release
and find strength in solitude to fight
every hour every day
even though their way is paved with a precise
decision of the power that be manifested in its war,
governments come and go
and so do monuments. Men
are often false in their internal pretense, but to believe
sometimes is the only good
to be found.

Hi all,

I've just rejoined the list after a several-year hiatus. Reading Kevin Killian's engaging
account of the Orono conference, and noting his mention of Bangor airport "swarming
with big Marines," I couldn't help but pass on this poem written at the airport bar, right
after Peter Middleton and several other conference attendees left for their flights. The
incident it describes is factual, though I notice Kevin found out the actual destination of
the Marines was Panama City, at least for the interim.

Three marines
watching
one laptop
In airport bar

On the way to Iraq,
I surmise.

See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.

Just then,
a somnambulant jarhead
puts trash from his tray
Into the bin behind me (my hand shielding this poem)

Then proceeds to walk through a plate glass window

His sword, His Bow and His Belt
(Like His Own Soul)
for Michael Desantes


Sometimes I wish I could stand underneath skies and pretend I'm holding
things up
high overhead-
like as if I were strong-

just like you-
I remember you-
your words lay like sparks on my breath

I could touch you then

I could touch your shadow as it scraped against the wall
and left my pant legs torn and my shoes ripped-
you'd say things but I'd never listen
something I regret now and then but-
I knew-
you see-
that-
It' d probably flatten me out
if I listened too carefully-

Instead, I'd picture you hitting a wall
a bar of light would pour out and bounce off the
floor
and run itself down your back
you always kept your back covered
the light would trace hand prints-
and other parts of you
I liked more-

Maybe, I’m just a dumbass pug, maybe;
maybe, a stupid punk.
With what I feel about shit and don’t get
Even when it’s right in front of me
Maybe creeping to the side
on my blind side
from the otherside
with my cut but...

I used to think-
I could sit you in a hot tub and watch you go to sleep;
you'd wake on my time;

I'd wrap a sheet around you and walk you to bed;
I'd touch your feet,
see your eyes close;
and feel the water drip from your head-
run itself down that zipper you got trying to beat a bullet in a sprint.
I could press the cuts on my body to it
with the imprint of my papa’s gun
tattooed to his palm
and with the .40 cals racing from his mouth:
You were brave enough
that’d I judge catching them
right in this hand.

I always liked you

When you walked-
I stood behind you
so the view was of you,
leaving
and the walk of your back-
you walked so well-
with the things we did-
in my thoughts;
if I could follow them-
I would trap each one in a cage
and package them for tourists
who can't make them for themselves-
can't bring this stuff across borders-

WE WERE DETAINED THE DAY BABAR AHMAD WAS DETAINED



Stop Police Terror Calls The British Public To Stop Being Bullied By
Bush & Blair



Action Alert

06 August 2004



In light of Thursday’s (5 August 2004) arrest of Babar Ahmad by
Anti-Terrorist officers acting upon an extradition request from the US,
incredulously alleging that he is responsible for planning attacks and
laundering money to terrorists, Stop Police Terror urges all British
people to stop being bullied by Bush and Blair and fight injustice by
attending the forthcoming conference in Tooting, South London this Sunday.



The high-profile case of Mr. Ahmad, formerly referred to as Suspect A,
who was arrested as part of the December raids, was the foundation and
inspiration for the Stop Police Terror campaign. Therefore it comes as
no surprise that the British establishment are seeking to remove this
thorn in their side only two days before the South London Stop Police
Terror conference was due to be held. Moreover, his arrest comes at a
time while investigations as part of the official complaint he lodged
are still pending in this case which had attracted much media attention
and aroused deep anger in the community. It is rather convenient that
the British establishment are now seeking to eliminate the very
individual who has exposed and widely publicised the extent of police
brutality and the arbitrariness of their arrests.



Mr. Ahmad is a law-abiding, upright British citizen, born and educated
in South London, Described as an “intelligent, articulate graduate with
a lovely family”, he is a well-known, highly beneficial member of the
community, who has contributed particularly to the preservation of the
Muslim youth and ensuring they are occupied with Islamic activities. Is
he really a dangerous terrorist, a key Al-Qaeda planner of operations as
they would have us believe, or simply a political pawn? Where is the
much-lauded British justice? Why must we bend at Bush’s every beck and call?



Was it not sufficient that the Anti-Terrorist officers burst into his
home and brutally beat Mr. Ahmad, inflicting more than 50- potentially
life-threatening- injuries in December 2003? Was it not sufficient to
imprison him in solitary confinement and interrogate him for 10 days,
subjecting him to psychological abuse, only to release him as a free man
without a single charge levelled against him. Surely if there had been a
shred of incriminating evidence it would have been found in the forensic
searches of his property, in the intricate scans of his computers or in
the raid of his workplace. And if that were not enough, then
exhaustively sending samples of his DNA and fingerprints around the
globe should have been more than adequate in securing some charge, but
unsurprisingly – yet again – they were able to find nothing. So from
where arises the need to extradite this British citizen to a country
infamous for its human rights abuses?



Can we really have faith in an administration which has arrested more
than a staggering 5,000 Muslims on its own soil since 2001, whose
soldiers continue to torture and humiliate innocent civilians from
Afghanistan to Iraq to Guantanamo? Can we rely upon an administration
which extracts confessions under torture and duress - or who renders
individuals to foreign governments to torture on their behalf - and
makes such confessions the basis for arrests and charges levelled
against individuals across the globe? Can we trust an administration
which deprives its detainees of legal counsel, of access to witnesses,
to independent enquiry for years, who evade the rulings of their own
Supreme Court? Can we trust such an administration to treat Mr. Ahmad
with fairness and justice, when its interests lie in raising and
lowering the terror alert at whim, to secure their seat in the upcoming
elections, who revel in creating an atmosphere of fear and paranoia
amongst the British and American people?



Let us not forget recent examples of the December and the Manchester
raids, where all detainees were released without charge, or the arrests
of Algerians in Scotland, whose lives were destroyed in spite of their
innocence now being established. Let us not forget the 594 arrests with
only 6 charged. Let us not forget the extradition proceedings against
Lofti Raissi which was thrown out in a British court for “lack of
evidence” and more recently, the charges levelled against Abu Hamza
extracted from a Guantanamo detainee interrogated under torture in legal
limbo, and as part of a plea bargain from a “man forced to buy his
liberty with his conscience”. We must not allow another miscarriage of
justice and must refuse this extradition. We demand that his case is
transparent and that if charges are brought against him, that he should
be entitled to a fair trial, with access to a lawyer on British soil.



Stop Police Terror urges all Muslims and non-Muslims alike to protest
this outright denial of justice and show their support for the campaign
by attending this Sunday’s Denial of Justice conference in Tooting,
South London. There will subsequently be NO ENTRY FEE required.







ACTION ALERT



1. The minimum but the most effective means of helping Babar Ahmad is to
supplicate for him - Make dua for Babar Ahmad in your tahajud (night)
prayers, while you are fasting and in the places and times where du’a is
most likely to be accepted. Take advantage of the fact it is Yawm
Al-Jumuah, make du’a between the adhan and the iqamah and in the hour
(the last hour before Maghrib on a Friday) in which supplications are
not rejected.



2. Advise all Muslims and non-Muslims you know to attend this conference



3. Publicise the conference in every way that you can - distribute
flyers, send out e-mails.



4. Raise awareness for this case by mentioning it in your Khutbahs
(Friday sermons), lectures, and by referring people to StopPoliceTerror.com



5. Write letters of complaint to Mr. Ahmad’s MP, Tom Cox, and to David
Blunkett. Further details and model campaign letters will be available
during the conference.



We must stand up in support of the victims of Police Terror before we
ourselves become the victims. Refusing to attend out of fear or paranoia
that we will become guilty by association is simply playing into the
hands of Bush and Blair. Our previous conferences have reiterated the
message of the story of the “Day The White Bull Was Eaten” - Do not fail
to act before one day it is said, “We were detained the day Babar Ahmad
was detained”.

thanks for corrections and shoemaker's input  i know enslin more thru a
few yrs of "real" letter writing  ( he uses an old fashioned non electric
job  thin paper short letters )  correspondence like good seafood and
living off the land is a way of life for him  ... his words ie poems
outweigh most in all senses  and what the f.......   difference would it
make if he were secretly wealthy or not   .... "ain't nobody's business"
( billie holiday ) anyway  shouldn't even be whispered about or put on
the list at all  hey should we stasrt naming the rich ones  dead and
alive and how they got their monies and how many are trustfund babies (
the title of my new chapbook out soon - shameless plug  unless my usual
bad run w/publishers continues)

anyway ted's a right guy who lives off the land so to speak and now in
his old age finds that a bit rough going  ..... but like i said earlier
on this list when folks played an intellectual game about the meaning of
biraka's name why'nt ask the man himself  if you ain't ashamed to think
it and bullshit about it behind their backs  ask em straight up....  had
a much more civilized way of presenting this but i forgot it all

1.
we'll be together
again was
one
here now in this wilderness
she seemed vaguely like someone i knew
once who laughed at hair clipped too close
i wished
it is after all a miserly thing
nothing to say i'll draw you a pic-
ture therein the wilderness
where rumors abound
rumors of wealth founded not
founded or what's it matter which a matter
wisdom of  det   word   file
she looked almost like someone i didn't know
hair longer now       ( fempriest )
old standards sung & forgotten
it's all his there in the wilderness 2 blind people
on their bellies crawling in the rain
hands searching for them-
selves

2.

it was very difficult to leave the sky behind today
i kept turning around to catch it
why am i the only person walking backward/
first time i ever saw a squashed squirrel
lower east side church spire mirroring itself
first time
i wonder why no one else is looking up
dead squirrel
n.y.c. roadkill
why is no one else walking backward
a voice that never talks to me inter-
rupts my ....."taking notes?"
- the sky -     useless chitchat........the sky

weaving thru the sensible garbage lining the curb
i bang my head on the coming grays

sunset in this town is for survivors
if i hold on long enough
i'll find out

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

a chameloen certainly
as pants are often painted camouflage
a hunter? maybe
maybe just the son of a gun
hired to his emotions
this one asks to cry with clouded skies
and sing with sunny days.

yes, I laugh with the thought at pretense
but sunny days are like sunny ray shots
tickling
the emotion of my feet and bad knee
walk around awhile.

Subject:      Report on Geof Huth event
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

David and others,

Apologies for being several days tardy with this,
it has been a busy week for me.

Geof's presentation was splendid.  I was able to
hang 9 visual pieces in clip frames prior to the
reading, so some of Geof's work was already on
the walls as Geof and family and then the
attendees of the reading arrived.  I rented an
LCD projector to enable Geof to project some of
his pieces on the bare 4th wall of the Gallery
and read from those.

Geof culled from various works to give the
audience a survey of the many incarnations and
nuances of visual poetry.  Where appropriate Geof
"read" from the works on the wall (notable pieces
include selections from "Dreams of the Fishwife"
and a piece, I believe, entitled "Stitch to
Stich" which invoked medeival marginalia.  This
reading/discussion of the visual pieces was
embellished by readings from some of Geof's
"textual" poetry, which provided an excellent
counterpoint to the visual works, and a good
sense of where Geof is "coming from" poetically
alongside the survey he gave of his visual sense.


Christopher Rizzo prepared a fantastic four-fold
broadside of Geof's pwoermd "symphony" forked
lake for the reading.  I believe Geof has the
majority of the remainder of these, though if you
contact Chris (you can do so by way of his
weblog, http://inplaceofchairs.typepad.com) he
may be able to send a broadside to anyone who is
interested.

The presentation was well attended, Geof's family
was there, faces I recognized were Chris Rizzo,
Jimmy Behrle, Ruth Lepson, Cheryl Clark, and
others whom I recognized but do not know by name,
and folks I had never seen before.  I think Geof
was pleased by the number of folks in attendance.
 I know that the folks who did attend had a rare
treat of seeing Geof present and read his work.
I was happy to have been able to make it happen,
and am excited about the prospect of doing
similar events in the future.

I'm sure Geof would be flattered by your
adumbration of John Wieners.  I like to think
that his ghost does look down upon all of these
little events we do in Boston, as he is our
patron saint, and to many (though I,
unfortunately, never me t the man) a departed
friend.

I encourage you all to save a place for visual
poetry in your various series/publications, etc.
The "page" is too often neglected in this climate
which oftentimes seems to value exclusivel the
"aural" in poetry.  Though obviously those among
this list do not have such a myopic view.

Geof gave me a generous box of his works which I
hope to write about at some point in the future,
as a kind of survey of his press and visual
poetry in general.

Geof has posted about the reading also on his
blog http://dbqp.blogspot.com, for a report from
the man himself.

Thanks for your interest!

-Mark

InterWriting

I think really, when it comes down to it, InterWriting is a negotiation
of respect between all participants & engaging the GrandGuiginolOfAwe.
Not a simple thing for Westerners raised on CornFlakes? and
competition. These choices of activity are learned painfully over time,
sometimes at the expense of friendships & comradery. The real challenge
for group writing in a wiki is to maintain a buzz of excitation, as if
witnessing the birth of a new TextOrganism? before one's very own eyes.
----

In a collaborative wiki environment reading becomes writing becomes
reading. It's hard to be passive when the EditText button is at the
bottom of every page. I have to admit tho that working in wikis with
people who are technical minded can be irritating as hell. Trying to
work in wikipedia for instance, where the hawks that watch over the
project have very little interest in FreeSpeech?.

I just received this lovely little, yet sweetly complex volume from David
Kennedy (British poet and bookmaker)  by he and his wife, Christine, writer
and, in this case, a photographer in cahoots with computer & printer . "A
Lean-To Edition" from The Cherry On The Top Press, it's an unnumbered,
handmade edition. The page format(s) - including see through circular punch
cuts, transparent acetate and opaque white and colored stock - and a double
entry to the text and visual images - betray any fuller description that I
might offer.

There is a kind of artist book I usually especially don't like - the
precious, Chinese designer box of internal cuts, typography, colors,
illustrations etc  - and zero content of any significance, except some kind
of bizarre homage to craft and skill.    This is not that.

The book - in all of its typographic, paper and visual intrigue - is a
structural analog to walks and an investigation of the geological footing,
terraces, stairways, and structures of buildings of the Medieval town of
Auzon in the Haut Allier area of Auvergne. The question and challenge for
the Kennedys and the book I suspect was how to confront the significance
within the constantly variant lure of an ancient ruin: "The spur/ in an open
casket of verdure", a stone stairway that rises aside a wall into nowhere,
geranium pots that block a porch, the presence of pumpkins, a Roman tower
looking steeply down, the implications of a serpentine lock on the entrance
door, deer's feet nailed to the gate, a minimalist echo from a voice of a
disappointed troubadour - on each page here mounted - through text & or
image - glimpse by glimpse .

The compression of this into a book object whose investigation both radiates
out and at the same time holds mystery in - I find rich and very impressive
- at the same, quite modestly done (tho obviously a hell of a lot of work).

I did not receive a sales prospectus with what is a gift. But I am sure
David Kennedy will be happy to provide the particulars. Email him at:

The CHRIS DRURY

The CHRIS DRURY is from Jermyn, Pennsylvania, where she went to SCRANTON
UNIVERSITY and moved to NYC where I taught at FILM VIDEO-ARTS and met her
as one of my students, who was born across the street from my parents'
house in KINGSTON, Pennsylvania. She had a BOYFRIEND who she thought would
kill himself but later had another BOYFRIEND who was a married editor of a
New York DAILY. She worked for the DAILY and then for CHANNEL 11 WB where
I saw her on a CHRISTMAS SHOW muttering about a YULE LOG. Her BROTHER
committed suicide on the JUNGLE GYM at his school. I never had a CRUSH on
The CHRIS DRURY, but had a small one on her friend. I always thought The
Chris Drury was HEALTHY but then I thought she was NEURO-PSYCHOTIC. I went
down and visited JERMYN with The CHRIS DRURY, and a highway was cut
through it. Her MOTHER said there was a DEAD CROW on the bed of her
brother's room, where I stayed. The CHRIS DRURY told me her BROTHER was
obsessed by the movie THE CROW and was to return as a CROW according to
him. Her mother's COMPUTER was a mess and I made it WORSE by trying to fix
it. Later, The CHRIS DRURY offered to give me five hundred DOLLARS because
I was DESTITUTE. Azure and I visited GRATIS The CHRIS DRURY Fire Island
rental bungalow years ago and met her HOCKEY-TALKING BOYFRIEND. I do not
remember if he was the SUICIDAL depressive one or not. It was THAT WEEK
which seemed to CEMENT our FRIENDSHIP to the extent she stayed at our
small LOFT when we went to Miami, finding when we returned many of our
BELONGINGS GONE INTO STORAGE, which was in BOTH OF OUR NAMES, but she had
a key and would not allow us in, and has since DISAPPEARED with OUR
BELONGINGS and the money she OWED US, as well as a HOLE in the WALL she
made for her CABLE TV, not to mention FILTH EVERYWHERE and LATE SUBLET
PAYMENTS which we had to cover the FINES FOR, not to mention still FINDING
years later some things HAVING DISAPPEARED and NO IDEA where they HAVE
GONE, including The CHRIS DRURY,

Cuneiform Press is pleased to announce the publication of :

        Dure=20
            by Craig Dworkin


CRAIG DWORKIN is the author of Signature-Effects (Ghos-ti), Reading the =
Illegible (Northwestern), and Smokes (/ubu). Two poetry books, Parse =
(Atelos) and Strand (Roof Books), are forthcoming in 2005, as are two =
edited collections: Architectures of Poetry (Rodopi) and Language to =
Cover a Page (MIT). He teaches at the University of Utah and edits =
Eclipse and The UbuWeb Anthology of Conceptual Writing.=20

Behold Dure! a book that wounds us and a wound that holds us as we hold =
it in our hands.  And yet who "we" are is not you and me, but I & I as =
readers.  To read Dure is to open one's eyes to the tears torn from =
them, as if by cutting the signatures of a text, like lifting the scales =
from your eyes, would make you see -- what "you" have done and what the =
"I" has done to the "you." Seeing is difficult, if not "hard" to endure, =
especially in a text incised with so many hard "C's" as if one were =
reading a surgery theory of grammar written by an Anglo-Saxon St. Jerome =
in his study, or Charles Sanders Parse.  In Dure, "Scarves carve curves" =
as a kind of "Scare tactics, semantics, skirt."  We are left with a =
sequence of lonely triplets that appear to have the lexical significance =
of a snare drum snapping out a flourish before the reader's execution -- =
"Cornea, carinha, cairn." The experience of reading Dure is like being =
able to see because you have had your cornea scratched -- as if seeing =
were marked by Morse code.=20

-Gregg Biglieri


"Where the yellow spot is and where I am pointing with my finger, that =
is where it hurts." These words, culled from a self portrait sent to a =
doctor, signal Dworkin's point of departure for a masterful meditation =
on the life and death of Albrecht Durer. Dure is the first publication =
in our new trade-edition series. The typeface is Dyrynk, designed in =
1929 by the Czech book artist Karel Dyrynk, & first issued in digital =
form by Richard Kegler of the P22 Type Foundry. Printed offset with full =
page spreads, black endpapers and bound perfectly. =20

Produced in an edition of 200, and available for the very reasonable =
cost of $10 per copy (include $3 S&H/US or $5.00/overseas). Review =
copies, invoices and standing-order are always available.
Order directly from the Press at:
      Cuneiform Press

Can anyone remember when and why the word "text" (as opposed to "book" or
"poem") first became fashionable in American academic discourse?

Garin Cycholl and I are trying to put together a collection of experimental
writing in response to Virgil's _The Georgics_ from writers in Milwaukee or
Chicago (or close by either), so if you feel Midwestern and want to write an
experimental farm piece that in someway connects to _The Georgics_ (we are
primarily looking to be suprised), go ahead an e-mail us before we e-mail
you.  Just think, how often do you get the chance to be in an experimental
book that relates to Virgil?  How neat is that?

Rob Halpern
Rumored Place
1-928650-20-1
113 pages / $14

Rumored Place is the first book by Rob Halpern of San Francisco.  In
it he combines a near confessional narrative of physical passion with
the documentation of "social fact."  He states, "As I imagine it, the
book is situated in a space between subjective desire and objective
need. In terms of form, this becomes a space between narrative and
the It is the tension, if not contradiction, between these two
approaches that the work sets out to activate."  Where is this
Rumored Place?  It exists in an impossible nowhere space and time.
"I've tried to activate the untimely tension between a present in
which it is impossible to live humanly, and a collective future that
exceeds our ability to grasp."  The writing takes aim at an
unrepresentable moment from whose standpoint alternate histories will
have emerged-and life will be other than we can imagine it now.

"Rob Halpern implodes new narrative tenets, collapsing all views of
our condition and the means to express these views into each sentence
at once: learned, aroused, mournful and full of hope. His book
conveys the intolerable crush of the ongoing, the grand brawl of
contending institutions and concepts hectically alive past their
deaths. Meanwhile the self continually gains and loses ID. The
intensity of what is said displays the extent of what can't be said.
This emptiness travels along with the story in the future perfect
tense, a negative space that has not been, an arcadia that cannot
have been lost, beyond knowing but not beyond needing. It is also an
orifice in the mind or body where the unspeakable of history might
enter and speak." --Robert Gl=FCck


Deborah Meadows
Itinerant Men
1-928650-21-X
96 pages / $13

"For hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee!" Ahab cries to the
whale, in Herman Melville's 1851 novel of the sea and social
relations.  Thinking of the 19th century as a jumble of
contradictions-free social experiment and slavery, revolution and
charisma, rational enquiry and racist construction,-Deborah Meadows
has written a book that takes Moby-Dick one chapter at a time and
provokes a reading-through of the novel that combines chance
operation with philosophical investigation.

=46ather Mapple recasts Jonah as a contemporary problem of sovereignty:
"=8A And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this
disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists."
Now under weigh, can Itinerant Men recast self and world by rejecting
bogus authority?  Is "self" a reliable stick or stone at the
barricades?  Is the writer a kind of negated self and thus possibly
immune from divine disappointment?  Or, in line with Rabelais, can
excess counteract the pull of compelling language that inspires one
to ends greater than the dollar?  Is value a scale under erasure?
Language a cobbled beast?


Kim Rosenfield
TR=C0MA
1-928650-22-8
64 pages / $13

Kim Rosenfield's Tr=E0ma is her first book since the award winning Good
Morning-Midnight- of 2001.  Tr=E0ma is both a festive book and a
frightening one, for Rosnefield has the quiet tones of Geppetto's
Workshop, the mummery of harlequinade, and the terror of the giant
swallowing fish.  Tr=E0ma, she says, "embodies a child's tale but
redesigns it to pit the mistranslated circus of personal ambition
against public episodes of wronged military might.  Tr=E0ma is slippery
too: it is upended and equipped with reflectors, so that the reader
seems to be looking straight ahead, but is really peering down and in
to a shadow-box picture of an Italian hill town.  Tr=E0ma should be
thought of as being carried by two itinerant showmen, in a big flat
box."

"Kim Rosenfield narrates the trajectory of 'an unluxurious piece of
wood' in a unique language whose inflections have an exhilarating
effect. Her Tr=E0ma is a dance of the elements charged with a keen
sense of the absurd."

-Rodrigo Rey Rosa



Rodrigo Toscano
To Leveling Swerve
1-928650-23-6
80 pages
$13

Ideological intention meets ideological surprise in To Leveling
Swerve, Rodrigo Toscano's fourth book of poetry.  While continuing to
develop his overriding concern with poem as radical social interface,
To Leveling Swerve extends the notion of poetic diction not as an
exclusive problematic of aesthetics nor of any one (social or
political) culture as interpretative key, but as a volatile
commingling of the two.  In this book, monumentalist high-modernist
motivations are unveiled as discrete rhetorical moments in history.
Those moments, in turn, approximate a delicate (coarse) national
literature on the verge of becoming a stout (smooth) internationalist
poetic.

"In times that are too serious for solemnity, the question What's new
in poetry? has been echoing through the realms of innovative writing
as usefully as a car alarm.  Rodrigo Toscano seems to have heard this
call as clearly as anyone has of late.  Sincere and sarcastic
historian, he contorts his poetic inheritance from the pre-Socratics
to recent innovators, using rhythmic outreach, frontal and sly, to
produce a danceable inventory of the present's equivocations and
aliases.  To Leveling Swerve is exciting, funny, encouraging, and
perspicacious without any hint of premature congratulation.  What
Toscano does here will remain useful: it hasn't been done before and
needs to be done more."

Thanks Lucas. I figured it might have been Barthes, but more specifically I
was asking when and why, that is, what did it allow people in the field of
English at the time to do that they couldn't do before? What was it about
the context or the situation that made this idea catch on, and as an
alternative to what?

Hi Tim,

My guess is that "Text" allowed theorists, critics, scholars and
other English Dept. types the liberty to consider a much broader
scope of material, not just the standard canonical poems,
novels, plays etc.  Since anything that's "read" can be a text,
text-ual scholars (and the Eng. Depts. that house them) could
work on projects that wouldn't normally "belong" to that field.
It also opened up more opportunities for inter- and
cross-disciplinary work.

Tim:

I'm sure some others on the list might be more exact about the lit theory
being discussed here, but let me see if I can get the bare-bones of it.

New Criticism was the main method of reading literature through the fifties,
and it offered a version of non-authorial based criticism. Their arguments
against authorial interpretation, in articles like "The Intentional
Fallacy", propose that for fine literature, for literature worth examining,
the work of literature is the full embodiment of the author's intent. Any
further digging in the biography of the author takes away from involvement
with the literature itself.

In the post-structuralist seventies, when French critics were influencing
anglophone literary scholarship with their more "scientific" and linguistic
examinations, the mood shifted and the argument against investigation of the
author's life involved suspicions that any one person could ever control
language, or define it. Same point as the New Critics (keep literature
central), but opposite means. American scholars seem to have taken to
Barthes's distinction between works and texts (this is where I get a bit
hazy), which is related to "readerly" and "writerly" texts; in "readerly"
texts, the reader is passive and follows along, wheras in "writerly" texts
(like many masterworks of modernism and postmodernism) the reader is
compelled to take an active role in "writing" the meaning. I don't think I
ever read the essays or articles where Barthes specifically defines "work"
and "text", but I think it has to do with the importance of the writer to a
full understanding (as far as that's possible) to the literature in
question.

I may be mistaken on some of the details, but the overall trajectory is
basically history.

What's interesting is how creative writing classes interact with all this.
If scholars have become more and more dry in the past thirty years, and
authors and poets have become less and less involved in criticism, it may
have a lot to do with this very distinction between "work" and "text".

Perhaps it's the American Protestant Work Ethic. If French culture, where
the protestant work-ethic is decidedly not what is pervasive in the US, left
us its scientific credoes for scholarship, creative writing has turned more
and more towards process, revision, and work (while turning away from
inspiration and other concepts impossible to teach). Someone described MFA
writing programs as Switzerland: isolated cantons whose inhabitants talk
endlessly of craft, and where nothing more magnificent than a cuckoo clock
is ever produced. But if scholars are always talking about text, denying the
"work" and the human element of fiction and poetry, and Creative Writing
classes are always talking about work, unable to avoid the human element,
it's no surprise that English depts. end up being pretty schismatic.

I for one have gone through an education that offered both creative writing
and literary criticism classes, and while I have reservations about each
system, I'm not as critical as either as many are. In addition,
post-structuralism is not the king theory of literature departments anymore
(Derrida, De Man, Barthes were great, but left few descendants who could go
beyond their initial conquests), and in the post-colonialism, post-feminism,
and so on that has since ascended is inevitably going to pay more attention
to the author's life and history in creation of the text. And yet, it's
still called text, rather than work. Probably because scholars still believe
that more goes into the text than the author consciously works to put in
there. I wonder what anyone else thinks.

as for the difference between "text" and "book or poem", I don't know.
"text" probably offers more potential for breadth and general statements.

Lucas

DONALD JUSTICE


Writer won Pulitzer Prize for his poetry

BY KATHLEEN FORDYCE

kfordyce@herald.com


Poet and Pulitzer Prize winner Donald Justice, a Miami native and author of
more than 10 books, died Friday from pneumonia at a nursing home in Iowa. He
was 78.

Justice not only wrote poetry, he traveled the country teaching his art at
colleges and universities, including the University of Miami.

''He taught for many years and taught many well-known writers,'' said his
wife, Jean Ross Justice. ``He was a very energetic and brilliant person.''

He won many awards for his work.

In addition to the Pulitzer Prize for Selected Poems in 1980, Justice won
the Lamont Award in 1959, the Bollingen prize in 1991 and most recently the
Lannen Literary Award in 1996, his family and friends said.

''His poetry was so marvelous,'' said Dee Clark, Justice's longtime friend
and a Miami painter. ``One of the greatest qualities for me was the honesty
of it.''

His friends say that no matter how many poems he wrote or books he
published, he never changed.

''He was so loyal to his friends,'' Clark said. ``He became so well known,
but he always kept in touch with us.''

Justice has published more than 10 books, including New and Selected Poems
,A Donald Justice Reader: Selected Poetry and Prose and Orpheus Hesitated
Beside the Black River: New and Selected Poems 1952-1997 .

This month, his latest book, Collected Poems , will be released.

Born and raised in Miami, Justice graduated from Miami High and the
University of Miami.

In 1946, he moved to North Carolina and earned his master's degree at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

That same year, he met Jean Ross, a short story writer also working on her
master's. The couple married a year later and had one son, Nathaniel.

After they married, the couple moved back to Florida and Justice taught for
several years at UM. During his tenure, he took a year off and studied at
Stanford.

The Justices then moved to Iowa, where he earned his doctorate from the
University of Iowa in 1954.

The couple lived in Iowa for a few years, but Justice still traveled quite a
bit, teaching at different universities, including Syracuse University, the
University of California, Iowa, Princeton and the University of Florida.

In the 1980s, they returned to Florida and Justice taught at UF for 10
years. The family then moved back to Iowa when Justice retired from
teaching.

Justice is survived by his wife, son and many friends.

Services have not yet been scheduled.

Urging anti-corporate activists to internalize a human resource
manager in their heads is sort of like urging feminists to get in
touch with their inner penile patriarchalist, isn't it?

BULL

=93I thought you said that bull was shy,=94
My uncle said as he and I
Stopped walking out in mid-July
        And leaned on his neighbor=92s fence.
=93He was,=94 the neighbor said.  =93Ain=92t now;
Not so=92s you=92d notice, anyhow.=94
And its appetite for a brindle cow
        Seemed, like the bull, immense.

My uncle asked him,=93What=92d you do?=94
The neighbor paused a decade or two,
Then, =93Wrote to Agricultural U,=94
        We watched the bull perform.
At last, my uncle:  =93What=92d they say?=94
=93Asked for a sample.=94  I thought the way
These two were going it=92d take all day
        To agree July was warm.

=93They sent some serum.  I gave him a shot.=94
He finally said.  =93You see what I got.=94
We watched the scene the serum wrought
        Like bovine sex were new.
The bull seemed willing to give his all,
To young or old, to short or tall,
Their udders big, mid-size, or small,
        An indiscriminate view.

I fidgeted, thought I'd be dead
Of boredom before my uncle said
=93What was in it?=94 and shook his head
        And gave my arm a shake
Because while hot and under-awed
I=92d found an anthill to maraud
And restlessly had kicked a clod
        Just to see it break.

He answered before the thought of sweat
And how it splashed on dust could get
Its grip on me, to my regret.
        =93Well, I don=92t rightly know.=94
We watched the scene the serum caused
Through air the heat had lightly gauzed,
And waited. And waited.  He spat, and paused,
        Then, "Tasted like licorice, though.=94

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and taverns!),
utilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented forms. We
will explore the structural possibilities of language to ultimately answer
the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning and practiced
poets will generate lots of original writing from this full day of language
play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye with which to
revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson Literary
Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the Arts, Mad
Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled notspeak.

please forgive the overlap. I've been away].

***********************
Hello everyone!

I have two very gratifying announcements to make: at long last I've published
COMBO 13 as well as our first COMBO BOOK, K. Silem Mohammad's  A THOUSAND
DEVILS.

COMBO 13 features poems by

Amy King, David Hadbawnik, Rodney Koeneke, Catherine Meng, Ray DiPalma, Thom
Donovan, Kyle Schlesinger, Katie Degentesh, Chris Canavale, Brandon Downing,
Kristen Gallagher, Stephanie Young and Rodrigo Toscano

as well as Phil Metres's interview with Jerome and Diane Rothenberg

and a selection from our second COMBO BOOK (forthcoming in the Fall)
ALSO WITH MY THROAT I SHALL SWALLOW TEN THOUSAND SWORDS: ARAKI YASUSADA'S
LETTERS IN ENGLISH, ed. Kent Johnson and Javier Alvarez.

COMBO is 60 pages, saddle-stiched w/ glossy cardstock cover w/ original
artwork.

4-issue subscriptions to COMBO are $12.00

A Lifetime subscription (which includes all available back issues) is $50.00

And our new "Full Lifetime Subscription" -- $100.00 -- entitles you to all past
and future issues of the magazine and all past and future Combo Books.  This is
a phenomenal deal!

As for our first book, it's a doozy!

K. Silem Mohammad's A THOUSAND DEVILS is a beautiful trade paperback of 104
pages with a kick ass cover featuring swarming ants and many many fantastic
poems.  The purchase price is $12.00.  Here are the words of two wonderful
poets on Mohammad's book:

*******************
Imagine Olivier portraying Yosemite Sam as a Bedouin, "May a thousand devils
take 'em!", which I'm told is a curse as PG Obsolete as Pantagruel yelling
"Sacre Bleu!"  However, be warned as each of Mr Mohammad's poems provides a
new form of hotfoot for the info-damned at the nostalgia-plex; read for
example "The New South."  Hear within devils pass through a participle
accelerator as the sound of nouns bleeds away the din to reveal Pandemonium.

--Michael Gizzi

If an ancient had an epileptic seizure, he was possessed by a
thousand devils.  When he regained consciousness, the devils were
driven out by a healer. The devils had to go somewhere. In this case
they have gone into the poems. Upon reading this book, my brain
seemed to be scorched with a hissing flame of fire. a million nerves
were open and screaming in agony, curling hooks into my flesh. I went
to bed but could not sleep. The words were like flying birds, the
lines like humming bees. Pandemonium! The poems roar or whisper
balefully from the sand or from the wind, or stir unseen in the
coiling silence; or fall from the heavens like  crushing incubi. They
yawn like a sudden pit before the eye of the reader. I see in the
poems the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep
eyes, fiery black and bold, there seem tokens of a spirit that would
dare a thousand devils (and the hairy creature clinging to his
throat) to scream with infernal delight at the sound and sight of
these verses' awful agony and hopeless despair. With their dismal
fooleries they transform our worthless days and disentangle a
thousand evils, and they are indeed, incredible.

--Nada Gordon

Aldon,

You are saying, then, that professors of religion and
ministers you knew tended to refer to ANY book or poem
as a "text"? If so, this is quite intriguing, but I
guess a very natural extension of utterances like
"this sermon is a based on a text from Isiah".

I remember being stuck by Robert Creeley in class in
the 70s saying firmly "OK let's return to the
text"--senses of the word "text" from church services
of his youth were presumably mingling with new
post-/post- usages he was reading about.

As Aldon suggests, the religious usage is quite old,
and, of course, the use of "text" as "book" at least
dates in English back to Chaucer. Here's a definition
and quotation from the OED regarding the religious
use:

*The very words and sentences of Holy Scripture;
hence, the Scriptures themselves; also, any single
book of the Scriptures. Obs.

13.. E.E. Allit. P. C. 37 For in e tyxte, ere yse two
[Poverty and Patience] arn in teme layde. 1393 LANGL.
P. Pl. C. III. 129 Ich theologie e tixt knowe. c1420 ?
LYDG. Assembly of Gods 1500 Fast by Doctryne, on that
oon syde, As I remembre, sate Holy Texte. 1542-3 Act
34 & 35 Hen. VIII, c. 1 §10 It shalbe lawfull to
everye noble man..to reade..any texte of the Byble..so
the same be doone quietlie. 1597 SHAKES. 2 Hen. IV,
IV. ii. 7 To heare with reuerence Your exposition on
the holy Text. a1668 DAVENANT Poems (1672) 329 Since
Holy Text bids Faith to comprehend.

But here are some other usages that are very close, if
not identical, to our current usage (pertaining to
texts as books or poems, rather than, of course, other
kinds of non-print "texts"--body as text, culture as
text. I wonder if those "texts" are texts more
metaphorically, i.e., we can "read" them as if they
were texts in the old sense.) I especially like
Chaucer's use of "text and glose":

That portion of the contents of a manuscript or
printed book, or of a page, which constitutes the
original matter, as distinct from the notes or other
critical appendages. In first quot. fig.

c1369 CHAUCER Dethe Blaunche 333 And alle the wallys

1597 MORLEY Introd. Mus. Annot., I haue..thought it
best to set downe in Annotations, such thinges as in

WARTON Hist. Eng. Poetry (1840) II. xxiii. 304 note,
It is not immediately formed from the Troye-boke of
Lydgate, as I have suggested in the text. 1848 MILL
Pol. Econ. I. v. §8 (1876) 48 note, Consequently, as
shewn in the text, her labourers suffered. 1859
TENNYSON Vivien 669 Every marge enclosing in the midst
A square of text that looks a little blot.

*Applied vaguely to an original or authority whose
words are quoted. Obs.

recordis, at e mode kynge..farne out of toune. c1400
Destr. Troy 4007 But truly I telle as e text sais.

*The wording adopted by an editor as (in his opinion)
most nearly representing the author's original work; a
book or edition containing this; also, with
qualification, any form in which a writing exists or
is current, as a good, bad, corrupt, critical,
received text.

1841 MYERS Cath. Th. III. §8. 26 Our present Received
Text has been a growthimproved from many and various
sources. 1845 GRAVES Rom. Law in Encycl. Metrop. II.
770/1 Hänel, the latest editor, has not inserted these
seven constitutions in his text. 1870 FREEMAN Norm.
Conq. (1877) II. App. 658 The text seems very corrupt.
1875 SCRIVENER Lect. Text N. Test. 7 The vast
importance of preserving a pure text of the sacred
writers. 1891 Athenæum 15 Aug. 219/1 No attempt has
been made to settle the text.

The OED provides other shades of meaning as well.

Best,
Joseph

Rob Halpern
Rumored Place
1-928650-20-1
113 pages / $14

Rumored Place is the first book by Rob Halpern of San Francisco=2E  In
it he combines a near confessional narrative of physical passion with
the documentation of "social fact=2E"  He states, "As I imagine it, the
book is situated in a space between subjective desire and objective
need=2E In terms of form, this becomes a space between narrative and
the It is the tension, if not contradiction, between these two
approaches that the work sets out to activate=2E"  Where is this
Rumored Place?  It exists in an impossible nowhere space and time=2E
"I've tried to activate the untimely tension between a present in
which it is impossible to live humanly, and a collective future that
exceeds our ability to grasp=2E"  The writing takes aim at an
unrepresentable moment from whose standpoint alternate histories will
have emerged-and life will be other than we can imagine it now=2E

"Rob Halpern implodes new narrative tenets, collapsing all views of
our condition and the means to express these views into each sentence
at once: learned, aroused, mournful and full of hope=2E His book
conveys the intolerable crush of the ongoing, the grand brawl of
contending institutions and concepts hectically alive past their
deaths=2E Meanwhile the self continually gains and loses ID=2E The
intensity of what is said displays the extent of what can't be said=2E
This emptiness travels along with the story in the future perfect
tense, a negative space that has not been, an arcadia that cannot
have been lost, beyond knowing but not beyond needing=2E It is also an
orifice in the mind or body where the unspeakable of history might
enter and speak=2E" --Robert Gl=FCck


Deborah Meadows
Itinerant Men
1-928650-21-X
96 pages / $13

"For hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee!" Ahab cries to the
whale, in Herman Melville's 1851 novel of the sea and social
relations=2E  Thinking of the 19th century as a jumble of
contradictions-free social experiment and slavery, revolution and
charisma, rational enquiry and racist construction,-Deborah Meadows
has written a book that takes Moby-Dick one chapter at a time and
provokes a reading-through of the novel that combines chance
operation with philosophical investigation=2E

Father Mapple recasts Jonah as a contemporary problem of sovereignty:
"=8A And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this
disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists=2E"
Now under weigh, can Itinerant Men recast self and world by rejecting
bogus authority?  Is "self" a reliable stick or stone at the
barricades?  Is the writer a kind of negated self and thus possibly
immune from divine disappointment?  Or, in line with Rabelais, can
excess counteract the pull of compelling language that inspires one
to ends greater than the dollar?  Is value a scale under erasure?
Language a cobbled beast?


Kim Rosenfield
TR=C0MA
1-928650-22-8
64 pages / $13

Kim Rosenfield's Tr=E0ma is her first book since the award winning Good
Morning-Midnight- of 2001=2E  Tr=E0ma is both a festive book and a
frightening one, for Rosnefield has the quiet tones of Geppetto's
Workshop, the mummery of harlequinade, and the terror of the giant
swallowing fish=2E  Tr=E0ma, she says, "embodies a child's tale but
redesigns it to pit the mistranslated circus of personal ambition
against public episodes of wronged military might=2E  Tr=E0ma is slippery
too: it is upended and equipped with reflectors, so that the reader
seems to be looking straight ahead, but is really peering down and in
to a shadow-box picture of an Italian hill town=2E  Tr=E0ma should be
thought of as being carried by two itinerant showmen, in a big flat
box=2E"

Ideological intention meets ideological surprise in To Leveling
Swerve, Rodrigo Toscano's fourth book of poetry=2E  While continuing to
develop his overriding concern with poem as radical social interface,
To Leveling Swerve extends the notion of poetic diction not as an
exclusive problematic of aesthetics nor of any one (social or
political) culture as interpretative key, but as a volatile
commingling of the two=2E  In this book, monumentalist high-modernist
motivations are unveiled as discrete rhetorical moments in history=2E
Those moments, in turn, approximate a delicate (coarse) national
literature on the verge of becoming a stout (smooth) internationalist
poetic=2E

"In times that are too serious for solemnity, the question What's new
in poetry? has been echoing through the realms of innovative writing
as usefully as a car alarm=2E  Rodrigo Toscano seems to have heard this
call as clearly as anyone has of late=2E  Sincere and sarcastic
historian, he contorts his poetic inheritance from the pre-Socratics
to recent innovators, using rhythmic outreach, frontal and sly, to
produce a danceable inventory of the present's equivocations and
aliases=2E  To Leveling Swerve is exciting, funny, encouraging, and
perspicacious without any hint of premature congratulation=2E  What
Toscano does here will remain useful: it hasn't been done before and
needs to be done more=2E"

CONCRETE EXAMPLE: (from a real educational-type situation, one among many)

Q: But what about the social context out of which the film arose and the
writer who wrote it? What about the history of similar genres it learns
from? Aren't these important things to look at if we want to know about its
meaning?

A: I suppose one might look at these things, but on the other hand, these
films are TEXTS, so they are "out there floating around" and we "can do
whatever we want with them".

Somewhere back there in Grenier "I hate speech" time (197_)- or whatever he
said to dispossess "voice" based poetry, the word "text" became authorized
as primary to language making (throwing person/voice centered poems into the
dustbin of l'histoire). The French folks obviously providing a supporting
"text centered" role here. Inevitably, like most extreme exclusionary acts,
this one, too, would crumble, but not without having some obviously healthy
impacts on shaking up the 'lit' landscape.

But "text" also became central operating word in the new hegemony of the
computer. Engineers who perhaps never read a spec of much in the way of
poetry or other literature were constantly speaking of and feeding in
"lines of text" for x, y or z program.    In the context of the pixilated
screen - those little loom-like squares - I always assumed the word "text"
was used in its original Greek sense as into "weave" - as one keyboarded in
one letter after another: the screen displaying a "text", or, in the Greek
translation, a weaving.

It is ironic that "text books"  - especially in the heyday of "Great Books"
- were always considered second class in relationship to "primary sources."
As if textbooks were a diminishment or dilution or only a fractional
representation of the "real" or authentic text.

In vernacular (secular) English, I suspect - the fundamentalists and
academic usage notwithstanding - "text" always seems privileged or off to
the side of "real life." Tho, ironically, it's "text" in the law, insurance
forms, etc., etc. that is most likely to do one in - we are constantly
reminded - if you don't pay attention "to the small print."

I suspect the swing back and forth between the centrality of voice and that
of text is as old in this country as Cotton Mather translating English
Sermons back into Latin while he listened to them in Church. Or the
confusion thereof:
George Bush disguises himself as vernacular folk while actually seeing
himself as a channel for the Almighty's Biblical text.

The word "text" became popular with American academics in the late 60's
(deconstruction) because it contributed to a revisionary history of
romanticism which preferred allegorical or ironic language over the
'unity' of romantic symbol ("il n' y a pas de hors-texte").

I think partially Saussure "Cours de Linguistique g=E9n=E9rale" (1916) =
and
later Derrida's "De La Grammatologie" (1967)

ooh kevin just getting to read these now, after over a month of

entirety of the new bio of gayorga, and it paints a somewhat more
ambiguous picture of kantorowicz's legacy thru s-george.  a
fascinating book Secret Germany, by Robert Norton.  i wrote abt ek a
bit in this forthcoming essay that's going to be in that book After

>Until recently however I was never sure how much, exactly, Spicer

>Gless's brother on the show, and just last Saturday Vic got killed
>off on the show, so picture their shock when they were walking
>through Neville Hall and bumped right into Vic face to face.  "We
>were as close to him as I am to you!" they swore, and even though I
>didn't know who he was, I still wanted to get his autograph, it's the
>way I'm made.  "We asked him what he was doing at Orono and he said
>he was going to be Robert Lowell!"
>
>The big Saturday night event this year was to be a performance of a
>play which had been made out of the Lowell-Bishop letters, a
>two-person play.  I couldn't make up my mind if this sounded like a
>good idea or a very, very camp idea.  I liked the name of the
>playwright-Monique Fowler-who was also going to be playing Bishop
>opposite the Robert Lowell of "Vic"-but the play had a title that
>seemed determined to explain everything away before you even saw it.
>"One Atlantic: From Bangor to Rio."  It barely made sense, and yet it
>made too much sense.  As for "Vic," he is a Canadian actor who was
>one of the late Timothy Findlay's favorites and who also recently
>played Shakespeare in a new play called Swansong so perhaps Robert
>Lowell wasn't much of a stretch.  Apparently Robert Lowell wrote that
>insane poem, "Skunk Hour," just a few miles from where we sat gabbing
>and eating, and apparently Elizabeth Bishop lived thousands of miles
>away enjoying the permanent Carnaval society of Rio. although maybe
>"enjoying" is the wrong word; still, one gets the idea that she's
>have a few drinks at sunset and then write to Lowell about her
>problems with that stern architect whom she loved so much.
>
>Thus the conversation turned to the way high culture occasionally
>leaks into mass culture.  Jennifer Moxley recalled the Fred and
>Ginger film, Top Hat (1935), in which a telegram comes and Ginger's
>dress designer reads it to her.  "Come ahead-stop-stop being a
>sap-stop-you can even bring Alberto-stop-my husband is stopping at
>your hotel-stop-when do you start-stop."  The dress designer frowns.
>"I cannot understand who wrote this!" he cries.  Ginger snaps,
>"Sounds like Gertrude Stein."  Anne Tardos recalled a Chabrol film in
>which a detective presses a madeleine on a recalcitrant suspect,
>saying "They're great for the memory."  I always thought that
>Hitchcock's The 39 Steps was referencing Proust; if you recall, the
>plot revolves around the search for the UK music-hall performer, "Mr.
>Memory," who snaps into motion, spouting huge realms of data, when
>confronted by the visage of the leading lady, Madeleine Carroll.
>Coincidence?  I think not.
>
>In the middle of the dinner Doug Rothschild turned up, having driven
>all the way from Albany New York with Don Byrd.  Doug was staying at
>Steve and Jennifer's house also, in the cutest room up in an old
>fashioned attic, the kind of room you picture Fairfield Porter having

>have never gotten to see alone I don't think, and finally I realized
>what people were saying was right, all these years, he is a prince of
>a fellow.  He switched back and forth between these two beautiful
>suits, one bright red like a cardinal, the other more of a
>mulligatawny, he was the most elegant man in Maine outside of J.
>Hillis Miller.
>
>I had my one book that I got people to sign, it was an Advance

Avatar (TM) an epic poem

the life and death of DC's Superman

Geoffrey Gatza=20

www.blazevox.org/books/gg.htm =20

=20



Geoffrey Gatza's epic poem, Avatar(TM) the life and death of DC's =
Superman, set in 70 cantos, relating to the years of Superman's life and =
death in print, 1938 through 1993, details the 20th century american =
poetic style and motive. This is a post-9/11 reading of america and it's =
un-erring depiction of what is right and just. Pick up your copy today! =
{ What's the matter? Have you nothing to say about America? Do you not =
dare be grandiose? This work is grandiose if nothing else. Here, Gatza =
masterfully concocts an intelligent and lucid epic poem as his =
contribution to the American avant garde in a time when epics tend to be =
pass=E9. Avatar(TM) marries the gusto of a comic book with a collection =
of fascinating esoterica culled from 100 years of western history. =
Gatza's poetry is unassuming and engaged, this work marks him out as a =
poet to keep an eye on. [Aloysius Werner; Contemporary American Poetry ] =

Baghdad Burning

... I'll meet you 'round the bend my friend, where hearts can heal and soul=
s
can mend...

Saturday, August 07, 2004
=A0
Clashes and Churches...
300+ dead in a matter of days in Najaf and Al Sadir City. Of course, they
are all being called =8Cinsurgents=B9. The woman on tv wrapped in the abaya,
lying sprawled in the middle of the street must have been one of them too.
Several explosions rocked Baghdad today- some government employees were tol=
d
not to go to work tomorrow.
So is this a part of the reconstruction effort promised to the Shi=B9a in the
south of the country? Najaf is considered the holiest city in Iraq. It is
visited by Shi=B9a from all over the world, and yet, during the last two days=
,
it has seen a rain of bombs and shells from none other than the =8Csaviors=B9 o=
f
the oppressed Shi=B9a- the Americans. So is this the =8CSunni Triangle=B9 too?
It=B9s d=E9j=E0 vu- corpses in the streets, people mourning their dead and dying
and buildings up in flames. The images flash by on the television screen an=
d
it=B9s Falluja all over again. Twenty years from now who will be blamed for
the mass graves being dug today?
We=B9re waiting again for some sort of condemnation. I, personally, never had
faith in the American selected proxy government currently pretending to be
in power- but for some reason, I keep thinking that any day now- any moment=
-
one of the Puppets, Allawi for example, will make an appearance on
television and condemn all the killing. One of them will get in front of a
camera and announce his resignation or at the very least, his utter disgust=
,
at the bombing, the burning and the killing of hundreds of Iraqis and call
for an end to it=8A it=B9s a foolish hope, I know.
So where is the interim constitution when you need it? The sanctity of
private residences is still being violated... people are still being
unlawfully arrested... cities are being bombed. Then again, there really is
nothing in the constitution that says the American millitary *can't*
actually bomb and burn.
Sistani has conveniently been flown to London. His =8Cillness=B9 couldn=B9t come
at a better moment if Powell et al. had personally selected it. While
everyone has been waiting for him to denounce the bombing and killing of
fellow-Shi=B9a in Najaf and elsewhere, he has come down with some bug or othe=
r
and had to be shipped off to London for check-ups. That way, he can remain
silent about the situation. Shi=B9a everywhere are disappointed at this
silence. They are waiting for some sort of a fatwa or denouncement- it will
not come while Sistani is being coddled by English nurses.
One of the news channels showed him hobbling off of a private airplane,
surrounded by his usual flock of groupies and supporters. I couldn=B9t quite
tell, but I could have sworn Bahr Ul Iloom was with him. E. said that one o=
f
the groupies was actually Chalabi but it was difficult to tell because the
cameraman was, apparently, standing quite far away.
The thought that Sistani is seriously ill does make everyone somewhat
uneasy. Should he decide to die on us now, it will probably mean a power
struggle between the Shi'a clerics in the south. Juan Cole has a lot more
about it.
Last week churches were bombed- everyone heard about that. We were all
horrified with it. For decades- no centuries- churches and mosques have
stood side by side in Iraq. We celebrate Christmas and Easter with our
Christian friends and they celebrate our Eids with us. We never categorized
eachother as "Christian" and "Muslim"... It never really mattered. We were
neighbors and friends and we respected eachother's religious customs and
holidays. We have many differing beliefs- some of them fundamental- but it
never mattered.
It makes me miserable to think that Christians no longer feel safe. I know
we're all feeling insecure right now, but there was always that sense of
security between differing religions. Many Iraqis have been inside churches
to attend weddings, baptisms, and funerals. Christians have been suffering
since the end of the war. Some of them are being driven out of their homes
in the south and even in some areas in Baghdad and the north. Others are
being pressured to dress a certain way or not attend church, etc. So many o=
f
them are thinking of leaving abroad and it's such a huge loss. We have
famous Christain surgeons, professors, artists, and musicians. It has alway=
s
been an Iraqi quality in the region- we're famous for the fact that we all
get along so well.
I'm convinced the people who set up these explosions are people who are
trying to give Islam the worst possible image. It has nothing to do with
Islam- just as this war and occupation has nothing to do with Christianity
and Jesus- no matter how much Bush tries to pretend it does. That's a part
of the problem- many people feel this war and the current situation is a
crusade of sorts. 'Islam' is the new communism. It's the new Cold War to
frighten Americans into arming themselves to the teeth and attacking other
nations in 'self-defense'. It's the best way to set up 'Terror Alerts' and
frighten people into discrimination against Arabs, in general, and Muslims
specifically... just as this war is helping to breed anger and hate towards
westerners in general, and Americans specifically. A person who lost their
parent, child or home to this war and occupation will take it very
personally and will probably want revenge- it won't matter if they are
Muslim or Christian.
I always love passing by the churches. It gives me a momentary sense that
everything must be right in the world to see them standing lovely and brigh=
t
under the Baghdad sun, not far from the local mosque. Their elegant
simplicity is such a contrast with the intricate designs of our mosques.
There's a lovely church in our area. It stands tall, solid and gray. It is
very functional and simple- a rectangular structure with a pointy roof,
topped by a plain cross or 'saleeb', simple wooden doors and a small garden=
-
it looks exactly like the drawings your 7-year-old nephew or daughter would
make of the local church. This simplicity contrasted wonderfully with its
stained-glass windows. The windows are at least 30 different colors. I
always find myself staring at them as we pass, wondering about the myriad o=
f
shapes and colors they throw down upon the people inside. It hurts to pass
it by these days because I know so many of the people who once visited it
are gone- they've left to Syria, Jordan, Canada... with broken hearts and
bitterness.

 "In this environment, we need new natural gas supplies more
than ever,'' wrote El Paso's federal government affairs director to Robert W.
Middleton, the director of the White House Task Force on Energy Project
Streamlining. "We believe that the Valle Vidal Unit could be a vital new
source of such supply. Consequently, we would very much appreciate
anything you could do to help move this process forward in a timely
manner.''

This is terrible. That's beautiful country. You can walk from Las Vegas, NM,
through the Pecos Wilderness, which joins the Carson National Forest, all
the way to Taos without crossing a road. Maybe a five-day trip.

Retro Seventies Forties Night Out

                                I

I know a box with nothing in; I call't - my friend.
The danger of pentameters is that they can go even further.
There is a too far, I know, it ends in a box.
Last night I loved you, my tongue told your mouth.

                               II

Two middle-aged people, the one (the him)
a bankrupt alcoholic, the other (the her)
a gold-toothed crackhead. Holding each other
for a little winter love in a dark corner.

                             III
Quatrains bore me. But they can hold in
your lips on the chopsticks as I dipped
the beef satay into you, the broody
scent of sex in sudden summer's air, before ....

                             IV
Before perpetual night. Summer,
and winter stands stage door. Love,
and death holds by with the keys.
This verse is too abstract, there must be

                            V
flesh and blood behind it. A real
Seventies chick I called her, as her long
loose hair curled like a stream's flow.
I kissed her nipples like pollen. We hugged

                           VI
as if afraid of death.

'fucking mental cripple'

i'm a fucking mental cripple, to use a coined phrase, sitting in front of
this machine hour after hour, as if the whole world's in it, when I know
damned well it's addictive. i used to think it wasn't, just something i
could walk away from, a corner for my art, now i've got constant headaches
and can't stop taking pills for them, i'm on just about everybody's kill
files, a literary spam nuisance to the rest of the world, not even a hyper
link to save my faltering web pages given me by the grace of some fucking
charitable god. i keep putting ill-earned dollars into this equipment
which needs far too much updating for an unemployed permanent non-worker
who fucks up at every chance of getting nothing done whatsoever. or should
i go for disability given my complete failure at work, mucking up here and
there whenever i can. it's a wonder i have a partner or any friends at
all, the screen's already shimmering at the edges as my eyes can't focus
and i'm getting closer to a migraine by the minute. should i take the
codeine again, because if i don't the headache will spread just like it
does daily and furious in the frontal lobes or somewhere around there, my
eyes feeling as if a hammer had hit them, and all this when i'm awake,
which isn't too often, as a result of depression or maybe unnaturally low
blood pressure, according to my doctor, who tells me to take coffee. as if
i didn't take coffee day in and day out, when i'm not eating fruit and
other sugary things. but nothing does any good, when i'm stammering in
front of the monitor, absorbing cancerous radiation almost every minute
of the bloody day with nothing to show for it but a text like this or a
goddamned pretty picture or video that lasts less time than a commercial
with a lot less sense. i should get up and die but i have to log off first
and that takes time, maybe set the whole thing to hibernate.

hibernate. hibernate. hibernate.  i'm i'm a a i'm i'm a fucking mental
mental fucking a fucking mental cripple, to cripple, mental mental
cripple, use a use to cripple, to a coined coined use to use coined
sitting sitting coined a a phrase, front front in coined coined sitting of

Hi everybody, I'm following the recent discussion on 'TEXT', and my ears =
pick up with interest. Having a few genre identity problems here, this =
side of the world that seem solved by calling my work text based instead =
of poetry...or fiction...this is coming from a rather conservative =
writing  program in a conservative country. If the writing is rich the =
writing of long pieces are tentively but anxiously assumed fiction; the =
short is labelled poetry. Since my work is influenced by the language =
poets and the west coast experimental narratives...french philosophy and =
theory, i rest with calling my work text based instead of settling =
somewhere in the mid west. I'd be very interested how other people =
handle this delema or if they have it at, all ever. Australia is =
conservative interms of innovative writing but hopefully  will be open =
to change in the future, but for now the genre rules like a big =
stick...J

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from Brad Brace.
The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact;
an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present of the
Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest on
December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years` worth
of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour posting
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

Nice idea about the screens - except that the original interfaces were
punch-cards and print-outs were, for a long time, the only means by which
you studied a program. Most screen-based editors were of the single-line
variety like ed and even if you used something like  TPU on  VAXen or vi on
UNIXen, the screens (mostly VT100s or even VT320a) were too small to
actually see much on.

From the online meriam-websters:

5 a : the words of something (as a poem) set to music b : matter chiefly in
the form of words that is treated as data for processing by computerized
equipment <a text-editing typewriter>
6 : a type suitable for printing running text

So, although I can't come up with any conclusive proof that the original
greybeards used it in the sense that you do,neither can I conclusively (if
you can use such a phrase in etymology) find evidence that supports your
assertion, although it certainly is pretty.  I think that the term "text"
was in usage in the computer industry long before the mid-eighties. The
term "text editor" was in usage far before I started work in the industry.

Somewhere back there in Grenier "I hate speech" time (197_)- or whatever he
said to dispossess "voice" based poetry, the word "text" became authorized
as primary to language making (throwing person/voice centered poems into
the
dustbin of l'histoire). The French folks obviously providing a supporting
"text centered" role here. Inevitably, like most extreme exclusionary acts,
this one, too, would crumble, but not without having some obviously healthy
impacts on shaking up the 'lit' landscape.

But "text" also became central operating word in the new hegemony of the
computer. Engineers who perhaps never read a spec of much in the way of
poetry or other literature were constantly speaking of and feeding in
"lines of text" for x, y or z program.    In the context of the pixilated
screen - those little loom-like squares - I always assumed the word "text"
was used in its original Greek sense as into "weave" - as one keyboarded in
one letter after another: the screen displaying a "text", or, in the Greek
translation, a weaving.

It is ironic that "text books"  - especially in the heyday of "Great Books"
- were always considered second class in relationship to "primary sources."
As if textbooks were a diminishment or dilution or only a fractional
representation of the "real" or authentic text.

In vernacular (secular) English, I suspect - the fundamentalists and
academic usage notwithstanding - "text" always seems privileged or off to
the side of "real life." Tho, ironically, it's "text" in the law, insurance
forms, etc., etc. that is most likely to do one in - we are constantly
reminded - if you don't pay attention "to the small print."

I suspect the swing back and forth between the centrality of voice and that
of text is as old in this country as Cotton Mather translating English
Sermons back into Latin while he listened to them in Church. Or the
confusion thereof:
George Bush disguises himself as vernacular folk while actually seeing
himself as a channel for the Almighty's Biblical text.

REMEMBER ANTHANY JAMES DAWSON 11 Aug
WEdnESday


http://victoria.indymedia.org/news/2004/08/28834.php

Letter from Nancy Dawson H. Benjamin Casson Q.C (AB)

Concerning James Anthany Dawson: We conclude that: 1. Racism is a factor
in my sons' death; 2. There is an attempt at a cover-up; 3. The
Coroner's Inquest did not allow for public exposure to the circumstances
preceding Anthany's death and did not provide an unrestricted
opportunity for interested parties to elicit any evidence of misconduct
on the part of members of the Victoria Police Department. 4. Considered
as a whole, the evidence of witnesses as to their observations of events
involving member of the Victoria Police Department and Anthany Dawson,...

Letter from Nancy Dawson to:
 H. Benjamin Casson Q.C (AB)
 Acting Police Complaint Commissioner

 Mr. Casson:
 Re: File: OPCC 0681
 Request for Public Hearing Re: Death of Anthany Dawson

 I have received a copy of your letter dated August 28, 2002 addressed
to my
 lawyer, Adrian Brooks. I must say that I am very disappointed. I did have
 high hopes that perhaps the old boys club would have been set aside and
that
 each case would be reviewed in detail. I ask you to review my sons' file
 again and to allow us to have a public hearing. The following are a few of
 the reasons:

 In your letter to Mr. Brooks, you state that there will be no public
hearing
 for my sons' death. You state that "In reviewing the files, I concentrated
 on two information sources i.e., the Investigation Report by the Victoria
 Major Crime Unit of the R.C.M.P. and the transcripts of proceedings before
 the Regional Coroner. "

 In reviewing these two files you must have come across the fact that the
 R.C.M.P. officer that was conducting the investigation was denied the
right
 to interview the Victoria City police officers involved in the death of my
 son.

 You went on to say: "In the transcripts, I focused on the testimony of
 witnesses who observed events involving members of the Victoria City
 Department and Anthany Dawson which occurred on August 11, 1999."

 You will then recall that one of the witnesses had stated that Anthany was
 punched so hard by one of the police officers that it sickened her. You
 will also recall that eight witnesses, with no motive to lie, give their
 version and a police officer with a motive to lie denying the witnesses
 statements. How can we have faith in a process that will attempt to sweep
 the witnesses statements under the rug and cling to the police statements?
 Where is the equality?

 You then went on to state: "In reaching my conclusions in this matter, I
 posed, for myself, four questions:

 1. Is there any information or evidence to suggest that a member or
members
 of the Victoria Police Department exhibited, or were motivated by, racist
 attitudes toward Anthany Dawson?

 We contend that there is and as we were assured at the Inquest, all of our
 questions and concerns in that matter would be raised in a public hearing.
 We were told that a public hearing was the proper arena in which to shed
 more light on this subject as the inquest was not the proper arena in
which
 to discuss this.

 2. Is there any information or evidence to suggest that the Victoria
Police
 Department or the investigators who prepared the Investigation Report
by the
 Victoria Major Crimes Section, through their investigations into this
 matter, attempted to cover-up events in order to avoid placing blame on
 members of the Victoria Police Department?

 We contend that there is such evidence. To name only a few areas, I bring
 your attention to the "Critical Incident Report" that should have been
filed
 upon the death of my son by the police officers involved. Not only was
this
 not done, but the police lawyers made absolutely no reference to this
report
 at all and left it up to the public (through our lawyer) to come across
this
 report. Even when this report was named at the inquest, the police lawyers
 attempted to downplay its importance by stating that it is under review,
 making no reference to the fact, that while it may be under review, that
 such a report was to have been filed. Why was this information not offered?

 Another point is that of the handcuffs: Each and every police officer
 stated that they could not clearly state whose handcuffs were placed on
 Anthany as they were all the same. Yet the public, (through our lawyer)
had
 to wade through more cover-up maze to discover that indeed, all police
 handcuffs have serial numbers on them in order to identify whose handcuffs
 were used. Why was this information not offered?

 Why did the police make no attempt to locate witnesses despite being
 informed of my sons' death?

 The R.C.M.P. Special Investigation Unit issued a report finding no fault
 with the Victoria City Police Officers involved in the death of my son.
 This report was plastered all throughout the media, but never once did
that
 Investigator offer the information that he was denied the right to
interview
 the police officers in question. How can you do an Independent Thorough
 Investigation, if you cannot interview the people involved?

 3. Did the Coroners' Inquest provide a reasonable and unrestricted
 opportunity for the Regional Coroner, the Coroner's Jury, Counsel for the
 Regional Coroner and interested parties (through Counsel) to adduce and
test
 evidence particularly as it related to events involving members of the
 Victoria Police Department and Anthany Dawson?

 We vehemently contend that it did not. Many, many, questions that our
 lawyer raised in trying to determine what happened to my son were met with
 responses either by the Coroner stating that the Inquest was not the
proper
 arena to ask those questions; or by the police lawyers advising the
Coroner
 that our lawyers' questions would be better answered at a Public Hearing.
 The Inquest raised more questions and did not answer any of the
questions we
 originally had.

 4. If the Coroner's Inquest did provide that opportunity, did the evidence
 as to the conduct of members of the Victoria Police Department, taken as a
 whole, indicate misconduct to justify ordering a public hearing?

 The Coroner's Inquest did not provide a level opportunity to have our
 questions answered, rather, it uncovered even more questions of a cover up
 and racist actions.

 We conclude that:

 1. Racism is a factor in my sons' death;
 2. There is an attempt at a cover-up;
 3. The Coroner's Inquest did not allow for public exposure to the
 circumstances preceding Anthany's death and did not provide an
unrestricted
 opportunity for interested parties to elicit any evidence of misconduct on
 the part of members of the Victoria Police Department.
 4. Considered as a whole, the evidence of witnesses as to their
observations
 of events involving member of the Victoria Police Department and Anthany
 Dawson, along with the Victoria Police Department's attempt to cover up
the
 Critical Incident Report; and the handcuffs, to name only a few does
indeed
 justify the need for a public hearing.

 You are in a tough position sir, you must keep your colleagues in mind,
and
 you must weigh the reports that you are given. We are asking for a public
 hearing into the death of Anthany Dawson on August 11, 1999 in Victoria,
 B.C. This is a subject that no police department wants to address, but if
 we don't we will only ensure that this type of mistreatment will carry on.

 The entire theory of these procedures is to have a completely open
process,
 but we are far from that. I ask again that you review the entire case and
 that you call for a public hearing. As Sergeant Batershill has taken it
 upon himself to issue unsolicited public statements about welcoming the
 civil suit, I have no choice but to copy this letter to the media.

 Yours truly,

 Nancy Dawson
 Anthany Dawson's Mother

I post this, as well as, the "Zionism and the Twenty-Five Rules of
Disinformation" article because we have seen a trend and harsh attack --
via the net and physical assaults of various special interests groups
out to pull a COINTELPRO bombardment of the peoples with ignorance, as
well as arms ment to kill -- in the end they are so self absorbed in
hate and greed that these stumbling people see not the ignorance they
display to the world and how completely unattractive they appear to the
presesnt generation; that they see the solution to the situation not via
Freedome Justice Equality B.U.T. in tyranny and might makes right
tactics of fear to maintain their power and desires over an opressed
people.  It is a sad situation to live in a time inwhich we see this
sociopathic behavior at large and well armed, B.U.T. it is a reality
inwhich we must struggle (jihad -- theTRu meaning of jihad-- which is
struggle and not war) for TRU freedome.

...and an outer struggle begins with an inner struggle

As our peoples are being assaulted and bullied physically with bombs and
shelling and radiations poisoning, as well as, rapes and disease, we are
being attacked by the pen and the net and in public with harsh words
cruelity and dumb founding callousness. ...and it makes us afraid cuz we
live among these people -- it' like discovering that you have walked
into nieghbourhood of serial killers and vampires who consider such
conduct as normal and civilized.  All our morality has been turned
round. Killing the poor is good and so is greed as is mass murder.
...and belief in kindness courtesy and compassion is considered foolish.
TO be loyal and ethical is something for fools, so we are told. ...and
all our passion can be wiped away with a "hit and run" quip and cyber
smirk and lowbrow joke to make the bored romans seated in the arena
giggle -- we are told today that this is courage.  ...B.U.T. what about
the thousands dead in Iraq? what about the murder of our native bredden
(which our so called 'activist' and 'anarchist' remain impotent in their
"activISM' to address)? what about the killing of the poor in British
Columbia by the jakes? what about the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians
in the ever growing middle-east and the whitemail and harassement by
north amerikkkan zionist that we should say nothing about it? what about
the gentrification of our hoods? what about using the poor as babymaking
machines? what about the left so called activists, who act just like the
aryan nation, only they hide behind privialge, white feminism, the
gaygousie, consume tofu and claim a safe cause celeb to attack all the
samo niggers that the powers have always attacked? What all the
supremacy of the great white north who when confronted or criticized are
the first to holla "racism"? as they call a kkkop gang to kill the
niggers and the natives and poor? ...again - what about Anthany James
Dawson (11 Aug 99)? Gerald Kaboni, Frank Paul? Jeff Berg and the
countless others and the daily deaths of our shahada/our martrys? in
this the ethnic, cultural and economic cleansing in the western puscht
for power and property.

...diaries in New Palestine

I really didn't think that my community within Victoria, BC was very
important, to the world, except to me B.U.T. I am seeing that we have
become the focus of these assaults like those IMC and dissidents in
larger more well known cities.  I fear that I might fail my community of
New Palestine/The Hood/Fernwood -- for I am not a particularly strong
man nor am I perfect, not am I all that brave -- however, I do try and
believe in things (which I see one tactic of the enemy is to humilate
those beliefs and destroy the believers) and I do feel the words of
Khadijah McCall, Malik el Shabazz,  Imam Ali, Rose Henry, Gil Scott
Heron (who I learn more from than all the suits who claim civility) and
because of bruh  Solomon Cobbs and abdul-Rahman, I have come to again
appreciate the WISE DOME of Hon Min Elijah Muhammed -- who has been
greatly left unappreciated due to the over shadowing of his articulate
followers -- some of whom being Malik to Farrakhan to Khalif Muhammad
and gladly so forth -- so it is important as is taught by wise men of
many beliefs and of ISlam that we must fight with the tools appropriate
to the battle -- for we should sink to the low levels of the
snakes/bullies/tyrannts we wish to combat we would have failed.  We are
been taught mercy, compassion, kindness and not go up against peoples
who are unready/unfit for combat or to use WMD (Weapons of Mass
Destruction or DIStraction) against children and against men and women
with rocks and baseball bats or what likkle arms they can scrape
together to keep the Culture and maintain Freedome Justice Equality.
When we fight it is not to conquer B.U.T. to regain the meaning lost in
translation to an "openning".

We must all do are part in every sector, block and every ghetto, and
every hood and city and country to keep Freedome Justice Equality -- to
"Be a friend to the oppressed and an enemy to the oppressor"

is
It is import, my peoples (nas), that we are aware of the tactics used to
destroy us, turn each against each one and/or offer us DIS in the
formation of fake Knowledge.

These are scarey times and our enemies are very few B.U.T. very well
armed with physical weapons and our enemies are free with threats
because they are cowards well armed and ready to take out as many of us
possible until they runout of arms and scrilla.  Then only the TRU and
the Brave will be steady in our our inner and outer struggle against the
injustice.

peace to Anthany James Dawson and all the loved ones who have fallen and
who still believe in Freedome Justice Equality

"Forty-four years ago, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad said to me,
"Brother Farrakhan, you cannot fathom the depth of Satan." Those of us
who can't think like that would never believe that a human being was
capable of planning the deaths of innocent people to further a political
and an economic objective. ...Now, they are saying that President George
W. Bush is the greatest friend that Israel has had of any president in
this country. Well, if George W. Bush is their greatest friend, then how
can he be an honest broker in a search for peace?"
--Hon Mins Farrakhan

Imam Amir al-mu'minin (A.S) said: People are enemies of what they do not
know


"Revolution is bloody,revolution is hostile,revolution knows no
compromise,revolution overturns and destroys everything that gets in its
way. And you, sitting around here like a knot on the wall, saying:'I 'm
going to love these folks no matter how much they hate me.'No,you need a
revolution." --Malik Shabaaz;Message to the Grass Roots

"If you avoid breaking laws and do what you're told and ignore the poor,
the oppressed and the downtrodden - you probably won't be bothered. If
you try to right what is wrong, however, you will surely meet great
opposition and run the risk of imprisonment or death."

Spam Attacks: Editor Speaks out

it was best to combine those from the two threads about the attacks on
VanIndy.

You're right, it's ridiculous

content - in some cases massive photo compilations, in other cases
foolish cartoons, in others lengthy articles, in order to try to
interfere with this site, and to try to get their message across.

Please take my advise and use words, instead of these childish tactics,
to try to convince others of your position. Your disruptive behaviour
earns you nothing but enmity from the users of this site, and damages
your cause. It does not help. Spell out your position clearly in words
and try to respect others. That goes for people on both sides of all
contentious debates. I know that emotions run high on these issues, and
that these are life and death issues. But we must behave in a civilised
way if we are going to work towards better understanding and cooperation
in this world.

Thanks.

Answer to gehrig's question
by editor . Friday March 19, 2004 at 12:22 PM

I, who am but one of over a dozen editors here, have edited over 50,000
articles and 200,000 comments on this site over the past three years. I
know very well exactly who is posting what and why. The patterns,
methods, perspectives and incentives are very transparent to me. Yes,
99% of the problems of the kind described above are Zionists who are
very upset by the content of some of the comments and articles posted on
this site by its users. This content is admissible according to this
site's editorial policy, but not admissible by the standards of these
few ultra excitable and conservative Zionists.

There are no neo-nazis in the Vancouver Indymedia editorial collective,
I assure you. We all believe in freedom of speech, and full compliance
with Canada's hate speech legislation. This, in conjunction with the
mission of this site, accounts for our editorial policy, and should not
be interpreted to imply any bias in our personal political philosophy
being interjected into the site. No one that I have met at Indymedia or
any of dozens of other civil society groups in Vancouver harbors any ill
will towards either Jews, Israelis, Zionists, Palestinians, or Muslims.

Both Zionists and anti-Zionists, warmongers and peace activists are
welcome to express sincere, reasoned perspectives on this site.

Advocacy of or incitement to racial, national or religious
discrimination, hatred and violence or persecution, however, is where we
draw the line.

Zionist information terrorists spamming this site again
by editor . Saturday March 20, 2004 at 12:58 AM


Would the Zionist fanatic who keeps posting the silly "Punk Alien"
garbage on our site please cease and desist. If this keeps up we may be
forced to ban the participation of all Zionists from this site, since a
few of them seem to be incapable of behaving in a civilised fashion.
Thank you.

If some of the resident Zionists would kindly contact your command post,
we here at Vancouver Indymedia would be most obliged. If you can't
control your operatives, we will not be able to continue tolerating your
participation in discussions on this site. I suggest that your cult
programming should be expanded to include basic manners, civility and
respect for modern conventions of civilised behavior, like tolerance of
different viewpoints, restrain from calls for genocidal extermination of
non-Jews, and freedom of speech.

Three types of malicious info terrorists
by editor . Saturday March 20, 2004 at 01:38 AM

In three years volunteer editing this site, I have observed the following.

99% of the time, everyone behaves reasonably well.

However, every once in a while one of three groups acts up and tries to
sabotage or destroy the effectiveness of the site.

1) Sneering, arrogant, cynical, sarcastic, contemptuous neoconservative
warmongering fanatics who worship multinational corporations, Milton
Friedman economics, and the permanent war economy.

2) Dopy, devoted, Christian fundamentalists who think that George W Bush
is the return of Christ.

3) Ultra conservative Zionist fanatics.

Not once, to my memory, has even one neo-Nazi, Muslim, Palestinian,
Arab, environmentalist, peace activist, unitarian, Iraqi, native
American Indian, street youth, squeegy person, or drug addict ever
abused the open publishing system to maliciously try to destroy this
site and disparage the community it serves.

I know this particular spammer
by editor . Saturday March 20, 2004 at 02:21 AM

I have personally hidden several thousand of his spams from this site
over the past six months, which has consumed a considerable amount of my
valuable time. I know his psychology very well. He is an angry,
fanatical Zionist zealot who is trying to punish this site for hosting
articles critical of his "homeland" and object of idolatrous worship

Yes, the techies are working on this side of the soluton
by editor . Saturday March 20, 2004 at 02:52 AM

Thank you for your suggestions. They are very good. We have been
discussing such things for a long time, but had hoped that the need
would not occur. But the situation has gradually deteriorated to the
point where the kind of measures you suggested are definitely necessitated.

Regarding the identification of the seeming group affiliation and motive
of the spammer, the reason that I am sharing this information is so that
we are not naive or assigning blame to the wrong source, and that we are
all aware of not only the technical dimension of the problem, but the
sociological dimension as well.

After all, it is worthy of note that it is essentially only one person
who is seemingly driving a major technological remedy (or set of
remedies) which could significantly impact the user friendliness of this
site.

I believe that it is highly instructive to be aware of the precise
source of the problems that this site, and those like it, are facing.

Some Zionists, in my experience, and only Zionists, are incredibly
arrogantly and self-righteously predisposed to demand that the content
of all media be forced to conform to their very peculiar standards and
interpretations, and are seemingly willing to pursue virtually any
means, sometimes even including violent acts towards people and
property, to enforce their authoritarian dictates where they have
absolutely no legitimacy to do so.

These fanatical Zionists who relegate to themselves the role of "thought
police" are also very litigous, as well as being technically astute.
These kinds of tendencies, when combined with extremist ideological
fanatism, produce extremely dangerous behaviour which I believe that all
people have a right to be made aware of in order to protect themselves
from the threats which they pose to freedom of speech, belief and
artistic expression.

the hammering on girders
creaking of the crane
music
wind & ocean     music
helicopter        music

"my god"

clouds & sun pacing back & forth
in the sky

because they are harsh to us
we turn against our allies

because they are harsh to us
we kill their sons & daughters

because they are harsh to us
we loot their national treasures

because they are harsh to us
we silence all their voices

because they are harsh to us
we set up puppet governments

because they are harsh to us
we make them a "democracy"

because they are harsh to us
we fill them up with fast foods

because they are harsh to us
we steal their natural resources

because they are harsh to us
we incorporate their hearts & souls

because they are harsh to us
we turn them into factories

the clouds dominate the sky today
the waves crash violently
upon this usually calm shore
my shoulders & chest convulse w/shivers
my teeth chatter
my bloodless fingers go stiff & numb
as my cheeks become warm & red

the gulls are beginning to circle
only a few children & old men are brave enough
to swim at this hr
the hammering has stopped
the girders silenced
the crane still creaking in the wind
helicopters still on patrol
the music's turned nasty like the weather
as the water reaches my feet
i feel a heat within the undercurrent
like a comforter
a message from hell

because they are harsh to us.......
because they are harsh to us.......

the sailboat beyond the rocks seems so relaxed
the white of its sail so still
you'd never know there was a wind
3 children run from the ocean
the oldest ( a girl ) waving something
chanting
"i found a dollar  ---  i found a dollar"
& she had
in the water  among the waves   the waves
the waves.....the last place you expect to find
   C-A-P-I-T-A-L-I-S-M
                                           the waves .....

because they are harsh to us
we destroy them then defend them
we befriend them then destroy them

then

we fold up our blankets & go home

because they are harsh to us
we are harsh to them

because we are harsh to them
they are harsh to us

I wanted to stay away from criticising anyone's
politics during my first months or even my first year
on this list, but how can you post something where it
says that "harsh words" from opponents  are
reprehensible and yet which refers to antagonists as
"serial killers" "vampires" "snakes" "bullies"
"tyrannts" (sic).  Don't insult people's intelligence.

And if as what you've posted says "jihad" to the
community you represent is "struggle and not war" what
is this Malik Shabbaz quote you always use as one of
your tags about "revolution ïs bloody, revolution is
hostile".  Now surely one can find honorable aspects
in the history of "bloody" revoltion, but don't you
think some of us know who Malik Shabbaz is, the man
who said for instance": (now the source where I found
this just now is an ADL site, but I hope you won't
quibble about that, because this was widely reported
in newspapers in 1994):

As a warm-up speaker for Khalid Abdul Muhammad at
Howard University (February 1994):

Shabazz: Who is it that caught and killed Nat Turner?
Audience: Jews!
Shabazz: Who is that controls the Federal Reserve?
Audience: Jews! (faintly)
Shabazz: What? You're not scared, are you?
Audience: Jews! Jews!
Shabazz: Who is it that controls the media and
Hollywood?
Audience: Jews! Jews!
Shabazz: Who is it that has our entertainers…and our
athletes in a vise grip?
Audience: Jews!

oops I meant a good text or a good CD or some good words... I guess I have
been reading too much Derrida. I recomend Liquid Swords by GZA Genius to any
wanna be scholar who thinks they know Hip Hop... sometimes lyrics are about
things you don't understand, so don't pretend too. Sometimes people just
speak, and the truth of Liquid Swords is very profound. Peace,
     A good line that would help explain the entire album is "The life of a
drug dealer." I would assume that Wu_Tang clan had to run the streets to
finance their albums, and people like that never forget where they are from.
The hood? Don't guess, ask.

Yes... but the spiritual justification for the Palestinians fight against
Isreal is "jihad" as in the struggle for life. The politics of Islam are
more complicated than any westerner could understand. The jihad of the
Palestinians is probably not connected to Al-Queda... in other words, it
doesn't have to be. The problem is the united states and its ignorance...
jihad is a universal term that refers to the spirit of Islam. That is
probably why everyone and their brother or sister did not condone 911 no
matter what the reasons because it was against the spirit of Islam, even
though it is carrying its name. However, EVERYONE recognizes the injustices
done to the Palestinians. Well, sorry, except for some rich Jews in NY. As
for Ishaq, does anyone remember the label "Domestic Terrorist" that was
created by the Patriot Act? If a person is labeled as a domestic terrorist
then their entire life is fair game, and one can be labeled as a domestic
terrorist for speaking... I suggest you re read the Patriot Act, this time
with your eyes open real wide. Homeland Security is already in place and is
working non stop against all threats to the United States Government, and I
would assume that also includes revolutionaries. It's funny how a caucasion
revolutionary walked through every neighborhood in Albany and was NEVER
robbed, attacked, or even threatened by people. This time CointelPro is
deep.
     I am a Roman Catholic who has been studying Islam via Thomas Merton,
who took spiritual practices from Sufism and felt that Islam was the exact
same Christianity and that the only difference is the treatment of Jesus
Christ (the Koran reconizes Jesus). Politics are always connected with
spiritual practices (guess what? there never was a seperation between church
and state... only on paper) & those who recognize the truth and speak it
will always face hardships. I would not consider Ishaq's email
unreasonable... the Jews do have a strong base in key states (ie New York
and probably Florida) and major Universities (ie SUNY Albany). Think twice
though, because the leader of the Free Palestine movement in Albany is a
practicing Jew, Naomi Jaffi... Weather Underground what what!

I sort of put everything together, respected the order till a point
and then let things go as they wished, have a look:

Euridice - Dubuffet

Didn't we play with light feathered arrows
after our erosive labor
earth-breath pounding
earth-bread in our earth-mouths
with mud in an enpebbled concrete text
reflecting shadows' fever-pulses
beating

beat again in a furtive concert
come back, my air flower
behind the forbidden curtain
as when through the mental staircase
I could see you, the leopardy patina
or brutal d=E9cor could not camouflage you
ricocheted as an echo in the gaps
of the text of the missing

and we bathed down with the shadows
Euridice devastated in waters, we rocked
her decrepit role
and let her out, nude air she was
geo-embodied in the light
brief sight within her new life cycle
and hid our secret up-standings
into wrinkled elements.

All in a-tremble, among vivid stone-laces, earthly embroidered, caught
in vestiges and conjugated to scorcheries
in a futuristic violet dynamism following a secret calendar
she touched the cloudy text in silver-flat readings
foaming bed of appeasement for her nights
by the underground theater of our imagining
a festival of celestial earth for her:

Euridice, earthed again onto the surface=20

Hi All,

Kristin Prevallet send me this posting about her blog. I wanted to pass it
on.

Brenda Coultas


Subj:   Letters from Citizen Kay


I've started a blog, it's called "Letters from Citizen Kay." I am going
to attempt to write as many letters as I can per week pertaining to the
issues of the day, as I see them.

Here's the description:

I've been writing a lot of letters to the government lately. But, since
the government is busy, I keep on getting form letters (or no letters)
in return. So, I decided to set up this blog to chronicle my letters
and, hopefully, use it as an incentive to write even more letters. I'm
just trying to stay informed, and to voice my opinions to the
powers-that-be, rather than to just my friends, who are all on my side
anyway.

I hope to hear from some of you.

Maria,

I was thinking of Malik Shabazz of the New Black
Panther Party, who enunciated the text I quoted in
1994.  Yes, Ishaq's quote is from Malcolm X, I have
just discovered--from a speech in November 1963
critizing the non-violent Civil Rights movement.  So
that part of my post is really wack, with perhaps a
partial excuse that Malcolm X called himself Al-Hajj
Malik El-Shabazz, so  seeing the shortened Malik
Shabazz didn't connect to him.  But I apologise to
you, Ishaq and all to have spread confusion and
trouble in that portion of my remarks.

Evocation of entire realm of the subcutaneous.
Dark paint running down rivulets

Add to that Ishaq's ever-amusing insistence that Zionists are spammers, and
you quickly realize that his posts are easily discarded, with no fear of
accidentally missing something important. Problem solved.

"have you ever read music or listened to a book"
More at 7:30 by lawrence y braithwaite


*****

    Mr. Dadiers office was grey. Maybe a little pastel beige. It had a
few paintings on the walls. They were of the non-threatening pasteral
nature. The paintings were sceneries selected to calm the visiters. They
never said anything about the man. What Mr Dadier’s likes or dislikes
were of no consequence. It was all very threatening in a non-threatening
manner. A social worker must be non-threating but accertive when issues
arise. When decisions are made.
    Actually, Mr Dadier was a councillor but had had experience as a
social worker until he applied for this position as a school councillor.
Dadier had upgraded his eductaion with a few social studieds classes --
first at Camosun College and then later he recieved his degree at the
University of Victoria.
    Montgomery’s mother had taken a trip to India earlier in the Fall.
She does like to travel. However, she really isn’t offered the
opertunity too often. She lives with her boyfriend and Montgermy in a
house along Denman street.
     His mother said that his father lives on a hobby farm over on the
mainland. Montgomery never met his father. He has a drinkin problem.
Montgomery’s mother said that she was introduced to him at a party. He
had gotten into trouble with the law soon after and had to spend
sometime in prison. But his friends had made sure that she was never
alone while his father went through the trial. However, with their
misguided intentions, they made her feel almost responsible for the
troubles Montgomery’s father was going through.
    His father does send her letters once in awhile. Not his father nor
his friends want her to forget them. They had become so attached.
    Montgomery pulled the note out and looked at it. It was from
Charlie, it read “Dear bruh...”
    Montgomery took time out to correct some of the grammar.

    “You show me a perfect person and I still might try. The
    only perfect thing is Gawd Jesus  The Lord and nobody even
    conversates talks wiph with Him no anymore.”

    Mr Dadier pulled Montgomery’s file [#19359].  It read, “Charles
Montgomery Xavier Fuller”. Mr Dadier looked at the file with the same
attentiveness  a retired English school teacher would as they corrected
the grammar in the Times Colonist.
    -So how are you feeling Montgomery-
    -Ok-
    -How’s your mother? She making out-
    -Ok-
    -I love India, myself-
    -Yeah? She’s back-
    -Yes, that’s good. How’s your son doing-
    -He alright-
    -He’s got enough to eat-
    -Yeah-
    -Ok. That’s good to hear. There are some programs that...-
    -...Yeah-
    -How is your friends death affecting you-
    There was a silence. Mr Dadier waited for Montgomery to answer.
Dadier sat by his desk with a note book and pen and tried not to make
too much eye contact with the boy who sat holding a pen and looking at
the note in his hand. The note had said a few things. “Father....”
Montgomery finally looked up and answered,
    -Which one-
Mr Dadier asked, concealing his confusion,
    -I beg you pardon-
Montgomery replied under his breath,
    -S’all good-

*****

    Johnny was on his work experience at the Uncle Bobby’s Bagel House.
He cleaned up there. It was a good job. Johnny had learned a lot about
flour. He also had worked out a plan to creat robots to help him and his
work partners clean up and even make bagels. Robots can sweep. You can
either have them hold the brooms or make it so that they can have
detachable parts. His robots would be better than a vaccum cleaner. They
would play music. Maybe even download mp3s. If he could hook up a deal
with Sony he could get them to play video games and DVDs, too.
    Mr Dadier openned his note book to a new page and asked Johnny how
he was. Johnny sat opposite his “Bongs not Bombs” t-shirt and answered,
    -I’m ok, Mr Dadier-
    -So, John, how are you feeling about Charlies’ death-
    Charlie had helped Johnny type up the daily regular duties on his
computer. Johnny had trouble the first week getting all the things
right. Johnny wanted to make sure that he did a good job. He went over
the list until he knew it by heart. No other worker there, except for
the real professionals, new the routine like he did.
    Johnny thought,

Uncle Bobby’s Bagel House -- CLEANERS Job

1. REGULAR DAILY THINGS ARE THE FOLLOWING:

Stocking Up The Bagels Up Front
Putting All Bagels In Bins

-So what I’m saying Johnny is that you should think about a college. If
robotics is what you want to do-

Clean All The Following:

The Mixer (Thoroughly)
Boiler
Rolling Tables
Blues Wall
Oven Door
Seeding Table
Rising Table
Cinnamon Trays (There Are Two Racks Of Them)
Small Hand Sink

    -Now, there are technical schools, as well that you... or we could
look into-

Flour Room (Sweep/Mop Floor, Wipe Fridges, Take Out Garbage, Scrub The
Floor)
Mop Floor Partially
Scrape Trays
Sweep Floor
Wipe Doors And Counters Off
Bring Some Green Bins Out
Bring Out Flour (22 Bags: White And 2 Bags Brown)

-Why don’t we make an appointment to go to the library and I’ll show how
to look up schools and see what the requirements are-

Organize Recycle Room
Bee Mop The Wall For Brown Drips
Count The Floor Bagels
Mop The Bagel Factory Floor
Count The Leftover Bagels And Put Into Bins
Take Bins To Recycle Room
Take Garbage Out
Bag Bagels For Market When Required
Roll Up Floor Mat
Bag And Throw Away Any Bagels From The Daye Before
Go Home

    -How’s the death of your friend Charlie affecting your life and studies-


2 REGULAR WEEKLY ACTIVITIES INCLUDE:

Clean All The Following:

Under And Behind The Mixer
The Window Sill
The Window And Under The Rising Able
The Cinnamon Gunk Off The Aluminum Freezer Trays

    -He was really special to you, was he not, Johnny-

The Staff Room
The Stock Room
The Insides Of The Fridges
The Boiler Hood
The Oven Hood
The Sesame Oil Off Of The Insides Of The Counter Drawers
5 Green Bins
Wipe Wall Behind Front Bagels
Take Out Cardboard

    -Do you know what all that was about with Frank and Montgomery in
school this     morning-

Water Front Flower Boxes
Sweep  Front Side Walk And Back Parkin ing lot
Scrub Flour Pallet Clean
Wash Oven Mitts
Take Old Bulletins Down

    Johnny really wanted to make robots. Mr. Dadier said something about
school. But he was probably going to be a cleaner all his life. His
daddy was. Where the hell is U Vic anyway? If he wasn’t going to be a
cleaner why would they send him out to a Uncle Bob’s Bagel House?


*****

     When Benjamin finally answered Mr Dadiers’ question and concerns
about Charlie all he could say was,
-Would you get your mind out of the headlines. Maybe it wasn’t a
suicide. Maybe it was  a warning-
Mr Dadier asked,
    -What warning, Ben-
    -Our ol Suns and Moons-
    -I’m afraid I’m...-
-Ah....  you ever read The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels
of Steel?     Hedda Gabler? FM 5-31 Department of the Army Field Manual?

it's the queen's writ, to be sure, you can read it in the wind, it's
graphology. god is a voiceover discerned by signs turned as such on the
lathe of experience. we're heading towards the interior, mine own, squalls
lead the way. the machines shudder in the almost-dark, you can hear the
native clarinets murmured in the distance. all distances are great, saith
the lord, all winds from nowhere, all destinations cut short by the love
of death. the lord inculcates all i do and think. religion's always on my
mind, when it isn't dad, and the two are identical, now aren't they. you
can see the packet spurts, shape-riding in this environment is more like a
roller-coaster than anything else, holy-roller to be sure. the wind blows
out, grey clouds unfurl the sky once again in the almost-dark. this is the
image of a picture in the text of the steganographic image. the terrorists
need help. i'm in the valleys of the appalachians of pennsylvania, we're
all in training here, but for what?:day two on dad's machines, the natives
here are restless, we'll take care of it, get rid of the dirty bomb,
literally, the earth throws it off-course, solar panels in disarray,
mayday or some such, but who'd approach? not on your life they say, at
least the machine works slow like a leak, word after word coming in, none
too fast of course - there are winds on the sea, winds within, they caress
me, dawn, there are winds on the sea, winds within, they caress me, dawn,
you can read it in the wind

your there are masts in the land, masts in the sea, what of them and their
brawn, your place among you

there are masts in the land, masts in the sea, what of them and their brawn
you can read it, you can read it in the wind

Hi David,

       I am a big fan of Mr. Ed Sanders but I can't get to New York for this
coming Wednesday. I just want to say
thank you to him for 'The Cutting Prow' and his performance of it in the old
Poetry in Motion film. It's long ago, but everytime the subject of poetry
about paintings comes up on lists like this, and it does so regularly, his
remarkably touching tribute to Matisse in his late years, comes to mind.

In Praise of Writer's Block | An Essay by David Alpaugh

David Alpaugh's essay "The Professionalization of Poetry" was serialized
in two issues of POETS & WRITERS MAGAZINE in 2003. It drew over two
hundred letters and emails and was widely discussed on the internet.
Alpaugh's poetry, fiction, drama and criticism have appeared in numerous
journals and anthologies, including EXQUISITE CORPSE, THE FORMALIST,
MODERN DRAMA, POETRY, TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE, THE LITERATURE OF
WORK, and CALIFORNIA POETRY FROM THE GOLD RUSH TO THE PRESENT. His
collection COUNTERPOINT won the Nicholas Roerich Poetry Prize from Story
Line Press and his chapbooks have been published by Coracle Books and
Pudding House Publications. A graduate of Rutgers University and the
University of California, Berkeley, where he was a Woodrow Wilson and Ford
Foundation fellow, Alpaugh operates Small Poetry Press, a chapbook design
and printing service, and edits its Select Poets Series. He has taught at
the U.C., Berkeley extension and hosts one of the San Francisco Bay Area's
most popular monthly poetry reading venues. He was a guest speaker at the
Squaw Valley Community of Writers in 2003 and defended the controversial
thesis of "The Professionalization of Poetry" at the AWP 2004 Convention
in Chicago.

Published on Wednesday, August 11, 2004 by the Toronto Star
Kerry Fails Iraq Test
Editorial

What do Americans need in their president, post-9/11? Strong leadership,
of course. Clear vision. Common sense. And in a dangerous, fast-changing
world, the capacity to learn from past mistakes would be helpful.

Senator John Kerry, the Democrat who hopes to elbow President George Bush
from office on Nov. 2, promises all of the above and more. But there was
little of it on display Monday, when Kerry responded to Bush's challenge
to spell out where he stands on the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

Rising to Bush's bait, Kerry said he would have cast the same Yes vote in
Congress that he did on Oct. 11, 2002, to authorize the president to
launch a pre-emptive war that began March 19, 2003, even if Kerry had
known that Saddam Hussein had no ties with Al Qaeda terrorists, no weapons
of mass destruction and posed no real threat to the world.

"I believe it's the right authority for a president to have," Kerry now
says. Only he would have used that power more "effectively."

This amounts to a sweeping claim by Kerry that America has carte blanche
to make war on even bogus grounds, and in defiance of the United Nations
and world opinion, so long as the war is waged effectively.

It's depressing from a candidate who has attacked Bush for "misleading"
the nation, who promises a better direction and who claims to want to
re-engage with the world.

Kerry's vote in 2002, while misguided, was defensible. Bush had
exaggerated Saddam's threat, and had won over 7 in 10 Americans to the
view that the Iraq war was justified.

But since then, the U.N. has been vindicated. Saddam was contained; there
were no ties to the 9/11 terrorists; and Iraq had no nuclear, chemical or
biological weapons.

That leaves most Americans feeling misled, or duped. They can see the
damage to U.S. prestige internationally. The loss of more than 1,000
American and allied lives, and 16,000 Iraqi lives . A $200-billion cost.

And they see no easy exit.

All this is baggage Bush should carry to the polls, alone. But Kerry has
just re-endorsed his misguided policy, if not its clumsy delivery.

No wonder Kerry is struggling to pull ahead in a race with a president who
has not delivered promised jobs and who is seen as a friend of the rich
and powerful.

Practical politics undoubtedly prompted Kerry's reply. He is loath to
admit he cast a foolish vote in 2002. He does not want to alienate voters
who were similarly duped, and who are not keen to be reminded of it. And
he must not be seen as "soft" on Saddam.

But Kerry comes off looking like "Bush lite" on Iraq, rather than as a
candidate with better values and a sounder program. He seems weak.
Muddled. Has he learned nothing from a slew of American investigations
that have exposed the sloppiness of U.S. intelligence and the shabbiness
of the rationale for war?

This is a letdown for American voters who yearn for a real alternative,
and a healthier direction. It is not good news for the world, either.

To Ishaq's emails--which are often, if I remember correctly, postings of
other people's writings as well as his own--regarding the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, to Stephen Baraban's critique of it, to Ian's
defense of it, to Jill Stengel's critique of excerpts of Ian's email, to
what has seemed to me for some time now the nearly impossible task of
finding a language in which to talk about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict:

That does not conflate the specifics of a particular religious rhetoric with
the people who practice all the myriad forms that religion might take;

That does not conflate age-old canards--Jew-hating; Arab-hating; take your
pick--with the legitimate desire to understand and explain, investigate and
critique, the politics of those two communities--here, in the Middle East,
in France, Malaysia, again: take your pick;

A language that does not personalize what are reasonable questions about
those communities, no matter how uncomfortable those questions might be to
members of those communities, i.e., the fact that, to quote Ian, "jihad is a
universal term that refers to the spirit of Islam," does not mean that the
bloody and violent version of jihad promulgated by sectors within the Muslim
community is not now part of Islam that stands in relation to the other
meaning(s) of jihad that also exist; the fact that Jew-hating canards about
Jewish money make it uncomfortable for Jews to think about the power and
influence that money gives to Jews does not mean that Jews in the United
States do not have some--and I mean here a very equivocal "some"--power and
influence that we have an obligation to take responsibility for, especially
in relation to the more far-reaching powerlessness and marginaliztion in
this country of Arabs and Muslims;

A language that does not take itself so seriously that it loses sight of how
sarcasm and humor can be effective tools in finding the language I am
talking about--and I should add that this is not a left-handed attempt to
defend the comments by Ian that Jill critiques--"However, EVERYONE
recognizes the injustices done to the Palestinians. Well, sorry, except for
some rich Jews in NY" and "the Jews do have a strong base in key states (ie
New York and probably Florida) and major Universities (ie SUNY
Albany)"--which, even if they were meant in some sort of jest, were not
funny. I am thinking more of Ian's closing statement--"Think twice though,
because the leader of the Free Palestine movement in Albany is a practicing
Jew, Naomi Jaffi... Weather Underground what what!--which seemed clearly to
me to be his own response to the generalizations he'd made earlier;

A language that does not force allegiance to one side or the other to demand
of us that we lose sight of the other side's humanity. I am thinking of this
quote from Susan Sontag's, "To an Israeli Jew, a photograph of a child torn
apart in the attack on the Sbarro pizzeria in downtown Jerusalem is first of
all a photograph of Jewish child killed by a Palestinian suicide-bomber. To
a Palestinian, a photograph of a child torn apart by a tank round in Gaza is
first of all a photograph of a Palestinian child killed by Israeli
ordinance. To the militant, identity is everything." And precisely because
the people who will find whatever lasting resolution comes out of this
conflict will not be militants--assuming the resolution is not mutual
destruction--we need to find a way of talking about it that does not get us
mired in identity issues.

As a Jew, I find the generalizations made in Ian's email troubling and I
find as well the use of the label Zionist in Ishaq's reposting to be
troubling as well--each participates, or potentially participates, in a long
history of worldwide anti-Semitism that no Jewish person can afford to
ignore, and it seems to me that people who want to talk about the role of
Zionism in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict--and Zionism absolutely plays a
role--and/or about the role of Jews as a relatively powerful minority in the
United States, and perhaps elsewhere in the world, have a responsibility to
educate themselves about the history of the rhetoric they wish to employ,
not because, as some people in my wife's family have informed me--my wife is
a Muslim--"no one is allowed to criticize the Jews," but because, just as
Muslims have a right to expect that anyone entering into a discussion of
jihad will at least attempt to understand that concept in its simplicity and
its complexity from the Muslim point of view, and to understand how the term
has been used against Muslims in the past, Jews have the right to expect
that people wanting to talk about our community will do the same in terms of
the way we talk about our own community and the way in which the world has
talked about us.

It is not a Muslim's job to educate me about Islam, especially when he feels
himself in endangered by a group that I belong to--even if I do not support
what the group is doing--and nor is it my job to educate someone who is not
Jewish about their own attitudes regarding Jews. The work of learning about
and accepting The Other is work we have to do first and foremost by
ourselves and for ourselves; otherwise, it is empty work.

Now, having said all that, I think it is also important to point out that
the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is not simply one of Muslim vs. Jew. There
are Christian Palestinians and there are Israelis who are not Jewish, and I
am not thinking only here about Israeli-Arabs, and, for me, the fact that
the conflict is so often represented, on both sides, as one between two
religious groups--Jews and Muslims--suggests why it is so important not to
trust the religious rhetoric of either side when it is employed to describe,
define or propose modes of action in response to or solutions for the
conflict. It is almost impossible, once you get people's ideas about their
particular god involved, to get past the immovable block of identity,
because there will always be, on either side, the sneaking suspicion that
"my god is bigger than your god," or, to be more specific, that "my god is
right and your god is, if not wrong, then certainly less right."

There is a great deal more to say on this, I imagine, but I am looking at
the clock and I need to get to the library and do some work.

Cheers!

Richard

Richard, a public Thanks for your good (sane) post re Ishaq, Ian, etc. and
the larger issue.

Today I am terrified of the ramifications of Marines in Najef (sp?) blowing
up the center of the Shia world. So little do I know. But I do know if
someone blew up Saint Patrick's Cathedral in New York (or some comparable
shrine/icon), all hell would follow in its name.

I am expecting the worse from all of this. Cactus shrines in the desert will
become the safest place of worship - no matter one's belief system.

It's amazing - re Najef - there is only mostly American public silence in
the face of what this may all further precipitate. What is this? Collective
submission to the Evangelical love of fire & smoke as preliminary to the
promise of Eternal Rapture? Jeezus! I pray some saner forces bring in
secular hoses, immediately!

Not death wishing this morning!

Lockdown in Orono
dormitory:
Spartan bunks
thin white towels
and
no hangers
four cells to a sour suite
one sink and one pod-shaped shower

At the conference we discuss Pound at St. Elizabeth, Beckett’s “siege in the room,”
Everson’s C.O. camp, Japanese internment camp poets, and HUAC’s hounding of
Williams, not to forget Kafka’s Parable of the Door

Then, after cash bar and open mic readings
and more cash bar,
we return to our nightly acquiescent incarceration
fumbling with the codes that allow access
to outer door
middle door
inner door

And I gather this is so
we can experience
the monastic life of Castalia
practicing the hierophantic mode
hermetically sealed
till  dawn’s rosy-fingers
free us
and we drown
in love’s sweet song

Peace,

Jews were not mentioned.
Zionism does not = Anti-semiticism.
Semites are not Jews.
Jews are not the issue.
Nor is Islam.

he a Muslim, just another victim of the samo ethnic and racial
cleansing that Palestinians (who are Muslims and were Jews and Christians)

and subjugated to for centuries by tyrants and oppressors.

>>Jews were not mentioned.<<



True, not in Ishaq's original post, but Ian did mention Jews; also Ishaq's
post did include the term Zionist, which includes Jews by definition. See
below.



>>Zionism does not = Anti-semiticism<<



I assume you mean anti-Zionism does not equal anti-semitism which is
true--though I must confess, even though I am not always consistent (old
habits die hard), I prefer the term Jew-hatred to anti-semitism.
Anti-Zionism can indeed mean Jew-hatred, and it has--with often deadly
consequences for Jews--and it sometimes still does, and I would say it is
incumbent on the person who wants to speak out against Zionism to
demonstrate that he or she is not a Jew-hater (which is a much less elegant,
if perhaps more expressive and accurate adjectival than anti-semitic), not
necessarily in some explicit disclaimer, but in the precision of his or her
language, the historical awareness, etc. that he or she brings to the
critique. This is a responsibility that comes with presuming to speak,
critically or otherwise, about a group one is not a part of, especially when
what one is talking about is part of the history of that group's oppression.
I make this as a statement of principle, not as a critique of Ishaq or of
the person who's writing he posted to this list; I don't know enough about
either of them or their work to say anything about them specifically in this
regard.



>>Jews are not the issue.

Nor is Islam.<<



Ideally, it would be nice if this were the case, but the fact is that people
on both sides of the fence--which is now, of course, literal--make Jews and
Judaism and Muslims and Islam the issue and not to address that fact is
disingenuous at best and extremely dangerous at worst.



What motivated my original post was my own feeling that the exchange
engendered by Ishaq's post was about to devolve into a very familiar
argument in which neither side really listened to what the other had to say
and responded instead to button-pushing language that was button pushing
more because it was not precise and not thought through than because the
person using it hated Jews or Palestinians or whomever. Ishaq's very terse
response, while technically accurate, risks perpetuating that dynamic
precisely because it appears to elide issues that, in my opinion at least,
should not be elided.

Apologies for duplicates, cross posting or if this information does not
interest you.

Notes To A Stranger invites you to complete the 2004 mission between Sept
4-11. Circulate and participate.

Welcome to the 2004 Notes to a Stranger Festival where poets from around the
world are asked to join us in creating a new 'public library'. A library
that is transient, personal and dynamic. A library forged by the invisible
traces inside the 'Seven Degrees of Separation'; where poets leave notes to
strangers in the covers of poetry books and then leave them in a specially
chosen public space. The books are launched into a life of public nakedness.
They become mobile and vagrant. Please join us by completing the template
below and fulfilling your mission. To read last year's mission files, visit
the www.nationalpoetryweek.com website and click on the S-Files 2003 button.
I look forward to litters of poetry books squirming their way through public
spaces.

If you want to accept the mission, please submit via email by completing the
template below.

Poet's mission file::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Here's the tenor what was the tone of a writ:

Native peoples and the poor, the Latinos and Blacks have been and are
murdered
daily on this stolen land -- stealing land cleansing it of their
Original Peoples tends to be habit with certain shade (Y) sets of people.
 ...the innercity concentration camps, barrios, ghettos to reservations
and "occupied' TERRORtory and I'll mention the
ghettoization/gentrification of my hood and iraq and afrika possibly all
of al jazeera
in this the pimped portion of the jazzy era sampled into activity be it
for Freedome Justice Equality all of whom are divinity
 ...  are not seperate issues B.U.T a singularity nor are their
oppressors seperate for the oppressors claim the the same gang

"so go call upon your gang" = tyrannts

do you view yourself as a tyrant?

4 U Cee

Anthany James Dawson (11 Aug 99), Gerald Kaboni, Frank Paul, Neil
Stonechild,
over 500 missing native women, 60 + 1 murdered native, black  women and
poor
white women by a white man (w/ a pig farm = swine herder) in kkkanada
alone not to mention the united snakes
are the issue.

not sitting pretty in academia and kvetchin about being impotent over
israel

oh people

We shall call the guards of hell

...and go tell/it/the story/on the mountain tops

stout like momotaro

how low can U go

we gon chase devilz

...now for the tenor

what was a poem concerning tone:

...theres nothing gentle about a bomb


"...and an outer struggle begins with an inner struggle

As our peoples are being assaulted and bullied physically with bombs and
shelling and radiations poisoning, as well as, rapes and disease, we are
being attacked by the pen and the net and in public with harsh words
cruelity and dumb founding callousness. ...and it makes us afraid cuz we
live among these people -- it's like discovering that you have walked
into nieghbourhood of serial killers and vampires who consider such
conduct as normal and civilized. All our morality has been turned round.
Killing the poor is good and so is greed as is mass murder. ...and
belief in kindness courtesy and compassion is considered foolish. TO be
loyal and ethical is something for fools, so we are told. ...and all our
passion can be wiped away with a "hit and run" quip and cyber smirk and
lowbrow joke to make the bored romans seated in the arena giggle -- we
are told today that this is courage. ...B.U.T. what about the thousands
dead in Iraq? what about the murder of our native bredden (which our so
called 'activist' and 'anarchist' remain impotent in their "activISM' to
address)? what about the killing of the poor in British Columbia by the
jakes? what about the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in the ever
growing middle-east and the whitemail and harassement by north
amerikkkan zionist that we should say nothing about it? what about the
gentrification of our hoods? what about using the poor as babymaking
machines? what about the left so called activists, who act just like the
aryan nation, only they hide behind privialge, white feminism, the
gaygousie, consume tofu and claim a safe cause celeb to attack all the
samo niggers that the powers have always attacked? What about all the
supremacy of the great white north who when confronted or criticized are
the first to holla "racism"? as they call a kkkop gang to kill the
niggers and the natives and poor? ...again - what about Anthany James
Dawson (11 Aug 99)? Gerald Kaboni, Frank Paul? Jeff Berg and the
countless others and the daily deaths of our shahada/our martrys? in
this the ethnic, cultural and economic cleansing in the western puscht
for power and property".

(n.b. The hate that's spilled over on this list recently is frightening.
I've lived in Israel. I've been shot at. Let me put it this way - the
Jew's are Europe's garbage. Now they're becoming the garbage of the left.
Convenient. Fassbinder had it right. So did Sartre. Before you accuse
anyone of anything look to yourself. Your tendency.)

Dear Richard- Thank you for your very sincere e-mail, but my intent is not
to belittle the sufferings of Jewish people nor to fall into any stereotypes
of my people, Roman Catholics (Right now I am practicing with the Church of
Lebanon, aka the Maronites who are recognized by the pope but do not follow
the Roman mass. In other words, no latin & instead Aremaic. We can discuss
the politics of the Roman Catholic Church without offending my faith).
However, many of my statements can & will be backed up by the personal
stories of political organizers (one in particular) who suffered immensely
at the hands of rich Zionists in the United States. I only remember her
first name, Rosa, & currently she is organizing (or so I hear) out of NYC.
She is more of a legend than a person to me. In my time at SUNY Albany it
was a well known fact that the President of the University regularly met
with Hillel (please forgive misspelling) and at one particular point in the
1980's or 90's threatened to pull money from an afrikan american group on
campus because "they supported anti-semiticism" which was just an outright
lie. SUNY Albany students actually had to use underground strategies to
bring speakers to the campus to support a platfrom of Diverse resistance. I
will not even mention how the organizing for Fred Hampton Jr. was treated
(not that I had made any major contribution to it, but I did attend & that
introduced me to Dead Prez).
     Especially after WWII, the world recognizes the suffering of Jews.
However, one genocide does not exclude another & personally I can not stand
by watching how Isreal uses the language of the Jewish Holocaust to justify
their expansion (aren't they planning new settlements every chance they
get?). Not to mention the fact that everything Isreal has been doing is
against ALL international laws. As Noam Chomsky points out time and time
again, the problem is not Isreal or Palestine, but the United States who
funds Zionists in Isreal. Everyone knows that GW is superstitious, but has
anyone taken into account what a religious nut he might actually be. One
good article I read in Albany's Metroland investigated a claim that GW meets
regularly with apocolyptic Christians just to make sure everythings kosher
so to speak. It is a common perception in MY current town in North Carolina
(which I refuse to read any more poetry in) that boys are being born to
fight the Christian holy war. Who's crazy for saying Jihad?
     Ironically wouldn't Palestinians be classified as semetic people? I
thought that term referred more to a race than a religion? Again, I could be
wrong.
   John Kerry on the hand is just a good ole fashioned hippocrite. As
another article pointed out quite effectively (from a Conservative
Republican), there is NO difference between the foreign policy of Kerry &
that of Bush. I think I agree. As for sources, wisdom is often best & one
particular piece of wisdom I enjoy is "believe none of what you hear & half
of what you see." Also, don't forget that the only Catholic President of the
United States was SHOT in Texas. It doesn't even matter who pulled the
trigger.
Ian VanHeusen
PS. Don't vote, it only encourages them... from now on I'll just stick to
poetry & leave the politicking to the pros.

this reminds  me of MOntreal's Bikeshevik Velorutionaries. fucking
brilliant!


Subject: [noRNC] Bikes Against Bush - an Internet-enabled protest

I wanted to tell you about Bikes Against Bush, an exciting project I am
producing for the upcoming Republican National Convention. Bikes
Against Bush is a one-of-a-kind, interactive protest/performance that
occurs simultaneously online and on the streets of NYC during the
upcoming Republican National Convention. Using a Wireless
Internet-enabled bicycle outfitted with a custom-designed printing
device, the Bikes Against Bush bicycle can print spray-chalk text
messages sent from web users directly onto the streets of Manhattan.

Please visit http://www.bikesagainstbush.com for more info and to watch
a video of the Bikes Against Bush bicycle in action.

During the convention, online users will be able to follow the
performance on the website as well as send a message to the bicycle in
real-time. So, even if you can't be in New York to oppose the GOP, you
can interject your anti-Bush sentiments directly onto the city streets
through Bikes Against Bush. Exact performance times will be announced
on the website in the coming weeks.

If you wish to support this exciting project, please consider
contributing a donation through the website at:
http://www.bikesagainstbush.com.

Thank you so much for all your efforts. With your help we can send a
message to America and send George Bush back to Crawford, TX, this
November.

Sincerely,
Joshua Kinberg

Ian, you wrote that

>>many of my statements can & will be backed up by the personal stories of
political organizers (one in particular) who suffered immensely at the hands
of rich Zionists in the United States.<<

I do not doubt that these stories are true; certainly there are people in
the Jewish community who, through conscious, racist intent or willfully
ignorant and therefore no less malign neglect, could care less about the
Palestinians and are perfectly happy to support Israel in its policies. The
fact that those personal stories are true, however, does not absolve you, or
anyone, of the responsibility of being precise in your language. I note, for
example, that in your last post you referred to rich Jews, while in this one
you refer to rich Zionists, a big difference, though it is problematic for
me that anyone, including Jews, would use the term Zionist as if it
represented a monolithic entity, because it never has, and I want to be
clear that I am not saying people should not use the term Zionist in a
critique of Israel. I am saying only that when people choose to use the
term, they have a responsibility to make sure they understand as full a
history of what they are talking about as possible.

You also, in your post, make reference to the fact that since World War II
everyone knows about the suffering of the Jews. And, yes, I agree with you
that it is shameful for Israel to try to justify what it is doing using
Holocaust rhetoric; though the rhetoric arguing for a Jewish state--whether
or not you support its existence as such--looks a whole lot different if you
consider it from the perspective of the Jews in Europe, whose lives up until
the 19th century resembled in many ways the lives that people of color,
especially but not only poor people of color, live in the United States,
including, if you include Nazi Germany and the 20th century, slavery. My
point is that the Jew-hatred and the "suffering of the Jews" neither began
nor ended with the Holocaust; it has a long, long history, especially in
Europe within the Roman Catholic Church--which is a historical fact, not a
dig--and just as it is important to understand, say, the history or racism
in the US if one wants to talk responsibly about racism in the US today; or
just as it is important to understand the history of the Palestinians if one
wants to talk responsibly about the Palestinians today; it is important to
understand the history of Jew-hatred and of the Jews' response to that
hatred in all the various places Jews have lived if one wants to talk
responsibly about the Jews today. Now, I do not mean that one needs to know
everything before one can speak, but it does mean that one should take
responsibility for what one does and does not know. There is a big
difference between telling a personal story about "a rich Zionist" or a
college president or whoever, who behaved as you describe them behaving and
suggesting that there are probably--because of course there are--a group of
people who share that person's values and making generalizations about rich
Jews or rich Zionists. The former grounds what you are saying in personal
experience; the latter makes you sound like you are indeed spouting
stereotypes that are not only Jew-hating--and I am not accusing you here,
only describing what those generalizations sound like--but will, almost by
definition, end whatever dialogue might have been possible.

Richard

I will not deny that my life, now, is immeasurably more privileged than the
people about whom you are writing, than many of my students, who come from
the kinds of communities you are talking about, and that I benefit, in ways
that I sometimes can and in ways that I very often cannot, from the
political system that grants me the privilege in the first place. It was not
always like that. I know what it means to be poor, and I know what it means
on two different fronts to be stalked and hunted, and I do not use those
words as metaphors, because of who and what you are--on one front because I
was a boy and on the other because I was a Jew--and I am very aware of how
fortunate I am to have survived in each of those cases. I am also very aware
of how irrelevant and rarefied and even irresponsible the kind of questions
I was asking in my post can seem to someone who is, as I am not now, on the
front lines of the battle you describe, and I do not deny that it is a
battle. I try to take responsibility for the privilege of my position in any
number of ways, including the form and content of my teaching--which I think
is a kind of activism, as do many of my colleagues, and which is why it will
not surprise me if academia does not become in its own way a front line as
well. But I also think that asking the kinds of questions I was asking in
the post to which you are responding, precisely because I have the luxury of
distance from the situation in question, is a way of taking responsibility,
because it is a way of using that distance to insist that people talk about
things responsibly. Not that I would expect a Palestinian living under
occupation, or any of the people in the communities you refer to, to care
one iota about my questions; my questions will not help them survive
physically and without physical survival, my questions are worse than
irrelevant; they are an insult. But my questions were not directed at people
in the immediate line of fire; they were directed at people who have the
privilege and the luxury of conversing with each other over the internet,
and those people, in my opinion, especially because they are not in the line
of fire, have a responsibility to speak with each other in the ways that I
am suggesting we are all responsible for doing.

Ultimately, real coalitions, coalitions that last and that make a real
difference, are built on the ability of people to talk to each other
meaningfully across differences that might at first seem insurmountable, and
that means learning about each other and each other's history from within
its own perspective and respecting that perspective, and accepting its
meaningfulness to the other side, even when you don't agree with it. Finding
language that makes that kind of communication possible is damned hard, but
it matters, in its own way, as much as any other kind of activism.

it seems to me that we all --ian, ishaq (lyb), richard, alan, etc
--want to alleviate --in this case by calling attention to --
suffering, oppression and exploitation in the world.  not all jews
are zionists, not all zionists are racist, etc. i tend to agree w/
richard that one should try to be aware of what one does and doesn't
know; i tend to agree w/ ishaq that ultimately, jews and muslims
aren't the issue.  does that mean that ultimately, any kind of
"identity" isn't the issue?  it seems that suffering, exploitation
and oppression, while often organized around various axes of
identity, are not limited to identitarian means of self-perpetuation.
i try to view myself as a tyrant and a victim and a free person
--both encumbered and unencumbered by the constraints of human
suffering in all its guises and modalities --at all moments. i also v
much appreciate the respectful tone that everyone seems to be
engaging.  these are volatile issues indeed and i hesitated before
getting involved, but i see a considerable amount of goodwill on all
sides, so i decided to take the plunge. xo, md

Agonies of language are entwined within the Israeli-Palestinian conflict --
and that's not just Arabic and Hebrew.  Even the terms for expressing
elements of the struggle, even the names of entire peoples, are
contested.  So, it's always appropriate to discuss this on a list that
engages in language.

The construction of "rich Jews" is one that echoes classic anti-Semitism
(and anti-Semitism in this instance is animus towards Jews,
specifically).  However, there are indeed rich Jews who number among the
supporters of the most extremist settlers -- Moskowitz from Miami who has
gotten rich over gambling casinos, for example.  Jews also number amongst
the most outspoken opponents of the Israeli occupation, and some of them
are even rich (not this Jew, though).  All of this is complicated further
by the concerted campaign on the part of the Zionist movement since the
1973 to equate Judaism with Zionism.  Consequently, Jews who criticize
Israel have been too easily labeled as "self-hating Jews," while non-Jewish
critics are too easily dismissed as "anti-Semites."  Now, add to this that
the biggest supporters of Israel are Christian fundamentalists -- whose
theological vision involves the death of most Jews in order for their god
to return to earth, in other words a pro-Zionist stance that is, also,
inherently anti-Semitic (I rate any religious or other scenario that
invokes the murder of Jews as anti-Semitic).  Given the confusions
(deliberate or not) on all sides, it is almost impossible to discuss the
conflict without displaying either anti-Semitism or anti-Arab/anti-Muslim
bigotry or both simultaneously.  Still, intelligent people need to make an
effort to peel back all the layers of confusion.

Yet further: the West seems to have confronted (at least to a degree) the
crimes of the mass murder of European Jews, while it has not come anywhere
close to confronting its crimes of colonialism.  The media, of course, does
a lot to enforce all these attitudes and linguistic constructions -- helped
by AIPAC and others who "educate" the media and put the squeeze on
politicians.  Today, for example, there is an article in the New York Times
about how the Mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert, has become something of a
"dove" after being one of the most rightwing exponents of a "Greater
Israel."  His logic is that he cannot advocate the continued occupation
because it would mean absorbing too many Arabs (who remain within the 1967
borders but also in the West Bank and Gaza after previous "ethnic
cleansing" wars) and he would have to choose between a Jewish state that
would be non-democratic and a democratic state that may encompass a
majority of Palestinians.  Apparently, he has abandoned his mentor
Jabotinsky's policy of "transfer" -- pushing out by force the remaining
Palestinians -- in favor of what one Israeli peace advocate has termed
"slow motion transfer," a drawn-out war of attrition to expel as many
Palestinians from areas of the West Bank he intends Israel to keep through
economic and other forms of misery (such as the current wall dividing
farmers from their fields).  The Times does not seem to recognize that his
move towards what appears to be a dovish stance is still predicated on
notions of ethnic superiority and colonial expropriation.

I could go on at length -- and I have in the past.  Others should sort this
through.  Meanwhile, I gave a presentation at a conference last Spring on
these relationships (as well as the notion of patriotism in America) called
"On Being a Traitor."  It will be published in a journal eventually, but if
you would like to read it, send me a message and I'll send it to you via
Word attachment.

marriage is better than nuptials
money is better than lucre

your face as you speak?
truth is better than veracity
At the beginning she told you

to understand is better than comprehend
Alone with the hum

"I've got more important things to busy myself with than you and your =
salt. I want to do something about China, communism, and the grape =
growers in California."

"What's wrong with China?"

"There's no political democracy there," said Lieberman grumpily, "and no =
freedom of the press."

"No shit," said Gold with feigned amazement. "What did you have in =
mind?"

"A manifesto, of course, by me, in the form of a petition, with a list =
of non-negotiable demands, insisting they change. I'll need supporting =
names."

"Count me in," said Gold.

"And a special issue of my magazine in which you and others express my =
feelings in two thousand words."

"How much will you pay?"

"Nothing."

"Count me out."

Lieberman retorted with the savage fervor of a maddened fanatic. "You =

because you won't give up a few bucks?

the rubies been backwards
in that verbatim Wormswork Kingdom fact
the rubies note their filched fellow is
pursuing Wormswork upon his very forehead
tho very distant, see these glances are
head-bare tonight, crossed one head
with two faces (which face, to begin with?
Wordsworth or Wormswork? reminds me of
when a child read The Martian Chronicles
as a novel, never having encountered a
collection of short stories before, wondering
why the characters never came back, not
having seen them die or having any other
explanation - might as well give the kid
Ulysses to read - later, knowing what
a book of short stories was, encountered
Roderick Usher again, via Poe), what came
before is already the away utterance when
excuses reached their own forms, they're
reviving with loose body interest, loaned
a mouth for trial, but which mouth will go
on to tell the outcome? the mouth that
flutters in a sleepy face? - something about
When Husks Are Patches, maybe double
back and sing with hands, Wormswork,
more than one way, yes, but hope they,
the rubies, for instance, see it as applause

How does one respond indeed? I'm English, and live in one of the most
mixed-race cities in Europe. It doesn't bother me, about the only prejudices
I have are a dislike for people from Wolverhampton and a secret fantasy that
Birmingham City will one day win the European Cup. Now that's unreality
indeed!!!

Subject:      Codespeak & Liquid Swords (Poetics for Revolution)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Although it has been understood that linguistics, poetics, & all the
faculties of spirituality were employed by slaves in the American South to
organize underground resistance through coded & open communication, the
depth of these systems probably should become the focus for the poetics of
Revolution. To date, the focus of activism has been to spread as opposed to
concentrate around the local, to narrow & produce results. In this manner,
LangoPo would be seen not as a garbbled mess (which it often is) but a new
plateau for the ability to spread underground information through public
spaces that are quickly be limited (as show by the Spam attack e-mail of
Ishaq's) or better yet a direct attack on Centralized society itself
(monoculture etc.). Misinformation was the key term for Cointelpro in the
60's & 70's, but I think the outright destruction of channels of information
will be the new policy of Homeland Security. In my humble opinion, the last
possibility of producing a common area for the non-commerical exchange of
information only exists on the internet. All other facets of life, with the
notable except of some indigenous cultures, have been commericialized & are
primarily controled by the logic of capitalism. In this sense, schools teach
but they also destroy the possibility of free exchange.
   I recommend Liquid Swords not for its content (Bitches Whores & drugs)
but rather for its central claim, and in my opinion that claim is that
Hip-hop at its nature organized & maintained huge underground networks of
drug trafficking & communication. As my dear friend Victorio Reyes has put
it, hip-hop communicates across the world to oppressed peoples everywhere
(bad paraphrase). The comparison is to the spiritual & physical confict of
Eastern Martial Arts masters. In a world of violence, they claim to be the
hardest individuals. In this sense, Liquid Swords is an incomplete guide to
street knowledge (you really should listen to it very closely). Furthermore,
it was written before 911 & outlines many layers of Cells that may or may
not have existed in NYC. Connecting Brooklyn to Staten Island, etc. Cell
Theory was developed by the CIA & given to the Mujahadeen, but in reality it
probably started & was developed by organized crime. It is my opinion that
all future wars (except for the monolithic occupations of the world powers)
will be faught primarily using cells. The results of this kind of warfare is
never victory & defeat but rather the continued fragmentation of centralized
societies (such as the United States) who have everything to lose by tribal
societies.
     In conclusion, this is a bit of a garbled mess, but the Fear of
Terrorism is more of a government superstition to maintain the status quo
then a reality for most Americans. Furthermore, my true concern is that
without a drastic redefinition of society very soon (a revolution) the world
could very well end in Nuclear Holocaust not an apocoloypse. With
centralized power more & more being threatened by the society at large, it
is scary to think that as a last resort leaders such as GW might resort to a
Nuclear attack. Do we really know how crazy those guys are?

Subject:      A little biography of a Revolutionary
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I am currently seeking a publisher for my first book, I figured I would
explain myself a bit to illustrate where I "am coming from."
Hello my name is Ian VanHeusen, who one might call a chameleon who never
changes his colors once he has decided upon them. My color is the black of
Anarchismo or Zapatismo depending on how you want to approach the subject.
I am currently broke & without a job but I do not have to worry because my
father is high brass in the United States Army & he fought hard for his
reputation (Panama, Berlin, 101st, 82nd Infantry, Iraq part 1 where he was
actually in Iraq for the entire ground war, Saudia Arabia, Marine Amphibious
Warfare School, the list is probably a lot longer). He is probably the best
example of what Rumsfeld wanted to create as the new army (modeled slightly
after the German Bliztkreig), the army of one. He was offered a job working
for Homeland Security. In other words, he has recieved cross training in
many fields (Ranger, Air Assault, Marines) & has a shit ton of experience.
His accomplishments are public, and he enlisted into the military to pay off
college. At the time he had three children & could barely make a living as a
carpenter (no joke, so don't even say it) outside of Buffalo. It is
difficult to explain where I am from because I was 2 when my father first
joined the Army. As a child I was considered mentally handicapped because I
did not learn to speak until the age of 4 (and I had a thick German accent),
but since then I have always had very good grades (not that it means
anything). Furthermore, my father converted to Catholicism from
Protestantism because he found it difficult to deal with the in fighting of
Christian Politics. Furthermore, he never talks about religion.
My sister is currently stationed in Ansbach Germany where she is strongly
considering going to Iraq, actually might request it. One of her assignments
was as a foreign advisor to the Isreal Army, which is ironic because many
people often confuse her and me as being Jewish (not that there is anything
wrong with that). She is a single beautiful West Point Grad who has never
known life outside of the Army. My brother is a football coach at Princeton
and looks completely different from my sister & me.
As for wars, my family (the VanHeusen side) proudly states that we have
fought in every major war that this country has every had. Ask my Grandma.
As such, it has always been taught to us that to fight for oneself & one's
country (better yet one's cause) is the most important thing that can be
done. Consequently, I often come off as very militant. Jee I wonder why. My
family has a saying for the difference between Military life & everything
else. We call everything else, "The real world." As for my politics, I will
gladly say that my family has done its time, but maybe it is more important
to pay for the crime. One more tidbit, I am a descendant of the Mayflower
(White) so one might say that I am "all American." My mom side is
Irish-French Catholic now running 4 or 5 generations off the boat. Nice huge
family full of Catholic stereotypes, she had 12 brothers & sisters & her
first meal at a nice restaurant was a date with my father. If you think you
can sympathize with the life of an army brat, then you really better be
brilliant. Sadly, I forgot to worry about if my dad was coming home & he was
gone often.
My pen name is Crazy Cloud
Peace,
PS. My dad told my mother that he has never killed anyone & I believe him.
Warriors don't have to kill to accomplish the mission.

  We are pleased to announce the publication of our
brand new web page

www.afromexico.org

This site's intention is to become an informative tool
based on discussion about the different aspects that
caracterize the African heritage in Mexico.

The core of this project consists in the realization
of a series of video documentaries that explore
different aspects of the african-mexican people. So
far the first two documentaries of the series have
been finished and published which are, "LA RAIZ
OLVIDADA" ( The Forgotten Root) and "DE FLORIDA A
COAHUILA". (From Florida to Coahuila)

Presently we are working on our third documentary
"CORRERIAS EN EL MONTE",(Incursions into the
Mountains) and we are seeking financial support in
order to finish the work in progress. We are raising
these funds in the form of co-production, sale of
rights of distribution and support from organizations
with the objective of promoting projects of cultural
caracter. Another way to support us is by buying our
documentaries which are available in a subtitled
version in English from our distributor in the US,
"Latin American Video Archives" www.lavavideo.org,

In Mexico the rol of Africans in the development of
the nation is not oficially recognized, and one of the
main goals of our project is to fight for that
recognition.
We hope that you have a chance to take a look at our
site, and if you can provide us with feedback that
will be most helpful for us. Please feel free to
forward this mail to anyone you consider might be
interested in our project. This would allow us to meet
our goals in a timely manner, goals which help, to
some extent, to the development of a culture of
tolerance and the vision of diversity as the main

Catherine Daly's writing runs the gamut from medieval collage to modern
epiphany, from a poem inspired by Piers Plowman to statements like "the
devil is filled with what other creatures aren't." Daly has published
two poetry collections: Locket, forthcoming in October from Tupelo
Press, and the trilogy DaDaDa, from SALT Publishing. She received an MFA
from Columbia University in 1991. An applications architect for fifteen
years, she created systems for Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, space shuttle
orbiter engineers, the U.S. Navy, SONY, and Universal. She created and
taught the first online poetry workshops at UCLA Extension?s Writers?
Program. She has made a great deal of her work available online (linked
at http://www.catherinedaly.info).


?Love consumes love?s beauty, incandescent,
alternating current
nothingness, absorbed into love, touched
seized, dominated, contained.? -Daly

?Who are these people, stranded behind the blockade? Courted by an
unsuitable suitor?? -Daly,
?Find a Penny?


Sommelier to Fallen Angels, Eileen Tabios is the author of the infamous
Poetry Blog, ?Chatelaine Poetics,? where refers to herself in the third
person as ?moi?: ?explaining why, despite moi best efforts, Moi totally
sucks at being a poetry diva. Here's the illuminating (for moi anyway)
excerpt?? She has written, edited or co-edited 12 books of poetry,
fiction and essays, most recently Behind The Blue Canvas (short stories)
and Menage A Trois With the 21st Century (poems). She is currently
working on Footnotes to The History of Fallen Angels:
Historians are
the amoral -- nay, immoral --
ones for lacking imagination.
For ignoring footnotes. For
reducing me to a convenient label:
Princess of Absinthe.

In 2005, she will release her next book, I Take Thee, English For My
Beloved (Marsh Hawk Press). She is the founding editor of Meritage
Press, a multidisciplinary literary and arts press based in St. Helena
and San Francisco.

Please give space for contradiction
don’t rush the judgment, let space think,
Don’t you see the shotgun behind the consciousness?
Background behind the mind of a youth spent in the dream
of an army? That left a family pondering the field of struggle,
mental passages are entranced by the masochistic images
of a childhood bereft of peace
more like pieces of a history I will spend a lifetime replacing
with the possibility of another way
I say on many days that mine is not a gun
though I am the son of it
the inherit fear in me is to die without the blessing
of a world whole & holy unto itself
the body praised before the mind
or the synthesis maybe
when we act as we are as good,
as opposed to what we want to be
my youth is full of itself & errs often
but let my faults be a coffin to bear pride to the sea
let me drown like a fish full in the water
let life pull all away as a supplication folding
hands clasped as patience
sometimes I want to be pulled back from my position
to speak, to be held rather
in the arms of an earth that will forever want me
& then I see my future in something
away I run, as if the revolution could be there
at that moment & the world be damned.

It has been said that the present age
                that lacks passion,
& the lull is preferred to the roar,
the polite is praised & the conflict of possibility
threatened with every turn

revolutionaries often become the madness
of a society bent on suppression
the urge consistent, the society with a standard as flat
as a remote controlled connection
Nymphomaniac lives gesticulated through the hypocrisy
of Christianity, we bask in condemnation
for another tribe & call a woman covered
so we strip naked & beat the life of our society, & call Afrikans black
our house of papier-mâché & glass
the homeland is secure against stones.

Did you see the sky today
or were you to busy trying
to paint it? Did you invent clever names
for the moonlight, or did you dance under it?

EAST OF EDEN
In the scene
in a field of lettuce while
saying hello to the people in the
trees, just as the difficulty
in philosophy,
not to interrupt
is to say no more
than we know. a child may believe the wind
as Wittgenstein says,
break through the screen and
is made by the leaves (of the
family going to the movies).
when I was a nipper and
beyond his bedroom window slow
illusion or a "suspension of disbelief"
I thought sure it was possible to take
action but just to pet their dog, c'mon
I'd rather that blackness, the
other side. I imagined myself doing this,
it wasn't a question of
what lives on the screen
we're being lived somewhere
the corduroy ape appears
admittedly, this was gratuitous
else, that they were another reality.
years later this effect of
"off in the distance" what must
talking to a Mexican girl
make the best writing
evocative? the mother is talking,
sick in bed, when suddenly
streams past behind her head.
of all times and realities taking place
parallel reality came rushing home
be a blue Mercury passing along
simmering as folk song.
an enormous blue ship like
her little boy, to her a lifetime
good art
possess this effect
right now,
that's what.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hi all,



I have a project of a networked performance that I thought might be of some

interest to some of you. It uses common bureaucratic-technological tools in a

playful and ambiguous way in order to create a rather undefinable artwork. I am

currently looking for a festival / artistic event within which this performance

could appropriately take place.



Find below the description of the project a short biography of me.





My project consists in several steps:



first, to accumulate via different e-mail addresses, e-letters subscriptions,

mailing-lists, digital networks, a consequent amount of junk-mail, more

accurately what is now called "spam-poetry", the accumulation of random words.

(process started one month ago)



second, to recycle this raw material in the form of a text file, then printed on

recycled paper and each page being stamped and autographed by the artist during

the period of the performance (24 hours).



third, to send by fax a copy of each unique artwork to the participants during

the period of the performance, each copy being asked for by previous e-mail

request during the same period of time to a temporary web-site.



fourth, to delete the original word files, and put back the original printed

stamped autographed paper sheets into the recycling networks of everyday life.



performance which is to be announced on the internet, and broadcasted through

a web-cam.



the only "real" artworks that remain are the received faxes/duplicatas by the

participants and a list-archive of the names / e-mail addresses for those

willing to do so.





Thus, I intend to use bureautic / bureaucratic hardware to create a temporary

community, to promote a re-cycling re-sampling economics, and to blur the

boundaries between garbage and "meaningful" content (artworks). My role as the

"Artist" is obviously ironic, both because of the repetitive nature of the work

and because of the undeserved emphasis put on the fact that each copy is stamped

and signed before being faxed, while I haven't written any of the words on the

sheets I will sign.



The aim is also to question the "originality" (as unicity) of an artwork, and

also to question the notion of veracity - authenticity of network-circulated

documents in the era of digital reproduction. Is the real artwork the text

stamped and autographed but thrown to the bin, the received fax copy, or the

performance itself?

I remember Borge's act.
But what this came from was hearing a Milosz poem, and wanting to quote from
it.
How do we quote correctly from the spoken word, without seeing the poem in
print?

Speaking of wind.
 Kerry and Bush were both in Portland on the same day. Kerry spoke to the
largest crowd of his campaign, over 55,000. Bush spoke to a carefully
selected group of mainly business people in a high school setting.
Later, Kerry wanted to go wind-surfing at Hood River, which he's before, but
there was no wind. Bush had already left town.

!!Concrete Cat Bitch

[http://www.spidertangle.net/liquidtext.com/ConcreteCatBitch.jpg]

Expect to see him turn on the concrete Cat Welfare Society. In those
situations nothing thorny to coax under the bed. Hurricane peeled away
as he combed wilderness of HONEYMOON paw print souls blasting squat
white flowers around the headstone of Flounder, a stray basement, where
there are impossible diseases accessible for valuable training
exercise; Before Time eventually quit drinking and started The Museum
of Attempted Suicide and a tangle of rusting pink concrete pig under
its salon.

An underused strip of "CAT-astrophe" pouring trickling salvageable and
"We're good Sphinx in turbulent times, of the Cat Theater of Chalk,
knowing what to lock in reflexes and the occasional Where's our black,
long-haired circus workers with some raw jungle dwarfed by the quiet
place. SECRECY BREEDS radical technology after wall collapses on Escape
eyesores. Another woman smashed Society of father's footsteps so stuff
washes off into the underground."

they sat alone after she left

and the dusk slowly turned to night

what did they speak of
loneliness curled its wisps around them
loneliness caressed them in the distance

Edited by Reb Livingston and Molly Arden, No Tell Motel features a new
poet each week, a new poem every weekday.   Each year will see the
publication of 52 poets and 260 poems. Featured poets in August and
September will be Jennifer Michael Hecht, Anthony Robinson, Karl
Parker, Heidi Lynn Staples, Shanna Compton and others.

Poems by poets young and not so young, broadly published and obscure
will be considered.  Any subject or style is acceptable.

Send no less than 5 poems and no more than 8. Poetry will be featured
on a daily basis throughout the week. Exceptions may be made for long
pieces.

Send submissions to submit@notellmotel.org  with "(YOUR LAST NAME
)_submission" in the subject line.  We only accept submissions via
e-mail.

Cut and paste your poems into the body of the e-mail message. Do not
send attached files. Poets requiring special formatting should query
for
instructions first.

Include a brief bio.

We do not consider previously published work.

Simultaneous submissions are acceptable only if we are informed
immediately if your work is accepted elsewhere.

We strive to respond to all submissions in a timely manner.  Expect
response time to be between  2- 6 weeks.   Do not inquire on the status
of your submission until after the 6th week.

In July of 2004, I invited readers of Third Factory / Notes to Poetry to
submit constellations of up to eleven titles that, taken together,
presented something of their current interests. While an emphasis on poetry
titles published after 2001 was encouraged, other items of literary,
cultural, and political interest were also welcomed. I am grateful to
everyone who made time to participate in this ongoing attempt to map the
shifting field of our singular and collective attentions.

        41 Contributors

        474 Mentions in all

        374 Separate titles mentioned

Participants: Ammiel Alcalay, Rae Armantrout, Bill Berkson, Anselm
Berrigan, Jules Boykoff, Pam Brown, Franklin Bruno, Joshua Clover, Chris
Daniels, Jordan Davis, Marcella Durand, kari edwards, Larry Fagin, Steve
Farmer, Graham W. Foust, Benjamin Friedlander, Heather Fuller, Alan

they are careless as they sing to you
tho they think they are carefree
before your birth
angels of a hell of a better place
angels  self-described
tho even they know not what they are
called
thus sing of the innocence of your pre-arrival
for they no not you'll arrive

this is still not your country
still born
not your life you are not living

the looks on all their faces
lie somewhere between
smile & amazement
telepathy & doubt
awe & that place of listening
where expression seems nameless
that place of singing
where words are quite useless

( insert )  scream as you know u scream as u know u scream
               as u dwell here scream as you dwell here scream as you
dwell here scream
               in a space untouched & untouching.....

the chorus holds you back
the horns build mighty walls

the composer holds you back   he holds you back
he holds you back

as if you'd never been here
as if you'd never been here

b.

after all i don't want this ending to be over
i can't begin where i've begun

i trance within the blinking of a blunken
i sind & soond i done begun  sun'son

c.  anti-social  tzimus...... (  be  havior  )

kill your brother
bring a friend

the way the other howls as the water flickers
the way the other whimpers as the light gurgles
the way the other laughs as the weather changes

& the favored of the house venture into echoes
& the shunned of the house enters into chaos

i said that too....   i said that too....

kill your brother
bring a friend

the way ice clatters after it leaves the sky.

I am writing very quickly & at this rate a book will be completed in a month
or 2... I am just cutting & pasting to the email... thanks for your time,

I see a sky painted with energy   the orgone
a ball of fire, a baptism of sorts   purged
on the edge of catharsis    these are final days of a kind
when the poem has been stripped of all possibility
to witness something more profound then a body
in motion, the universe dances in an interconnection
with a breath the path of the milky way expands into another system
and that system comes apart at the hinge
those stars contract as the beginning of a descent
into the orgasm
folds and folds again, a universe alive with explosions
implosions densities infinity compact
& bursts minutely powerful grass leaves that scatter a lawn
long shades of open fields half ripe with imagination
but in all this carefully,            designations
humanity has made a land barren from life
I laugh at the fly swatter & the mosquito net
I play by a cool drink of water     dangerous as the times
Iterating the reality of warfare,    the pure pollution of insanity
some don’t know how to leave the act
it carries them frail for the imperfection of existence
complaints vary but the complainer often finds company
whenever the bar tab is added up
& its time to split the bill 20 ways, I would rather
not exchange Caesar’s face for a hand full of rice
what is the price for your freedom? One could ask
but I see how in silence they already are jealous of the answer
for that hell is hell to be
will always happen in these isolated patterns
a monk of the moment, a hermit in a desolate green
perfect in its right angels its angular accounting of Abba
scores are gifted to see the ridiculousness of the test
a number cast into an infinity, I would rather be dumb to counting
my eyes pulled from out socket
my lips stained violet with the sweet taste of blueberries
nomads cursed to walk their bitterness
smiling perhaps but pained by the imposition of time
& its bastard child history
will I meet you again in this world, I imagine
that your face has been brought to my door 1,000 times before
your sentence read, the nails perfected
let my coffin be empty as yours let my hair gown a passage
faith is a two sided coin whose edge shakes like ebbs & flows
of an ocean whose command falls from the sky above
1 midnight their was a crescent moon below the northstar
as if the other side of planet was not as far as its sign.

PS. Bob Marley, "I love to pray."

A Co-presentation of Hallwalls, Squeaky Wheel and Just Buffalo

DROWNED OUT

Directed by Franny Armstrong (2002, 75 min., UK) Armstrong's documentary
presents audiences with the three choices faced by the people of Jalsindhi
in central India: move to the slums in the city, accept a place at a
resettlement site or stay at home and drown. They must make a decision fast.
In the next few weeks, their village will disappear underwater as the giant
Narmada Dam fills. Bestselling author Arundhati Roy joins the fight against
the dam and asks the difficult questions: Will the water go to poor farmers
or to rich industrialists? What happened to the 16 million people displaced
by fifty years of dam building? Why should I care?

A/S/L

A Video+Text Installation from India's Raqs Media Collective

A/S/L (Age/Sex/Location) is a video+text installation on the lives of women
workers in the online data outsourcing industry in India. The installation
is a meditation on this, new gendered geography of online labour, on the
everyday journeys into cyberspace that hundreds of thousands of labouring
women make across the world. It is a document and a dramatization of the
questions that surround these daily migrations between online and off-line
worlds. It addresses the viewer with video, text and sound within the
framework of an on site installation.

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and taverns!),
utilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented forms. We
will explore the structural possibilities of language to ultimately answer
the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning and practiced
poets will generate lots of original writing from this full day of language
play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye with which to
revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson Literary
Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the Arts, Mad
Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled notspeak.

Dear Readers of the Poetics List,

    It seems to me that John Kerry is not doing a good job in =
approaching the issues. I've written a letter to him, pasted below. =
Would any of you be interested in printing it, signing it, sending it to =
others, and mailing it to him by post mail? Also, do you know of other =
websites, political in nature, where one could post letters? Thank you =
-- Leslie



Kerry-Edwards 2004, Inc                              August 12, 2004

P.O. Box 34640

Washington, DC 20043

Dear Senator Kerry,

=20

                The public backing you wants you to directly challenge =
Bush's lies.

=20

                I've contributed several times to your campaign, as a =
contribution to help in your election and the defeat of George Bush. I =
think this country, and the world, will be in very desperate trouble =
even more than it is already if Bush is able to secure another term.=20

                I've talked with friends, all solidly behind you, and we =
are frightened by the effect of Bush's baiting and propaganda techniques =
against you. In the New York Times today I read the article, "For Now, =
Bush's Mocking Drowns Out Kerry's Nuanced Explanation of His War Vote". =
I respectfully wish to comment that in order to 'beat' this image =
applied to you of "flip-floppy" and "waffling," please we request take a =
chance and speak strongly in reply. Some basic answers, which you may be =
using but are not being heard clearly enough, were provided already by =
Rand Beers in that NYT article:

=20

Complaints about Bush: 1. Rushing to war. 2. Doing it without enough =
allies. 3. Doing it without equipping our troops adequately. 4. Doing it =
without an adequate plan to win the peace. 5. Going to war without =
examining the quality of Bush's intelligence.

=20

Bush's ineffective fight on terrorism: Please directly attack Rice et al =
for exposing the Pakastani mole in Al Qaida thus destroying the mole's =
effectiveness-which Rice et al revealed simply to make the Bush team =
look good and to justify Bush having used three-or-four-year-old =
intelligence information, their purpose being to frighten the American =
public to demonstrate the public should stick with Bush's war on =
terrorism. Bush would even like to have another terrorist attack in =
order to win the election. Why do anything to stop it?

=20

Other points that should be added to these are related to Rand Beers' =
initial five. Please consider, as you must have since he's worked on =
your team (I respectfully submit he would be a terrific head of the =
State Department), Ambassador Joseph Wilson, who has proved that Bush's =
administration was actually lying to draw the US into war. They knew =
they were lying about Niger selling uranium to Iraq, Rice, Cheney, the =
whole bunch knew. Please see, which you may have already done, Joseph =
Wilson's book, The Politics of Truth. The articles he wrote criticizing =
the Bush administration (on many issues) are placed at the end of the =
book.

=20

Additions:

6. Rushing to war by duping the American public with lies. Lies include =
knowledge that there were no weapons of mass destruction, that Niger did =
not sell uranium to Iraq, that Bush stated these as his basis for war =
but later claimed these were not the basis, he changed his tune, etc.=20

=20

7. Smearing people who have a valiant record, including yourself but =
also the example of Joseph Wilson who attempted to unveil these lies. =
Bush's tactics which are even illegal are similar to Watergate.

=20

8. As part of # 4 above might be added: the proliferation of terrorism, =
magnified by Bush's unjust violence in attacking a soverign nation which =
has not threatened us, actions which only convince its populace that we =
are invaders whose motives are profit. Please see Joseph Wilson's book =
on this.

=20

9. Strongly push examining the Bush relation to huge corporations like =
the oil companies and Bechtel, and other private contractors given huge =
profit in Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia. Please openly reference Michael =
Moore's film, Farenheit 9/11. It's an immensely popular, moving film =
where it has been allowed to be shown. Please emphasize that Bush's =
policies do not benefit the common people of America, nor are they =
welcomed by the common people of Afghanistan and Iraq whose countries =
have been destroyed, the promised reparations of which are beyond our =
means.

=20

10. Use of our soldiers as fodder while undercutting their benefits and =
pay and requiring added tours of duty. The facts on these matters have =
been gathered by Moveon.org . Our soldiers are left exposed to attack in =
Afghanistan and Iraq. The imprisoning and torture of Iraqi and Afghani =
citizens and soldiers in circumstances that are human rights violations. =
Left without legal recourse. This has been recently challenged: the =
whole system should be pinned on Bush's govt. These have been =
well-documented and serve to fundamentally refute Bush's claim that "We =
did the right thing, and the world is better off."

=20

11. The "God-issue". Apparently many people (including African =
Americans) are going to be single-issue voters, choosing Bush because of =
his religious advocacy. Is it possible to openly question his mistaken =
(even blasphemous in Christian religion) delusion that God is speaking =
to him directly, giving him a pass to go to war? I think you should =
challenge this directly citing it as egotism which is blasphemous: ask =
him about it-Where does he get off saying God speaks to him directly? =
Especially as his presentation of this is perceived in the Middle East =
as religious war against Islam, which is fostering terrorism.  Draw the =
American public into dialogue over this, inviting them to give their =
views.

=20

12. (foreign policy): apparently 30% of the Jewish vote in the US may go =
to Bush because they feel his policies are good for Israel, because he =
has backed Sharon thus retaining land for Israel. This view may include =
wanting Iraq to be in future civil war or broken up. Is there any way =
you can challenge that directly forcefully by pointing out that a sea of =
enemies in continued violence and suffering are a far greater danger to =
Israel in the future than peaceful, prosperous neighbors.=20

=20

13. Bush's corporation-serving policies on the environment. Please cite =
the issues listed on Robert Redford's Natural Resources Defense Council =
petition (40 West 20th Street, New York, NY 10011). Policies which do =
not favor labor. The national deficit. Etc.

=20

                I respectfully submit that your raising these issues =
with vigor, while it risks and ensures response, is necessary =
immediately- or you might lose. To grab these issues by the horns takes =
faith in the American public, that they can handle real treatment of =
issues-because they do care about these issues. They must be made to =
engage these issues by the way these are presented.=20

Emphasizing Bush's lies which are to delude and manipulate the =
public-and his blasphemy as egomania which creates the extra =
complications of a religious war-may propose a counter image (to your =
being one who is waffling) and may get him on the run.

=20

Thank you for opposing him. We are counting on you. We need you.=20

=20

Sincerely,                               =20

=20

                I've talked with friends, all solidly behind you, and we are
frightened by the effect of Bush's baiting and propaganda techniques against
you. In the New York Times today I read the article, "For Now, Bush's
Mocking Drowns Out Kerry's Nuanced Explanation of His War Vote". I
respectfully wish to comment that in order to 'beat' this image applied to
you of "flip-floppy" and "waffling," please we request take a chance and
speak strongly in reply. Some basic answers, which you may be using but are
not being heard clearly enough, were provided already by Rand Beers in that
NYT article:



Complaints about Bush: 1. Rushing to war. 2. Doing it without enough allies.
3. Doing it without equipping our troops adequately. 4. Doing it without an
adequate plan to win the peace. 5. Going to war without examining the
quality of Bush's intelligence.



Bush's ineffective fight on terrorism: Please directly attack Rice et al for
exposing the Pakastani mole in Al Qaida thus destroying the mole's
effectiveness-which Rice et al revealed simply to make the Bush team look
good and to justify Bush having used three-or-four-year-old intelligence
information, their purpose being to frighten the American public to
demonstrate the public should stick with Bush's war on terrorism. Bush would
even like to have another terrorist attack in order to win the election. Why
do anything to stop it?



Other points that should be added to these are related to Rand Beers'
initial five. Please consider, as you must have since he's worked on your
team (I respectfully submit he would be a terrific head of the State
Department), Ambassador Joseph Wilson, who has proved that Bush's
administration was actually lying to draw the US into war. They knew they
were lying about Niger selling uranium to Iraq, Rice, Cheney, the whole
bunch knew. Please see, which you may have already done, Joseph Wilson's
book, The Politics of Truth. The articles he wrote criticizing the Bush
administration (on many issues) are placed at the end of the book.



Additions:

6. Rushing to war by duping the American public with lies. Lies include
knowledge that there were no weapons of mass destruction, that Niger did not
sell uranium to Iraq, that Bush stated these as his basis for war but later
claimed these were not the basis, he changed his tune, etc.



7. Smearing people who have a valiant record, including yourself but also
the example of Joseph Wilson who attempted to unveil these lies. Bush's
tactics which are even illegal are similar to Watergate.



8. As part of # 4 above might be added: the proliferation of terrorism,
magnified by Bush's unjust violence in attacking a soverign nation which has
not threatened us, actions which only convince its populace that we are
invaders whose motives are profit. Please see Joseph Wilson's book on this.



9. Strongly push examining the Bush relation to huge corporations like the
oil companies and Bechtel, and other private contractors given huge profit
in Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia. Please openly reference Michael Moore's film,
Farenheit 9/11. It's an immensely popular, moving film where it has been
allowed to be shown. Please emphasize that Bush's policies do not benefit
the common people of America, nor are they welcomed by the common people of
Afghanistan and Iraq whose countries have been destroyed, the promised
reparations of which are beyond our means.



10. Use of our soldiers as fodder while undercutting their benefits and pay
and requiring added tours of duty. The facts on these matters have been
gathered by Moveon.org . Our soldiers are left exposed to attack in
Afghanistan and Iraq. The imprisoning and torture of Iraqi and Afghani
citizens and soldiers in circumstances that are human rights violations.
Left without legal recourse. This has been recently challenged: the whole
system should be pinned on Bush's govt. These have been well-documented and
serve to fundamentally refute Bush's claim that "We did the right thing, and
the world is better off."



11. The "God-issue". Apparently many people (including African Americans)
are going to be single-issue voters, choosing Bush because of his religious
advocacy. Is it possible to openly question his mistaken (even blasphemous
in Christian religion) delusion that God is speaking to him directly, giving
him a pass to go to war? I think you should challenge this directly citing
it as egotism which is blasphemous: ask him about it-Where does he get off
saying God speaks to him directly? Especially as his presentation of this is
perceived in the Middle East as religious war against Islam, which is
fostering terrorism.  Draw the American public into dialogue over this,
inviting them to give their views.



12. (foreign policy): apparently 30% of the Jewish vote in the US may go to
Bush because they feel his policies are good for Israel, because he has
backed Sharon thus retaining land for Israel. This view may include wanting
Iraq to be in future civil war or broken up. Is there any way you can
challenge that directly forcefully by pointing out that a sea of enemies in
continued violence and suffering are a far greater danger to Israel in the
future than peaceful, prosperous neighbors.



13. Bush's corporation-serving policies on the environment. Please cite the
issues listed on Robert Redford's Natural Resources Defense Council petition
(40 West 20th Street, New York, NY 10011). Policies which do not favor
labor. The national deficit. Etc.



                I respectfully submit that your raising these issues with
vigor, while it risks and ensures response, is necessary immediately- or you
might lose. To grab these issues by the horns takes faith in the American
public, that they can handle real treatment of issues-because they do care
about these issues. They must be made to engage these issues by the way
these are presented.

Emphasizing Bush's lies which are to delude and manipulate the public-and
his blasphemy as egomania which creates the extra complications of a
religious war-may propose a counter image (to your being one who is
waffling) and may get him on the run.



Thank you for opposing him. We are counting on you. We need you.



Sincerely,



Written by Leslie Scalapino, 5729 Clover Drive, Oakland CA 94618

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

Dear Poetics List Readers:

I am selling weird stuff (knitted hats, Republican National Convention anti-Bush t-shirts, CDs, etc.) at the following website: www.angelfire.com/poetry/lisajarnot/factory.html.  (I've decided that being an adjunct professor is boring, so I want to start into a new line of work as a factory manager.)

I also now have a blog at www.angelfire.com/poetry/lisajarnot/blog.  I'll be including information updates re: protests in NYC over the next couple of weeks.

All best,
Lisa Jarnot

I think the Tzara quote was closer to "Thought is made in the mouth."

The cite -- Googling "tzara thought mouth" brings us this quotes
website, <http://www.poemhunter.com/tristan-tzara/quotations/poet-35098/page-1/>
-- might be: "Dada Manifesto on Feeble Love and Bitter Love," sct. 4,
La Vie des Lettres, no. 4 (Paris, 1921).

Googling on that title brings us perhaps the full text of that manifeso here:
http://www.391.org/manifestos/tristantzara_dmonflabl.htm

Looks right but authenticity (this is the web, after all) not guaranteed.

Hi All! I'm facilitating an on-line poetry environment, "The Living Changes:
Sophomore and Advanced Poetry Workshop", for Syracuse University this fall. In
case you might be interested in participating, here's a quote from the
syllabus:

"This course is intended to help you engage more fully with your own poetry
and your writing process by writing your own poetry, responding to the efforts
of others in your writing community, and emulating the practices of other
writers. The course focuses on innovation in the language arts, with the
intention that your range as a writer and your sense of artistic possibility
will expand. Plus, it's meant to be fun.

We will read and study a range of compositional methods and styles that
privilege writing as an experience and process, and we will engage an active
and creative writing life. Reading is essential to an artist's development,
and for this reason, we will read and discuss a book by several living
authors."

Folks seem to really enjoy the course, get a lot of writing done, and often
develop signficantly. We'll respond to the following texts, as well as
spend time reading and discussing the online poetry and poetics worlds:

Ron Padgett, The Teachers and Writers Handbook of Poetic Form
David Lehman, The Evening Sun
Joe Wenderoth, Letters to Wendy's
Eric Baus, The To Sound
Lee Ann Brown, The Sleep that Changed Everything
Loren Goodman, Famous Americans
Harryette Mullen, Sleeping with the Dictionary
James Wagner, False Sun Recordings

Anytime is the time to write again.
--Gertrude Stein

If you're interested in taking the course, please feel free to back-channel me
with any questions.

Chrs,
Heidi

of the wonder


we should say this repeatedly: we love the net. it has grown unbelievably
over the past decade - what we take for granted today, could never have
occurred even fifty years ago.to be able to communicate world-wide and in
close to real-time - with all the faults and impoverishments - and to be
able to communicate within and without warzones. to be able to see someone
continents away, to be able to smile in awe at the presence of webcams
bringing the surface of the planet closer and perhaps more understandable.
the faults are endless, and we're all aware of them, to the extent that
our usual approach is a barrage of practical and theoretical critique. but
we should never forget what still appears as a miracle, a kind of
electronic alterity reaching almost to the stars, quietly bringing with it
new modes of communities, languages, genders, gatherings, and both saying
and speaking. we wake up every day to this, and we must remind ourselves,
constantly, of the beauty of this world, these worlds. otherwise we will
be lost forever. open your eyes wide to the net, love the new and still
fresh membrane of our lives. speak in whispers, speak in awe.

I believe the original post included a request for citation.  In case no one
has provided this thus far, "Thought is made in the mouth" comes from Tzara's
Dada Manifesto On Feeble Love and Bitter Love, section four.  The context is
as follows:  "Must we no longer believe in words?  Since when do they express
the contrary of what the organ that utters them thinks and wants?  Herein lies
the great secret:  Thought is made in the mouth."

Tzara is clearly positing a natural, organic nexus between language and
biology, with the  biological "self" the privileged force.  On the other hand,
Tzara's Cartesian tendencies lead him to doubt everything ("DADA places before
action, and above all:  Doubt.")

DADA is not quite in line with current ideas of language's/culture's
creation/control/direction of the self.  It also resists communal/collective thinking
and action.  For example, Tzara writes that "The person who steals -- without
thinking of his own interests, or of his will -- elements of his individual,
is a kleptomaniac.  He steals himself.  He causes the characters that alienate
him from the community to disappear.  The bourgeois resemble one another . . .
.  They are all very poor."  Best, Bill

Subject:      Working Hypothesis on the orgone
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

This hypothesis recently crystallized, so I figured I would toss it into the
waters... here goes

1) Wilhem Reich developed his conceptualization of the orgasm by negating
the possibility of sublimation. His thesis was that concept of  sublimation
(as presented in Western Christianity) was only another for of sexual
repression. My major contention is that eastern practices (with a focus on
yoga) in fact present a clear form of physical, not intellectual,
sublimation. Even breathing/ meditation practices (combined with the
importance of posture) could be in the same realm of physical sublimation. I
recently read that yoga roughly translates as union, or a union with life
energy. My hypothesis being that yoga releases the same orgone energy as an
orgasm, unifying what Reich referred to as the pysche/ soma split, or a
moment of harmony. For any more information on this last part, PLEASE READ
Wilhem Reich. I would argue that what I have defined as physical sublimation
does not destroy or eliminate the human biological drive. Instead, it would
release energy that would otherwise cause neurosis, in other words it would
eliminate the prescence of a sexual stasis (using the language of Reich).

2) Reich's body armoring is in fact the exact same as the yoga principle of
chakras (I apologize if the spelling is incorrect). Furthermore, in both
Reich's conceptualization of the human body & in all the spiritual
derivatives of a basic yogi root, the body is centered on the pelvis region
(the lowest chakra). This region is often given the signifier of the 1
Thousand Petal lotus. For Reich is was more a matter of biological
necessity, but two sources seem to come to the exact same conclusion.

Please refute...

NY ACTION ALERT * UNITED FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE
http://www.unitedforpeace.org | 212-868-5545
============================================
GET UPDATES ON THE LAWSUIT + MORE AT OUR MEETING TONIGHT
Wednesday, August 18 at 6:30PM
Washington Square Methodist Church
135 W. 4th St., between 6th Ave. and Washington Square Park
============================================

Rallying in Central Park is a right, not a privilege! United for Peace
and Justice filed a lawsuit today in New York State Supreme Court over
New York City's denial of the use of Central Park for a rally on
August 29, after our legal, permitted march past Madison Square
Garden. We are seeking a court order to allow the rally to proceed.

The lawsuit - UFPJ vs. New York City Mayor Bloomberg, Parks
Commissioner Adrian Benepe, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and the
City of New York - asserts that Central Park has traditionally served
as a forum for free expression, and that by denying us its use, New
York City is violating our Constitutional rights to free assembly. To
learn more about the lawsuit and get updates on other aspects of the
organizing for August 29, please come to our final citywide mobilizing
meeting at 6:30PM tonight, August 18, at Washington Square Methodist
Church, 135 West 4th Street.

The filing of this lawsuit means that we probably will not know the
final destination for our march until the very last minute. (Our
assembly time and location remain unchanged: Gather at 10:00AM at
Seventh Avenue and 14th Street, for a march beginning at noon.)

We've faced this situation before: It was just days before our massive
February 15, 2003 antiwar protest that we were able to announce the
details for our event. Then, too, Mayor Bloomberg hoped that the
uncertainty would keep people away, but he failed miserably: Hundreds
of thousands of you showed up for one of the largest protests in New
York City's history.

The best way for us to counter the City's efforts to stifle our
protest is to do everything we can in these next ten days to ensure
the largest, broadest possible turnout on August 29, when we will
march past the site of the Republican Convention to call for an end to
the divisive and destructive policies of the Bush Administration.

Make sure all your family members, friends, and coworkers know that
our legal, permitted march is going forward, no matter what happens in
court.

Make sure they know that - whatever the tabloids and the TV news might
say - we are committed to a peaceful protest, one that kids, seniors,
immigrants, and people with disabilities can attend, and that we will
march in a spirit of nonviolence.

Make sure they tell their friends about the protest, and that they
join us at 10:00AM on Sunday, August at Seventh Avenue and 14th
Street, to send a message so loud it cannot be ignored: We're sick of
the lies, sick of the greed, sickened by the war and the hate, and we
want a change.

In solidarity,
United for Peace and Justice

Interview with Ayana Vellissia Jackson and Marcos Villalobos on El Negro Mas
Chulo: African by Legacy, Mexican by Birth

by Christina Violeta Jones
MUNDO AFROLATINO
http://www.mundoafrolatino.com/english/articleA.htm

Based on existing historical and personal field research, El Negro Mas
Chulo: African by Legacy, Mexican by Birth is a photographic exhibit that
addresses Afro-Mexicans living on the Pacific and Gulf Coasts of Mexico.
Through fictionalized letters based on oral, visual, and historical
accounts, El Negro Mas Chulo traces the shaping of contemporary Afro-Mexican
roots while exposing this under recognized segment of the Diaspora.

The fictional letters featured in the exhibit are written in the voice of
Gaspar Nyanga addressed to a contemporary African American woman living in
North America.  Images accompanied with the text were photographed in the
town of Yanga, as well as in parts of Guerrero and Oaxaca, located on the
Pacific Coast of Mexico.

The project was created by photographer, Ayana Vellissia Jackson and writer,
Marcos Villalobos. Ms. Jackson is a graduate of Spelman College.  Her past
work has been featured in Fader magazine and Russell Simmon's One World
magazine.  Her photography in El Negro Mas Chulo celebrates the culture of
Afro-Mexicans while Mr. Villalobos's poetic phrases narrates the African
history.

MundoAfrolatino.com caught up with Ms. Jackson (AVJ) and Mr. Villalobos (MV)
to discuss art, writing, and El Negro Mas Chulo.


Christina (CV): Where were you from?

AVJ- Naughty-ville E.O -- East Orange, NJ

MV- I m from Woodlandia, Califas, between a soccer field and a cornfield,
north of a sugar mill, south of a tomato cannery, from the crossroads that
connects farm owners to farm workers, a little spot in the Sacramento valley
whose population was mostly Anglo and Mexican while I was growing up. At the
moment I live in Brooklyn, NY, where I¹ve been for about nine years now.

CV: How did you get interested in Latin American and Caribbean history and
culture, specifically with the African Diaspora communities in these
countries?

AVJ- One night or rather early one morning, my mother woke me up, told me to
get dressed and pack my bag, "we are going to Madrid". I don't think this
was my first trip abroad, but it was certainly the first I remember. I had
to be like 6 or 8. I remember because when I went to bed I had no idea I was
leaving the country on a red eye the next morning. I honestly don't remember
much else from that trip other than not understanding what people were
saying and the strong smell of armpit funk. But it was the language that
stuck with me. I'm nosy and I stare (that is probably the beginning and end
of my story). I wanna know. So I decided I needed to learn Spanish. That's
part one. Part two is that at least 75% of all my crushes throughout high
school were on Latin men... Ecuadoriano, Puertoriqueno, Xicano, Dominicano,
Peruano. I had it bad. I remember one of my first boyfriends (we actually
only dated over the phone and in the hallway at school. I wasn't allowed to
go out with guys) was Peruvian and his mom didn't speak English. I was
furious that I couldn't communicate with her (when you're dating over the
phone, telephone messages are really important). Part three is my father's
Universal Language West African Music and Dance Ensemble. In addition to his
work in Jazz, he toured the east coast visiting high schools and community
centers with his band. They played music from West Africa and the Diaspora,
that's where I first heard the word. That is also where I first learned that
as an African in the US, I had something in common with my Latino cousins. I
learned early on that the only difference between them and me was the
language of the words written on the slave ship. So with those three factors
as my teachers throughout my adolescence and teenage years, I came to this
interest naturally. It's part of who I understand myself to be.

MV- Being Xicano in northern California s agricultural based economy of the
early seventies is something as special and educational as being a Guajiro
in the Cuban revolution, or being an African American in Panther era
Oakland: you re born into a period of time when people around you are fed up
of taking shorts. So, change becomes part of who you are. Not to
romanticize, but I feel like I grew up in the middle of Latin America, and
my hometown is in a geographic area that many would consider beyond the
margins of Latin America proper. For me, however, the radical arts of
Lowriding for example, is a form of identity preservation and evolution that
parallels certain elements of Black Nationalism, Pan-Americanism, and the
very perseverance that is the African experience where Diaspora is
concerned. As a living breathing bleeding person in the 21st century, I don
t particularly feel tied down to identity in such a way that I wouldn¹t be
interested in the universal struggle of any particular Diasporic community,
especially those that surround me.

CV: What made you interested in using Latin American and Caribbean history
and culture in your work?

AVJ- I mentioned earlier that my Sociology thesis was on Race relations in
Latin America and the Caribbean. After experiencing two different Latin
America's during my junior year abroad, I realized I could not approach or
even discuss race relations in the Dominican Republic and Argentina using
the same assumptions. I decided to partition the region into Afro-Latin,
Euro-Latin, and Mestizo Latin America. It was during this study that I
discovered that there are still Afro-Mexican communities in Mexico. This was
in 1994. It blew my mind. Afro-Mexicans? Who ever heard of such a thing?
Unfortunately there is very little historical information on them. But
anyway, after I graduated, I moved to Miami where I had lots of fun with my
Cuban brethren. I maintained my interest, but research went on pause. It
took a few years for me to get things together. I knew I had an academic
interest but I was also developing this art. I went through a lot of stress
and turmoil to get to the point where I could say that my goal as a
photographer is to master the use of the camera as a sociological tool. This
has caused me much trouble in the New York art scene. I went for a meeting
with the Bronx Museum, I was being considered for their Artists in the
Marketplace Program for emerging artists. During my interview I was asked,
³at what point does your work leave documentary and become fine art²? Huh?
What kind of question is that? To this day I wonder? I don t know, why does
it matter? At the end of the day all fine art serves is as a documentation
of an era and a people. But this is my problem with the art scene. Folks are
caught up in language, tradition and nonsense. Of ultimate importance is how
my audience can grow by experiencing my work. Anyway and on one side I am
completely self taught, figuring it out as I go along, pretty ignorant to
the rules and history of fine art and crazy irritated by work with no
intellectual purpose. I¹m all for self expression, but I believe in taking
people from one place to another, not just deeper into me or what I think is
elegant. On the other hand, I have this cannon of dead white men in my brain
along with their really restrictive and boring means for communicating ideas
and observing our society. So I finally decided I could get my point across
by using the methodology of one medium and the tools of the other.

It wasn't until I moved to NY and met Marco that Latin America and the
Caribbean became a theme in my projects.

MV- Well, I will say that living in Gringolandia almost forces one into
salvaging what we can of history. And this goes back to the question about
how traveling effects creativity. On recent trips to Mexico, I was blessed
to learn of certain historical events that screamed to be retold-- I m
talking here about cultural crossroads, shared history between Americans of
varying complexion, and not a shared history that pits one group against
another, but the unspoken history that tells a truthful story, but also a
humane story. I¹m interested in using culture to unite populations rather
than simply distinguish one from the other. I m interested in giving proper
respect to varying cultures and then highlighting the point at which those
cultures become a progressive exchange. Let s face it, we¹ve known for
sometime now that history s been in desperate need of some balancing;
addressing that issue by letting culture work through you is really the most
personal and honest way there is.

CV: How did you meet your partner, Marco Villalobos, who collaborated with
you on this project?

AVJ- Marco and I met at an "industry" party in New York. He was writing for
a magazine I was interested in shooting for. A mutual friend introduced us
and I was given a heads up on this crazy insane article he wrote about
California low-rider culture. We became friends almost immediately. El Negro
Mas Chulo came out of one of our first conversations. I asked him if he knew
anything about the Afro-Mexicans, he mentioned an aunt of his who he always
suspected was part Black. A year and a half later we were on our way to
Guerrero.

MV- This is funny & Mutual friends introduced Ayana and I at an industry
showcase one night. At the time, I had a lot on my mind so I sort of blew
off the initial encounter and only went through the motions of a handshake
and a hello, nice to meet you. But about half an hour later Ayana approached
me to talk, and I, having not really paid attention when I met her, mistook
her for a completely different girl who I thought was cute. Basically, I
thought Ayana was this girl with whom I had a history and who I hadnŒt seen
in some time, so I thought she was trying to kick game. I was like, bring
it! But after about a minute, I realized that I had no idea at all who this
person was, so I got my head together real quick and we went from there. Of
course, Ayana may have an altogether different story-- and that s what I m
talking about when I say that history needs balance.

CV: Why did you decide to name the exhibition, El Negro Mas Chulo?

AVJ- Ah man, Lupita. Padre Glynn, a priest in El Ciruelo suggested that we
stay with one of the families in his Parish. He has been doing a tremendous
amount of work with the Afro-Mexican community, including an annual
Encuentros de los Negros. We had come to interview him and visit some of the
surrounding towns.

I must start by saying Marco and young children are like peas in a pod. All
I know is I come out onto the porch one afternoon and he's got little Lupita
reciting this poem, stopping, starting, giggling falling out and starting
over. It went on for over an hour. First she'd sing a song then he'd play it
back, and then she'd do another. In the end, El Negro Mas Chulo became the
title because (in my opinion) it was one of the few affirming tales of
Afro-Mexican existence. It confronts racism and boasts unwavering pride in
Blackness. We thought it was appropriate.

MV- The project title comes from a poem that a seven-year-old girl and her
tenyear old brother in el Ciruelo, Oaxaca, recited to us. I used a minidisc
recorder to conduct interviews and one day I was playing around with these
kids whose mother had taken us in for an evening. One of the kids, a real
cool little girl named Lupita began to sing into the mic and eventually she
came out with this poem that starts off: ŒYo soy El Negro Mas Chulo que ha
parida de esta region¹. You know, coming from the Hip Hop generation of the
States, something like that just sounds so nice out of a seven year old s
mouth. It s like a brag or a boast, you know‹ŒYo soy el negro mas chulo¹, I
m the flyest black man to come outta this whole area, boom! Ayana and I sort
of looked at each other and our jaws dropped. I was like, do it again, do it
again! We mustŒve recorded Lupita reciting the piece five times. But it Œs a
long poem, so sheŒd stop in the middle and forget the words. It was
hilarious. Lupita would start off so enthusiastically and then forget the
way. Eventually her older brother did the straight up command performance
version-- complete reclamador style. I mean, besides the poemŒs sharp
cadence, the opening sentence alone completely inverts racial stratification
and testifies to a very organic pride in self and culture. So, when it came
time to name the project, we felt as though the project had already been
given its name. The original poem is called El Negro Chulo, and it s by Abel
E. Baños Delgado who was also born in the state of Oaxaca.

CV: How was your experience in Mexico while you were there taking pictures
for this project?

AVJ- Amazing! All we knew going into the project was that Vera Cruz was a
major slave port and that there was a museum dedicated to Afro-Mestizaje in
Cuaji. The plan was to get on a bus and start asking questions. I remember
being excited as we boarded in Mexico City, because I saw an older woman
waiting to board a different bus. She had an almond complexion and tightly
curled silver hair. She was sitting peacefully on her bags of goods. The
sight of her gave me butterflies (it is one thing to read about something
and quite another to look it in the face). I asked Marco to ask her where
she was from (I was suddenly bashful). He introduced himself, they chatted
for a while. She smiled up at him and told him a few places to visit. He
gets back on the bus. I ask if I should take her picture. He says of course
. So I climb off the bus, introduce myself, tell her about the project and
ask to take her portrait. She -- just like almost everyone featured--
laughed at me then gave her consent. We wished each other well and went our
separate ways. Eight hours later the sound of little girls talking wakes me
up. I open my eyes and see two little brown faces with loose curls carrying
packages of food and cartons of juice up and down the isle. It was 7:00 or
so in the morning. We had arrived in Cuaji. I will never forget the moment I
stepped off the bus. Leaning up against a pillar in the parking lot were two
men in conversation. They smiled at me as they continued to talk. I couldn't
stop staring at their hair, their skin, their noses, lips, eyes and facial
hair. I thought I was looking at people in my own family. And everywhere I
looked for the next three weeks I saw nothing but black skin. I must say
again, it is one thing to read about something and quite another to
experience it. Marco and I had to constantly remind ourselves that we were
in Mexico, because after a while it felt like quite a different place.

Once I got over the shock of getting what I came for, the butterflies came
back. "How exactly am I going to walk up to people and ask to photograph
them just because they have black skin"? I remember walking out of my hotel
room with my camera in my purse and sitting down on a curb a few yards later
trying to figure out how I was going to do this without objectifying these
people and committing the same crime as many a photojournalist working for
National Geographic. How can I be respectful? I must have sat there for an
hour and smoked half a pack of cigarettes. It is one thing to conceive and
another to execute. I put out my last cigarette and decided to trust my
intent, my sensibilities and myself. After that everything opened up. I must
say it is wonderful to have had Marco there. The oral history, the personal
interviews and conversations made a big difference in subsiding my initial
worries as well as in relaxing those I was photographing. In the end I
believe the viewer is looking at a whole being with an incredible legacy,
not just black skin over bones.

MV- The experience was dope! To start off, our flight from Brooklyn was
delayed because of the northeastern region s blackout, which occurred the
day we were scheduled to fly to Mexico. Ultimately though it was
appropriate, because we were about to go on this mission to investigate
blackness and on the day of the flight a very symbolic form of blackness
embraced us.

Once we got to Mexico everyone was very helpful, giving us books and
referring us to the work of experts on the subject. People told us what
towns to visit and everyone that we spoke to referred us to another set of
folks to talk to. For the most part, people were real open and warm and
inquisitive and supportive. The whole experience was so informative on
multiple levels that the project, though we¹ve honed it down to some
essential elements, still has a lot of unrefined potential. WeŒre ready to
go back and keep it moving.

CV: What other projects do you have in mind for the future?

AVJ- For me it's all one long project. Non-territorial nation-state --maroon
colonies, Ghanaian Hip Hop, Cuban Hip Hop -- these young people are a part
of the Hip Hop nation which I consider a modern day maroon colony made up of
people all over the world who live hip hop culture daily; Afro-punk -
anarchists people of color, maroons. The story of Yanga and the
Afro-Mexicans who are descendants of a colony of self liberated Africans is
just an early instance of the maroon spirit that is alive in all conscious
people of the world. So it's all the same thing to me. It's documenting
instances of self liberation and self definition among peoples of the
Diaspora.

I will mention, that I will be going to Berlin this summer to study as a
guest student at the University of Art, Berlin. There I will be documenting
the Turkish Hip Hop scene as an addition to the work I've been doing on the
Hip Hop non-territorial nation-state.

MV- Good things are coming. Ayana is working it out with the camera. She s
got other areas of the African Diaspora that she s focusing on. Plus, she s
very dedicated to documenting music scenes that involve underrepresented
communities. As for me, IŒm banging out my first novel, writing more poems,
and looking forward to collaborating with a homeboy of mine on a movie
project. Everything s on bubble. As a priority though, we re concentrating
on taking this project to as many people that we can, especially in places
like schools and cultural centers.

CV: What advice would you give for other young aspiring artists such as
yourself?

AVJ- GOYA - Get Off Your Ass! That's really all I can say. Contribute by any
mean necessary. Keep it moving!

MV- The only advice I could give is the obvious: read! Read a lot, and read
out loud so you can hear the music. Think about what makes you happy and
write about that. Write when you get mad. Write and write and read and write
and rewrite and remember that you have an audience that starts with you.

I can't for the life of me understand what body armoring (which isn't the
infamous box, it's something you do with your muscles if you haven't had
enough Reichian analysis) has to do with chakras. I understand even less
why anyone would want to conflate yoga and any kind of analysis. Are we
dealing with a Joseph Campbellian exercise, designed to demonstrate the
sameness of all things? And an exercise that requires belief in the orgone.
Oh my.

Of murder and a friend ...

Peace,

I am reminded

Of murder and a friend shot through the head behind a police station

I am reminded of Anthany James Dawson pounded into a coma on the streets
of Victoria by police officers

I am reminded

Of the self lynched black and Native youth sentenced to death by the
callousness and mental pimpin of this city… cuz they consume native and
black boys

I am reminded;

"keep a cool head" as the song by marcus Garvey goes.

I am reminded;

“I recall that my great master the late Grand Ayatollah (Hossein)
Boroujerdi once said: “I am a different man every day.” This statement
expresses an important point: that no one can claim to have access to
the absolute truth, and that everyone should always strive to correct
one's positions and views in the direction of the superior truth. Yet,
what one has achieved as a result of one's sincere efforts at any given
time can be taken as evidence of truth, and one should adhere to it
until one has reached a superior truth, or has discovered one's own
error.”-- Ayatollah Hossein ‘Ali Montazeri

...and dig the samizdat

Islam as dissidents and antipoverty revolutionaries -- a Muslim as a
revolutionary one step forward from Sandinista

I'm noticing more bullying, more propaganda -- the propaganda of hate
and self deception coming out of my town; even within the artist
community and the left (which has never really been open minded – simply
pretentious in it’s blue haired decadence – it’s post modernist fascism
= hacks) -- all are afraid of the powers they posed to be against or are
have fallen inline with them for profit -- and the ignorance which they
hid behind, with their middle class political correctness, is showing
itself to full effect.

the trend is to find a moral high ground to hide behind to express your
hate for the samo people you've always oppressed -- niggers, natives and
sand niggers. It transforms into the metaphor of invasion -- invasions
of noble peoples, the psychic, the emotional and physicals assaults of
those who dissent, be they overseas or across the street. The treachery
has come to the point of hiding your odi(N)um behind a cause celeb – the
defense of white wimmyn hood (kinda like the south during the civil
war), the gayousie gated community and crime … reaganomic and mulronyISM
in hemp funKAY gear with a alternative twist.

it seems that the left only concerns itself now with white rich
homosexuals, pagans, the business community and their security forces.

on the anniversary of Anthany James Dawson's murder by the VDP all that
our "HEP" weekly "Monday Mag" (now a Provada for the city and the thugz)
would concern the citizens with is the DIStraction of cellulite around
the city and why gay men have a bad body image.

Our so called left remained silent …yes…we had to hear of the struggles
of white folk -- an amerikkkan vegan looking for imported food in prison
and old middle class caucasoid woman claiming native land for the
neocolonist – the environmentalist.


“All they’re doin is telling us black kids and everybody that’s minorities
that our life isn’t worth anything”
-- Fun da Mentalz -- Seize The Time


Nada on the issues

next issue following, our false journalist rage another siege on the The
Hood/Fernwood/New Palestine (for a second time). Fernwood is one of the
hoods in this town of vcitoria, bc, with the most nonwhites, especailly
young and growing urban Native community – something not liked by even
the left = ‘why can’ they state on the reservation’. The only voices
heard from folk are the white and the middle class. The supremacist
propaganda is aimed at the section of New Palestine with the most the
Natives and poor. The solution offered is not a 10 Point Program,
following in the foots steps of the noble Black Panthers – no we don’t
make heroes or role models or even listen to nonwhite people—we destroy
them and get them to lynch themselves = less messy no evidence. We build
to destroy by constructing juvi halls and more prisons)…

NO!!!

We a call for more policing in a largely native and poor area – what a
slap in the face to the memory of Gerald kaboni, Jeff Berg, Ian Hunter,
Anthany Griffith and Anthany Dawson… the problem with Fernwood are not
the Natives, the poor and the nonwhites = drugs, drug dealers = redzoned
(banded from downtown) = the poor = drugs addicts and drug dealers and
junkies and nonwhites B.U.T. the influx of white supremacist, racist
renting policies -- the bigots who are looking for an alternative gated
community = police and thieves

…oh yeah.

could this be more of an excuse for the gentrification and clean up of
New Palestine for the wealthy and the south Africans with stolen booty?
The yuppies looking for a homes away from the east with their darkies?
and for the yuppies’ cool kids looking for pads away from mom and dad?
Or on their way to the rich and paled up semi-education centre of UVIC

...let's not forget the olympics – and the city's rococo abomination of
crackedout fibreglass whales infesting every block and corner replacing
the homeless who once stood there with no shelter, food or caring.

"Like dogs living in a household, natives are literally given scraps
from the tables of their conquering masters. A few hundred thousand
dollars are given to the natives in order to make them a dependent race
with no future ambitions of independent Statehood. From the perspective
of the master, it would be unthinkable for a dog to rise up and reclaim
its lands and dignity in the form of Statehood. The pet dog has been
conditioned to be content with his doghouse, meagre scraps, and its
master’s rules. It would be an understatement to say that dogs are
treated more humanely than aboriginals in their
doghouse-reservation-like existence."
--Alden C. Mayfield -- Cowboys and Indians: Perspectives on Patterns of
U.S. and Israeli Colonization

victoria as a bad amerikkka = kkklans men and aryans in che t-shirts
colonizing the occupied terrorities of a once native island.

The magazine, has(cks), like our left, become an advert/propaganda for
urban planning. Alas, garnering the cause of gentrification in New
Palestine, as well as, for the entire city, which has become a cloned
wasteland of the dying yuppy gay berg of what was once san francisco.


people seem to be afraid to stand up for anything or anyone or cause
which the powers have declared to be an enemy of the state....i guess
all the vacations to the civilized gated communities of so caL (southern
cali) has left our left with a taste for life in the suburbs without
niggers, native, sandniggers and the poor.

the failure of the poser west’s left/anarchist, with photocopier access,
has left the Che rockin combat cool kids, racist white bwais in dreds
and aging Hippicrits in shame cuz they chose, not exile or revolution or
even guaranteed income, B.U.T. static quo - the compliance with the
state, as did the german peoples with the nazis during the hitler regime
or the white citizenry in amerikkka, as blacks were beaten to death and
lynched as did those who ghettoize and killed the Irish, as are the
haitians colonized and captured by kkkanada and west, as did the anglo
blokes when the french, in quebec, were beaten and left in ghettos for
not speaking english, as our Iraqi bredden and sistren are attacked
today yet they form human shields against oppression. as are the
palestinians left to be exterminated by the riechstag of israel, the
U.S.less, ukkk and their all LIES.

Most people just watched, turned a blind, joined up, denied everything
later or bragged of disgust they never felt in their safety:

So, in that tradition of fear, in the tradition of those who signed
loyalty contracts and gave up names of comrades to the HUAC during the
50’s, in favour of surrendering their talents and their career to
mediocrity and white 50's comatose existence, our left pose and suck
back coffee in their white folk only cliques of activist impotence,
burying their heads in the sand or up the posteriors of sagging nudity,
found in photo spreads disrespecting women, as they transform and
transendanger radicalism with conformity towards the neocon/noelib
agenda of policing and decadent DIStraction.

It seems the only peoples willing to make or take a stand in the name of
and for the advancement of the cause against tyranny = ignorance are
those we are told are villains, criminals, nare do wells, anitgays,
sexist and terrorists... so be it then are the new heroes, the new
radicals and revolutionaries for a new a millenium.

"These poor Indians are incapable of producing cinema films to show the
reality of what happened. But the Americans can produce many films to
present the American soldiers as poor people who are defending
civilization, and they place red feathers on the heads of the Red
Indians picturing them as ignorant and immoral barbarians, and that they
are attacking the peaceful Americans who in fact came and raped their
lands and built forts on them." -- Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah

So be it that then -- this radicalism is found in peoples called
criminals and the so called backward violent faith of Islam because they
do what the left and the poser anarchist will not -- care for the poor,
they show strength, and are willing to stand up to tyrants. Then so be
it then -- that those the robber barons call criminal, therefore,
muslim, who are supposed be terrorist; those who follow the path of
islam, and choose to follow the way/do of TRU
civilization/thought/Knowledge Wise Dome Understanding are the only hope
for Freedome Justice Equalty -- our overcoming the oppressors in this
the twisted era of greed and callousness--for were not Che, the Black
Panthers and Blacks, who learned to read, once considered criminals, as
well as, women who tried to vote. Was not Malcolm once Conned and
assumed that all was as the oppressors said until he found the voices of
the TRU radicals – not lost in the what Eliot called the “wasteland”.

“ …a white man can’t fight a guerilla war. Guerilla action takes heart:
takes nerve and he doesn’t have that.” -- Malik el Shabazz -- “The
ballot or the Bullet”

People once quoted Mao and Marx and now in this era Shariati, Malik
Shabazz, Ali ibn abu Talib, Leonard Peltier, The Native Youth Movement
should be counted among the revolutionary voices of all students and Tru
radicals and the actions of the Russian revolution, the Cuban revolution
should not be forgotten B.U.T. the heroes of the new revolutions should
be honoured and preserved – from Iran to Iraq to Palestine to Ireland to
Quebec… B.U.T will the revolution against tyranny and oppression ever
travel here or is that what our enemies are afraid of are we too
DIStracted and CONvinced of fear = their power? Is that what our enemies
count on?

“My friend, Ali sacrificed his life for these considerations: School of
Thought, Unity and Justice. It was evident in his twenty-three years of
struggles and sacrifices to establish faith in the hearts of barbaric
parties. It was evident in his twenty-five years of silence and
endurance in order to preserve Islamic unity and save it from the
dangers of the Roman and Persian empires. It was evident in his five
years of work and suffering to achieve justice, using his sword to
destroy hatred and liberate man. Though he was not able to achieve this,
he managed to impart to us the meaning of the leadership of mankind and
religion. He placed his life and the life of his family on these three
slogans: School of Thought, Unity and Justice!”—Dr Shariati


people are hanging the the posers who wear those Che t-shirts out to
dry, and using the media and their lies as wrapping for fish and chips,
as the TRU rock their hoods with Sadr, Nasrallah, The Native Youth
Movement, the almost forgotten and coopted Black Panthers and their TRU
comunity activism, The New Black Panther party, the words and Knowledge
of Ali Ibn Abu Talib, Mumia Abu Jamal, Leonard Peltier, Rose Henry, Big
Garlic Bobcat, Junious Ricardo Stanton, The Carbon Afrikan Nation, Aaron
Vidaver, Osiris, Abu Jamal, Watanabe, Shariati, Kwame Ture, Rev Davin
Ouimet, Malik el Shabazz, the prophecies of Garvey and Honourable Elijah
Muhammad. …


people raise the picture of Che or put his face up on walls and/in
windows -- perhaps they should consider also a heart closer to our hoods
-- Anthany James Dawson as a symbol of the martyrs of North Amerikkka
like Amadou Diallo and all the fallen everymen darker than blue.

word (s)

…and those we see risking their lives, standing strong without the
spotlight and lies and the media/propaganda for the system which tries
and lies to crush us all.

I am reminded of building a case…

Cyrill,

Your Sondheim valorization is commendable if you can keep it
up. There is a point when getting in bed with Alan leads to being
tied to it, like Seinfeld's George Castanza, expecting swell mutual
high-minded fucking, then your bedmate suddenly comes out of
the bathroom fully street-clothed, rifles your wallet, finds little there,
accuses you of being an idiot putz for failing to meet his thieving
expectations, for believing he was the man of your dreams, for
falling for a slick seduction exploiting your low esteem, for your
thinking this is a man who knows my finer qualities, can boost my
future when it was bleak.

Philosophical sadists, artists of the con art, excel at that stroking
of mindful aesthetes preparatory to rendering them obedient,
the masterful auto-erotic narcissists contemning their slaves ever
dreaming abject praise will stop the addictive torture.

Your panhandling for contributions indicates it is too late to escape
Alan's pimpage, still, I will pray a genuine fundamentalist ideologue
comes to your rescue, frying pan to fire ending the delirious pain of
the lost boy.

Alan was once my hero, my mentor, my sole voice of mother-fathering
solace. Then came the signs of disease, the rejection, the blame,
the ridicule, the ostracization, the eviction from acceptable discourse,
the being found by others who'd also suffered from Alan's olympian
conceit, his ever-searching for victims to toy with. We warn you, pity
your state of false belief.

Hello everyone,

Anyone know what's going on with Sun&Moon and Green Integer?  There are a
bunch of titles I'm trying to get for a local bookstore.  Neither SPD nor
Consortium seem to have them.  They say some have been canceled, out of
print, etc.

Anybody know what's going on?  Is GI going to print versions of all the old
S&M stuff?

I'm looking for

LAB's Polyverse
Schaeffer's Nova
Swenson's Noon
Hocquard's work generally
and others

Are any of these titles remaindered/squirreled away anywhere?

Thanks in advance.

Ken

Sun & Moon is defunct, but I believe that Green Integer is still very
viable.

Have you tried simply ordering books directly off of Green Integers=B9s
website?

Honestly- It was just a quirky idea that I had. I do not wish to be anything
important, I was just, quite literrally, tossing it out there. I can explain
how, at least in my mind, Reich's body armoring relates to what I percieve
to be an understanding of chakras. Reich contended that neurosis was
visibile in the body, and that the deeper the neurosis the more armoring
occurred, starting from the pelvis & working its way up. The center of the
biological body was for Reich the pelvis... I know this for a fact. His
understanding of body armoring came before his discovery of the orgone, and
after his theory of the orgasm. Furthermore, he contended that without
overcoming a sexual stasis it was impossible to successfully end treatment.
He actually wrote that in every single patient he had, without exception,
there was a sexual stasis. He contented that nymphomania & impotency were
both classified as a sexual stasis.  He found that in extreme cases,
patients were unable to express a diversity of emotions in the face (the
last chakra, I think, & his final layer of body armoring). I guess this list
is more judgemental & less interested in thinking then I imagined. Joseph
Campbell? Give me a fucking break... The yoga aspect came more from personal
experience & thousands of years of wisdom which I believe to be valid. The
connections are mine. Interesting enough, I found that a proper class of
yoga actually had the exact same effect upon me as repseridone (an
anti-pyschotic). I feel healthy & enjoy taking yoga classes & am once again
med free. If anyone was interested, my genitalia are fine & I have no
intentions of losing them. I guess its best if we drop the subject & get
back to the classic mine is bigger then yours type discussion. Have a good
day. Ian VanHeusen

I should have read this email before my last post... I was considering the
physical differences & the posturings of Eastern Monks & Western Monks.
Eastern monks tend to appear healthy whereas Western Monks tend not to. I
figured that both could sublimate their sexual desires, but I figured in the
East it was more in harmony with the body. Thanks for the consideration. Ian

"Secular Jewish Culture / Radical Poetic Practice"
Tuesday, Sept. 21, 2004 -- 7pm
Center for Jewish History
15 West 16th Street, Manhattan

What are the innovations and inventions of American Jewish poets, over the
past century? Can we say that there is distinctly Jewish component to
radical modernist and contemporary poetry? What is the relation of Jewish
modernist and contemporary poets to the historical avant-garde and to
contemporary innovative poetry? How does Jewish cultural life and ethnic
and religious forms and traditions manifest themselves in the forms,
styles, and approaches to radical American poetry? What role does a
distinctly secular approach to Jewishness by poets and other Jewish artists
mean for "radical Jewish culture"?

There will be several live two-way video feeds of the panel, including
(tentatively) at Notre Dame, the University of Utah, and the University of
Minnesota.

For the second consecutive year, the Spare Room reading series brings
together widely dispersed practitioners of the literary-musical-theatrical
art of sound poetry.

Though less familiar to audiences in the United States, sound poetry has a
long and distinguished history in Europe, where numerous international
festivals, recordings, broadcasts, and publications have been devoted to its
manifestations. Beginning nearly a century ago with the Russian and Italian
Futurists, and the Dadaist! s in Switzerland and Germany, and taking
retrospective roots in archaic and ritual utterances, sound poetry has been
elaborated in countless directions by post-disciplinary artists on every
continent.

(The extensive collection of text documents and sound files at www.ubu.com
is perhaps the most accessible and comprehensive resource for an overview of
sound poetry, past and present.)

What is Sound Poetry? Well, to begin with, it is not new. And since it began
it has not made sense. It takes language's constraints seriously. It is
about sound, and I have nothing more to say about it.
    -- mARK oWEns

The first phase, perhaps better-termed, the first area of sound poetry, is
the vast, intractable area of archaic and primitive poetries, the many
instances of chant st! ructures and incantation, of nonsense syllabic
mouthings and deliberate lexical distortions still alive among North
American, African, Asian and Oceanic peoples. We should also bear in mind
the strong and persistent folkloric and ludic strata
that manifests in the world's many language games, in the nonsense syllabary
of nursery rhymes, mnemonic counting aids, whisper games and skipping
chants, mouth music and folk-song refrain,
which foregrounds as an important compositional element in work as
chronologically separate as the Russian Futurist Kruchenykh's zaum poems
(ca. 1910) and Bengt af Klintberg's use of cusha-calls and incantations (ca.
1965).
    -- Steve McCaffery, "Sound Poetry: A Survey"

Leonardo da Vinci asked the poet to give him something he might see and
touch and not just something he could hear. Sound poetry seems to me to be
achieving this aim. PARTLY it is a recapturing of a more primitive form of
language, before communication ! by expressive sounds became stereotyped
into words, when the voice was richer in vibrations, more mightily physical.
    -- Bob Cobbing, "Some Statements on Sound Poetry"

I, personally, would prefer the chaos and disorder which each of us would
strive to master, in terms of his own ingenuousness, to the order imposed by
the Word which everybody uses indiscriminately, always for the benefit of a
capital, of a church, of a socialism, etc....
    -- Henri Chopin, "Why I Am the Author of Sound Poetry . . ." (1967)

The art is text-sound, as distinct from text-print and text-seen, which is
to say that texts must be sounded and thus heard to be "read," in contrast
to those that must be printed and thus be seen. The art is text-sound,
rather than sound-text, to acknowledge the initial presence of a text, which
is subject to aural enhancements more typical of music. To be precise, it is
by non-melodic auditory structures that la! nguage or verbal sounds are
poetically charged with meanings or resonances they would not otherwise
have. The most appropriate generic term for the initial materials would be
"vocables," which my dictionary defines as "a word regarded as a unit of
sounds or letters rather than as a unit of meaning."
    -- Richard Kostelanetz, "Text Sound Art: A Survey"
Best, Crag Hill

time of the california seahare
http://www.asondheim.org/cseahare.mov (greatly compressed)
i tried with the outdoors sound of the world
i battered the sound and mavericked it
the california seahare Aplysia californica was silent
it cannot hear the sound of the camera peering from above
and slightly to one side
this is the song of the california seahare
oh silent and moving slowly and grazing on Ulva
and graving on everything and moving slowly
with the beauty of the matrix and twenty megabytes

tonight is full of sadness
the california sea hare has several thousand neurons never dreaming
i will live their life
i will be without memory and without clarity
so many millions of years as if it were this very moment
almost a mourning water weeping air

Subject: A Special Call for Submissions

Dear Readers:
The American presidential election is coming up in November, and (at the
risk of sounding Ameri-centric) this is, clearly, an important time for both
the United States and the world at large.
In early October, The Pedestal Magazine will release a special "political
issue." We will be accepting works of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction, as
well as art. All work should somehow address current political concerns,
however popular or obscure, general or specific, they may be. We are open to
all views and positions; i.e., liberal and conservative, Democrat and
Republican, etc. There are no length restrictions. We are open to
extended/complex works or brief statements, pieces that take on specific
themes or are more generally philosophic in nature. We also welcome
submissions (actually, we strongly request them) from people in countries
other than the United States. If you would like to send us an accompanying
photograph of yourself, please include one as an attachment in .jpg format.
We will not be offering payment to contributors; however, we will
aggressively market the issue, as well as partner with various organizations
in an attempt to reach and impact people around the world.
Send all work to pedmagazine@carolina.rr.com. If you are submitting artwork,
please send all images as attachments in .jpg format. In the subject line of
the email, type: Submission/Political Issue. Please DO NOT use the
submission form provided on The Pedestal Magazine website to submit work for
this special issue.
Please feel free to forward this email to contacts or friends and to post it
on relevant forums or message boards.
The deadline for submissions is September 21.
Please feel free to email us at pedmagazine@carolina.rr.com, if you have any
additional questions.
It is our intention to use as many pieces as possible, although we cannot
guarantee that we will publish everything we receive.
We look forward to including a wide variety of writings in this special
release and wish you much inspiration during this time of excitement and
difficulty.
All my best,
John Amen

Ma "mere" est une sale pute. Elle a detruit ma jeunesse. Elle a tue mon
beau-pere, qui etait un facho. Elle me l'a avoue deux fois, a six mois
d'intervalle, alors qu'elle etait completement bourree. son nom est dominique
duneau. elle habite 83 rue theophile lamy, 18000 bourges. l'homme qu'elle a tue
s'appelait patrice germe.

j'ai pris mes medocs, bobig. xanax et zeroxat. aujourd'hui je suis archive dans
la base de donnees de Rhizome.org. j'ai un beau costume, un beret, un bon
salaire. je suis un vrai pouet.

La france, c'est comme la gauche. ca n'existe pas.

"A kenning is commonly a simple stock compound such as "whale-path" or "swan
road" for "sea"; "God's beacon" for "sun"; or "ring-giver" for "king."  Many
kennings are allusions that become unintelligible to later generations. A
non-Germanic analogue is the Homeric epithet, e.g., "rosy-fingered dawn." See
also skaldic poetry."

Here is some information about each book:

About Devin Johnston's AVERSIONS,

Susan Howe comments that these poems are "uncannily precise responses of an
exacting lyric consciousness to the quotidian facts of experience.
Accurate, supernatural, unexpected turns connect without connectives, as if
by telepathic electricity."

Michael OBrien writes that these poems "devote themselves to making
distinctions. They take great care with cadence and music, but their art
is, by conviction, unobtrusive.... convincing, full of regard for the world."

****
About Martha Ronk's IN A LANDSCAPE OF HAVING TO REPEAT,

Ann Lauterbach comments that this poet "writes across, and through, the
invisible boundaries that condition our lives: past and present, dream and
waking, intimacy and estrangement."

Bin Ramke writes that "[i]t is not so much Martha Ronk's voice as her
vision which has become so necessary insistent, persistent, passionate,
engaging simultaneously the familiar and the new."

***
About Keith Waldrop's THE REAL SUBJECT, QUERIES AND CONJECTURES OF JACOB
DELAFON, WITH SAMPLE POEMS,

Robet Kelly writes "Waldrop's character, though named for a famous French
supplier of sanitary fixtures, seems tenderly American, readily taken aback
by ideas, a pilgrim of the literal."

Ben Marcus comments "a brilliantly sidewinding embrace of uncertainty, a
pulpit for arcane knowledge, and a cleverly constructed language filter
that keeps out everything but beauty and strangeness."

Marjorie Welish writes "Waldrop's poetic ear is as perfect as can be, his
rhetoric as thoughtful as possible, romantic ironies evanesce."

Subject: Iraqui Olympic footballers tell Bush a thing or two

from Sports Illustrated
Posted: Thursday August 19, 2004 12:50PM

Unwilling participants
Iraqi soccer players angered by Bush campaign ads

PATRAS, Greece -- Iraqi midfielder Salih Sadir scored a goal here on
Wednesday night, setting off a rousing celebration among the 1,500
Iraqi soccer supporters at Pampeloponnisiako Stadium. Though Iraq --
the surprise team of the Olympics -- would lose to Morocco 2-1, it
hardly mattered as the Iraqis won Group D with a 2-1 record and now
face Australia in the quarterfinals on Sunday.

Afterward, Sadir had a message for U.S. president George W. Bush, who
is using the Iraqi Olympic team in his latest re-election campaign
advertisements.

In those spots, the flags of Iraq and Afghanistan appear as a narrator
says, "At this Olympics there will be two more free nations -- and two
fewer terrorist regimes."
"Iraq as a team does not want Mr. Bush to use us for the presidential
campaign," Sadir told SI.com through a translator, speaking calmly and
directly. "He can find another way to advertise himself."

Ahmed Manajid, who played as a midfielder on Wednesday, had an even
stronger response when asked about Bush's TV advertisement. "How will
he meet his god having slaughtered so many men and women?" Manajid told
me. "He has committed so many crimes."

"The ad simply talks about President Bush's optimism and how democracy
has triumphed over terror," said Scott Stanzel, a spokesperson for
Bush's campaign. "Twenty-five million people in Iraq are free as a
result of the actions of the coalition."

To a man, members of the Iraqi Olympic delegation say they are glad
that former Olympic committee head Uday Hussein, who was responsible
for the serial torture of Iraqi athletes and was killed four months
after the U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq in March 2003, is no longer
in power.

But they also find it offensive that Bush is using Iraq for his own
gain when they do not support his administration's actions. "My
problems are not with the American people," says Iraqi soccer coach
Adnan Hamad. "They are with what America has done in Iraq: destroy
everything. The American army has killed so many people in Iraq. What
is freedom when I go to the [national] stadium and there are shootings
on the road?"

At a speech in Beaverton, Ore., last Friday, Bush attached himself to
the Iraqi soccer team after its opening-game upset of Portugal. "The
image of the Iraqi soccer team playing in this Olympics, it's
fantastic, isn't it?" Bush said. "It wouldn't have been free if the
United States had not acted."

Sadir, Wednesday's goal-scorer, used to be the star player for the
professional soccer team in Najaf. In the city in which 20,000 fans
used to fill the stadium and chant Sadir's name, U.S. and Iraqi forces
have battled loyalists to rebel cleric Moktada al-Sadr for the past two
weeks. Najaf lies in ruins.

"I want the violence and the war to go away from the city," says Sadir,
21. "We don't wish for the presence of Americans in our country. We
want them to go away."

Manajid, 22, who nearly scored his own goal with a driven header on
Wednesday, hails from the city of Fallujah. He says coalition forces
killed Manajid's cousin, Omar Jabbar al-Aziz, who was fighting as an
insurgent, and several of his friends. In fact, Manajid says, if he
were not playing soccer he would "for sure" be fighting as part of the
resistance.

"I want to defend my home. If a stranger invades America and the people
resist, does that mean they are terrorists?" Manajid says. "Everyone
[in Fallujah] has been labeled a terrorist. These are all lies.
Fallujah people are some of the best people in Iraq."

Everyone agrees that Iraq's soccer team is one of the Olympics' most
remarkable stories. If the Iraqis beat Australia on Saturday -- which
is entirely possible, given their performance so far -- they would
reach the semifinals. Three of the four semifinalists will earn medals,
a prospect that seemed unthinkable for Iraq before this tournament.

When the Games are over, though, Coach Hamad says, they will have to
return home to a place where they fear walking the streets. "The war is
not secure," says Hamad, 43. "Many people hate America now. The
Americans have lost many people around the world--and that is what is
happening in America also."

Stephen:

Sports Illustrated is one of the few publications that Bush reads besides
the Book of Revelations.
Interesting, too, that South- and North Korea are at the Olympics as a
unified team. This is heartening.
What is disheartening, however, is the continuous display of jingoism by
Americans in Athens, even though they've been told to tone it down. I'd like
to have pride in my country. I'd like to see it win a gold medal in human
rights. Then I, too, will wave the flag.

Miller Brewing Co. apologized Thursday for failing to include any black
artists on its series of commemorative rock 'n roll cans. The Associated
Press reported Sunday that the brewer, in a promotion with Rolling Stone
magazine, did not have a black artist on the cans as part of its celebration
of the "50th Anniversary of Rock 'n' Roll."

I clipped the attachment which is a link to software, but what do people

Jameson's thesis about language poetry?   A deeper plot to subvert

I am cutting & pasting... hope I have not sent this before... here is a good
prayer from my current church...

Let all nations listen for the prophets yet speaking, that people should
rejoice in what they ought to be seeking...

Junky corporated to the consumer suit, a deck of cards
signifying nothing but a future without its own ability
the masochistic urge to procreate a power that breeds
institutions          cold monasteries of a knowledge
cursed for a lack of love in the truest sense
& intoxicated by the mantra of its name.

& the arts decorate the avenue quaint as to ignore
culture the result of a society seeking itself
in distraction             anything or everything
to exclude the bombshell of the truth
just beyond the grasp of reason adorned
with comfort.

Meanwhile the revolution watches the scenario
confused at the impossibility of the sincere joy of correction
entrenched in subculture seeing a life unusual
as the only practical outcome of the gift
           civilization finally stagnating         unhinging
to the possibility of a good generation
to sooth the problem
sometimes it seems more appropriate to raise
warriors in our children as if to study the future
shows how the horizon is most likely littered with a multitude of the dead
& beyond the war’s conclusion?
1,000 midnights of a nuclear holocaust imminent
                            in position
or the rebirth of Mother Earth
the feminine energy to revitalize to life to live
to grow to plant to sow to seed to hold
all the faculties of the human
as secondary to the body.

in a nation, under-handing symbols & plain signs on ignorance
but behind every redneck there is a scholar
waiting to make the killing       look it up, they register their names
in pride not trying to hide how they heard Hitler’s call
of an Aryan Nation sparked in India as the Dravidians cried
under foot & the name of Krishna was turned to soot
his skin was always brown but his position changed
a Brahman, she explained it to the masses
as if in her words no one but me, a friend, recognized the accent
& in her the true disaster of Blanchot in her thinking
how her ego was sinking falling away for her blessings
her dressings were proper & her dance taught each step
how the indigenous flowed with the gestures, her tradition
tight & restricted but she moved to New York
heart devastated by a cruelly beautiful husband who fled to Ohio,
leaving her to ponder silence in the cold cement of the University
but she often shined in her diversity
& I would sit at her feet & listen to the melody of her sitar
drunk from the gift of her knowledge
for a goddess as she this simple poem
as if a woman blessed is the important thing to notice
like a rumor of a lady pollinated by the wind of god
whose son’s name is often used in jest
but sacred none the less,

now South America where blood mingled despite the holocaust
& their religion saved the entire thing for history
to repent in remembrance, but the genocide continues in the Mayan jungle
as the land is raped to bear taxes to the Gringo altar
while some claim atheism in their heart & stand back

not remembering how the music of dark drum skins
stirred the knowledge in the Buddha’s meditation from his palace
reminding him that despite privilege, we all suffer in a unique way
with a greater longing, & patience
giving to peace one soul whose thinking I can only begin
to wait to hear to see through the eyes of faith
instead of destruction, as if without our souls we are truly just war
machines
to eat & shit our time away

& yes John Afrika we are all descendants of that original continent
born from the Rift valley & shades of the same rainbow
in the winter cold, some were forced to hide from the sun
some walked farther than imagination could ever tell
created wells of knowledge along the way
each beautiful                   each equal before the same sky
yet our home is wracked by disease & warfare
here as it is there, if even the scares are disguised behind angry stares
& who is beware, but the seed in my soul to plant wisdom
mother earth hold my hand
father sky shower me with rhythm.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

MARCH 18, 2003
by Michael Lally
Is from Libellum, publishers
211 West 19th Street, 5th Floor
10011
(36 pages, cover by Alex Katz, no price or distributor mentioned, but you
can probably 'Amazon-it.' )

In keeping with the times, someone brought this small, beautifully designed
and produced book, instead of pro forma wine, to dinner last night. And what
a timely gift! Lally read this at anti-war poetry reading of the title date
at the Paula Cooper Gallery. Indeed I think it's the best contemporary
political poem I have read. (I recently read Zukofsky's A-10 - written in
1941 - which is also right on the pulse, as well).

Lally - who picks up Frank O'Hara's open voice, questioning 'personism'
persona - takes that mode a full step further - and essentially both the
country and the globe into a dartboard of targeted questions aimed at
multiple political hotspots in which each line of fire keeps splitting the
rhetorical board into pieces (Iraq, Palestine-Israel, Voting Machines,
Torture, etc). Instead of "personism", one might call the mode "a-personism"
- where the person's voice becomes an Everyman who is the antithesis of most
everything you find of FOX TV. (Lally taking the pants off O'Reilly and his
'factors.') I can only exemplify, from near the start:
...
If some white folks build
a housing complex on an Indian reservation
with money from white supremacists
and they use the few resources
the reservation has to make their housing project
bigger and better than the Native American houses
and some of the Native Americans
demonstrate against this, and the response
of our government is to build a barbed wire fence
around the white enclave and send soldiers
to man watchtowers and protect the whites
and this pisses the Native Americans off
and their demonstrations get rowdy
and some Indian kids throw rocks at the soldiers
and the soldiers shoot and kill some of these kids
and the Indians get even more upset
and vow to stop the settlements
and get the whites off their land...


The 34 pages mount into a literal 'tour-de-force' - harsh & cleansing, and a
genuine public poem, where such is so rare. It's such a difficult thing to
do. (One thinks - through out the sixties and seventies - where most public
efforts at the form became either a parody of Howl or somehow could never
break away from the umbrella of that work. Z's "A-10" is a refreshing
forbear of Howl - tho more mediated in its anger and rebuke).   Lally's poem
strikes me as a genuine break through - partly because its so both deeply
informed and felt, but the more so because it radiates the vulnerability
that I think many of us experience now in relationship to what appear as
overwhelming Corporate, etc. odds. While, at the same time, the work is
definitely an unshakable call for "the rocks" in whatever form one can shape
those in language, or whatever counter-offensive medium - say 'voting' - one
can still count as one's own.

I say get it and spread it around.

Proxy  Soldiers in Bush's War
Mexico  Fiercely Opposes the Iraq War, But
Mexicans Are Dying There Every Week
By  JOHN ROSS

"She died on Friday thinking  about coming home to eat beans and carnitas."

Father of Sgt. Isela Rubacalva

MEXICO CITY.

When Lance Corporal Juan Lopez Rangel  was killed in a firefight near the
rebel city of Fallujah in  Al Anbar province just west of Baghdad on
June 21st,
his grieving  parents, who now live in a small Georgia town, were
determined
to bury the proud marine in his hometown of San Luis de la Paz,  Guanajuato
Mexico, a dusty crossroads in the shadow of the desolate  Sierra Gorda where
the only action after dark are the all-night  funeral parlors and from which
Juan Lopez and his family escaped  when he was 15 for a new life on the
Other Side.

Juan's funeral set for Mexico  over the July 4th weekend--U.S. Independence
Day--would include  plenty of patriotic fanfare--U.S. patriotic fanfare.
After
negotiations  with Mexican authorities over protocols, it was agreed that a
four member U.S. Marine Corps Honor Guard carrying ceremonial  weapons
could accompany the interment--a 21 gun salute with M-16s  was nixed by
the Mexican military.

The U.S. marines paraded solemnly  through the empty streets of San Luis
de la Paz, stopping in  front of the old house on Zaragoza Street where Juan
had been  born and where now he was being mourned. "Your son was a
hero in our country" the marine spokesman told Juan's parents,  presenting
Francisco Lopez and Delfina Rangel with a neatly folded  U.S. flag. Then
with the pallbearers in place and the U.S. Marine  Corps leading the way,
the final procession set out for the town  cemetery.

But a few blocks short of its  destination, the passage of the cortege was
blocked by a dozen  armed Mexican soldiers who demanded that the
marines surrender  their "ceremonial" arms or be held in violation of
Mexico's tough firearms laws. When the honor guard refused, the  marines
were escorted back to the vehicles that had brought them  to San Luis and
surrounded by the Mexican troops until Taps had  sounded at graveside.

The message of this poignant  tableau was clear: the Mexican army would
not tolerate armed  foreign troops on Mexican soil, particularly those of a
nation  that has repeatedly invaded Mexico.

The standoff at Juan Lopez  Rangel's funeral outraged U.S. ambassador
Tony Garza, a Bush  crony who seems to have spent his entire career here
defending  one U.S. aggression after another. "Jose Lopez (sic) was  a hero
and a native son of Mexico  who Mexicans should honor," the offended
Garza complained.

The ambassador's sentiment  was echoed by Dr. Jorge Santibanez, director
of the prestigious  College of the Northern Border and an expert on Mexican
out-migration,  who wrote of duel allegiances and pressures upon immigrant
youth  to sign up for the U.S. military. After Santibanez's remarks  were
published in the national daily La Jornada, the border think  tank's e-mail
began to ring off the hook with angry messages.  "This boy was not a hero
but a victim of the bad policies  of Bush," read one from a group of
self-described patriotic  railroad workers, "our heroes are not the traitors
who join  the American army but those Mexicans who fought the Americanos
when they invaded our country in 1846."

Even as Taps was being sounded  over Juan Lopez's bier up in Guanajuato
this past July 4th weekend,  several thousand anti-war protestors were
taking advantage of  the U.S. holiday to build a mock-up of Abu Ghraib
prison in front  of Garza's embassy on Mexico City's Reforma boulevard.
The demonstrators  laid out 12,000 white paper crosses on the sidewalk
to honor  the Iraqis killed since the American invasion began 16 months
ago. A hooded student perched precariously on a cardboard box,  electric
cables attached to his genitals, a dark icon of the  Yanqui "liberation" of
Iraq for which Juan Lopez had  just given up his life.

 >From top to bottom, Mexico  has rejected Bush's war since its inception.
President Vicente  Fox refused to support White House plans to bomb Iraq,
earning  Bush's eternal enmity, and the chill has frozen bi-lateral
relations
between these two distant neighbor nations ever since. The U.S.
threatened and spied upon the Mexican delegation at the United  Nations
Security Council and when Ambassador Adolfo Aguilar would  not bend,
Bush unilaterally declared war and stepped up recruitment  of Mexican
and Mexican American youth to illegally invade Iraq.

Juan Lopez Rangel was the 36th  and most recent U.S. soldier of Mexican
descent to die in Iraq  (since this was written two more G.I.s of Mexican
descent have  appeared in the New York Times daily list of the dead.) By
this  reporter's count, 20 of the dead soldiers were born in Mexico  and 16
were the children of migrants who had gone over to the  other side to find
their fortune in El Norte. The number of Mexican  deaths in Iraq equals the
number of Mexicans awaiting execution  on Texas death row.

Among the Mexican dead are  at least three women, including one of Jessica
Lynch's tank mates.  After Sergeant Isela Rubacalva, 25, a native of Ciudad
Juarez,  was killed near Mosul in May, her father Ramon mourned "she  died
on Friday thinking about coming home to eat carnitas and  beans, drink a
beer and go to a dance. This war is useless, as  useless as Vietnam."

Although it is not a member  of Bush's crumbling "coalition of the willing",
Mexico  has taken more casualties than any other nation in this cruel
conflict outside of Iraq, the U.S., and Great Britain.

The first to fall was Rodrigo  Gonzalez, the son of Coahuila farmers, whose
helicopter went  down in Kuwait February 25th 2003, even before the
invasion began.  Four Mexicans and one Guatemalan were killed in the first
days  of Bush's aggression--marine units from Camp Pendleton where  most
California Mexican recruits train were in the vanguard of  the invading
force.
"Latinos Give Their Lives For Their  New Land" The New York Times
editorialized.

Joining the marines has become  a sort of macho rite of passage for Mexican
kids in southern  California. Full court press recruitment in high
school and
promises  to fix migration problems lures young people whose only other
options are fieldwork or a dead-end job at McDonalds. 13,000  members of
the U.S. Marine Corps--8% of the force--are either  Mexican or Mexican
American. Mexicans and Mexican Americans account  for 55% of the 109,000
Latinos--Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, and Central Americans--who constitute
a tenth of the United States armed forces.

Although non-citizens are barred  from induction in the U.S. military (the
marines have an exemption),  the loopholes are large. To bolster
recruitment for the War on  Terror in the wake of the attacks on New York
and Washington, Bush issued new regs promising all non-citizens who
joined the  military after 9/11 that they would be on the "fast track"  for
citizenship. Still, despite Bush's edict, the only non-citizen  soldiers
(out of
a total 0f 37,000) who were eligible for immediate  citizenship were dead
ones--death in combat automatically conferred  this dubious honor
post-humously.

After the illusionary U.S.  victory announced May 1st, 2003 by Bush in his
"Mission  Completed" declaration from the deck of an aircraft carrier  off
San Diego, all non-citizens serving in Iraq were granted  immediate
citizenship.

One of the first Mexican soldiers  to be killed in action in Iraq was Jesus
Suarez who grew up in  Tijuana but came to California after his father won
immigration  amnesty. When the military offered Fernando Suarez
post-mortem  citizenship for his son, he turned it down. His son was a
Mexican  and proud of it--an "Aztec warrior" so enamored of  his indigenous
roots that he had joined a Tijuana "concheros"  Aztec dance troupe.

Convinced of the futility of  his son's sacrifice, Fernando Suarez later
traveled to Iraq to  see where Jesus had fallen and to talk to other Latino
soldiers  about what they are doing in that occupied land. "Their  faces are
hard but you can see their true sentiments in their  eyes" the elder Suarez
wrote in an e-mail, "their gaze asks what am I doing killing innocent
people for nothing?"  This summer, Fernando Suarez joined anti-war
protests at the political conventions.

Other Mexican families have  suffered grievously over the loss of their
children in Iraq.  Ruben Estrella Sr., one of four El Paso Texas Mexican
fathers  whose sons or daughters were taken from them by Bush's illegal
war, is suing the army because, he says, the family was cheated  out of
his son's death benefits by an unscrupulous recruiter.  Angela Banuelos, the
mother of Lance Corporal Juan Carlos Cabral,  heard about his death while
serving time in an Ohio penitentiary.  Zeferino Colunga, the father of yet
another dead Mexican G.I.,  was deported to his native Michoacan after
living for over a  decade in Texas.

Now with the U.S. military  facing an alarming short-fall to fight the
Terror
War and collateral  "preventative" wars to be waged upon the darker
peoples  of the world, the head-hunting of Mexican youth on both sides of
the border (U.S. recruiters have repeatedly invaded Ciudad  Juarez and
Tijuana high schools seeking duel citizenship students)  is sure to be
stepped up. Although Latinos are now the largest  U.S. minority, they are
under-represented in the armed forces  and the Pentagon has launched a
full-blast media campaign on  Spanish-speaking media to sign them up.

"The recruiters have a  lot of guilt for the death of our children" Fernando
Suarez  considers, "they tell them that only the veterans will go  to fight
the war and it isn't true. Most of the Mexicans who  have died in Iraq did
not even have a year of military service."

Mexicans often join and serve  together in the military. There are high
concentrations of Mexicans  and Mexican Americans in California marine
units, Texas National  Guard units, and, for some unexplained statistical
quirk, there  are many Mexican Patriot missile operators.

A New York Times reporter recently  spent a day on patrol in south Baghdad
with Company A of the  Fifth Calvary which has many Mexican and
Mexican-American members  recruited principally off the streets of East Los
Angeles. The  stories they told of their months in Iraq confirm what
Fernando
Suarez saw in their eyes when he visited.

Specialist Ray Flores was shot  twice in the head at the beginning of April,
a cruel month for  U.S. casualties. His buddy Roberto Araiga, who was
sitting
right  next to him, was killed instantly--Roberto had just been denied leave
to go home and get married. When he returned from the hospital,  Flores's
superiors informed him that his tour of duty had been  extended for 14
months. Now he is confined to barracks for "mental  stress" and sits in a
window seat all day, his automatic  weapon trained on the terrain. "My life
is ruined,"  he told the Times reporter, "I am all alone out here."

Specialist Gerardo Barrajas  just wants out. His homeboy Jose Gonzalez
caught one early in  the war and Gerardo wants to go back to the barrio
and marry  the "ruca" whose photo is pinned up in his tank turret,  and not
in a flag-draped coffin. But there are pressures. While  the Times reporter
is present, Barrajas is bullied and abused  by his commanding officer, also
a Latino, as a "parasite"  for being reluctant to re-up.

For specialist Jesse Lopez,  another East L.A. boy, there are few options.
"I'd rather  be doing what I'm doing here (presumably killing Iraqis - ed
note) than flipping Big Macs at the minimum wage." Lopez  had just
re-upped for four years.

For Mexican G.I.s and those  of Mexican descent in Iraq, there is no more
significant role  model than Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, the
former commander  of U.S. occupation forces. "To the Mexican people, he
is  a great hero," boasts Sergeant Ernesto Quijada whose family  migrated
from Cancun to New York ten years ago (actually, the  "Mexican people"
generally don't know that General  Sanchez is a Mexican.)

A poor kid `from Rio Grande  City, across the big river from the honky
tonk town of Miguel  Aleman Tamaulipas on the Mexican side, Sanchez
grew up ragged  and hungry in south Texas. His father, an itinerant welder,
disappeared  when he was six and the family survived on welfare. An older
brother who joined the military and came back from Vietnam with  medals
was Ricardo's own role model. A ROTC kid who literally  pulled himself up
by his bootstraps in a post-Vietnam, more 'multicultural"  military, Sanchez
moved up the ranks quickly and his big break  came as deputy to General
John Abizaid in Kosovo.

Although Sanchez's military  career has been a stunning success until quite
recently, he has  always been burdened by his humble Mexican origins and
the fact  that he is not a West Pointer, and has had to battle for
recognition
at every step of the way, a personal struggle that has made him  a role
model for young Mexican and Mexican American troops.

But General Sanchez, whose  greatest moment of glory came with the
capture of Saddam Hussein  in his spider hole in December 2003, seems to
have fallen into  his own spider hole of late. 600 U.S. troops went home in
flag-draped  coffins during his June-to-June tenure at the head of the
occupation  forces with no weapons of mass destruction or victory in sight.
More painfully, the tortures on his watch at Abu Ghraib prison,  a
ten-minute
helicopter ride from Sanchez's Baghdad airport command  post, have
permanently stained his once-unblemished reputation.

General Sanchez was recently  passed over to take over the Southern
Command which oversees  all U.S. military operations in Latin America, a
post he was  expected to fill, and it now seems unlikely that he will ever
achieve the fourth star he has long coveted. Although some Mexican  troops
charge that General Sanchez has been unjustly scapegoated  for the Abu
Ghraib abuses by Rumsfeld and the Pentagon brass,  the career of this
Latino role model is kaput, one more Mexican  victim of Bush's illegal war
in Iraq.

John Ross will be on the spot in Mexico City  for much of July and August
before sallying forth to do maximum  mischief at the Republican National
Convention in Manhattan from  where he will launch the intergalactic tour
of his latest instant  cult classic "Murdered  By Capitalism--A Memoir of
150 Years of Life & Death on the  U.S. Left".

DROWNED OUT

Directed by Franny Armstrong (2002, 75 min., UK) Armstrong's documentary
presents audiences with the three choices faced by the people of Jalsindhi
in central India: move to the slums in the city, accept a place at a
resettlement site or stay at home and drown. They must make a decision fast.
In the next few weeks, their village will disappear underwater as the giant
Narmada Dam fills. Bestselling author Arundhati Roy joins the fight against
the dam and asks the difficult questions: Will the water go to poor farmers
or to rich industrialists? What happened to the 16 million people displaced
by fifty years of dam building? Why should I care?

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and taverns!),
utilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented forms. We
will explore the structural possibilities of language to ultimately answer
the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning and practiced
poets will generate lots of original writing from this full day of language
play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye with which to
revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson Literary
Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the Arts, Mad
Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled notspeak.

I figured after reading the proxy article that was forwarded by Ishaq I
would throw this bit into the waters... I am a little tired. I might have to
visit 1,000 doctors because, unfortunately, I actually paid attention in
school & remember a good little motto
DARE: Just say No to drugs... besides for the specialists I am enjoying
life, trying to keep my head up in the middle of the Military Industrial
Complex...

"Call him drunken Ira Hayes he won't answer anymore,
not the whiskey drinking Indian or the Marine who went to war...

(skip a lot)

... jail was often his home, there they would let him raise & lower the flag
like you would throw a dog a bone."

I cannot validate the story, but the song says that Ira Hayes was one of the
"heroes"
of Iwagima (spelling ?)... go figure.
Peace,
Ian

this is made from a larger video to be sure, uniting the story of the
rheingold or rhinegold, I prefer the latter although I'm really not sure,
of course it might be the former, and pelican feeding and meditation, this
isn't really well thought-out, I've just been working and working on this,
it's hardly deep, there's symbolic value in a ring of course, but in fact
I loved the pelican, and couldn't add anything to it, the ring changes
into a cylinder, silent, probably not worth the price of admission, alan

I'm not sure. But a start would be, like in the original Olympics, the

Tired of those Swift boats running endlessly back and forth across the
screen? Much preferable and with much more humor, real pathos, etc. try:

Speedo
A Demolition Derby Love Story

A Film by Jesse Moss
August 24, Tuesday Night
10 PM (Eastern Standard Time)
National PBS Broadcast on the POV Series

Check Local PBS Listings and find more information about the film at
http://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2004/speedo/


This is also a shameless plug here for my friend Andrew Moss' son Jesse who
made the film. I saw a screening here in the Bay Area and was totally struck
by it (film, not the car).

Enjoy.

Blog: http://stephenvincent.durationpress.com

More detail:

 SPEEDO is a documentary about the promising racing career and troubled
family life of Ed "Speedo" Jager,
one of the nation's top demolition derby drivers.  Trapped in a failing
marriage, Speedo channels life's frustrations onto the track,
hoping to parlay his talents into a "real" racing career.  When he falls
for Liz, a track official from New Jersey, his life takes a surprising
turn.


"Funny and sad, often at the same time, this documentary is a head on
hit."
Entertainment Weekly

"Highly enjoyable."
Variety

"An instant cult classic."
Film Threat

Winner of Audience and Jury Awards at the Full Documentary Film
Festival, the Boston Independent Film Festival,
the Newport Film Festival, and the Hamptons International Film Festival

Jesse Moss is the founder of Mile End Films, a New York-based film and
television production company. Prior to "Speedo," Moss produced and
directed Con Man, a one-hour documentary about an Ivy League imposter,
which aired on HBO/Cinemax in 2002. He is currently completing a
documentary special for AMC about Republicans in Hollywood.

I want to take your degenerated cells within me
I want you to find a better man than me
I want you to fuck with life to the extreme
I want you to feel joy laughter and love the densest
I am with love in you
I am in life with you

As if this were not about to break
As if from the cracked pitcher
Birds did not fly out
As if across the window they seldom cast their shadow
As if not the goose
Than who
Would last this
Winter in which there is too much
Already
As if this winter would have us walk across it
As if I have not once cast a single shadow
As if a shadow were not allowed
As if the new snow wouldn't have
Sound of a pitcher about to break
Sound of a headache

============================================

Dear friend of UFPJ:

You may have already heard that a federal judge today denied the use
of Central Park for a protest at the Republican Convention.

This ruling concerns a different organization, seeking to hold a
protest on a different day. United for Peace and Justice will have a
hearing in state court tomorrow, Tuesday, August 24, seeking a court
order to rally in Central Park on Sunday, August 29. The outcome of
today's federal case has no direct bearing on our case in New York
State Supreme Court.

We expect a ruling in our case on Wednesday or Thursday, and remain
optimistic that the judge in our case will recognize our right to hold
a rally in Central Park.

No matter what the judge rules, we already have an agreement with the
City for a legal, peaceful march past Madison Square Garden, the site
of the Republican Convention. If we win our court case, we will march
to Central Park for an exuberant rally. If we lose in court, we will
negotiate with the City for a safe, peaceful, and orderly closure of
the day's events. (We will NOT go to the West Side Highway.)

The Bush and Bloomberg Administrations are hoping that the uncertainty
about our protest will keep people away . we know their efforts to
squelch our protest make it all the more important that we have a
massive turnout in the streets, to say NO to the Bush agenda of war,
greed, hate and lies!

Please forward this email to your friends, family and colleagues, and
post it on any appropriate email lists.

If you live in the New York City area, please join us at the hearing
before the New York Supreme Court tomorrow, Tuesday, Aug. 24 at 9:00
am at 60 Centre Street. The judge has moved the hearing to a larger
room, to allow more people to attend; we will also hold a peaceful
picket outside the courthouse.

============================================
AUGUST 29, THE WORLD SAYS NO TO THE BUSH AGENDA!
Massive Protest at the Republican National Convention, New York City
* Assemble at 10:00AM, Seventh Avenue @ 14th Street

This fall I will be leading a prose workshop, which will meet 11
Tuesday evenings in my South of Market apartment from 7 to 10.  The
dates: September 21 through December 30.

By prose I mean fiction, nonfiction, prose poetry, cross-genre (and
cross-gender) writing including (but not exclusively) anything edgy
or experimental.  It's a good place to present work that feels too
risky or sexy or queer for academic workshops.  The workshops are
totally open-ended.  Five people present a week, scheduling that the
week ahead.  Usually people bring in something 5 pages or less
(copies for everybody) and we critique it that week.  Longer pieces
are also okay, but they need to be handed out a week ahead of time
for people to read.  Each student typically gets a half an hour each
time we critique.  The classes are limited to 9 students.  Lots and
lots of personal attention.  They take place in my South of Market
apartment, which comes complete with snacks and one cat.

My latest book, Pink Steam, a collection of fiction, memoir, and
memoiresque essays, was published in June by San Francisco's Suspect
Thoughts Press.  My vampire novel, The Letters of Mina Harker will be
reprinted by University of Wisconsin Press in October.  I'm the
author of 3 other books and I teach creative writing at SF State and
in the MFA program at Antioch Los Angeles. I've also taught at
CalArts, Naropa summer session, Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz, and the SF
Art Institute.  I'm the winner of the Bay Guardian Goldie Award for
Literature and the Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about cost, work samples, etc.
Or--if you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this
email along to them.  Past classes have filled up quickly, so if
you're interested do contact me promptly.

Thanks.

I am curious about agit-prop ideas for the Republican Convention -  both
kind and "demonic". The one's I have heard of so far include:

1. (Kind) Putting blue tarps across the roofs of Manhattan and the
Burroughs. Republicans - as they fly in on private or public aircraft - will
be put on notice that they are entering a "Blue" state.

2. (Demonic)  Suitcases: Anarchists are allegedly planning to leave empty
suitcases on Subway platforms. Thereby forcing the Authorities to close down
the System to check the suitcases for explosive devices. Apparently the
inside of the cases will bear the message, "Return to John Ashcroft."

I suspect many more ideas are floating around. I would love to hear them -
unless timing and revelation requires staying strategically mute.
Best bet might be - particularly if the Iraq soccer team wins a "gold" - to
get its members to march at the forefront and speak at any and all
demonstrations against George Bush's nomination and this country's deadly
occupation of Iraq (as they already have in Sports Illustrated).

Under the radar of the Swift Boats, the Pentagon's pending attack on the
Najaf Shrine of Imam Ali seems to further the destiny of more Middle East
conflagration, let alone 'terrorist' revenge in this country & elsewhere.
Thank's George, Donny R, Wolfie, etc. - Crusaders, all, a 'good job'.

One can only cynically suspect that a businessman down in Texas is - as
quickly as possible - preparing a toy-line of Swift Boats to be 'launched'
in time for the Christmas market. Kerry's boat will not be featured.

'Swiftly', keep getting out the vote and putting whatever possible money
into getting these guys out.

Stephen et al.

Here is another funtastic piece of creative activism.

I am especially interested in this too. I organized a poety
reading at the large anti-ftaa demos in Quebec City in 2001 called the
Free Verse Area of the Americas. The fellow who actually booked the venue
got shot in the leg with a tear gas canister (they fired the equivalent of
a canister a minute for 72 hours) so I didn't even meet him until the day
after in a Green chill-out zone.

My favorite for the RNC has to be the guy with the satellite hook-up onhis
bike where you can beam him antibush e-mails that will activate a nozzle
that will paint -in ecofriendly chalk- the pavemnet. The bike then takes a
digisnap of said new graffito and mounts in on a web site. fucking
brilliant.

or the crowd that  launched a banner IN central station last wednesday
with many little helium balloons. NO. War. Bush Lies. I believe it said.
Commuters reportedly applauded.

I've signed up for a NoRNC list to get ideas for actions here. The have
even posted job ads for catering staff for convention functions. two can
play at the agent provocateur game.

if i had the coin i'd take my mask and goggles down off the wall and head
for the big apple.

Pompadour-and-Guitar Bloc Celebrates Johnny Cash’s Legacy at the RNC!
By Kirsten Anderberg (www.kirstenanderberg.com)

Erin Siegal, aka Rine, was listening to Johnny Cash while checking her
email a while ago, when she read a post from RNCnotwelcome.org about an
event planned to take place during the Republican National Convention
(RNC) being held in New York City at the end of August. The event, being
held for RNC delegates, is to take place at Southeby’s, and will be in
honor of Johnny Cash. The event is sponsored by the American Gas
Association (http://www.aga.org), a multinational corporation whose
membership includes gas companies in Brazil, Korea, and France, among
others. Erin says, “It made me really sad…When it was announced that
Johnny Cash’s name would be tied to the 2004 RNC, my blood boiled. It was
just too offensive, too outrageous…Johnny Cash is a people’s hero.” So,
acting like any reasonable activist would, she organized a
Man-And-Woman-In-Black Bloc ()http://www.defendjohnycash.org) , to protest
outside the Southeby’s event on August 31 at 4 pm, to defend Johnny’s good
name.

Erin said when she talked to people initially about the Man-In-Black Bloc
idea, she got a very positive response. I asked if this was a grassroots
movement (tongue and cheek), and Erin responded it was a “concrete-cement
movement.” “I hesitate to even call this a grassroots protest - there
isn’t a whole lot of grass in NYC and Brooklyn…It stems from the concrete
resistance we hold in our hearts to the defamation of the memory of Johnny
Cash. We’re passionate. We won’t let the G.O.P get away with this. From
the cement of the sidewalk up, we’re painting and talking and doing
everything we can to let people know about this. The city is with us; we
just have an enormous responsibility to let everyone know.” “Rising up to
defend the honor of Johnny Cash,” people are asked to show up to
peacefully protest out front of Southeby’s, wearing black clothing and
pompadours, with real or cardboard guitars, hair grease, jailstripes,
Johnny posters and records, and posters of your favorite of Johnny’s
lyrics printed as big as possible. I asked how they were organizing this
protest, and she said they were putting up flyers, passing the word along
via word of mouth, contacting unions and Johnny Cash fan websites, sending
out press releases to media, etc. They need help flyering now, they
printed up 4,000 fliers. If you can help put up flyers, contact
maninblack@riseup.net.

Their poster says, ““NO CASH FOR THE RICH. Johnny, we won’t let the greedy
war-hungry Republicans exploit your memory by throwing a party affiliated
with your good name.” Their platform is clear: “Johnny Cash spoke for the
poor and under-represented. The Republicans speak for the rich. Johnny
Cash advanced for prison reform. The Republicans lock us up. Johnny Cash
sang for our miners, farmers, and workers. Republican economics crush the
working class. The RNC has no right to tarnish the memory of Johnny Cash.
We will rise up to defend the honor of an American hero.” The promo for
the Pompadour-And-Guitar Bloc goes on, “The songs of Johnny Cash were
beacons of light for those who were unjustly locked up, kicked down, and
knocked around. He sang for the poor, the imprisoned, and the oppressed.
He sang from his heart. How dare the Republicans think of using the memory
of a true people's hero to promote their greedy causes and war-criminal
president? Would Johnny support the president’s economic policies? NO!
Would Johnny support the Iraq war? NO! Would Johnny support the draconian
Rockefeller drug laws? HELL NO!” Their poster and website display the
classic Johnny Cash giving the finger picture. And I think the
Man-and-Woman-In-Black bloc would do that finger some justice.

“I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, Livin' in the
hopeless, hungry side of town,
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, But is there
because he's a victim of the times...
Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose, In our streak of lightnin'
cars and fancy clothes,
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,Up front there
ought 'a be a Man In Black…
I wear it for the sick and lonely old, For the reckless ones whose bad
trip left them cold,
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been, Each week
we lose a hundred fine young men…” - Johnny Cash

Erin said her cousin just got home from being stationed in the Middle East
on military duty. And she found Johnny’s lyrics about the Vietnam War to
be as relevant now, as they were when Cash wrote them. Cash sings: “I wear
the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been, each week we
lose a hundred fine young men, And, I wear it for the thousands who have
died, believen' that the Lord was on their side, I wear it for another
hundred thousand who have died, believen' that we all were on their side.”
– Johnny Cash

Can we expect to see bands of roving Pompadour-And-Guitar Blocs at more
protests in the future, such as anti-war and free trade protests? I sure
hope so. We need more of that. We need to see Men-And-Women-In-Black Blocs
showing up at all protests, something like the Radical Cheerleaders and
Infernal Noise Brigade. Not only is it fun for the participants, as well
as the media, and observers, it is also pertinent and very serious in
nature, really. Johnny Cash had a really serious political message. He
understood poverty. He understood prison. He understood the working
people. He is a good beacon for protest activity. And he also was really
funny. Which is why this bloc has so much potential. Because Johnny Cash,
himself, was so funny, intense, political, and honest. The bloc has
endless material to work with.

Well, there's things that never will be right I know, And things need
changin' everywhere you go,
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,You'll never
see me wear a suit of white.
Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day, And tell the world that
everything's OK,
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back, 'Till things are
brighter, I'm the Man In Black. -Johnny Cash

(Editor’s note: Southeby’s is located at 1334 York Avenue, NY, NY. It is
located one block east of 1st Avenue at 71st street. To take the subway,
take 6 train to 68th St. and walk north 3 blocks, and then east to York
Ave.)

Origin of Poetry

First the owner George Steinbrenner (sp) came to mind.
I couldn't remember the name of the manager.
I tried and tried and thought, if I didn't want to remember it, I would.
Over and over again, and then a rhythm came to my mind.
It was dah dah di, dah dah di.
I knew it was connected with the name.
Joe Torre (sp) or Torres (sp), that was the name I was thinking of.
But first, it was the incantation, dah dah di, that rhythm.
The rhythm appeared before the name, incantatory.
I thought this is similar to the condition of pausological constructs.
For example, "This is what I wanted to do, but {pause} ...".
The pause is _after_ the conjunction.
The structure is _already_ fulfilled.
It's the same with incantation, the structure is there.
(The structure which is _always_ there beforehand.)
Or rhyme, the structure is there. Alliteration.
But the incantatory preceded the name, the name a singularity.
Connected with the choratic rhythm of the body.
Disconnected momentarily with the name.
Establishing the rhythm of the name.
Establishing the name as a placeholder of the name.
A placeholder of the name that was generated by the name.
Or generated by the sound or the rigid designator of structure.
Rigid designator of structure and placeholder intertwined.
The intermeshing of primordial impulse.
Primordial in the sense of gesture and incantatory gesture.
Incantation is gesture, gesture incantation.
Every word tends towards others of its kind.
Poetry of incantation, weight of language, predecessor of name.
The _moment_ of the name in incantation.
The _call_ of Joe Torre (sp) in the primordial rhythm of the name.
The _sounding_ of Joe Torre and the world.

For Saint Thomas Merton the Teacher
The secret of Revelations can only be understood through the context of the
book within which it is given & passed down through the ages. Its wisdom
provokes fear in the most blessed of people, but when weighed against the
entire book it becomes apparently clear & possibly understood that the bible
is as much a book of wisdom as it is a series of contradictions designed
first with the Council of Nicea, to educate the ages. Education in the
spiritual context is not meant to frighten our children into the submission
of God, rather it is meant to keep them on the path of faith through the
fear of eternal damnation. In this sense, no part or piece of the Bible is
meant to destroy or build anything but the institution that it builds (even
the most hierarchical of systems). Instead, through patience & prayer, the
church finds illumination in the gospels & the collective truth of the
bible. From that point it then spreads “the good news” to its followers who
in turn are told to give that love (that divine love often called agape) to
its followers. Behind the closed mouth of the clergy could be 1,000 secrets
that would shake any scholar who did not enter into its vaults without the
proper faith. The proper faith is always the faith of childhood, the faith
in mother & father & most importantly family. I would define true wisdom as
the ability to see that within this context all war begins & all wars may
often find there ending. If we are to consider that Revelations is a
metaphorical call to arms, then that call to arms could have significance
that would shake the world to its foundations & which could in & of itself
trigger an end to humanity. In our current global situation, the primary
threat to humanity is chain of events that could participate in a nuclear
holocaust. The wisdom of Revelations tells us that the end of humanity will
bare the sign of  “biblical fire.” Often one cannot distinguish how ancient
knowledge would be important & necessary for all ages. In this sense, the
prophesy of biblical fire could very well mean the destructive possibility
of three things. The first could be the destruction of faith itself, the
second could be the destruction of the environment, & the third could be the
destruction of the sacred. All of these events would not necessarily happen
in a vacuum (so to speak) they would happen through the normal facets of
human activity. Mass communication, the contest between perspective world
religions, & the devaluation of life itself have led to a unique moment in
history. Children find themselves facing a world of unbearable violence in
which the decision of a true & lasting “holy war” could lead them to a state
of continuous warfare. Wade in my imagination for a bit… Currently the most
unstable country in the world is in fact Pakistan. This country had at one
point a lasting western style democracy & has since fallen into the hands of
a military dictatorship. Furthermore, its leader finds himself in the most
precarious of situations. He is home to the most infamous man in the world,
Osama Bin Laden, & is also the prime target of the Al-Queda Network. If the
infamous man is not found & publicly destroyed as a “blasphemer” then his
“call to arms” the ancient word “Jihad” will continue to serve as the
Christian equivalent of Revelations. If he is killed merely for show, then
his call to arms could actually lead to the war anyways. Either way, that
man’s call is in fact an act of his perspective faith. Some would have us
believe these sorts of conflicts may be purely the result of polluted
politics. Unfortunately, as Revelations explains, holy wars evolve more
sophisticated than one person could ever understand. Polar opposites could
unite in a call for destruction, only to find themselves demonized,
ostracized, & finally killed purely for following the path to a temporary
destruction. Let me explain briefly my perspective on Government. Government
serves the people, however, the people may not always be served by the
government. In a secular society, especially a non-tolerant society such as
the United States, in an attempt to create short term success (in Iraq as it
is in the world), governments could become so blind to the realities of
religious figures that a collective plea to stop might not warrant a moment
of wisdom or enlightenment. In this context, war opens the way to the
desecration of holy sites (which are after all, only symbols of the ties
between humanity & faith). Innocents could be forced to bare the weight of
deep & lasting scares that have no significance on their daily life, but
which could bare repercussions for generations to come. One man’s temple
might be defended with Nuclear weapons, while another man leaves his temple
unlocked at all times. Opposites have a tendency to unite in the common
faith of all life & that is life above all other facets. If the United
States does not learn a deep & lasting tolerance, then it could be Babylon
(not Iraq). Thank you for your time,
Ian VanHeusen
PS. Long live the intifida! Free tibet Free palestine but most importantly
free yourself

hilosophical musings, theoretical babble, Aussie vernacular - delivered a=
t a superhuman velocity that transforms sentences into melodic lines, blu=
rring the distinction between "reading" and "singing." You can't understa=
nd a word he says, but it sounds great. Much like opera. Only much, much =
faster.

A founding member of the improvised music/word group Machine for Making S=
ense, Mann's texts have been deconstructed, interpreted, and set by admir=
ing artists such as Thomas Buckner, John Cage, David Dunn, Gary Hill, Ann=
ea Lockwood, Larry Polansky, Robert Rauschenberg, and Karlheinz Stockhaus=
en. His recordings have been released by Lovely Music, Frog Peak, Nonsequ=
itur, and others.

(NOTE: Chris Mann will also perform an "electronic" version of the same w=
ork on Friday, September 3 at 8:00 PM, at Jack Straw Foundation. Mann wil=
l perform using a live computer system that chops his speech into tiny ph=
onemes and scatters them around the room via an 8-speaker array. He'll be=
 presenting "The Plato Songs.")

"As 'law' was also the word for 'music,' Plato's The Laws was, like the l=
ost sixth analect of Confucius, his text on music. And as The Laws was th=
e out-of-town tryout for The Republic, it seems timely to pry into those =
early models of conversation theory, the cybernetics of The Dialogues."

In case =AD in lieu of the fog of Sinking, Lying Boats =AD one needs to be
reminded of the Iraq/Bush & Company absolute disaster in detail, this is
good, informed acerbic reading:

WITH TREMBLING FINGERS

By Hal Crowther=20

(Hal Crowther is a former writer for Time and Newsweek, the Buffalo News,
and the North Carolina Spectator before parking his column at the weekly
Independent in Durham, N.C., and The Progressive Populist, among others. In
2002 he was a finalist for the National Magazine Award in Commentary. He wo=
n
the H.L. Mencken Award for column writing in 1992.)

I used to take a drink on occasion with a network newsman famed for his
impenetrable calm -- his apparent pulse rate that of a large mammal in deep
hibernation -- and in an avuncular moment he advised me that I'd do all
right, in the long run, if I could only avoid the kind of journalism
committed to the keyboard "with trembling fingers." I recognized the wisdom
of this advice and endeavored over the years to write as little as possible
when my blood pressure was soaring and my face was streaked with tears. The
lava flows of indignation ebb predictably with age and hardening arteries,
and nearing threescore I thought I'd never have to take another tranquilize=
r
-- or a double bourbon -- to keep my fingers steady on the keys.

I never imagined 2004. It would be sophomoric to say that there was never a
worse year to be an American. My own memory preserves the dread summer of
1968. My parents suffered the consequences of 1941 and 1929, and my
grandfather Jack Allen, who lived through all those dark years, might have
added 1918, with the flu epidemic and the Great War in France that each
failed, very narrowly, to kill him. Drop back another generation or two and
we encounter 1861.=20

But if this is not the worst year yet to be an American, it's the worst yea=
r
by far to be one of those hag-ridden wretches who comment on the American
scene. The columnist who trades in snide one-liners flounders like a stupid
comic with a tired audience; TV comedians and talk-show hosts who try to
treat 2004 like any zany election year have become grotesque, almost
loathsome. Our most serious, responsible newspaper columnists are so stunne=
d
by the disaster in Iraq that they've begun to quote poetry by Rupert Brooke
and Wilfred Owen. They lower their voices; they sound like Army chaplains
delivering eulogies over ranks of flag-draped coffins, under a hard rain
from an iron sky.=20

Yeats' "blood-dimmed tide is loosed." The war news has already deteriorated
from bad to tragic to pre-apocalyptic, which leaves no suitable category fo=
r
these excruciating reports on the sexual torture of Iraqi prisoners.
Fingers, be still. In less than a year, the morale of the occupying forces
has sunk so low that murder, suicide, rape and sexual harassment have becom=
e
alarming statistics, and now the warriors of democracy -- the emissaries of
civilization -- stand accused of every crime this side of cannibalism.
Osama bin Laden has always anathematized America's culture, as well as its
geopolitical influence. To him these atrocities are a sign of Allah's
certain favor, a great moral victory, a vindication of his deepest anger an=
d
darkest crimes.=20

Where does it go from here? The nightmare misadventure in Iraq is over,
beyond the reach of any reasonable argument, though many more body bags wil=
l
be filled. In Washington, chicken hawks will still be squawking about
"digging in" and winning, but Vietnam proved conclusively that no modern wa=
r
of occupation will ever be won. (Vietnam clip) Every occupation is doomed.
The only way you "win" a war of occupation is the old-fashioned way, the wa=
y
Rome finally defeated the Carthaginians: kill all the fighters, enslave
everyone else, raze the cities and sow the fields with salt.

Otherwise the occupied people will fight you to the last peasant, and why
shouldn't they? If our presidential election fails to dislodge the crazy
bastards who annexed Baghdad, many of us in this country would welcome
regime change by any intervention, human or divine. But if, say, the Chines=
e
came in to rescue us -- Operation American Freedom -- how long would any of
us, left-wing or right, put up with an occupying army teaching us
Chinese-style democracy? A guerrilla who opposes an invading army on his ow=
n
soil is not a terrorist, he's a resistance fighter. In Iraq we're not
fighting enemies but making enemies. As Richard Clarke and others have
observed, every dollar, bullet and American life that we spend in Iraq is
one that's not being spent in the war on terrorism. Every Iraqi, every
Muslim we kill or torture or humiliate is a precious shot of adrenaline for
Osama and al Qaeda.

The irreducible truth is that the invasion of Iraq was the worst blunder,
the most staggering miscarriage of judgment, the most fateful, egregious,
deceitful abuse of power in the history of American foreign policy. If you
don't believe it yet, just keep watching. Apologists strain to dismiss
parallels with Vietnam, but the similarities are stunning. In every action
our soldiers kill innocent civilians, and in every other action apparent
innocents kill our soldiers -- and there's never any way to sort them out.
And now these acts of subhuman sadism, these little My Lais.

Since the defining moment of the Bush presidency, the preposterous
flight-suit, Fox News-produced photo-op on the USS Abraham Lincoln in front
of the banner that read "Mission Accomplished," the shaming truth is that
everything has gone wrong. Just as it was bound to go wrong, as many of us
predicted it would go wrong -- if anything, more hopelessly wrong than any
of us would have dared to prophesy. Iraq is an epic train wreck, and there'=
s
not a single American citizen who's going to walk away unscathed. The shame
of this truth, of such a failure and so much deceit exposed, would have
brought on mass resignations or votes of no confidence in any free country
in the world. In Japan not long ago, there would have been ritual suicides,
shamed officials disemboweling themselves with samurai swords. Yet up to
this point -- at least to the point where we see grinning soldiers taking
pictures of each other over piles of naked Iraqis -- neither the president,
the vice president nor any of the individuals who urged and designed this
debacle have resigned or been terminated -- or even apologized. They have
betrayed no familiarity with the concept of shame.

Thousands of young Americans are dead, maimed or mutilated, billions of
dollars have been wasted and all we've gained is a billion new enemies and =
a
mouthful of dust -- of sand. Chaos reigns, but in the midst of it we have
this presidential election. George Bush has defined himself as a war
president, and it's fitting that the war should be his undoing. But even no=
w
the damned polls don't guarantee, or even indicate, his demise. Conventiona=
l
wisdom says that an incumbent president with a $200 million war chest canno=
t
be defeated, and that one who commands a live, bleeding, suffering army in
the field is doubly invincible. By this logic, the most destructively
incompetent president since Andrew Johnson will be rewarded with a second
term. That would probably mean a military draft and more wars in the oil
countries, and, under visionaries like Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz, a
chance for the USA to emulate 19th-century Paraguay, which simultaneously
declared war on Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay and fought ferociously until
90% of the male population was dead.

What hope then? Impeachment is impossible when the president's party
controls both houses of Congress, though Watergate conspirator John Dean,
who ought to know, claims in his new book that there are compelling legal
arguments for a half dozen bills of impeachment against George W. Bush. Pee=
r
pressure? At the White House, world opinion gets no more respect than FBI
memos or uncomfortable facts. Many Americans seem unaware that scarcely
anyone on the planet Earth supported the Iraq adventure, no one anywhere
except the 40-50 million Republican loyalists who voted for George Bush in
2000.=20

Among significant world leaders he recruited only Great Britain's Tony Blai=
r
-- whose career may be ruined because most Britons disagree with him -- and
the abominable Ariel Sharon, that vile tub of blood and corruption who
recently used air-to-ground missiles to assassinate a paraplegic in a
wheelchair at the door of his mosque. (Palestinians quickly squandered any
sympathy or moral advantage they gained from this atrocity by strapping a
retarded 16-year-old into a suicide bomber's kit. Such is the condition of
the human race in the Middle East, variously known as the Holy Land or the
Cradle of Civilization.) Says Sharon, oleaginously, of Bush: "Something in
his soul committed him to act with great courage against world terror."

The rest of the known world, along with the United Nations, has been dead
set against us from the start. But they carry no weight. Thanks to our tax
dollars and the well-fed, strong but not bulletproof bodies of our children
-- though mostly children from lower-income families -- George Bush and his
lethal team of oil pirates, Cold Warriors and Likudists commands the most
formidable military machine on earth. No nation, with the possible exceptio=
n
of China, would ever dare to oppose them directly.

But the Chinese aren't coming to save us. Nothing and no one can stop these
people except you and me, and the other 100 million or so American citizens
who may vote in the November election. This isn't your conventional
election, the usual dim-witted, media-managed Mister America contest where
candidates vie for charm and style points and hire image coaches to help
them act more confident and presidential. This is a referendum on what is
arguably the most dismal performance by any incumbent president -- and
inarguably the biggest mistake. This is a referendum on George W. Bush,
arguably the worst thing that has happened to the United States of America
since the invention of the cathode ray tube.

One problem with this referendum is that the case against George Bush is
much too strong. Just to spell it out is to sound like a bitter partisan. I
sit here on the 67th birthday of Saddam Hussein facing a haystack of
incriminating evidence that comes almost to my armpit. What matters most,
what signifies? Journalists used to look for the smoking gun, but this time
we have the cannons of Waterloo, we have Gettysburg and Sevastopol, we have
enough gunsmoke to cause asthma in heaven. I'm overwhelmed. Maybe I should
light a match to this mountain of paper and immolate myself. On the near
side of my haystack, among hundreds of quotes circled and statistic
sunderlined, just one thing leaped out at me. A quote I had underlined was
from the testimony of Hermann Goering at the Nuremberg trials, not long
before Hitler's vice-fuhrer poisoned himself in his jail cell: "... It is
always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy, or a
fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice o=
r
no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.
This is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and
denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to
danger. It works the same in every country."

Goering's dark wisdom gained weight when a friend called me and reported
that Vice President Cheney was so violently partisan in his commencement
speech at Westminster College in Missouri -- so rabid in his attacks on Joh=
n
Kerry as a anti-American peace-marching crypto-communist -- that the colleg=
e
president felt obliged to send the student body an email apologizing for
Cheney's coarseness.

If you think it's exceptionally shameless for a man who dodged Vietnam to
play the patriot card against a decorated veteran, remember that Georgia
Republicans played the same card, successfully, against Sen. Max Cleland,
who suffered multiple amputations in Vietnam. In 2001 and 2002, George Bush
and his Machiavelli, Karl Rove, approved political attack ads that showed
the faces of Tom Daschle and other Democratic senators alongside the faces
of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. And somewhere in hell, Goering and
Goebbels toasted each other with a schnapps.

Am I polarized? I've never been a registered Democrat, I'm sick of this
two-party straitjacket, I wish to God it didn't take Yale and a major
American fortune to create a presidential candidate. The only current
Democratic leaders who show me any courage are Nancy Pelosi and old Bob Byr=
d
-- Hillary Clinton has been especially cagy and gutless on this war -- and
John Kerry himself may leave a lot to be desired. He deserves your vote not
because of anything he ever did or promises to do, but simply because he di=
d
not make this sick mess in Iraq and owes no allegiance to the sinister
characters who designed it. And because his own "place in history," so
important to the kind of men who run for president, would now rest entirely
on his success in getting us out of it.

Kerry made a courageous choice at least once in his life, when he came home
with his ribbons and demonstrated against the war in Vietnam. But Sen. Kerr=
y
could turn out to be a stiff, a punk, an alcoholic, and he'd still be a
colossal improvement over the man who turned Paul Wolfowitz loose in the
Middle East. The myth that there was no real difference between Democrats
and Republicans, which I once considered seriously and which Ralph Nader
rode to national disaster four years ago, was shattered forever the day
George Bush announced his cabinet and his appointments for the Department o=
f
Defense.=20

I'm aware that there are voters -- 40 million? -- who don't see it this way=
.
I come from a family of veterans and commissioned officers; I understand
patriots in wartime. If a spotted hyena stepped out of Air Force One wearin=
g
a baby-blue necktie, most Americans would salute and sing "Hail to the
Chief." President Bush cultivated his patriots by spending $46 million on
media in the month of March alone. Somehow I'm on his mailing list. (Is tha=
t
because my late father, with the same name, was a registered

Republican, or can Bush afford to mail his picture to every American with a=
n
established address?) Twice a week I open an appeal for cash to crush John
Kerry and the quisling liberal conspiracy, and now I own six gorgeous color
photographs of the president and his wife. I'm sure some of my neighbors
frame the president's color photographs and fill those little blue envelope=
s
he sends us with their hard-earned dollars.

I struggle against the suspicion that so many of my fellow Americans are
conceptually challenged. I want to reason with my neighbors; I want to
engage these lost Americans. What makes you angry, neighbor? What arouses
your suspicions? Does it bother you that this administration made terrorism
a low priority, dismissed key intelligence that might have prevented the
9/11 catastrophe, then exploited it to justify the preplanned destruction o=
f
Saddam Hussein, who had nothing to do with al Qaeda? All this is no longer
conjecture, but direct reportage from cabinet-level meetings by the turncoa=
t
insiders Richard Clarke and Paul O'Neill.

If the Pentagon ever thought Saddam had "weapons of mass destruction," it
was only because the Pentagon gave them to him. As Kevin Phillips recounts
in American Dynasty, officials of the Reagan and first Bush administrations
eagerly supplied Saddam with arms while he was using chemical weapons on th=
e
Kurds. They twice sent Donald Rumsfeld to court Saddam, in 1983 and 1984,
when the dictator was in the glorious prime of his monsterhood.

This scandal, concurrent with Iran-Contra, was briefly called "Iraqgate,"
and, yes, among the names of those officials implicated you'll find most of
the engineers of our current foreign policy. (They also signaled their
fractious client, Saddam, that it might be all right to overrun part of
Kuwait; you remember what happened when he tried to swallow it all.) Does
any of this trouble you? Does it worry you that Dick Cheney, as president o=
f
the nefarious Halliburton Corporation, sold Iraq $73 million in oilfield
services between 1997 and 2000, even as he plotted with the Wolfowitz
faction to whack Saddam? Or that Halliburton, with its CEO's seat still war=
m
from Cheney's butt, was awarded unbid contracts worth up to $15 billion for
the Iraq invasion, and currently earns a billion dollars a month from this
bloody disaster? Not to mention its $27.4 billion overcharge for our
soldiers' food.=20

These are facts, not partisan rhetoric. Do any of them even make you
restless? The cynical game these shape-shifters have been playing in the
Middle East is too Byzantine to unravel in 1,000 pages of text. But the
hypocrisy of the White House is palpable, and beggars belief. If there's on=
e
American who actually believes that Operation Iraqi Freedom was about
democracy for the poor Iraqis, then you, my friend, are too dangerously
stupid to be allowed near a voting booth.

Does it bother you even a little that the personal fortunes of all four Bus=
h
brothers, including the president and the governor, were acquired about a
half step ahead of the district attorney, and that the royal family of Saud=
i
Arabia invested $1.476 billion in those and other Bush family enterprises?
Or, as Paul Krugman points out, that it's much easier to establish links
between the Bush and bin Laden families than any between the bin Ladens and
Saddam Hussein. Do you know about Ahmad Chalabi, the administration's
favorite Iraqi and current agent in Baghdad, whose personal fortune was
established when he embezzled several hundred million from his own bank in
Jordan and fled to London to avoid 22 years at hard labor? That's just a
sampling from my haystack. Maybe I can reach you as an environmentalist, on=
e
who resents the gutting of key provisions in the Clean Air Act? My own
Orange County, N.C., chiefly a rural area, was recently added to a national
register of counties with dangerously polluted air. You say you vote for th=
e
president because you're a conservative. Are you sure? I thought
conservatives believed in civil liberties, a weak federal executive, an
inviolable Constitution, a balanced budget and an isolationist foreign
policy. George Bush has an attorney general who drives the ACLU apoplectic
and a vice president who demands more executive privilege (for his energy
s=E9ances ) than any elected official has ever received. The president wants =
a
Constitutional amendment to protect marriage from homosexuals, of all
things. Between tax cuts for his high-end supporters and three years playin=
g
God and Caesar in the Middle East, George Bush has simply emptied America's
wallet with a $480 billion federal deficit projected for 2004 and the tab o=
n
Iraq well over $100 billion and running.

"A lot of so-called conservatives today don't know what the word means,"
Barry Goldwater said in 1994, when the current cult of right-wing radicals
and "neocons" had begun to define and assert themselves. Goldwater was my
first political hero, before I was old enough to read his flaws. But his wa=
s
the conservatism of the wolf -- the lone wolf -- and this is the
conservatism of sheep.

All it takes to make a Bush conservative is a few slogans from talk radio
and pickup truck bumpers, a sneer at "liberals" and maybe a name-dropping
nod to Edmund Burke or John Locke, whom most of them have never read.  Shee=
p
and sheep only could be herded by a ludicrous but not harmless cretin like
Rush Limbaugh, who has just compared the sexual abuse of Iraqi prisoners to
"a college fraternity prank" (and who once called Chelsea Clinton "the
family dog" -- you don't have to worry about shame when you have no brain).=
.

I don't think it's accurate to describe America as polarized between
Democrats and Republicans, or between liberals and conservatives. It's
polarized between the people who believe George Bush and the people who do
not. Thanks to some contested ballots in a state governed by the president'=
s
brother, a once-proud country has been delivered into the hands of liars,
thugs, bullies, fanatics and thieves. The world pities or despises us, even
as it fears us. What this election will test is the power of money and medi=
a
to fool us, to obscure the truth and alter the obvious, to hide a great
crime against the public trust under a blood-soaked flag. The most lavishly
funded, most cynical, most sophisticated political campaign in human histor=
y
will be out trolling for fools. I pray to God it doesn't catch you.

Alan,  In Halifax NS they're asking $157.88 for your "Structure of Reality"
and in Brewster NY a copy of "Individuals" is priced at $66.97.  I've
collected your publications for many years, and am rarely able to "scout"
them in person.  --  Barry Alpert

Subject:      San Francisco, the RNC, & August
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

It's curious - but repetitively normal - the way in which San Francisco, the
experience of living goes so mute in August. Perhaps more than most North
American and European Cities, San Francisco is taken way down by the fog.
Though today is wonderfully blue and warm, the Twain cliche about "August in
San Francisco being the coldest winter I ever spent" remains tangibly true.
It is also tangibly true in the brown grasses that deaden the hills. It's a
time in which -barring getting out of town - that flattens the psyche,
eliminates the ego, taunts any aspiration; it's bottom of the ocean time.
Keep breathing and wait for the September lift.

Well that's it on one, personal level. The other level is national. There is
a deep - I sense - deep collective apprehension of what will happen in New
York next week, the site of the Republican convention. Tens or hundreds of
thousands of demonstrators are on their way to cement a fluid and tenacious
opposition to the Bush Administration. The Courts have denied Central Park
as a place of public demonstration. It looks like a Republican Party set-up
to create anarchy and mayhem that can be exploited. Fox and the other cable
Networks cannot wait to show images of violence - Cop confrontations,
shattered windows,  etc. - as a demonstration of how peaceful and proper
Republicans are "at heart and in principle".  Equally pernicious is the
Administration's attempt to cloak New York with the fear of another
terrorist attack. The Public is left in the middle of anticipating a
Collective cauldron that could backfire in the favor of this hopelessly
inept, corrupt Administration. More than inept, an Administration that is an
ideological disaster with nothing but destructive consequences both domestic
and international. The details are obvious and deeply saddening.
Yet, as one who cannot go to New York, one waits with this stultifying
apprehension that Bush & Co. will wrench events into their electoral favor.
Probably no proverbial light here in August, but definitely a storm. As WCW
finished his preface to Howl "...we are going through Hell."
I sense in my bones that's true

Subject: [noRNC] official Republican national convention events list aug
    28-september 3

First and foremost, big thanks to the many people who have taken the time
to share this information with us. New Yorkers are the best. Thanks for
listening, typing them up and sending them in. Here is the list of
official, unpublished, Republican National Convention events.

These events have been sent to us by many New Yorkers who are opposed to
the Republican National Conmvention. They have sent us emails and called
our voice mail with information about Republican events often expressing
support for the protests and giving unpublished event information.

This is a clear expression of the situation in NYC right now. <a
href="http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/news/gopcon/wabc_gopcon_080804_pollworries.html">83%
of New Yorkers are opposed to the RNC coming to our town.</a> People have
done what they can to support the resistance here and this accumulated
information is indicative of that.

Use this information as you see fit. We are not suggesting anything other
than that you take action. Lets show the Republicans what we think of
their convention. These parties which are essentially little fundraisers
for local business elites are a great opportunity to express to the
Republicans what you think of their agenda.

thanks,

I have also moved, so please don't send another if you've already sent one, it might show up by postal forwarding.  Please do let me know though if my subscription has run out.  i'll gladly renew.

They hang the man and flog the woman
That steal the goose from off the common,
But let the greater villain loose
That steals the common from the goose.

".....at a time when I am speaking to you about the paradox of desire -- in
the
sense that different goods obscure it -- you can hear outside the awful
language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

dawgs is/was/will foeva live in Tek.
Tek taught Army how to read. He still moves his mouth when he goes to
sound it out. En sometimes he say it aloud -- maybe, the whole sentence,
on the bus or at his crib. But it comes off as beautiful, cuz some
things where meant to be spit out loud. Army pushes his head into the
pages. The homey get ri in there wiph the words. It like he fix on
playin a game or somethin. ...en he moves his mouth en he make a phat
sound en breakdown the vowels into words en work the sentence (s).

They jackt Wiggy’s daddy at his crib in Hillside en beat Wiggy silly.
Tek had to pull him out off from rapin the daddy too. Wiggy’s daddy was

train at the Holiday court on this bitch they had to beatdown for tryin
to jack them for a couple of spits which they got off a stunt at Wiggy’s
crib.
Army chased her from right down Douglas, through Micky D’s, en all round
parkinlots. He gat her good, though. Punched her out en tried to get his
grip back but she wouldn’t give. This bitch was bloody en feenin. Yaeh,
she got away, again -- gainst the chutzpah of the chillum of Goodman.
But he gave chase again en beat her down again en he knew where she was
headin so he dropt back en waited to cut her off at the pass.
Tek had been waitin ahead in the lot jus at the Bank cross Me from the,
woht the Colonist called, “gritty Holiday Court”. Woht a joke. The kids
gotz Holiday Tee’s naw if you wont one.
Army got the room number en they crasht the room en Army got his grip en
she warn’t too unpretty, yet so they jammed her to keep her from forgettin.
-Let’s get bizzy, bitch-
Tek spunkt in her face en Army he ripped her snatch wiph his bozac.
Wiped the pussy blood en nut bust off on her face en bitch slapt her
bustin one of her tooth. He was shu of thét.
The bitch was a 15yr ol E-tard swangin over to crack. MAybe, it’ll teach
the bitch to clean her shit up.
-She fucin smell. Fuccin lil ho-
-Cha G’¡Ya!-
He said as they walked out the room.
Army was a pathological reflection. He had mad pain from his daddy’s
Long Mile MIA memories. Someone shot his daddy. He done know who it was.
So he gon hateon ‘em all. Cept for his waddys en uncle Harlo.
Victoria was jus another mark||
Army had his daddy Athalwolf’s Book of Judgements. His moms had given it
to him en he keep it safe like thét dank pipe en sblade thét his uncle
Harlo gave him after Army’s mom’s died of the monsta.
Did this song start wiph a cry?
Did My madkids in Hurley hats run too wyel?
They ain’t lost cuz they ain’t neva been chillen. So there ain’t nothin
to keep remainin in. But they can fly wiph or wiphout dust. They can
kick en do 720’s cali rollit, like thét kid, who can flip en drop on a
board steady from the Belfy rooftops. They gon do woht they gon do cuz
they no fear, yo. They stout heart until they let the humans steal their
heartz en make them notice colour en codes en cypher the world into a
flat narrow blind field of unreality. Then We watch dem break your legz
crack your back smash your arms drop you in the Gorge so the water take
you en you done comeback. Wayde through the Long Mile mess misdirected
vocal egomania come to play the Blues. No soul comes through from
wordstuck Colonist articles, Texas crime hacks en Britty law books
claimin the bangarang of wack Black/White theorist wiphout a clue.
Gorge, like Me en T.W., He remember the derembered woht got lost in His
flood. He got no pressure like I feel, from the light beat of lil feet
come to heavy sad/sad of poundin walks.
Ayo, y’see thét lil loc yo? Once he used to smile. Nah Army walk wiph
Virk en thems pain foeva eva. Cuz one mo lil gon in this city gon mean
en crazy.
Feel me.
Me.
Me is ussin.
You en Me Army.
Woht.

…en he looked like T.S. Eliot, round the age of 17 wearin that, on the
out, thriftshop, brown, snug fittin tweed suit en those govt., welly
wrangled, pair of glasses. Athalwolf was a smooth killa. He said that he
wonted to take a life. That he felt like it was his mood. Some say he
was a far kin of a halfbreed; Alex Hare--hung at 17 en a wicked little
sharp shot. Woht they say about the west, Athal was, partially. He bore
a rugged individualism, had conquest on his mind but cared less about
entertainin progress in his conscience, nor did he care much about law
en order, except when the predictable crash of paranoia set in en he
thought they might be after him.
His girl was a comely crack ho, soon goin on ugly, who he held up in the
Heroin Hotel wiph a screwed-up frenchman who watched porno 24/7 on 5
different sets. He was a mousy guy en road a 200/LX roadster right by
Athalwolf’s side, even through fights.
Athal’d sit wiph her on the balcony, over lookin the bad buildin tops en
smogged out mountains of the Olympic range, when she was too strung out.
“Can you hear Sam Cooke, baby? can hear Sam Cooke, on his best croonin
tracks, huh, baby, can you?” He’d tie his arms en legs around her en
talk about where they could go en how much money they could get for woht
they wonted. It was never about leavin this place or even gettin a new
room or turnin off the television, maybe even changin the fuccin channel
or gettin a new video.
She was still nuff pretty to be a good wife but she couldn’t come
through wiph barin any offspring. She’d been knocked up six times en
lost each one to miscarriage. She was hopin seven would be a charm.
Seven is what was good in Athal’s “Book Of Judgements” en way of life.
She wonted his baby. She had been passed up en down the Island en even
the mainland, in the circuit, to greet en please the locals wiph cash en
wives en stiff stupid friendlies feenin to bust. She was still nuff
pretty. Not too much of the west’s loneliness, hardwork en over fret
around cops, sammy bulls, bailers, blades, psychos en bully boyfriends,
was wearin her out. But, she was still pretty, in way. If you stood her
next to the girls who Hammet called better than pretty en who ate all
the meals that a daye could offer, you’d peep that she wasn’t up to
match. You’d be able to tell. All she had now, to compare her
countenance wiph, was what was crawlin from Wharf en endin up on Broad
for 20 bucks a head. Maybe, a head job, maybe, jus a talk to get more,
to score more, before even a lick was offered, which was why so many
ended up gettin beat down en tossed out trucks on quiet corners. She was
sure it was Athal’s baby, Yeah.

*****

He could get his dick sucked by a feggit for a couple of good whacks of
bogus scooby snacks. It was an admirable characteristic of the Long Mile
landscape he grew up to know. It was the body politics of the area. If
his girl, the frenchman, his chuck[L]heads en the chink en the stad
dealer from Duncan, where pirootin, cookin up rock en talkin chemistry
in the parlour; if he wonted to whack, in the bathroom, on a date wiph a
yack feg, who wonted to suck his sweet young dick, as he spoke dirty to
him, he’d peep his Book of Judgements, his guide to life, written in
fatty tipped marker, inna drawin book. He’d keep his eyeballs stranded
to {3: 7-13} the page of the daye, as it spoke to him en it en He would
say; “repent”:

“Repent from the followins of the spoilers.
You have turned away from Me en
have taken on the ways of the sinful.
You have known abominable ways
en eaten of the waste left of the spoiled land,
ingestin devastation’s en
whackin hatefulness into thyself.
You have taken to lay down wiph hos
en those of which not even a dog
would find fit to eat of at My command.”

-AAAaaaOOOOoooohhhhaaaFuc/bitch! I like you-

*****

Over on the outside, he’d take the frenchman out wiph him en a couple of
the bwoys en go drinkin. Top of thét , he’d do some deals for the Duncan
chink en the stad. Things could get pretty fuct up on a welly Wed. .They
come out from all over, which is why they’d send Athal out wiph the
bruisers. They were known to mess up a few suckers for not payin up or
gettin out of hand or jus because they read “nünheim” across their
forehead. They got jackt, real soso, off the free shit, that they got
from the Duncan stad en the chink, or skimmed off the top for the SMUs,
the Rockland boys, en them sorts, who came down en took cab rides or
drives or followed en waited across streets, of the lower parts, to get
them to pickup. But they couldn’t fuc wiph a chug who was on a bad high,
though. They was bad Injinns. Injinns are jus bad on any shit. They jus
got drunk en mouthy en couldn’t remember where they were en where they
were goin. They start seein things en think that they invincible like
they was inna ghost dance. There was no reasonin. One came to the apt en
stood outside the door wiph a big ‘ol knife en was screamin about cuttin
throats en runnin the bastards en the bitch cunt through.

..en one was hatin on Athal, naw.

Athal was makin a deal wiph this stad. The stad was gettin paranoid.
The chug was makin noise.
Athal had no intention of rippin this dude off.
Athal was jus a little fuct en was tryin to make the deal, like he
wasn’t, en so he was fuccin up en the chug kept talkin over him, wontin
to hedup, askin for all of this shit en sayin that he knew him. He kept
callin him a ‘cock sucker.’

*****

At crixmas Athal got his girl 6 turkey bagel sandwiches, that his
friend, Harlo, gave him, from the Bagel shop he cleaned up at. They
wouldn’t let Harlo work the cash, jus clean up. He asked once en they
said his face was dirty. He was a dude who slept on the beach, when he
got tossed out of his apt, by his girl. Some say, she was the sort of
chick, they evented the sport of bitch slappin for. She would look at
Athel en others like they jus shot her dog, burned down her house en
chased her family out of town. She took Harlo’s little puppy. It was
cute little guy. A tiny pittbull pup, that he’d freak over, if he got
puppy hiccups. Harlo laid out alot cash to get it dewarmed en haulin it
over to this Native chick, down the street, who took care of the pups
what belonged to the poor kids in the hood.
He lost the pup to his girl. She jus took it. He slept on beaches, got
hit on by old men, got a job cleanin up bagel shit en was told he had a
dirty face for it. But he got Athalwolf en his girl a crixmas turkey,
one way or another.

Harlo made it wiph Athal, once. He came to the bar en they were closin
up en the kitten at the counter wouldn’t serve him. He’d jus gotten paid
en had a load of cash on him--200, maybe. It was a load for this time of
the year. This was the closest place en he went in. It had a bitchy
bummedout emo cool to it; mobbed wiph white jazz suburbia ragers. Harlo
looked around en saw the usual paint tarps sittin at the other end bein
talked up by the mad trippin’ exjock from Nova Scotia. He’d bought the
place when he came over en thought he made it to the bigtime--Hali ain’t
nothin but a Block of downtown, here. From the time the TVs went on en
the beer started pourin, it was tongue oil suckin the life en hearts
from the drywallers en fadin football thugs. Their lives hung over the
vacuum of the stuff. The country had done them wrong: them, they had
took it--they not bein like them. ...en their faces failed en had fallen
ages ago into those glasses that they formed posses roun to keep en
remember splices of Dartmouth en Pictou, Penticton, Mission en Langford,
Chillwack, Creston en Caroline en nightmares tales of migrants, pakis en
slantyeyed gangs en Gottegen en them Africville dumbass coons who fetid
the place for all them. Athal was sittin behind them, hearin, noddin en
smirkin. Then his eyes flickered, reflectin off the teeny candle light
en yellow brown en stale brass. Him en his, they connected like they do.
Lost compadres, slow walkin from behind the blunderers, pass the
missers, cheers to the jock, nah, no, not takin off, jus sayin hi,
howzit goin, you got no beer, no drinks, can’t buy a fuccin thing, these
jointsers are bummedout. You jus borin. You got the same shirt everyday.
A’yo Athal, do you think you, can’t you, you know, you know where en
they decided to go on en get, go get some en then they got all eric
martin. Then they brought up some feelins, they’d stashed for awhile en
then--thing one en thing two en years back stories bout fus meetin en
thinkin about stupid stuff en then the makin silly wiph each other
happened. They never talked about it en for a bit Athal felt special en
Harlo always did. Harlo, he wasn’t like that. It was jus one of those
freak things, between friends. It jus was this thing.

*****

The frenchman then pulls up his roadster en starts to tell the guy to
‘come on’ en ‘get lost’ en ‘stop bodderin him.’ All the other of Athal’s
boys watched or tried to make deals across the street.
The stad says he’s got to go.

-No, no, wait, jus tell me how much you want, man. Come on lets’ take a
walk-
-No, I’m not takin a walk, dude. I’m outta here-

A lot of abi-originalz show up en they’re younger, wearin jerseys, en
nekgah wear. They think thét they ni@@erer than nekgaz, who they call
ni@@er. They got the ball caps en eurotrash slick back mohwaks tied into
ponytails. Say most, they always lookin for trouble en jackin shit. They
never got over the mess woht happened wiph Here Before Christ en their
avengin hoods like Dan McLean en J. Doug, (who they say, was not some
bit far from the beast, who shall rise in the form of man in preachers
clothin), blasted Tlel, a squaw, her baby en his uncle back in 1849.
High yella super shiesty -- Doug did shit to stop the rapes of native
lils en settlass landgrabs – poor Nigger Dan. But they really hated
ni@@ers, so much, they wonted to be one. So much, they acted like one,
without the ghetto, en only a reservation en all the video arcades,
welly en poison they got pumpt into their heads. You cyan say thét they
eva wonted to be a credit to their race.

-Hey feggit-

...is what they said. Athal never listened to that, when people said it,
because he knew that they weren’t talkin to him.

-A Yo feggit-

-Man, just tell me how much you want-

-An 8ball, fuk, ain’t you listenin-

-This dudes fuktup. This is a fukken heat score, man-

-Wait, you want game, right-

-A Yo, feggit-

-Right-

-Well, let’s take a walk. I don’t walk around with that on me, you know-

The Injinns move closer en the frenchman jus starts to move his roadster
back off down a ways.

-You’re a feggit-

-So let’s take a walk-

-Forget it. Come on, let’s get out of here-

-Yeah, well fuc you. FUC YOU! ...waste my fuccin time-

...en he turns to the chuggas en says;

-What the fuc do you want-

-Your ass, feggit-

...en they pull out a gun. What kind, nobody knew. Athal took a swing at
the fuc en it went flyin en hit the wall. He was, like he was, bein on
whiskey root en could care less, like usual, of becomin shot. His girl
came out of the truck she was in wiph a loser who had his dick out.
Athal gets a good swing in en bashes the punk chug to the pavement. He
was better than Hulk Hogan, better than Rodney even better than thét
Shamrock is, naw, before he got bought en sold out to make pretend
messes of people’s bodies. He was always good inna fight. He could have
joined the gym en had his face en body on those posters, they get up
around town, for real boxin en kick boxin events. He could have gotten
the deals on the tats, they gave the pugs, at the shop, jus alla. He
kicked the chugga on the ground, en it became a runnin battle, wiph him
en four Injinns. They had him backin up, swingin all left/right/
right/left combos, inna boxers attitude, the frenchman en his roadster
scootin on behind the pageant. His girl was screamin, jus right/lower,
for the streets, not to draw too many warders, despite the surveillance
cameras en the undercovers, but to give warnin en back to her man. He
took a good swing again en got another Injinn. Athal pulled off his
jacket en ripped his glasses off. His girl retrieved them all. He was
Injinn fightin like Cody. They made like Sittin Bull.

*****

It was jus a beer splattered tall wood, which was, basically, a
long/lanky twig that Harlo left a sixpack beside; clips from the
Judgements, a poem from the “Redzone”. If it had air en a little more
Sun it could have been fat as an oak. ...en the corner boys en their
bitches laid pretty wild picked en plastic flowers roun, along wiph,
some Hallmark cards en fooscap tacked to the trunk.

“we mis you”

“We allways love you”

“We cry a tear for you each day while your gone”



*****


-Woht?! fuc thét lil bitch, mayn. Fuccin chick, WOHT-

Army, mayn, he hated fish.

He rubbed the Woht. Kid. blood off his kicks in the alley next to the
cinema theatre on Johnson. More en the Poro legged it to Creamfist’s
parent’s crib. They chillout for the night if it was coo en his parents
were out again. Dang, they was drunk as fucc en blunted en dusted to
perfection.
Dust, the ulitmate crew drug.
Perfection. Roll.

The Americaness and Problem Positions


http://www.as.wvu.edu:8000/clc/Members/sondheim/americaness.mov

The Processor

The two paper tapes prepared on the perforator should agree. But whether
or not they agree, a girl takes them over to the processor and puts them
both in. The processor has two tape feeds, and she puts one tape on each
and starts the machine.

...

The Problem Positions

Next, the girl takes the punched tape made by the processor over to a
problem position that is idle. Two of the problem positions are always
busy guiding the two computers. The other two problem positions stand by,
ready to be loaded with problems.

(from Edmund C. Berkeley, Giant Brains or Machines that Think, 1949)

Three cheers to any traveling to New York for RNC or the UFPJ/NION march on
Sunday.
I suppose that goes to New Yorkers also, but not so much so. Perhaps I will
see some of you there, even though you probably won't know who I am and
vice-versa.

I personally am enduring SIXTEEN plus hours both ways via 15 person van . .
.to spend 24 hours there.
Waking at 5:45 and departing at 7. Such is the life of the poor, student
activist.

CONGRESS IS IN SECRET ATTEMPTING TO PASS BILLS
HR163 & S89 TO REINSTATE DRAFT AS EARLY AS SPRING
2005

Mandatory draft for boys and girls (ages 18-26) starting June 15, 2005,
is something that everyone should know about. This literally effects
everyone since we all have or know children that will have to go if this
bill passes.

There is pending legislation in the house and senate (twinbills: S89 and
HR 163) which will time the program's initiation so the draft can begin
as
early as spring, 2005, just after the 2004 presidential election. The
administration is quietly trying to get these bills passed now, while
the public's attention is on the elections, so our action on this is
needed
immediately. Details and links follow.

http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/quer

The above links will take you to a gov web site that describes the
provisions of the bill since Congress has been hesitating to pass
this bill into law because of the perceived possibility that bill
passage
would have an extremely negative effect on George W. Bush's
reelection campaign.

Send this now to all you know so this information becomes well known!

The viewer must go directly to this page (see link below)

after the page is brought up onscreen, the viewer must
type HR 163 into the blank box labeled "Bill number" on

Hi all,

The first year of our non-NY Small Press series--d.a. levy lives:
celebrating the renegade press--has gone real well. We were honored to
present readings from:

Meritage Press (San Francisco/St. Helena, Calif.),
The Owl Press (Woodacre, Calif.)
Avec Books (Penngrove, Calif.)
CyPress (Cincinnati, Ohio)
above/ground press (Ottawa, Canada)
Chax Press (Tucson, Arizona)
Carve (Boston)
Braincase Press (Northampton, Mass.)
Combo (Providence, Rhode Island)
Talon Books (Vancouver, British Columbia)

The readings are on the first Thursday of each month at ACA Galleries at 529
W.20th St., 5th Flr. (bet. 10th and 11th avenues) at 6:00 p.m., and usually
feature contributors from a press reading for 20-30 minutes and a musical
act performing for 15-20 minutes, a break, and then 20-30 minutes more of
readings and 15-20 minutes more of music.

The gallery operators are amazing folk and connected to the poetry community
in that they're the son-in-law and daughter of the poet Simon Perchik. They
provide wine and other beverages, cheese, and fruit for each reading, too.
Oh yeah, no door either.

I'm booking our second season now. The rest of 2004 we'll have events from
Conundrum (Chicago), Ambit (Baltimore), a 30th anniversary celebration for
Kelsey Street Press (Berkeley, Calif.), and The Poker (Boston).

We still need some presses for the period of January-July 2005. If you are
interested, please  backchannel me to editor@boogcity.com

thanks,
david

Here in Chicago on WGN Radio there is a great nighttime show called
Extension 720 with Professor Milt Rosenberg of the University of Chicago.
This show has art and book reviews and some of the most intelligent talk on
commercial radio. Last Thursday he did his twice yearly Poetry program.

One of his guests was Christian Wiman of "Poetry" Magazine and some other
poet who lives here in Chicago whose work is so banal that I almost fell
asleep driving home.  It was two hours of the most banal, boring poetry it
was like eating wonder bread drenched in velveeta. It was like a Saturday
Night Live skit that wanted to make poetry so boring and so irrelevant as to
be funny abd yet they were serious.

They spent 25 minutes on Gerard Manley Hopkins (Whom I do Like),20 minutes
on Phillip Larkin,it seemed like hours on Auden, a whole slew of Rhyming
poets there was no mention of Pound, Williams, Olson, Ginsberg, Black
Mountain, San Francisco Rennaissance, Spicer, Bernstein, Howe,Duncan,Ashbury
Creeley. You would think in a city like Chicago with the number of
experimental poets we have they could have got someone descent. There was
not a mention of Slam either and Chicago is the birthplace of that form even
if you dont like it it is a force here. The whole show could have been
recorded in 1950 not 2004.

Wiman even said that the great loss of late was the death of Donald Justice
and that he is so influential, have I missed something, I had Justice at
Iowa he is a nice man but influential? Anyway I thought it was interesting
and it showed the state of Poetry Magazine (The Republican Party Rhyming).

Why didn't Ruth Lilly submit to LANGUAGE and get rejected and then gave
millions to Charles Bernstein and Bruce Andrews?!!!!!!!!!!

Activist bike creator Joshua Kinberg arrested 8/28/2004  Current rating: 4

Bikesagainstbush creator Joshua Kinberg was arrested while taping an
interview with MSNBC's Ron Reagan in Manhattan Saturday afternoon.

Kinberg was stopped by police while demonstrating the bicycle for the
television interview. His bicycle is a high-tech graffiti writer, using
chalk to print anti-Bush political messages sent by people via the
internet. Apparently there was a question of whether or not the sprayed
messages were a defacement of property.

Bikesagainstbush creator Joshua Kinberg was arrested while taping an

Kinberg was stopped by police while demonstrating the bicycle for the
television interview. His bicycle is a high-tech graffiti writer, using
chalk to print anti-Bush political messages sent by people via the
internet. Apparently there was a question of whether or not the sprayed
messages were a defacement of property.

When Kinberg showed the police sergeant how the bicycle used a
non-permanent spray chalk, the sergeant seemed to agree that it wasn't
defacement, at which point Kinberg asked, "am I free to go?" After
conferring about it, officers decided to call superiors, then came back
moments later to place Kinberg under arrest and confiscate the bicycle.

Kinberg cooperated fully with the officers as he was being handcuffed,
only asking, "can I ask what I'm being arrested for?" to which no one
provided an answer. As of 11:00 PM Saturday evening, he was still in
custody without being charged with anything.

Video of the incident is available as a torrent at DV Guide.

I liked this poem so much that I had to reply with my Revolutionary's Prayer
One man, one son, one prophet
but, Mumia is locked up tight despite the evidence
John Afrika dead a marytr, the movement's in motion with massive militant
poetry it goes
& some say, What do you mean John 3:16?

...
mother earth
cry 1 thousand times in me
Revolution Revolution Revolution
make me fear in your destruction and pray in its deliverance

make me humble

father sky
speak your name 1 Thousand times
of how you always speak in love

peace peace peace He said
to trouble our minds when in doubt
His name is like a cry & His prayer
I feel as if to speak His name
Is a blasphemy, when not done in the right way
And I would never pray on Sunday
Without my heart
Calm my tears
Speak Peace in me
& if I might have too, fight for it
Let me only witness manifestations of peace
That I might see friendship, love, and brotherhood
& sisterhood
of that to which we all pray
Peace Peace Peace
Let me feel how you give
Love love love
Quiet is the night
So let us talk love during the day
In our lives in our happiness
Not our pain
Let my words be love
As if I was talking to the wall
With my back turned to you
Listen but do not believe
Let belief be in the audience or not
But I pray they listen to my heart
& That you are happy Jesus Christ with my offering
Give me peace for saying it, as if I had never picked up a gun in my life
As if I will never need to pick up a gun in my life
Amen.

Meritage Press is thrilled to release the e-chapbook, The Oracular Sonnets,=20
an e-collaborative venture between New Zealand-born, Australian-based poet M=

Young and Finnish poet Jukka-Pekka Kervinen.  Their collaboration may be=20

An interesting component of the e-chap are the "Afterwords" which replicates=

the underlying correspondence which show the birth of The Oracular Sonnets.=20=
 A=20
brief summary is provided below on Kervinen's and Young's approach which=20
relied on "templates" for poems generated by two computer programs.  The poe=

aesthetic concerns, Meritage's interests necessarily encompass a variety of=20
disciplines -- politics, culture, identity, science, humor, religion, histor=
y,=20
technology, philosophy and wine."(1)

Last but not least, and speaking to Poetry's power that it even addresses th=

ever-timely concern for world peace, The Oracular Sonnets became the project=
=20
that launched the Finnish & Australasian Co-Prosperity Sphere. =20

Bionotes
New Zealand-born, Australian-based Mark Young began publishing poetry=20
forty-five years ago, but went through a long period of silence from 1975 un=
til the=20
last few years. His recent work has appeared in a wide range of print and=20
electronic journals, from Alba to zNine. He has published two previous books=
 of=20
poetry and a book on New Zealand painting. An e-book, calligraphies, is due=20=
out=20
later this year. He maintains a primary weblog, pelican dreaming (2), but al=

has his much-praised Series Magritte (3) which is an on-going collection of=20
poems inspired by the great Belgian painter Ren=E9 Magritte. His author's pa=

A composer as well as a poet, Jukka-Pekka Kervinen lives and writes in Espoo=

A true history of The Oracular Sonnets
By Mark Young (7/9/04) =20

Saturday, April 10, 2004. I posted a piece to my pelican dreaming blog, A=20
poem beginning with a line from Jukka-Pekka Kervinen. Not a great poem, but=20=
I=20
found humour in doing it, the title a pastiche of Robert Duncan's A poem=20
beginning with a line from Pindar plus Jukka's description of his work as no=
nlinear=20
poetry. I'd been getting bombarded through my hotmail account with spam that=
 was=20
comprised of random words, generated by a program I thought probably similar=
=20
to one of Jukka's, had used their subject lines to make a nonlinear poem of=20=
my=20
own, so Jukka was occupying my thoughts at the time.

We knew each other in the way that bloggers do. My first publication (apart=20
from a curated invitation) after I came back to writing was in a journal tha=
t=20
also had him in it. We shared the same line in the spread-across-the-page in=
dex=20
of authors. His is a name that is easily noticed; Jukka-Pekka like a ragged=20
mountain range, Kervinen like the valleys that slope down from them. Over th=
e=20
next couple of years we appeared together several times. We both became=20
participants in the As/Is group blog, commented on one another's work from t=
ime to=20
time.  He accepted some poems of mine for xStream, then some more. We emaile=
d=20
one another. I sent him a manuscript for his excellent xPress(ed) series. He=
 was=20
one of the first to put up a link when I started pelican dreaming. His=20
nonlinear poetry blog was the first link I put up on mine.

The Friday after the post I got an email from him, acknowledging the poem,=20
giving me a bit of stick for my earlier remark that the content of the spam=20
emails was from his blog. & then, in brackets, almost as if it were an=20
afterthought, he mentioned that he had some 'intentionally unfinished' poems=
, templates, &
 would I be interested in some collaborations. Would I? Sent back an=20
affirmative response, & received the first five the next morning.

Within three hours the template beginning " n l rs  se   be a t  d s a" had=20
become a poem that started "nearly seized & beaten, / but escaped through".=20=
I=20
sent it off to him, to see if he liked it, to see if it was the way he wante=
d=20
us to go. An excited email came back in the evening. Consensus. By that time=
=20
I'd already done more. The next morning I sent an attachment containing eigh=
t=20
poems off to him.

There were poems provoked by the templates, incorporating the templates -=20
crossed out, written through, inverted, truncated -- & some having absolutel=
y=20
nothing to do with them apart from being written within the same frenzied pe=
riod.=20
At this point there was little sense of unity between the poems -- they were=
=20
individual pieces, but amongst them the threads of chance, linkage & states=20=
of=20
being.

That evening -- it's a time zone thing, this morning/evening=20
Finland/Australia correspondence -- five more templates arrived. The first b=
egan " r   d  s   =20
            se    s a / o  al" & from that came "roads seesaw towards the /=20
the oracle" fourteen lines in all, the first Oracular Sonnet. Now there was=20=
an=20
overall framework, a direction. The creative frenzy continued. Chance=20
reinforced throughout. As example: I wanted to chop an existing sonnet in tw=
o=20
vertically. Picked an anthology from the bookcase & the first sonnet I found=
 was=20
Yeats' Leda & The Swan, about beating wings. & one of the poems I had writte=
n=20
stimulated by the first group of templates had the lines "of the / beating w=
ings /=20
of words". It was one of those times when everything just fell into place.

At 4.11 p.m. on the Monday evening, two & a half days after the first=20
templates arrived, the eighteen poem sequence of The Oracular Sonnets of Mar=
k Young &=20
Jukka-Pekka Kervinen was on its way from Rockhampton to Espoo. Accompanied b=
y=20
a tumultuous roll of drums, FAACOPS, the Finnish & Australasian Co-Prosperit=
y=20
Sphere, had been launched.

37 years to the day Woody Guthrie died, Ravenhymn Productions presents the
official CD release party for:

RADICAL FOLK OF THE GREAT NORTH
JOEY ONLY AND THE COMRADES
sunday, october 3, 7:30, 324 cambie
the afro-canadian restaurant


Featuring the anarcho-folk and bluesy grass songs of a now guitarless Joey
Only (guitar stolen!!).  I have just finished putting together a record
with Raven Hymn Productions called RADICAL FOLK OF THE GREAT NORTH.  It is
9 of the most radical folk songs to ever touch on Canadian politics, all
dedicated to the hardworkin radicals fighting to end capitalism.  With
songs such as â€˜No One is Illegalâ€™ â€˜Fire on Anarchist Mountainâ€™ and â€˜Song
for A BC Fightbackâ€™ youâ€™ll laugh, cry and hopefully riot.  At the release
party we will have simplified versions of the CD on sale for $5, all the
sounds of banjo, fiddle, harmonica, gang vocals, hand drums, piano and
mandolin are worth it!

With special guest performers:
-David Roy Parsons, singing real working class folk songs.
-Kamiya, young and talented young politico singer.
-Lukka, veteran songwriter and gifted performer.
-Joanna Chapman-Smith, the most underrated performer in town.

PLUS:
Andy Mason and the Tricksters, a full out rockâ€™n folk show.

(Still waiting for confirmation) The Flying Folk Army, Vancouverâ€™s best
known political folk act.  With a valiant contribution on Radical Folk of
the Great North by Folk Army fiddler Megan Adams.

AND A SPECIAL FEATURE:
the unveilling of Joey Onlyâ€™s new punk rock act:  THE ARRESTED.
Vancouverâ€™s newest most metalish punk rock trio.  Singing anti-cop,
fantastical, Lord of the Rings themed fighting songs at 130mph.  Featuring
songwriter Stiff Josh on guitar (axe) and vx, Sean Brophy on bass
(battleaxe), and Joey Only on the wardrums.  Destined to be a legend.


A SHOW UNLIKE ANY OTHER!!
Sunday October 3rd, 324 Cambie Street, the Afro-Canadian Restaurant
basement doors open at 7:30PM, $5 suggested fee, no one turned away.

I liked your post, Ray, despite its extreme male-centricism.  For my
money, some of the most radical poets in the 20th century were female.
I guess we all live in our own Poetry Magazine of the soul.

Here in Chicago on WGN Radio there is a great nighttime show called
Extension 720 with Professor Milt Rosenberg of the University of
Chicago.
This show has art and book reviews and some of the most intelligent talk
on
commercial radio. Last Thursday he did his twice yearly Poetry program.

One of his guests was Christian Wiman of "Poetry" Magazine and some
other
poet who lives here in Chicago whose work is so banal that I almost fell
asleep driving home.  It was two hours of the most banal, boring poetry
it
was like eating wonder bread drenched in velveeta. It was like a
Saturday
Night Live skit that wanted to make poetry so boring and so irrelevant
as to
be funny abd yet they were serious.

They spent 25 minutes on Gerard Manley Hopkins (Whom I do Like),20
minutes
on Phillip Larkin,it seemed like hours on Auden, a whole slew of Rhyming
poets there was no mention of Pound, Williams, Olson, Ginsberg, Black
Mountain, San Francisco Rennaissance, Spicer, Bernstein,
Howe,Duncan,Ashbury
Creeley. You would think in a city like Chicago with the number of
experimental poets we have they could have got someone descent. There
was
not a mention of Slam either and Chicago is the birthplace of that form
even
if you dont like it it is a force here. The whole show could have been
recorded in 1950 not 2004.

Wiman even said that the great loss of late was the death of Donald
Justice
and that he is so influential, have I missed something, I had Justice at
Iowa he is a nice man but influential? Anyway I thought it was
interesting
and it showed the state of Poetry Magazine (The Republican Party
Rhyming).

Why didn't Ruth Lilly submit to LANGUAGE and get rejected and then gave
millions to Charles Bernstein and Bruce Andrews?!!!!!!!!!!

Fascists Get Out (for a Broadway play)


Republicans are here trying to take over the city.
I want to see them dead. I can't help it.
Every time I here a pro-Bush statement I have a visceral reaction.
These bland faces violate women, gays, countries, blacks, everyone.
Such happy God faces I want to see dead.
I hate myself for hatred. I can't help it.
All Republicans should get the welcome they deserve.
They are walking our streets stinking up our polluted air.
The thermal inversion layer is within eight feet of the ground.
They will lower the thermal inversion layer to six feet.
If I jump high enough I can breathe. Then I can spit at Republicans.

I am a coward wishing for violence.

Republicans understand violence. They are good at it.
Beheaded Republicans for Iraqi beheadings.
Exploded Republicans for Iraqi explosions.
Hidden Republican deaths for media Iraqi sanitation squads.
Destroyed Reagan and Nixon libraries for Iraqi library lootings.
Wounded Republican children for wounded Iraqi boys and girls.
(Now you don't like this poem.)

Harsh light of media critique on every Republican pore.
Every wounded animal and plant in polluted waters and clearcut forests.
Bush bodies exploded with burning oil gushers out of every hole.

I am a coward filled with hatred.

I understand violence and run away and dream of it.
Republicans are our conquerors and colonizers.
Their Christ carries lies and missiles and their God invented anthrax.
They will go to Heavens filled with done-up Republicans.

Listen Republicans, New York curses your days and nights.
Republicans, you have taken your ears off, now take off.
(Go home, the poem is over.)

Personally- My favorite poet is Muriel Rukeyser & I would have to ask, what
would constitute "experimental"? For example, I would consider the strength
& ability to create a visual motion (not stagnation) in her work & then to
live her life almost as the same kind of expression (of independance?) as
extremely experimental. I read have read so much of her collected works that
they are starting to be burned into my memory, but I don't think she ever
stopped to say that she was using this or that technique (even if she
was)... for all intensive purposes she just called it writing. Are we
talking about utilizing techniques to say "experimental" & thus discounting
experience itself or are we simply illustrating the poor quality of poets
who say direct experience is everything? I can almost taste the cheesiness
of that Chicago poetry. Peace,
Ian VanHeusen

You are totally right Mairead, and I kicked myself after I posted it on the
List-

I love your work, Lisa Jarnot, Sina Queyras, Liz Willis, Jen Hofer,
Catherine Daly, Stacy Szymazcek and many others and I apologize for my
sexism.

I think that allot of "experimental" male poets worship at the altar of
"our" experimental poets and forget others I admit I did this and I am
embarrassed at myself.

I do believe in growth and redemptions however so hopefully I can be saved?

concerning the articles (see below). Lakeview prostitution sting yields
19 arrests
By Imran Vittachi

&
20 nabbed in prostitution sting -- 15 men dressed as women
BY CHERYL V. JACKSON Staff Reporter


these news "articles" ARE an egresses act of violence.

NOT only are trans folkz and unprotect GROUP OF PEOPLE who lack
adequate heath care and social services; MANY are unable to get
employment during transition and ARE reduced to prostitution; leading
to arrests, humiliation and shame or worse. BUT, these reporters found
it necessary to DOUBLE-signify these individuals as men in dresses...
then go on to describe them as transgenders in transition.. this is
overt hate language if I have ever seen it...

when will this gendercentric hetronormative social oppression stop . .
. and when will there be adequate employment and social support for all
people..?

when will capitalism's evol stop enforcing "the other" (female) woman
into prostitution, AND when will it stop arresting those who are trying
to survive...?

when will reporters stop leading readers into  voyeuristic  aspect of
the other reduced by feminization... when will feminist see that this
is an act of violence on woman as well, and demand an end to it...?

Nineteen suspected prostitutes, four of them women, were nabbed in the
sting.
The rest were men in drag and others who were undergoing sex changes,
Waldera said. Of the 19 arrested, 18 were charged with prostitution, a
misdemeanor, and one was charged with being caught for prostitution
more than once, a felony, said Chicago police spokeswoman JoAnn Taylor.

My Own Hunger Strike

By Ramzy Baroud - August 29, 2004

Today I will fast in solidarity with 2,800 Palestinian political
prisoners currently carrying out a hunger strike in 10 Israeli jails.

Those prisoners are not 'murderers' as Israeli officials are describing
them, but courageous individuals who have endured for the sake of
freedom and liberty, principles that most of us only understand as
clichés and mindless slogans.

It is disheartening that those striking men and women, whose only fault
was resisting the degraded policies of the Israeli state and its
perpetual occupation of Palestinian land, have been forgotten for this
long.

It's equally painful to see how the prisoners have downscaled their
demands. In past hunger strikes, they called for freedom, or at least
for their plight to be recognized by Israeli and Palestinian officials.
Today they are merely demanding an end to the humiliating strip searches
by their Israeli prison guards, longer visiting hours with their
families and improved sanitation.

Such simple demands should not require the invoking of the Fourth Geneva
Convention or the United Nations Charter on Human Rights. But for
Israel, even such requests are outlandish. The Israeli government has in
fact declared its hospitals off-limits to ailing strikers.

"I am not prepared for there to be a situation where the lives of
patients and medical teams are endangered in our hospitals as a result
of having to admit these murderers," Health Minister Danny Naveh told
the Israeli Army Radio on August 24.

A few days earlier, another cabinet member and a member of Ariel
Sharon's right wing Likud Party, Public Security Minister Tzahi Hanegbi
responded to the strikers and their supposed 'excessive' demands by
declaring that he didn't care if the prisoners starved to death.

But since these captive men and women (including many children) have no
other choice but to keep their demands to a minimum, I don't see why I
should. I am not in Israeli custody; nor do I live at the mercy of Naveh
and Hanegbi who would let me starve to death before they fix the sewer
in my solitary confinement.

Because I am not under the thumb of the Likud party and its repressive
regime, I decided to go to the extreme with my hunger strike demands list.

I demand the immediate release of every Palestinian political prisoner,
woman, man and child. Until such demands are secured, Israel should
completely cease every act of torture committed against my brothers and
sisters in torture chambers across Israel and the West Bank. I demand
that their dignity be respected and honor preserved, if not for the sake
of simple humanity, then because of the Geneva Convention's provisions
regarding prisoners of war.

I demand that the international community, lead by the United Nations
and the Red Cross exhaust every avenue necessary to ensure that the
Israeli government stops using prisoners as a bargaining chip in its
political coercion campaign against the Palestinian Authority, to ensure
the implementation of international treaties on the question of
prisoners' rights, and to enforce equally compelling sanctions on Israel
if it fails to live up to such responsibilities, as recognized by
international law.

I demand international human rights groups to continue monitoring the
Israeli infringement on prisoners' rights and to make those findings
widely available to educate people and influence international policies,
and so that people around the world might press their governments to see
that Israel puts an end to its unlawful practices.

I demand that the United States government stop using my tax money to
arm the Israeli occupation forces with bullets, tear gas, riot-gear and
other deadly means to subdue Palestinian prisoners during freedom riots.
(Side note: I also demand the US government stop using Israeli
interrogators to pass on their treacherous torture techniques so that
they might be used on Iraqis and other political prisoners around the
world.)

I demand Arab and Muslim governments to stop paying lip service to the
Palestinian cause and to quit holding fancy dinner banquets in the honor
of deprived orphans and suffering widows. Instead, I urge them to
achieve a collective, perpetual and meaningful campaign, supporting the
Palestinian struggle in alliance with all forces of peace around the
world. (Side note: I also demand that they release their own political
prisoners, especially the last cohort of political prisoners detained by
Mauritanian police for protesting in support of Palestinian prisoners on
this most recent hunger strike.)

I demand that the PA and it's ruling Fatah party quit their inner
fighting and meaningless power struggle, especially since they have
acquired neither political nor territorial sovereignty to begin with. I
demand that they remain focused on the collective self-determination of
their people and that they side with the freedom deprived prisoners.
(Side note: By siding with the freedom-deprived prisoners, I am not
suggesting that empty and superficial speeches be read on the news day
and night, but a unified national agenda coupled with a realistic vision
to bring an end to the suffering of captive Palestinians.)

I petition myself to remember that at any given moment, there is a
Palestinian man or woman, stripped and humiliated, beaten while hanging
from a rusty and damp ceiling, somewhere in Israel, handcuffed, shackled
and blindfolded, yet refusing to be subdued, all because he or she
attempted to protect a village, a people, a past, an idea, a fleeting
dream.

I demand that I imprint on my own heart, the pain endured in those
lonely cells and the pain of thousands confined by the greater prison
wall that is sucking the life out of the West Bank and Gaza. Lest I
forget, I declare my own hunger strike.

Last week I found two of my poems translated on a Dutch poetry site.  And now, Tony Tost, another resident of little Carrboro, North Carolina, is the current poet featured on the 'Poeziepamflet' website.
http://www.poeziepamflet.nl/index.html

How 'bout that?

Oddly enough, three of the five poets at the top of the front page of Poeziepamflet are current or former residents of North Carolina who recently read at the Carrboro Poetry Festival.  You can find audio here:

A while back Joe Donahue was half-joking about the sudden appearance of poetic activity in Carrboro and called it the "Carrboro Renaissance."  Joe, I still think it's hilarious.

I've noticed that among almost all of the participants in our online
discussions, "experimentalism" is usually upheld as a virtue in and of
itself. But in just about any other field--science, say--experimentation is
a means to an end, and can only be judged once the experiment is considered
as a failure or a success.

I also have a preference for the edgy, but I'm also hesitant to put
experimentation for its own sake on a pedestal. Experimentation has led to
some of the greatest writing ever, but it's also led to some of the worst (I
can't read Gertrude Stein, or E. E. Cummings, or a lot of what LANGUAGE has
produced; I'm sure others could come up with their own examples of
experimentalists they hate, and maybe even traditionalists--if that's an
appropriate binary--they like).

But while I'd want someone from a magazine like Poetry (if not Poetry
itself) to address Olson, Spicer, Duncan, Creeley, Rukeyser, Levertov, and,
why not, Hejinian, in addition to Hopkins, Larkin, Auden, and rhyming poets,
as well as Slam, I wouldn't want a magazine like Poetry to discuss the
avant-garde instead of the old guard.

Poetry Magazine uses a line in some of its advertisements that reads
something like, "the history of poetry in America and Poetry in America are
virtually indistinguishable". From a technical viewpoint, this can't ever
really be true. But if you keep in mind the sense that "history is written
by the victors", then of course it's true. And that means that Poetry
Magazine locks the canon in place. And as far as I'm concerned, I'd rather
have the "experimentalist", the "avant-garde", the edgy, not have to be
beholden to being in the canon. And for what it's worth, I'm afraid that
LANGUAGE poetry, as a specifically determinative avant-garde style, is
running really close to that borderline already. How would they write if
they had a hundred million dollars from a pharmaceuticals heiress?

The summer after I graduated from high school in Chicago I interned at
Poetry Magazine for three months. I didn't know much about Poetry, really,
except that it had published the great Modernists once upon a time. It isn't
the magazine that it once was, and its position in the world of literary
journals has changed dramatically, but that doesn't mean it doesn't still
hold a valuable position. If nothing else, the mainstay mainstream canon
exists to keep the rest of us something to focus on and write against.

Wait a minute!

What?

Are you saying anyone you hate is writing the worst writing ever?

Or that anyone hates?

Criterion? If we're talking experimental science then we need criteria for
judgements and conclusions

Hate whom you wish; but that proves nothing

For instance, I don't much like EEC either, but he's far from the worst; and
much of Stein is wonderful & I'm not sure she was experimenting. She was
just writing; and I am glad she was

It's not clear to me what you are saying

Do you really think I'm saying that anyone I hate is "the worst ever"?

As much as I'd love to have my opinion be objective stone-carved fact, I am
suggesting only that all of us can surely agree that a lot of experimental
writing is bad writing. That doesn't mean we agree on who those writers are,
or what experimental writing is, or what bad writing is. But it does mean
that experimentalism shouldn't be a goal in itself. If it's a means to a
goal, then great. But writing for the sake of experimentalism gives us
writing no better or worse than writing for the sake of rhyme, or tradition,
or laundry detergent.

Two points, simply stated:

In the broad sense, any writing is experimental, and any writing is
judged--and valued--by the success of that experiment, not on its existsnce.

And if avant-garde writing were somehow to take over as the mainstream, it
would create the same kinds of schisms and disappointments amongst the few
of us who care about literature anyway as the current Official Verse Culture
does.

I was specifically trying not to come off as dogmatic in mentioning 'bad
writing' next to 'my tastes'. And yet I still manage to be read that way.

Hi Lucas

Very glad to hear. I didn't really think that's what you meant to say, but
it could have been taken that way; so I thought I'd chip in.

I agree with you totally about the acceptance of _experimental work_ - I see
schisms etc developing in areas that were previous outlaw and communal as
some experiments are being accepted into the mainstream - point scoring,
competitive edge trickery.... it's sad

DROWNED OUT

Directed by Franny Armstrong (2002, 75 min., UK) Armstrong's documentary

in central India: move to the slums in the city, accept a place at a
resettlement site or stay at home and drown. They must make a decision fast.
In the next few weeks, their village will disappear underwater as the giant
Narmada Dam fills. Bestselling author Arundhati Roy joins the fight against
the dam and asks the difficult questions: Will the water go to poor farmers
or to rich industrialists? What happened to the 16 million people displaced
by fifty years of dam building? Why should I care?

A Video+Text Installation from India's Raqs Media Collective

A/S/L (Age/Sex/Location) is a video+text installation on the lives of women
workers in the online data outsourcing industry in India. The installation

everyday journeys into cyberspace that hundreds of thousands of labouring
women make across the world. It is a document and a dramatization of the
questions that surround these daily migrations between online and off-line
worlds. It addresses the viewer with video, text and sound within the
framework of an on site installation.

FALL EVENT SPOTLIGHT:

Writer's Group Reading Series, Hosted By Karen Lewis
Featuring the DCW's
Friday, October 29, 8 p.m.

The roots of the DCW writing group dig deep into the spring of 1991. Karen
Lewis attended a beginning writer's workshop led by Susan Anner under the
auspices of Just Buffalo Literary Center at the Calumet. At the conclusion
of the workshop the group moved the meeting location to the Arts Council.
Subsequently a small group of writers, including Maureen O'Connor, decided
to get together independently-paying Susan to moderate group meetings. Susan
's heavy teaching schedule eventually brought about her departure and the
collective decided to gather their words at Maureen's house and share the
responsibilities of leadership. Since that time they have met once a month
to discuss/critique previously submitted material. Their group process is
grounded in a supportive, encouraging, fun loving atmosphere. They value
craft, both traditional and experimental, and work to improve their skills
as writers. Most importantly they give and receive honest feedback through
passionate discourse that is rooted in friendship. They don't publicly
divulge the meaning behind the mysterious acronym DCW. Although they do
enjoy being alternately referred to as a feminist cabal, a sorority, the
PBSDPWKRP group, and even a coven, they really enjoy the prose poem bios
that Livio Farallo creates for them best.

The DCW's are:

Karen Lewis is a contributing editor of Traffic East Magazine and a teaching
artist for Just Buffalo Literary Center. She hosts the Writing Group reading
series. Karen's poetry, photography, short fiction and book reviews have
been published throughout the US and Canada, most recently in Stirring,
Moondance, Gypsy Magazine, and The Niagara Current. Maureen O'Connor is a
member of the International Women's Writing Guild. She has been published in
anthologies, including The Shadow's Imprint; forthcoming work will appear in
The Niagara Current.  Jennifer Tappenden is a health care professional whose
avocation is poetry. Originally from Rochester, she earned her BA in English
from the University at Buffalo. Jennifer is a contributing editor for
Traffic East Magazine and a co-host for the local public access television
show Truckstop Intellectuals. Ironically, she refuses to own a television.
Mary O'Herron is an art therapist, addictions counselor and builder of
labyrinths. Her poetry has appeared in The Buffalo News. She's been a member
of the DCW's for 6 years. Amy Christman is a librarian and a poet and is
nearing completion of her training as a Certified Poetry Therapist. She has
facilitated book discussion groups and journal writing workshops for teens
and adults. A collection of her poetry appears in Scribing the Soul: Essays
in Journal Therapy by Kathleen Adams. Claudia Torres hates biographies. She
is the newest member of the group. She loves the DCW's because "they don't
taunt you and insult you to your face and they don't change the nature of
your stuff. The group mentality forces you to work to whip something into
submission. And we eat delicious pastries and fruit." Claudia hosts
"Truckstop Intellectuals" for HOTF-TV.

can be yours, but first you must write the story. For both veterans and

character, generating scenes and, finally, how to make it all make sense.

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and
taverns!),mutilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented
forms. We will explore the structural possibilities of language to
ultimately answer the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning
and practiced poets will generate lots of original writing from this full
day of language play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye
with which to revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson Literary
Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the Arts, Mad
Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled notspeak.

Call for Papers
http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/affinities/

International Association of Word and Image Studies: Elective Affinities
Philadelphia, 23-27 September, 2005

The title of the conference has been borrowed from Goethe=92s 1809 novel=20
Elective Affinities.  There, the term =93elective affinities=94 is the=
 subject=20
of an
energetic debate.  A chemical term that was in currency from the late
eighteenth century, in the novel it extends to human relationships, both
intimate and political.  Since this is a novel that foregrounds =93mixed=
 media=94
such as tableaux vivants (i.e. dramatic performances of artworks) and the
picturesque garden, the concept of =93elective affinities=94 also has=
 profound
implications for the relationship between words and images.  Like the=
 alkalis
and acids of which Goethe=92s characters speak, words and images, though
apparently opposed, may have a remarkable affinity for one another.  At the
same time, as one of the protagonists objects, such affinities are=20
problematic,
and =93are only really interesting when they bring about separations.=94 =
 The
conference seeks =AD in the spirit of Goethe=92s allusive discussion =AD to=
 explore
word/image interactions in literature and visual arts from a broad=
 historical
perspective, and also as they extend to fields as diverse as Political=20
Science,
Religious Studies, and History of Science.

IAWIS invites submission of proposals for papers (250-300 words) to
affinities@ccat.sas.upenn.edu. See website for listing of specific panels=20
and address proposals accordingly.

The deadline for submissions is October 1, 2004.

Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

The NYC demonstrations were a delight to see on C-Span - the absence of any
narrative intervention on the part of the Network let the evidence (the
sheer mass and particularity of signs, faces, clothes, drumming, body
movements, dancing , water bottles, etc) and the event speak for itself. It
was also a delight to see that one's apprehension of provocation's for a
full scale police/demo riot did not take place. I can only suspect that the
Fox people were disappointed not to be able to manipulate the visual
possibilities of such a riot into a pro-Bush screed.
There are several days to go. My hope is that the demonstration will
continue in all forms and work to keep outflanking the right wing dictates
of a dull and predictable Convention.
And, of course that no wacko group unleashes some major terrorist act.  In
Najef, the after-attack images in yesterday's New York Times, struck me as
an all-out terrorist attack on the neighborhoods and the cemetery
surrounding the Shrine. Jesus, what our tax dollars can buy and perform!
What's going to spare this country reciprocal acts I don't even want to
contemplate. It becomes more and more obvious that Bush & Co. has dug us all
a very large hole into which to continue to fall.
More than ever, (this, too, I feel in my bones) it's absolutely essential  -
individually, publicly and collectively - to work for the revival of life
impulses (over paranoid self-destruction) to reclaim the domestic and
international body politic! I wish I could be in New York - they're doing it
big time.

The Portable Reading Series in Baltimore is an enormous success. Deborah Poe, Amy King and Edmund Berrigan read and sang the praises of poetry before 40 people in a warm, crowded room yesterday evening in Minas Gallery. Readings in Baltimore don't usually amass such a crowd; the bigger anomoly is that we've done it twice! (the first was with the launch party for Ambit #1, which drew about 35 people last May) But many strangers showed up for the event and many continued the night by joining us down the street at a local bar, where many friendly new faces opened up what is going to be a beautiful dialogue between the presses and the people.

We also launched Ed Berrigan's new chap from Furniture Press, "Your Cheatin' Heart" of which sold out quickly. I have more, I only brought 20...

So, after the weekend of the New York invasion, I'm sad everyone is gone but glad it's all over, I mean that it went well, absolutely nothing went wrong. We have it on audio and video so we've begun archiving.

That's it. Everyone was phenomenal, even though we were all damn nervous.

Check out the announcement for ed's book, to come...

coward's end


republicans reduce me to the poem

coward's end
strategies for living
the exhilaration of disgrace
preternatural fear of arrest
hope the delegates die is that too much to ask
dear god strike them down where they sit

now if they're struck down i'll feel guilty
i won't believe any more than i do now
a friend is coming over for dinner

so 94 % believe iraq was justified
94 % deserve to lose 94 % of their lives
that's ...

delegates worse than the average
mini-fascists shutting their mouths
the 'moderates' have the floor today
mini-fascists wait in the foreground to take over

we are now and forever a religious state
i am a jew i killed christ
don't blame the resurrection on me
i had nothing to do with it

The revolving DOOR !
by not saying! .
<http://victoria.indymedia.org/news/?author=not+saying%21&comments=yes>
Monday August 30, 2004 at 06:13 PM

    Disability perons are being treated unfair!

Does everybody in Victoria see the homeless, the broken down, the
disabled mentally or physically?

Why is Street Link an a emergency shelter having more mentally and
physically disabled coming through the door? Government cuts to mental
hospitals.

Week after week week, month after month, mostly the same faces visiting
the same places. This does not make sense! They are allot a small amount
of money to help them out enough for bewteen $350-450 in rent money. Why
are they having to stay at street link is this a mental hospitial!Or is
it a emergency shelter.

Why are homeless or under the employed being funneled into street link?
Where they are allot 7 days costing the Provincial around $50 a night
for food and accomaditions. So lets do some math 7 x 50 = $350 dollars
ok thats excatly the amount social services or EI or what ever they have
changed there name to this month, gives for rent. Now you can stay exta
days with the EI workers approval or by waiting till 10 oclock for a
chance to get a bed, and costing even more money. Or you could stay at
the Salvation Army (halfway house) where the feed and shelter you for
about the same amount $50 dollars a night for 7 nights = again $350.
Thats two weeks one at each place, a guy can stay costing the provincial
government $700 dollars for two weeks every month. Iteresting in the
fact that EI only allots a maximum of $525 for under for employed males.
They are going backwards $175 every month for some these people by being
stuck in the revolving door and the cycle of abuse! Not to mention the
emotional and physical damaged that comes from the negativity from the
down trodden.

Then you have drug addicts who use these places because they can't keep
a residence of there own. Because they have abuse issues both mentally
and physically. So now you have mentally and physically disabelled
people conversing with drug dealers, offering drugs to disabled people.


Nice, really nice to know you can have, lets say ahh a mental disorder
of anykind who is very emotionanlly troubled being introduced to speed
or crystal meth or of the many drugs commonly found in the street(link).

So now you could have have menatlly or physically challenged people
hooked on hard drugs! Right On! Good job Gordon!
So now you have a shelter which creates more problems then it solves and
cost more tax dollars. And the staff aren't trained enough to handle all
these issues.

Gordon Campbell give your head a shake at least do the math you money
hungry bonehead. If you can't consider their problems and the issues how
are you going to help the mentally and physically disabled people.
Perhaps if you could pull yourself away from your business lunchins
talking about the business deals going down for the Olympics long enough
to have these issues sorted out. You are mismanaging dollars and holding
the under employed in shelters!

And what about the Landlords in this town(Victoria) some these people
buy property just to have the provincial government pay their mortages
by housing EI clients in some cases in really shabby accomadations for
($350).Seems their is a cycle of abuse happening here and the rich and
government and these big topics seem connected.

Funny what happens when you start connecting the dots!

Not to mention look at the Olympics going on right now how many medals
do we have? Maybe you (Gordon) should and Canada as (w)hole should
consider a little money for training programs and funding more athletes.

Just a morsal to think about, where are the morals of some of the rich
and these government types! And I am sure its not the majority but you
know who you are!

Perhaps lying denying and avoiding takes up your whole day?

Never did never will
just take the pill you're given
& like Muslims standing on the block rocking the goofeys
We let loose & like cartoons start harm
To disarm with liquid swords
The hordes don't need the meditation
Don't even need the sedation
Complacent, Alan... you're the only one I have heard of
Holed up at home for no good reason
Its the season to get your ass in the streets
You walk through every single day
If you need to say hello to cop for me
When we storming like armies with weapons
If they keep their's in hand that's when the war began.
Peace

in room 203 of the Jack Purcell Community Centre (on Elgin, at 320 Jack
Purcell Lane). contact rob at rob@track0.com to sign up for a table, etc.

General info: the ottawa small press book fair noon to 5pm (opens at 11am

admission free to the public. tables are $15 for exhibitors (payable to
rob mclennan, c/o 858 Somerset St W, main floor, Ottawa Ontario K1R 6R7).
full tables only. for catalog, exhibitors should send (on paper, not email)
name of press, address, email, web address, contact person, type of
publications, list of publications (with price), if submissions are being
looked at, & any other pertinent info, including upcoming ottawa-area
events (if any).

due to the increased demand for table space, exhibitors are asked to
confirm far earlier than usual. i.e. -- before, say, the day of the fair.

the fair usually contains exhibitors with poetry books, novels, cookbooks,
posters, t-shirts, graphic novels, comic books, magazines, scraps of
paper, gum-ball machines with poems, 2x4s with text, etc. happens twice a
year, started in 1994 by rob mclennan & James Spyker. now run by rob
mclennan thru span-o.

questions, rob@track0.com or 613 239 0337 more info on span-o at the
span-o link of www.track0.com/rob_mclennan span-o: c/o 858 somerset street
west, main floor, ottawa ontario canada k1r 6r7

free things can be mailed for fair distribution to the same address. we
will not be selling things for folk who cant make it, sorry.

also, always looking for volunteers to poster, move tables, that sort of
thing. let me know if anyone able to do anything. thanks.

& dont forget the toronto small press book fair, happening this fall on
november 6th. www.torontosmallpressbookfair.org
