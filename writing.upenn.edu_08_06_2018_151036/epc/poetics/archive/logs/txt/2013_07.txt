Begging your indulgence from the busy schedule I know you all have, with
the summer beginning I've decided to re-announce  "Beginner's Mind,"
which, unlike its first announcement, now has an introduction.
Also, the first two months (May and June) have been revised. As the
entanglements of texts and images clarify at their own pace, the fantasy
of progress requires working in all directions.

Here's where Beginner's Mind begins:

Thank you, as always.

Greetings all,

Happy to announce the very first issue of N/A, an online journal that will
be publishing things that don't quite fit nicely. There are some amazing
folks in this first issue, including Jerome Rothenberg, Kate Colby, G.C.
Waldrep, Jessica Smith and more!

http://www.nalitjournal.com

Submissions for Issue Two are now open and will be closing in early
September. The hope is to make N/A a quarterly publication.

Thank you all for your time and, again, apologies for the mass email!

Yours,
Amish Trivedi

**Welcome to Boog City 7 Bios and Websites**

Classic Albums Live presents,
for its 15th Anniversary,
Major Matt Mason USA=E2=80=99s Me Me Me

**Jonathan Berger
http://jonberger.com
http://olivejuicemusic.com/artists/jonathan-berger
Jonathan Berger first heard Major Matt Mason USA perform in 1994. He =20
drove MMM to an Albany Borders Books in 1996. He took Nan Turner to =20
her first MMM show in 1999 and published his column in AntiMatters =20
around the same time. Jonathan Berger was at the first Schwervon! =20
show, the first Kansas State Flower show, and the first show where =20
Major Matt Mason stood up to perform. Jonathan Berger has recorded for =20=

Olive Juice Music and cat-sat for Gummo. Occasionally, he writes =20
(Berger, that is).

**Dan and Rachel
http://danandrachel.com/
http://kalerecords.com/
Twisted love-rock duo Dan and Rachel has a wild song collection that =20
ranges from loud dance beats to soft folk tunes, from hilarious =20
commentaries to old-school love songs. Their live performances run the =20=

gamut of human emotion, with songs about bananas, love, social ills, =20
and zombies. Audiences are quick to join in the chorus of =E2=80=9Ctheir =
=20
classic rapid-fire history of the banana.=E2=80=9D (American Songwriter)

Since 2009 they have toured over a dozen countries, playing =20
internationally acclaimed venues including Webster Hall (NYC), El =20
Lokal (Z=C3=BCrich), and the Reeperbahn Festival (Hamburg). They made =
their =20
first album, Damn Monsters!, in 2011.

Their second album, Plus One, was released in 2012 on Kale Records. =20
Dan and Rachel also write songs for the Bushwick Book Club. They live =20=

and grow food in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.

**Steve Espinola and Preston Spurlock
http://paleophone.net/
Steve Espinola is a mostly-piano-playing singer-songwriter, though he =20=

deviates to other instruments. As of late, he is running a boutique =20
artisanal record cutting service specializing in unique "Mixtape" LPs, =20=

Program, and order one for your beloved hipster. His music has been =20
described as a =E2=80=9CFats-Waller-shares-a-cigarette-with-Brian-Wilson-=20=

while-Marianne-Moore-buys-insurance-from-Wallace-Stevens-and-Isabella-=20=

Rossellini-eyes-Stanley-Tucci-in-Big-Night sort of hybrid.=E2=80=9D

http://www.Facebook.com/GoldenRuleStudio
Casey Holford is a Massachusetts-born, Ditmas Park, Brooklyn resident =20=

who has spent the last 12 years playing and recording and listening to =20=

as much music as possible. He's been in a number of bands with funny =20
names, like Urban Barnyard and Art Sorority for Girls, and he has =20
recorded several solo albums and EPs. He produces records for =20
songwriters from his attic studio Golden Rule. He is also an ardent =20
amateur photographer, with a small army of weird old film cameras and =20=

a penchant for soaking his negatives in bourbon.

Matt Colbourn make up the band Kung Fu Crimewave. Rocking New York =20

**Major Matt Mason USA
http://www.olivejuicemusic.com/blogs/mmm
Major Matt Mason USA is the name for songwriter/sound producer Matt =20
Roth=E2=80=99s solo music project. Inspired by the homemade tapes of =
Daniel =20
Johnston and the writings of Raymond Carver, MMM=E2=80=99s first =
recordings =20
appeared in self made cassette format around 1994. He as since =20
released 5 full length albums (on CD and CDR) and two 7=E2=80=9D singles =
on =20
Olive Juice Music. 3 of these albums have also been released in the UK =20=

on Teenage Fan Club drummer Francis MacDonald=E2=80=99s, Glasgow based, =
label =20
Shoeshine Records. MMM's music is riddled with influences that range =20
from the paired down songwriting of early Bob Dylan and Neil Young to =20=

the more aggressive elements of The Velvet Underground and Yo La =20
Tengo. Matt is also a member of the bands Schwervon and Kansas State =20
Flower. The DIY spirit is a big part of MMM=E2=80=99s art and lifestyle =
as he =20
continues to carve a niche for himself and others in the ever evolving =20=

stew of contemporary American Folk Music.

**Justin Remer
http://elasticnonoband.bandcamp.com/

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DTPRP5XwzGtI
Todd Carlstrom and the Clamour are an occasional guts-n-glory rock =20
band with a =
http://www.reverbnation.com/toddcarlstromandtheclamourrotating=20
  cast. So rotating, in fact, that Todd will tell you who's playing =20
tonight when we get onstage. The band started when sessions were =20
ending for Todd's Major Matt-produced album, Gold on the Map. What =20
started as a recording experiment (Todd playing all the instruments =20
and writing many of the songs on the spot) had yielded some good loud =20=

results, so he put together a group to play them live. And thus, the =20
Clamour.

-------------------------

OULIPO, noulipo, Conceptual, flarf, post-flarf: the transformation of =
poetry and prose through deploying strategies of method, structure, =
content, intention and chance/change is a given now. In utilizing =
strategy in our own work, don=92t we wonder how great a part control (or =
the absence of it) should play? How far back should writers stand from =
their works, making way for the (perhaps) foreign agent of "strategy"? =
What benefits accrue to the work? What do writers gain =97 or lose? =
We'll look at and discuss St=E9phane Mallarm=E9's Un coup de d=E9s =
jamais n'abolira le hasard (A throw of the dice will never abolish =
chance), selections from the anthologies OULIPO: A Primer of Potential =
Literature, The Consequence of Innovation: 21st Century Poetics, I'll =
Drown My Book: Conceptual Writing by Women, and Postmodern American =
Poetry: A Norton Anthology, and other related documents. Three written =
assignments, to be discussed during class time, will be based on model =
texts from those works.

Ten Canadian Poets

The thirty-first volume of the poetry annual New American Writing is now
available, with a section of Ten Canadian Poets edited by yours truly,
following on the heels of other selections of Canadian poetry I've
attempted to showcase outside our borders, including the Canadian issue of
Swiss online pdf journal dusie, or the three sections I edited for Jacket
magazine (on Douglas Barbour, on George Bowering and on new Canadian
poetries), as well as a thread that exists in the midst of the new Tuesday
poem feature Ive been curating, over at the dusie blog. Ive actually been
wanting to edit an anthology of twenty-four Canadian poets for a
non-Canadian publisher for years, but haven't yet managed to convince a
publisher.

When soliciting for this small section of New Canadian Writing, I
attempted a cross-section of some of the writers Ive been keeping my eye
on, the ones from various corners of the country that excite me. They
range from the well-established to the other end of emerging; they range
from the experimental to the more lyric narrative. The differences between
our two countries are small, stark, obvious, nebulous and often impossible
to articulate. There is no single difference. We look and sound like you,
but after a while, subtle difference come up, that you hadnt quite noticed
before.

There have certainly been improvements over the past decade, but on the
whole, writing doesnt cross the Canadian/American border easily, and most
international publishers that produce poetry works dont often publish the
works of Canadians, leaving us aware of works by American, British and
other international writers, but predominantly as a one-way system. Online
journals such as Jacket magazine, Jacket2 and Lemonhound have certainly
worked to improve the conversations between countries, as well as the
Canadian poets now with author pages on the American Electronic Poetry
Center website, but there is always room for improvement. I hope that this
small engagement might provide some further interest in what some truly
amazing Canadian poets have been up to, lately.

Thanks so much to Paul Hoover and Maxine Chernoff for allowing me this
space in their journal.

seventeen seconds: a journal of poetry and poetics comes out as the
natural extension of the eight issues of Poetics.ca edited by rob mclennan
and Stephen Brockwell. Highlighting the diversity of voice, style,
practice and politic, seventeen seconds continues the resolve to provide a
forum for dialogue on contemporary poetics, with a focus on Canadian
writing. Over the past two decades, the amount of critical writing
published in print literary journals on Canadian poetry, specifically,
seems to have decreased dramatically, but slowly returned through a number
of online journals. seventeen seconds simply wishes to help strengthen the
dialogue and the ongoing conversation about writing through publishing new
writing, and conversation about new writing. How else are we supposed to
learn anything, unless we keep talking?

	same, always different, brackish body, uncertain. The
	unusual I hold at bay by taking pictures. To let it accrue
	to memory without having to experience it? Do we live this
	way, walking, as if we could, on thin air? But the sycamore
	stands in the yard all day and all night. And now, though
	still lifeless in appearance, quickens. Roots gripping
	farther down.

*Textsound issue 17: Fence Books Mix Tape*

Textsound has produced a small number of special issues in the past: We
published an issue focusing on Jon Cotner and Andy
Fitch<http://www.textsound.org/index.php?ISSUE=3D9>=92s
collaborative works, in celebration of their UDP release *Ten Walks/Two
Talks,* and Anna Vitale curated an homage to the poetics in her home state,
*Michyou* <http://www.textsound.org/index.php?ISSUE=3D10>.

Issue 17 kicks off a new series of special issues, this time focusing on
small presses. The issue=92s not meant to be a replication of the publisher=
=92s
bookshelf, but an aural insight into the individual voices that make up the
press=92s collective body. We left the call open-ended; contributors were
asked to send readings from printed texts, critical work, soundscapes,
collaborations, manifestos, or whatever else they could imagine.

The Fence Books Mix Tape <http://www.textsound.org/> kicks off the small
press series with works from Geraldine Kim, Rodrigo Toscano w/ Joshua
Leibowitz, Laura Sims, Anthony McCann, Paul Legault w/ Joseph Kaplan, Sasha
Steensen, Elizabeth Robinson, Nick Demske, Catherine Wagner, Donald Dunbar,
Jena Osman, Douglas Kearney, James Shea, Elizabeth Marie Young, Michael
Earl Craig, Kaisa Ullsvik Miller, Paul Maliszewski, Ben Doller, Josie
Sigler, Harmony Holiday, Brandon Downing, and Prageeta Sharma.



*New Happenings*

Hannah Ensor is joining the editorial board. Hannah writes poetry and makes
noise-pop tentacular deep-ocean sounds with John Melillo as the band Algae
& Tentacles. Her poems are online at Spork Press, Evening Will Come, and
Network Awesome, and in print in CutBank and Bat City Review. She holds an
MFA in creative writing from the University of Arizona and serves on the
board of directors of Casa Libre en la Solana, a literary arts nonprofit in
Tucson, Arizona.

Some of our contributors are collaborating on audio pieces for *The
Conversant* <http://theconversant.org/>. You can check out the first
installment here <http://theconversant.org/?p=3D3169>.

Our next issue will be a spotlight on Bay Area poetics, curated by Adam
Fagin.

d'ailleurs dans le cadre des célébrations du Mardi Gras de 2014 que se
déroulera le lancement du journal à Lafayette, en Louisiane. Les textes
seront présentés en anglais mais également en français louisianais. Les
prochaines publications d'Embrasser auront pour thème le français et les
cultures francophones retrouvés autour du monde.

Pour sa première publication, Embrasser est à la recherche de :

*Textes de fiction *et*de non-fiction créative *allant jusqu’à 4000
mots; *de textes de poésie *allant jusqu’à 100 lignes, *de* *pièces de
théâtre ou des scénarios,* allant jusqu’à 10 pages. Ces textes peuvent
être rédigés par des habitants de la Louisiane ou par quelqu'un qui
écrit au sujet de l’expérience louisianaise. De plus, nous acceptons des
*textes de critique littéraire* au sujet d’une pièce ou d'une oeuvre
littéraire, d’une oeuvre d'art visuel ou une oeuvre audiovisuelle, d'une
performance musicale ou orale publiée, produite, écrite, créée ou
performée en Louisiane, allant jusqu’à 3000 mots. Pour ces textes, nous
recherchons des discussions d'actualité : les oeuvres réalisées avant
l'an 2000 ne seront pas considérées.

*Les soumissions devront être rédigées en anglais ou dans l'une des
variantes du français louisianais.*

Si acceptées, les soumissions en anglais vont être traduites en français
louisianais et celles en français seront traduites en anglais. Les
écrivains bilingues sont encouragés de traduire leurs propres textes et
de les soumettre dans les deux langues.

Embrasser est un journal d'impression traditionnelle. Donc, nous
préférons les textes courts. Chaque auteur peut soumettre jusqu'à trois
textes. Toutefois, nous sommes désolés mais nous n’accepterons pas les
textes qui ont été déjà publiés ou les publications simultanées.

*Les textes devront être soumis pour le 30 Septembre 2013 et envoyés à :
*Embrasser AT CoeurPublishing DOT com
<mailto:embrasser@coeurpublishing.com>.

Embrasser, un journal international de traduction du français et de
l’anglais est édité par Emily Thibodeaux et Rosalyn Spencer sous la
direction de Rikki Ducornet.

The Laurentian Book of Movement
Christine McNair and rob mclennan

	The Laurentian Book of Movement

		The moths die as soon as I learn their names. I hear
		nothing from the bats but what the machine tells me.
		They are sending their best wishes, reminding me to
		breathe.
        		Richard Froude, Fabric

	In 1842, Augustin-Norbert Morin walked into the woods. There were
	only woods.

	The forest houses one kind of logic. There is more than one. You
	called out names under your breath. You stepped out into fleshy rain.

	The constellations were in error. We read the sounds of birds.

	The skyline, black against the night blue. The first few pages
	of the weather wrote a thunderstorm. The eaves were full of
	leaves. Rain water overflowed the porch. We chomped out portions
	of late summer, reckless portions of Aurora Borealis.

	A thread pulls powder across various landmarks. We walk into the
	Metro. This is not a pilgrimage.

	The English language corresponds with optical illusions. One looks
	too close sometimes, and words begin to shimmer, flick. A chance
	occurance, breathes.

	There were only woods, north-rolling mountain range a snake across
	the continent. My mouth full of leaves.

	The bed was rich of metal, sleep. I walked into your shoulder.

Subject:      the ottawa small press fair,
              19th anniversary/autumn 2013 edition: october 12, 2013

span-o (the small press action network - ottawa) presents:

    the ottawa
    small press
    book fair

autumn 2013 edition
will be happening Saturday, October 12
in room 203 of the Jack Purcell Community Centre
(on Elgin, at 320 Jack Purcell Lane).

contact rob at rob_mclennan@hotmail.com to sign up for a table, etc.

"once upon a time, way way back in October 1994, rob mclennan & James
Spyker invented a two-day event called the ottawa small press book fair,
and held the first one at the National Archives of Canada..." Spyker moved
to Toronto soon after our original event, but the fair continues, thanks
in part to the help of generous volunteers, various writers and
publishers, and the public for coming out to participate with alla their
love and their dollars.

General info:
the ottawa small press book fair
noon to 5pm (opens at 11:00 for exhibitors)

admission free to the public.

$20 for exhibitors, full tables
$10 for half-tables
(payable to rob mclennan, c/o 402 McLeod St #3, Ottawa ON K2P 1A6;

send by October 1 if you would like to appear in the exhibitor catalogue.

note: for the sake of increased demand, we are now offering half tables.
for catalog, exhibitors should send name of press, address, email, web
address, contact person, type of publications, list of publications (with
price), if submissions are being considered & any other pertinent info,
including upcoming ottawa-area events (if any).

& don't forget the pre-fair reading usually held the night before, info
tba! also,

BE AWARE: given that the spring 2013 was the first to reach capacity
(forcing me to say no to at least half a dozen exhibitors), the fair can't
(unfortunately) fit everyone who wishes to participate. the fair is
roughly first-come, first-served, but preference will be given to small
publishers over self-published authors (being a "small press fair," after
all).

the fair usually contains exhibitors with poetry books, novels,cookbooks,
posters, t-shirts, graphic novels, comic books, magazines, scraps of
paper, gum-ball machines with poems, 2x4s with text, etc, including (at
previous events) Bywords, Dusty Owl, Chaudiere Books, above/ground press,
Room 302 Books, The Puritan, The Ottawa Arts Review, Buschek Books, The
Grunge Papers, Broken Jaw Press, BookThug, Proper Tales Press, Phafours
Press, and others. happens twice a year, founded in 1994 by rob mclennan &
James Spyker. now run by rob mclennan thru span-o. questions,
rob_mclennan@hotmail.com

free things can be mailed for fair distribution to the same address. we
are unable to sell things for folk who can't make it, sorry. also, always
looking for volunteers to poster, move tables, that sort of thing. let me
know if anyone able to do anything. thanks. for more information, bother
rob mclennan.if you're able/willing to distribute posters/fliers for the
fair, send me an email.

I=92m not out to deny anyone institutional participation or access to
resources; rather, I want to call attention to the claim these groups
purport to block capitalism while intentionally employing capitalist
techniques (i.e. media-style sensationalism to garner notice, sound-bite
saturation, prolific self-referencing, reducing all other modes of
subjective expression to exchangeable equivalences, etc.) to achieve and
secure status within the capitalist structure.

Apostrophe, Odes, Ekphrasis, Oh My!


Dates: August 5-30, 2013

In the course of this workshop, we will look at a the work and lives of a
variety of artists such as Leonor Fini, Frida Kahlo, Dorothea Tanning &
Remedios Varo, as well as numerous poets like Paul Eluard, Allen Ginsberg,
Rachel Eliza Griffiths, Edna St. Vincent Millay & many more, and consider
how ekphrasis can extend beyond mere description of the visual arts but may
also be combined with address (apostrophe) or incorporate the ode as a
means to reflect appreciation of, and concerns from, an artist's work.

Subject:      above/ground press at twenty; the 2013 list (so far,

others (including recent "poem" broadsides by Pearl Pirie, Sarah Mangold

Keep an eye out for the twentieth anniversary reading/launch in later
August, and the reading/launch of the above/ground press "best of the
second decade" anthology through the ottawa international writers festival
in October!

*The Urn and the Urinal (Poetry Where Death Goes) *
*
*
*The poet is the priest of the invisible.
          =96 Wallace Stevens*

Into one, the corpse is poured, and through the other, life=92s byproducts.

Few caress the corpse, fantasize over inanimate doughy flesh, imagine the
corporeal membrane as something other than former Self, as something else,
anymore than one wishes to drink urine to discover its taste or consider
its other existences. And yet, urine as therapy purports to cleanse,
diffuses the jellyfish sting, and is found on ice in restaurants regularly.
It enters the body, and washes over it.

The Book Arts Center is in a time of transition, yet it wants to sustain al=
l of its critical programming and outreach efforts. You can help by sponsor=
ing us, even in a small way by contributing to our Indiegogo fundraising ca=
mpaign<http://wnybookarts.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3D18afa06692af9=
30f194c20410&id=3De3b035b1a1&e=3D1e49ca8117>. Every dollar donated through =
this campaign helps facilitate education, keep our studio functioning, and =
grow our staff and membership. You can be a part of that by contributing, a=
nd in return you'll get to take home a part of the Center in the form of a =
unique handmade print or book straight from our studio. There are so many g=
reat things to choose from - for yourself, or as a gift for others.

sure to watch the amazing 2 minute video put together by Nate Peracciny, it=
 tells our story in a nutshell.

We want to be able to continue teaching after-school programs with at-risk =
youth, printing diplomas with local Charter schools, running summer camp pr=
ograms for children and teens, and remain a touchstone for local artists wh=
ose work is often marginalized. We know we make a difference, and this is y=
our chance to make a difference too.

WNYBAC is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization. As always, your contributi=
on is tax deductible.

We hope you take this opportunity to partner with us, and build a better co=
mmunity here in Western New York and beyond.

All the best,

DEA2: CALL FOR PROPOSALS FOR VOLUME 3 (2014)
Emily Dickinson=E2=80=99s Reading Culture

=E2=80=9CFor Poets=E2=80=90I have Keats=E2=80=90and Mr and Mrs Browning. Fo=
r Prose =E2=80=90 Mr Ruskin
=E2=80=90 Sir Thomas Browne =E2=80=90

and the Revelations.=E2=80=9D
    =E2=80=94Letter to T. W. Higginson, 25 April 1862

Why should we care what Emily Dickinson really read or about her
relationship to reading, books, and

authors? In Thomas Wentworth Higginson=E2=80=99s Atlantic article for =E2=
=80=9Cyoung
contributors=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94the article that

prompted Dickinson=E2=80=99s account of her reading, oft=E2=80=90cited, and=
 her
subsequent correspondence with

Higginson=E2=80=94he noted: =E2=80=9CFor purposes of illustration and eluci=
dation, and
even for amplitude of

vocabulary, wealth of accumulated materials is essential; and whether
this wealth be won by reading or

by experience makes no great difference.=E2=80=9D For Dickinson, separated =
by
location, situation, and

temperament from the =E2=80=9Cwealth of=E2=80=A6 experience=E2=80=9D that p=
resumably
characterized the lives of many

professional writers, this counsel must have seemed pure balm. If she
could write from the =E2=80=9Cwealth=E2=80=A6

won by reading,=E2=80=9D then, as a dedicated reader, she would be on firm
ground. Emily Dickinson=E2=80=99s reading

provided a vital foundation for her writing.

Dickinson=E2=80=99s reading is also significant on its own merits, however,=
 as
a practice that connected her

directly and powerfully to a community of readers on both sides of the
Atlantic. Dickinson=E2=80=99s reading has

been on the critical agenda since 1966, when Jack Capps published
Emily Dickinson=E2=80=99s Reading, 1836=E2=80=90

1886; it was next taken up by Carlton Lowenberg in Emily Dickinson=E2=80=99=
s
Textbooks (1986). Both Capps and

Lowenberg were engaged bibliographers, documenting the worlds of books
that Dickinson inhabited at

home and at school. But as the idea of Dickinson=E2=80=99s circle has evolv=
ed,
so has the idea of her reading

culture. The recognition of reading=E2=80=99s role in Dickinson=E2=80=99s w=
riting has
led to an explosion of critical interest

in this topic, as exemplified by the special issue on reading in the
Emily Dickinson Journal (2010). As

scholarship on nineteenth=E2=80=90century reading practices, libraries, and
book history has grown, a

reconsideration of Dickinson as a reading writer and a reader is timely.

Volume Three of the Dickinson Electronic Archives 2 will focus on
Emily Dickinson=E2=80=99s reading culture. We

invite proposals for works that examine topics such as:

the circulation of works in manuscript and other informal patterns of
reading and reception;

 the origins, development, and use of the Dickinson family libraries;
 reading in Amherst town and at Amherst College;
 trans=E2=80=90Atlantic publishers=E2=80=99 adaptations to a changing marke=
tplace;
 intersections between women writers and readers;
 periodicals and subscribers in the mid=E2=80=90 to late nineteenth century=
;
 the response to particular books or periodicals among members of
Dickinson=E2=80=99s circle.


Contributions may take the form of essays, bibliographies, timelines,
games, posters, or other genres,

but should contain visual elements.  Visual elements, in addition to
appearing within their native

contributions, will be assembled into a collective exhibition at the
core of the volume.


About the DEA 2:

The *Dickinson Electronic Archives 2* is a scholarly resource showcasing
the possibility of interdisciplinary and collaborative research and
exploring the potential of the digital environment to reveal new
interpretive material, cultural, historical, and theoretical contexts. In
doing so, the DEA2 opens a space of knowledge exchange for a networked
world of scholars, students, and readers by offering a series of
exhibitions on subjects of keen interest to readers of Emily Dickinson.
Each exhibition will offer spaces for commentary that are of different
sorts. At present the *DEA2* offers a *discussion forum*, a space like that
patrons inhabit as they walk through and talk about an exhibition, a space
like that moviegoers inhabit when they stop for a nightcap or late night
snack and discuss the movie just viewed. The *DEA2* also offers *Essays and
Other Writings * for every exhibition we offer.

The deadline for proposals is
September 15, 2013.  Please send proposals of 500=E2=80=901000 words, with =
your
contact information, by email attachment to the volume editor.
Contributors whose proposals are

accepted will be notified by November 1, 2013.  Final contributions
will be due March 31, 2014. The

volume will be released in July 2014.

**Jonathan Berger

http://olivejuicemusic.com/artists/jonathan-berger
Jonathan Berger first heard Major Matt Mason USA perform in 1994. He =20
drove MMM to an Albany Borders Books in 1996. He took Nan Turner to =20
her first MMM show in 1999 and published his column in AntiMatters =20
around the same time. Jonathan Berger was at the first Schwervon! =20

Major Matt Mason stood up to perform. Jonathan Berger has recorded for =20=

Olive Juice Music and cat-sat for Gummo. Occasionally, he writes =20
(Berger, that is).

**Dan and Rachel
http://danandrachel.com/
http://kalerecords.com/
Twisted love-rock duo Dan and Rachel has a wild song collection that =20
ranges from loud dance beats to soft folk tunes, from hilarious =20
commentaries to old-school love songs. Their live performances run the =20=

gamut of human emotion, with songs about bananas, love, social ills, =20
and zombies. Audiences are quick to join in the chorus of =E2=80=9Ctheir =
=20
classic rapid-fire history of the banana.=E2=80=9D (American Songwriter)

Since 2009 they have toured over a dozen countries, playing =20
internationally acclaimed venues including Webster Hall (NYC), El =20
Lokal (Z=C3=BCrich), and the Reeperbahn Festival (Hamburg). They made =
their =20
first album, Damn Monsters!, in 2011.

Their second album, Plus One, was released in 2012 on Kale Records. =20
Dan and Rachel also write songs for the Bushwick Book Club. They live =20=

and grow food in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.

**Steve Espinola and Preston Spurlock
http://paleophone.net/
Steve Espinola is a mostly-piano-playing singer-songwriter, though he =20=

deviates to other instruments. As of late, he is running a boutique =20
artisanal record cutting service specializing in unique "Mixtape" LPs, =20=

described as a =E2=80=9CFats-Waller-shares-a-cigarette-with-Brian-Wilson-=20=

Rossellini-eyes-Stanley-Tucci-in-Big-Night sort of hybrid.=E2=80=9D

http://www.Facebook.com/GoldenRuleStudio
Casey Holford is a Massachusetts-born, Ditmas Park, Brooklyn resident =20=

who has spent the last 12 years playing and recording and listening to =20=

as much music as possible. He's been in a number of bands with funny =20
names, like Urban Barnyard and Art Sorority for Girls, and he has =20
recorded several solo albums and EPs. He produces records for =20
songwriters from his attic studio Golden Rule. He is also an ardent =20

**Major Matt Mason USA
http://www.olivejuicemusic.com/blogs/mmm
Major Matt Mason USA is the name for songwriter/sound producer Matt =20
Roth=E2=80=99s solo music project. Inspired by the homemade tapes of =
Daniel =20
Johnston and the writings of Raymond Carver, MMM=E2=80=99s first =
recordings =20
appeared in self made cassette format around 1994. He as since =20
released 5 full length albums (on CD and CDR) and two 7=E2=80=9D singles =
on =20
Olive Juice Music. 3 of these albums have also been released in the UK =20=

on Teenage Fan Club drummer Francis MacDonald=E2=80=99s, Glasgow based, =
label =20
Shoeshine Records. MMM's music is riddled with influences that range =20
from the paired down songwriting of early Bob Dylan and Neil Young to =20=

the more aggressive elements of The Velvet Underground and Yo La =20
Tengo. Matt is also a member of the bands Schwervon and Kansas State =20
Flower. The DIY spirit is a big part of MMM=E2=80=99s art and lifestyle =
as he =20
continues to carve a niche for himself and others in the ever evolving =20=

stew of contemporary American Folk Music.

**Justin Remer

and sex and pain and stuff. The Elastic No-No Band back-catalogue is =20
available at the above url.

**Todd Carlstrom and the Clamour

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DTPRP5XwzGtI
Todd Carlstrom and the Clamour are an occasional guts-n-glory rock =20
band with a =
http://www.reverbnation.com/toddcarlstromandtheclamourrotating=20
  cast. So rotating, in fact, that Todd will tell you who's playing =20
tonight when we get onstage. The band started when sessions were =20
ending for Todd's Major Matt-produced album, Gold on the Map. What =20
started as a recording experiment (Todd playing all the instruments =20
and writing many of the songs on the spot) had yielded some good loud =20=

results, so he put together a group to play them live. And thus, the =20
Clamour.

**Trouble Dolls .5
=E2=80=94Waitress Song
http://www.troubledolls.tumblr.com
www.29HourMusicPeople.bandcamp.com

release =E2=80=9CSummer Music=E2=80=9D just hit the wireless waves July =
18. By day, =20
Cheri does graphic design-y things, and Pam does science-y things and =20=

entertains notions of quitting grad school. They are thrilled to be =20
performing a song for the Major Matt Mason/Me Me Me Tribute night. Pam =20=

built up her guitar-finger-callouses just for this song, and Cheri has =20=

created a patch for her synth called =E2=80=9CMajor Mattolodion=E2=80=9D. =
Rock on!

A Place for Them is a short play about predatory relationships within =20=

Subject:      On Writing : an occasional series

Back in April, I happened to catch (thanks to Sarah Mangold) the website
for the NPM Daily (http://npmdaily.tumblr.com/), and absolutely loved the
short essays presented on a variety of subjects surrounding the nebulous
idea of "on writing." I would highly recommend you wander through the site
to see the pieces posted there.

Inspired by those pieces, I decided to curate an occasional series of the
same over at the ottawa poetry newsletter
(http://ottawapoetry.blogspot.ca/), and have since posted five short
essays by Ottawa writers on the nebulous subject of "On writing," with a new
essay scheduled to appear every week or so. Given the nature of the ottawa
poetry newsletter, I've been focusing on poets who are either current or
former residents of the City of Ottawa, but am open to considering further
pieces. Over the next couple of weeks, watch for new essays in the series
by Faizel Deen, Pearl Pirie and Colin Morton.

Here are links to the first five, already posted:
