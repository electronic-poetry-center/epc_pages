How to explain a picture to a dead hare*


I will never know the half of you. I will never know the other half of
the other half that has disappeared. I will never know  that that I
walk though that I never walked though. I will be able to never know
half of you whom I will never know. I will never know the other half of
the other half which disappeared. I will never speak about the river or
  another like that I, that I will never know.

torment me-but do not grant me your favors.
drench me in language that dissipates
        leave me nothing
I want to know your definition so I can set it ablaze
        and taste you ashes


I am working on a concept of where I have been
I am working on a concept of where I am so I can destroy it
        along with those object I bought yesterday

I want to know the tree that is the earth in the star forecast dream of
the dreamer in the river lost over the edge of a table that was only a
thought as I turn to you and try to speak


drench me in language that was only a concept of a concept of your
ashes.
I want to know your definition so I can know the dream.

Estrella’s Prophecies





This month you will be called a capitalist.
Do not worry, empty history of its meaning,
so that actions proceeding from entirely
different motives and agendas become
indistinguishable as instances of individual
preference. Call this Speilbergism.
Choose anything for a slogan. No matter
the occasion the cheesiest is the only
choice for your young Chucky. Expect eminent
paving by any domain necessary. Choosy
mothers choose Jif, you unpromoted peanut
eating scum. The upper crust of pro-choice
advocates chose democratic leaders. Cop another
slotted coin and I will tell more, readers.



Be well

Interesting question.

I leafed through Apollinaire's Calligrammes which had a couple of
candidates, but not quite in your sense.

The format came through perfectly on my machine.

Perhaps off topic, but what sprang to my mind was Yeats 12 line poems, like
No Second Troy, which I think of as Shakespearean sonnets without the
couplet at the end, unresolved, irresolute even, the hole in the semantic
scheme very attractive to me.

I wonder what Bob Perelman means when he uses the word "democratic," as he does in this quotation from the interview:

"For me and for most of Language Writers, I think, there is a strongly felt democratic urge.  Language Writing has certainly been accused in the States of being elitist and intellectual.  But throughout the range of forms, tones and genres that Language Writers have used, or are still using, there is a fairly constant sense of trying to sniff out transcendental and totalizing poetic approaches, and to critique them."

Perelman here, as elsewhere, makes a tacit comparison between totalitarian political authority and "totalizing" poetic authorship.

I take it that his real grievance is with writers who will not admit of possible objections to their views.  I assume that he has Pound in mind.

But to focus on Pound is to disregard the great value of "totalizing poetic approaches" within the European tradition: Dante, Shakespeare, and Goethe (to take only the most obvious cases) all offer perspectives so comprehensive as to be "total."

Perhaps it is a mistake to assume, as Perelman seems to assume and as, in fact, most postwar writers assumed, that totalizing poets will always try to legitimate their authority by appealing to political ideologies or orthodox religions.  Shakespeare would seem to be the classic counter-example.

And, in fact, the 20th-century "innovative tradition" contains significant totalizers: Duncan and Dorn might be two important examples.

Democracy is the rule of the majority, and anyone professing a "democratic urge" must of course reject authoritarian political approaches.  But, personally, I read poetry for its authority, even for its authority on political and religious questions.  The notion that authors should surrender an authority that is based, ultimately, on unusual skill in the use of words, doesn't seem "democratic."  It seems like self-immolation.

TRAVELLING LIGHT

From this moment on & forward she will travel light.
Illusions cost nothing & you can fold them small like
after-dinner mints & eat them.

See here, the plot doesn't thicken. It just saunters along,
yes & solo. Because we gotta be quick, we gotta go better
& go. Here's a wrench. You can just tighten the gears.

There are horizons to worry about, neglected archaeological sites,
not to mention the weather.

Who has time for all of this Afternoon of a Faun
and what's it to you? Magic? Forget it.
All done with mirrors.

This may be la dolce vita but even if they are not
looking it just doesn't pay to call a conventicle.

Never mind brass: tack again & stone the crows.

No. Hasn't read Lives of the Saints.

Somebody took her copy of Lives of the Great Poisoners,
but she knows a guy who will get her another cheap.

hilton has sensible things to say here.  i am a very big fan of
baraka's, but he is sometimes off-base and this is one of those
times.  however, there were lots of similar claims being made about
the attack being a zionist conspiracy in emails that were circulating
after 9/11, including claims that Jews who worked in the WTC were
called beforehand and warned not to go to work.

Virginia's guise has shifted from an alarm to a doll
migration has brought imagination neatly
dried & well-bred, red-hot & undisguised, soiled &
taken down
            an honest heart craftily three-score
                               (d---n him!)
several times, to her consternation, his brain had given
            place to fortune, inquiries overgrown with apprehension
this news has gone to decay
shall we pretend the sky killed our pool of blood? I have elbows
not even YOU can dishonor
                               my liberty is drawing toward silence
a season's crime cudgeled into a deep sleep
prayers thus amazed saw each new face in my eyes
I don't have a stick to burn against this cold... what if
Portugal's history asks about me? What then?

I suggest that people refrain from playing this game.  This is an old
dead-end in discussing the conflict in the Middle East, and anyone can play it.

Yes, the Grand Mufti, seeing Germany as an ally against Britain and Jewish
colonization, made his alliance.  It's also true that former Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's Stern Gang attempted to make an alliance with the Nazis
against the British, offering that the Jewish state in Palestine would be
an ally against Britain.  Jabotinsky, Begin's mentor, was an admirer of
Mussolini.  Was there an exploratory investigation to Palestine sponsored
jointly by the German government and Zionist organizations to explore
German sponsorship of the Zionist project as their solution to their
perceive Jewish problem in the 1930s?  Yes, and oddly enough, a medallion
was struck with a swastika on one side and a star of David on the
other.  How's that for a souvenir?  Do certain Arab governments promote
"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" as authentic and not a hoax (and if
anyone knows anything about Jewish religious literature, it doesn't take
much to detect how un-Jewish the "Protocols" are)?  You bet.

We can go on and on.  There are horrible alliances with reasons and
rationales for everyone on both sides.  There are crimes for everyone,
blood on everyone's hands.

Virginia of an Evening Grey

transpose an evening glass grey glass
adagio the evening and adagio

  Virginia,
  the velvet red
  gown, read hot.

the brown? another velvet
jacket paged the page

grey murmuring like a canopy
a grey glass canopy

she, in velvet red or brown
burnished gold furnish against grey.

in morning news monks chant a prayer
another morning's news, chant another

and the glass grey? the pleasant awning
canopy of glass adagio glass of grey

no red chimera and
yet another read hot
the other undisguised

there are no prophets
only those who yearn
for prophecy

and one interpretation grows and
one grows with new interpretation

yearning
an evening
tide grows

and not one interpretation follows another
grows with each interpretation

we yearn.
we recall
yearning.

ride on, ride on: one interpretation delivers
another reveals & seals agreements

there are covenants and there is yearning
for yearning & you are: there. In history
you are.

This poem is "incoherent"?  C'mon, it's pretty damn straight-forward, and he
might just be the most sane one of us around.  It wasn't 4000 people, but
two (employees of Odigo), that were IM'ed the morning of 9/11 about the
attacks, and they contacted the FBI.  The story was reported in Newsbytes (a
subsidiary of the Washington Post) on 27 September 2001.  Baraka got his
"facts wrong" perhaps but is that really what's at issue in READING A POEM
which should NEVER be treated as strictly FACT OR FICTION.  Hyperbole isn't
exactly incoherence, just "artistic license," especially when it comes to
poetry.  And that's what we expect from many great poets, some license,
isn't it?

People talk about paranoid.  Talk talk talk.  If you think the poem is
anti-Israeli (or anti-Semitic), read the poem again.  I think you might
begin to get Baraka's point (if you can read poetry) with the following
word:

    Who


Clearly Baraka is NOT saying the answer to that question is "Israelis."  If
you think that that IS what he is saying, you've clearly missed the point of
the poem.

I'll try again:



    Who killed the most niggers
    Who killed the most Jews
    Who killed the most Italians
    Who killed the most Irish
    Who killed the most Africans
    Who killed the most Japanese
    Who killed the most Latinos

    Who? Who? Who?



He's covering/constructing some sort of archetype out of a series of crimes
over time, as he's covering one century to the next.  Poets CAN sometimes do
this, you know.

The DEVIL.  And the power of the poem is not calling all Xs devils...it
rests within the tacitly prescriptive notion that those who commit horrific
crimes against humanity are that devil.  It is a "pay attention to evil"
poem, and no one does this better than Baraka.  And it is a "you're evil too
if you're part of it" poem.  the poem implicates people of all sorts,
Belgians, British, Americans, people from different times and places.  Our
president George Bush is implicated in this poem.  Bush isn't Israeli.  The
reader is required to have enough imagination to be able to bridge these
seemingly disparate unnamed people together.

WHO?

Somebody indeed blew up America, and somebody's going to do it again, and
they're going to try to convince us that robbing Muslims blind and murdering
them will be the appropriate response.  All we need is the question to
identify them: who?

Who are they going to try to convince?  Who?  And who are "they" exactly?
Who?

In poetry, sometimes the question bears much more "information" than any
answer.

October 1, 2002
"YOU ARE EITHER WITH US, OR YOU ARE FIRED!"

Dear Friends,

I was going to write you a letter about what a pathetic liar George W, Bush
is -- but then I figured, hey, why waste your time telling you something
you already know!

You already know that his planned invasion of Iraq is a ruse meant to
distract the public from the real issues, those issues being the following:
1. The number of people unemployed since he "took" office has risen by 35%.
2. We had a federal SURPLUS of $281 billion when he was inaugurated; today
we have a DEFICIT of $157 billion.
3. TWO MILLION jobs have been eliminated since Bush began his occupation of
the Oval Office.
4. The stock market is down 34% since January of 2001.
5. Another 1.4 million people now have NO health insurance, making it a
total of over 41 million Americans who can't afford to get sick.
6. Only 13 corporate crooks out of HUNDREDS have been indicted, and none of
them have been the close personal friends of Mr. Bush.

THOSE are the real issues facing us, not some phony excuse for a war.

But, like I said, you already know that. You know that Bush is lying
through his smirk when he says Iraq has "weapons of mass destruction." He
has not offered one shred of evidence to prove this. Not one! You know he
is lying when he says that there is a "connection" between Saddam and bin
Laden. Even members of his own administration have admitted that is not
true. It's just one lie after another, and I applaud those three
congressmen who went to Iraq this week and told it like it is -- and
demanded that the sanctions which have already killed a half-million Iraqi
children be ended. Sen. Trent Lott said "they should come home and keep
their mouths shut." I say, we need more damn Democrats with that kind of
courage and with mouths like that!

Which brings me to the real point of this letter. The Democrats.

I have never seen a more lame bunch of cowards and appeasers in my life.
They are ready to bow down before Bush and give him what he wants to wage
war against Iraq. This pathetic excuse of a party is an embarrassment to us
all. The fact that they let Robert Torricelli run for re-election in New
Jersey, knowing how dirty he was, shows just how capable they are of
handing the Senate over to Bush and the Republicans come November. They
have blown it over and over again, and lots of good people I know who keep
putting their faith in the Democrats are just giving up -- and that is the
worst thing to happen in a free society.

What are we going to do? Left to their own devices, the Democrats will not
only hand both the House and the Senate to the Republicans in November,
they will guarantee that Bush gets his second undeserved term in 2004. We
must not let that happen. This year's election was theirs for the taking.
Just look at the state of the union Bush gave us: Bush cronies caught
stealing from the corporate till, Bush and Cheney caught breaking the law
in the '90s, the economy in the toilet, and Bush failing to do the only
real job he had to do since 9/11: Get bin Laden! What a disgrace! Yet the
Democrats could not even find enough candidates to offer a REAL challenge
to the Republicans in nearly 200 House districts for the November 5th
elections. What an appalling excuse of a party.

OK, I know, there is not much we can do about this now. But we all need to
get busy and ensure that this whole rotten system is rocked by the
disgruntled millions come election day 2004. Otherwise, we have no right to
complain.

In the meantime, we must stop the Bush attack on Iraq. We must find out
now, as W says, "who is wid us and who is agin us." I am asking each of you
to please sign the petition I have posted here
(http://www.michaelmoore.com/petitions/peacepledge/index.php) and on my
website (www.michaelmoore.com) informing the Democrats that whoever amongst
them votes for this war, we pledge NEVER to vote for them again. I will
personally see that your on-line signatures are delivered to every member
of Congress.  I guarantee your voice will be heard loud and clear.

Go to http://www.michaelmoore.com/petitions/peacepledge/index.php and sign
the petition to the Democrats: "You're Either With Us Or You're Fired."
Then let's figure out together what we can do to turn things around by
2004.

Thanks for taking the time to do this. We have no other choice.

Yours,
Michael Moore

P.S. The wonderful, heartfelt letters sent to me regarding my mom's passing
continue to fill my mailbox from so many of you. Thank you very much -- you
don't know what it has meant to me. I am sorry I have not been able to be
very active or public in the past couple of months, so please accept my
apologies and my thanks for your understanding. Next week, I have to get
back to work -- it is time for my film to bust its way into theaters across
America. I will tell you all about it next Monday...

Don't know if Andy's fine remarks are in response to my post.  Doesn't
matter.  For me, the emphasis is on a sense of aesthetic democracy.  Perelman
suggests that devices such as self/persona and narrative are present in
langpo.  Surely they are interrogated, as they are in other methodologies as
well.  But interrogation is quite different from obliteration.  Of course we
understand that aesthetic and biz politic strategies are intertwined.
Nevertheless the foregrounding of one or the other is certainly possible as a
focus for discussion.

The issue of totalization is perhaps a more complicated one.  Writers may
shoot for the ball of wax, but they're never going to hit it--never have.
All totalizations are undone from within.  Understanding this, langpoets and
others have re-covered the problematics of this effort to achieve the
impossible.  A writer such as Shakespeare or Dorn, born of their respective
philosophical contexts, leave that exposition to our contemporaries.  Time
marches on, or something like that.  Best, Bill

Apologies for cross-posting

Re the death of Bob Cobbing

The Writers Forum website -now at
http://pages.britishlibrary.net/writersforum/ - is being updated; and it is
planned to put information there about forthcoming celebrations of Bob and
so on, when it is available (Subsequently, it is intended to make it as
comprehensive as possible a record of WF publications - it's already well on
the way)

Give it an hour or two, maybe a day, the changed files haven't yet been
uploaded

There will also be email announcements on some lists, but it is assumed that
the great majority on *this list will not be able to do anything with
detailed information about events happening in London; and we're anxious not
to clutter lists

Anyone who does want to hear full details could let us know by emailing

Patrick, Jim,

Well, hurumph. Perhaps the poem isn't incoherent then (as Patrick
reminds me "hyperbole isn't exactly incoherence"). What a shame. But
I know for sure that reading this poem does not make me think in any
way that Baraka, as Patrick says, perhaps "might just be the most sane
one of us around." And I do think that Baraka must be held as
accountable for the assertions he makes (even in the service of his art)
as those whom he opposes. Even if I oppose many of the same people
he opposes.

I do not know if Baraka himself is anti-Semitic or not. This poem does
not strike me as anti-Semitic. More a problem with semantics, I'd say.
And though Patrick's reading of the poem is helpful, I still find the
poem troubling (and not in a helpful way), as it allows (through its
hyperbole as well as its focus [who is being implicated here by Baraka
. . . but more importantly, who is NOT being implicated by Baraka
here] as well as its factual error) his critics an easy, and at least
partially justified, way to dismiss him and his message, when his
message does have some point. That's why I said "incoherent" earlier.
(I'm now very glad I didn't say "irresponsible" which was my first
reaction.)

By the way, I saw Baraka several years ago with a hot little jazz band.
It was an amazing show, and I thought he worked his material very
well. It troubled me in interesting, helpful ways that I'll not forget.
This poem is simply not of the same stuff, that's all.

Best,
   JG

I think Perelman's interview bridged a number of  disputes. In reality, as
opposed to theory, the 'I" of ego can't really be eliminated, but possibly
it can be displaced. In much of my writing I try to achieve a kind of
immediacy that relates to Sartre's non-egological conception of
consciousness, in which consciousness first perceives, then later postulates
the "I" to organize its perceptions. The  language generated is supposed to
try to capture the movement of consciousness before the "I" can structure
it. Of course, I never succeed completely. It's impossible.

In other cases, I "orchestrate" text so than several different but
indeterminate voices are speaking in contrapuntal harmony or dissonance, as
the flow of words dictates.

You're right. Totalization is unavoidable. Attempts to avoid totalization
(as I understand it) open more possibilities in terms of form, but these
possibilities can ultimately become totalizing elements themselves.

Vernon

Andrew, in response to your question about Perelman's citing of the
"democratic urge" in language poetry, perhaps this will help, a quote from
John Dewey (a favorite philosopher of such LangPo precursors as Zukofsky
and Williams and some of the Black Mountain crowd):

"A philosophy animated, be it consciously or unconsciously, by the
strivings of men to achieve democracy will construe liberty as meaning a
universe in which there is real uncertainty and contingency, a world which
is not all in, and never will be, a world which in some respect is
incomplete and in the making, and in these respects may be made this way
or that according as men judge, prize, love and labor...a genuine field of
novelty, of real and unpredictable increments to existence, a field for
experimentation and invention."

One might replace the word "philosophy" with "poetry" here and begin to
see what Perelman is getting at.  It seems to me that Language Writers
take this sort of basic idea and apply it to syntax, grammar.  This is not
new, really, Stein did it (like Dewey himself, she learned it largely from
William James) as did the others I mention above to one extent or another.
But the Language Writers foreground its political implications in various
ways and this makes language poetry a "new thing" ca 1975-85 or so.

Anyway, this doesn't close the book on what Perelman means (and he himself
isn't culling the idea from American pragmatists) but perhaps it helps.

-m.



 According to Andrew
Rathmann: >
> I wonder what Bob Perelman means when he uses the word "democratic," as he does in this quotation from the interview:
>
> "For me and for most of Language Writers, I think, there is a strongly felt democratic urge.  Language Writing has certainly been accused in the States of being elitist and intellectual.

Andy---

I too read much (if not all) poetry for its authority.
Like I'm reading Dickinson now and then reading a critic of hers
and rejecting the critic's authority and assuming Dickinson's authority---
but subjectivity....is it Dickinson's authority, or my own?
Or the authority of a mood?

Just some questions I tend to think about when reading and/or writing
(and there are many more). The issue of "authority" and "democracy"
is complex, in poetry especially---it does seem that even something
that seems like tyranny, an author's absolutism, might be a precondition
for any truly democratic (if democratic is meant positively)...

I don't think they are incompatible terms...
Like you (I think) I am suspicious of those who
claim not to be tyrants in their poetry....

Just as I am suspicious of
"don't be didactic" or "show, don't tell"
or "don't will or intend anything except chance or the aleatory" etc.
(I think I say this better in my poem "Community Vices")

But then part of Perelman's value (or, hell, I'll even say authority)
for me is that I don't think he thinks democracy is incompatible
with being an authority or even a tyrant in his poetry at least (at times).
I actually think he's different than other lang.pos (say, Andrews) in this.

But then I also don't quite know what you mean when you say
Shakespeare had a "totalizing poetic approach"---
I know you mean that as a positive, but could you be more specific...
it's not at all a given to me.

As far as Shakespeare is concerned, there was considerable work done by
writers like Johnson, the Schlegels, Hazlitt and Coleridge to make him
seem "myriad-minded" to us.  The value of Shakespeare was considerably
different in the early 18th century compared to the 19th (and the US has
invested something again in him).  What we often take to be our naive and
reflexive reading of author is often one that has been prepared for
diligently.  In terms of creating "totalizing" authors (like Chris, I am
not entirely sure what that means and have substituted myriad-minded),
there is much work done by his readers, at least the ones who are critics.

This is why those who are partisans for the "I read literature because it
overwhelms me school" strike me as a little delusional when they profess
to hate criticism.  Or less acidly, they are basically in denial, albeit
perhaps healthy (it is altogether good to feel original).  I however also
feel some distance between myself and those who argue that criticism is
nothing but ideology and authors are reshaped to speak particular ages.
If nothing else, the treatment of Nietzsche by the Nazis indicates that
textual violence is necessary to radically reshape an author.

A proposed middle way, then, might be that authors becomes "authorities"
through the consent of the community.  We have President, but he must be
elected.  (Obvious inference may be drawn.)

MIME-Version: 1.0

I'm interested in finding writings about the poetics of the "authentic
voice" and the presentation of a unified, coherent, presiding authorial
self, etc., especially from the perspective of those who see this kind of
model as a poetic ideal.  One exemplary article that comes to mind is
Stanley Plumly's 1978 "Chapter and Verse" published in two parts in _APR_.

Can someone point me in the direction of other texts?

Thanks!

migration has brought imagination neatly

prayers thus amazed saw each new face in my eyes
I don't have a stick to burn against this cold... what

henry lawson was a republican poet of the late 19th and early 20th century
in australia.
his poetry has been described as a simple bush ballads by 'high' art
critics, and not considered as literary as his short stories.
his writings indicate he was also anti-semitic and anti-chinese.
i see him as australia's first performance poet, he toured for ten years in
outback australia earning his living by his performances and royalties for
his poems and stories.

i've put one of his poems, 'do you think that i do not know?' to blues
music with my turkish baglama, as a flash piece.
this poem was written as a response to criticism from another poet of that
time, ab paterson, 'the banjo of the bush', that lawson never wrote love poems.

the poem to me had its own music and the poem is full of emotion even
though the language may be simple and repetitive.

i offer it for your enjoyment
cheers

At The Beginning of The New Fiscal

I gotta talk about, think about, non-attachment again. I usually prefer to
practice it without the trappings of that name. But when I’m forced to go to
meetings in which my vote and voice is lesser than others, it’s harder to turn
off the heart or heat of passion and get caught up in something frankly
petty---especially as it goes on for 6 or so hours (even if it pretends to be
more of a party for the last 2) for the same reason I prefer not to keep food
in the cupboard or fridge (generally fridge—perishables require less
preparation).
But the stores closing so early (or me getting up so late—since it’s important
to see both sides of the argument, ah comp!) I guess the feeling of what
yesterday seemed like “social disconnection and now seems “social assault”
(hardly hardcore though it sounds like a band) and its attendant “best way out
is through” fantasy strategy has only gotten the house surrounded because the
slackjaw lynchpin of its operations had come up through your inner toilet not
so much as vomit as ACT-UP in the early 90s when chaining themselves to Dan
Rather’s news desk (the rare-live TV footage) circa noon waited until 6PM for
their 15 seconds of fame, “Fight Aids not arabs.” And thus, so the
irresponsible personality I fear losing the reigns of, because attached to
what I called non-attachment (as some others are stuck in willed chance!) may
make a cameo out of the comma I deem a cannonball and license my fool and love
me, if they love, as it does, for the cuddly violence emanating from the
sublime I claim to be taken seriously as the dull priestesses I scorn either
wanting “down with the whole system” or a greater emphasis on classics the
better from which to unsubtle (thank you Jane Ransom). All to say, as budding
and blooming be more violent-seeming than sustaining and slowly reverting to
barrenness, so I must celebrate, if this be celebrate, such repression born
genie from a jar though still eager for the next big earthquake to be done and
over so as to lessen and lesson the threat, even if no spring falls past
meridian in the faith of 40. Yes, to basen, bain the threat, the treat and
trick that is no other but a posture toward otherness and as such the
adjustment will be hot and hazy against the airconditioner itself weird cloud
though that’s chief weird cloud to the them in me

Once Air

the time churls like wild

streamed apart from something seen twice

There is a minding between the risen

has no time

its surroundings are their own disturbance

that is the infinite charge one should think as one twists

the gamut as anvil as a cube leaving the room.


I should approximate once a tangle now

the boat is large, as seen from the shore spread across

too much water.


Time is only impossible    I should think

She is squirming on the only balcony overlooking the busiest steet

in the harbor town

There are not exists.


The lanky holds sway and damn time before heard again

wildly I am I again once speech passed into sleep reaches

thermal borders as only a he would extract part

from who it maintained would become or should you think

the time is familiar

repeating overlook repeating  --  the innocent are a crowd

of vagrants left behind only I can hear a Babylon rumble that is i.e. Early
Mountain's

chiming are not a distraction

a fact in a heart continually the wisest wealth what she sees

she includes a closet her opening all turn to

a tall familiar in the doorway

crowding macro and if only the absence of dust

could shine in the dark filial tree as she closes the door to find

her dark familiar inside

a door closing is a door opened

the minding heart strung wisening such

a contract pursued met

with onlookers only the onlookers disappeared

and were replaced by such appropriates as to conquer

the always newly appearing one trial at a time and

"they should think"  I said the bravest tank of thought is confrontation where
gone I search

around a crowded square of dying earth the lat of

which romances which tangles that perfect unlikely firmament.

infinite rock
void kings oppose taming
stuck together to little glimpses
invisible corpses behind still dead bodies
possesses all nothingness
subject,  its own joy
this a tiny discharge the surroundings didn't accept the straight and narrow
none not air spherical arrivals

the world did specify infinite undoings then
automobiles get smaller, heard in the sea under
inadequate ice

the void is not achievable the subject leeps
he rejoices in a multitude of dungeons under quiet graveyards
out in the desert wilderness
it is memory

fat glides uncontrolable minus gay emptiness after written never
tame surroundings subjects never text stopped out of wakening distant things
nuclear freedoms she had infused wholly
to what they released had been and should not accept

voids are foreign

singular notices singular - the guilty one is lonely
rich men carried forward all but they strain to see a tin shed stand still
without example late plains
silence is a pacifier
illusion on the chlorophyll erratically stupid poor who he feels
he neglects a canyon his closing no-one shuns
short stranger on the horizon
sparse tiny but for a multitude of presence by rock
had darkened out of illuminated roots man if he opens the window in loss
his enlightened foreign surfaces
windows open have been windows closed
careless brain wired dumbly unexaggerated
lies pursuing lost
protagonists a multitude of protagonists appear
or created with no low in defeat
a never old vanishing many acceptances of the void
"let me sleep" they wrote cowardly oceans of body to pacify
in an empty sphere of  living sky a stand in
who looks forward who straightens the disfigured predictable inactivity

I was really disappointed this summer
because the band Hole broke up.
They were slated to go on tour.
I had been waiting for the Korn / Hole
tour for years.

I would recommend The craft of poetry: Interviews from the New York
quarterly
William Packard , Ed. There are many interview that fit what you are
looking for, if I remember correctly, one by Dickey that fits exactly,
plus others. Must have been a late 70's concern, same time period.

I remain, as ever, unsure of splashing early autumnal
laminates
of light around treetops. Pure description is an
object-oriented
programming language based more on prototypes than it
is on
classes; in javascript, one searches for the right
snippet of
piss-stained clouds, wheezing through the hedges we
just bought
and couldn't set up ourselves. For decoration, he's
hung a guitar
over the mantle. The Rite of Spring jangles down a
decline in
teen-age drug use; as ever, I remain uninformed of
grinning
latino workmen, of cul-de-sacs turning heatedly as
debate bends
down with rapacious ease to lie miniscule with the
lullaby's five-
year-old, singing a brand-new requiem for the language
we've
bought and sold. That's bridging dearly. On top of it
all,
metaphysics has no quantum counterpart to spar with;
it just
sits, as you and I do, only dropping another coin in
Estrella's
slot is dripping a mother's canon estrogynous as the
glottis
throttle: pills like freckles dissolve these equations
only so
far, and then I'm left with uncertainty and her
cousin: the
bilious swoon.

A number of people asked for the sourceof the Levinas quote.

I used it in my essay, "Diasporic Poetics" in the anthology, "Jewish
American Poetry" (Brandeis, New England, UP, 2000).   It comes from
Levinas's book PROPER NAMES, Stanford, 1997, but I've misplaced the page ref.

Hope this helps.

Last night-- back to back Poetics phone calls.

J Gallaher called me at 8:45.  He told me he wasn't wearing any underwear,
that he had just been to the gym. I told him I was wearing only a towel and
was preparing to shave. "Shave what?" he wanted to know.  My face, of
course.  Then I was going to hop in the shower.  I love night showers. I
told him I'd been in jury duty for two days.  He admitted to having seen
someone talking on one of those sparkling cell phones. The conversation
wended its way into comedy, Marx Brothers, Hart Crane, Wallace Stevens.  He
has not read the Bergson essay "Laughter," and I think he really should.
His knowledge of clowns is superior.  J Gallaher has a beautiful speaking
voice and is, as you might expect, a quick witted conversationalist.

I called David Baratier at 9:30.  He didn't say *anything* about his
apparel, which came as a great relief. Though he did say he'd been on this
list since 1994, which came as a surprise to me.  "Ah, you're an old-timer"
I said.  We talked mostly about our towns -- his being Columbus OH, mine
being St. Louis MO -- and realized that they are very similar in terms of
'scene'.  I begged him to invite me to something there, because it's not a
very long drive; I also told him I'd like to have him over here sometime.
We need to do a better job of cross-pollinating these medium-sized American
city "scenes." We also commiserated about the challenge of readings
600-page-plus collection of poetry. "All you need is a comfortable chair,"
he said.  I need more than that, though.

Next up is Anthony Robinson. I ran out of time last night.  If anyone else
would like to talk things over, it's kind of fun.  314-781-9690

Ciao,
Aaron

Bruce Andrews' recent books include Lip Service (Coach House, 2001), a

science writing is forthcoming on arras.net.
Homepage: http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/andrews/

Press). He wants to talk about squid.
Bio, bibliography, selected work:
http://www.location1.org/artists/whitehead.html

If we think of Bill Berkson as bi-coastal, it's only because we were so
smitten by his recently re-published collaborative work with Frank O'Hara,
Hymns of St. Bridget & Other Writings (The Owl Press). But, yes, to be fair
to him?and the west coast?he has, for many years now, been one of the Bay
Area's brightest shining stars, with an oeuvre that includes everything from
art writing to the poems and prose of Serenade (Zoland Books). Don't miss
his rare east-coast visit!

out soon from Granary Books. A nice selection of his work can be found at:

August Highland phoned me yesterday morning. We spoke for over an hour. We
spoke about speaking to each other, our respective voices, our accents
(August  thinks my American accent sounds Scottish, but then people think my
son's accent sounds Irish). birth, death, trauma, m.a.g., survival,  various
poets and how good it was to be speaking to each other.

We did not discuss showers or shaving nor even what we were wearing. Thank
god. Nobody wants to hear about jeans with designer rips that put the rip
back in torn. AUGUST HIGHLAND IS A MENSCH!!!!! You lucky people out there
who can just phone anyone in the states without having to consult your bank
managers! Phone August Highland today. You will be so glad to speak to him.

LT

+0044 (UK code) 1856 831 316. That will reach me in St Margaret's
Hope,Orkney. Some people think I am August Highland, but this is not true.
August Highland actually knows William Shakespeare. The William Shakespeare.
And I don't.

Saturday, October 5, 2002 at 3:30 pm
New Experiments: K. Silem Mohammad on Lyric Equivalence
Talk and discussion begins at 3:30, reading at 5:00

K. Silem Mohammad writes: "One objective for this investigation is to launch a
larger inquiry into the definition of lyric as currently practiced by
experimental poets: must voice, for example, or subjectivity, be a part of
that definition, and if so, how have those terms changed historically from
their application in earlier critical contexts? And what about notions of
eloquence and musicality? Must any contemporary engagement with these concepts
be limited by postmodern irony, or can they be used in a progressive critical
discourse within which they are assimilated to a communal (or at least
non-solipsistic) prosodic telos? I will argue for a theory of lyric
composition that posits value not in terms of absolute phonic or rhythmic
qualities, but in terms of contingent and flexible equivalences: imaginary
algebras for the temporary production of pragmatic elegance."
Mohammad is currently Visiting Assistant Professor of British Literature at
the University of California, Santa Cruz. His poetry has been published in a
variety of small presses and journals, and his 2000 Kenning Press chapbook
hovercraft has gone through three printings. He was recently a featured reader
in the Diaspora Poetics series at New Langton Arts.

Carla Harryman tips her hat to Sandburg in the title of one of her books -
and I made no real stylistic connection between his and her work (which I
like) until I picked up Sandburg's Rootabaga Stories recently remaindered in
an illustrated ostensibly oversized children's book with art by Michael Haeu
(HBJ, Publishers). And I bought it primarily for the titles of the pieces.
First published in 1923, they show Carl on first base in the USA in that
little little bump between Dada and Surrealism and the extended shadow of
Lewis Carroll. The Contents page I find worth the price of admission with
titles such as"


The Huckabuck Family and How they Raised Popcorn in Nebraska and Quit and
Came Back

How Six Pigeons Came Back to Hatrack the Horse after Many Accidents and Six
Telegrams

How Dippy the Wisp and Slip Me Liz Came in the Moonshine Where the Potato
Face Blind Man Sat with His Accordion

How Pink Peony Sent Spuds, the Ballplayer, Up to Pick Four Moons

Or lines like, "...the frogs always gamble with the golden dice after
midnight."

Or a sequence of titles as in, "Three Stories About Moonlight, Pigeons,
Bees, Egypt, Jesse James, Spanish Onions, The Queen of The Cracked Heads,
The King of the Paper Sacks."


The stories themselves could have done with some good anti-redundant edits.
But the character whimsy combined with the smarts that animate Carla's work
I suspect here were royally unleashed.

I am out of any Sandburg critical loop - the work here is so different than
the serious democrat at public work (Lincoln, Chicago), I am led to wonder.
Anyone know what sparked this lovely tilt?

Hello. I was browsing archives last month and stumbled across Aaron Belz's
query regarding humor/comedic theory, a query that prompted me to apply for
subscription to the list (mainly because of my interests in the relation of
comedy to ahh "new" writings). I had asked several times in the past to
rejoin discussion, but this is the first time my petitions have been
answered in the positive. So, with this my first post to the list since I
was deleted in late December 1998,  I am grateful to be back.

Aaron, there are a few recent and comprehensible and fairly comprehensive
introductory texts about humor theory in regard to literature. I've read
the following -- and they've been helpful to my understanding, in
particular, of how comedy functions in relation to aesthetically innovative
and politically mobilizing literatures. The first two books should provide
a pretty thorough and readable introduction to the main theories of comedy
and their relation to literature.

- T. G. A. Nelson. Comedy: An Introduction to the Theory of Comedy in
Literature, Drama, and Cinema (Oxford UP, 1999)
- Robert Corrigan, ed. Comedy: Meaning and Form  (1965)

Less about literature and more a breezy intellectual history:
-  Barry Sanders. Sudden Glory: Laughter as Subversive History, 1995
(Beacon Press)

Two titles I've not yet read but are on my shortlist of stuff to read when
I get a second:
- Kirby Olson. Comedy after postmodernism : rereading comedy from Edward
Lear to Charles Willeford (2001)
- Patrick O'Neill. The comedy of entropy : humour, narrative, reading (1990)

Great to be back on the list.

Gabe

Arabs and Muslims to be fingerprinted at US airports
Suzanne Goldenberg in Washington
Tuesday October 01 2002
The Guardian


The US yesterday introduced a sweeping new security regime at its airports
and borders, photographing and fingerprinting visitors from Arab and Muslim
countries.

The regulations, which were denounced by critics as ethnic profiling, went
into effect at all American airports and border crossings.

They require all visitors from certain predominantly Muslim countries to
undergo additional security checks on their arrival in the US.

As their fingerprints are run through computer databanks for matches with
known criminals and terrorists, the new arrivals will be photographed and
interviewed by immigration officials about their plans for their stay in the
US.

If they are allowed into the country for an extended stay, they must check
in with immigration authorities within a month and report any change of
address or job within 10 days.

The measures were initially aimed at citizens of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria
and Libya, all of which are included on a state department list of countries
sponsoring state terrorism.

However, the justice department said last month that the regulations would
also apply to men from Pakistan, Yemen and Saudi Arabia between the ages of
16 and 45.

Yesterday, US embassies in Egypt and Jordan warned travellers that they,
too, could spend their first moments in America being fingerprinted,
photographed and questioned.

"The process is not static. The criteria may change as intelligence reports
change," said Jorge Martinez, a spokesman for the justice department.

He said that as many as 200,000 visitors to the US would be subjected to the
new measures every year, with the numbers of those affected fluctuating
according to security assessments, which will not be made public. However,
he was insistent that the new security regime did not target Muslim or Arab
travellers.

"I can't specify criteria, but it is not specific to any race or religion,"
Mr Martinez said.

Critics say that the measures discriminate against Arab and Muslim
travellers, and create needless airport delays and embarrassment for
travellers who had already been vetted while applying for their visas.

"It creates an illusion of security but does little to produce any results,"
said Hodan Hassan, a spokeswoman for the Council of American Islamic
Relations. "A whole group of people who are already vetted at embassies when
they get their visas, when they come to the country are pulled out of line
and fingerprinted. It's a rude awakening for many, and does little to help
in the war against terror because it creates resentment."

According to a memo from the immigration and naturalisation service obtained
by the Associated Press, immigration inspectors should also examine the
visitor's past travels - and seek explanations for trips to countries in the
Middle East, predominantly Muslim countries such as Afghanistan, Indonesia
and Malaysia, and Cuba and North Korea.

Visitors to the US from Muslim countries already face extra scrutiny. Two
months after the September 11 attacks, the authorities required travellers
from 26 mainly Muslim states to obtain FBI clearance before their visas were
processed at US consulates, delaying travel plans for businessmen and
students at American universities for six weeks at a time.

As many of you know, this year I have been organizing readings around
the world for the UN's Year of the Mountain. The program is called
"Poetry on the Peaks" and I wanted to announce that we have climbed 25
mountains including 5 of the Seven Summits.  The other two will be
climbed later this year.

A few spotlights that will be occurring this week:
Mt. Battie (October 10, 2002) and Mt. Katahdin (October 4-6, 2002)are
being climbed by Rhoda Waller and several college students from Unity
College. They will read excerpts from "Katahdin" chapter of The Maine
Woods by Henry David Thoreau and "Renascence" by Edna St. Vincent
Millay.
Also, the climb to Mount Kilimanjaro will occur this week and the poem
being read " We can't help being thirsty, moving toward" by Mevlana
Jeladuddin Rumi.

Also, we have many photos from the readers posted on the site and news
article from local papers. If you have any questions, please contact me
at 1-212-723-4125 or info@dialoguepoetry.org

northern treehouse

an information-lined treehouse full of coffee, biscuits and fine words and
you are in goggles and gloves. do you foresee all that as we all know that
all that diminishes? all depends on a palpable you can feel alive being
written down in flux. so much about every situation adapts and faces a real
panic and listen now to differences and indifference and differentiation
between the truth and lies which lie like a rug. the scenario and you
plugged into the mainframe. oh! the possibility has had a fantastic,
experience once upon a time but there's red and then there is another
colour, for the sake of argument we will call it blue. and there are lies
and there is plain, not fancy truth and everything fine between his/her legs
and thine. yes. let's say we cannot with and we cannot without and we cannot
withhold because the weather is so exciting.

good isn't it?

fine and splendid like allusions to something underneath illusions alluding
to another and even something underneath all that not moving unless it is
laughing. all of which might or might not open the door, shed a little light
give it some fight and the possibility of something else other than your own
good self mixing the discourses never overcoming a single juxtaposition
and/or a chain links and chains and links shift territory and map the
chartered history all documented in three different and all of them bold,
proud and distinguished dimensions and then some.

indications on the map suggestive of reminiscences inflections seductive
digressions not to mention his/her/their expectations,  the way forward
being not too far behind now almost a dead certainty to be up against and
thereafter right inside the dominant submissive crack-before-dawn and please
avoid the void pick up threads and get back just to follow what was that
thing? remind me. what was that thing again?

call it one thing or call it another or don't call it, it will call you
before it stands you up against the wall at the same time speaking as we are
speaking and sometimes lamenting coming close spin spin again call these the
lights the merry dancers from hell and these lights the merry dancers of
hellish colours the constellations over-lit. well, now.

this is just a phenomena calling itself aurora borealis, otherwise or also
known as northern disturbance lights of perturbance and/or let's just get
those
coloured lights going.  the very lights of the very merry the same and very
dancers was the sky last night. could think it clouds faded strobe pulses
green yellow red yellow pulses pulses and that was the sky last night which
now you have heard not even in this very fine weather a light breeze of
light the reason why perhaps to stay from all directions there is every
light here and there is every light and every light imaginable as light from
every source if only and not

Learn the signs of high blood pressure early. If he
has blood
spurting out his ears, he has high blood pressure. If
heartburn
rusts his inner cildren down to nubbin bumpers that no
longer
function for the nonce, he has high blood pressure.
You can't
stay a cloud forever.

     Hey, get down from there! I said to Brad, who
continues to
coat the corners of the room with his viscous squib.
Cobwebs
bedewed with wedding pictures (hanging like glycerine
drops from
strands just barely audibly breathing) remind us of Y
and its
emancipation from pissing daisies on the dasein of the
tao. Just
let it happen, Brittany continually advises. She's a
beautiful
sieve that lets pouring rugburn through; when she
walks by, sores
tumble out of her gait, like a door's been slit in
metaphor and
all my little gods have become phosphorescent with
melancholy.
Keats, I'm yelling to Brad over Wang Chung tonight,
Keats did not
foresee this. Keats is younger in the corners than
rock bands
crawling out of airplane-drenched groupie formations,
according
to Lakey Teasdale.

     High blood pressure means a well-balanced diet of
the worms
in flaccid roast won't dream about Renee and I in a
restaurant
slowly flooding with bad coffee and the ghosts of
algebra.
Because you can't extract a system from this, it will
pluck a
blueprint from your face. Your network of veinsville
is stressed.

Must we go over all this again.

I can tell. A question re-arranges. Objects on a
table. Until an
answer. Proves. Too much time.

By the way you're looking at me I came back to say.

Yes. You may go out of your mind for an hour or so. It
seems.
Curled, lurking alignment; almost an elemental rule.
Refusing to

Fast. True. Mound.
Lint. True. Mount.
                         Particlepotatoangel.

Much hilarity ensues.

Are. You laughing at.  Me reminds.

Newly re-furbished cognition.

The programme for today's inauguration ceremony of
Columbia University's new president includes

an occasional poem for the event by Richard Howard
(who teaches in the MFA Program).

At the second-to-last of its fourteen stanzas, Howard
pays homage to Kenneth Koch:


                     "A worthier
  candidate to undertake my office
  might have been the lamented Kenneth Koch,
  who more than anyone on earth would spare
       us the delusion

       that poetry is
  merely marble chipped from the classics.  But
  Kenneth's not on earth; I will have to do."

Stephen,

Sandburg is following the long tradition of American homegrown
proto-surrealism.  If you want to read something weird get the Davy
Crockett Almanacs of the 1830s-40s -- there are some facsimiles in
libraries -- the origin of half man/half alligator, incessant masturbator,
cannibal, and a generally insane soul.  Of course, part of its bizarre
extravagance is due to its pathologically perverse racism.  But that is, of
course, the basis of much of American perversity.

Litmus Press has released its first title:

The House Seen from Nowhere, by Keith Waldrop

"In Keith Waldrop's _The House Seen from Nowhere_, we are invited into a
meditational drift that explores the 'tense emptiness' of being.  The
construction of all that surrounds us, the carpentry, wavers between
order and the instability of order, is manifest in syntax and
etymology.  In this house, which is all things--body, fortress,
residence, logic, language, mortality--we find mirrors, echoes and
spirits: "the figures light/delineates not/the light itself."  Where we
might use Zeno's paradox to understand the relation between the knower
and the known, it is in Keith's _House_ that we find the paradox of
'empty distinctions,' the tension between asymmetrical opposites.  The
house exists "not to inclose but/to include//without redemption."

I have been enjoying muchly this interview in the current online Rain
Taxi.  Here is the url:

http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2002fall/shapiro.shtml

I thought I would append this quote which sort of illustrates the title,
"Pluralist Music."  There are many other things here, though.

"My idea of poetry now is pretty endless. I know people who just like Ted
Berrigan's Sonnets, they just like one kind of thing. Particularly because
of music I tend to not think in that way. I like John Cage and I like
Eliot Carter. They don't like each other. I once said to Eliot Carter,
"What do you think of John Cage?" He said, "No I don't really think so."
And the same thing happened when I asked Cage, "Don't you like Carter?"
"No." " What about the 'Polyrhythms'?" "Not really." They both hated each
other, but I think poetry can combine these different things. I like a
sonnet and I like shattering a sonnet. I like The Tennis Court Oath, but I
also like Some Trees. This puts me in a bad position because you might say
I therefore lack certain purities."

The Dewey quotation (thanks Michael) seems, to me, an expression of sentimentality, not thought.  If the democratic world-view is one which perceives universal "uncertainty and contingency," then why is Dewey so confident in the power of men to shape history, or in the legitimacy of their motives to do so?  Robert Corbett mentions Nietzsche: think what he would have made of Dewey's red, white, and blue rhetoric.

I think Shakespeare is a totalizing poet in the sense that he achieves a complete effect, and that, having read him, one retains a certain vision of the world _as a whole_.  The world as a whole (not merely some part of it) looks different afterward.  Completeness, comprehensiveness: I think that desiring these things is actually close to wanting to be, as Robert says, "overwhelmed" by art -- only better, because the effects persist and may be reflected on.

The premise of so much critical theorizing about literature is that artistic conventions carry political significance.  In fact, this significance only exists insofar as it is asserted by the interested parties.  "Let me tell you now about the democratic urge in my poetry..."  When writers adopt this vaguely ad hominem, self-justifying line of argument, it should put readers on the alert.

Which poet was it who said, when asked about his political views, that he votes in elections just like everybody else?  I think of that as a slightly dumb but nicely crap-free response to these questions.

The Liar

What I thought was love
in me, I find a thousand instances
as fear. (Of the tree's shadow
winding around the chair, a distant music
of frozen birds rattling
in the cold.
                 Where ever I go to claim
my flesh, there are entrances
of spirit. And even its comforts
are hideous uses I strain
to understand.
                      Though I am a man
who is loud
on the birth
of his ways. Publicly redefining
each change in my soul, as if I had predicted
them,
         and profited, biblically, even tho
         their chanting weight,
                                         erased familiarity
                                         from my face.
                                                              A question I think,
an answer; whatever sits
counting the minutes
till you die.

                 When they say, "It is Roi
                 who is dead?" I wonder
                 who will they mean?


--LeRoi Jones

fr. *The Dead Lecturer*, 1964

Cesaire, and Antonin Artaud.  He received the National Book Award for
hisco-translation of Vallejo's Complete Posthumous Poetry.  Over the years,
he has received NEA band NEH Translation Fellowships. His translation of

Senghor and L=E9on Damas the concept of n=E9gritude, an influential movement to
restore the cultural identity of black Africans. C=E9saire's ideas were first
fully expressed in his famous poem, Cahier d'un retour au pays natal
(Notebook of a Return to the Native Land ), a mixture of poetry and poetic
prose, which celebrated the ancestral homelands of Africa and the Caribbean=
.
All of Cesaire's writings are in French.

but andy, isn't the fact of publishing itself a broadly ideological
(read political) act?... ergo anything that would impinge upon this
fact would have ideological consequences... i don't think it's a
stretch to imagine oneself as contributing to a more openly
democratic sphere by agitating for work that challenges what one
views as the prevailing orthodoxy (ies)... now these latter might not
be strictly formal, but here again, from ~the ny times book review~
last sunday:

p. 16, from richard eder's review of a. m. holmes's ~things you should know~:

"Over the course of literary modernism and the patchwork of styles
and purposes crowded in since (lacking new ground to build on, the
house of letters, like a Moscow apartment, stuffs the successive
generations into a single cramped kitchen and bedroom)...."

p. 19, from gerald marzorati's review of caetano veloso's ~tropical truth~:

"He has a following, too, among the more with-it tenured types who
participate in conferences devoted to postcolonial studies and such."

p. 34, from will blythe's review of nick tosches's ~in the hand of dante~:

"Fortunately, it's not quite as postmodern as it sounds."

(and yes, each of these reviewers goes on to express ambivalence,
unwittingly i'd say, as to the implied values they're busy
erecting/dismantling)...

if the issue is whether we put faith in our solitary (?) endeavors
(designing a bridge, writing a poem) to the extent that such
endeavors might be imagined to have consequences outside of the
poem's (or bridge's) singularity (let's say), well i would expect the
answer to be yes... not blind faith either, else we'd end up like
poor disillusioned hart crane (hey, i'm not saying i'm "better" than
crane either!)...

raymond williams made the point long ago (forget where) that not all
totalizing gestures are totalitarian... on the face of it this
summons the common metaparadox:  if i argue that contingency is
always good, why this seems on the face of it to be a decidedly
un-contingent view of things... nevertheless, i can say w/o
qualification, i think, that the playing field is not level (in
publishing, and in life) and that one way to correct injustices (of
publishing, of living) is to pursue and promote alternatives that
speak to said injustices (formally and otherwise)... no---i haven't
ipso facto thus created a democratic sphere by asserting so (or
making objects that provide corresponding
objectifications/knowledges)---i'm not even positive that creating a
more democratic/progressive sphere will result in the aesthetic (?)
changes i seek...

but i'd rather not be called to the mat on the basis of my desire to
try to crank open the blinders, yknow (or as if i'm self-deceived or
some such!)... problem with what you seem to be saying, andy, at the
expense of what you seem to characterize as (academic, poetic)
self-righteousness (naivete?), is that *your* position comes at me as
if it already knows better than to believe (let's say) the value of
intellectual work that strives to explore its relation to
extra-intellectual reality (i'm really tempted to use quotes here,
but ok)... all due emphasis on intellectual here too---and which
intellectuality might not characterize, btw, most in the academy
(speaking across disciplines now)...

so:

(1) what do YOU see as the function of poetry at the present time?
but at the same time
(2) you'll have to explain to me as well what you see as the function
of criticism at the present time, b/c it seems to me that this latter
is the space you're taking for granted---the leverage you gain from
not being explicit in such terms...

what i have in mind, btw, is that if you wish to go the
academic-intellectual route, then you'll have to start talking to me
about *teaching*, and not interviews, poems, or other formalistically
conceived artifacts/practices... talking about the effects of reading
is not quite the same as talking about the classroom, which is where
the democractic nexus btw really hits up against some harsh criticism
(despite of which i'll continue to advocate for same, just for the
record)... reading xyz poetry in the classroom is not equivalent,
either, to talking about teaching---it's only one aspect of same,
finally... i'm not sure whether you want to go where i want you to
go, either...

all too hasty, & thanx for reading...

best,

joe

Andy, it seems to me you really misread Dewey here - this may be because
you haven't read much Dewey, I don't know.  He is about as unsentimental
as a philosopher can get.  The Neitzsche comparison is a worthwhile one
though the way you've framed it is misleading.  Nietzsche and Dewey share
a mentor, Emerson (if you know Emerson well you'll see his thinking
prominently on display in The Gay Science, Twilight of the Idols and
elsewhere.  Nietzsche carried his volumes of Emerson with him in his
travels and annotated them heavily.)  As you suggest, they share a
world-view which includes much uncertainty and contingency.  And, yes,
Dewey believes that this is the sine qua non of human agency.  He is also
very specific about how culture is shaped through the actions of groups of
individuals - much, much more specific than Nietzsche to say the least.
"The power of men to shape history" is a phrase more compatible with, say,
Carlyle (or indeed with Nietzsche himself) than with Dewey - in the way
that it suggests a MAN bending the world to his will.  That is not, in my
reading, what Dewey is talking about at all, - rather he's describing, as
William James did, "the idea of a world growing not integrally put
piecemeal by the contributions of its several parts...a social scheme of
cooperative work genuinely to be done." This "idea" *requires* a
philosophy of the kind Dewey describes in my original quote - precisely
because that description, utopian as it is, is rhetorical: it serves to
awaken both disatisfaction and desire, and hence *action*; it suggests to
those who adopt it that they had better not throw in the towel OR make a
monomaniacal dash for power, but should instead proceed antiphonally.

How much more sentimental Nietzsche seems to me by comparison!  How
fanciful, how dramatic his cynicisms, how precociously boyish!  Though I
should say that Nietzsche's love of Emerson has him in good spirits
betimes: "Emerson - Much more enlightened, adventurous, refined than
Carlyle; above all happier...he has absolutely no idea how old he is or
how young he will be" (T of the I).

Two of my personal favorite on comedy are:

Mitchell, William E., ~CLOWNING AS CRITICAL PRACTICE:
PERFORMANCE HUMOR IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC~ (Univ. of
Pittsburgh, 1992)

and (I think)

Desmond, William, ~BEYOND HEGEL AND DIALECTIC:
SPECULATION, CULT, AND COMEDY~ (Albany : State
University of New York Press, 1992).

(As usual, I can't find the Desmond book on my
bookshelves, but I ~think~ that's the title.)

The latter contains such biographical curios as that
Hegel was responsible for the ~toilet-training~ in the
boy's school where he taught, and had to walk the
youngest of his charges back and forth to the
outhouse, in all weather.

Particularly notable in ~CLOWNING~ is Mark Mosko's
"Clowning with Food: Mortuary Humor and Social
Reproduction Among the North Mekeo", about a mourning
ritual.  Through a ceremony of excessive ~over-eating~
where standard aboriginal structural oppositions of
clan lines, sweet and unsweet foods, etc. are
~un-mixed,~ the deceased is ~*de*-conceived~
("Procreation, in essence, is undone"):

"...as the laborers are presented with numerous large
basins of the prepared foods and commanded to eat
them, the overtly comic aspect of ~ipani~ is
manifested.  The laborers start to eat, greedily and
with great bravado.  They eat, and eat, and eat some
more.  Gradually, the laborers' abdomens begin to
swell, and many make a show of intentionally extending
their bellies outward and grabbing and massaging them
so they will hold even more food.  Soon, however, the
laborers' gesticulations, facial expressions, and body
contortions start to reveal momentary signs of growing
satiation and physical discomfort.  Still the laborers
call out for more, more, and more food.
     "...The engorging, clowning, laughter, feigned
anger, and so on continued until both groups of
laborers conceded they could eat no more.  First, the
women lined up in front of the clubhouse, holding
before them four bowls of uneaten food.  The peace
chief's own wife addressed the owners, saying, 'Thank
you greatly, we have eaten coconut and had enough.'
The chief indicated that each of the women was fined
one tin of mackerel and one tin of bully beef.

". . . toward the end of the performances I observed
that the intensity of the laborers' exclamations and
visible efforts to eat more and more food diminished
as they gradually approached their absolute eating
capacities.  Having experienced more than an hour of
eating, the laborers arrived at a point where they
were taking only the smallest of bites, holding and
slowly chewing each in their mouths for as long as
five minutes, say, before taking another.  By this
time their greedy calls for more food were coming less
frequently and forcefully, and their faces betrayed
what can only be described as maximum discomfort.  By
the end of it all the laborers had eaten themselves
into a state of virtual immobility."

restore the cultural identity of black Africans. C=E9saire's ideas were first
fully expressed in his famous poem, Cahier d'un retour au pays natal

i hope this adds something useful to your discussion which i have been
following and trying my best to understand - i don't have the same level of
erudtion as many of you do - so i'm taking a bit of a risk here - what i am
contributing is something lewis lacook wrote about my own writing -  i sound
like a schmuck promoting myself don't i - but i swear this is only a tiny
tiny tiny part of it - i really think what lewis wrote is pertinent - so i
am contributing it
______________________________
NOTES FOR/ON AUGUST HIGHLAND

1) Multiplicity: a political concept:
democracy/socialism: out of
one, many: out of many, one.

2) Highland's work here may on one level be a parody
of the
entire concept of the "art movement;" inasmuch as the
postmodern
has been characterized as "the end of movements" and
an art era
beyond manifestos; Highland, in a bold conceptual
move, has
birthed an art movement, complete with varied
practitioners, from
just himself.

3)It is also primarily an internet art, using the
network as a
means of distribution. In its practice, it embodies
the network;
because Highland takes on for each work a different
persona
(though some workers in the movement are developing
full bodies
of work), he is populating each node in the network of
his
movement with an avatar. This is in contrast to Alan
Sondheim's
work, which operates for the most part with a fixed
set of agents
(Nikuko, Julu, Alan, Azure).

4) What we experience as readers of August Highland's
texts is a
layering of pastiche upon pastiche, collage on
collage, network
on network. The work is dense, disjunctive,
appropriating (it
seems) lines from technical manuals and dimestore
thrillers; its
what pulp would look like if someone dropped the genre
and it
shattered on impact (and if a book on network protocol
were also
already shattered there on the floor, mingling with
the freshly
fragmented pulp). This, coupled with the avatar-play
and its mode
of dissemination lends the work a rich veneer of
polyphony. Think
Schoenberg re-incarnated as DJ Spooky; serialism as a
mode of cut-
up.

5) Such play is deadly serious in its politics. As
Language
Poetry challenged traditional, "transparent" writing,
rendering
the sign opaque, Highland's movement renders
authorship opaque as
well. What if we found out that "Ron Silliman" was a
piece of
software? Would it change the work and our
relationship to the
work as readers?

6) But why challenge authorship in this way? Why
produce texts
like this at all? Why fabricate an art movement?

     One of the things I find most distressing about
the world of
twenty-first century poetics is this: one has favorite
poets, not
favorite poems. This persists even in the world of
experimental
poetics, where ego is routinely challenged, and the
whole idea of
subjectivity often slips under the microscope for
re-examination
(and, in finer moments, re-arrangement). Thinking such
as this
narrows down poetry considerably; it makes the poetry
"scene" all
too often just a smaller version of mainstream
publishing, with
its own small-scale Stephen Kings and John Grishams.

     But why should this matter to the READER of
experimental
poetics? Well, for one thing, it turns this "scene"
into exactly
what it was created in the beginning to counteract: a
market.
Literature once again becomes a commodity; its value
is assigned
to it by author-name, rather than quality of work.
There are a
plethora of respectable experimental literary journals
out there
that publish by invitation only; there's an even
larger number
that "accept submissions," but in reality only accept
work that
has proven market value. How can one justify this, in
a mode of
work that in theory practices openness and
experimentation?

7) This is why Highland's work is important. It
frustrates this
completely; by playing at the author-value level, it's
impossible
for those interested more in experimental poetry's
market value
to grasp it. Will Teddy Warburg ever appear in the
much-esteemed
(and excellent, as far as quality, but closed, as far
as
politics) Jacket? Will Conjunctions ever publish work
by Teddy?
It's doubtful, as such journals seem more concerned
with
perpetuating one particular historical period in
modern poetics
rather than furthering the field.

     So August's work flies in the face of such
thinking. Its
politics are utopian: the constructedness of its texts
is a
remnant of the old punk rock mentality, the idea that
"anyone can
do it, you should too." This work says: start your own
movement.
And many will heed that call.

> The Dewey quotation (thanks Michael) seems, to me, an expression of
sentimentality, not thought.  If the democratic world-view is one which
perceives universal "uncertainty and contingency," then why is Dewey so
confident in the power of men to shape history, or in the legitimacy of
their motives to do so?  Robert Corbett mentions Nietzsche: think what he
would have made of Dewey's red, white, and blue rhetoric.

complete effect, and that, having read him, one retains a certain vision of
the world _as a whole_.  The world as a whole (not merely some part of it)
looks different afterward.  Completeness, comprehensiveness: I think that
desiring these things is actually close to wanting to be, as Robert says,
"overwhelmed" by art -- only better, because the effects persist and may be
reflected on.
>
> The premise of so much critical theorizing about literature is that
artistic conventions carry political significance.  In fact, this
significance only exists insofar as it is asserted by the interested
parties.  "Let me tell you now about the democratic urge in my poetry..."
When writers adopt this vaguely ad hominem, self-justifying line of
argument, it should put readers on the alert.

Laurence I love you too. (Joke).  The post I sent started out as another
"blast" then I decided to pretend to be mad as I (well maybe we (I only?))
are all a bit mad. (Thinkng that the CIA are probably "listening in" but
then I thought ...what the hell...)

  But replying in general. My original post re Baraka was inspired or caused
so to speak by my reading the NY Times which I get on line. Now I was basing
my support of Baraka  In NO WAY on any anti - semitism and I am not anti
semitic and I had heard that rumour re the Israelis  a long time ago and
have never verified it, I must say I am quite skeptical of it (I'm skeptical
of everything)): however it did make me think that certain groups in Israel
may have been involved in the S11 plot but that S11 was organised "frrom the
inside" is at the moment only one possibility. One I'm inclined toward: at
least provisionally... I'm not into the Protocols of Zion and all that
slime: I have struggled for years against incorrect racialist views. My ex
wife was  part Samoan and I used to face racial and psychological torment
(not directed at me) by ignorant New Zealanders that I worked closely
with... who were very often racist (much of the NZ tradesmen class if you
like, and  the "lumpen proletariat",  are rabidly racist: that's another
myth that needs exposing: far from being "a lovely country" New Zealand is
one of the most racist and corrupt and violent countries in the world with a
large percentage of poor people and homeless and neglected old people and
the mentally ill are greatly neglected:and an increasingly low standard of
living): and there is a big number of racist crackpots from anti black to to
anti Asian to anti Jewish here... What  I liked about what I could "see" of
Baraka was his ability to say  " well I'll raise hell..." and I think that
the poem only says - rhetorically..."Who did this?" (I havent read the poem
I dont know where it is I'm going by what Patrick says of it). Why was this
done?" Now what I cant understand is why in the US and elsewhere you are
folding to terror inside your own country that says :" You are unpatriotic
if you speak out or question the anti-terrorist campaign or question the
actions of the Iaraeli military".

My desire to see Israel brought to account and or obliterated
(decommissioned if you like) if it continues on its present course was
changed somehow into I want to obliterate or whatever all Israelis (no
matter what they do): now their was a big conditional there. And I'm not
saying eg that Saddam Hussein is a "good guy" (or even Arafat) ...he's not
as terrible as he is portayed but he is an ant communist dictator (albeit he
did have a (relatively) prosperous regime/situation before the sanctions and
people were doing quite well in Iraq (true personal freedoms are curtailed
and I met an Iraqi recently (who was a communist -apparently they had a very
large and strong communist party in Iraq) but he had to flee Iraq as did his
family who were either communists or liberals) now also not everything that
the Palestinians do is good and if the UN could step into the arena there
and  put the lid on both parties (keeping the US and Britain etc at bay) in
the current conflict then there is hope....Israel...who are colonisers as
Hilton says...but in the absence of that happenning I have to back the
Palestinians in whatever actions they take in their self defence intheir
freedom fighting and in their heroic suicide bombers.  I say  IN THE ABSENCE
OF a negotiated agreement for permanent peace....

I know there are also some  'bad" eggs who are  - stupidly - anti -Jewish. I
am opposed to them. I also oppose anyone using religion as a cause of war.
Holy Wars are stupid from either the West or the East. (I personally dont
like organised religion for what its worth but believe people have a right
to believe what they want).

If Baraka is still anti-semitic I will have nothing to do with him: I have
no time for anti semites or racists (I'm not talking about some rhetoric or
name calling...some of that is harmless: ) but consistent brooding over
"conspricacies such as the Protocols of Zion -which was a fake document is
terrible. I have actually even worked once with a Nazi (in about 1970 in a
wool store) and also a racist Afrikaaner (fibre glass factory) and I know a
Nazi (well he;'s as good as  but I think he is more fascinated with all the
Nazi paraphernalia: hes marrried to a Maori woman who doesnt know what he
talks about!! In fact when he raves about Jews I just ignore him...once we
all contradicted him and he shut up...he's really probably harmless) Also we
a friend and I knwo a guy who wnats to nuke all the Arabs! and so
on....stupid, ignorant people whoi belive violence etc is a solution: peopel
impreessed by power as many were by Hitler who was a scum and a pathetic
piece of human ordure....

If he( Barake)'s using rhetoric to ask questions and  "dog" at the basis of
capitalism and Bush and so on I support him.

But Nick and Alan: I am not in avour of violence I see it always as only a
last resort and I see the Palestinians as desperate; I can understand also
that the Israelis are frightened. I can also understand how Iisrael came to
be what it is; there IS a certain logic to having a strong military and a
"homeland" unfortunately the Israelis did not go about things
diplomatically...but I can see the attraction (especially give the way that
Jewish people have been treated (terribly) by Christian and other
countries...but I'd ike to discuss my thinking on Zionism another time.

I got a bit "short" with Harry Nudel and that was wrong of me...i just got
annoyed: but lets say I'll agree to disagree with him...and Nick and Alan I
didn't want to hurt people who are of Jewish parentage or culture....

But I want to clear this up: I'm not a neo Nazi and ...when I said "pay no
attention" ... I think I was realising that I was actually (in part)
attention-getting...but I'm no Baraka: I couldnt sleep at night with kind of
attention he gets. I hate that sort of publicity he gets, I  mean for
myself...good or bad: he might be JC :I dont know or whatever but my point
initially is(was) still, the same and started with my urging that he not
resign (providing he is not actually an anti-semite, in that case I can see
why people would not want him) and my attack on Israel is stet: GIVEN the
status quo. (Albeit things change rapidly in politics and else)...

Ultimately though I want tose an end to all wars and the disarming of all
nations and a truly prosperous world: that is the solution to conflict...NOT
a utopia, but a greater and more  generous and more egalitarian world.

for Renee

After the fashion of waking
lately, up from walks
and stoops of paving in scale,

we separate at flinch of alarm, rolling
over our own sides of  bed, mostly
still sleeping, but

still sleeping repetitively. I want
to tell you how dreams are recursive; they
function in spools on the end of the night
and wrap whole tones in petulant emulsion,

a wash of green grapes over us as we
stone what's chasing through those haunted
houses we've left already, and shower on
clean socks.  Mine are parental by default;

the teeth familiar, the breath teeming with
pits; no arrival in juicy green flesh but
a withering of inwardness, where protection
means getting away and being alone, and you

play at my edges like a jezebel of seizure.
You ply me with lip readings of the anti-canon,

smooth me into jets of worthy warm gush, though I
resist in my own sustenance, my own cessation

of moving through moons frail as a mammoth, and
sure, I'll eat my vegetables for you. The siege,

begun in bedlam, while fists sifted through
kindergarten and the old banishment routine,

mumbles over momentous ambiance like a beat just

itching to make it to bed with you again.

Thanks for responding to the Shakespeare question. I won't get too deep here at present
but that first sentence to me sounds like you got it straight out of Pound (probably ABC of Reading---it's been years....), and it also seems tautological. The desire to be "overwhelmed," by art, however, "only better, " as you say, makes more sense to me.
But it'd be great if you'd elaborate on what, for you, some of those specific "effects" might be that you reflect on when reading such. Just curious...

As for your second point, of course Shakespeare, who never gave interviews about his plays, or wrote any "ars poetica" statements that were not themselves given to a "character"
(or choral figure, like the "armed prologue" in Troilus and Cressida) in a play, or a "speaker" in a sonnet, and because there have not even been letters or journals by him that have been found, would avoid these charges ("did Shakespeare purposely try to avoid that?"  is a question some have asked) Yet, certain characters, certain speeches, in Shakespeare, do make such claims as well--they're framed in such a way that it's considered "critically
irresponsible" to ascribe such statements to "Shakespeare himself." Sure, they may get lost in the "complete effect" of the work...and to argue about Shakespeare's political or even ethical intention(s), though interesting, often seems besides the point, since the texts seem to be designed largely to be read more than one way....

But most other writers do offer, in one way or another, prose statements or "readings" of their own work, and as you rightly surmise (if I'm reading you correctly), such readings often tend to limit the possibilities of the poem or work in question. I think I agree with you that, yes, we should be war of such statements if taken as the singular truth about the work--"Hi, I'm democratic, because..." or whatever.... I might be wrong but I don't think Perelman
either would want his poetry reduced to that statement. But I also think that such statements are not necessarily absolutely useless, but that they may be put in dialogue with the poems (as well as the statements of other critics on the poems) and that this doesn't have to reduce the poem to the prose statement. Rather, it may be another way of calling attention to the way a person reads their own poems (or, for that matter, the way a poem can read the person
who wrote it), and not merely serve a self-justifying publicity function....

At times at least (though we probably still disagree over which times and/or which poems
allow that), and still think "totalizing" is not necessarily incompatible with "democratic" whether or not you want to hold either of those terms as values...)

The world as a whole (not merely some part of it) looks different afterward.  Completeness, comprehensiveness: I think that desiring these things is actually close to wanting to be, as Robert says, "overwhelmed" by art -- only better, because the effects persist and may be reflected on.

In fact, this significance only exists insofar as it is asserted by the interested parties.  "Let me tell you now about the democratic urge in my poetry..."  When writers adopt this vaguely ad hominem, self-justifying line of argument, it should put readers on the alert.

Gabriel and Jeffrey, (and others before that),

Your input is extremely helpful.  I will print these emails & take them to
the library.

Sometimes I wonder what this list is for, and sometimes it's obvious.

Thanks greatly,
Aaron

Morning in the country of the disappointed, part of my story
with his mate, from which all might not issue, admiration
my dearest light, a new sight to me, how could I enter into
misfortune? hasten my daily fatality, post-road wickedness
uniform voyage, charnel-house mischief, loveliness in a few words
amusements for an instant sway over me, solitary price a murderess
the moon can disturb me, atrocious scene, childless sensations
minutely ancient, overcome by decipherments, completion
palpitated milk and fire, suffocated with part of my story
harmless irretrievables, the prospect of purpose indispensable

Medium, for the moralists, is fictional, generalized counterpart
grand fusion alluded to the above, honor a temporary phase
stagnant retrospection, inattentive utility dividing such
a bliss, or in both, coalescence of exclamations do little harm
bare interinanimation coming between paroemiographers
standpoint isolated the pivot, successive particularization
our home has its overtones, ourselves an undertone
exchange an end for an event, withdrawal incitement
subordinated reformation unstamped indescribables
cruelty enchanted by my travels, her own mind my benefactor

At any rate, ailments seem very like business, questions bashful
unlucky day, to our comfort much expectation, moderation side
drawn to admit easy consolation, a more lasting proposal kept
eight letters: the folds as certain, the main suspect remained
standing, bird on a wire frees telecommunications
public pretense provided with ailments, rigidly productive
handiwork survives adjustment, more often imply habitation
allegiance the most recent benefit, tourist parables
invention stages universality, versatile definition precedes entry
circumstances serve any cause, the unfeasible by way of addendum

Gabriel and Jeffrey, (and others before that),

Your input is extremely helpful.  I will print these emails & take them
to
the library.

Sometimes I wonder what this list is for, and sometimes it's obvious.

Thanks greatly,
Aaron

these aren’t roses      are they

and toss
uninterrupted in bed






2.

resolve to be smoke, sand

a left hand

I’m a trick noon

footfalls, the neighbors’ fighting’s
a relief,       begin again:
a red tin rocket’s whistle






6.

choose your level of involvement:

overrun by the cute,


be estranged, endangered
as a snowflake

22.

what purpose blood

23.

a relief to bubble
        also to pop back
                into place after

being smushed.
        rubber duckie,


        you know—



you’re still the one






24.


sick of your hands


        dusty, meet shaky


kool spires in spotlite


think I’ve missed you
and am missing
        enough action










25.


everything is now John
                     Wieners


fucking winter night!


        give back




        the trees + him







26.

with “the rocks” on the side

and a look that says


“there’s nothing in that
drawer…”




we are tipped by night

ourselves big tippers







27.


you will find out


the color of your heart

the names of lost
      streets


how silver your soul
       is

and needs to be







28.

breaks up
round midnite


every
night the


narrow
asteroid belt of love


watch it!








29.



I would trade truth
        for beauty



and a player to


        be named
                          later







30.

zambonis of desire
clean my ice


later let’s make a
piñata
        and fall out


write my name
across your tits

               all in caps










31.

fake your orgasms

across the wire,

        fake them

at your bus stop.

traffic is good on
      the way back


and all the stars are out.







32.


STOP SHOWING UP
IN MY DREAMS


AND WHAT WAS
WITH THAT HAT?















33.


poundage compounded, don’t
        be misled

        fallen for a fool
                no book unread

        the clouds too can
                     crash

                and seconds burn

     all the while we float
             and also yearn







34.

what do the pale billions
care for me

        caught in the switches

        or a ground ball to
                the whole –


even the poets are
        lawyers, can be

sometimes just in time








35.


drive me around in your
    copcar,

kick and punch me on
   the bridge to Allston,


they haven’t decided
      anything yet,


it’s midnight the jury
               is still out





36.

the blink gen.
are we

and sorry


this is the heart and
lungs and brains

        of the matter

in tired light, an elbow
of a neighborhood suffers










37.







I’d also like to sleep with
Eileen Myles






we wouldn’t have to fool
around or nothin’





38.

I want to love you

but for conspiracies
     and faint thunder

instead run, catch, kiss in
a doorway or crosswalk

                 or sleepwalking

it’s cold, let’s drape my
straitjacket over yr. shoulders









39.


the balance is zero

and you are denied denial


red wisp of a fire engine
headed toward something

that’s burning or burnt

        use envelope for
payment please





40.

don’t have to run anymore

don’t have to pretend
        we’re in a swordfight

        but hey, bust

                the windows
        with your voice

                surrender
or whisper and tempt us












41.

you don’t have to live
like a refugee

live like a moth,
        fly toward the
                brightest thing
                        you can find
                        (i.e.
                              the
                                sun)
fill out a damage form
remove from inventory
and leave a note in my box







42.

plenty of us were
poor and went mad

        with yet no bridge
from which to bellyflop
        pardon its appearance


purple at night and spoked

and if the voices in my head
are right—nah, no way










43.

if at conception, saved,
bobbing between the knees


resolve to be a daughter
or son, be the heated


innuendo of your favorite
        tune


yearn to topple, be not afraid







44.

lose notebooks in the spring
snow and lose them


        one drop at a time
in vicious circles of light


poems won’t endure
the flood or your

own reading of them,
poems pack it in









45.


thus unloved and yet
unfaithful



                pigeonholed,
            tolled, dull as dial tone


     exorcize your legs and arms
               and chest

the damage done
estimates in millions






46.



DON’T MOVE AND
NO ONE GETS HURT



HEY
        I SAW THAT, SLICK


YOU FUCKING MOVED









47.

in ribbons, shining on


to be read in high schools
and who cares if they do


crueler than arrows kisses
are

        be proud of the
        sound, hocus pocus
        lose your focus





48.

to those undead and
unborn

        those dim inbetween


you creatures aspin

        we salute you


     in February and March
     even from far away











49.


get yrself a husband


        before too late



husband to lover


        leave your troubles
                at the carwash





50.

we wish for wicked things
        at the end of tonite


feelin down, dirty, and
        fearing Jesus’ wrath


watch for the entrance
        of love, at its

     scariest, beware
its venomous chompers











51.


and across the firmament

      my one way out

hangs,



                *



        just like that





52.

eureka!

        when we invented
        the angels

        we forgot ourselves


throw me your halo
        and spats

        let’s step out
and never look back










53.

remind me later
           of the edge



        clone me
        1000 times


        and give me
        1000 more of you

on reentry: dead air, slow motion






54.

c‘mon—
         snow with us

      change yourself into
      a twisting ave.
      or a door leaning
      in a lonely alleyway


yr. wings are tall and red

draw back your bow, etc.











55.

I won’t answer
     the ringing phone
          in my head



IT’S PROBABLY YOU
                            AGAIN

                            YEAH
IT’S JUST YOU






56.

allow the forest to fall
into the sea

allow spring, a slippery
fella, in


kids!

drive now to your state
capitols and
       send me a postcard
c/o the zoo












57.

you might or might not
be governor, or a conquering
army of monkeys with red
fezes



BUT IT SURE WOULD BE
GREAT

        IF
                YOU

                        WERE





58.

and so you have a nephew


my vocabulary did this to me


but what’s your excuse


mention it or not, born blue


with a tube around his neck










59.



she is in my arms in the
best poem       ever written







and she is, and this is
it, and fuck! yes!





60.


        too good to be true
        or are you?

        your features, you in smell-
        o-vision.  your future

        is alive in squirming.

        true or false?  this
        blue color is copywritten?

        very true, this blue











61.



wait 1000 years,
        lying along traintracks


or tied up in a field.

in pink pools of cool light
       beneath the milky way


alone, or with a pal, maybe





62.

this is your afterlife, a warped
  treehouse, frosted altogether

and winded.  how long will
  you sit and wait?

        until you run out
        of numbers or pages

      up a corduroy knee
           take a cab or walk

and stay awake if you can











63.

2 roads converged
in a    wood




     we smoked joints
     and took a nap



in the shade, among yellow leaves





64.


I am trying to imagine what
Ron Padgett is doing right
now:







maybe chopping wood with
an old silver hatchet, maybe
eating a delicious slice of pizza











65.


throw your curveballs, test
your slider.


        their bats are corked
        but that’s OK, give ‘em


     fastballs, fastballs, nothing
               but smoke, it doesn’t

count! show them your high heat





66.

the cupboard’s bare here
      and the bills are here
           and the papergirl, too

and Jackson needs braces,

    the dog also needs braces

       there’s shopping to be

            done, but not here
tonite for dinner
a pillowcase, cigarette filters











67.



how to influence:

        a river of yeses and
                    no’s

a whispering campaign:

                          hey,
lie in state beneath your
eternal flame, set up
your velvet ropes, sell tickets





68.

you are back where you
started: the fish market


underlined by cobblestones
the sun insists

and the girls are
wearing sparkles


and you are heavy and
not unhappy, tugged forward











69.


x-rayed for broken bits



without a warrant


back up against the elevator
                        wall
bask in the mirrored gold

quietly ascending to the roof





70.

lose yourself along self-help
and fiction, my sweet
love

browse through bio and
crafts,

at your sleepiest a glow

        of simmering blue

if you weren’t born, we’d
make you up, and name you











71.


and what about me
       not undefeated or
       sought

and not the only Jim
       Behrle around


I wish I was Crispus Attucks,
or among the
saved and loved
no longer, a plaque on a tree





72.

if you had hair, through your
hair like cool fingers


would you go to the prom
with me, if there was

a prom?

FYI: I can’t stop
thinking about you, I THINK
IT’S YOU, and also, for some
        reason, about magnets











73.

the revolution has begun
but you missed the memo


I stole your beret
        elsewhere wolves
        are resting,

        a woman falls for
someone,

and couples double-park
with red and yellow blinkers





74.


YOUR BLUES AIN’T LIKE
                          MINE




MINE AREN’T BLUE




        THEY’RE SHIT BROWN











75.

caught by surprise
overpowered by your








looks, lines, everything’s hazel and

everything’s about you now

hair in ponytails, O good Queen H.





76.

at their most addictive
     the solemn drugs and
         drug-taking of youth


but out in the clear
     stripped of our secrets
         we bob like boys


in cool water without our
     drugs, still solemn
                        to the bitter end









77.

let’s talk in code for
a while:

THE BEAVER GIVES
A DAMN

AND SO DOES THE
PRINCESS


SHE HAS PRETTY
    EYES
AND SPEAKS HIGHLY
OF THE FOX





78.

start over, get an assistant
and saw her in half,

levitate yourself through
      hoops of flame, you


never want to be found,
if you could disappear

you would, or if you
could make them—
          even better










79.

elaborate, the air clear
as cellophane in shimmer

        throw your plastics
        at the sun, up and poof

hold my hand in a movie
        or in the line at the movies


all impurities melt away
  in the lobby, we push out
    back into dusk, movie-dark





80.






and in return a mean flock of
white birds hover.  they mean
to rush us, but we will be
ready.  the moon might be
full from these stairs.  we’ve
run out of time.  there’s no bench,
no wall of ivy along this path.












81.

big brother, little brother

violate your forms!

kick the funny bone!


D to the I to the E

        we all will, but not
        tonight—get one
        more for the road and
one for when we get there





82.

unaware of satellites

monitoring our intimacies

bargaining for more time or
                             for
rain, even at our most

even-headed we allow
lighthouses to guide us to wreck,
legs to overrule minds and arms
and night to fall with all its eyes












83.

well, tell them about her:

        curves and moods
but maybe later, the

stretching red of either

daybreak or sundown
                    distracts

      warm sips of something
all the trees are where they
   should be





84.

build me a new city, I
will build you a subway

    miles of track here
                           to there

    named after some favorites

take O’Hara to Cathedral
change to Baraka at
Stadium, pick up Berrigan
and ride Mayer to the
Operahouse, in evening awash











85.


do it in fever and
be done with it

just headlights and
      lampposts

   and at weekend
          heartbreaks endure

heartbreakers and alphabets

all debts are paid in silk





86.

judge for yourself the distance
to the stars and planets

worrying won’t change it,
what waits for you

   while you check your
   messages

                    is the new sound

not a voice but yeah a voice
that speaks for the zeros and ones











87.

forgive tulips, they know
not why they bloom and rot

     or they do and don’t care
     what it means for us
                to watch

beautiful for a day or two


             become a perfect
stone, fall for the ocean floor





88.


acknowledged.  permission
                          to land

        taken for granted—

        take me to your leader
                or to dinner

in the next town

mobs are being organized,
pitchforks paid for












89.

on a roll—

        elevens, sevens

wake in alabaster
        honey or amber
                awaken and speak

your luck won’t slow you
                          down
not now, change hands
be the dice. snake eyes. bust.






90.


pray to elephants and the whales
for a new love, better
        than the last and

        faithful this time.

        or don’t and take

your chances again in
the pool.
              the water’s fine
NO      IT’S    NOT











91.

calling all supermodels
        submit one poem


or in the skyscrapers
we have left, leave
the power on

                and then
at nine and ten believe
again

trust that steady pulse of yours





92.



seeking relief and a drink
   for courage, left to

   fend through the cut-outs

                escape from
                skylines, crickets,

January, 2000: A DEA government document later leaked to the press [DEA
report, 6/01] suggests that a large Israeli spy ring starts penetrating the
US from at least this time, if not earlier. This ring, which will later
become popularly known as the "art student spy ring," is later shown to have
strange connections to the events of 9/11. [Insight, 3/11/02]

February 6, 2000: India's largest newsweekly reports that it appears a
recent Mossad attempt to infiltrate al-Qaeda failed when they were stopped
by Indian customs officials on their way to Bangladesh. These 11 men
appeared to be from Afghanistan, but had Israeli passports. One expert
states, "It is not unlikely for Mossad to recruit 11 Afghans in Iran and
grant them Israeli citizenship to penetrate a network such as Bin Laden's.
They would begin by infiltrating them into an Islamic radical group in an
unlikely place like Bangladesh." [The Week, 2/6/00] If this shows that
Mossad was trying to infiltrate al-Qaeda, did they make other attempts that
succeeded, and if so, is this how they learned enough to know where to trail
al-Qaeda in the US via the "art student spy ring"?

April 19, 2000: USA Today states that "Israeli crime groups ... dominate
distribution" of Ecstasy. [USA Today, 4/19/00] The DEA also states that most
of the Ecstasy sold in the US is "controlled by organized crime figures in
Western Europe, Russia and Israel." [UPI, 10/25/01] According to DEA
documents, the Israeli "art student" spy ring " has been linked to several
ongoing DEA [Ecstasy] investigations in Florida, California, Texas and New
York now being closely coordinated by DEA headquarters." [Insight, 3/11/02]
In addition to 9/11 connections explored later, was this spy ring meant to
obstruct DEA prosecution of Israeli organized crime?

March 23, 2001: The Office of National Drug Control Policy issues a National
Security Alert describing "apparent attempts by Israeli nationals to learn
about government personnel and office layouts." This later comes to light
through a leaked Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) document called "Suspicious
Activities Involving Israeli Art Students at DEA Facilities ." A crackdown
ensues and by June around 120 Israelis are apprehended. More are apprehended
later. [Read the document here: DEA report, 6/01]

June, 2001: A 60 page internal memo on the Israeli "art student" spy ring is
written by the DEA's Office of Security Programs. [Read the memo here: DEA
report, 6/01] The memo is a compilation of dozens of field reports, and was
meant only for the eyes of senior officials at the Justice Department (of
which the DEA is adjunct), but it is leaked to the press around Dec. 2001.
The report connects the spies to efforts to foil investigations into Israeli
organized crime activity involving the importation of the drug Ecstasy. The
spies also appear to be snooping on top secret military bases. For instance,
on April 30, 2001, an Air Force alert was issued from Tinker Air Force Base
in Oklahoma City concerning "possible intelligence collection being
conducted by Israeli Art Students." Tinker AFB houses AWACS surveillance
craft and Stealth bombers. By the time of the report, the US has
"apprehended or expelled close to 120 Israeli nationals" but many remain at
large. [Le Monde, 3/5/02, Salon, 5/7/02]

June-September 10, 2001: An additional 20 or so Israeli spies are
apprehended between June and 9/11. [Fox News, 12/12/01]

August, 2001: Two high ranking agents from the Mossad come to Washington and
warn the FBI and CIA that as many as 200 terrorists have slipped into the US
and are planning "a major assault on the United States." They say the attack
is from bin Laden, and say indications point to a "large scale target", and
that Americans would be "very vulnerable." [Telegraph, 9/16/01, Los Angeles
Times, 9/20/01] In light of later revelations of a Mossad spy ring trailing
numerous Muslim terrorists in the US, it is easy to see that Mossad would
have known this info. Could this be later disinformation by the Mossad to
spin the spy ring story, or it is another smoking gun showing extensive US
foreknowledge?

September 10, 2001: An Army School of Advanced Military Studies issues a
report written by elite US army officers, which is made public just prior to
9/11. The report gives the following description for the Mossad: "Wildcard.
Ruthless and cunning. Has capability to target US forces and make it look
like a Palestinian/Arab act." [Washington Times, 9/10/01] After 9/11 and
revelations of a large Mossad operating mysteriously in the US, could it be
that the Mossad did in fact do just that on 9/11?

September 11, 2001: Two employees of Odigo, Inc. in Israel, one of the
world's largest instant messaging companies, receive warnings of an imminent
attack on the WTC around two hours before the first plane hits the WTC.
Odigo has its headquarters two blocks from the WTC. The Odigo Research and
Development offices in Israel where the warnings were received are located
in Herzliyya, a suburb of Tel Aviv. Israeli security and the FBI were
notified immediately after the 9/11 attacks began. The two employees claim
not to know who sent the warnings. "Odigo service includes a feature called
People Finder that allows users to seek out and contact others based on
certain interests or demographics. Diamandis [Odigo vice president of sales
and marketing] said it was possible that the attack warning was broadcast to
other Odigo members, but the company has not received reports of other
recipients of the message. [Ha'aretz, 9/26/01, Washington Post, 9/28/01] FTW
Could the message have been a mass e-mail sent to a large group, with only
two brave enough to admit receiving it? Could this be related to the "art
student spy ring?" Did the original senders directly inform the FBI as well,
and if not, why not?

September 11, 2001: The 9/11 attack: four planes are hijacked, two crash
into the WTC, one into the Pentagon, and one crashes into the Pennsylvania
countryside.  At least 3,000 people are killed. A more detailed timeline
focusing on the hours of this attack is given below. According to officials,
the entire US is defended by only 14 fighters (2 planes each in 7 military
bases). [Dallas Morning News, 9/16/01] And "they no longer included any
bases close to two obvious terrorist targets - Washington, DC, and New York
City." Says a defense official, "I don't think any of us envisioned an
internal air threat by big aircraft. I don't know of anybody that ever
thought through that." [Newsday, 9/23/01]

September 11, 2001:  Five Israelis are arrested for "puzzling behavior"
related to the WTC attacks. They are arrested around 4:30 P.M. after having
filmed the burning WTC from the roof of their company's building near
Liberty State Park, then shouting in what was interpreted as cries of joy
and mockery. They were spotted by a neighbor who called the police and the
FBI. The police tracked them down in a van with the words "Urban Moving
Systems" written on the side. [Bergen Record, 9/12/01, Ha'aretz, 9/17/01]
One man was found with $4,700 in cash hidden in his sock, another had two
passports on him, and a box cutter was found in the van. [ABC News, 6/21/02]
Investigators say that "There are maps of the city in the car with certain
places highlighted... It looked like they're hooked in with this. It looked
like they knew what was going to happen." [Bergen Record, 9/12/01] One of
these Israelis later says, "Our purpose was to document the event." [ABC
News, 6/21/02] The FBI later concludes at least two are agents for the
Mossad and that all were on a Mossad surveillance mission. The FBI
interrogates them for weeks. [Forward, 3/15/02] They hold them on
immigration violation charges, before ultimately releasing them 71 days
later. [ABC News, 6/21/02] Their names are later identified as Sivan and
Paul Kurzberg, Oded Ellner, Omer Marmari and Yaron Shmuel. [Forward,
3/15/02]

September 11 , 2001: A leaked FAA memo written on the evening of 9/11
suggests a man on Flight 11 was shot and killed by a gun before the plane
crashed into the WTC. [See the FAA memo, originally posted at World Net
Daily] The "Executive Summary," based on information relayed by a flight
attendant to the American Airlines Operation Center, stated "that a
passenger located in seat 10B shot and killed a passenger in seat 9B at 9:20
a.m. The passenger killed was Daniel Lewin, shot by passenger Satam Al
Suqami." The FAA claims that the document is a "first draft," declining to
release the final draft, as it is "protected information." A report in
Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz on Sept. 17 identifies Lewin as a former member
of the Israel Defense Force Sayeret Matkal, Israel's most successful
special-operations unit [UPI, 3/6/02]. It is a deep-penetration unit that
has been involved in assassinations, the theft of foreign
signals-intelligence materials, and the theft and destruction of foreign
nuclear weaponry. Sayeret Mat'kal is best known for the 1976 rescue of 106
passengers at Entebbe Airport in Uganda. [New Yorker, 10/29/01] Officials
later deny the gun story and suggest that Lewin was probably just stabbed to
death instead (which would still be very interesting). [UPI, 3/6/02,
Washington Post, 3/2/02] Note that Lewin founded Akamai, a successful
computer company, and his connections to Sayeret Mat'kal remained hidden
until the gun story came to light. [Guardian, 9/15/01] What are the odds
that an Israeli counter-terrorist expert would just happen to be sitting
next to the terrorists on this flight, who then somehow knew to kill him?

September 12, 2001: 24 hours after the attacks, the Jerusalem Post reports
that the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem received the names of 4,000 Israelis
believed to have been in the areas of the WTC and the Pentagon at the time
of the attack who had yet not made contact with friends or family.
[Jerusalem Post, 9/12/01] In Bush's address to a joint session of Congress a
week later, he states that "more than 130 Israelis" were killed in the 9/11
attacks. [CNN, 9/21/01] Given that the initial estimates of 9/11 dead
dropped in half from about 6,000 to 3,000, one would expect the 130 number
would drop in half to about 65 as well. Yet CNN will later report that zero
Israelis were killed on the ground (one was on Flight 175). [CNN, 8/29/02]
The notion that Israelis and other Jews in the WTC were warned about the
attacks beforehand has been attacked as one of the most dangerous and racist
of 9/11 conspiracy theories. [Ottawa Citizen, 9/1/02] Clearly, the story has
been exaggerated and too eagerly accepted by some for political reasons.
[CBS, 9/4/02] But given the rarely mentioned Odigo warning (see September
11, 2001), the advanced warning by the Mossad to the US that 200 al-Qaeda
terrorists were in the US and planning "a major assault" on a "large scale
target" in the US (see August, 2001), evidence that Mossad agents were
filming the WTC attacks as they happened (see September 11, 2001) and the
low casualty rate, is it completely unreasonable to suppose that maybe some
Israelis were warned?

September 14, 2001 (approx.): According to Seymour Hersh of New Yorker
magazine, a few days after September 11th, members of the elite Israeli
counter-terrorism unit Sayeret Matkal arrive in the US and begin training
with US special forces in a secret location. The two groups are developing
contingency plans to attack Pakistan's military bases and remove their
nuclear weapons if the Pakistani government or the nuclear weapons fall into
the wrong hands. [New Yorker, 10/29/01] The Japan Times later notes that
this "threat to divest Pakistan of its 'crown jewels' was cleverly used by
the US, first to force Musharraf to support its military campaign in
Afghanistan, and then to warn would-be coup plotters against Musharraf."
[Japan Times, 11/10/01] Note the curious connection between Sayeret Matkal
and one of the 9/11 flight passengers (see September 11, 2001)

September 14, 2001: Dominick Suter, owner of the company Urban Moving
Systems, flees the country to Israel. The FBI later tells ABC News that
"Urban Moving may have been providing cover for an Israeli intelligence
operation." He has been tied to the 5 Israeli agents caught filming the WTC
attack. The FBI had questioned Suter around the 12th, removing boxes of
documents and a dozen computer hard drives. But when they returned a few
days later, Suter is gone (see September 11, 2001). [Forward, 3/15/02, New
Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, 12/13/01, ABC News, 6/21/01]

September 29-30, 2001:  Police in the Midwest stop six men containing
suspicious documents, and then release them. They possess photos and
descriptions of a nuclear power plant in Florida and the Trans-Alaska
pipeline, and also have "box cutters and other equipment." All six also have
Israeli passports. They are let go after their passports are shown to be
valid, but before anyone interviews them. The FBI is reportedly furious
about their release. [Miami Herald, 10/3/01, Knight Ridder, 10/31/01, London
Times, 11/2/01] Again, it appears they may have been Mossad agents. In
addition to snooping on the DEA and Muslim terrorists, some Mossad agents in
the "art student" spy ring have been caught trying to break into military
bases and other top secret facilities. [Salon, 5/7/02] Perhaps they were
gathering information, not planning a hijack, and the box cutters were to
break open locks?

October 16, 2001:  A Philadelphia newspaper later reports that two men are
arrested on this day, after being found with a detailed video of the Sears
Tower in Chicago. Their names are identified as Moshe Elmakias and Ron
Katar. In addition, a woman named Ayelet Reisler is found with them, who has
conflicting identification information. They were arrested for illegal
dumping, using a van with the name Moving Systems Incorporated. Given the
moving van element, and the typically Jewish names, it is likely these three
are part of the Israeli spy ring. The video contains extensive zoom in shots
of the Sears Tower. [Philadelphia Mercury, 10/18/01] Could they have been
videotaping the Sears Tower on 9/11 in the expectation that it would be hit
by a plane? Had Flight 93 not been delayed 40 minutes on the runway and
stayed on course, it would have been near Chicago at the same time as the
other attacks, and it turned towards Washington 20 minutes after the FAA
informed the military that the plane had been hijacked.

November 20, 2000: The 5 Israelis arrested on 9/11 for videotaping the WTC
attack and then cheering about it are released and return to Israel. Some of
the men's names appeared in a US national intelligence database, and the FBI
concluded that at least two of the men were working for the Mossad,
according to ABC News. But the FBI says that none of them had any advanced
knowledge on the 9/11 attacks, and they were released as part of a deal
between the US and the Israel government. After their release they claim to
have been tortured (see September 11, 2001). [Forward, 3/15/02, ABC News,
6/21/02]

November 23, 2001: The Washington Post reports, "At least 60 young Israeli
Jews have been arrested and detained around the country on immigration
charges since the Sept. 11 attacks, many of them held on US government
officials' invocation of national security." An INS official who requested
anonymity says the use of the term "special interest" for Israelis being
held in Cleveland, St. Louis and other places means the case in question is
"related to the investigation of September 11th." [Washington Post,
11/23/01] Doesn't this appear to be more "art school" spy ring activity?

December 12, 2001: Fox News publishes a remarkable report about the Israeli
"art student" spy ring. The report mentions that at least 60 more Israelis
have been detained or arrested since 9/11 and this date. "There is no
indication that the Israelis were involved in the 9/11 attacks, but
investigators suspect that the Israelis may have gathered intelligence about
the attacks in advance, and not shared it." When a governmental source is
asked if the Israeli spies knew about the 9/11 attacks before they happened,
he responds "The principal question is 'how could they have not known?'"
"Investigators within the DEA, INS and FBI have all told Fox News that to
pursue or even suggest Israeli spying ... is considered career suicide." A
highly placed investigator says there are 'tie-ins' between the spy ring and
9/11. But when asked for details, he flatly refuses to describe them,
saying, 'evidence linking these Israelis to 9-11 is classified. I cannot
tell you about evidence that has been gathered. It's classified
information.'" Doesn't that sound like someone trying to convey a
read-between-the-lines message? The report also reveals that Amdocs, an
Israeli company, is recording virtually every phone call in the US and could
be passing information on to the Israeli government. Fox News suggests they
might be using this position to impede the 9/11 investigation. [Fox News,
12/12/01]


December 16, 2001: The Fox News report on the "art student" spy ring is
taken down only two days after being put up, in response to pressure from
the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA), the
Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East
Reporting in America (CAMERA) and others. CAMERA for instance, suggests the
reporter "has something, personally, about Israel... Maybe he's very
sympathetic to the Arab side." Yet there doesn't appear to be any substance
to these personal attacks. The story continues to be mostly ignored by the
mainstream media, but the Fox story makes a big impact inside the US
government. For instance, an internal DEA communique from Dec. 18 mentions
the Fox report by name, and warns of security breaches in telecommunications
as described in the Fox report. [Salon, 5/7/02]

March 5, 2002: Le Monde and Jane's Intelligence Digest discover by this time
that many spies in the uncovered Israeli spy ring seemed to have been
trailing the 9/11 hijackers. For instance, five of the Israeli spies are
intercepted in the tiny town of Hollywood, Florida, and four 9/11 hijackers
are known to have spent time in Hollywood, Florida. [Le Monde, 3/5/02,
Reuters, 3/5/02, Jane's Intelligence Digest, 3/15/02] In one case, some
Israeli spies lived at 4220 Sheridan Street, Hollywood, only a few hundred
feet from where Atta was living at 3389 Sheridan Street. Israeli spies
appear to have been close to at least 10 of the 19 9/11 hijackers. [Salon,
5/7/02]

March 6, 2002: The Washington Post runs a story completely denying the
existence of any Israeli spy ring. It opens with official denials from a
"wide array of US officials" and quotes Justice Department spokeswoman Susan
Dryden as saying, "This seems to be an urban myth that has been circulating
for months. The department has no information at this time to substantiate
these widespread reports about Israeli art students involved in espionage."
[Washington Post, 3/6/02] The New York Times fails to cover the story at
all, even months later. [Salon, 5/7/02] By mid-March, Jane's, the respected
British intelligence and military analysis service, notes: "It is rather
strange that the US media seems to be ignoring what may well be the most
explosive story since the 11 September attacks -- the alleged breakup of a
major Israeli espionage operation in the USA." [Jane's Intelligence Digest,
3/13/02]

March 11, 2002: A newspaper reports that the DEA study on Israeli "art
students" determined the "students" all had "recently served in the Israeli
military, the majority in intelligence, electronic signal intercept or
explosive ordnance units." [Palm Beach Post, 3/11/02]

March 15, 2002: Forward, a major US publication targeting the Jewish
audience, admits that there has been an Israeli spy ring in the US. But,
they say, "far from pointing to Israeli spying against US government and
military facilities, as reported in Europe last week, the incidents in
question appear to represent a case of Israelis in the United States spying
on a common enemy, radical Islamic networks suspected of links to Middle
East terrorism." [Forward, 3/15/02]

May 7, 2002:  Salon reports on the Israeli "art student" ring. All the
"students" claim to have come from either Bezalel Academy, or the University
of Jerusalem. A look in the Bezalel database shows that not a single one of
them appear to have attended school there. There is no such thing as the
University of Jerusalem. In fact, the article points out that the sheer
sloppiness and brazenness of the spy operation appears to be a great
mystery, especially since the Mossad is renowned as one of the best spy
agencies in the world. One government source suggests a theory to Salon that
the "art students" were actually a smoke screen. They were meant to be
caught and connected to DEA surveillance so that a smaller number of spies
also posing as art students could complete other missions. One such mission
could have been the monitoring of al-Qaeda terrorists. [Salon, 5/7/02]
Shortly afterwards, a major Israeli newspaper publishes a story about the
spy ring, but doesn't come to any conclusions. [Ha'aretz, 5/14/02] Could it
be that Israel assisted the US in keeping an eye on the terrorists, thus
allowing the US to maintain plausible deniability and a detachment if there
were investigations on what the US knew?

May 7, 2002: In the middle of the night a moving truck is pulled over for
speeding in Oak Harbor, Washington, near the Whidbey Island Naval Air
Station. The base is the home of the advanced electronic warfare Prowler
jets. A bomb-sniffing dog detects explosives on one of the men and inside
the truck. High-tech equipment is then later used to confirm the presence of
TNT on the gearshift and RDX plastic explosive on the steering wheel. Both
men turn out to be Israeli (one with an altered passport), and in the
country illegally. [Fox News, 5/13/02] However, later the FBI clears the two
men, saying both the dog and the tests just detected false positives from
"residue left by a cigarette lighter." [Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 5/14/02,
Jerusalem Post, 5/14/02] The "art student spy ring" frequently uses moving
vans as cover, and has been caught spying on the most top secret military
bases. [Salon, 5/7/02] In a possibly related story, the Seattle FBI office
that handled this case appears to have been broken into a few weeks later,
and even a room containing evidence was penetrated. [Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, 7/29/02] Does it not appear that the spy ring is still
active, and the FBI is covering up for them and releasing them, no matter
what they're caught doing? Why?

"Madge Herron: Gifted but eccentric poet of the streets"

By Kevin O'Connor, Friday October 4, 2002, The Guardian

Mr O'Connor's obituary article begins:

"Combining the appearance of a derelict bag-lady with a volatile
personality, Madge Herron, who has died aged 86, was a powerful presence on
the London poetry scene during the 1970s and 80s. Her ample, trundling
figure harboured a lyrical voice as potent as Dylan Thomas: "Where the
burnt-out heel of the sky cocks a hind-leg at God there He keeps me." ....

...and continues for a few hundred words. Worth a look.

Electronic Art - the effect of cyber-muse
by Andrej Tisma
http://www.dnevnik.co.yu/Strane/kultdod.htm

translated into english by Dubravka Djuric

 Internet magazine for literature and media art "The Muse Apprentice Guild"
in its first issue presents many prose, and poetry works, essays, but also
the important multimedia works Writes  Elektronic magazines are not rare and
on the Internet there are thousand of them covering different fields. Art
also has its special magazines all over the world, that never appear in
printed version, but they have many online readers. The advantage of these
are multiple: relatively cheap process of publishing and distribuing,
abailability on all continents and in short period of time, flexibility that
permits fast, daily change and adding in content, multimediality with
possibility to enrich pages of the magazine by movable images and sound,
and, finally, with interactivity by which a reader is capable in direct
contact to react regarding the offered material and to effect its additional
shaping, adding, and even the work of the editorial borad.

And although there are so many concepts on which the electronic publications
are based, so we could have an impression that all possibilities are worn
out, thanks to the individuality of the founder and creator of an online
magazine, and this could be absolutely everybody who wishes it, without any
restrictions and boundaries, the attraction of electronic magazines is still
in its freshness and independency. This is the case with the newly
established "The Muse Apprentice Guild" (Udruzenje muzinih segrta), or
shortly "MAG" which first issue has just appearedthese days on the
http://www.muse-apprentice-guild.com/. Its editor in chief August Highland
in his introduction notes that "MAG" is open to all writers and new media
aertists, and that his mark in literary world would like to accentuate by
giving the access to the broader cirsle of different voices, in the spirit
of the development of 21 century. The genres that "MAG" publishes are
poetry,prose, hypertext, essays, critics, interviews, digital visuel and
multimedia pieces, which is extraordinary broad field of creation. This
issue of the magazine brings the works of more than 50 authors, mostly
englesh speaking, authors from USA and from Europe, who write in the already
mentioned genres and creative disciplines. Mostly there are prose texts,
essays, but there are very interesting postry, even few exhamples of visual
play with letters and interpunction. Among them we will notice well known
American essayist, theoretician of postmodernism, and prose writer Lance
Olsen, then well known poet from Pensylvania Ron Silliman, as well as
Bruklin theoretician of cyberculture Alan Sondheim. Marjorie Luisenbrink
well known author of hypermedia short stories has an interesting play of
images and verses "Pomracenje u Luizijani", ans with similar procedures
write Linda Carolli and Lisa Bloomfeild. But the most attractive and most
complex media work in this issue is the work by Doll Yoko (pseudonim of the
movie and video artist Francesca da Rimini) "Liquid Nation with the sequence
of poetic images of children and toys, and documentary images of cruel world
events with engaging textual commentaries, dealing specially with media mass
manipulations, by which the strong effect of experiencing the contemporary
civilization. This electronic internet magazine has many pleasurable
surprices for every taste and the level of creative ambitions and the
deadline for sending the contributions for the next issue of "MAG" is the
beginnging of the November.

Interesting points-of-you arise from this debate. At some point it would be
good to have some feedback from Bob himself. Could it be that he is not part
of this List?   -- DB

Subject:      the Big lie....

  it's not worth going thru P. Herron's list of l...l..l..but i'd like to just
target the two assertions in the Baraka rant...

     1) 5 Israelis were filming W.T.C...who who whoooo...the Mossad who had
just perpetrated the greatest hoax in human history after the J.C.
affair..another Jewish counterintelpro success....send at 4:30 that aft...5
young men to film the results??? the wreckage???the evidence of their
deed????wow hi-tech & smart besides...

     2) 4,000 Israeli workers didn't show up for work at W.T.C...which becomes
that the Israeli Embassy after naming the Israeli dead...under a
hundred...says that 4,000 Isrealis worked in the immediate area...which is
quite possible since i work in the immediate area...which i assume is below
14th ST...there are many Israeli owned shoe/fash biz...which has become a
niche market for talented Israelis with such a small back home base...they
prob. didn't open up...since ALMOST  NO SHOPS opened in Lower Manhattan that
day..including yours truly...

      The big lie is alive and well....the poetic
community....marginal...irrelevant...lower to lower middle
class...semi-brite...is its perfect breeding ground...as are the theories of
po that have come out it recently...you sow what you reap in...DRn.

Subject:      Perelman's other interview
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I haven't got to the interview being discussed so I read the other one =
with Perelman on EPC and I was interested to see his comments and =
interest in diversity and the need for funding and so on: I can agree =
with much of what he says (this was 1995 mind you) and also the point =
that  politics (in all senses I assume) intersects with poetry and he =
mentions the (I call it "the question" or maybe its "the problem" ) of =
rhetoric. Which would bring us to "the Amiri Baraka problem" as here in =
the multiplex of poetic practice we see that black poetry, gay poetry, =
and the whole spectrum of styles and schools are part of a kind of =
"heritage" and an on going debate or discourse which might involve very =
intense or "urgent" discussions or we might be talking about the =
subtlety of language itself and how we all interact with society and so =
on: after all at certain points on the great grid we maybe have say a =
line about the experience of a colour and a fragrance interacting and of =
listening to music or even some strange and intense experience of joy or =
depression due to exreme tiredness or booze or a love affair maybe going =
wrong: love itself is something which is an example of something of =
which it is hard to say it is political: how can love or the smell of a =
flower be a political thing?...but the "packaging of love" etc or the =
presentations of experiences is, or can be, where we "re-enter " the =
social and ultimately the political: now a lot of my own poetry (most of =
it ) is ostensibly non-political: in fact I used to want (still do =
somewhat) a kind of poetry (say like Trakl's - but not exactly like) =
that deals with "slabs of experience" and "contours of words"........ =
but even such poetry (which can often be ambiguous and strange) and, at =
a certain "level' in society, even something say from Longfellow (that =
we all find rather unchallenging) might be considered "strange", =
disturbing and there's a whole spectrum of response to poetry and art to =
 eg the response to Susan Howe's work by even a quite "with it" poet who =
however cant see why such poetry as that by Ammons is not the ticket and =
back to someone who cant see why we should "break" from eg Shakespear's =
sonnets, through to the current debate or debates about language poetry =
and the older "debate" de or re difficulty or the finer subtleties of =
various practices...eg there's some quite fascinating writing going on =
now on the List by Sondheim, and all the others such as Laycock and ..we =
all know the others...and then how or where do these "fit in"...the =
"struggle" of ideas and methods here might be of "personal politics" and =
maybe of schools that are forming or alliances: yet some of that poetry =
might approach to that elusive condition of music: evade social =
definition altogether...after all assuming that one day we do have a =
more rational world (hopefully war free and possibly with people (more =
or less) on an equal footing class wise (if classes even exist)) then we =
will still need art (by art I include poetry and other creative =
activities). That need is almost primal like the need to eat and the =
need for love: the need or deep desire to dance and laugh and so =
on....to talk in fact; the expression of language, of self or selves: =
but "the selves" are made of many unique   beings...maybe we will need =
less cooperative ventures and more individuality.  How many of us want =
our poems jointly signed? (Or are these things mutually exclusive?) Very =
few want to "disapear" but maybe that is a cultural thing - as indeed I =
am very much a product of a "western'; individulaistic culture: I am =
very much an individualist...but again we may see that cooperative =
ventures remain as alternatives and ongoing projects etc

But it is I think certainly desirable that good funding of the arts and =
poetry etc exists and continues and that people such as Perelman and =
others can work in an academic environment: this doesnt swerve away from =
the difficulties of "power" and hierarchies they are always with us...a =
kind of ongoing struggle: but mostly the universities are good in their =
role in spreading and enhancing art and knowledge: which role is a =
powerful thing for the good of individuals and the socious as a whole =
and the future of literature (as well I mean as all other arts and =
liberal studies and the sciences)....I think then that while I can =
countenance certain "wrongs" we see around us if we keep those things =
alive in our art and or just continue to "heighten"' our art that in =
itself is productive toward a (truly) "free society" and I think that - =
despite my allegations of "fascism in the west" ... if we realise that =
those antagonisms are (within the art or lit world) mostly non =
antagonistic and at most (usually) "disagreeative" only (if sometimes =
rightly disturbing) then that is another poetico-politico and also an =
individaulistic (given that the individual is always (always?) a  part =
of the wider social matrix)  way or path to be travelled.

In 1968 the French and Czech surrealist groups stated in the "Platform of
Prague" that: "The repressive system monopolizes language, to return it to
the people only after it has been reduced to its utilitarian function or
turned towards ends of mere distraction.  Thus, people are deprived of the
real power of their own thoughts; they are forced . . . to rely on cultural
agents who provide them with patterns of thinking which naturally conform
to the good and efficient functioning of the system . . . .  With such a
vacuous language, people cannot formulate the ardent images that make the
satisfaction of their real desires absolutely imperative . . . ."

First, how the Bush administration is changing the NEA without

Second, does anybody on the list know if Will Inman, the publisher of

Subject:      Introducing Volume 1, Issue 4 of _sidereality_
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Dear _sidereality_ readers:

I am very pleased to announce another fantastic new issue of
_sidereality_ (http://www.sidereality.com), for we have a number of new
features and improvements on the website. Although you should be aware
that the site will be a work-in-progress until October 15, 2002, much
of the content for the fourth issue is available to the general public
as I write this note. If you happen to spot a problem with
_sidereality_, or if something isn't working for you, please email the
staff at managingeditor@sidereality.com immediately.

First of all, you'll notice that we have a new format. It is my hope
that this format will be an improvement over past incarnations of
_sidereality_, and I encourage you to let us know what you think of it.

Second, we've added a message board to the site! The message board, and
the forums within it, will hopefully help _sidereality_ to evolve into
a truly interactive environment, one in which readers, writers, and
visitors can communicate freely and openly with each other. In short,
we anticipate that a _sidereality_ community will develop over time,
with the message board acting as its foundation.

Third, we will be establishing a _sidereality_ bookstore in partnership
with Amazon.com over the course of the next couple of weeks. Stay tuned.

Finally, here's a list of poets with work appearing in the new issue:
John Amen, Nick Antosca, Michael Arnzen, G. O. Clark, Todd Colby, C.
Nolan DeWeese, Kevin L. Donihe and Pugnacious Jones, Nava Fader, John
Grey, Chris Glomski, Jane Gwaltney, Jeff Harrison, Steve Iglesias,
Jukka-Pekka Kervinen, Stephen Kirbach, Prasenjit Maiti, Camille Martin,
Sheila Murphy, J. D. Nelson, William P. Robertson, Chris Sawyer, Jono
Schneider, Bobbi Sinha-Morey, and Max Strange. Joel Chace is
our "Featured Poet" (please be sure to read the interview with Joel),
and we have reviews by Clayton A. Couch, Steven J. Stewart, and Aidan
Thompson. Steven J. Stewart was also gracious enough to contribute
his "Translation of Selected Propositions from Carlos Edmundo de Ory's
Atelier de Poésie Ouverte" to the new issue.

Thank you once again for being such wonderful readers and supporters of
_sidereality_, and thanks in advance for your patience with the new
features on the site.

Best wishes,

Clayton A. Couch

Dear Poetics List People,

I've been reading a lot of posts lately about readings. They look like
fun events. I see, or am involved in, very few readings because I live
smack dab in the middle of Arkansas. I've been reading to my
daughter and to my cats, all of whom are quite tired of me.

So, here's the proposition: I would like to travel to new places and to
give new readings there. I'm a very hard worker, and I come cheap. In
fact, I'll come for even less than that. Really, actually, I'll underbid
anybody.

And I'll dress apropriately. And I'll be polite.
I'm also housebroken.

If anyone is the least bit interested, I can give you all sorts of snappy
information on myself.

Sincerely,
  J Gallaher

Slam poets have online databases and etc. where they can line up tours.

http://www.poetix.net/poho.htm

There are others -- Bertha Rogers' NYS Littree, for example -- and that
AWP thing (has anyone ever gotten a reading from that?)

Slam poets send out press kits & everything, and they are very, very
persistent.  As are those people who teach weird new age "poetry"
workshops.  This was all quite new to me -- no wonder X at obscure open
mike wouldn't consider allowing me to read -- forget about writing and
publishing -- I don't have a head shot and a demo tape.

It would be nice to have something similar but national; or a spot on
oh, epc, say, where all these readings and people could be listed in a
central location so poets could contact them --

another thing that happens is that right now finding out who is coming
into town anyway -- to visit a relative or whatever or for work -- so
that you can try to give them a reading, too, is quite tricky and
time-consuming.

We need something like a college break carpool bulletin board, too.

Since we're on the subject of crap, Theodore Adorno had this to say: "All
post-Auschwitz culture, including its urgent critique, is garbage. In
restoring itself after the things that happened in its own countryside,
culture has turned entirely into the ideology it had been potentially- had
been ever since it presumed, in opposition to material existence, to inspire
that existence with the light denied it by the separation of the mind from
manual labor. Whoever pleads for the maintenance of this radically culpable
and shabby culture becomes its accomplice, while the man who says no to
culture is directly furthering the barbarism which our culture showed itself
to be."

I feel that at this point in such discussions someone must say something fresh or we'll find ourselves reinventing the wheel or, worse, summarizing our dissertations.  So here's an attempt.

Politics, education, poetry: these three departments of the culture obviously do not have an ideal relation.  For one thing, poetry can have no critical purchase on politics so long as it is a sub-department of education and takes its jargon and outlook from college teachers.  The President does not care that college teachers ridicule him: he and the rest of the governmental elite know that academics occupy an institutional niche and that most of their activity is determined by institutional considerations.  The governmental elite is perfectly justified in ignoring articles in PMLA, just as it is justified in ignoring articles in Dentistry Today or the Journal of Needlwork.  And so long as poets identify their interests with those of the academy, they relinquish any claim to relevance outside the academy.

Now, how could we try to produce a situation in which political elites actually read the works of literary artists?  Imagine if Frank Rich or Paul Krugman, let's say, were given to quoting Julianna Spahr or Chris Stroffolino in their op-ed columns: not as spokespeople for democratic socialism, necessarily, but for their skill at using words.  Perhaps this should not be our goal.  But I have to think that it would be a more desirable state of affairs than holding poetry readings at the MLA -- where you can also thrill to the insights of academic careerists as they drone about yet another forgotten modernist of the Left, the social construction of genocide, or the symbolic transgression of shopping.

Perelman's critical views seem to be those of his profession, or at least shaped by the jargon that his profession authorizes.  I keep waiting for younger poets to orient themselves otherwise.

Dear lewis lacook:

I've very much enjoyed some of your poetry on the list and I appreciate that
you took the trouble to respond to my post. What I am wondering is, did you
read the entire post?

I was responding to Andy Rathman's point which was

>> Which poet was it who said, when asked about his political views, that he
> votes in elections just like everybody else?  I think of that as a slightly
> dumb but nicely crap-free response to these questions.
>>
>> Andy

And to August Highland's point which was

>> One of the things I find most distressing about
>> the world of
>> twenty-first century poetics is this: one has favorite
>> poets, not
>> favorite poems. This persists even in the world of
>> experimental
>> poetics, where ego is routinely challenged, and the
>> whole idea of

>>
>>    But why should this matter to the READER of
>> experimental
>> poetics? Well, for one thing, it turns this "scene"
>> into exactly
>> what it was created in the beginning to counteract: a
>> market.
>> augie

Andy was, I take it, making the point that a writer, in his opinion, has
fully expressed his or her official political viewpoints in the voting booth
just like the average person.  Augie is making the point, I feel, that
perhaps if we poets focused more on figuring out what particular poems had
to offer, instead of trying to market ourselves as personalities who wrote
the poems, the experimental literary scene might offer some relief from the
marketplace politics which we've all grown so accustomed to and perhaps have
unwittingly or consciously conformed to, for example, along with our growing
global corporatism which seeks to predefine our positions on things like
products, and since that works so well, how about elections, wars,
executions, removing civil rights, and freely bombing and killing whoever
our nation might like? Realizing that Theodore Adorno had many things to say
on this topic, I chose a quote to respond to Andy R's glib statement, which
perhaps he might not agree encourages mindless conformism, but for some
reason gives me that impression. The Adorno quote was not meant to encourage
hopelessness. Quite the contrary. I am very hopeful that, like Adorno,
intelligent people like Andy and yourself also want to support independent
thinking and initiative. I feel that Adorno's painful paradox, which
obviously was borne out of his extremely agonized experiences of man's
inhumanity to man, is meant to inspire us to reexamine more fully our
relationship to cultural production as we respond to frightening and
oppressive world events. I have known little bliss since September 11, 2001.
How about you?

Very best wishes,
Nick

Your talking crap: this is a brilliant peice of poetry by Baraka. It asks
great questions that Nudel and Nick (who is still quavering that I dared
question the right of Israell to butcher the Palestinians or the US to bomb
anything it wants becuase of S11 which was probably a "jack up" whoare both
still quavering uselessly in NY and not taking arms not getting into protest
and and TAKING ACTION NOW ) ...this man has balls: this is great stuff.
Long live Baraka.  It is no more incoherent than any other poetry I've ever
read: it has something akin to Gizberg's "America" its not Charles Bernstien
or Nick Piombino but they are different poets (and great poets also) for
christ sakes..but teh .the questions, the rhetoric and the (amaybe a bit
"over the top" Ill concede) are great... I don see any anti-semitism here
this is a cry against oppresion of all peoples.

PROTOCOLS IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, MOST COMPASSIONATE, MOST MERCIFUL

Outside transparent glasshouses powerful reasons accumulate. Syllables
piled at his feet murder illusions benign man left behind on his rug prayers
repeat

There is none worthy of worship except Allah bear witness
that Muhammad is His servant and messenger. La ilaha illa-llah

Bombardments of words fusillade words sucked his mother's breast-fed mercy
humiliation occupation defiance liberation hush-a-bye hush-a-bye sleep sleep

Beneficent god has instituted protection gift of dispersion in the life of
the Jew,
there is no God except God.  Allah dispersed him all over the world. So know
there is no.

God granted us the gift of dispersion to all eyes our weakness save Allah;
ask forgiveness for your sin. La ilaha illa-llah. Save him who bears
witness.

God, La ilaha illa-llah, La ilaha illa-llah from
this comes forth sovereignty all over the world.

Words pitched by history into words of great mystery hard rocks nocturnal
complexity weigh in their hands full of promising hatred. prowl & scowl boys
fight fight fight

True believers are those who believe in Allah and His messenger. The secret
revealed
the hidden hand and doubt not Solomon. La ilaha illa-llah. Such are sincere
lives strive
with symbolic wealth and with Judaism. La ilaha illa-llah, La ilaha
illa-llah. La ilaha illa-llah.

Who are they? Three hundred men each of
whom know all the others govern sly fate.

Whoever dies knowing that there is no one snake worthy of worship.
Allah shall enter paradise. Witness unto detailed scheme. Truth into lives
of men of the nations. La ilaha illa-llah. La ilaha illa-llah.


In the beginning was the word and the word was mark your territory. Words
carved in tablets
of words bowed to the rug thou shall not kill words. Disturb sleep. Moan,
groan attrition.

Save him who peacefully conquers the world, non-Jews, for Zion with slyness.
A snake bears witness unto the truth knowingly. None worthy of worship
except
Allah. La ilaha illa-llah. Such are the secret sincere who penetrate hearts
of nations.

on top of what Saddam can expect, midnight wasn't right. midnight was
slightly dulled, angles of mercy being scented for the future. when the
future arrived, its turmoil shrunk to bite-sized bits. the bitter president
wanted reclining profits and enough time, pure time. an eminent question
loosened one word from a stray phrase that had floated surreal bobbing as a
popularity contest. there must be something here to lose, said the
president. his contrary wavelength was strong in mirth. I am Saddam
something something thru all eternal whatsis, proclaimed antagonism richly.
richly is destiny trying to lasso particles while theory hasn't risen from
bed, the birthplace of adjectives. resultant baggage is blues, as nifty as
the parking space you remember fondly. those days, those pursed lips, those
dalliances with verbs that moved. today, you listen in as headlines go to
work. work will be a long day, even this Sabbath blunder. today we must be
autumn and today we must rule inner expanses of yard work. today is a going
concern, a ghost named Eddie. Eddie was human history, now he's just fucked
up. the president is a retirement fund, and is really fucked as well. Saddam
is a wholesome, whole grain sandwich, the mattress of a bettered world.
someday language will hire us all.

the president doesn't care about most things, it seems, other than
the interests of big business.  however, the corporatization of the
academy and the attacks on affirmative action in universities, the
weakening of the status of tenure and the increased use of adjunct
labor in the wake of books from the 1980s like Tenured Radicals,
etc., as well as the federal waiving of the mandatory age of
retirement for profs do seem to me like direct responses to the
threats posed by the academic left to the government.

Sharon is well known to have been involved with a massacre of thousands of
unarmed Palestinians: I'm not promoting hate and maybe nor is Baraka. He is
questioning: he is pointing things out: and I dont have to incite: people in
Italy are already "incited" and people in Australia and in England and here
and even inside the US and many other countries are protesting these things,
investors are pulling out of the US for the East and Europe...(even Jewish
people I have heard talk against Israel) it is not hate it is what is the
best thing to do. Israel and the US could negotiate and talk but THEY are
the countries (the Govts I mean) who are the aggressors (they SHOULD
negotiate but they are bent on WAR and DEATH of people PEOPLE PEOPLE PEOPLE.
HUMANS! Harry, that's what people are they are; THEY    ARE
H=U=M=A=N=S :   flesh and blood, learn those words at least: learn the word
"human", its not very long but its big...you Nudel must live obsessed with
your right wing views and probably your own hatreds: nothing will come of
the dreams of "the chosen people" that the South Africans also had (there
was always a lot of cooperation between racist South Africa and
Israel)...Israel and  US Imperialism are dreams going very wrong: the only
thing the US has are guns: and guns can be copied very easily: slowly the US
will weaken and collapse into the seething pit of it's own corruption.
Unless the people take note of such as Amiri Baraka and others who know the
corruption: the huge investments in weapons is obscene while poeple die of
hunger in their thousands every week thruughout the world. THAT is violence:
THAT is evil. EVIL! And in Afghanistan after all the bombing there has been
about zero progress with women still wearing burkas and being put into jail
and the leader has to be followed every where by the secret police (US) and
the place flowing with the rejuvenescence of the drug trade and mines are
everywhere for children and others to be maimed by...wherever the US goes
with its guns and weapons death and destruction and backwardness result.
Thank God China has kept the US out. The US will never mess with China. If
they did they would actually have to have a real war...not this gutless
bombing of weak countries and the killing of women and children and anyone
else as they always do. You are obviously very poorly read in political
matters. Richard Taylor.

World AIDS Day is an annual observance on December 1.  At the Ear Inn,
we do a World AIDS Day Reading on the closest Saturday.  This year, it's
November 30.  Over the years, our annual reading has become a community
observance.  Poets and writers who care about AIDS are invited to come
to the Ear Inn and join in the reading.



If we have an overwhelming response, we will have to limit contributions
to one poem of one page or less.  If we have a more modest response, we
can afford to let each person read 2-3 poems.



This reading is not about high-profile name recognition.  It's about
members of the community-the poetry community, the AIDS community,
affected communities, anyone who cares for any reason-to come together
and observe.



Please contact me (back channel) if you would like to join the list of
readers for World AIDS Day at the Ear Inn this year.

Dear Nick Piombino,

And thank you for responding to me...
The quote isn't augie's, it's mine, from a mini-essay
I wrote for him about his work with avatars and
personas...
It's interesting that you bring up Sept 11 in the
context of this adorno snippet, as in reading it I
kept thinking: hmmm, perhaps we should replace
auschwitz with nine-one-one...
Yes, there's hope, of course: even in adorno's
paradox, i think, one can find some hope...(it's
somewhere in the spaces between the two positions
adorno outlines, and also in the realization that it's
not always dual, living...)

I've had bliss since Sept 11, personally (I experience
moments of happiness despite it all), but no longer
feel as comfortable politically with my country as I
was a few years ago...This doesn't neccessarily get
rid of the bliss, but it does make one
wary...Sometimes there's a separation between the
political and the personal, and sometimes there
isn't...

I believe a poet has this responsibility toward
politics: the poet should embody in living all the
ethics she believes in...if the poet feels the world
would go better one way, the poet lives it...despite
outside protestation...so, yes, I read not only the
quote, but some of the adorno (I recognize the
quote)...I just wanted to zero in on that paradox,
because it seemed to offer no solution...which, in a
world after auschwitz, in the context of adorno's
time, yes, that was quite apt....it's up to us to
decide whether it's apt after Sept 11...
bliss to you
(& i've always enjoyed your work)
lewis

all pretties fall into the deep, frenzy got the rent
a quick stupid glove could certainly reach for the gun itself
Dead? - Hardly - we just let up a little.
                   the rifle would like one hell of a pistol
a big fire did follow him
and then farmland cut all around him
                   the brick wall socked in his pocket
                   the courthouse was a wafer on his tongue
Athletics hail into his chair
                   farther down, bounce-soft was gone too
                   the sun sucks blood (it wasn't a big fire)
Jeff was limestone & la pluie qui marche
I tiptoed birdlike, her price like a crystal
the depth fed up with Thy service, all the years did not come any more
                   more money in his pocket &
                   the sun had washed away
the moon looks best in profile, the nasty thing went with my strength
sporting the cracks through all this rain
Virginia in his left hand
                   her hand was waning now
                   seventeen-hundred in the hand
the morning sun kissed his five-fourteen
Just a fire and he waited, he wanted fourteen

well, from today's ~ny times book review~, p. 15, sven birkerts's
review of william gaddis's final novel, ~agap=E9 agape~:

"Reading this, and reading the new book by Harold Bloom celebrating
the cult of genius, I wonder if we might not be seeing signs of
revolt against the long dominance of 'theory' in the literary arena,
an attempt (no doubt doomed) to return the artist to mythic
centrality and to reinvigorate old assumptions about hierarchies of
excellence."

this what you have in mind, andy?...

not me, brother...

but maria's point really is to the point:  if you believe that
academe is irrelevant to literary-poetic culture---or should be---you
may miss the way believing so plays into the hands of bush culture...
the ultra-right wing of the republican party will, on the one hand,
dismiss as irrelevant (and irreponsible) all that goes on in the
humanities, and on the other hand, do their utmost to subvert same...
while (as we know, most of us) waging war under the auspices of
questionable verities (please not to be taken as a pro-hussein
sentiment)...

but the real threat to literary culture (etc.) might not be from
right of center (i'm speaking as a leftist, yes, and with due regard
for body bags)... as (the late) bill readings argued in ~the
university in ruins~, the real threat may result from emptying the
new university of excellence of any real ideological (nation-statist)
fundamentals... transnational rhetoric  and associated forms of
materiality are real good at this, and at pretending there's nothing
"out there" that can't be assimilated... as readings argued, this
might be no worse than the former situation---but it's certainly no
better... and it probably bodes poorly for anything that can't be
appropriately quantified (or generate positive pr)...

so whatever absurdities you may locate at mla, andy, they pale in
comparison to the outright laugh riot of watching bill bennett types
snorkeling such (yes, troubled) waters, hoping to surface with a
handful of crackerjack prizes that they can then point to as evidence
of postmodern torpitude, while the hits just keep on rolling...
yep---as in "let's roll"...

so:  if there's some other institutional reality that you think poets
would be better off exploiting, please---as a poet (tut), i'd love to
hear more... or perhaps you believe that the bardic impulse doesn't
require good eats to keep that inspiration alive & kicking? (we would
in that event be well advised to wish each other well, and be on our
ways)... or maybe there's already a poet-model that (whom) you'd
point to as, well, sanguine, under the circumstances?... in which
case, and in the interests of departing from what we all apparently
know to be the case (you wrote "someone must say something fresh"
etc.), i for one would honestly want to hear more, believe me...

best,

joe

I have returned from a business trip to discover that a virus is =
rampaging an old e-mail account of mine. If you receive any strange =
e-mails with an attachment , or any e-mails from my old account =
seanjane@clarityconnect.com DO NOT OPEN IT!!! IT IS A VIRUS!! This virus =
goes through the e-mail address book and sends itself out in wily ways. =
If you have McAffee anti-virus software, it seems to be able to disable =
the settings and continue to send itself out.  I am very sorry for this =
and I hope that nothing like this comes your way. The virus has the =
words "KLEZ" in it.

Best of luck,

THE FLATTENED MISSIVE



hyper extended pharmaceutical elaborations. the slinky delinquishment(sic) appeased. consider the dimension when frothing the poisoned flounce. equate the rumpled partition to its opposing hilt. the coffee bean undressed. a smooth allowance toward an accrued spittoon. a breeze filled day. the puncture found at window’s edge. where words fall off and plummet. or ground up mathematics. rendered lifeless. food stock for the lesser human. lesser? no triangulation achieved begins to distinguish the angle’s perfect attainment. gross overage surrounds us. the crank undulating near the furnace is hiss. a thermal affluence. hawk eyed altitudes find molecular bumping, elemental thumping, atomic humping. street sign logistics. a fanciful plague of niceties caricatured by hurled doilies of pornography. a rubber acquaintance. the drivel of routine alcoholism. the mounting purpose gelled to unknown certainties - an impossibility, standing in front of the thrift store. waiting for buses in!
 the wind. a cajoling, a clarity of juniper. the sestina of brazilian herbs. aero liners shut down. we are scrutinised by terror. a deliberate observation slept and slipped through a slot. a
tenderness whirling unnamed. poor poor rhapsodic adhesive.



her tone arm lightly. the anticipation of sonic erotica. lips sprayed with the captured breath of the now dead. leather binds keep her in place, in position. the speakers mounted on the ceiling of the gymnasium blare out the weather. weaved into every book is a hair from the top of
the head. love is that much. excruciating. a thimbleful can eliminate the world. radio appendage tuning in the azure of this uglier dictionary. it is an elaborate sojourn with built-in acquaintance, something stealthy, and socially quirky. the pool table is a directional disappointment. a scrimmage of fathoms sporting around on your campus. a flag happy curmudgeon dribbles the flecks slowly from his once tightly clenched hand.



what restrains a super power after guilt has lost its charm. the sleek exterior of splayed softness. a dixie cup dispenser of oblivion, little morsels, little meds. ablutions of the mind as an egregious religious ritual. as a window sill is a place for elbows, so should a beach be a
horizontal wonderment without the diesel fumes of military aggression. an ultimate reprise written into historical text. some twist, some wisdom-strap holding things in place. not as is, but what will! the future of coagulation is calm entropy. it’s true, spikes of activity are
unstoppable. only out of chaos does order emerge, not the other way around. the new poster is a phoneme. the new couch is a bubble. war, my dearest, is the open air and how it occurs. how is a wolf to cease hunting? it cannot. no animal is better or less enlightened than any other. horticulture is a neighborhood of sleeping. wake your dreams. johnny b. goodie. the pleasure of jump ness. bridge of thwack. if it digits, will it gidgets? gadgets? targets? the quiver shakes the very area. an unplugged brain is more dangerous than any taxpayer. I am flurries. the zeal of atonement. try to kill not or try something different for once. newspapers are new no more. same old same old. blood
everywhere and then the clean up.



the herald, the mounted crown of mountain laurel, meet the solipsistic era. same as the old solipsistic era. the curmudgeon apostrophe dangles over the still water of wafers. almost derisive this flattened missive attuned to the crisp frequency of obliteration. cough, cough. the plumage decorates the inner lung of alfonso. neon fiancee of squeegee brothel. autumnal barks down the block, twig infested columns lean into dark. the yo-yo, the yum-yum, the ping pong of dust. from me to you, from me to you, from me to you, oops the shiver of non obstructed valence. a hover buoyant reality. you will harness vitriol for
generating an appliance. a kite too. a benjamin, a franklin. one hundred assumptions painted in dollar green ink. a puzzle of offerings. a channel of faucets. a sung pulley of adroit varsity sportsters. a found
subscription of literary rareness. from vignettes to new jersey. the overage is destined for somewhere between pause and off. off now. off now gone. off now gone bye. see ya. a solipsistic devil slips through your destiny. there you go. a repetition of utterance. the utter silence of repeating it. it deletes itself.



zaumist children chalk drawing in the corner. appeal of shiny commercials to the smaller digits. you have learned how to place your silverware. now you fidget over your spare change. gazing, wafting, high mirth in a can. those pencil sketches of old new york. pre nines, pre elevens. pre teens have lessened for now their crazy rage, but wait. but wilt. but wont you shake the nascent bones and ‘lectric akimbo production of how all knowledge alights on the forehead of those in preparation of sudden termination. kinda nuclear. kinda spiritual.



addendum

the brutality is floundering as excessive ad campaigns lose their sting and vitality. a beautifully proportioned finch delicately immersed in a vat of albumen. and war, my dear watson, has become a human necessity. as with current musical trends, they too find the power of a miracle a mere bonus feature. available, attainable. not knowing the tsunami of applause, martha seeks moisture, as martha is anyone. logging on is our financial privilege, is our culture of dominance. as we achieve dominion over it, it will be our undoing. and then the return of the trance and
its unstable politic. the means by which we meander, by which we become blind but to the singularly offered beam of light. and this intended beam is not a discovery, not a found brilliance, but the fabrication of the temporary ability to mute brain functions. to suspend mentality. to
freeze logic. to under whelm the nervous empire. how else the beast to sleep. how else this program delete. and war is the knowing, the depth of plunge.

Would I be wrong in suggesting, there seems to be an assumption by both
sides of this rather heated (and sometimes disappointingly personal)
discussion that the 'voice' in the poem is Baraka's. OR EVEN MORE
FUNDAMENTALLY - that it has a voice and is not polyphonic. It seems to me to
slide unnervingly between conspiracy theory, prejudice and a whitey's on the
moon (gil scott heron) stance - but it never stays in one camp for very
long. Just a thought.
Baraka is good at pushing buttons - last time I saw him (just post election)
he had a poem that from memory went "You may call him Ralph Nader, I call
him ralph traitor" or some such - As an outsider I can see how anti-bushness
could drive you into the arms of what's-is-name the democrat, but surely
Nader was about challenging 'them' - something the writer of the poem in
discussion should support. But knee-jerk emotions get the best of the best
of us. Don't they?

And I meant to add - there are some interesting septmeber 11 pieces on Steve
Earle's Jerusalem - recently out. Maybe a rebirth of vietnam poetry?
(aparently he's got a book of short stories out too) Anyways couple of good
songs - John Walker Blues is one. There's also an interesting intro to the
disk on the sleeve where he talks about being the 'loneliest man in america'
It's all kind of an anti-mindless-jingoism piece - refreshing in the face of
other pop-rock responses.

you don't know about this war. you have your bible with you and a lock of
your girlfriend's hair. you have a picture of your family. you have a
picture of the farmhouse. you carry these things around with you in a
leather wallet. they're almost unreal and you hope they won't be left here
when you die. smoke rises a hundred yards down the trench, part of the
wall has caved in. you can smell fire. you dream at night, anything but
this. you cry when no one's looking. you can't remember anything clearly,
that's the worst of it. occasionally a scrap of conversation, something
your father said. you remember the touch of your girlfriend and that last
kiss. there's not much of your world left, and there's nothing here. you
rise out of the trench, you rise. last night they were saying there's a
bullet meant for each of us. too many men are already dead. you can't see
skin without seeing the wounds, you know what's beneath the surface. you
swear at the lieutenant who sent you out here, but you know that's what
he's supposed to do. your canteen's already useless, the canvas torn, the
aluminum punctured. you borrow one from the soldier next to you. he won't
be needing it any more. sprays of dirt fly overhead as the shells come
closer. you can hear screaming mixed with everything else. how can you
prepare for the incision, the removal of the bullet, the attack comes but
once, you're left in the trenches, you're cold, you smoke a cigarette.
there's no energy in the letter from your girl, but it's all you have and
it's already worn through, what are you going to do. the earth's in front
of you, behind you - the trench opens, up and down the line, there are
many others like you, and the sound is indescribable. you can't think and
you hold on to the letter. you hear the sounds of bombs in the distance as
aircraft fly overhead. you know someone will bring heavy artillery in, and
there will be soldiers manning the guns just like yourself. you can't
remember much about home, and the landscape here has disappeared - just
blasted trees and raw earth. there's a stone farmhouse in the distance.
these are the worst days, when the sky is dark and damp, when the mist
falls, soaking everything. you smell lignite and mold. you don't think
you're ever coming home. susanne graham

i don't have the field, the space, to write, to rewrite, properly, to
contain the words, ascertain the exigencies of the concepts, internalize
them. this is writing on the margins of writing; this is writing on the
move, writing on walls, the scrawl, the scribble - there's no time for
anything else. this is the theory of the inscription, the cut, the
incision. this is my life's work under the signs of illness and poverty.
this is the begging for another month, another day, another hour. this is
the moment of the last rite, unfulfilled promise. this is everything from
the world already gone, it's gone ahead.

i can say i've seen it passing by at high speed. i've almost caught up
with it. there are times i sit, sometimes when i sleep, it's almost in my
grasp. but it continues, the ontologies are radically different;  there's
no way the hand holds on, no way the eye sees, the ear hears. it's gone
before i'm awake, before i have a chance to move, before i have a chance
to stand, to write. it's gone before the next meal, gone before the
worries of staying alive.

there's not a day that i haven't felt ill for the past several months.
there's not a day i haven't had shaking, slight thought, chills, but a
reminder or remainder, always present, an uncontrollable shuddering. the
writing and the reading proceed in pain; recently, they're taken over by a
dull anger that things have to be this way. i'm waiting for the moment
when everything breaks - when i can catch it, hold it in my hands, place
it within the context of the book or essay, video or video-speech, the
gestural movement of the arms, the fingers dancing on the keys, evanescent
sounds. it's all the case, it's all the case of all of us, it distorts,
crumbles, without lack of further evidence, financial stability; my theory
is a theory of stress and poverty, the theory of rising painfully in the
morning, crashing sleepless at night, imbecility of it all.

at night i lie awake waiting to capture or entrap it, but as i've said
repeatedly, it continues to elude me, playing with my consciousness,
already exhausted, until it appears at the periphery of my vision or
whispering to me, just for a second, an instant, and then it's gone, and
there are the lyings-awake and walkabouts until it appears again, often
within the same night, stuttering as the frames of a film stutter, as if
there were continuity to my work, as if it could be held down into the
form, taking on the semblance of the form, corrupting and distorting just
on the verge of wakefulness into pain, the theory or essay or book, the
coherent thought, the gesture fully carried through, the boy and girl
with broken arms

Virginia rose, a veritable rose

not unrestrained or despised, the arrogance of some and beg
others not do not shoot but merely DO NOT PULL THE TRIGGER
ON THAT GUN there are differences subtle and trivial as they might
seem even if they aren't really visible to the naked eye. And forward
never backward into the breach and joined the revolution. Quietly, if
you recall, she actually never spoke beyond the established perimeters,
broadened them, yes, even removed them in some instances, displaced:
DON'T HEM HER IN. The frontispiece never toiled over, nurtured
beyond the vanitas vanitatum colouring the day:  never mind the long
hot summer or the night kitchen, never mind insinuations of Grievous
Bodily Harm based on an unfortunate incident with a carving-knife.
Sir, do not underestimate the implications of concealed weapons
revealed. Fire not a shot in the dark unless you know your target
isn't moving. Not counting the stifled laughter, the velvet counter-
pane shaking amongst the ermine trappings, each with a lining of silk,
each gown white chiffon and every successive Sabbath heightened
by the silver chalice and the wine. Oh! A woman of valour full of the
ignominy of white and dry with a fruity bouquet  knows her due and
her traits descended in frenzy from the grandmother you call a  mere
retrogression. Sir, had you not noticed her temples? From generation
unto generation the ice melts. In colours. The ice melts and spreads the
colours wide from both sides into the backwardness you think so forward
and shoves the forwardness into the breach. The scene was seen and held
in abeyance. This is the shorthand of her long fingers. Her hands. And
contested not. There was no contest, only the sealing of agreement between
friends. Only the sealing of an agreement like fulfilment of the long
engagement. Thirty years an engagement? Fie! Fie! The thirty years' war to
end all but she rose from the trenches a rose. And conveys her kind regards

Dan etal.  Harry and Nick and Alan are people I respect although ok I'm
laying into Harry a bit but he can take it....Harry is just coming from a
different angle, his politics and mine collide....now I have only seen that
poem by Baraka (havent read much else although I have an old book by him as
Lee Roi Jones)...I dont see it as being quite as simplistic as you say:
however its not eg like even the kind of poetry I mostly like: I think what
makes it "good' if it is is the times and the social situation and so on
...that is when where and to whom it was written: I can guess that Baraka is
an attention getter (but I dont see him as anti-semitic when he cools
down)...as I am myself (I mean I am probably an attention getter)..as we all
can be: I know he was arrested and jailed for inciting people to riot
(appparently driving around in a car with a loud hailer inciting people to
come out and riot!!)  I incite people to think about the issues: (and people
on this List either disagree with me or ignore me in droves!!) I've fired
off my salvoes: Ralph Nader is probably a bourgeios (how do you  spell that
cursed word?!) liberal but better than the other lot...it makes sense to
have a broad base, and I - although I would like to see some positive and
permanent long term changes toward some kind of state that is _ in actuality
_ ruled by the people (and all means of production)  - I know that in the
meantime we all have to live with reality of Bush and the main politics we
are used to: that said we dont have to agree about whether or not to discuss
Baraka and S11 and so on. Its been fairly heavily thrashed: but these are
"heavy" times, for everyone, I simply dont want to see any more wars. And so
on. Hilton O. knows more about these issues  than me.

As to Baraka's poetry as I say it seems to me a bit like some of Ginsberg's
such as  "America" - Ginsberg is good - but he doesnt interest me so much as
a poet (as do the NY poets the Language poets etc etc etc)....although I
suppose the point somewhat about Ginsberg is his poem is/was for the times
and he asks why Vanzcetti had to die (parallels  Baraka's refererence to the
Rosenbergs) and so on: he was protesting as a homosexual and as a young
white male and a poet and so on ...he is aware of anti-semitic America (and
the anti-semitic world)...for its context a good poem and maybe we can see
Baraka's in its context.

And for some "dark" political poetry that is protestant (maybe  not quite as
strident) have look at some of Ed Dorn's work...well the one I know is best
is "Abhorrences" ..... look I think that Nick etal are very concerned about
these issues as i am but dont want to be "trapped" into the kind of
stridency of distorting language that people can get into and I think a lot
of people know that: I can see  that too: and  I'm probably more "angry with
history" (Ashbery) than any individual.... but then its probably stupid
getting angry...concerned is better; then act and not talk so much Richard.
Or do both, or neither.  Cant solve the world's problems: surprise!  But Dan
its that good you "inputted".

Maybe we should get Baraka, Charles Bernstein, Nick Piombino, Harry Nudel,
Arielle Greenberg, Aaron Beltz, Mohammed Ali, Sharon, Arafat, Saddam
Hussein, John Walker (not NZs runner the other one) (by video if allowed),
Patrick Herron, Ron Silliman, Alan Sondheim, Kent Jonhston etal, Kevin
Killian, Wystan Curnow, Susan Schultz (and various other female writers of
the approroiate ilk or kind), tom raworth, John Ashbery, Chris Stroffolino,
Harold Bloom, Harold Pinter, some homeless  guy from about 47th street NY,
my mate Jim the Ant who hates "Theocracy", David Antin, Barret Watten, Bruce
Andrews, Britney Spears, Colin Powell, Milosovich, John Travolta, Billly
Graham, and a few others to debate the issue at a forum!! With heavy
security for the opposing parties and Bibles, glossy mags, Korans, copies of
the Language Theory and works by Kristeva and Susan Sontag and Derrida
(maybe Sonntag herself), Perloff, Helen Vendler, the shades of Eliot and
Pound, (and maybe Pope and Swift and Montainge and Dante and even Browning
thrown in) and in person hopefully:Oliver Sacks, Richard Dawkins: with big
scientific, and French and German Theoretical poetical Tomes (ranged against
the entire works of Harold Bloom) at 20 paces...

Amiri Baraka's Somebody Blew Up America
Poetry as Treason?
by KURT NIMMO

It seems you not only have to be careful what you say, as White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer warned last year, but also what you write,
especially if you are an African-American poet with a Muslim name and
Marxist politics.

On September 19, Amiri Baraka, an influential beat poet and founder
of the Black Arts Repertory Theatre in Harlem, read a recent poem,
"Somebody Blew Up America," at the 2002 Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry
Festival at Waterloo Village in Stanhope, New Jersey. Note the
following lines from the poem:

Who knew the World Trade Center was gonna get bombed
Who told 4000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers To stay home that day

Why did Sharon stay away?

Since Baraka read his poem in September, popular news commentators and
powerful political organizations have called for the revocation of his
status as poet laureate of New Jersey, an honorary title which pays him a
modest salary of $10,000 per year. Even though he wrote the poem last
October, ten months before taking on the title as poet laureate, New
Jersey Governor James E. McGreevey wants Baraka to resign and apologize.

Obviously, McGreevey doesn't know Baraka too well. "Amiri Baraka ain't
never been your Polite Negro Poet," writes Lee Bailey on EUR, a website
covering black entertainment and culture. "So you have to wonder what the
New Jersey powers-that-be were thinking when they named him Poet Laureate
of NJ?" In fact, Baraka warned the governor something like this might
happen. "I said, 'Governor, you're going to catch a lot of hell for
this,'" Baraka told the New York Times. "He said, 'I don't care.' I said,
'If you don't care, I don't care.'"

But the Anti-Defamation League does care and is leaning on McGreevey to
get rid of Amiri Baraka. It's not so easy, however. Baraka was selected by
a committee of poets and New Jersey state law gives the group sole power
of selection. They can't oust Baraka, nor can the governor. Baraka will
remain poet laureate until July, 2004 -- that is unless the state of New
Jersey can find a way to strip him of the title.

Regardless, Shai Goldstein of the ADL said his organization will put the
pressure on the state's humanities and arts officials. The ideas expressed
in Baraka's poem, according to William Davidson, ADL chairman-elect, are
"directly linked with the anti-American xenophobia that caused such
destruction and the murder of so many Americans." In other words, Baraka
is not much better than Osama bin Laden.

The New Jersey Council on the Arts said it "regrets" what Baraka chooses
to think and write, and they don't see how he can remain poet laureate.
Baraka, said the council members in a statement, is a "remarkable poet,"
but also said his poem is "deeply hurtful and painful." One has to wonder
if the New Jersey Council on the Arts knows anything about poetry or
literature in general, which is often "hurtful" and "painful." Of course,
when the "hurt" and "pain" issues from powerful groups, such as the
Anti-Defamation League, not even poets have an excuse. They must be purged
for their unacceptable political beliefs.

Before "everything changed," the media simply ignored poets, even when
they said outrageous things, even things now considered "anti-American."
Few people take poets seriously, even in New Jersey, home of famous poets,
including Walt Whitman, William Carlos Williams, and Allen Ginsberg. Now,
instead of ignoring poets, more than a few Americans condemn them,
especially if the poets are Muslim and hold views contrary to the US
government -- and particularly if those "anti-American" views are
broadcast via the corporate media, from the reactionary Bill O'Reilly on
Fox News to the pages of the New York Times.

As for Baraka's assertion that both the US and Israeli government had
prior knowledge of the September 11 attacks, there is clear, ample, and
documented evidence they most certainly did. Consider the following:

Newsbytes reported on September 27, 2001, that employees of Odigo, an
instant messaging company in Herzliyya, Israel, received messages warning
of the attacks two hours before they occurred. Alex Diamandis, vice
president of sales and marketing for Odigo, confirmed that workers in
Israeli received the messages. The story was subsequently carried by CNN
and Ha'aretz in Israel.

On August 11, 2001, US Navy Lt. Delmart "Mike" Vreeland, held in Toronto
on U.S. fraud charges and claiming to be an officer in U.S. Naval
intelligence, gave to Canadian authorities a sealed envelope. On September
14, 2001, Canadian jailers open Vreeland's sealed envelope to find a
letter detailing attacks against the WTC and Pentagon. Source: The Toronto
Star, Oct. 23, 2001, and Toronto Superior Court Records.

On September 6-7, 2001, 4,744 put options (a speculation that stock prices
will go down) are purchased on United Air Lines stock. There are only 396
call options (speculation that the stock will go up) at the same time.
Many of the United Air Lines puts are purchased through Deutschebank/AB
Brown, a firm managed until 1998 by the current Executive Director of the
CIA, A.B. "Buzzy" Krongard. This is reported in The New York Times and The
Wall Street Journal.

In June, 2001, German intelligence, the BND, warns the CIA and Israel that
Middle Eastern terrorists are "planning to hijack commercial aircraft to
use as weapons to attack important symbols of American and Israeli
culture." The story was reported by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,
September 14, 2001.

During the summer of 2001, Jordanian intelligence intercepts a
communication indicating attacks are planned on the WTC. The message is
relayed to Washington. Reported by John K. Cooley of ABC and published in
The International Herald Tribune on May 21, 2002.

Summer 2001. Russian intelligence notifies the CIA that 25 terrorist
pilots have been specifically training for missions involving hijacked
airliners. Reported by Izvestia.

On July 26, 2001, CBS News reports that John Ashcroft has stopped
flying commercial airlines due a threat assessment.

In August, 2001, Russian President Vladimir Putin orders Russian
intelligence to warn the U.S. government "in the strongest possible terms"
of imminent attacks on airports and government buildings. Source: MSNBC
interview with Putin, September 15.

Also in August, 2001, Dubya receives classified intelligence briefings at
his Crawford, Texas, ranch indicating that Osama bin Laden might be
planning to hijack commercial airliners. Reported by CBS News and CNN, May
15, 2001.

August through September, 2001. French intelligence services warn the FBI
of imminent attacks. These are ignored. Reported by AP, May 21, 2002.

In the week prior to September 11, a caller to a Cayman Islands radio talk
show gave several warnings of an imminent attack on the U.S. by bin Laden.
Reported by MSNBC on September 16.

On May 31, 2002, FBI Agent Robert Wright holds a press conference at the
National Press Club describing his lawsuit against the FBI for
deliberately curtailing investigations that might have prevented the 9/11
attacks. He uses words like "prevented," "thwarted," "obstructed,"
"threatened," "intimidated," and "retaliation" to describe the actions of
his superiors in blocking his attempts to shut off money flows to Al Qaeda
and other terrorist groups. Source: the C-SPAN website.

(The above information provided by Jeff Chelton of the Law Party.)

None of this, of course, was mentioned in The New York Times article on
Baraka, nor did the reactionary O'Reilly mention it when he questioned
Baraka's motives or patriotism (and also called him a "pinhead") on
Murdoch's Fox News. The New York Times, ADL, and O'Reilly are simply
providing their state assigned service -- to engender public amnesia and
divert attention from the truth surrounding 9/11 and the role played by US
intelligence and the Dubya administration. Pay no attention to the man
behind the curtain.

Finally, the following lines of Amiri Baraka's poem should be considered
far more inflammatory and indictable by the "powers-that-be" than any
accusations of anti-Semitism put forward by the ADL:

Who make money from war
Who make dough from fear and lies
Who want the world like it is
Who want the world to be ruled by imperialism and national oppression
and terror violence, and hunger and poverty.

I have returned from a business trip to discover that a virus is rampaging
an old e-mail account of mine. If you receive any strange e-mails with an
attachment , or any e-mails from my old account seanjane@clarityconnect.com
DO NOT OPEN IT!!! IT IS A VIRUS!! This virus goes through the e-mail address
book and sends itself out in wily ways. If you have McAffee anti-virus
software, it seems to be able to disable the settings and continue to send
itself out.  I am very sorry for this and I hope that nothing like this
comes your way. The virus has the words "KLEZ" in it.

ARE GOVERNMENT JOBS
GOING FROM BAD TO VERSE?

Jeff Mahoney
The Hamilton Spectator

Like many of you out there, I am hoping to become Canada's first poet
laureate.

If you haven't heard, the job was created just before Christmas when
Parliament enacted a private member's bill, introduced by Liberal Senator
Jerry Grafstein.

The job description is open-ended. The poet can compose in any language he
or she likes. Duties can be suggested to the poet, but the poet is free to
dismiss such suggestions and choose what to do, if anything.

The poet laureate can, but will not be forced to, compose verse for special
occasions, such as a royal visit or the release of a new Jim Carrey movie.

The job comes with office space, a small stipend and secretarial support,
someone, I presume, to keep track of all the appointments and meetings and
deadlines that the poet laureate doesn't have.

Reading about this in all the papers, I got to thinking: Here's a job I
could get used to. (If it seems a little cushy, remember it was proposed by
the Senate where the motto is "Must nap.")

Having very little experience at writing poetry, I figured I'd best
familiarize myself with some tricks of the trade and knock off a quick body
of verse.

Write a few odes and sonnets, a smattering of cantos, a limerick just
because I like the word Nantucket, an elegy or two, and maybe something for
a specific occasion, though I don't have to.

That's just the kind of self-starter poet laureate I am willing to be.

I hired a poetry coach, Sandburg Miasma, who, being used to poets' wages,
agreed to work for tins of tuna.

Sandburg ran me through several exercises. First, I had to think up good
comparisons that would really nail down an idea for the reader or listener.

"OK," said Sandburg, "now give me a comparison that would express surprise
and terror at the same time."

"Ooh, I've got it," came my reply. "Like a deer caught in the headlights."

Sandburg shook his head. "So cliché. Be the moth that flies 'away' from the
flame. Try again."

I thought, then said, "Instead of like a deer caught in the headlights, how
about like Mel Lastman caught in a handshake with the Hells Angels?"

"Hmm, we're getting somewhere," said Sandburg, throwing his scarf over his
shoulder and casually flicking through the channels on my TV. "You know, I
haven't watched TV in 15 years," he said. "Visual culture is such a
cesspool."

"Sandburg," I said, "I can't find a good simile to describe autumn leaves."

Barely pausing, he shot out, "Autumn leaves, falling like subscription
cards from magazines in a row of browsers."

Then he flicked through more channels and grimaced in disgust.

Wow, I thought, I'm getting my tuna's worth. I asked Sandburg about modern
poetry.

Why is it so obscure, to the point where the average person would rather
read tax return tables?

"Stay is what you say to a dog," Sandburg answered cryptically. "Beware the
librarians of the night and the wrath of the pumpkin pie. Don't you think
the joker laughs at you?"

"See, that's what I mean," I said. "I have no idea what you're talking
about."

Throwing his Doc Marten boot at the image of Dick Clark that suddenly
formed on the TV screen, he said, "Chuggachuggachugga ... Woo, woo."

And I said, "There you go again, What's that?"

"Oh, just my train of thought."

To help me understand, Sandburg walked me through some of the great
examples of modern poetry. The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock is one of
the best and clearest, but even it threw up a speed bump by the third line.

It starts, "Let us go then, you and I/ When the evening is spread out
against the sky."

That's promising, I thought. Two people. It's growing dark. Maybe they'll
get it on.

But then it goes, "Like a patient etherised upon a table."

"Am I missing something?" I asked. "I have tried very hard, Sandburg, but
no matter how I look at the evening sky, it never looks to me like a
patient etherised upon a table.

"I mean, where are the monitors, the IV tube?

"Although, come to think of it, once I saw a cloud formation that reminded
me of my mother-in-law chasing me with a rolling pin."

Sandburg stood up, slapped me in the face and called me a Philistine. When
he threatened to leave, I begged him to stay.

"Stay is what you say to dogs," he retorted, throwing his scarf over his
shoulder again.

"Look, I'll pay you more. I'll get you the white tuna or salmon if you
want. Catch of the day, you name it."

He softened a bit.

"Throw in satellite service and you've got yourself a deal. I must make a
study of how bad television has become since I last watched."

We got back to work. While I "invoked the muse," so to speak, Sandburg
watched TV. My first effort was the rather clunky Ode to a Fuel Pump. I
read it to Sandburg.

"Your bushings and your rivet heads now succumb to rust/ Your pressure's
weak, the flow a trickle/ Yet, old pump, I love you still/ Like a patient
etherised upon a table. Hey, nonny nonny."

Without taking his eyes off The People's Choice Awards, Sandburg punched me
in the mouth. "I can't believe it," he snarled. "That poem is even worse
than this show."

I wrote and wrote, determined to produce "poet laureate" quality verse.

"The boy stood on the burning deck/ His fleece was white as snow/ And
wherever Mary went ... "

Nah. Just a little derivative. I tore it up.

"This is very frustrating," I said.

"Yes," said Sandburg, "like a one-armed man trying to show the size of the
fish he caught. Try tapping into your feminine side."

And so I came up with: "Oh, poetry, thou doth pain me as the giving of
birth,/ As the passing of a bill through Parliament or a bowling ball
through a small space./ And the episiotomy stitches after,/ Whew, it's more
than I can take."

Sandburg punched me again. "That almost rhymed. Rhyme is a cancer on
poetry."

Now he was watching SpeedVision.

"Try using exotic terms from nature, like cochineal, shadblow and furze,"
Sandburg recommended. "Wax your words. Clothe your ideas in them."

Now I punched him.

I decided finally to turn my hand to love poetry.

     "She played bass in an all-girl band,
     And stood out in my life
     Like a light-coloured cat
     Shedding on a dark blue suit.
     But the pestle of her indifference
     Crushed the carnal rose. And now,
     Oh, by my ruptured vena cava,
     How I bleed! How I bleed!"

I don't care what Sandburg thinks. I'm sending this one in to Ottawa.

Anyway, he's so far gone. He's laughing at re-runs of Alf and Full House
and says things like "That Bob Saget, he rocks my world."

This poetry stuff's harder than I thought. I'm going to have a lie-down,
like a patient etherised upon a table.


Epilogue

I actually did put in a call to the Parliamentary Librarian's office where
all applications and submissions for the poet laureate position are
directed.

And Pierrette Landry told me that so far they have received fewer than five
applications.

"They are mostly older generation, seasoned writers," said Landry, project
manager for the Library of Parliament.

All applications are welcome, she added, and should be addressed to Richard
Paré, Parliamentary Librarian, in Ottawa.

She expects a poet laureate will be chosen within the next three or four
months.

What a delight to discover that kari lived in St. Louis for a time--  She
received her M.F.A. in Sculpture at Washington University, and even had a
studio in Soulard (http://stlouis.missouri.org/soulard/), one of my
favorite parts of the vieux-riverfront. She was happy to hear that the
Central West End is bustling and beautiful.  kari and I share a love of
teaching, although neither of us are in the classroom this year (kari,
here's where you can read about that elementary school workshop I was
telling you about: http://www.belz.net/teaching/journal.html).

kari speaks in wonderful low tones. Resonant.  If you spoke to her, you'd
probably associate her voice with dependability.  She has a book
forthcoming soon via Subpress, a publishing model she and I both appreciate
because of its sense of community and lack of monolithicism. (I mentioned
Zoo Press as an example of the latter; some joints try a little hard to
establish credibility, don't you think?)  I associate kari's voice with her
choice of press: personal integrity.

In fact, if you want to hear kari's resonance for yourself, she's reading
at Wordsworth's (Boston) and St. Marks (NYC) in mid-November.  As for me,
I've already heard!

Renowned scholar and author Norman O. Brown dies at age 89
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Norman O. Brown, professor emeritus of humanities at the
University of California, Santa Cruz, and author of Life Against Death
and
Love's Body, died October 2 at his residence in Santa Cruz, California.
He
was 89.

Brown's influential scholarship and teaching encompassed the classics,
theology, history, psychology, sociology, and literature, among other
disciplines. "He was a liberating, visionary scholar, the successor in
the
20th century to Blake and to Nietzsche," said Jerome Neu, professor of
philosophy at UC Santa Cruz and a longtime colleague of Brown.

When Brown's prize-winning book Life Against Death: The Psychoanalytical
Meaning of History (1959) was published, Lionel Trilling called it "the
best
interpretation of Freud that I know." It was internationally acclaimed,
ranking on the London Observer's list of best nonfiction books.

"Until I wrote Life Against Death, I was a perfect sleeper," Brown said
in a
1970 interview. "But when I learned to interpret my dreams, the power of
sleep was taken from me. Freud said he came to disturb the sleep of the
world. In my case, he succeeded."

Life Against Death disturbed Brown in another way as well. It attracted
a
wide following among the 1960s activist generation of American students,
creating unwelcome notoriety for a man who considered himself not a
radical
or a revolutionary, but rather a scholar and teacher. An attempt at a
psychoanalysis of history, Life Against Death brought Brown fame in a
variety of contexts, including the European intellectual community and
the
American counterculture. In 1966, Time magazine ranked Life Against
Death
"as one of the underground books that undergraduates feel they must
read to
be with it."

It was this kind of celebrity that Brown shied away from, and in
describing
his next book, Love's Body (1966), Brown said, "I did feel.some kind of
obligation to undo what I had done in Life Against Death. I wanted to
release any followers I had acquired.I don't want to be a leader."

Known to friends, colleagues, and students as "Nobby," Brown was born in
Mexico and educated in Europe; he trained in classics at Oxford
University.
"I wanted to go straight to the heart of the dynamo," was how Brown
explained his decision to do graduate studies in America. After getting
a
Ph.D. in classics at the University of Wisconsin, he began teaching at
Nebraska Wesleyan University.

His academic career was interrupted by World War II, during which Brown
worked as a research analyst for the Office of Strategic Services. He
returned to teaching after the war, chairing the Classics Department at
Wesleyan University in Connecticut and then moving to the University of
Rochester, where he was a professor of classics and comparative
literature.
He also published his first book, Hermes the Thief (1947), a
sociological
interpretation of mythology, greatly influenced by Marx.

Brown joined the faculty at UCSC in 1968 as a fellow of Cowell College
and
was appointed a Professor of Humanities, the only UCSC faculty member
ever
given that title. "I believe Norman O. Brown was the most distinguished
faculty member in the history of UCSC. Certainly he was a model of what
a
teacher, a colleague, and an engaged intellectual should be," said Neu.

Brown taught a variety of courses, mostly through the History of
Consciousness Department, until his retirement in 1981. His last two
books
were Closing Time (1973), and Apocalypse and/or Metamorphosis (1991), a
collection of essays he had written over the course of 30 years.

Brown was known for his erudite and imaginative lecture style, which was
often poetic. Speaking at a UCSC commencement in 1984, he told the new
graduates: "It is not a matter of having a soul, or of saving it, but
more
actively a matter of soul-making. The soul is creative and must create
itself: it is the creative imagination."

Brown is survived by his wife of 64 years, Elizabeth P. Brown; his sons
Stephen and Thomas; daughters Rebecca and Susan; grandsons Alex Brown
and
Jeremy Gussin; and granddaughters Lisa Brown, Meika Scott-Brown, and
Sara
Gussin.

A celebration of the life of Norman O. Brown will take place on
Saturday,
October 19, at 3 p.m. in a location to be determined.

The ADL Smear Campaign Against Me
I Will Not Resign, I Will Not Apologize
by AMIRI BARAKA

The recent dishonest, consciously distorted and insulting
non-interpretation of my poem, "Somebody Blew Up America" by the
"Anti-Defamation" League, is fundamentally an attempt to defame me. And
with that, an attempt to repress and stigmatize independent thinkers
everywhere.

This trashy propaganda is characteristic of right-wing zealots who are
interested only in slander and character assassination of those whose
views or philosophies differ from or are in contradiction to theirs.

First, the poem underlying theme focuses on how Black Americans have
suffered from domestic terrorism since being kidnapped into US chattel
slavery, e.g., by Slave Owners, US & State Laws, Klan, Skin Heads,
Domestic Nazis, Lynching, denial of rights, national oppression, racism,
character assassination, historically, and at this very minute throughout
the US. The relevance of this to Bush call for a "War on Terrorism", is
that Black people feel we have always been victims of terror, governmental
and general, so we cannot get as frenzied and hysterical as the people who
while asking us to dismiss our history and contemporary reality to join
them, in the name of a shallow "patriotism" in attacking the majority of
people in the world, especially people of color and in the third world.

This is said to us, even as this counterfeit president has legalized the
Confederate Flag in Mississippi. Could the victims of European Fascism be
as frantically loyal to a regime that would fly a Nazi Swastika over their
homes? So we cannot, in good conscience, celebrate what seems to us an
international crusade to set up a military dictatorship over the world,
legitimatized at base, by white supremacy, carried out, no matter the
crude lies, as the most terrifying form of Imperialism and its attendant
national oppression. All of it designed to drain super profits bluntly
from the colored peoples of the world, but as well, from the majority of
the peoples in the world. For all the frantic condemnations of Terror by
Bush &c, as the single International Super Power, they are the most
dangerous terrorists in the world!

Actually, in my focus on various forces of terror Afro Americans and other
oppressed people of the world have suffered, slavery, colonialism,
Imperialism, Neo neo-colonialism, National Oppression, the ADL
disingenuously makes no mention of my probing into the creators of the
holocaust, e.g., "who put the Jews in ovens, / and who helped them do it,
/ Who said "America First"/ and Ok'd the yellow stars", which of course is
a reference to America's domestic fascists just before World War @ and the
Nazi Holocaust.

Nor do these ADL purveyors of falsehood mention the poem's listing of some
of the Jews across the world, oppressed, imprisoned, murdered by actual
Anti- Semitic forces, open or disguised. The poem asks "Who killed Rosa
Luxembourg, Liebnecht/Who murdered the Rosenbergs/ And all the good people
iced, tortured, assassinate, vanished".

The ADL apparently is not outraged by McCarthy era frame-up and execution
of the Rosenbergs, nor the assassination of German Jewish Communist
leaders like Liebnecht, Luxembourg. The ADL leaves these things out to try
to make their lies more believable, and also because these victims of
imperialism were on the Left

Happily the Star Ledger published the entire poem, though including in a
box, supposedly identifying the offending phrases, my question, "Who Blew
Up The Reichstag?" as if the ADL had also claimed that the poem was
inferring that Jews did it. When it was Hitler's destruction of the
Reichstag, that provided the pretext for the general imprisonment of Jews,
after incarcerating Communists, Social Democrats and Trade Unionists. Why
this was done one can only speculate, but this is the kind of sloppy or
intentionally slanderous journalism one can often find in the media. It
also reflects the kind of unprincipled attack that characterizes ADL press
release.

The Reichstag fire, parallels the 911 Attack, in that after that
"mysterious act of terrorism", which Hitler blamed on Jews and Communists,
the Nazis passed a law The Reichstag Enablement Act, that gave the Nazis
much the same carte blanche as the Bush administration used the 911
tragedy to pass the wholly undemocratic Patriot Bill and begin rounding up
suspects, even without identifying them. Of course the actual arsonists of
the Reichstag terror were never found, though most scholars are certain it
was the Nazis themselves.

Of the other lines of the poem, which the ADL termed an example of the
Hitlerian "Big Lie", and the poet's "spewing Anti-Semitic venom". The
lines, "Who knew the World Trade Center was gonna get/bombed?" Well now,
certainly, even the Democratic Party has affirmed that the Bush
Administration knew. I agree with this, and it is everywhere on the
Internet that not only was the US warned repeatedly by Germany, France,
Russia, England but also Israel. Michael Ruppert of the Green Party has
issued a video stating clearly, "Israeli security issued urgent warnings
to the CIA of large-scale terror attacks. ...And that the Israeli Mossad
knew that the attacks were going to take place...they knew that the World
Trade Center were the targets. This is from British newspaper the
"Telegraph". (Copies of these documents available with this statement.)

In addition there are articles in all forms of media and of course the
Internet confirming or suggesting that the entire Imperialist world knew
and had warned the US CIA in advance, but no action was taken. WHY. They
say they "couldn't connect the dots". The FBI agents in Minnesota and
Arizona who sd that FBI received a report in 1998 that a terrorist
organization ...planned to bring people to the US to enroll in flight
schools. Zacharias Moussoui, now charged with conspiring in the Sept 11
attacks, was arrested by the Minnesota agents of the FBI in August 2001
but FBI HQ denied agents request to seek a warrant even to search his
computer. And in a prepared statement by a Minnesota FBI agent, he blamed
legal restrictions but principally FBI headquarters for impeding a more
aggressive investigation of this man. As for the other agent's attempt to
warn the FBI HQ of these attacks, he was rebuffed when he made the report,
but now FBI HQ says it has not record of such warning. (See
<Truthout.org/docs>)

There are other incredible dots on the media, for instance the
stockholders of American Airlines and United, which were the carriers
highjacked to commit the terror began withdrawing stock from these
companies in August before the attacks.

The most offensive phrase in the poem to my various attackers is, "Who
told 4000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers / to stay home that day/ Why
did Sharon stay away?" To infer that I am accusing Israel of committing
the atrocity is disingenuous slander and character assassination. But I do
believe, as I stated about England, Germany, France, Russia, that the
Israeli government, certainly it's security force, SHABAK knew about the
attack in advance.

My sources were, "Ha'aretz" and "Yadiot Ahranot" (two Israeli newspapers)
"Al Watan" (a Jordanian newspaper), "Manar" -TV and the website of the
Israeli security force SHABAK. There are myriad references to this in
Reuters, Der Spiegel.

The Israeli newspaper Yadiot Ahranot lst revealed that SHABAK had canceled
Sharon's appearance in New York City that day, Sept 11, where he was
supposed to speak at an "Israel Day" celebration. This was also mentioned
in the Star Ledger, to the effect that Sharon was supposed to visit the
US, but no dates were mentioned.

It is the Green Party's Ruppert who makes the most effective case for the
4000 Israeli workers (Not Jewish Workers!) but Israeli nationals. He says
in his video, "if what I am showing you is know overtly although the
media, how much more does our thirty billion dollar intelligence community
know"/

He goes on, and this seems true to me, It is "Nonsense" to say the
Israelis did it They were warning the U.S. hand over fist..." Ruppert
speculates further 1. The US did not listen 2. They needed the attacks"
which I leave to time, as Malcolm X sd, Time will tell.

But the most stunning revelation is this, again Ruppert, "We reviewed the
list of former tenants of the World Trade Center at the on-line Wall St
Journal site. And there's the website. It is an alphabetical list of
tenants. Scroll to the very bottom and notice the moving date for the
office of Zim American-Israeli Shipping to Norfolk Virginia. They were in
the World Trade Center. They must have had Mossad" (or Shabak- AB) input
because they vacated one week before September and they broke their lease.
The Israelis didn't pull the attack, but they were smart enough to get
their people out of the way. How come our government didn't do the same
thing for us." (Statement & Quote by George DeCarlo, Coordinator of Union
County Greens, Co Founder of the NJ Lavender Greens- included in media
pkg.)

The poem was never saying anything else, i.e., why didn't the other
slaughtered Americans know? I WAS NOT SAYING ISRAEL WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE ATTACK, BUT THAT THEY KNEW AND OUR OWN COUNTERFEIT PRESIDENT DID TOO!

There is other disturbing facts surround the hideous 911 attacks, which my
family and I could see from the third floor bathroom window of our homes!
And certainly one day all this will be thoroughly investigated. The poem
says "Who know why Five Israelis was filming the explosion/ And cracking
they sides at the notion." I got this story from The Star Ledger, where it
appeared twice, and The New York Times.

The reference to "cracking they sides" or laughing uproariously while
filming the 911 attack, apparently on the top of a truck from the Jersey
side is a direct paraphrase of the Ledger articles. In fact, the State
Police, who arrested them, stated that that is one of the reasons they did
arrest them, because they were laughing.

Again, these were Israeli Nationals, persons holding Israeli passports.
The Times article even reported on what their lives were like in Jail. And
implied they would be deported. So this reference is not more of the ADL's
"Anti-Semitic venom" but arrived at merely from studying the US media.

Why those five Israelis were there filming and laughing I do not claim
know. That's why the poem here and throughout continuously chants the
question WHO WHO WHO? That is, who is responsible for this horrible crime
and WHY? It is a poem that aims to probe and disturb, but there is not the
slightest evidence of Anti-Semitism, as anyone who reads it without some
insidious bias would have to agree.

Why the ADL would do this, I can only speculate.

I wish they and other concerned pundits would speculate on how an Airplane
flying in America, where the pilot has to file a flight plan before taking
off, how can such a plane or two or three of them file such a route in
which they would travel, and in the case of the planes leaving Boston make
45 degree turns south and fly 54 minutes to the World Trade Center and 90
minutes to the Pentagon and not be challenged by US Air Defense Fighters,
or brought down by ground to air missiles?

Having been in the Air Force I know those ADC fighters would normally
confront such "rogue" aircraft within a few minutes! Why was this not
done? Let the ADL and the media investigating me, investigate that!

We should know that Bush and his Right Wing crew want War against all the
forces of their so called "Axis of Evil" What a not so wild coincidence
that the path of this Axis parallels the route of the proposed US oil
corporations- pipe line from Saudi to the far east, apparently to oppose
the spiraling economic growth and influence of China. They scream "Bin
Laden" and "Taliban" and destroy Afghanistan, install a puppet president
and a shadow occupation force.

Next in the Axis is Iraq, we should have known that. With no real proof at
all again the people of the US outraged and frightened by the Reichstag of
911 are hyped with chants of "Regime Change" and "Saddam Hussein". No
longer is the madness of crowds being aroused by the "Anti -Terrorist"
campaign and Bin Laden as the Devil figure used to rouse the people to a
patriotic frenzy, now it is Saddam Hussein. So forget last month's war and
get ready for this month's.

Bush says he wants "regime change" in Palestine, he wants to oust Arafat,
now in Iraq, and he wants to oust Saddam. The Axis projects Iran next and
then North Korea. What is this an updated version of 1984 or an American
version of Hitler's and Bush 1's) New World Order?

Regime Change, why? Because these regimes are anti democratic or
terrorists or in the case of Saddam, they have "weapons of mass
destruction".

Well if being anti democratic were a good rationalization for foreign
invasions of countries then the United States better watch out because the
Florida coup, which tricked the American people into accepting Bush as
President is anything but democratic. Should we let foreign countries
invade us to get rid of Bush? What would be the American People's reaction
to such Third Reich replay?

And as for Saddam having "weapons of mass destruction" (or mass diversion
as some critics say) The US has these weapons. So do Israel, South Africa,
Germany, France, Italy, England, Russia, and now China, India, Pakistan.
How is it the US and its allies (except the Chinese) can have such
weapons, but no one else can. The answer to that, of course, is White
Supremacy and Imperialism. And what should be the growing understanding by
the American people and the democratic people of the world, is what the
far right Bush coven wants is a military dictatorship of the world.

The ADL, by attacking me by distorting what my poem is saying, is doing
its usual ugly, as a well known running dog of imperialism, particularly
by attacking anyone who takes an independent position or is critical of
Israeli Imperialism and its attendant ideology political Zionism. As they
are attempting with me the ADL slanders anyone who is not happy with
Israel's ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians

As Anti Semitic, when lst of all Israel and its guiding philosophy have
nothing to do, as categories, with Jews. (See "Zionism in the Age of the
Dictators", Brenner

But this is the trick such demagogues as the ADL use to hide the crimes of
Imperialist Israel. When we criticize US imperialism does that make us
enemies of Christianity, maybe only to Jerry Falwell and such Right wing
Christian Zealots, perhaps Asscraft But neither Israel nor Zionism is the
same as Judaism. (Op cit Brenner; also "The Dilemma of the Modern Jew,
Prinz".) But this is the trick the Israeli's and their sympathizers use to
hide behind Judaism. Israel (and it's political Zionism) has as much to do
with Judaism, as the US has to do with Christianity.

In the US our constitution makes clear that this is a secular nation and
by law theoretically enforces separation of church and state, tho Mr. Bush
and Mr. Asscraft have demonstrated they disagree, and Israel outright says
it is a "Jewish State" but if that is so then that explains why it can
discriminate against its Arab people living inside Israel and make them
2nd class citizens, in much the same way that South Africa, a close friend
did under Apartheid. (See "The Crisis of Black Jewish Relations", Brenner
& Bloom; "Israel and South Africa", Stevens & Ellmessi; The "Arabs in
Israel" by Sabri Jiryis, foreword by Noam Chomsky)

The ADL attacks so it can confuse people and show me as just another Anti-
Semitic attacker of their absolutely false depictions of Israel as a
victim of Palestinian Terrorism. This is absolutely in tune with the Bush
administrations

Frenzied "destroy Iraq regime change "Jones" (a street word for narcotics
addiction) that the administration is chanting around us like cheer
leaders at a football game! So that US imperialism can transform the whole
of the Middle East, the Arab world into a gas station (See "Bushwacked: A
Counterfeit President for a Fake Democracy", Baraka)

So that we are supposed to believe that if a little girl blows herself up
in a Israeli Pizza Parlor, she is a terrorist, but when Israeli Jets, made
in the USA, destroy whole sections of Palestinian cities, bulldoze
neighborhoods, all but destroy the Palestinian Center of Governance, with
its President, Yasser Arafat, inside sitting in the dark, it is the
Israelis who are victims and the little Palestinian girl or boy or young
man or young woman or even elder, they are the terrorists. We are supposed
to be intimidated by demagogues like the Anti Defamation League (who shd
be called the Anti Anti Defamation League) so that Israel as a jr. partner
of the Bush led US goosestep to world military domination can commit
ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians in the name of fighting terrorism.

It is the ADL, which is actually guilty of what its leader, Abraham Foxman
calls the Hitlerian "Big Lie", and ironically it is the ADL, which is
"spewing anti-Semitic venom". The same ADL which became aware of "Black
Anti Semitism", which it had earlier said has never been a threat, until
Stokely Carmichael and SNCC began to support the PLO and the Palestinian
Struggle as a Liberation Struggle and condemn Israeli Imperialism and
Zionism. That is when, as Stokeley Carmichael says in the APRP's "Smash
Zionism" the ADL smashed SNCC instead.

As Israel drew closer to South Africa, politically, economically,
militarily in the 60's (Op Cit, above & others) the Black Liberation
Movement and African Nations became more and more guilty, according to the
ADL, of "Black Anti-Semitism".

This is the same ADL who opposed Affirmative Action, even though many Jews
benefited by the Civil Rights Struggle, and the most notable white
comrades in that struggle were young Jews. The same ADL that filed an
Amicus Curiae (friend of the court brief) in the historic and reactionary
Baake Decision which challenged & defeated the University of California's
affirmative action as "racist" and was explained by the ADL as its
opposition to quotas. So that the university's could now enforce a quota
on Black students of none!

This is the same ADL, which in league with the American Israel Political
Action Committee, just a few weeks ago sent millions of dollars into
Atlanta, Georgia to defeat progressive Black Congress woman Cynthia
McKinney, because she called for a more balance American view of the
Palestinian -Israeli Conflict.

These same forces defeated in Alabama, another progressive Black incumbent
Congressman, because he too dared to support the Palestinians. (See New
York Times), Amsterdam News, Star Ledger).

Very much like the way Bush touts "Regime Change," recently even hinting
at an attempted Assassination of Saddam Hussein, if the American People
rise up and force our congress to deny the Bush juggernaut of terror to
attack Iraq. ADL and their " bagman" AIPAC didn't like these black
politicians stance on Israel, so in a minute and a few million dollars,
they are gone!

So now, it's my turn. Using my poem, Somebody Blew Up America" they are

Going to spread the Big Lie, distort what poem says. Cover the fact that
this poem actually is an attack on Imperialism, National Oppression,
Monopoly Capitalism, Racism, Anti-Semitism. I challenge ADL to show
anywhere in this poem that is Anti-Semitic in the least. In their press
release they say talk about "Jews being scapegoated throughout history...'
then "conspiracy mongers of the Arab world...have taken Anti-Israel
propaganda to a new level " (Mr. Foxman, what is the Arab World? Alan
Dershowitz in his "Chutzpah" says the basis of bigotry is
"overgeneralization," so where is the "Arab World"? Is Detroit included?
Asscraft thinks so.

Earlier the press release mentions "the Muslim World" does that include
Lyons Ave, Newark? But then from "Anti-Semitism" the release goes to
Israel, not Jews, and Israeli Mossad as those victimized. So they fight
Anti Semitism

Mainly by "defending" Israel. In fact they defend Israel like Joe McCarthy
"defended" the US against Communism. Included in my package is a
communique from an Israeli Peace Organization ": Gush Shalom", "Israeli
Peace Block (see Defamation from the Anti Defamation League Answered"
(<info@gush-shalom.org>) This was first published 7/11/2000 as a press
release. "In the past 24 hours, an attack is being mounted against Gush
Shalom. Knesset Member Collette Avital (Labor) has actually lodge a
complaint with the police, claiming that cartoons presented on our website
constitute "incitement". And the powerful American Jewish organization
Anti -Defamation League found time, even on election day, over there, to
disseminate a message of defamation against "Gush Shalom", which already
resulted in hate e mails being sent our address"

In a following message signed by Adam Keller Gush, Shalom Spokesperson.
The organization defends itself from an ADL pres release s "expressing
outrage at Gush Shalom's portrayal of Prime Minster Barak as a killer of
Palestinian children in a caricature on its web site, stating that the
image of Barak standing on the bleeding bullet ridden body of a
Palestinian child is abhorrent."

Gush Shalom replies, "Still after consulting with my fellow activists I am
in a position to make an offer. Should a complete week - seven days pass
in which not a single unarmed Palestinian is killed by the Israeli armed
forces which are answerable to Mr. Barak, we would remove the above
mentioned cartoon from our website.

The Gush Shalom statement ends "As for the ADL- an organization which
claims to "counter hatred prejudice and bigotry" can you truly find no
other places to search for such, with Israeli society in its present
condition, except at our modest website. Was the ADL attacking these
Israelis for being Anti Semitic or criticizing rather forcefully the
continuous murder of the Palestinians. So in Israel itself, ADL is still
covering for and attacking anyone, even Israeli citizens themselves who
oppose the Bush Zionist Plan to de-Palestinianize Palestine!

Another communication from Israel (<robertoj69@yahoo.com>). This signed by
95 Israeli Academics (copy included in pkg), Sept 23, 2002 that begins
"URGENT WARNING: THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT MAY BE CONTEMPLATING CRIMES
AGAINST HUMANITY" It goes on, "We members of the Israeli academe are
horrified by US buildup of aggression towards Iraq and by the Israeli
political leadership's enthusiastic support of it. We are deeply worried
by indications that the "fog of war" could be exploited by the Israeli
government to commit further crimes against the Palestinian people, up to
full-fledged ethnic cleansing."

One striking description of the Israeli Military by these professors is
that in an interview found in Ha'aretz Sept 19, 2002, Israeli Chief of
Staff Moshe Ya'alon describe the Palestinians as a "cancerous
manifestation" and equated the military actions in the Occupied
territories with "chemotherapy"

Certainly the ADL will have to go after these "Anti Semites" using the
"Big Lie" and "Spewing Anti-Semitic Venom"! And the growing list of
progressive democratic people around the world who will have opinions
about Israel and Political Zionism independent of the ADL, the ADL will
have to attack and slander them as well

I challenge the ADL to set up a national television program so that we
might debate this issue. We can project the poem on a wall and go down
line by new and discuss it. If not that then why not a forum or debate
some place like NYC Town Hall or at Symphony Hall in Newark.

Why not take a survey of those who heard the poem at the Dodge Festival?
Those who registered and the students brought by schools could be
contacted and a survey taken to reflect just the majority of people
hearing the poem thought, not just some shadowy surrogates of Imperialism
who are trying to convince people that I and my poem are the enemy not US
and Israeli Imperialism.

I have already gotten a great many communications praising the poem. A
great many E-mail letters and phone calls not only praising the poem, and
the poet for writing it, but also opposing the attempt to violate my first
amendment rights by this oft repeated ADL skin game of calling critics of
imperialism Anti Semites.

I have already said, in answer to what Governor McGreevey is quoted as
demanding that I apologize and that I resign as NJ Poet Laureate. And I
have said repeatedly that I will do neither. It is unfortunate that
Governor McGreevey has been stampeded by paid liars, and apologists for
ethnic cleansing and white supremacy, bourgeois nationalists and the
dangerously ignorant, to be panicked into joining in the ADL's slander,
belittling my intelligence, and insulting not only my person, my family,
my fellow artists and activists who know all this is just the feces of a
very small cow. But they are also attacking my work in the arts and my
social political views. By demanding that I apologize to Evil and Submit
to some fundamentally racist and politically motivated call for me to
resign as New Jersey's Poet Laureate, he is insulting the broad group of
people who know he is incorrect and who have read and celebrated and
valued my work. And that is a grave mistake, one I am hoping he will
correct.

"Somebody Blew Up America!" was written Oct 1, 2001. A month after the
terror attack. Almost immediately I circulated it around the world on the
Internet.

In addition, I have read this poem in Spain, Portugal, Africa,
Switzerland, Italy, Finland and it was translated into German and read on
German radio, at Universities and other venues across this country. It has
become one of the most circulated of my poems.

Yet it was not until I read the poem at the Dodge Poetry Festival that I
got negative response from three people that I know of. The overwhelming
response was an almost thunderous applause. I even had to come out and
take a second bow at one performance. So why now and Who, as the poem
asks, is behind it? Perhaps the forces which have dishonestly tried to
characterize the poem as "venom" or merely "a harangue" (just as they
called John Coltrane's music "Barbaric Yawps") are simply, the Charlie
McCarthy voices for Bush & Sharon's Edgar Bergen's. Empty-headed devilish
dummies constructed of wood and painted and costumed to look like it is
real people speaking, when all the time it is imperialism is the
ventriloquist speaking through their mouths,

NO, I WILL NOT APOLOGIZE, I WILL NOT RESIGN. In fact I will continue to do
what I have appointed to do but still have not been paid to do. Publicize
and Popularize poetry and poets throughout this state. To set up new
venues and new networks for poetry reading and workshops, in the state's
libraries and schools and other institutions. Hopefully initiated and
given paradigm right here in the Newark Public Library, its branches and
throughout the school system. Therefore giving more of our citizens access
to poetry, involving poets of all nationalities, both male and female, of
diverse experience and styles. I have already begun to enlist coordinators
of poetry programs throughout the state, so that we can network a tour of
poets, hopefully beginning in January, throughout the state.

To do this I will be approaching local, county, state, federal and private
funding. And expand our budget with the cooperation of these other
existing programs. We will ask that poets POET-ON! That they begin to
produce at least one poem or publish a poem monthly, in the most modest
forms, Kinko style, and give them away if they have to. That they begin to
set up readings not only in the places we mentioned but also in parks and
restaurants and in neighborhoods.

We say this because we feel that this state and indeed this nation and
this world is desperately in need of the deepest and most profound human
values that poetry can teach. That is what Keats and Du Bois called for
the poet to do, to bring Truth and Beauty. To be like the most ancient
paradigmythic image of the poet. To be like Osiris and Orpheus, whose job
it was to raise the Sun each morning with song and story. To illuminate
the human mind, and bring light into the world. POET ON!

Subject:      I just spoke with Murat Nemet-Nejat on the phone
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

How deliciously mundane--as a poodle or moodring--the fact that Murat works
a mere 10 blocks from me in New York's bustling midtown. (Why, I have even
"run into" him on the street!) I have no idea where he went to
school--although he's told me repeatedly. Murat and I share a love of hard
alcohol and eggplant (although he's not quite the Baba Ganoush fiend I am),
and though we do plan to meet for dinner tonight before Kevin and Dodie's
reading at the Project, it's doubtful we'll wind up anywhere that serves
really outstanding zaalouk <http://www.concentric.net/~Tomnap/zaalouk.html>,
let alone raki <http://www.raki.com>.

Murat speaks in fabulously glowing "crop circles" of verbs, prepositions,
nouns ... and more nouns! If you spoke with him, you would perhaps not think
of "crop circles"--except, oh! I have "planted" them in your mind! How could
you not, now! He has a number of books forthcoming soon--including a
long-awaited tome from Talisman of translations from contemporary Turkish
poetry and an equally long-awaited essay on photography from Green Integer.
Murat--whose each name ends with a "T"--chose these presses because *they*
include the letter "T" in them as well! Is he out of his mind? We are
meeting outside St. Mark's Bookstore--conveniently situated at the "T" of
9th Street and Third Avenue. I associate Murat's voice with Turkey, not
simply because he was born there, but because, it too features the letter
"T"--so prominently!

Oh, if only you could hear Murat, his "T"s flying off his tongue--such sweet
tintinnabulation, and never tatterdemalian! Oh, if only, if only he were not
such a Tease!

Hi, Kevin and list.

There's more info on the Short Fuse launch, at which I'm also reading, at the
Ratapallax website:
http://www.rattapallax.com/fusion_week.htm

Also, a PDF version of the press release is at
http://www.rattapallax.com/fusion_images/fuse_week_release.pdf

 Also, I want to draw everyone's attention to a related reading on the 17th
of October at the Galapagos Art Space (70 North 6th St., Williamsburg,
Brooklyn, NY). This is going to be a showcase of some Conundrum Press writers
and performers from Montreal, and one former Montrealer in New York (me), who
make up a large part of the Canadian contingent in the "global" Short Fuse
anthology. These are people (Catherine Kidd, Ian Ferrier...) who do their
work in the zone between poetry/fiction and theatre, without being anything
like slam poets. There is a lot going on that week, and none of us is
well-known in New York, but I hope you will be enticed to come by the
opportunity to sample a style of performance writing which is unique, I
think, to the Montreal scene.

Kevin, I assume you're in St.John's and I won't be seeing you there, but
thanks for the interest.

Thanks Miekal . . . but this is very sad news indeed.

Nobby was an incredible human being -- wise, learned, yet always impish and
spritely. I was fortunate enough to be a student of his at UC Santa Cruz,
absolutely one of my formative experiences as a poet . . . (if such things
happen anymore, or can be categorized as such).

When students signed up for his History of Consciousness class at UC Santa
Cruz in the fall of 1973, none of them, I think, were prepared for an
intensive reading of Pound's *Cantos* (it was a two-quarter class, the
second being readings in Olson and Duncan); the final assignment for the
class was to write our own cantos. I still remember, as if it were
yesterday, one of his rambling lectures about why there were two myths of
Dionysus' birth . . . at one point he stopped talking and walked to the
window and looked out, the class completely hushed . . . and he said "Greece
is a long way from Monterey Bay" . . .

After I'd graduated, I kept in touch, and at one point wrote him a long
rambling (stoned) letter after re-reading everything he'd written, and
demanded at the end "Where are your poems?" (The last line of *Love's Body"
is "All is a metaphor, there is only poetry"). He was unbearably gracious,
writing back that "perhaps, one day" he would have some poems to show; it
was the most gentle come-uppance I think I've ever received.

His last book, *Apocaclypse and/or Metamorphosis" (mentioned in that
obituary) contains some amazing essays about Islam (which he decided to "do"
after the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979), as well as reflections about
socialist politics and poetry after the fall of the Berlin Wall (heavy on
Zukofsky). It's well-worth checking out, as are his previous books . . .

God, it hurts. He was wonderful.

 believing that tibet has always been a part of china is basicly ignoring
the
 fact that it was independant, though it did have close ties with china
developed during the 5th and 6th centuries in particular.
a million tibetans dead or missing, thousands jailed without so much as a
hearing for years--torture as the rule rather than the exception. these are
 facts. documented facts.
 as for mongolia, sorry, your'e sadly mistaken. i have a friend, living in
 canada, was a physicist. he spent two years in a chinese prison before even
 having a hearing. his crime ? he brought a newspaper into the country. one
 newspaper. yep, thats all. two years, finally freed to be exiled from his
family and country for life. he considers himself lucky to have gotten out,
 with the help of amnesty international. this is a documented case.
 thats the enlightened goverment you speak so highly of, richard.
china has no more integrity than any other country and a history of starting
guerilla wars in the countries it borders, destablizing those countries,
then coming in when the goverments collapse. if you want to see this in
 progress, check out whats happening in nepal.
 as for the statement that 'china is relatively uncorrupt' everyone i know
 from china says the goverment is corrupt.
 i would also stress that i am not comparing the united states to any
 country, waving the flag of colonializm in drag, so to speak.
 your statement :
 quote : > the present western backed ractionaries in Tibet musd be kept
 "down" aslso
  any in Mongolia:
 is very familar to me. substitute 'women' or ' niggers' in place of
tibetans
 or mongolians and we've heard it before in this country during the 60's and
 seventies. you can still hear it south of the mason dixon line.
 intolerance, bigotry, viewing people as objects rather living beings,
 ignorance, thats what blew up america, richard.
 i'll refrain from the name calling you've indulged in, honest dscourse and
 diverse viewpoints being my goal.
 be well,
beth garrison

in the interest of moving this monthly topic a little ways past the usual
level I just came across a couple of bits that might be of interest.

there is a new book out on _A Language for Psychosis (Brunner Routledge
books are generally quite interesting).

according to Duncan the activity of the poet is _psychotic. as in
'pf a psychosis," meaning, literally, "the soul in process," from the Greek
_psyche, for soul, and the suffix, -osis, for process (taken from o'Leary's
_Gnostic Contagion.

   Repeat Repeat Repeat....i don't have the sitzfleisch for 509 lines of
Baraka..and i'm alternating 'tween  the NFL and the play-offs..so let's just
stick to ONE line..."why did Sharon stay away"...

   The Baraka answer is because he knew 9/11 was coming..and his proof is that
one Israeli Newspaper is quoted as saying that Sharon cancelled an appointment
that day for an "Israeli Day Event" in N.Y.C...no date of newspaper...no
direct quote of statement...

   But let's say it's TRUE..how would that prove Sharon knew about 9/11...was
he in actual danger..was he supposed to have a bagel and lox breakfast at
W.T.C. at 8:50 that morn..or was he going to be on one of the air-liners that
were to be hijacked...he flies on his own plane...and if he didn't... wouldn't
he fly on El Al...and as a devious Jew wouldn't it have made more sense to be
in NY that day to console the Americans...

    The BIG BIG BIG LIE...repeat repeat repeat...tell it again, again, again,
and as proof offer any incidental fact...Baraka is not a fool..but he is a
hater a anti-semite and a poet with a license to kill...DRn...

 Thank you, Joe.  Before he went to UC Santa Cruz Nobby Brown was teaching
at University of Rochester,  when I got my first job there.
The English Department was OK but the History Department, which is where he
taught, as well as Psychology, was exceptional. Hayden White also moved to
Santa Cruz from that Department. I never got to know Brown as well as I
would have liked--if I had been a student my awe would have had somewhere to
go--,but lunched with him a few times, and hung out with the historians.  He
was an great inspiration to someone like me who wanted to work the
disciplinary interstices.

Gary, thank you very much for the piece you did on my work. I am glad to
hear you think this makes it meet for the Present.
  an E-mail you posted to the Buffalo List today sounds in a coiple places
like it was meant for me--but that's how one can develop "ideas of

I am sending you a copy of "As in 'T' as in 'Tether'". That is, I will, if

I think that academe discredits itself when it mistakes its role: teachers, even when they are also scholars, are the transmitters and analysts of culture, not its makers.  That is why writers and artists have traditionally had to leave academe in order to make new work.  Pound and Eliot, you recall, started out as grad students but then left in order to seek the real center of literary activity in their time -- even though that meant finding alternative means of existence, and doing so in a foreign country.  Now, though, it seems that no one ever graduates from college (to quote Ashbery).

It occurs to me that a real conservative would _encourage_ the massive schooling of artists, because that would be the best way to insure that praxis would conform to a common standard of taste, which is, sort of, what we have today.  Maybe the great academies of European painting, or the "schools" that formed around individual masters, provide a comparison to the institutional styles of poetry writing available today.

My opinion, Joe Amato, is that it's not a question of finding an _alternative_ institution for poetry.  To institute is to create statutes, norms of discourse, criteria for tenure, etc...  Leave that to the police, as Foucault I think said.  Or there's that sticker I saw on a bike the other day here in Eugene (anarchist central): "Civilization... Just walk away."  I exaggerate, but you catch my drift.

The Right's attack on the Academic-Professional Left (and vice versa) is, I think, a duel of sanctimonies.  Bill Bennett may have the ear of Dick Cheney, but there are 2000 colleges and universities in the U.S., each brimming with astonishingly like-minded faculty.  There may be, as Maria Damon asserts, bad consequences for education funding, professors' work conditions, etc.  But I think it is wrong to assume that a powerful educational apparatus is necessarily good for the making of new poetry.  Indeed, and it kills me to say this, the decadence of the university may be a good thing for poetry insofar as it pushes writers into a more independent position.

Adorno's thesis, as presented by Nick Piombino, is that criticizing what is self-evidently garbage does not make you a builder of civilization: it just makes you a garbageman -- and a barbarian, too, if you think that you deserve credit for pointing out the obvious.  The war should have been the broom that swept away both the garbage and the garbagemen: both bourgeois thought and its Fascist and Stalinist alternatives.  Instead, Adorno sees that his countrymen are building VW Beetles and buying Beatles records (or whatever).  I think his disillusionment is bracing, but the example of Milosz (who personally witnessed the carnage) shows that interesting poetry can come out of even that kind of thinking; indeed, accepting the garbage thesis may be the minimal prerequisite for good writing of any kind, today.  Yet think how we congratulate ourselves for refusing to buy the official line.  Adorno would be contemptuous of that kind of garbageman's self-flattery, wouldn't he?

Andy. You present some of the eternal "conundrums". We need the culture of
the academe: we need the "garbage" and the so-called "bad culture and the
good (the "high" and the "low" - yes, even some of the corruption - and yet
in many ways we become accomplices in that culture even as we ("innocently"?
is there any  innocence) write say a poem like ..what, say a typical Ashbery
poem ...many of which one feels JA could  keep on writing forever: now
nothing wrong with that per se. Paradoxically to critique the culture and to
be "on the outer" we have to know or have known the "inner" so many of us in
"attacking" so-called academics partake of and enhance both the high and the
low so to speak: we cant escaoppe the language and its social-political
immplicatios, we cant escape the memories of Auschwitz ...in a sense (the
good one I hope) we are all intellectuals and academics - we are Homo
Thinkins in fact. Baraka - dreaded name - but the point is he went to
university: now he might be contemptuous of "liberal studies" but I would
disagree: I think the universities and even "tenure" are essential: this
doesnt preclude failed academics such as myself dabbliing in poetry and some
incoherent poetics and pot shotting  and writing on "the oputside" (If
I/we/they am/are).  We need the academe if only to cruitque it: we even need
Harold Bloom and Helen Vendler...we may not "need" he cult of the
genius...but its hard to fiid a pure "working class" poetry.....bush poets
as I call them are invariably boring: or often are, we need academicswho
ahve left ethhalls of acadeeme sure...but we also need to support the
funding of the universities and the academy and academics themselves: but
that world of the academe needs constantly to be challenged, as I think we
see it is, this doesnt mean rejection of course: Eliot and Pound decided
against staying inside the halls of academe and maybe that's good for many
but we cant all be Ed Dorns or Jack Spicers or whoever (and are anyof us
ever really "outside" ..we can  always use a universiitylibrary, talk to
academics)...Ashbery was Havard educated ...there is no question that MOST
of the major poets have been university educated: the problem arises of the
politics intra the universities, funding, what is valorised, what
emphasised: C K Stead of NZ left the Uni of Auck but Michelle Leggott and a
quite different poet Vincent O'Sullivan are still very much in the academic
role(s) and so on.

I couldnt get to Perelman's interview online but I feel that we need poets
to be paid (albeit that _can _  lead to a certain ossification or
conseravtism: but that doesnt need to happen: it gives a certian kind of
temperament the opportunity to write without having to earn a crust (in
deadening and menial work or just tedious work ...given that certain
academic work can also be quite onerous..then the solution would be to have
writers who do none of the menial tasks of marking essays etc and have a big
fredom to write and research: and to give lectures when they wish)) as long
as we resist the tendency toward heiarchies and so on.

It is hard to say how much an "institutional" writer is shaped or moulded
into a certain style or lack of style....a clear example of a writer
"outside" is Faulkner, but there are counter examples: I feel that Beryyman
wasnt 'blocked" or even badly influenced either by his great erudition (and
also fortuantely by his ufortunate affair(s) with the bottle (women), or the
fact that he was a lecturer (often on Shakespear I believe eg))..

True, academics are largely the teachers of culture, but they an also be its
transmitters. As to the "massive schooling of artists" I think that is a
double-edged weapon and could be used by conservatives but could also,
properly managed, be enhancing for literary culture. Richard Taylor.

There's a lot of anti-communst and quite simply racist anti Chinese
propaganda so I cant believe anything of your theory of China, sorry. The
CIA has always funded anti communist and especially anti -Rissian and anti
China reports and books and even whole courses at Harvard and
elsewhere...check out if possible your friend: he's possibly funded by the
CIA.  I debate the nonsense about Tibet which is a very reactionary country
that had the Dali Lama in charge who is nut case and a probably a crook.

But the comparison with China: China in international affairs has always
supported liberal and democratic and great revolutionary movements such as
that by Ho Chi Minh. They stay out of interference in oustide politics. It
is a greatly progessive and progressed country unlike the US which is
rotting with the mire of arrogance and the sins of indulgence and lust and
the bombing and infiltration interference of other countries and
destabilisation and so on and will sink ultimately into the Hell of its own
self-devastation: the Chinese on the other hand are by and large a
happy, stable country, wih happy people living there.No snipers or Church
burners or shool massacres over there! My mate went there: marvellous
openness and liveliness (India by contrast with its corrupt "democracy"
(full of  "moc")): now I find the Indians of India by contrast a possibly
dubious and glum lot who never smile and are always winging about prices)
and people talking openly on every subject. He felt safer in China than in
NZ or Australia (where he's from) where they murder Aboriginees: or have
done...Baraka by the way points to the US genocide of the American Indians
( the 4000 keeps away part  is only a bit of rhetoric I suspect) ...But
China: No Trade Towers bursting in he violet air over there! Study the
philosophy of Mao Tse Tung and read more about politics. Dont just listen to
me: work in factories and experience
real hardships as I have: academics and psychoanalysts and academics and
Jewish haberdashers like Monsieur Harienne Nudelski Etal are cosseted in NY
and (the psychoanalyists ) make money out of the misery of capitalism so
they (subconciously perhaps) dont want it to change: hence there rather
non-commital political stance and Nudelski's extreme right wing views. Most
Tibetans are glad to be with China: they are loyal. Richard Taylor.

apt frantic lift off in the morning. the other shore looks a beaut. regions
maximize in eyes, the startling sea seems gimpy. a poser rests in Tibet,
that's my bridge. your bridge is sent from explaining this minor point. in
the midst of these congeries, a stylized lighthouse, more morose than usual
spans of time. usual people expound their heft, their grammar, their sockful
of sonnets. other people name a proper noun, going home for the evening. the
evening is gone, devastated is a right. the sky is a blue that can be drawn
into the conversation. you were strong and I was reading. Tibet is a better
front than many, heard about the length of days. in the ocean's purview,
rhymes exist and serve sonnets. sonnets die for fame, so hear a sonnet
dying. wind elevates crystals of sand into reports to carry. in your dreams
you write more sonnets. the same dream plans on Tibet's flower. there was a
day in 1982, it was circled with sounds. twenty years later a general dismay
with the climbing sea, where sonnets are more famous still. one more death
isn't counting much. the love is Tibet next to me at night, not the sport
over there.

as i see it, this is a very different question from whether the
leftism of the academy is taken seriously by the governmental right.
you may, unfortunately, be right (as in correct) here, but of course
there is no relationship between "new poetry" and left politics, as
we know from cases like ezra pound and even my beloved gertrude, who,
it cannot be denied, was hopelessly naive politically.

i think whether or not "new poetry" can flourish or even occur in the
academy is very dependent on circumstance.  in my experience,
universities as workplaces are bureaucracies, more or less receptive
to watered-down ideas of "creativity" or "originality" -- and less
receptive in english depts than in, say the sciences.  however, there
is often little relationship between the intellectual lives of the
individual faculty members or students and the workings of the
bureaucracy.  both sides lose, but interesting work can happen in the
interstices, margins, what have you.  and i know i'm speaking from a
particular kind of institution --a "top of the 2nd -rung" land-grant
state research university that is the only ph-d granting institution
in the state and within a 5-hr driving radius (madison is about a 4-5
hr drive, chicago 8).

The desperation that is (finally) all love
would evolve to a warm mull. Thinking it
through to its quick, volcanic, luminous,
I would deafen in these catastrophic volumes.

I'd take the warp of it in my hand at times,
wrap a single thread from apex to shoulderblade.
Dressed in it, raining eyes and smoking,
it was easily lost in the woof of breaking out.

Oh,

I can stand it sometimes. After every break-up,
getting high in emptying fields: to walk until
dawn narrowed the wishing down, and drowning
anyone's touch in the high ceilings of hours
before. It was a little room, yellow with

my lungs. The most appropriate act, as
always, would be to swallow. To spit.

Gerald Stern, a former poet laureate of the state of
New Jersey, in commenting on proposed legislation
that would give Gov. James E. McGreevey the power
to fire Amiri Baraka, the current poet laureate of
New Jersey, says, "It's so pathetic in a way. It's
such a minor position. It's like legislation to remove

You know, Harry. I grew up in a family that really disliked Israel as a
modern state and made up even more absurd conspiracy theories (something
about buying votes for Ronald Reagan, I can't quite remember..). than the
one you believe Bakara is guilty of.

Anyhow, I never thought we were anti-Semites since we were all Jewish..I
wonder if you'd suggest we rethink our position?

I was just going through the archives today and was wondering, Lawrence, if
you had written that review of _Pen Chants_?

In fact, I was wondering if ANYONE had written a review? I'd be interested
in finding out what others, aside from Andrew Rathmann (though I *did* find
his close reading an interesting starting point, not really knowing Susan
Howe etc),  have said about the book.

Thanks,
Ben

Subject: Lissa Wolsak Follow up

I was just going through the archives today and was wondering, Lawrence,
if
you had written that review of _Pen Chants_?

In fact, I was wondering if ANYONE had written a review? I'd be
interested
in finding out what others, aside from Andrew Rathmann (though I *did*
find
his close reading an interesting starting point, not really knowing
Susan
Howe etc),  have said about the book.

Thanks,
Ben

Salvador Dali was not a lama. I believe you are referring to the Dalai

   Repeat Repeat Repeat Repeat..then switch and bait...

   From a private e noting my limitations as a reader..Baraka only sd Sharon
was a right wing general...if Baraka hd sd that Sharon was a
murderer...fcuk..terrorist...war criminal...he would have echoed much of what
is sd in the left wing Israeli Press...so what...and so what if i think that
really applies to Arafat...

    What he sd...and left as an inuendo..is that Sharon knew about 9/11...that
he let thousands of americans die for his devious Zionist Plan...that there
was conspiracy between the Zionists and the Americans to let it happen...and
of course as we know because Zionists rule the World and now rule
America...see today's article on the new Black Panther Party for more of this
line of thot....

    Ben's dysfunctional Jewish Family is a different kind of bait and
switch...i have no idea if they're anti-semitic... i have more nfuf problem
with my own dysfunctional J. famille...i don't know them...i never knew all
the people who defended the Rosenbergs to the die they opened the Soviet
Archives..and what does that have to do with Baraka's anti-semitism...

    Repeat Repeat Repeat Repait...Lie Lie Lie Lie...bait and switch...as for
jewish anti-semitism..let's just leave Gerald Stern floating in the

Nudel, you are the Kenny G of the Poetics list: relentlessly boring,
maliciously off-key, a sad old bugle boy who got no swing.  Half a million
Harry Nudels couldn't carry Amiri's jock.  Take a nap, Grandpa.

Richard, two things about your posts. First, I can not stop myself from
reading them, a kind of linguistic addiction you might say. Second, I can not
sometimes stop from responding to them. Here it is:

> ...But
>
>China: No Trade Towers bursting in he violet air over there!

I thought you said the exploding towers were a thing of beauty; you mean
China lacks this kind of beauty?


>Study the
>
>philosophy of Mao Tse Tung and read more about politics.

Let a thousand flowers "burst" in the country side? I suppose the Cultural
Revolution was the Maoist concept of beauty?


>Dont just listen
>to
>
>me: work in factories and experience
>
>real hardships as I have:

If factories are the only places where one experiences real hardships,
wouldn't the answer be to have no factories at all? For example, in the
United States we should all go to Kansas and plant wheat or corn, or to
tobacco or cotton fields in the South. Come to think of it, the new American
revolution should involve going back to slavery.



>academics and psychoanalysts and academics and
>
>Jewish haberdashers like Monsieur Harienne Nudelski Etal are cosseted in
>NY
>
>and (the psychoanalyists ) make money out of the misery of capitalism


Is your inspiration above Stalin's dissertation on Jewish doctors?

Let me e-mail this before I change my mind.

Best.

  since this has become an ad hominem argu...a bit dif. form of bait and
switch...isn't the real question whether 6 mill. nudels could carry Amiri's
Jockstrap...


   let's get the History straight...Amiri was born to a middle-class family
(father postal supervisor ma social worker? teacher?)

   nudel was born in a displaced person's camp...

   in  summer..1967 Amiri was the toast of Time...the Village Scene
plays.readings
.etc etc..





    nudel was sitting in a Southern La. jail while working for Core...

    in 1968 Amiri was prob. on one of his innumerable grants...

     nudel was suspended for the semester for protesting against Dow
Chemical...


      To cut it short in the 30 years since...Amiri has taught at Yale,
Berkeley, and as Full time prof at SUNY..

      nudel has sold books on the sidewalks of NY...

     a kat kan look at a king...keep switching and baiting..all 6 mill

Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

turn to puns, norms of well-behaved frames
confounded falseness begins with LADY GODIVA
[Gradiva?] red & nicety by the needle
competence too complex to engage the local
my lungs eat away at the Psalmist, my common sense tells
me "readers are not witnesses" - antecedent twists &
turns claim and reclaim Virginia's charms
the mark of more than sufficient law is docility
letters wronged you, didn't they? I can tell.
there's some discrepancy between freedom & biological functions
imperialism was touched off by a syrup of violets, illicit gravedigging is
thought to be indicative of bolshevism
my darling resemblance is a few steps away
even a dip in the mirage - O iron collar! - is shaken by occasion
the huge interiors shook within the custom
sunken functionaries live for her
debt fattened that calf
the bishop's head hangs from my pommel
some trifle sinks heroes into banditry
you card, you threw them all into postponing LAVBESP
is it contumely or reverence that leaves a souvenir where it lies?
a scrap is foreign to its origins - this is very crucial
Virginia bore the Old World into her left shoulder
cold sweat, what do I owe you now? a name less sick for
being forgotten, Virginia, was cut short by waking up early
your three little brothers pace a carpet 800 feet long
unfortunate & manacled, though always welcome

I'm collecting interviews with poets, published and unpublished--especially
with younger/less established, non-mainstream poets, done since 1990 or so.
If you have done one, or been the subject of one, please send me the URL (if
it's online) or let me know where it was published (if in print). If it
wasn't published, let me know too.

Backchannel, please!

This is about Baraka's success and fame and Nudel's lack of success and
fame?  I guess that's what your recent snide Kenneth Koch and Jackson Mac
Low murmurs were about, too? They're famous and you have to sell your books
on the street?  You had disappeared from this list for a while, I can't say
I missed you, Nudel.  You spread little joy here, just misdirected bile.
Baraka has been clear and apologetic about his anti-semitism.  Yours is a
tired and punchless tune.  Keep your day job.

We own nothing and we most
For this don’t “pretend”…
That is, your this and that are flailing
On the socket. Open the port
Hole. You are not going (uh-oh & squeak)
You are not getting. (ka-thump!)
See the world, San Francisco

Land of the Kangaroo, go down.
Since you sissy, following, since
You naked stamping, sister sister
Give me a space just    this     big.

it isn't my theory of china, richard. its the word of many.

i don't like the chinese goverment, it proports to be a system of the
people, but its just capitalism in drag. (complete with feather boa and
those wonderful eyelashes).

as far as the 'great policies of ho chi minh and his theory of great
revolutionary movement',  i am familiar with his theories, but prefer
evolution
rather than revolution.

read history ? my dad was a social scientist and historian. the politics of
conflict and social systems. revolution.

your suggestion that i should work in 'real factories' and suffer 'real
hardship' is lost
on me, richard.
how do you know i haven't ?

your attack on the dalai lama i find sad. when someone advocates compassion
this must be a reason to attack them and their belief system ?
i find this most curious. what would the chinese government have against the
idea of tolerance and compassion as a system of belief ?

evening, & the word "local' daydreams of being a palindrome
the pages of achievement are applied to your painted eyelids
blindfolds pointed in the direction of arm-slings
heavenly mansions burned by rioters, though the land is still marketable
- to a single end, Aspasia authorized Virginia to requisition supplies
discussion is freed from analysis by royal favor alone
Sotades issued a declaration of justification whilst en route to V.
privileges and exemptions are what make this world go 'round, else
Virginia should be in league with the stones in the field
your children stepped inside and consumed him, this wildly-gored S.
concealing a few miles, flint & steel straightened up a new signature
Can I trust you? servants had drifted out of my projections
near the Alps I was as I am now: aptly put
the Black Cat was grasped clubwise so I might defend my good name
born amongst her imperfect gravity, hopeless and generous
shock fainting upon the sofa in habitual detestation
these sins are in favor of quality   --------->
three or four doctors read about your martinetish sightseeing
Virginia unloosed her ouphe and barghest hoop
next weekend, I'll become recently interested in this little beast
like ashes set to bribing the coals, you can guess why!
_____________________________________________________

VIRGINIA, OR THE POT OF BASIL

turn to puns, norms of well-behaved frames
confounded falseness begins with LADY GODIVA
[Gradiva?] red & nicety by the needle
competence too complex to engage the local
my lungs eat away at the Psalmist, my common sense tells
me "readers are not witnesses" - antecedent twists &
turns claim and reclaim Virginia's charms
the mark of more than sufficient law is docility
letters wronged you, didn't they? I can tell.
there's some discrepancy between freedom & biological functions
imperialism was touched off by a syrup of violets, illicit gravediving
thought to be indicative of bolshevism
my darling resemblance is a few steps away
even a dip in the mirage - O iron collar! - is shaken by occasion
the huge interiors shook within the custom
sunken functionaries live for her
debt fattened this calf
the bishop's head hangs from my pommel
some trifle sinks heroes into banditry
you card, you threw them all into postponing LAVBESP
is it contumely or reverence that leaves a souvenir where it lies?
a scrap is foreign to its origins - this is very crucial
Virginia bore the Old World into her left shoulder
cold sweat, what do I owe you? a name less sick for
being forgotten, Virginia, was cut short by waking up early
your three little brothers pace a carpet 800 feet long
unfortunate & manacled, though always welcome

andrew, i came to the university from outside of the university
(after spending time within the university, before which it was k-12,
yes?)... i don't think of the campus as a haven---sure, the naive
impression i had of it while working very un-naively in fortune
500---but i see it as a workplace...

now understood as a workplace, and (again) as maria indicates, a
bureaucratically overdetermined such item, one can't quite attribute
leftism carte blanche either to the workplace itself or to its
various practices... and you mix and match, andrew---if i read you
aright---when you criticize academe for its inability to generate
artistic otherness (a desirable quality, i'd say, and goddamned
difficult to produce under any circumstances) on the basis of its
political sensibility (as it were, if only b/c the two aren't
necessarily intertwined, even in english depts., let alone poets)...

ok:  no doubt intellectuals have by and large been driven into the
university, demographically speaking, over the past 40 years or so
(which again, isn't to suggest that all who are employed by the u are
intellectuals---and i'm not defining my terms here, i agree)... but
even assuming there is anything remotely approaching an intellectual
left in academic poets (i.e., poets who earn their keep, like me, via
academe); and even assuming this intellectual left IS the
avant-garde, by and large (i say if); and even assuming academe
hasn't been real congenial to creative work (to judge by the poetic
output of this intellectual left of a-g poets, say):  this yet would
not permit one to conclude that academe is (academics are) to be
blamed for (let's say) asethetically cautious work... not least b/c
academe doesn't exist in a vacuum---overdetermined or no, its borders
transmit broader cultural currents, and help shape those currents...
just give a listen to 'the factor' to see how many academics appear
on o'reilly, willing to swap rhetorical blows (a pop cultural effect,
at the very least)...

in light of which, i disagree rather strenuously with your
characterization of teachers and scholars as transmitters and
analysts, but not makers... there's a (postromantic) being/doing
split here, for one, with which i'm not comfortable, but even in your
own terms, i "make" as much culture now, certainly, as i did when i
helped miller brewing company manufacture better beer faster, and
more inexpensively, and more safely... wouldn't you agree?...

any institution, understood as a workplace, will bring its own set of
constraints to the artistic process... if one manages a mcdonald's,
god forbid (sorry!), one's workplace will no doubt be at perceived,
broadly, as at some remove from poetry... but the bureaucratization
of mcdonald's is at least as intense as at postsecondary
institutions, meaning one's poetry will (again) pick
up/reveal/transmit/MAKE said effects... and at the same time, you'll
likely have a MUCH harder time finding out where to go to talk with,
and how to talk with, a guy named "andrew rathmann"... even the
discursive machinery you and i et al. are tossing back and forth
(though admittedly, i just intro'd a new term for which i'll no doubt
be hung out to dry), is conditioned by academe...

you can run but you cannot hide...

the tune in/turn on/drop out variant of bohemian (?---not to give the
latter a bad name!) "inspiration" you would seem to be espousing (via
high modernism, ironically) just strikes me as compeletely devoid,
again, of consideration for the very real necessities that come of
earning a living... so if you don't want to hazard talking about
alternatives (for fear of re-creating a systemic entity, i guess,
which i fear too)---and if you don't want to hazard invoking an
existing alternative to the academically-bound versions that, in your
view, overpopulate the poetry industry---why i think you're dreaming,
man...

and i suppose, to be candid, one *could* posit some interesting
poetry from that perspective, too, with enough H20 on hand and a
little, uh, bread... & i suppose that might in fact depend upon the
times, the paradoxes, we're willing to entertain---

best,

joe

I (and I have previously made this point) think that the poetic process is
psychotic (but not that poets are psychotic), in the formal, psychiatric
sense of the word.  In psychosis one has:

delusions: ideas which aren't true and often, make no literal sense but
sometimes have evocative or metaphoric sense, often

        a belief that things carry more meaning than they really do (e.g. "that red
light meant my life is at a                     standstill"),
        that one is a someone one isn't (God, Jesuss, Napoleon, An Alien from Outer
Space, a Great Writer or Artist,                the President...),
        that mysterious forces govern the worls ("themy boss's special powers make
me cut my finger tonight as I                   prepare dinner-- he controls everything I
do")),

hallucinations:

        hearing voices,
        inanimate objects talk,
        one can talk with God or the Devil or Elvis or one's dead relatives

and thought disorder:

        tangential thinking (digressing a lot)
        magical thinking (belief that something affects something it doesn't),
        superstition,
        suspicion,
        clang associations (rhyme, alliteration),
        thought blockage (no way to continue a thought, have to stop taling or
change topics),
        thought insertion an unrelated thought is inserted into a stream of
thought),
        looseness of associations (one thought leads to another which is only
vaguely related ainstead of logically           the next thought in a "normal"
conversation),
        perseveration (going on and one about something, repeating the same thought
in different words, unable to                   change the subject).

You will recoignize many of these as the ways ideas and words are organized
in poems.  Some poetry is overtly psychotic-seeming (and not written by a
psychotic author) such as much of James Tate's poems (not the last book but
the previous three) in whihc he has narrators with full-blown paranoid
fantasies only in a poem it isn't necessarily a fantasy -- there really
could be someone after you that talks to you through your bowl of soup or
whatever.  The "reality" of poems is quite different from the reality of the
natural world and also (this is less understood) from the reality of
fiction.  In ficton, even postmodern bizarre fiction, there is a certain
consistency required in the way the world works.  It can be totally strange,
and everything can suddenly transform itself like magic (as in Calvino's _If
on a winter's night a traveler_) but locally within sections of a fictional
work you have a suspension of disbelief and for that you need a minimum
level of logic to the fictional world.

In poetry, on the other hand, the reality is only sketched and there are big
gaps about which you know nothing (unlike fiction, a poem, at least a modern
poem, usually does not create a whole world) and you aren't supposed to be
able to fill in the gaps to make a sensible world out of what you do know.
In a poem, anything can be true.  Even the simplest poems have a reality
which is bizarre compared to fiction or real life.  In Wiliiams's famous red
wheelbarrow poem, everything DOES depend on the red wheelbarrow.  It is not
a figure of speech or a symbol IN THE WORLD OF THE POEM.  It it simply true.
You have to take it at face value.  However the poem's reality may itself be
symbolic or evocative or allusive or satirical or whatever.

You can read the poem in the usual way in whuch you see figures of speech
and techniques and poetic tricks and so on.  But it is also essential to
read into and accept the reality created by the poem as you read it.  That
is the one of the ways to understand what the poem is doing.  Under this
form of interpretation, it is not the poet or the poem which is psychotic,
but the very structure of the universe.  And being able to conceive of such
a universe is a creative task akin to the actual writing of the poem; you
actually recreate the process of creating the poem as you create the poem's
universe in your head.  But you must abandon (temporarily) the rukles of
sanity to do so.

Tom:

We can play with terms such as psychotic, but what it means is what it
currently means, which is not Greek but Geek.
So that attaching scholarly intent is misleading. The public knows what
psychosis is, or think they do. They see it on the news almost every night.
I see it there, too, but in those who act as if they are "sane."

Murat lives in Hoboken, two blocks west of where i lived from 1993-95.
Murat has a rich, friendly voice with a crunchy Turkish accent. I told him
I used to frequent Maxwell's.  Today Murat does business with Bendas
Oriental Rug Co, a mile north of where I presently live in St. Louis. Murat
told me about the Dodie Bellamy / Kevin Killian reading, which he attended
with Gary "Joke Boy" Sullivan last night, and really enjoyed. I told him we
have a couple of readings a month here in STL, perhaps one good one; he
said that sounded like a good average.  I said we take the rifle approach
here, as opposed to the shotgun.  We get our quarry.

Frankly, the whole time we were talking, I was picturing moving back to the
NYC area.  I think I'd settle in Brooklyn.  It seems so many poets and
artists live there.  But really, who needs to live near poets and artists
when I have a telephone?  I live near the lady at the end of my street, and
I've never even spoken to her. It's the  speaking-to that matters.  I'll
stay in St. Louis for now.

Murat, it'll be great to meet you when I'm up there this November.

Sorry.  The last thing I posted for some reason, inexplicable to myself,
which probably involved hitting a key on this machine inadvertently,
repeats. the last word is "one." the thing is not meant to just keep going

Murat. I thought you were going to say they were a load of rubbish!  I'll
ignore the Trade tower thing - you of course know it is ref. to T S Eiot's
poem and of course I dont really want to see anny more towers being knocked
down: its a bitof hype, but you have to admit - the human tragedy aside -
the whole "show" of S11 was bizzarrely beautiful: also terrible..one thinks
f the term  "a terrible beauty is born"...whoever did it: let's say it WAS
some Al Qeada terrorists: my point though is in "following" Baraka is that
he had a right to ask  "Who?" (as there are a lot of questions to be
answered,...if that's possible)  and also I dont see that he is
anti-semitic: if I met him and found him so I would  not want to know him..

My "beef" with Israel I put very strongly but in reality?  Well I think we
need to all look into the situation in Palestine. BUT I would not back a
racist Arab league either: I dont support Hussein and so on. but I do
support the Iraqi people...

The philosophy of Mao Tse Tung I think should be studied just as much as say
Wittgenstein or Heidegger or any other thinker: I have much admiration for
Mao. However I am well aware that China is not a Utopia: however I dont
think that I have time to explain the things about Mao Tse tung thought and
the cultural revolution that I think made China in a sense the first truly
revolutionary country: now I think that society moves between revolutions
and uprisings and wars and slowly evolves which someone mentioned as being a
supporter of wwell of corse I am too.....  I think though that an argument
about the Cultural Revolution would get us all  bogged down; it all
depending on which books one a has read and one's "class outlook" and also
personal views and whatever: In fact I  would not make a very good Marxist
myself. This is a contradiction I know: I simply am not a conformist: i'm
very much an individualist hence I have never joined eg the Communist Party
although years ago I thought of that.

Factories as you know was 'metonymic' in fact what it might do for some
poeple would be to "bring them down to earth" ...but yes, ultimately such
menial labour we could get rid of: key word: "ultimately"....

I was saying in effect:  the US (State-Industrial Complex etc) looks very
powerful but in fact its good that China is  - not socialist per se - but in
fact militarily being quite the equal of the US: in fact I think that India
is also becoming a force to be reckoned with.  This, paradoxically it might
seem, I see  good: it is to do with off setting the power of US and Israeli
and British Imperialism: in  fact the countries are almost irrelevant as
allegiances shift but at the moment we see the US as an aggressive
Imperialist State which is always a bad sign for it (the Imperialist
country) as it usually signals its coming decline, even demise ...into the
mire of its own Hell  (I'm reading Dorothy Sayer's translation of The Divine
Comedy!)....now China I think is largely a force for good: despite some
hiccups...the sins of Mongolia are very small (there are a lot of bandits in
those outlying regions: and out of 200 milion there are nound to be some bad
eggs some of whom join universities subsidized by other bad eggs!!..) and
also there is the Departments of Misinformation etc, and I do see Tibet
(under The Salvador Lama as  reactionary)...but my point is that it
represents a powerful "block" to US Imperialism.

Of course there's no guarantee that China wont fold to Macdonald burgers and
Holywood and all the excessive materialist crap of the West or even become
an agressor State itself but they havent shown such tendencies yet. ok they
might "embrace materialism" - but who doesnt..who doesnt starves to
death...I'm talking about the feverish emptiness, the snipers, the
psychoses, at the core of Western societies...and so on....

I see also slowly developing a powerful block from Palestine through to
China even in league with some of the states such as Turjikistan and even
India: potentially without the US and if they could form an alliance of some
kind they could all become very prosperous and aso a large State...in fact
the US Imperialitss are frightened of such potential leagues. (they will or
could elwel  become redundant and "wither away"..)  Hence the US
Imperialists continue to destabilise and bully other countires in the
interests of power over resources and potential cheap labour sources and
also the ability to manipulate people into the way they want tmem to be
(which is generally, under a dictatorship of some kind and very poor). Here
is where Baraka, loose cannon he may be, comes in.....everyone is ignoring
his powerful critique of the many wrongs and are simply seeing him as
anti-semitic: when its called "strong rhetoric" and it is also called
criticism of the status quo. That said - I dont like his style of poetry
...or I havent up to now...or maybe I'm starting to like it more....at least
there's some meaning in what he is saying: his rhetoric and apparent
"refentiality" I know CAN also be dangerous we can get mesmerised by this
kind of stuff: I too read the technical journals...) some passion however
false we may feel that passion might be. I'm also interested in the new
Black Panthers....!! Richard Taylor.

the splurge of pink atmospheric, to say you sleep in today. and the world
arms heavily painted instants with reading papers till tomorrow. at maximum
the cudgel expresses sweaty Tibetan loss. this is privacy, which we always
wreak in public. so there is a saying, planted firmly by the most bilious.
it loses unction and turns to strong effort on the map of where we become a
sad state of affairs. this is the merry town now, after all this work. a
dream is a wish report, until it is time to speak again. everyone screws up
explaining, there's too much map to behold. so Tibet is a monstrance, as big
as your moronic friend who stays with you often, speaking always or you have
had enough. welcome a description of some country you almost believe in,
where you won't be quite so nervous. colours have grown heavy, and it isn't
even funny to watch leaves fall so tragically. you sleep in today and three
leaves tumble from a tree. the tree is a mere maple, a ground rule easily
ignored.

In the spirit of day spending, I just spent one with Bob Rosenthal.  Bob is
trustee of Allen Ginsberg's estate and was his secretary from the 1970s until
the end.  He's also a cool poet in his own write.  We talked; we laughed; we
had lunch; we travelled by train together, reliving our pasts.  I learned
more about Allen, Bill, Gregory, Jack, Philip Lamantia, McClure,
Ferlinghetti, et al than I can ever hope to remember.  Great day!  Best, Bill

I agree with Joe Amato that Andrew Rothman's notion that the most daring
poetry must come from the outside is relentlessly romantic and more than a
little out of date.

That said, I think that Joe and Maria's defense of how poetry CAN take place
along the seams, let's say, of academic life--an argument I myself have often
made--feels less and less adequate to my sense of contemporary poetic
circumstances.

The problem, as I see it, is not that daring poetry MUST come from outside the
academic context. The problem is that it's increasingly--not absolutely,
increasingly--impossible for ANY poetry to come from outside the academic
context.

I'm not saying that there aren't many great poets who are not academics, by
any means--we have a bunch here in DC, people like Heather Fuller, Rod Smith,
Buck Downs. But the problem is that such poets can be to a greater and greater
degree simply ignored, beyond the local environment. Again, not absolutely.
But more and more so.

It was possible, perhaps even through the 70s? the 80s? for poets to establish
significant profiles as poets by publishing, their whole lives, entirely in
the small presses and small magazines. But at best, now, such poets receive
marginal attention, if any at all.

So, sure, poetry can be written outside the academic world, and sure, it can
be written inside the academic world. I find both those points true, if a
little obvious, since poetry has an amazing ability to be written under ANY
circumstances. But the increasing hegemony of academic production means that,
these days, increasingly, academic success=poetic value, in the short run
anyway (who knows what of this poetry will survive? does it matter to us?).
Non-academic poets are second rate citizens at best, if they're allowed any
cache as citizens at all.

My challenge then is this: more attention needs to be paid to poets who are
not part of the academic machine, or who are more marginally part of it, not
because they're better, but just because, you know, they MIGHT be.

I'd love to see a list of poets you like, right now, who are not primarily top
shelf academics. Let's discuss their work at least for once.

Maintain the possibility of, sometimes, stepping outside--

I Reply:

I fundamentally disagree with you. I'd rather talk about poetry that moves me,
than to research a poet's biography to see what s/he does for a living. And
what is "top shelf" anyway? I don't know. Really. Could we talk about a poet
who works at a university (or maybe even a college?) if we decided s/he
wasn't "top shelf"? Or "primarily"? Too much work for me. It's hard enough
just finding great poetry amid all the piles of paper . . .

And, of course, we're having this discussion on the back of a "top shelf"
academic institution . . . the commonest of ironies . . . sending anti-
academic emails through the Buffalo.edu distribution system! Talk about
"academic machines." Literally.

The shelving at most universities I've worked at is in pretty sad shape --
[except in Dean's Offices, where they seem to spend a great deal of money on
shelves to hold their family pictures and objects picked up on their foreign
travels] -- What starts out top shelf may easily wind up floored before long --


But isn't it the "job" of an academic critic of contemporary poetry to go beyond
the more prominent AWP/MFA journals and check out what's getting written
wherever and by whoever?  Buck Downs and Rod Smith and Heather Fuller  are
certainly on my list of important poets these days -- I think giovanni
singleton is not a professor (haven't seen her for a while so don't know fer
sure) -- I wouldn't begrudge any poet a chance to make a living at a university
-- It's not the kind of living you could make elsewhere, but elsewhere probably
won't pay you to read books and write --

And the few other places that DO pay people to read books & write (the
mainstream newspaper book reviews and mags) seem even more unlikely to hire the
likes of US -- no?  Do you HAVE to work at USC to review poetry in the LA
TIMES?

---------------------
"[T]he social command is constituted by 'the presence of a problem in
society, whose solution is imaginable only in poetic terms'. One must not
confuse this – as it seems that we have tried hard to do for almost half a
century – with the 'practical command' (i.e., 'actual commissions')
constituted by the existence, in society, of solutions that the poetic work
has as its function to illustrate. These two conceptions are irreducible to
each other, and do not coincide. […]

What remains is to entirely exit this problem, and to denounce, in this
relation – social command, practical command – the functioning of ideology
as fashion system."

—Jean-Claude Montel (1973, French trans. L. Cabri)


TO OUR DEPOSITORS

Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky invented, with critic Osip Brik, the idea
of a “social command” – perceptible as “the presence of a problem in
society, whose solution is imaginable only in poetic terms.”

Fifty years later, French novelist/critic Jean-Claude Montel distinguished
between “social command” and “actual commission.” To write from a “social
command” is non-reducible to the immediate, instrumental ends of a protest
poem commissioned for a particular march or political function.

UNITED BANK may be said to listen-up for today’s “social commands” in order
to make ideology perceptible as ideology, fashion as fashion. The word
“social” exists within every word as a declaration of dependence on the
palpable world. Commanding and commanded by this world, every word is a
metropolis.

Levy (November). "UNITED BANK," a Slought Networks storefront series, is

Perhaps what would be most helpful to readers of this list at this point,
Nudel, is for you to explain the racism contained in some of your
mutterings.  The brown bagged beverage and bacon a few days ago.  And this
strange piece on Chris Webber:

http://vox.popula.com/drn/020200.html

You get little sympathy here for being oppressed by me.  Your wailings are
boring and hypocritical.  Why don't you post a poem in response to Baraka's
poems, instead of your elliptical crybabyisms?  I'm just a guy who likes
Baraka's work. You just have nothing better to do with yourself.

Thanks, Mark, for writing about this. I don't agree about the nature of the
current situation. But maybe I'm missing a step here?

This is a point of view, one that privileges reception within the academy
and ignores the active reception of poetry taking place outside the academy,
as though the latter were in some way inconsequential. In other words, all
of the books being read, Web sites visited, poets and poetry written about
in (non-academic) newspapers, magazines and books, all of the work that is
discussed verbally.

It's a point of view that takes for granted the idea of "the increasing
hegemony of academic production" without bringing to bear on the argument
the various venues and sites where non-academic poetic production *is*
recognized, supported, encouraged, rewarded, and granted status--daily. All
of which activity I think matters enormously, to most everyone interested in
the art--at least outside the local environment of the academy.

Maybe I should ask, since I'm not sure what you mean by "increasing hegemony
of academic production" ... can you maybe unpack that?

The current war of postings between Harry Nudnik et al and between Richard Taylor and his various adversaries about the various merits or demerits of certain current governments all reflect the position that particular governments have been, are, or can be qualified to judge the moral fitness of other governments.  A knowledge of history of the government that I know best, the American government renders this position untenable.  To cite just the two main instances of moral unfitness to judge, I mention that no government in the history of the United States has ever commanded the votes of a majority of its citizens, for a wide variety of well-known reasons;  and that no American government has ever lived up to any treaty obligation (not so well-known:  think of the 800 or so treaties with native nations, about half of which the U.S. didn't even bother to ratify before proceeding to break them) and so can be in no position to judge any other nation's treaty compliance.

I can even anticipate the common response to this posting:  such activities may have occurred in the past, but things are different now.  Even a cursory glance at the current mainstream media reveals the incredible naivete (or worse) of this position.

The top shelf is the one with dust on it.

>>Do you HAVE to work at USC to review poetry in the LA TIMES?

While that has a long history, I think a lot of it has to do with the
proximity of the TIMES offices to 'SC.  When I was working in a dog food
factory in Vernon, I became attuned to all of the news inches given to
the slaughterhouses along the river because they are near the TIMES.

But 'SC is good at cultural imperialism.  These are no longer MFAs who
have never heard of experimental poetry.  They are PhDs Marjorie Perloff
has said seem bright who (with some notable exceptions) won't deign to
talk to people who write experimental poetry.

Or, did Wanda Coleman review *poetry* for the LA Times?

More alarming is the loss of first the LA Weekly to the Voice, and now
the New Times to the Voice.  Qualification for reviewing in the Voice or
VLS being some sort of NYC presence, if not residence.  At least the LA
Weekly ran local neoformalist reviews occasionally.  Apparently if you
are willing to suck up, USC's on-campus literary salon is "open."

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

I haven't been following this thread completely, but here's my two cents:

People who work in academia don't experience the same world as social
workers. Social workers don't experience the same world as auto mechanics,
etc. As such, they often lose sight of events happening outside their areas
of specialization.

The academy does have the power to designate certain writers as part of the
canon. A person writing for poetry slams can't do this. Professors can sell
copies of their books by placing them on their course readings lists. A
non-academic can't do this.

By and large, though, the sales aren't going to make a lot of difference in
terms of affecting the general culture. (Unfortunately).

Although I don't write overtly political poetry---if a poem I write is
political it expresses itself as it goes---I don't think any "poetry system,
"---academia, slams, etc--- has an advantage in establishing a political
poetry. They have equal difficulties in finding an audience.

Political poetry can take a variety of forms. As one writer suggested, one
form of radical poetry involves questioning the ways in which we use
language. On the other hand, Baraka has written a clearly political poem
with a message that has stirred up a serious ruckus.
You can write political poems which "mean" or "refuse to mean." The average
reader will want a simple straightforward message and will still have
trouble with Baraka. If you want to play music at a demonstration, Peter
Paul & Mary will get a faster response than Schoenberg.


As far as any poet getting published in a way that will guarantee them a
readership and an influence over the way a society operates on behalf of its
citizens, the "Baltimore Bullet" probably has a better chance of finding a
publisher for his work than a dedicated poet writing work deserving serious
consideration in any format, from sonnet to langpo.

Moreover, many people intensely involved in politics are not as intensely
interested in literature.

Take it for what it's worth.

Richard,

I was pulling your leg a little. Sometimes your writing is like a trip (good
or bad), and I was trying to trip from your trip.

I do agree that Baraka's poem in question is not anti-Semitic though it is
violently anti-Israeli. In fact, he lists the jews as one of the historical
victims along with blacks, etc.. Still those lines about 4000.00 Israelis
being warned is hard to take.

I agree there is something poetic about Mao Tse Tung, his pronouncements, his
slogans, his utopian dreams. Did you read Ed Friedman's "Mao and Matisse"? On
the other hand, Richard II was a poet king also. Look what happened to him.
And what about Ludwig?

I know you meant factory figuratively;but the way you were going on, I was
sorely tempted.

Best.

Hi Vernon:

>as part of the canon. A person writing for poetry slams can't do this.

I know what you mean, but I'm still not with this idea that poetic value is
created increasingly by the academy. A "slam" person--Bob Holman, for
instance--can co-edit a poetry guide on about.com that I would guess has at
least as many (probably more) active readers as Norton.

Take a look at these Amazon.com sales rankings for two books, both published
in 1994:

Aloud: Voices from the Nuyorican Poets' Cafe
Amazon sales rank: 21,579

Postmodern American Poetry: A Norton Anthology
Amazon sales rank: 40,459

It doesn't seem to be a parody. The price is on par with the starting
price for Barbie houses. The "World Peacekeeper Set" is cheaper -- $25 for
a sandbagged little zone, with soldier included, and a whole mess o'
grenades. Rather a Reaganesque definition of "peacekeeper."

No, it's there...I saw it at a Rochester, New York store about two weeks
ago.

But that's only the half of it...all toy stores...everywhere are arming
themselves to the teeth with every hideous commando/metamorpho thing
possible...the build-up's been underway since about July...

...I wonder what will happen to all those toys should we  not actually go
into Iraq...Or is it all well-timed so that when they're all sold by
CHRISTmas, every kid will be well-armed by the January/February invasion?
Hmmm...

Catherine: my info is 14 years out-of-date.but when my book won the Wesern
States Award , the LA Times ran a poem of mine because they said they no
longer reviewed poetry. (I thought this was a good trade-off).  David

The top shelf is the one with dust on it.

>>Do you HAVE to work at USC to review poetry in the LA TIMES?

While that has a long history, I think a lot of it has to do with the
proximity of the TIMES offices to 'SC.  When I was working in a dog food
factory in Vernon, I became attuned to all of the news inches given to
the slaughterhouses along the river because they are near the TIMES.

But 'SC is good at cultural imperialism.  These are no longer MFAs who
have never heard of experimental poetry.  They are PhDs Marjorie Perloff
has said seem bright who (with some notable exceptions) won't deign to
talk to people who write experimental poetry.

Or, did Wanda Coleman review *poetry* for the LA Times?

More alarming is the loss of first the LA Weekly to the Voice, and now
the New Times to the Voice.  Qualification for reviewing in the Voice or
VLS being some sort of NYC presence, if not residence.  At least the LA
Weekly ran local neoformalist reviews occasionally.  Apparently if you
are willing to suck up, USC's on-campus literary salon is "open."

Be well,

they ran reviews, but only by USC faculty

then they ran no reviews

and they ran poems published by local places, etc.

then they ran reviews by USC faculty

then they ran poems which could have only been chosen by USC faculty

and the occasional poem by a USC faculty-member

(which they still do)
then they started running reviews by USC faculty

Hello Poeticists,
I'll probably sound a bit off-topic here  but I
thought most poets who work as academics do it
more-than-partly because, usually, there's no salary
paid for writing poetry.

is it just my email client or is it the buffalo server? but all my posts
from ubpoetics have the return address of the original poster removed so
you can't tell who its from if they haven't signed their post, and you
can't backchannel to original poster.
are others having the same problem?

Attached: Biographical background for Philip Whalen

For a comprehensive collection of Web links related to Whalen's life and =

work, see <www.tomraworth.com/whalen.html>.

Spare Room is a semi-regular reading series with a focus on innovative=20
writing.


BIOGRAPHICAL BACKGROUND:

Philip Glenn Whalen was born on October 20, 1923 in Portland, Oregon and =

grew up in The Dalles. After serving in the Army Air Forces as a radio=20
mechanic in WW II, he attended Reed College on the GI Bill. Among his=20
classmates were fellow poets Gary Snyder and Lew Welch.

"He was a poet's poet," said Gary Snyder, on hearing of his friend's=20
death. "His intelligence and skill is very subtle and very deep. There=20
are many poets who feel in his debt." Snyder and Whalen exchanged=20
letters for many years, "about politics, philosophy, literature,=20
poetics, Buddhist practice and Buddhist thought -- all on a kind of fun=20
level . . . He reminded me of Dr. Samuel Johnson. His humor was dry,=20
witty, ironic and learned," said Snyder. "It was always very =
instructive."

During his army days Whalen had read Gertrude Stein, and a week-long=20
visit to Reed by William Carlos Williams in 1947 further stimulated his=20
interest in poetry. In the summer of 1951 he moved to San Francisco,=20
meeting Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg soon after.  (He appears in=20
fictionalized form in two of Kerouac's novels: as Ben Fagan in Big Sur=20
and Warren Coughlin in Dharma Bums.)

On October 6, 1955, Whalen joined Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Michael=20
McClure, Philip Lamantia, and Gary Snyder for the historic Six Gallery=20
reading (at which Ginsberg's "Howl" was first publicly heard). Organized =

by poet Kenneth Rexroth, the reading took place in a former auto repair=20
shop at Fillmore and Union for an audience of 150. The poets -- most of=20
whom hadn't met before that night -- became instant celebrities, and the =

"San Francisco Renaissance" (as it came to be known) was in full swing.=20
Whalen's work began appearing in print with regularity thereafter, and=20
was included in Donald Allen's epochal anthology The New American Poetry =

in 1959.

 From 1958 until 1971 Whalen lived mostly in Japan: "That was when I was =

doing a lot of writing. I would write every morning." In 1959 his first=20
book, Self-Portrait, from Another Direction, was published by the=20
Auerhahn Press in San Francisco. Memoirs of an Interglacial Age and=20
another volume of poems, Like I Say, appeared in 1960. More than twenty=20
books, including three novels, followed during Whalen's life.

Whalen eventually returned to San Francisco and the Hartford Street Zen=20
Center, where he spent most of the rest of his life. He was ordained a=20
Zen Buddhist monk in 1973, taking the name Zenshin Ryufu=20
("Zen-mind-dragon-wind"), and later became Abbot, caring for AIDS=20
patients until his own ill-health prevented that.

"A degenerative eye disease stopped him writing and reading in 1987; but =

friends would read aloud to him and he was able to have a weekly sushi=20
meal with Michael McClure and Diane diPrima. The darkness must have been =

a burden to such an erudite and literate man but he bore it with=20
consistent humour and energy: when I saw him last a few years ago I had=20
only to mention a book and he was up and moving, his arm swinging to the =

exact spot on the shelf," wrote British poet Tom Raworth in an obituary=20
in the Independent.

In his last days, Whalen maintained his wit and self-deprecating style;=20
when asked by a friend if he wanted a milkshake, he replied, "No, I'd=20
like what they gave Socrates," and discussing his funeral with friends=20
whom he thought were treating the subject too morbidly, he said: "I'd=20
like to be laid on a bed of frozen raspberries."

Philip Whalen died June 26, 2002 in San Francisco.

I think Gary's analysis is on the nose. Slam readings and the web itself have
created new ways of communicating and reading, which are having a slow, often
checkered, but profound effect on the nature of poetry.

(With all due respect, if I may---)

I take it that what those Amazon numbers
(uninterpreted and uncaptioned) are meant to
self-evidently prove

is that the book ~Aloud,~ by out-selling the Norton
Post-Modern Anthology there, carries a greater value
on that particular scale: poetic value would not,
then, be created increasingly or solely by the
academy.  The academic Norton Anthology has only half
the numerical clout of the non-/anti-academic ~Aloud.~

But that very measurement of Amazon sales rates is a
barometer or thermometer that indicates something very
different from that claim!  A higher sales ranking
(~Aloud~: 21,579) is seen as better, more "successful"
than a lower ranking (Norton: 40,459) because 21,579
approaches closer to the magical stratosphere of
bestsellers, Top Ten and Numero Uno.


But where the highest value equals highest ranking
finds Numero Uno to in fact be

"I Don't Know How She Does It: The Life of Kate Reddy,
Working Mother",

number 2 to be "Live from New York: An Uncensored
History of Saturday Night Live",

number 5 to be "Bringing Down the House: The Inside
Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for
Millions",

or even the lofty number 12 to be "The Sopranos Family
Cookbook: As Compiled by Artie Bucco",

the value is anything but what could be called poetic
value!  The value is no longer even literary.

The value of ~Aloud~ being that much further up the
totem pole, rather, becomes its being all that much
closer to and sharing in whatever the mysterious
qualities of even number 22, "I'm Gonna Like Me:
Letting Off a Little Self-Esteem" by Jamie Lee
Curtis---

Whatever the definite function is that those books
serve in the life of their consumers (I don't want to
be sneering or contemptuous of those consumers' rights
to read whatever pastimes they choose), it's simply
not at all the same chemistry or universe as anything
that like "poetic value."


Vernon's point about the canon ---and his key-word
was, I think, "power"--- is that, with the canon, you
reach into posterity and the future: right or wrong
and although it changes over time, the canon is what's
passed from generation to generation, with all the
authority that accrues from that.  It's a ~long-term~
bond or investment.  It owns tomorrow.  But what the
Amazon top numbers bespeak is completely the converse:
it's willfully ephemeral, it's journalistic, it's
"Dare to Repair: A Do-It-Herself Guide to Fixing
(Almost) Anything in the Home", number 19.

The academic has in fact made a greater ~prior~ value
investment ---in tuition, mainly, and probably in time
and effort, studying, often geographically relocating
to school--- to reach being part of the target
audience of the Norton Anthology than the
~Aloud~-shopper likely makes, having found out about
it through hometown slams, radio, etc.  Value of any
kind is constituted in different ways.


(I am no longer, incidentally, arguing for or against
academic/non-academic being "better."  That's all too
tired and, at this sulphurous hour, lilliputian and,
as Gerald Stern said, pathetic, like legislation for
firing the dog catcher.  What I am trying to emphasis
is how these measures can be ~different~ from each
other, different to the point of non-equivalent.)


The sheer democratic force of your good populism is
commendable, but---

That added dimension of ~power~ has to be plotted back
into any appraisal of value, realistically. It's not
only a question of x-many bought X and y-many bought Y
(that plain a question yields chiefly the value of
profit, to the booksellers, publishers, and so on) but
~who~ comprises x and ~who~ comprises y.  A small
circulation but high production Palm Beach magazine I
read while on vacation, with a weekly column written
by Prince Michel of Yugoslavia and a feature by H.R.H.
The Prince of Wales about his private gardens, proudly
announces that its small readership and subscriber
base has a per capita income of so many million
dollars! or so many hundred thousand.  That's the
bottom line that underscores the academia question.
It's all very lovely to prize Everyman and every
reader in some sort of Whitmanian magnanimity, but the
charm and patina of such humanism, like virtue, has
its own reward, and is operating outside the
strictures or principles of value formation.


I believe there may also be distortion in generalizing
from the prolific non-academic poetry establishments
~that we find in New York City~ to elsewhere.
Elsewhere, only a few miles outside the metropolitan
centers, there is simply ~nothing,~ as far as poetry.
There's $12.95 per page for an on-line essay on "My
Last Duchess."

http://www.essays.cc/free_essays/e5/qmr231.shtml

We'll never revisit the poetic purity of audience that
J. Gallagher has reading to her cats and daughter (
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0210&L=poetics&D=1&P=14327
).








{Meow.}

-------------------------------------------------------
Hi Vernon:

  >The academy does have the power to designate
certain writers
  >as part of the canon. A person writing for poetry
slams can't do this.

  I know what you mean, but I'm still not with this
idea that poetic value is
  created increasingly by the academy. A "slam"
person--Bob Holman, for
  instance--can co-edit a poetry guide on about.com
that I would guess has at
  least as many (probably more) active readers as
Norton.

  Take a look at these Amazon.com sales rankings for
two books, both published
  in 1994:

  Aloud: Voices from the Nuyorican Poets' Cafe
  Amazon sales rank: 21,579

  Postmodern American Poetry: A Norton Anthology
  Amazon sales rank: 40,459

Thanks for the update. Sounds to be a frustrating state of affairs. why do

they ran reviews, but only by USC faculty

then they ran no reviews

and they ran poems published by local places, etc.

then they ran reviews by USC faculty

then they ran poems which could have only been chosen by USC faculty

and the occasional poem by a USC faculty-member

(which they still do)
then they started running reviews by USC faculty

i dont know how many bay area people are on this list,
but those that are should try to make it out to san
francisco state on halloween day (430pm) to see
alejandro murgia read at the poetry center.
he is a great fiction writer, poetry writer and has
been a great literary voice for the chicano community
as well as an activist in latin america. his short
story in winter 93 zyzzyva is awesome as is his book
of short stories, southern front( about  international
volunteers who go to nicaragua to join the
sandanistas). mostly interesting to me is his
collaborative effort : volcan an anthology of latin
american poetry in translation. i also had him  as an
instructor and he was quite inspiring and challenging.

hope some of you can go!

The girls wind as rigorous as they are sour.
Soothing myself at intervals with medications
illicit, just a trunk with balloon head
is dear enough. Fluffy girls. Reading Ashbery

in the long no-ceiling hallway of smoking outside
Satterfield hall, just a truck with a balance

A skip over geography with soft fossils of warm

Hi Gary

I haven't sensed an increase in the power of the academy because I've worked
and lived outside of the academy for 30+ years.  The increase in creative
writing programs might have created a stronger network of writers within the
academy and increased their access to university presses. But they don't
control publishers row or the small press world.  I  doubt that university
press titles sell better than some small presses. Holman is an excellent
promoter, no question about it. And poets who appear in the Nuyorican
Anthology get read twice as often as the poets in the postmodern anthology
who write in a related vein. (You should see my numbers at Amazon.com.
They're impressive, but the sales aren't. Further proof that:) Ultimately,
poets inside or outside
of the academy need all the help they can get, from wherever they can get
it.

I was still living in DC when the LA TIMES made its announcement that it
would no longer run reviews of poetry books.  I learned of it, as did many
in DC, when Jonathan Yardley published a screed in the WASHINGTON POST
suggesting that the POST should follow LA's example because, according to
Mr. Yardley, nobody knew what was good and what wasn't in poetry any more
and, besides, nobody read the stuff any more.  What Yardley had left out of
his account, of course, was the part about the LA TIMES deciding, in lieu
of reviews, to run actual poems each week!  All of this has since become
moot -- the POST, having the newly-annointed post of poet laureate on the
hill, began running poetry columns by present and former laureates -- and
the LA TIMES, discovering that Carol Muske Dukes and David St. John were
now at USC and winning awards, suddenly and without comment began running
poetry reviews again -- they some times make room for Wanda Coleman because
she used to write a column for the LA TIMES sunday mag and because she will
always generate lots of mail ---

the USC connection is partly location and partly due to the fact that some
LA TIMESers, like Howard Rosenberg, teach there --- God help us if we
expect them to look beyond the rolodex on their desks for something like a
writer -- I know that the only times I ever got to review for the
WASHINGTON POST were the result of the fact that a guy I went to school
with was working there for a time -- haven't heard from them, or any other
newspaper, since he left --

It's kind of like the musical chairs game that gets played on tv news shows
-- the same experts appear on all the stations spouting the same expertise --

Unfortunately, university hiring committees are often no better at locating
talent,,,, too many of them all run after the same small coterie of
candidates --


Speaking of which, let me remind everybody that Penn State has an open rank
position in African American lit. -- If you know somebody good, send them
our way --

the 'slam' reading and web poetry were preceded by spoken word performance
poetry in the 60s and 70s, and something else before that and that spoken
word poetry is different from published poetry and has qualities of its own
and not judge it by print published poetry standards. after all print
published poetry is the currency of academia, the saleable commodity for
publishers, editors, book sellers etc. and has little interest in poetry in
other media.

the thing is poetry is a local activity and an academic study.
in the local activity performance is equally as important if not more
important than publication. but when academics try to see the 'big picture'
to define national poetries, there is only the published archive to study.
in the past this has meant the setting up of canons, based on the published
archive. lately people have been more interested in seeing poetry not only
within literature but  the culture in which it exists in as well.

poetry has become a global activity and the major publishers have declared
it is no longer financially viable to publish poetry, that there isn't a
large enough reading audience to publish individual collections of
contemporary poets. this has made publication a more localized activity
again as in the 1970s and 1980s with the flourishing of small presses and
of course the on-line poetry journals, zines, and digital poetries, which
highlight localized activity to a global audience.

no matter how hard the academy tries to control the agenda of poetry it
can't, and i believe, probably stopped trying to in the mid 1980s. the
local activity of poetry has a much greater effect on people's lives directly.
the discussion about baraka on this list lately is a prime example.

what i see we have today is lots of different localized activities of
poetry all over the world, not necessarily having style as a common
interest, but thematically linked, the ethno-poets, the eco-poets, the
gender-poets, the theory-poets, the digital-poets, the code-poets, the
left-poets, the cowboy-poets, the bush-poets, as well as physically
localized groups around cities and towns, buffalo-poets, albany-poets, the
toronto poets, melbourne anarchist poets, sydney poets union poets,
subvoicive poets in the uk, etc etc etc. it would be impossible to list all
the localized groups of poetic activity.

even the university presses are no longer considering the publication of
poetry as a priority. this will have a devastating effect on academics who
in the past have been able to ensure their tenure with a healthy
publication record.

well which ever way you take your poetry, you have to enjoy what you are
doing i suppose. i enjoy experimenting with digital poetry, talking about
poetic culture on this list and organizing and participating in a monthly
spoken word poetry event at my local arts co-operative at the gold coast.

Hungarian Author Wins Nobel Prize in Literature
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

Filed at 8:23 a.m. ET



STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Imre Kertesz, a Hungarian who survived
Auschwitz as a teenager, won the Nobel Prize in literature Thursday for
writing that ``upholds the fragile experience of the individual against
the barbaric arbitrariness of history.''

The Swedish Academy singled out his 1975 debut novel, ``Sorstalansag''
(``Fateless''), in which he writes about a young man who is arrested
and taken to a concentration camp but conforms and survives.

``For him Auschwitz is not an exceptional occurrence,'' the academy
said. ``It is the ultimate truth about human degradation in modern
experience.''

The 72-year-old Kertesz, a Jew born in Budapest, was deported to
Auschwitz in 1944, then to Buchenwald, where he was liberated in 1945.

``The refusal to compromise in Kertesz's stance can be perceived
clearly in his style, which is reminiscent of a thickset hawthorn
hedge, dense and thorny for unsuspecting visitors,'' the citation said.

``Fateless'' was the first of a trilogy of novels reflecting on the
Holocaust. In ``A kudarc'' (``Fiasco''), published in 1988, an aging
author writes a novel about Auschwitz that he expects to be rejected.
When the book, to his surprise, is published, he feels only emptiness
and a loss privacy.

``Kaddish a meg nem szueletetett'' (``Kaddish For a Child Not Born''),
the third work of the trilogy, is a short novel published in 1990. The
narrator is a middle-aged Holocaust survivor who has become a writer
and literary translator. He agonizes over the effects of his past,
lamenting he cannot raise a child in so cruel a world and looking back
on a failed marriage and disappointing career.

Kertesz's other works include such nonfiction collections as ``The
Holocaust as Culture,'' ``Moments of Silence While the Execution Squad
Reloads'' and ``The Exiled Language.''

The Nobel award is worth about $1 million.

The 18 lifetime members of the 216-year-old Swedish Academy make the
annual selection in deep secrecy at one of their weekly meetings and do
not even reveal the date of the announcement until two days beforehand.

Nominees are not revealed publicly for 50 years, leaving the literary
world to only guess about who was in the running. However, many of the
same critically acclaimed authors are believed to be on the short list
every year.

Last year's award went to perennial favorite V.S. Naipaul, a British
novelist and essayist born in Trinidad to parents of Indian descent.

A week of Nobel Prizes started Monday with the medicine award, followed
Tuesday by physics and Wednesday by chemistry and economics.

The Nobel Peace Prize winner will be named Friday in Oslo, Norway, the
only Nobel not awarded in Sweden.

Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite,
specified in his will endowing the awards that nationality should not
be a consideration, but many believe the Swedish Academy tries to
spread the honor over different geographical areas.

Nobel otherwise gave only vague guidance about the prize, saying that
it should go to those who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit
on mankind'' and ``who shall have produced in the field of literature
the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.''

The prizes always are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death in 1896.

Hi Gary (and Al and everyone):

Thanks for raising all those concerns--I have them too about my own argument.
I absolutely agree that there continues to be a poetry world outside the
academic environment--in fact it's one that I've been committed to for many
years, running a poetry series that's not university based, working with small
presses, etc, and doing all this as someone who works at the university (well,
several, and never mind that my job sucks; believe me, I know). And I agree
too that one can still point to the occasional--the occasional--poet who rises
to broad recognition (a highly troubled notion of "poetic success," but
still...) outside the academic context, like Bob Holman, although we could
debate how high profile he is, or whether that's because of his poetry or his
admirable--I mean this absolutely seriously--entrepreneurial activities on the
part of poetry. But I think we're past the time, at least for now, where the
world of poetry, as separate from the world of the academy, has much power to
create many such figures--and it seems to me, that power continues to be on
the wane. I think that's why this problem needs to be discussed now (whether
or not I'm right about all the features of it), and not be displaced into
questions about whose social position is more legitimate as a source of
poetry. I'm sincerely worried about the sustainability of communities of
alternative poetry. Perhaps too worried, from your point of view. But I'm not
sure.

Living in NYC, of course, you're in an environment where alternatives to
academic hegemony are still alive and well, to a certain degree--and that's
the case in San Francisco also, and many other cities have smaller versions of
such communities, as we do here in DC. But I think their level of autonomy is
increasingly co-opted. I'm not contesting that the work is out there; I'm only
trying to say that I think there have been some fundamental changes in how
that work is perceived. And I think NYC has changed too, in terms of the
relationship between its high profile poets and academic success.
Increasingly, academic success is a pre-requisite for a high profile. Not
absolutely, increasingly. Please understand that I'm NOT criticizing
academically successful poets; we all, I think, share this problem, although
our individual relationships to it are different.

It's not simply about academic institutions, of course, it's about the
difficulty of maintaining production options that are not thoroughly dominated
by connections to U.S. institutional power, generally and in specific
instances. For instance, what was the last book of significant poetics not
published by an academic press in the United States? There have been a
few--let's list them, please--but not many. Sun and Moon is more or less gone
as a viable entity in that regard; almost all of Roof's books of poetics are
pushing ten years old and more. There are a lot of great small presses, but
almost all of them are hard pressed for cash and have poor distribution. Time,
resources, opportunities are all increasingly available to poets and
poet-critics primarily through their connections to universities. I'm
certainly glad that those resources are there--better there than nowhere. But
I think--maybe this was even the impetus of my post--that we need to be a
little more cautious about the effects this is having on poetry, and about our
own relation to it.

While I don't agree with Andrew Rathman and others who say that the only good
poetry can come from outside the academy, I think I sympathize a little with
some of the concerns they're expressing--a feeling of being cornered by
academic power. Gary, when you write the following, I agree, only I think I'm
not the one (you aren't either) who's doing it: "This is a point of view, one
that privileges reception within the academy and ignores the active reception
of poetry taking place outside the academy, as though the latter were in some
way inconsequential." I think this priveleged reception is not my personal
misperception but a social fact for many people: alternative communities are
increasingly threatened by institutional co-option or extinction. Some of
these groups manage to survive by achieving a place in institutions, but at
the cost of having institutional mechanisms determine what they do.

If you've been reading Ron Silliman's blog spots, you'll know that he
criticized CHAIN magazine some weeks ago for having failed to create new,
admired, frequently read poets in the way that magazines of the 60s and 70s
did. As often with Ron, I think he puts his finger on the right problem and
then diagnoses it the wrong way. Let's leave aside the fact that Chain's
editorial policy works against the cult of the individual poet, instead
highlighting cultural questions and poetic techniques. But even if they did
have a cult of the individual poet there, I doubt that they would be able to
create such reputations. CHAIN, simply, doesn't have the power to do that. I
think in general the world of poetry, as separate from the academy, is losing
that power. The power lies elsewhere.

Let's take the case of Charles Bernstein, who as a poet, critic, and as a
person  I have huge admiration for, and who has done with his academic profile
endless numbers of great things, from my point of view. I used to think--and
still do, in a different way--isn't it cool that someone like Charles made an
inroad into the academy and opened up any number of possibilities there. But
now I think there's another element to the situation; if he hadn't entered the
academic world, there's no way that he could have done so many of the great
things he's done. He'd be an intriguing, brilliant, but much less central
figure. Charles is widely read not because he's an important thinker, not
because of his relationship to language writing, but because his perceived
power in the academic world makes him admired (and, of course, loathed). I'm
glad he's managed all those things, but I just think that outside of his
academic power, he couldn't have.

But still, maybe I'm being overly pessimistic, and the alternatives are alive
and well. I'd love to be convinced of it, because right now, they don't seem
that way to me. I think the threat of absolute institutional co-option is
growing rapidly. All the more reason, I'd say, Gary, to do the kind of work
you're doing, and insist that the alternatives still exist.

Hi all,

A question for ye: there seems to be a general consensus that the fact
that Don Allen's The New American Poetry 1945-1960 includes only a single
handful of women poets is a real failing of the book if not of Allen's.
My question is, which women poets do you think should have, could have,
been included at the time - i.e. who if anyone did Allen miss that would
have made sense right then and there.  DiPrima, for instance?  I know she
was fairly new to the scene when the anthology came out (or indeed, was
she not quite there yet, or *just* there as with Berkson?).  And I also
assume that poetic polarizations made someone like Plath unfeasible (so
that, while someone might argue that she *should* have been there, no one
could really argue that she *could* have under the circumstances, besides
which its a little early for her too).  Okay, speak.

-m.

Thanks Mark, for the great post. I just got it, unfortunately, after having
written what follows--so my asking, below, for you to elaborate on your
argument, is moot. And some of my own clarifications below are probably
unnecessary at this point. But, I gotta go back to work! I'll respond, Mark,
to your new post in a bit--I agree with a lot of what you say, actually,
especially that, yes, I'm in New York, where there's an awful lot of
activity, so my own thinking is skewed by that, and I do forget. (Thinking
back to the years I spent in Minneapolis, I remember being much less
optimistic about things.) Also, I want to think about this idea of the
"strong" poet--or maybe better put "more visible" poet & its relationship to
academic success.

But, since most of this really addresses Jeffrey's argument, which I think
was a different one from your own, & for whatever else it's worth, here's
what I had written:

Jeffrey, when you say:

"I don't want to be sneering or contemptuous of those consumers' rights to
read whatever pastimes they choose ... it's simply not at all the same
chemistry or universe as anything like that "poetic value"

you're dismissing, wholesale, the reception of poetry by readers of Aloud
and (many) similar anthologies. Let's look carefully at how you characterize
these "two groups" of people. First, that you break them up into two groups,
as though the two audiences were entirely separate. (I think there's
overlap, actually.) Having done that, you pitch the Norton readers as having
made a significant investment of time and money, having paid for college (as
though "spoken-word poets" stop at or in the middle of high-school), and
having made an investment in *studying* poetry--unlike, according to the
terms of your argument, Edwin Torres, Paul Beatty, Maggie Estep, Wanda
Phipps, Miguel Algarin, etc.? You pitch readers of Aloud as being, simply,
"consumers" for whom poetry is a (mere?) "pastime." It's not *quite*
sneering nor is it *quite* contemptuous. But it's certainly dismissive, not
to mention that it makes certain assumptions about the kinds of readers
either anthology is likely to have. I have no sense from your post that
anyone reading this anthology could possibly participate--even
unconsciously--in something so socially & otherwise complex as the creation
of poetic value. In your dismissal, you also neglect to bring up a further
complication--Aloud (and numerous similar anthologies) is, in fact, taught
at the college level, as part of the larger curriculum.

Posting the amazon.com figures was not a gesture meant to prove anything one
way or the other, nor was it particularly "Whitmanic." I simply want to
complicate--to add to--our understanding of the multiple sites involved in
the creation of poetic value.

Poetic value is being created, maintained, changed, navigated, and so on,
constantly, outside of a purely academic context. Some of it at a
non-academic institutional level: Coffee House Press, Rain Taxi, American
Book Review, the Poetry Project, the Loft, the Ohio Arts Council, NYFA,
Roof/Segue, Small Press Traffic, Small Press Distribution, etc. Some of it
at a corporate publishing level: the Village Voice, SF Weekly, the Times
Book Review, etc. Some of it at the corporate retail level: amazon.com,
Barnes & Noble, Borders, etc. Some of it at a more local, independent level:
reading series in various cities and towns, independent bookstores like
Woodland Pattern (which may actually be a non-profit, therefore an
institution, although I'm not sure) and Bridge Street Books, various reading
groups, single or co-edited magazine and book publishers everywhere (Potes &
Poets, Granary Books, Krupskaya, Faux, Pressed Wafer, Situations, Edge, on &
on). Some of it is at the (for want of a better term) the independent Web
level: arras.net, jacket, theeastvillage, Readme, duration, Shampoo, Vert,
etc.

That many of the people involved in the hundreds of various projects listed
or alluded to in the paragraph above spent some time in a college or
university is inarguable, and like everything else in one's experience, is
accountable (if not exactly quantifiable). It may speak of *prior* academic
hegemony.

But, unless I'm completely wrong, it sounded like what Mark was talking
about is not the *prior* hegemony of the academy, but the *increasing
hegemony of academic production*--which I think is a very different
argument. More specific, and I think crucial to his argument: Mark suggested
that writers like Rod Smith, Buck Downs, and Heather Fuller are in
increasing danger of being overlooked, forgotten. He says that
"increasingly, academic success=poetic value" and that "Non-academic poets
are second rate citizens at best, if they're allowed any cache as citizens
at all." It's an interesting argument, and it's obviously something to be
concerned about. And it may be true, generally, *within the academy*.

But, I do have to admit, it does seem to run counter to my own experience
*outside* of the academy. Non-academic poets, or poets who have had little
or no academic success, are not second rate citizens at all. And some very
successful academics who are poets publishing and otherwise creating outside
of the academy don't seem to be particularly valued (people, I should say,
whose work I personally love). Because I don't generally see an increasing
preference for successful academics in the various sites of reception that I
frequent (online, in person, or on the page), I wasn't sure how Mark made
that leap--which was why I asked if he might unpack what he means by the
"increasing hegemony of academic production."

[Obviously now I *do* see how Mark made that leap, having just read his
latest post--but will have to come back to this a bit later ...]

Hmm.  Mightn't the problem have been not so much Allen and his book per se,
but the masculinist bent of the entire open form/beat/otherwise experimental
scene of midcentury?  That it was just not a woman-friendly creative
climate, and thus the book reflects that imbalance?  Seems like it wasn't
until the late sixties at least that women really felt empowered to
participate in greater numbers....

It was definitely too early for Plath.  Adrienne Rich was still doing formal
quatrains and such....

I was just thinking in the last hour about women poets of the sixties and
seventies who did fascinating work but who don't get a lot of attention from
our neck of the poetics woods, for various ideological / stylistic /
no-real-good reasons ... Diane Wakoski, Alta, etc....

Like Ai, for example.  What do people think of Ai?  On the one hand, she's
kind of submerged in that whole MFA summer-workshop in the foothills world,
and her textual approach is very discursively "familiarized" and all, but
then she's got that "confessional from the point of view of the Other" thing
going on with all that scary ugly shocking violent cut-you-up-muthafucker
stuff and so on that always struck me as challenging and original.
Especially in her earlier work, maybe.

K.

DiPrima's recent autobiography tells what she heard about why she wasn't
included in the Allen anthology -- not pleasant reading . . . .

Hi Mike,

Alan Golding's done a much more thorough job than I, but looking through
the New American Poetry papers at UCSD Rare Books Collection, it seems
there was a very real possibility that Joanne Kyger might have been
included in the original 1960 NAP=2E  (Perhaps her being overseas at the
final count had something to do with her being left out--I can't recall
right now=2E)

There were as well an additional number of strong female writers on the Sa=
n
Francisco scene at the time =2E =2E =2E  as well as nationally =2E =2E =2E=
  Jack
Spicer's and Fran Herndon's "J" magazine printed some, Don Allen must have=

known at least some of this work, but as far as I know none of them missed=

the brass ring as bitingly closely as Kyger=2E

xxx Kevin K=2E

where is the sting?

one of the strings that seems to tie many of these periodic elist furies
here together is the question of poetic hegemony, I think.  and I think many
of them miss the essential problem or at least write around it or them.

in the US and on the US-dominated internet, money is the engine.

too often the poetry world seems to follow world seems to mirror this to the
detriment of it's institutions (anti as well as academic).  when i look for
a book or mag or course on poetry or poetics I am looking for how to read or
write or to enjoy the sport or game.

i think the world series as it's shown on TV these days is an apt analogy?
I don't watch for the stats they flash
or the brands they they toss out
or the garrulous Garrodgiolawannabes

but the action I recall of swinging and striking or striking out
or in more arm-chair fashion recalling Stan gallumping forth to swat or not.

Mark,

Unlike Gary, I would have to say that your post leaves me more confused.
I'm not confused about your argument or your thinking, which you've made
very clear; what confuses me is where you want to go with that argument.
Are you only posting because, as you suggest at the end, you'd love to be
convinced that your argument is wrong, that the situation isn't as bad as
all that?  Or if not, why make the argument, if not to suggest that
something can be done about it?  Yet your argument stops short of what, I
feel, would be its implicit conclusion: a call to action.  One can argue--
though I'm not saying that *you* would, Mark-- that nothing any of us can do
would make a difference, but that argument itself flies in the face of the
activist poetic tradition to which we subscribe.

I realize that you & many others on this list have done many things to make
the inside/outside distinction less of a marker of cultural "value," so I
don't want this to sound in any way like a criticism-- but Mark, you're a
teacher, critic & editor, and you're talking to a list consisting of a lot
of other teachers, critics, editors, publishers, MOST of whom (I'd wager)
sympathize with your desire to break down that distinction, regardless of
which side they'd take on the endlessly recycled academic/anti-academic
debate on this list.  Shit, if (for example) HALF the people on this list
reviewed one book in the next year by a poet not working in academia; if
HALF the people here who teach included one (more) poet outside of academia
in their course reading materials; if just ONE THIRD of the editors &
publishers on this list published one (more) book by a poet outside
academia-- don't you think that would make a difference?  No it wouldn't be
a cure-all-- but wouldn't it make a difference?

Then again, in some ways your post suggests that things may not really be as
bad as all that.  While I agree that Bernstein probably wouldn't be as
visible if he hadn't made it into academia, he would be a whole lot less
visible, whether in or out of academia, if he weren't such an articulate
spokesperson for alternative poetries.  On the other hand, you mention Ron
Silliman, who has worked outside academia his whole life, & (except for
never having appeared in any bad Sean Connery movies) is doing pretty well.
And Chain, which you also mention, is an interesting example of the
inside/outside lines being blurred: though published without institutional
support, its editors are both pretty successful younger academics.  So, I
guess one question we could ask is where & how do we draw these lines.  I'm
not always sure myself.

Could anyone comment on literary situations outside the U.S. and Canada?

In Europe, so I'm told, academic careers are rare, government funding is strong, and there is a tradition of writers/intellectuals contributing to newspapers, the feuilleton, etc.

What about Japan or Taiwan?  What about India?  I thought there were at least a few list members residing in Asia...

Personally, I am interested in the places that seem the most _unlike_ the U.S.

The Poetics List may be necessarily U.S.-centric, but maybe someone could provide a little information about other nations.  This would, I think, enrich the sociology we are presently doing.

Hi all, thanks for the thoughts on this little thread I started.  Here are
three more names Bill Berkson gave me a while back as part of a list of
poets associated with Greenwich Village in the 50s:

Daisy Aldan - her poems in FOLDER (which she edited) are pretty
interesting, she certainly wouldn't have seemed out of place in Allen's
NAP.

Ruth Yorck
Barbara Moraff (had book with Totem/Corinth)(a.k.a. Barbara Ellen)

Berkson or some other informed person would have to speak to the work of
these last two as I don't know it.

Come to think of it, Bunny Lang also has poems in FOLDER.

mark, gary, catherine, andrew, aldon, jeffrey, maria, others,

one of the problems right off has to do with the way "poetry" is
being segmented in contradistinction e.g. to prose...  we *could*
say, for all intents and purposes, that exp. prose is treated much
the same as poetry, and therefore enjoys the same problematic
relationship with academe...

i mean, i *could* say that, as an academic, i find mself fighting
against certain academic realities/strictures/discourses in order to
continue to produce work that is not easily classifiable (i don't
wish to suggest that i get up in the morning with a 'defy
classification' agenda as a poet---i'm talking about the way i hope
my work might be rec'd ex post facto, whatever i bring to it
initially)...

but the fact is, i don't just write poetry---and lots of poets i know
don't just write poetry... they write criticism, reviews,
scholarship---and perhaps screenplays and jello ad copy... one of the
problems here is that some of these pursuits seem to pull one farther
out of academic considerations, yet into equally overdetermined
marketplaces (screenwriting and its associated business, even at this
early stage in my aspiring such career, seems mighty hard to square
with the academic and academic publishing bureaucracy)...

so there's this question, then, of writing practices, which don't
reduce easily either to genre or to "author" (as authors are, as i
know them, multifaceted)...

but there's a deeper, more embracing problem raised by this question
of what's happening to poetry outside of academe (to presume a
clearcut outside, as again, i'm more for looking at the way ALL of
education, k-12, speaks to such outsides)... it has to do with the
level of analysis we wish to embark upon, and ultimately becomes a
matter (broadly) of intellectual history... as in, the history of
intellectuals (!)...

i can't do justice to these concerns here... but one article i read
recently comes immediately to mind... i found a copy of ~the
chronicle [of higher ed] review~ (4 oct.) lying in front of our
faculty mailboxes the other day (note how overdetermined *this*
little scenario is!), and snatched it up to read john lukacs's "the
obsolescence of the american intellectual"... while lukacs says some
things with which i stridently disagree (and which border to me on
fogeyisms of one sort or the other), his brief survey of intellectual
presence in the u.s. public sphere of the 20th century is worth
reading, and leads him to discuss the disappearance, not of the
public, but of what he calls "the private intellectual"---"a person
with a mind of his or her own"... and which leads him to posit "The
Reader" as perhaps the private intellectual's cultural replacement...

but in any case i can't see as how we can discuss problems of poetry
outside academe without a more thorough (sociological?  historical?
economic?) consideration of cultural-intellectual deformations of the
past half century... and in any case i tend to like to think in terms
of what we do to eat (e.g.) while we produce our poetry, and where we
do it (teaching incl.)---as opposed to the somewhat more precious
suggestion (not that anyone hereabouts has suggested so, exactly)
that such considerations are somehow beneath a more rigorous
examination of formal possibilities as these intersect with the
reception sphere...

best,

joe

Ah, yes, Daisy Aldan was a dedicated publisher of poetry.  My first two books
of poems were published by Daisy in Folder Editions, namely, AN EYE FOR AN I
and I WANTED TO SEE SOMETHING FLYING.

And now, may I add, still with small presses, I have just published with
Marsh Hawk Press, a book of poems called DRAWING ON THE WALL. I will be
reading from it on November 6 (6 to 8 pm) at the Cornelia STreet Cafe (29
Cornelia STreet, NYC) and on November 10 (5 to 7 pm)at the Tribes Gallery
(285 East 3rd Street, NYC)

Good subject.

But Plath? She was the darling of the academic poets and the young
women who had conventional dreams. we knew that she represented the
other side, where Robert Lowell and Ted Hughs had set up camp.

These are self-help books, though some do verge on "applied" reference
material and crit lite.

I have read in the palm of your hand and mary oliver's book, and just
about every silly how to write or how to write poetry book there is --
fussel, hollander, ciardi, poemcrazy, writing down the bones, bird by
bird, the writing life, the artists way -- my students seem to insist on
it.  I try to treat it like having to scan yucky not-about-business
books like how to negotiate anything or dale carnegie or toastmasters,
but, in fact, it just makes me mean.

How many gifts of Rumi-related items have you received from students,
family members, well-meaning friends?  What did you write in the thank
you notes?

Catherine,

I hope you're not including Kenneth Koch's _Making Your Own Days_ in this
mini-rant. I used it in  a class this spring, and it was in no wise a
"how-to" book; it's part anthology, part Kochian wisdom, all very great.  I
agree that most "You too can write poems" books make "real" poets grumpy,
but Koch's is not among those.  Take a look at it.  Use it in your
workshop.

p.s. Why am I still receiving emails from this list?  I tried to

p.p.s.  If anyone who was too shy to call me on my telephone wants to hear
my voice (it's very sexy), you can hear me read a poem on NPR's "Here and
Now" tomorrow at noon EST.  Well, the show begins at noon, but the poetry
segment (feature "roving poet" Jim Behrle) is near the end of the show.
(Correct me if I'm wrong, Jim.)  If your NPR doesn't get this show, you can

I like Ai very much, yes, Kasey me too, especially her earlier work.

I saw her read in Boston, at T.T. the Bear's, no less, about 12 years ago or
more, somewhere right before her book FATE.  I must say that there is
nothing like hearing her read.  She comes off very monotone, almost in
newscaster diction, but quietly, and you must listen, for within those
eerily on-point monologues is the most incredible internal rhyme scheme,
just as understated and stealthy as can be.

I like the idea of her with lots of cats.  A kind of Leonor Fini of poetry.

What intrigued me, though, was her dedicating FATE to Willem Defoe.  I think
they had some connection back in the Wooster Group days, or else I'm
spinning a shiny one here.

Lorine Niedecker, Helen Adam, Allison Knowles?

Ditto on the Koch book, o Aaron of the sexy voice -- it's
on the same shelf in Barnes & Noble as Oliver, Pinsky (not
that terrible, actually), Hirsch (yech), and all those
other books about how poetry is a spirit dance for your
inner iron john or johanna, but it's just exactly the
opposite thing: a non-condescending, down-to-earth
introduction/invitation, on par with his great books about
teaching poetry to children.

The Flame-throwers and Virginia




All matters reviewed and considered, deeply considered


there was no choice only the distinctive option:


Choose & choose quickly: miracles occur in threes

heralded by ravens The rooks overlook the pawns, the bell

& the book The flame throwers aware the hour and an unkindness of crows

approaching dawn and apportioned one flame, each for a specified =
indictment



Virginia not at all disinterested, the interested

party proceeded to reform and form the intangible



Oh, touch her not!



Not her heart. Just polish the remaining. Shards will not

provoke you, You! One stated on oath that the polarised lie was white.


the Other claimed quite a different colour. Oath again.

another radiant surface reveals nothing more than her shield

reflecting all the visible rays & from every angle
poised.



Now is the time for your pre-war gratification.
Do not bury your thoughts in the sand, Virginia!



Though in league with (no)one. But one whose stones

lay heavy. the Ones that follow are Lapis Lazuli=20

and Amber at her feet.



Your hand holds the flame.=20


Your hand holds the flame.

Your hand holds the flame.


Virginia was no lady and the lady was no: you-know
and had no, none to speak of, charm.

The snake she wore around her neck was but for decoration,=20
the jewels from the Count given away long ago. Oh, please.

The vieux chapeau is not so trivial as lies. Damned lies.

It never was a marriage of convenience,=20
the inconvenience of it all:


trifling with the servants,=20
the pretty maids all in a=20

row

complaining of the courtly though churning advances of=20

the Count, notches burning advancing blindly upward on his


thigh, Bone.=20
seeking fresh

advantages

They were but slaves.

Virginia, rent the garments of velvet
Pride blossomed in embroidered tatters,=20

and in place


a priori

et a fortiori
to the fall.=20

Uncouth!
Unjust!=20
Unjust!



Oh, just a minute, now=20
or Just was/not up to it.

The lawyers: fools and knaves!
The navy decommissioned!

Oh, mend her ways! She wends her way swiftly,

the eagle simply cannot compare.

The secrecy & oaths, the pact and vows,=20
as between arsonists, sworn.=20

Ransom was high.=20
Her captain was:


Courageous.


Virginia!

Prisoner!

The title of the Wieners poem was

"A poem for        suckers"

Send me the star...

But if you live in SF, you can go look at the Polk-Sutter Apartments at that

Dear Mike,

The late great May Swenson, who seems to sustain a genius for being
excluded from anthologies.  The late great Gwendolyn Brooks.  And on the
subject of Plath, which I am very reluctant to broach, George Bowering
writes:

"But Plath? She was the darling of the academic poets and the young
women who had conventional dreams. we knew that she represented the
other side, where Robert Lowell and Ted Hughs had set up camp."

In what sense did contemporary reviews of Plath's work convey her
darlingness?  Reviews of The Colossus seem condescending and sexist to
me.  In what sense was Plath the darling of "the young women who had
conventional dreams"?  Who were these women?  In what way did their
conventional dreams impact on editors? What's the 'other side'?  Plath
broke convention and was a major contributor to the establishment of new
subject matter in lyric poetry in English ("Three Women," which may or
may not be lyric, is the first poem in English, which I know of, which
includes a live female infant).  I'll be very happy to know of others,
of course.

Good subject.

But Plath? She was the darling of the academic poets and the young
women who had conventional dreams. we knew that she represented the
other side, where Robert Lowell and Ted Hughs had set up camp.

(Hanging Loose, 1998). On his New & Selected Poems Publishers Weekly writes=
:
"As brave, conceptual and big-minded as Jack Spicer=B9s lifetime of conferenc=
e
calls with the underworld, North=B9s work constantly greets us with the deft
presence of a mind devilishly enamored of improbable form and substantial
ideation. This 30-year retrospective is a genuine poetic find."

      "...the Franks did nothing evil to [the women]
       except pierce their bellies with their lances."

             - Chronicler Fulcher of Chartres following
           the Crusaders' slaughter of Moslem women outside
           the walls of Antioch

      "It was a just and marvelous judgment of God, that
      [the temple of Solomon] should be filled with the
      blood of the unbelievers."

             - Chronicler Raymond of Aguilers on the
             Crusaders' conquest of Jerusalem

     "It is though the sword automatically performs its
     function of justice, which is the function of mercy....
     The swordsman turns into an artist of the first
     grade, engaged in producing a work of genuine
     originality."

             - DT Suzuki on Zen and swordsmanship, written
            during the Japanese Rape of Nanking, during
            which 350,000 Chinese were slaughtered, and
            80,000 women were raped, many of whom were
            disemboweled.

     "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah
     and His apostle and strive to make mischief in the
     land is only this, that they should be murdered or
     crucified or their hands and their feet should be
     cut off on opposite sides or they should be
     imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in
     this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a
     grievous chastisement...."

             Maara

      "If ordered to march: tramp, tramp or shoot: bang,
      bang. This is the manifestation of the highest
      wisdom of enlightenment. The unity of Zen and war ...
      extends to the farthest reaches of the holy war now
      under way."

             - Zen Master Harada Daiun Sogaku, 1939

     "I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of
     gas. I am strongly in favour of using poison gas
     against uncivilised tribes."

            and they asked how to tell the faithful apart
            from the infidels

      "So they put them to flight by Allah's permission. And
      Dawood slew Jalut, and Allah gave him kingdom and wisdom,
      and taught him of what He pleased. And were it not for
      Allah's repelling some men with others, the earth would

            in God



                       God
is that which
does not exist.
In order to bring
                       God
into your life,
you must know that
                       He
does not exist.
In order to bring
                       God
into your life,
you must create that
which does not exist.

That is, you must be
the
                       God
of
                       God
by creating
                       God
in your own
imagination.
You must invent
                       God
and believe in your
invention.
                       God
is bringing that
which does not exist
into existence.  So
know that
                       God
does not exist,
but believe
                       Him
into the world
and create, create,
create, create.
                       God
is that which
does not exist,
                       He
is the negation of
all things that are,
and you must believe
in the negation of
all things, and in
so doing bring
                       Him
into the world.
Because you know
                       He
doesn't exist, and
because you want
the world to become
that which does not
exist and you want
to believe believe
believe. And then
you will kill
                       God
and become the
negation of all
negation and enter
into the light of
pure affirmation.
                       Who am

bloody cross,
all men. Pledge
your irrevocable
engagement.
                       God

never stops bleeding.
All men.  In mysteries
men soon do lose
their way.  Hold fast
and watch me come. My
hands are tied but my
arms are open. They
are bleeding for you.
In the end is the

for the end is when
the flesh profane
is made
                       Word
in flame.  All men.

BOBBIE LOUISE HAWKINS
NEW One-Person Evening: ONE NIGHT ONLY
LIFE AS WE KNOW IT
Joe=B9s Pub
425 Lafayette St.
New York City
Monday, October 14, 2002
Performance will be at 9:30 pm
Tickets $10 at the door.
Information 212-539-8778



WHAT THE PRESS HAS SAID ABOUT HAWKINS:

NEW YORK TIMES
...sharp as splinters ...devastating and ironic ...
...beguiling, witty, and occasionally militant ...

ROLLING STONE
=B3Her prose is vivid, tinged with sarcasm
and wisdom . . . A writer with a
distinctive and memorable style.=B2

BOSTON SOJOURNER
=B3. . . a composite of experiences
causing an introspective look into one=B9s
own existence . . . A standing ovation
when the performance was concluded.=B2

TOLEDO - THE COLLEGIAN
=B3Her ear is exact- the dialogue is
sharp as splinters, as devastating and
ironic as any dialogue set down by
Raymond Carver or Ann Beattie.=B2

TORONTO GLOBE & MAIL
=B3Hawkins punctuates her stories with
laugh-provoking one-liners, but much of
the humor comes from the faithful
observation of character and the plausi-ble
rendering of circumstance.=B2

THE SAN DIEGO UNION
=B3Hawkins is keenly aware of the
complicated vastness of even just one
little human universe. Her sentences do
not meet that universe head on but at a
=8Cslight angle=B9.

Hawkins=B9 writing participates in a
tradition of American Modernism in
prose that sometimes achieves an
almost hallucinatory precision. A
thoughtful artist=B9s eye informs the writ-ing.=B2

THE VAJRADHATU SUN
=B3She excels at the short take, the
oblique view, and the sort of incident
that allows the storyteller leeway to
expand, change and alter the fundamental
nugget of actuality.
Her curious, witty and occasionally
militant slants make her writing unclassifiable
but altogether beguiling.=B2

L.A. TIMES BOOK REVIEW
=B3Hawkins moves with apparent ease
from tale to tale, suffusing each with
irony, anger or love as the occasion
demands. Pieces of varying length are
juxtaposed and, once fit together, the
life of a woman emerges.=B2

PUBLISHERS WEEKLY
=B3Hawkins, a splendidly handsome
figure, is a poet and writer of poetic
prose. In a voice as beautiful and senstive
as a grand opera diva or the grandest
of jazz singers, she reads from her
works.
She is a priceless artist who captures
in every line a past that becomes a slice
of American social history.=B2

SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER
=B3Miss Hawkins is a superb impressionist
as well as a salty prose writer of
American miniatures, artful distillations
of our humor and humanity.=B2

Welll little poems in prose sounds like a direct translation of Baudelaire's
"Petits Poemes en Prose"  --- but his are more than 3 lines lone, more like
a paragraph.  They are rather nice.

Speaking of prose poems, has anyone seen the journal "The Styles"?  I just
bought it because its graphic design drew me in, and some of it is
wonderful.  Some of it is a little schlocky.  It doesn't seem to feature
especially well-known poets/writers -- I am hoping I could get in it some
day (it has extensive (for a poetry magazine) bios in tiny type where people
talk about weird revealing things, which are almost prose poems themselves.
I don't know if you can get a poem published if you have a boring bio.  And
it has a page of blank, lined paper at the end which says "We welcome
submissions.  Please use our paper if you like."  Many of the works are
prose poems.  Most of the stories are sort of prose poems.  A few things are
poems or stories proper.  It's pretty short for a journal.

[insert the why can't I ever manage to get published lament.  then add the
because, you fool, you don't submit often enough.  people who get published
submit a lot of work.  than add the, no, I doubt it, I think they are just
so lucky/brilliant/well-connected that everything they submit gets accepted.
now meow.  jealously.  say at least if I am not published in print poetry
except for a few times in the Buffalo News, I will never have to give my
profession as, "poet" and have people either fawn over me or avoid me like
an anthrax spore.  saying I do web work sounds more cool.  until they find
out it's unpaid.  and involves -- gasp! -- art and poetry.  it isn't is if I
am one of those cool people who design obnoxious banner ads saying click
here you have won a pink polka-dotted VW bug if you come take delivery of it
in Topeka, Kansas in the next 24 hours by buying your ticket on ValuJet.
And a ticket for the Bug.  plus pay the overweight fee on it and submit to
all sorts of hassles while they search its nooks and crannies for explosives
which they might find since this is perhaps not an ad for ValuJet but a
ploy, a sinister trick perpetrated by Hamas or Al-Qaeda to trap the evil
American through his own greed and stupidity and blow him up along with
several hunderd other innocents and their cars which they are idiotically
trying to transport by airplane.  No, I do not write banner ads for
Al-Qaeda.  Not that they have approached me and that I have turned them
down. You see I am hard up for cash and if they paid cash _ahead of time_ (I
don't accept web design fees in the afterlife, with all the virgins at my
feet and hopefully at more than my feet or I would be sorely disappointed
but you know all the virgins, well, screwing me, but really you know who
wants to be screwed by a virgin? they have no technique and tend to squeal
or if male just squirt and go to sleep with little before or afterplay; what
fun is that?  anyway, I don't accept sexual favors in the afterlife or even
the pure sight of Allah the magnificent as payment for web design.)  I'd
need cold hard cash.  So if a putative Islamic terrorist organization were
to come to be to ask for a banner ad and the price were right, I might
consider it, but the attendant risks are great here in this country where
there is no more free speech...  so better be a web artist, than a mouse for
hire lest the wrong people hire you.  Of course my art itself could be
objectionalble to georgie porgie, donald rumface and all the rest of the
cabinet of fools who run this country in my name -- after all, I might use
their name in vain -- the Germans did and now they are the bad guys, so much
so that we have abandoned all pretext of having an Alliance with France and
Germany (England's ok, Tony's wrapped around George's little finger, for
some reasona I've never fathomed.  Maybe he likes to fish at Kennebunkport)
so anyway, I might run awry of one of these great men or women (condoleeza's
quite a gal -- where'd they find such a fascist Black girl?  Somewhere in
the vicinity of that strange place they got Clarence Thomas from, no doubt:
affirmative action is good for me but bad for anybody else... and I do say
"girl," not woman for she does what big daddy Bush tells her to and
Republicans call all women of color "girl" unless they are on welfare, in
which case they call them "slut" for doing in bed at night what everyone
else either does in bed at night or wants to unless it is their job in which
case they probably want to curl up with a teddy bear after a nice bath and
watch re-runs of I Love Lucy while dreaming of a job as a waitress or
secretary.  so I'm supposed to be a web artist, another way to say I'm
unemployed, zipppo money, no damn luck, a real hard case, my ass is hanging
in the wind.  I sell cards I make as spinoff from my projects (my god! how
low!) -- cutesy elephants in harbors covered with buoys like the facade of a
seafood restaurant I saw.  Dogs riding giant fish (stuffed of course, but I
took off the back plate for the picture) while eating smaller versions,
rainbow fish with bull's eyes for eyes lounging on the dunes, giant metal
sculptures of mechanical men, walking on water, towards the beach-- they
have landed, they are coming, they will get us.  One is reading a big black
book.  Is it a bible?  Is it a manual in arabic for blowing up cabanas?  Is
it the constitution of the United States, which he has duly studied, line by
line, like any immigrant to our great land should.  If so he'll form a
strange idea that in our country freedom reigns, that power is checked, that
war is declared, that leaders are elected, that we the people rule.  He'll
think we can say what we want to say where we want to say it with as many
like minded people as we want.  He won't know about the waiting paddy-buses,
which contrary to the sound of the words, aren't padded, in fact have no
seats in some cases, you are just stuffed in after being maced and for God
sakes don't resist because attacking a police officer is a federal offence
worthy of years and years of jail during which you must make license plates
so that American cars can pollute the atmosphere and disobey the Kyoto
treaty and commit vehicular manslaughter and drive drunk and make it so
little johnny isn't safe to play outside or cross the street to Jennifer's
house, yes, you can make license plates, and don't attempt to personalize
with little messages like "wear your seatbelt or you might be in jail for
the next 25 years if you are in California" or "one joint is the same as one
murder: doesn't murder sound more fun?  It doesn't cause health problems and
improves your self-esteem wheras marijuana leads to an amotivational
syndrome and a lack of self-actualization which can be quite harmful.  So
the next time you start to roll a joint, think: why don't I kill my high
school biology teacher instead?  It would rid so many children of suffering"
If you do this you will lose your work priveleges that is you will no longer
get 60 cents a day which means ytou won't have any money to pay off the guy
who is protecting you from the guy who wants to rape you so I hope you are
not too tight back there or you will be sorry.  But don't complain to the
guard if it hurts because he knows that after a while anal sex does not hurt
therefore he will gladly offer you more experience so as to diminish your
pain.  And don't complain to the press that the guard is a rapist because
when YOU get charged with raping a guard it will be for life and ther WILL
be witnesses even though you were not on top they'll say they couldn't tell
(as if they were such prudes that they either weren't looking or actually
did not have the visual discrimination to determine whose prick pricked
whom) why you may ask are you in jail?  I admit that as I write this I had
forgot but that is because you have been locked up so long that everyone but
you has forgotten but you know it's becuase you stood on a beach and said
"Fuck the USA!" and then were maced and grabbed and dragged backwards by
your feet into a waiting paddy wagon off to jail on suspected terrorism
charges.  Yoou of course meant no harm.  You thought you were being
Whitmanesque.  Your english is literary but not colloquial, and you were
imagining loving the whole country, the country of your asylum, where you
have finally arrived, you were saying that you love it, and the greatest
love is the love that  man can do to a woman, in this case the woman being
mother earth, Mother America (you don't realize that we have no such
effeminate notion of our country.  We are much more of a Fatherland like
Nazi Germany), so you wanted to love, make love to, screw, fornicate with,
and finally FUCK AMERICA.  And in joyous but accented terms you said so.
And no one knows your plight.  You haven't been charged.  You are not
entitled to a lawyer.  You can be held indefinitely. And when you are
relaeased, a kindly judge, who also was an immigrant, a Jewish immigrant
from after the War who also read Whitman, will tell you how sorry he is.  He
will say that a great injustice has been foisted upon you.  But that the law
of the land, the law of Bush's land, requires that you be immediately
deported even though you were found innocent of all crimes.  And you
camnnnot attempt to enter the United States (as if you's want to now!) for
five years or be subject to criminal prosecution under the Homeland Security
Act.  Ah the joys of being an immigrant.  I fortnately, am a native born
American and share the guilt rather than the pain for all the injustice
practuced here.  It is not that we are the worst country.  Even I prefer it
here to -- dare I say it -- Iraq.  But we are getting worse at an alarming
pace.  And I, a web worker with no income except for government disability,
am in the firing line.  Once, when democrats ruled, I was someone with a
disability, someone to be protected, nurtured, and helped back to work if I
chose.  Now I am rather someone to be resented, someone who costs society
rather than someone who brings in the dough (despite the cultural capital I
produce), someone who would be better off dead, or at least off the
disability rolls so loing as I was not in any facility that cost money to
keep up but also did not become an eyesore in the street.  Moreover, with
all the strange crime (not done by crazy people), it is getting dangerous to
be crazy.  Will we be made to register when we move in to a neighborhood in
case we rape young children?  Will we be denied the right to vote, to serve
on juries, to become lawyers, judges, politicians?  We already are, but with
Papa Bush it will get worse.  Ronald Reagan, for all his hatefulness, was a
loving conservative.  He never loved my people, the poor and disabled,  but
he was warm.  Bush is a hating conservative.  He uses words like "evil."  I
think the concept of evil is best left to theologians.  I am afraid of being
designated as evil (perhaps my codition is a punishment for something bad I
did like NEVER ONCE pledge allegiance to the flag once I know what all the
words meant.  I wasn't going to bow down to a piece of cloth.  My father had
already read me about the golden calf in the Bible, and this seemed similar.
And if it meant bowing down to the COUNTRY , that was even worse.  All the
heroes I had been taught to revere had fought the country: Harriet Tubman,
Martin Luther King, Che Guevara (I was white but in a black school).  How
long until they come for me?  Since I am taking my anti-paranoia pills like
a good girl, I have to conclude that my fear is realistic...  So maybe it's
better not to make waves by getting my name in print...]

Hi all,

I'm wondering if any one knows how to get in touch with Quincy Troupe?
I've looked at the UCSD site and his e-mail isn't listed with the
literature department.

I'm working on an article on Hugh Masekela and I believe that Troupe is
working on a biography. I want to ask him about it.

Also, I know that some of you out there know a tonne about music so any
help with my Masekela project would also be appreciated.

thanks,
kevin H.

Just to complicate somewhat the categorizing going on below. (1) Teaching
from the published archive only. And (2) the rise of localism.
I've been teaching contemporary American poetry in distant NZ. I order the
books for the university library relevant to my teaching and  order more
small press publications than university press or mainline publishers. I
also order audio and video tapes or CDs, and when we manage to get poets out
here we put them in the studio and record them. Almost the poets we teach we
have on either audio or video, and these are available to students in the
audio-visual library. Of course,the epc which is an indispensable teaching
resource, provides valuable soken word performance material.

the 'slam' reading and web poetry were preceded by spoken word performance
poetry in the 60s and 70s, and something else before that and that spoken
word poetry is different from published poetry and has qualities of its own
and not judge it by print published poetry standards. after all print
published poetry is the currency of academia, the saleable commodity for
publishers, editors, book sellers etc. and has little interest in poetry in
other media.

the thing is poetry is a local activity and an academic study.
in the local activity performance is equally as important if not more
important than publication. but when academics try to see the 'big picture'
to define national poetries, there is only the published archive to study.
in the past this has meant the setting up of canons, based on the published
archive. lately people have been more interested in seeing poetry not only
within literature but  the culture in which it exists in as well.

poetry has become a global activity and the major publishers have declared
it is no longer financially viable to publish poetry, that there isn't a
large enough reading audience to publish individual collections of
contemporary poets. this has made publication a more localized activity
again as in the 1970s and 1980s with the flourishing of small presses and
of course the on-line poetry journals, zines, and digital poetries, which
highlight localized activity to a global audience.

no matter how hard the academy tries to control the agenda of poetry it
can't, and i believe, probably stopped trying to in the mid 1980s. the
local activity of poetry has a much greater effect on people's lives
directly.
the discussion about baraka on this list lately is a prime example.

what i see we have today is lots of different localized activities of
poetry all over the world, not necessarily having style as a common
interest, but thematically linked, the ethno-poets, the eco-poets, the
gender-poets, the theory-poets, the digital-poets, the code-poets, the
left-poets, the cowboy-poets, the bush-poets, as well as physically
localized groups around cities and towns, buffalo-poets, albany-poets, the
toronto poets, melbourne anarchist poets, sydney poets union poets,
subvoicive poets in the uk, etc etc etc. it would be impossible to list all
the localized groups of poetic activity.

even the university presses are no longer considering the publication of
poetry as a priority. this will have a devastating effect on academics who
in the past have been able to ensure their tenure with a healthy
publication record.

well which ever way you take your poetry, you have to enjoy what you are
doing i suppose. i enjoy experimenting with digital poetry, talking about
poetic culture on this list and organizing and participating in a monthly
spoken word poetry event at my local arts co-operative at the gold coast.

Interesting question. On a related tangent, Ron Silliman recently posted on
his blog a few words by Weinberger, in which W. wonders "whether we're not
all prisoners of the Don Allen taxonomy." He points out that Allen neglects
not only women poets, but poets of the "sort-of generation" between Black
Mountain and the Objectivists--Rexroth, Rukeyser, Patchen, etc. Even points
out that Lowell in the early 50's considered himself a Poundian--quite
different from our conception of him. Many more interesting tidbits and
questions--check out http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/, if you haven't
already. Are we due for a New American Poetry Redux?

Hi all,

A question for ye: there seems to be a general consensus that the fact
that Don Allen's The New American Poetry 1945-1960 includes only a single
handful of women poets is a real failing of the book if not of Allen's.
My question is, which women poets do you think should have, could have,
been included at the time - i.e. who if anyone did Allen miss that would
have made sense right then and there.  DiPrima, for instance?  I know she
was fairly new to the scene when the anthology came out (or indeed, was
she not quite there yet, or *just* there as with Berkson?).  And I also
assume that poetic polarizations made someone like Plath unfeasible (so
that, while someone might argue that she *should* have been there, no one
could really argue that she *could* have under the circumstances, besides
which its a little early for her too).  Okay, speak.

-m.

Thanks again for the post, Mark. I reread it a couple of times, and see that
there's an emphasis on venues for poetics as one indication (among others)
of what you're describing. I guess that's a tough call. I don't really know
what options existed in the past for non-academic books of
poetics/criticism. Post-WWII, I can only think of a few before the 80s: New
Directions, Black Sparrow, maybe Four Seasons? Mostly it seemed like that
stuff appearedin magazines. Were there non-academic presses in the 50s, 60s,
70s and/or 80s doing a lot of poetics or criticism books? Ecco, maybe? Who
was it that published A Quick Graph? Roof has done a few, yeah. But it seems
like the options for non-academic poetics or criticism books might not ever
have been very great. (I might be just drawing a blank.)

There aren't a lot of options entirely outside of an academic context right
now, true, but I took you up on your call & tried to think of some
more-or-less recent things to add to the list. Tod Thilleman's Spuyten
Duyvil has published a couple of recent things: Chris Stroffolino's Spin
Cycle and David Rosenberg's See What You Think: Critical Essays for the Next
Avant Garde. Talisman just published that big book of essays. I think Brian
Kim Stefans has a book on digital poetics (& other things) coming out from
Atelos. It's true that Sun & Moon is gone, but Green Integer is doing
occasional books of poetics. Eileen Tabios did that great book, Black
Lightning, which was published by Asian-American Writer's Workshop, though
it is true it's being distributed by Temple U. She also did Jose Garcia
Villa's selected, published by Kaya, which includes a number of essays, as
well as co-editing Babaylan, an anthology of about 60 Filipina &
Filipina-American writers, published by Aunt Lute. There's also My Romance,
a book of arts-essays she did, published by Giraffe Books, which I think is
in the Philippines. People also sometimes include that stuff in their books
of poetry--Eileen Myles' Not Me, I think, and On My Way both have poetics
essays in the back. It's something I'd like to see more of, actually.

Most of the non-academic poetics/criticism activity seems to be in
magazines, newspapers & newsletters, and increasingly on the web. Not just
in webzines, but now, for instance, yeah, you mentioned Silliman's blog,
which I do read. Plus Brian's, Jonathan's, Brandon's, and I think there are
others--not that many, but it seems to have just started to catch on as
another possible site, though Alan Sondheim has been doing a kind of poetics
blogging for years on his.

You brought up a lot more than this--I don't want to reduce everything you
said to just this one wrinkle, because actually I appreciate everything
you've said, and wonder if I'm not just overly-optimistic about everything.
("What, Me Worry?") But, work! Augh. Maybe more tomorrow, although I feel
like I've been overposting ... anyway, I mostly wanted you to elaborate on
your original post so I could better understand what you meant ... & you
have & I do ...

Steve Kowit is a great teacher. Does this make him an academic? I met
him at Southwestern College in Chula Vista, where he is a very
important intellectual/academic figure; for many students he
represents a key signpost in the academic journey. Is there anyone
out there who has a problem with that? I can think of a dozen of
students I actively encouraged to seek him out as a teacher, mentor,
friend, poet (though not necessarily in that order) and about five or
six who had already done so when I met them. The point is that what's
getting called "academic" here seems to totally miss the point about
what it is that "we" do in the academy--and boy, I'm sure glad that
others have stepped in here to respond to what seems like one of the
annual threads. This continual stream of consciousness, like a
virtual Steve Kowit, can be an instructive rescue for a struggler in
the desert. There are many deserts. Lets not get out of hand here.
Thanks for the thoughts.

Hey Mark Ducharme:

Are you sure I don't go so far as a "direct call for action"? I thought
"Maintain the possibility of an outside" was pretty clear cut. Still, I agree,
it's precisely the interrelation between academic and non-academic contexts
that I'm discussing, and the fact that the differences are not clear cut. But
my sense is that the power dynamic is shifting, much too heavily, in the
direction of academic control--and as Tom Bell says, its underlying power,
money, of the U.S. capitalist variety--although as Gary points out, maybe it
depends partly on where you live and work. I'm all for speaking about the
value of the small presses, and for lauding what they do. And I'm actually all
for the continued work of non-mainstream poets inside the academy. But to say,
"Look at the great things going on!"--true as it is--doesn't, I think,
adequately address how power works WITHIN the context of contemporary
non-mainstream poetries.

I Reply:

I wish I could understand what motivates the sort of thought
expressed above. It's wrong in its assumption (somehow being an
academic isn't a "job"), and in its question. Academics have no
greater or lesser ability to be innovative than do poets who follow
different career paths.

There is some talk about what looking at student papers (and poems)
might do to a poet's ability to think clearly . . . but the same could be
said for working, where, a bank maybe? Or driving a bus . . . really
this kind of thinking is of the same sort George Bush likes to trot out .
. . you know, who's really American, that sort of thing.

The examples don't support any of these assumptions or accusations.
(Just a couple/few current academics for you: Susan Howe. Maxine
Chernoff. Cole Swensen. The list goes on.)

To which I say, brava!  I suppose *I* am one of those
young women with conventional dreams for whom Plath
has always been a model...because as an American
woman, it's SOOOO conventional to want to be a
brilliant, famous, influential poet and mother all at
the same time, to do it while you're young, to
dedicate your life to work that is raw and powerful,

Thanks, Kasey--provocative post, as always. Now I finally get to ask
about something that's been bothering me for decades. Almost the last
thing in Wieners's 1964 _Ace of Pentacles_ is the poem "The Suicide." In
that book, it's a two-part poem, and it ends very strangely, with a
comma:

        Clay cannot create her features
        nor mirror reveal her mouth

        Photograph not show her form
        full with self, so put away

        her picture from the shelf
        And turn instead to living

        woman on the couch, decked with flowers
        as if it were she laid out,

        and not Sylvia, in the woods,

But who is Sylvia? Did Wieners cross (Boston) paths with Plath, who of
course died in 1963, the year before the book is published? He seems to
throw some light on this in the poem's first section: "Yes, earth owns
the wind / As I her life / Whom I have never seen / Nor been with /
Still within our hearts there lies / this communion / of all that dies /
we held in common / because without it // we become more common than the
dust."

By the time _Ace of Pentacles_ is reprinted in the Black Sparrow
_Selected_ (1986), the odd but haunting comma has been replaced by a
period. Was it just a typo? And what had been the next to last poem in
_Ace of Pentacles_,  "Address to the Woman," becomes the third part of
"The Suicide, " which now ends:

        Tell her that may not speak again
        Her words are warnings in the wood.

Those lines read pretty resonantly as the sixties wore on.

So, does anyone know?

I was thinking about this on the train in to work this morning, and it
occurred to me that one of the most interesting projects of the last 5-10
years, w/respect to its relationship to the academy, and in fact especially
with how much it has (figuratively speaking) wrested from academic control,
let's say, is Steve Clay's Granary Books.

Granary of course has published the criticism of the work of a few
academics, most notably Johanna Drucker. Some great books--largely relating
to a realm not yet fully recognized by the academy (artists' books). There's
also The Book of the Book, Charles' interview with David Antin, and so on.

But maybe most significantly for this discussion, Steve has begun a project
involving the publishing of *literary history*, which I think has always
tended to be published by the academy. I mean, he's really given this back
to the poets. A Secret Location on the Lower East Side is an amazing example
of this--and not only did it mean that all of those magazines and presses
were made "legitimate," given value, for a larger audience (and through the
frames of the poets who created that history), but Steve also made sure that
collections of those books wound up in the New York Public Library & in
numerous other collections. Just out, of course, is another volume along
these lines: Guy Bennett & Béatrice Mousli's, Charting the Here of There:
French & American Poetry in Translation in Literary Magazines, 1850?2002.

Steve isn't independently wealthy. These books are made possible in part
through the sales of artists' books that he's published and sells to
collectors, and very large collections of rare books that he buys from other
collectors (mostly poets) and then I think resells to other collectors
and/or libraries. He's brilliant, I think, and more to the point, he's
really working to support poets working both outside and inside the academy,
in a way that I think takes the control from the academy (if they indeed had
it) and puts it into the hands of the poets he's supporting.

I shouldn't probably mention Swoon, because of my obvious personal
investment in that book--but I'm incredibly grateful to Steve for putting it
out--and I don't know why I wasn't thinking about this yesterday, but it's a
book largely of Nada & my poetics. Neither of us have really spent much of
our time writing up our poetics, but like many poets, we do talk about it at
least casually, and much of that discussion wound up in the book, in such a
way that the poems become completely embedded in their very specific
historical context.

Jack Kimball of course is beginning to do things along these lines--that
really great memoir of Tony Towle's--again an instance of a poet being
alowed to present his/her own history--was written because Jack thought to
approach Tony about doing such a book. Think too of the collections he
facillitated on his eastvillage site--mini geographically situated
anthologies--of NYC, LA, Boston.

That I've been particularly fortunate to have some involvement in the above
probably accounts for my admittedly unabashed enthusiasm/optimism w/respect
to a poet's situation vis-a-vis larger structures of power. But one could
look at this activity and be *inspired* by it. Use these instances as models
or inspiration for future projects. There's no reason, for instance, that I
couldn't decide one day to put together a history or memoir of San Francisco
in the 80s, say. And use my own press Detour to put it out. I think the DC
website, actually, is another amazing project along these lines--I don't
know if the historical stuff there was started by Jen and Allison or if it
was Tom Orange or who was initially involved in that, but I actually go
there quite frequently; I think it's great. It could easily be developed
into a book.

Anyway. Totally overposting. Nada said I should just start a blog and shut
up on Poetics. (She didn't say it that meanly.) She's right!

Thanks to Stephen Ellis, who in response to my query (poetics, what's
that) directed me to Aristotle. If I recall correctly Aristotle
investigated what the physical effect of drama and poetry was on its
audience and how they achieved that effect.

I believe Mark was referring not to that kind of investigation but to a
more prescriptive genre-blurring discourse that intends simultaneously to
achieve to theorize and to ratify a mental effect on its audience.

I also believe that that idealized discourse has been abandoned not only
by the non-academic presses, but by those best equipped to generate it.
In its place we have a terminally nerdy cascade of proper names,
groupings, and anthology tables-of-contents.

The tale of the tribe will always be part of what we need to hear. But
maybe this avant-garde is fighting the last war against an official verse
culture. Accountants and consultants sent out by the same dispatcher are
going to forget which hat they're wearing.

The idealized discourse is getting you down! Let it go. Write reviews.
Write poems. Look again at Code of Signals, Call Me Ishmael. Write a book
called My Susan Howe and send it to Ron Silliman. Let go of the proper
names and the anthology page counts.

That's my plan anyway, that and to subscribe to a magazine or two
(finally).

okay, time for me to be the unbearable philistine again...i actually
got a lot out of the artist's way, and i've bought a bunch of those
other books --i haven't read them, but, to put it in non-philistine
terms, the "sociology of poetry" interests me --i *like* it that
people are trying to turn other people on to poetry.  some could say
that the book i co-authored, The Secret Life of Words,is a dumbing
down of poetic experimentalism (i wrote it w/ someone who specializes
in educational publishing and it was pitched to the mainstream).

Some darling she turned out to be, eh? George, did you follow her work
as the "conventional dreams" went rather spectacularly awry?

If you did, perhaps you found it wanting. . . .

The Ostrobothnians (in the wild west of Finland) have a saying: "I am
from us, and the rest are from elsewhere." Maybe that's the problem with
camps--they're a brilliant marketing device, and a whole hell of a lot
of tribal-bonding other-bashing territory-marking fun. But they also
have an unfortunate side-effect, if and when they keep us from reading
our enemies.

Which is why I think it's crazy-wonderful that Berrigan read Wilbur, or
Wieners quoted Auden (as he did).

What about Eliot. Whose darling was he? And yet we read him, don't we?

Sorry to send an unfinished message before--thought I'd hit "Draft" but must
have hit "Send."

In any case, Mark, I think your suggestions re reviews are exactly pertinent,
and would make a difference in the way that you suggest--a greater awareness
and acting on that awareness always helps. And I think that Gary's precise
delineation of non-academic institutions and the role they play is also very
much to the point (and I appreciate his recognition that such places ARE
institutions--after all, it's not as though outside the academic world, there
are no problems of hierarchy and access to resources). And I agree too with
Joe that a precise sociological description would help, although I'd have to
worry, obviously, about the terms in which such a sociology could be couched.
All I would add, because I think I've said what I have to say on this and at
this point it may be obvious, is that the relationship between non-mainstream
poetries and the academic context is always changing. When we assume, by
defintion, that they're enemies of each other, or we assume by definition that
they are, can be, or should be mutually supportive, we tend to overlook the
specific nature of the changes actually occuring--changes that to my mind,
lately, seem like a growing imbalance of power.

Before I get into the upcoming event, let me briefly mention the latest
Singing Horse title, published by our sage Gil Ott.

Chris McCreary's THE EFFACEMENTS, flip the book over it becomes Jenn
McCreary's A DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES.  $12.50, available through <A
HREF="http://www.spdbooks.org">http://www.spdbooks.org</A>

The unique cover of crisp greens and white makes an immediate impact to get
you harvesting beyond its rush of black and white photographs.

Don't make my mistake of reading a Chris poem, flipping the book to read a
Jenn poem, and so on.  These two books within a book deserve full attention
to their separate tones of arrangement.

Hold it!  I really don't mean for this to become a book review, so let me end
now by saying that recently a poet said of the McCrearys being the Waldrops
of our generation.  Okay, I can see why this is said, and although it seems
flattering, such comparisons are simply lazy, spiritless suggestions which
ultimately take AWAY FROM the power of those in question.  I'd rather say the
McCrearys are the McCrearys of my generation, and they're separate and
together among the BEST we've got!  Buy their fantastic new book and figure
it yourself!

Subject:      Re: inside/outside the academy
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hey Mark Wallace et. al.,

I do see a "call to action" of sorts in your "Maintain the possibility of an
outside," & perhaps more in your (I'm paraphrasing from memory) attend to
poets outside, not because they're better, but because they MIGHT be.  Yet I
felt if you left it at just that, then the overall "message" is that it
sucks & there's not much we can do about it.  This is not the way I want to
feel about it, clearly this is not how Gary wants to (or does) feel about
it, & this is not the way I want the list as a whole, including you, to feel
about it.  So I did want to bring up more specific things that we can do.

I am also glad that the issue of money has been brought up.  I had wanted to
ask for instance, what specifically we mean by "poetic success"-- which is
(as I see it) a can of worms, & yesterday I felt I had already wasted too
much time writing what I did, so I didn't want to get into that as well.
But, yes, success (even of the cultural capitalistic variety) in this
society often comes down to money, even if only in indirect ways (e.g., the
"prestige" [read: wealth] of the institution you profess for, graduated
from, etc.).

I know that you are all for supporting small presses, & again, I was not
trying to suggest otherwise.  And it ~is~ also important that nonmainstream
poets can & do work inside the academy.  I even agree that "to say, 'Look at
the great things going on!'--true as it is--doesn't... adequately address
how power works WITHIN the context of contemporary non-mainstream poetries."
  However I'd like to turn this question back to you (or to anyone out
there)-- frankly, because I think it's an important question, & I don't know
the answer myself: how CAN the workings of power within institutional
contexts BE addressed, in a way that advances nonmainstream poetries.  Now
you're gonna say this is a rhetorical question, & sure, it is, in the sense
that I don't expect there to BE one answer, or certainly not any simple,
clear-cut one.  Perhaps in fact there isn't any answer, though more likely I
think the answers are to be found on a case-by-case basis.  But I ask this,
not naively, because I think it's important for us to think about (or to
think about in broader terms-- because it's not like most of us haven't
thought of it already, in specific reference to ourselves or to the work
we're promoting).

Finally (because this is becoming much longer than I had intended)-- there
seems to be some question about what poetics is.  Without falling back on
Aristotle (who, you're right Jordan, had a different sense of the word than
we would today), I would say that to me to me it's simple.  When a poet
writes about artistic principles (to sound Poundian for a minute), &/or
writes about the work of other poets in a way that sheds light on both the
other poets' work as well as the poetic ideas of the person writing, then
that is poetics.  That is what I see in the great essays by Pound, Williams,
Stein, Zukofsky, Riding, Olson, Creeley, as well as all those essays & books
by the Language poets.  That is what I try to do when I write essays, and
that is what I see in the best essays by contemporaries (including Mark, and
including Chris Stroffolino whom I'm glad someone mentioned, Kristin
Prevallet, Julianna Spahr, many others).  For a while it seemed like poetics
essays were going to play a more vital role for poets who are now, let's
say, in their 40s & younger.  There used to be lively, low-budget magazines
like Witz & Poetic Briefs, but those died out.  To some extent they were
replaced by web journals like Gary's _readme_ (which I hear is also on its
way out).  But really I think the energy toward writing essays has been
dissipated, at least to an extent, by blogs (in Ron Silliman's & others'
cases), & by the conversation, at its best, that goes on on this list.  In
some ways that immediacy is an advantage, in other ways a distraction.
Certainly ~this~ is a conversation, I think, that bears out the value of
this list, despite its distractions.

Dana Gioia has a day job and he is no experimentalist.  Can we just lay to
the rest the bogus equation that being an academic = sell out?  For a day
or two...from where I sit (finishing PhD student in British literature),
to have a job outside of academia is to "sell out," so I kinda find this
talk adolescent for a number of reasons.  what should be sold out is the
rhetoric of selling out.

(for Jordan Davis & Jim Behrle)

this is an idea (god, that sounds pretentious, but whatever...):  how
about poetry junk mail?  a monthly mass mailing of a poem on a broadside.
(relatively decent paper, with some visual candy).  this is a country-wide
version of poetry on the bus.  what is it that we are surrounded by, but
those random missives from the outside vendors, wanting to welcome us into
their happy fold of customers.  i bet one could generate a database of a
a million names and leaflet our towns and cities.  say, anyone who submits
a poem to a journal or magazine automatically gets listed.

underlying assumption is that what be sent is unjustly obscure american
poets.  maybe a reproduction of Dickinson fascicle.  maybe some poetic
obscurantism by Emerson, but i myself would start with Stein.  (for
today, i am actually thinking of Creeley's "I know a man"). thence to
Williams.  thence to Zukofsky. the names and faces can change:  the
point to get poetry under people's noses and not over their heads.

Let's expand that to "literary and poetic value," and let's acknowledge the
the sales figures on Amazon can be "influenced" with a few key buys.  When my
story collection came out in 2000, after a mass mailing, I had about 60 sales
in a hour which jumped the book from 1,000,000 in the rankings to 1,200.
Didn't that feel glorious -- for half a day.

1) actually Gioia quit his day job in New Jersey (his wife and he ran
the Roerich Museum readings) and moved back west (he went to Stanford
undergrad, I think) right before he wrote a series of polemics, opera
reviews, and translations in an attempt to make his poetry and related
writing pay (which it now does) -- tho he doesn't teach, I don't know
that he has a day job

for the poetry wars in general -- I think it is Al Filreis' book which
tracks Stevens' career -- I thought he was an EVP who hitched his star

2) just send something to the styles already; I did -- it was about
fashion,  from a series of poems and prose poems which are not anecdotes
about "moments that changed my life" -- the editor writes the little

really don't know -- I remember a scrap of something unfortunate about
giants' tears -- but I do wonder at her 45 years of sustained and

then anthology inclusion?  if we re-engineer these processes, will the

independent of poet poets but not trained employees acting as poets (are
they poets?), be more efficient?  will it have more "quality"?

My favorite use of the term is for naming any process by which poets
discuss, define and explicate their own art as here on this list. But I've
been contemplating a new term for what has frequently occurred here of late
(not on this thread): "Slam Poetics."

Well, what I picked up was Sylvia saying I feel terrible; therefore
it is a terrible world.

I think that HD was the best poem-maker in the US till 1961. She too
wrote about her own situation, but she wrote through the imagination
rather than the self-regard that says this ought to get them
whimpering.

"any process by which poets
discuss, define and explicate their own art"

This sounds like self-analysis a la Karen Horney.

It also reminds me of Norman Mailer's parody
of Whitman: Advertisements for myself.

I realize (thanks to a remarkable essay by
Susan Schultz on list owner Charles Bernstein
in Issue 14 of Jacket) that self-presentation
is an issue poets would be wise to attend to.

And as I've had kindly pointed out to me by
Rod Smith, I wouldn't want to go messing with
any poet's prerogative to swerve from sense
to nonsense and back. I wouldn't want to ask
anyone to justify any particular bout of
abstract ear.

My concern: we valorize the capacity to say
whatever comes into our heads or out through
our pens keyboards mouths. In therapy, though,
free association is often (productively)
followed by the question, so what are you saying
there, or by the therapist's abstraction from
the subject's words.

The goal doesn't have to be a marketable
consistency of self, by any means. By any
means necessary. (The Audubon now has an
X Caffe, by the way.) There doesn't even
need to be agreement on the goal, for there
to be a definition of poetics. I admit
that although I'm more interested in
understanding art in general than my art
in particular, I do keep a blog for my
observations on forms that I explode
over and over like a poorly-supervised
eighth grader. (Backchannel for details.)

Now, having advertised myself, I mention
my concern that the idealized discourse
that I suggested before could be let go
without real damage to our writing selves
imposes a feedback loop -- writing while
justifying the writing in genre-blurring
writing... don't get me wrong, I think
Yo La Tengo went a little soft after
Electr-o-Pura (ok after President!), but
feedback also needs to be understood.

Poetics, essays, projective Olsonian
criticism, rhapsodism, are they serving
understanding or are they carrying
understanding away. Headline in the
Onion: Gambling-Addiction study getting
out of hand.

I like Nick's answer about the process by which we define, explicate, etc. our
practice.  I think there's also a prescriptive or evaluative element involved:
an explicit or implicit imperative.  How about we all come up with our own
one-sentence prescriptive poetics, as basic and economical (and maybe
incendiary) as we can make it?  Here's mine:

"A poem should be interesting as language and in at least one other way."

> Review a small press book this year, and hang around
where you're not wanted--




While there's definitely something positive and
generous about the spirit of that mission (and the
reviews that I myself have published were, I think,
~only~ of small press books: Spuyten Duyvil, Avec, Sun
& Moon, etc.),---

I feel there's something slightly missing or misaimed
in that strategy.  (The idea was: if half the List
were to write reviews about small press and half the
teachers were to teach an exo-academic book,--- then,
let a thousand poets bloom!)

But neither reputations nor "poetic value" are made in
that way.

The proposal, while healthy, promises proliferation
but at the risk of diffusion and dispersion (as I
suspect is already the case).

To the contrary, part of how poetic value and canon
("fame") were engineered, how the poets taught by
academia were brought to the attention of academia in
the first place, was through concerted if unorganized
~consensus~ around certain names.

Reviews or criticism work by ~reiteration,~ not by
diversification.  "Fame" or poetic value is basically
a case of heavy ~redundancy~ that is achieved by a
ubiquitous repetition of the same names.  An Ashbery
is an Ashbery because ~everyone~ wrote about Ashbery.
And not because everyone (500 ur-List members) was
writing reviews.

(Isn't the battle cry, though, in fact asking
reviewers to serve the function of advertising and
promotion? ...Which may not be reviews' purpose.  It's
simplifying reviewers' place in the ecosystem into
entirely one of ~marketing.~  Much the same could be
accomplished, then, by calling for an increase in the
advertising budget of small presses.

(Interestingly, too, this hope placed in what is very
significantly being designated as "reviews" skirts all
the List's earlier feuds of an antagonism between poet
and ~critic.~  Is the clarion call marshalling reviews
but ~not~ "criticism"?  Does writing reviews make the
journalist a critic?)

Too widespread a practice of insufficiently reenforced
"publicity" even becomes a thinning-out of the whole
mechanism, and leads to a leveling out of the playing
field.

In the two previous waves, the small New York School
coterie very interestingly operated under an unspoken
rule of mentioning, whenever and wherever, the names
of their poet friends,--- so that, from their earliest
interviews on, Ashbery would name-drop Koch, Koch
Ashbery, etc; even in their art criticism (reviews of
painting exhibitions), they would often stretch the
point unabashedly to name-drop by metaphor or by non
sequitur.  Although Language Poetry's initial body of
poets' criticism was largely self-published rather
than institution-dependent, the same
self-referentiality prevailed.

And it worked, tactically.

(There may be other nuances to this, too. Criticism or
reviews begin to take on their fullest force, as they
do in popular arts such as film or best-sellers, when
the broad attention assured by a large enough body of
reviewers allows ~the negative review~ to enter into
the mix, without threatening the welfare and future of
the work reviewed but by pulling out other overlooked
dimensions of it,--- and the reviews/criticism
developing into a full dialectical system,
"point/counter-point" --- or "healthy debate.")

In the absence of the Language Poetry that the List
was originally consecrated to preserve and foster, all
the ongoing discussion tacitly avoids the sort of
unanimities and naming-of-names that might make that
possible, though.


Lastly--(?)--- but on a somewhat different note,

isn't the originality of the idea simply that we
should deploy things exactly as they are?  That is,
all the minuets and courtseys of the publishing world,
reviewers and reviewed, remain in place but that this
reenvigorated use of it would somehow succeed in doing
what the same means has gradually been going obsolete
over?

Personally, I wonder if readership wouldn't increase
faster if more ~PEOPLE Magazine~ methods weren't used:
cult of personality, gossip, biography as pornography,
scandal...

Again, the handy example of Ashbery (Ashbery Ashbery
Ashbery): Has he ever given a single interview where
he doesn't immediately manage to wheedle in the slick
image-styling of saying that

he grew up on his father's farm?

I'm going to be in Amsterdam next week and am wondering whether there's

poetry-speaking...  Bookstores, venues for readings, poets, etc... or maybe
something completely fabulous in the arts that's not poetry-related.  I've

Anything out of the ordinary or extraordinary welcomed.

Just want to say I think this is a great idea.  Tho I would suggest poems by
living writers instead of (or in addition to) dead greats.

If the paper costs, etc. proved too high, how about just poetry spam?
Thousands of unsolicited poetry e-mails, clogging up everyone's in-box,
uncontrolled, undisciplined, unedited....

Oh, wait: that's this list.

K.




P.S.  I really do like the idea.

Following the thread on academic/non-academic presses/inside/outside the =
academy and what exactly *poetics* is has been very interesting, and to =
my mind, interrelated. In all of these pixelated conversations I find it =
curious that few listers have articulated the concept of access. Who has =
it, and how, what you do with that access once you procure it. I could =
keep going with these questions, but I think that there has been =
adequate representation of the convolutions of this =
subject/dichotomy/riddle.

If there is to be *success* in poetics, how does one quantify that? By =
opening doors, by initiating conversations, by reading and attending =
events by people working in other "non-academic" forms- or venues, by =
hosting and publicizing readings, conferences, etc. to more than the =
narrow community you may move, and feel comfortably ensconced within.=20

If there is to be a modicum of *success* in poetics- doesn't it come =
from ongoing intercourse with eachother's work and simply getting the =
work out there? By using one's access to cultivate discussion, =
opportunity and events for those who may not have the same access to =
resources? Small presses, regardless of their affiliation, seem =
particularly poised for agility in this regard. At any rate, if you are =
truly interested in this concept, perhaps regard your own set of =
circumstances and what is possible within the access you have. And =
perhaps ask yourself how the divisions serve or hinder your intent.=20

Mark,

If one splits the history of American poetry into generations and then
examines which poets of previous generations we admire most, do we see that
we admire those who lived in the academy most? I don't think so. Isn;t it
that the Black Mountain group or the Objectivists or the New York School or
Duncan and Spicer all thrived outside the academy. Some of the members might
have teached in the academy (e.g. Bob Creely); but that occurred after his
reputation was established more or less.

Even T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein left the country.

W.C. Williams was a doctor.

Very few Beats taught, Allen late in his life.

It appears to me the presence of academic teaching as a full time job is a
relatively recent development in American poetic culture, partly maybe due to
proliferation of writing programs and invention of adjunct teaching (which in
a more industrial context would be called scab labor).

In my opinion the idea of the academic (in American poetry) needs to be
treated historically, which had a beginning and possibly and end. This way
one sees its power is less than one thinks. For instance, do academic
publications have so much more distribution that small presses (if one takes
the idea of "prestige" out)? Even C. Bernstein's "Content's Dream." To me
it's his most influential book, first published, if I am not wrong, by Sun
and Moon." Was L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E an academic publication?

Just some thoughts.

Very few, if any, of the Turkish poets teach. Some are in advertizments or
scinces or writing for newspapers or translating or some kind of business.
Some just don't work, rich parents, rich spouses or "borrow" from friends.

I'm only catching bits and pieces of this thread so far, but I thought I'd
add that Ezra Pound actually commented on this "relatively new development"
in a Paris Review interview (1966 sounds like the year, but all from memory
as my books are several thousand miles away). He said something along the
lines that it's inevitable that poets teach and live by academia.. a poet's
got to earn a living somehow.

Best,
Ben

read her work without signing up for any victim-cult. That was my point.
Not that I endorse her goofy world-view, any more than Marjorie Perloff
does when she calls Plath "an extraordinary poet" or speaks of her
"peculiar ability to fuse the domestic and the hallucinatory."

You don't have to drink the toxic Kool-Aid to see that there's something
going on in the poems. Nor does reading Pound or Eliot or Baraka turn me
into a raving anti-Semite. Perloff again: "Only now, some twenty-five
years after her death, can we begin to assess her oeuvre." But the
flashpoints of the last couple of days make it clear that this is still
a pretty difficult task.

JDavis & Dears,
Gambling-Addiction studies get out of hand only for those not Horn(e)y
enough to headline them.  Girls on the Run, we call them where I come from.
Isn't poetics really a sort of under-the-armpit garment odor left in the
closet of one state and arrived in the pleasure of a second day in some
next, a sort of partly remembered blip from short-term dance hall sweat
theorized into the long-term rapacious figure everyone brags about
extensively but no one can really see?  Writing about an exciting experience
is more exciting than experiencing the excitment of an experience, which is
boring, entirely, because there's always too much to say about it.  Which is
what "poetics" is for.  It's the cushion against which one writes.  It's a
word for all the ways in which Matter comes into the work to call foul, let
everything out, fuck things up, and "have a word with you".  Relation, or as
a friend once wrote, "when I say We, You know who I'm talking about."

I should have written "explicate each others art." I think K. Silem
understood what I was getting at, but then again, without inventive
misreadings where we would we poets be? Jordan's point about free
association seems useful. In this model I would suggest that the poems are
the "free associations" and the poetics are the "interpretations." But an
important difference is that therapy- in my view- is out to help people feel
and function better; i.e., have more effective answers for themselves. Then
we need poetry, poetics (and other disciplines) to feel and function more
comprehensively; i.e., ask- sometimes insist on- more effective questions
for ourselves, each other and the culture(s) we live in and among.
-
Can't help mentioning-seeing K's subject line "Whutz poetix?"- a terrific
essay by Eileen Myles in her book "On My Way" (Faux Press, 2001). The essay
is titled "The End of New England" and it concerns the issue of class in
everyday speech and poetry. She writes: "....(and in some ways I'm thinking
about all writers who are essentially always engaged in this act of
translation every day, turning things into symbols) are typically moving
between one language and another, for instance-shuttling between the
literary language which is written and more affiliated with the middle class
and up, and the working and lower classes whose story is generally spoken:
it's a language of pleasure, adjustment and use. By its very nature it's a
language of repetition, shorthand, working class language is incomplete.
"Heads up!"Whatcha gonna do means something vastly different from What are
you going to do...What are you going to do is a guidance counselor, a human
being demanding a reply from another, not a human being looking at another
human being looking at a machine, the job, or the bigger machine, which is
life."

murat, you generally say a lot of things with which i agree (i too
think ~a.i.~ is one of the great films of the past 50
years---something i've been wanting to post here for a while now), or
am at least provoked by...

but when you compare adjunct teachers in academe to "scabs," well
that really gets my goat, murat... and i'm probably as pro-collective
bargaining as you're gonna find in these parts... there are so many
reasons why that's just not so (never mind a closer interrogation of
"scab")---and to suggest as much does a great disservice to that
exploited class of laborers upon which so many campuses have come to
rely (and as a matter of full disclosure, i've worked as such a
"scab," and my partner kass fleisher has been a "scab" in such terms
for 15 years now---and my dad was a union steward... so this really
really strikes a nerve in me)...

i'm gonna leave that one alone and ask you to reconsider that term,
in this context... b/c i don't want to lecture you, murat, of all
people, as to the history of academic collective bargaining and such
like...

also, why don't those of you who are interested run right out and
pick up d. g. myers's ~the elephants teach:  creative writing since
1880~ (prentice hall, 1996)... whatever problems with myers's account
(about which, btw, kass and i have written extensively), it'll clear
up some of the (forgive me) half-truths i'm listening to re the
history of creative writing instruction vis-a-vis modernist
poetics... some of you may be surprised at just how tangled this
academic history is...

so there...

aldon:  since i'm in such a dis-agreeable mood/mode (!), i thought
i'd depart a bit from your analysis of the reception of "exp." prose
v. "exp." poetry... i think (as you suggest, yes) there really isn't
substantive difference here, finally, not least b/c the only people
in academe really willing to read/publish/edit "exp." prose are poets
(with the exception of a relatively small group-within-the group of
fiction writers and digital writers)... which kinda throws things in
relief... and which might presume too that we can identify an "exp."
prose that departs from "exp." fiction---& personally, i find this
distinction worth considering, esp. given the publishing realities...

mark w:  yes, the terms of sociological analysis are often
problematic... to say it more firmly though:  the idea that "poetry"
(if w/o quotes, i might write poetic practice) and its relationship
with academe can be fruitfully discussed w/o recourse to cultural
contexts that include both strikes me as wrongheaded... and btw, i'll
be using (among other small press items) your ~nothing happened and
besides i wasn't there~ in my grad course next semester (it's still
available i hope!)---and i think doing so is one way academics can
work to support the small presses and small press authors (of which i
is one mself, as you know mark)... that course will also include a
healthy quotient of poetics, another way to productively disturb the
creative writing enclave as i've come to understand same... in truth,
it's difficult to find worthy poetics, imho, outside of the academic
presses (with the exceptions many have already noted, and a few
others)... at the same time, one of the mainstays of the anti-theory
effort (in & out of academe) has been that "literature" itself
contains all of the theory one needs to know... now i've heard this
latter mouthed by folks who are a helluvalot smarter than the
reactionary populace, so while an element of truth inheres therein,
it can also become a dodge for doing any real thinking in the
creative writing classroom...

so there...

as to the lamentable state of post/secondary affairs:  yep---they've
paved paradise, put up a parking lot... or was it paradise?... and is
it a parking lot?... in any case, what do y'all want to do
now?---tell your kids to forget about higher learning if they have
any artistic inclinations whatsoever?... and what if they want to
teach?...

c'mon now...

best,

 Senate Remarks:  A Preordained Course of Action on Iraq


      The Moving Finger writes; and having writ,
      Moves on; nor all your Piety nor Wit
      Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
      Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.

So said the Persian poet Omar Khayyam in the 11th century.  So say I today.
The Senate has made clear its intent on the Iraq resolution.  The outcome is
certain; the ending has been scripted.  The Senate will vote, and the Iraq
resolution will pass.

I continue to believe that the Senate, in following this preordained course
of action, will be doing a grave disservice to this nation and to the
Constitution on which it was founded. In the newly published  National
Security Strategy of the United States - the document in which the President
outlines the unprecedented policy of pre-emptive deterrence which the Iraq
resolution will implement - he asserts that the Constitution has served us
well, as though it were some dusty relic of the past that needs to be
eulogized before it is retired.  He is wrong.  The Constitution is no more
dated in the principles it established than is the Bible. The Constitution
continues to serve us well, if only we will take the time to heed it.

I am deeply disappointed that the Senate is not heeding the imperatives of
the Constitution and is instead poised to hand off to the President the
exclusive power of Congress to determine matters of war and peace.

I do not, in my heart of hearts, believe that this is what the American
people expect of the Senate.  I have heard from tens of thousands of
Americans - people from all across this country of ours - who have urged me
to keep up the fight.  I am only one Senator from a small state, yet in the
past week I have received nearly 20,000 telephone calls and nearly 50,000
e-mails supporting my position.

I want all of those people across America who took the time to contact me to
know how their words have heartened me and sustained me in my efforts to
turn the tide of opinion in the Senate. They are my heroes, and I will never
forget the remarkable courage and patriotism that reverberated in the fervor
of their messages.

As the apostle Paul said, "I  have fought a good fight, I have finished my
course, I have kept the faith." There are Americans all across this country
who have joined in spirit with me and a small band of like-minded Senators
in fighting the good fight. We could stay here on the floor and continue to
fight, and it is certainly a fight worth the effort.  But there is also a
point at which it becomes time to accept reality and to regroup.  It is
clear that we have lost the battle in the Senate, but we have not yet lost
the war.

The next front is the White House, and I urge all those people who are
following this debate, and who have encouraged me in my efforts, to turn
their attention to the President. Call him, write him, e-mail him.  Urge him
to heed the Constitution and not short-circuit it by exercising the broad
grant of authority that the Iraq resolution provides.

The President has said on many occasions that he has not yet made up his
mind to go to war.  When he does make up his mind - if he does - then he
should come back to Congress and seek formal authorization. Let him use this
Iraq resolution as leverage with the United Nations, if that is what he
wants it for, but when it comes time for the United States to undertake
military action, let him come back to the Congress for authorization.

I continue to have faith in our system of government.  I continue to have
faith in the basic values that shaped this nation.  Those values do not
include striking first against other nations.  Those values do not include
using our position as the strongest and most formidable nation in the world
to bully and intimidate other nations. Those values do not include putting
other nations on an enemies list so that we can justify pre-emptive military
action.

Were I not to believe in the inherent ability of the Constitution to
withstand the folly of such actions as the Senate is about to take, I would
not stop fighting.  I would fight with every fiber of my body, every ounce
of my energy, with every parliamentary tool at my disposal.  But I do
believe that the Constitution will weather this storm. The Senate will
weather the storm as well, but I only hope that when this tempest passes,
Senators will reflect on the ramifications of what they have done and
understand the damage  that has been inflicted on the Constitution.

In this debate, the American people seem to have a better understanding of
the Constitution than those who are elected to represent them.  Perhaps it
is that their understanding of the Constitution is not filtered through the
prism of election year politics.  For whatever reason, I believe that the
American people have a better understanding of what the Senate is about to
do, a greater respect for the inherent powers of the Constitution, and a
greater comprehension of the far-reaching consequences of this resolution
than do most of their leaders.

I thank my colleagues who have allowed me to express at length my reasons
for opposing this resolution.  I thank those Senators who have stood with
me, supported me, and encouraged me.  I thank those Senators who have
engaged in thoughtful debate with me.  I do not believe that the Senate has
given enough time or enough consideration to the question of handing the
President unchecked authority  to usurp the Constitution and declare war on
Iraq.  But I accept the futility of continuing to fight on this front.

I say to the people of America, to those who have encouraged me and others
to uphold the principles of the Constitution, keep up the fight.  Keep
fighting for what is right.  Let your voices be heard.  I will always listen
to you, and I hope that the President will begin to listen to you.  May God
bless you in your endeavors.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.

steady now

undoing the creeping
                     light
mothers make watching

my hustle

easy to avoid the

radio waves we broadcast

all S.O.S. and HELPS

girls you are not

       looking at

you are, a possible

      across

    the broken martini

and arm of a

jammed up with fresh

ennui, in time for moving
nights, the awnings of
nasty spots hovering

yet, ready for the blender






104.
mothers now married

evenly divided through
                    the states
guessing wrong the

mayors of their souls

elected for life and
gone from all scenes

married mothers!
envy me!

gelatinous and free!




105.

there is cola in my eye




in other news: spring

now it feels funny
                     to move

        or stay still



106.

you're merely the

        latest          sinkhole


        a chicken chow

fear the express, cause

where you're headed is

way worse than you've heard



107.


these flags are tired
        of waving and
want to be put away

                must be
        such a hassle to
        be loved so much

a hoop broken by

        vicious, gorgeous slams


108.

thus transported and
transformed by dinner's smell



your future ginger ale awaits


with many chilly fellas

in the shadow of
maybe
the fattest panda




109.


tonight to be filled with
                     dirty thoughts



                 of Jenny


during "Star Trek:

                        my mind

auroras of pain are

rue being empty
and headlights angrily
                                 halo
rest your arms along
endless tabletops by mirrors

everyone's on the phone or
dialing, all circuits whine




111.


startled in releasing

        like kittens
        attacking your

        voice, new mothers

prepare to be boarded

        sagging with panic

        it's something else
        entirely

        how snoring is born

deviously begin to

lemon refreshment 40 feet tall
surveills everyone

aware, wise to its caper
        at stoplights behind

heatedly, murmur and tips

you demanded rain
until the strike was over


please request this
again, dusty warm breath

its own sweet reward

let's get cracking

     if only while
     we're alive to

save the brilliant thoughts



and send kids off
                     to camp


116.

they say I can't rap about being
                        poor no more

hell of a way to cook a rabbit

available nights and weekends to

don't know if the below made it in my mini-flurry last night, but also
wanted to comment

1.  I think Nick is right that therapy is generally not as analytic and
explicatory and binding as people fear.   there are at least two ways of
doing it.  I tend to belong to the humanistic approach where my queries are
intended to bring out more writing, words, etc rather than being
prescriptive exclusionary or analytical.  Perhaps the same distinction might
be made in poetics?

2.  As jane Sprague noted, access is key in all of this but this begs the
question of access to whom?

I did appreciate something in Plath way back when we were first
encountering her dramatic career, and that was that she could really
handle that short line. I didnt care for all the self-pity, but I
thought the voice was pretty sure.

im climbing barbed wire to heaven -
im skating on thin ice for god -
im down on the rail and old number seven
rolls over with nary a nod -

im rolling the cards and tossing the pawn
and playing with angels for incense and gold -
my arms are tools of the dark devils spawn -
my torn bloody hands can hardly take hold -

of the wire and ice and fire and spice
the trains carrying down on the rail -
so careful of angles and star-spangled bangles
theyll carry you down without fail

from heaven to seven and a nod to a clod -
theyll carry you down like a pail
running out down the hill with a license to kill -
and the bodies are falling and children are bawling -
the worlds going out with a wail

In an essay or letter, I forget which--- Virginia
Woolf wrote asking what the purpose of (negative)
reviews were, and how things could be different.

She re-imagined reviews into a utopian, new situation.
 Rather than having the review put out in the public
sphere, where it might be an embarassment to the
author (out of modesty?  for unfairly biasing/seducing
readers?), she imagined that

an appointment could be scheduled between the author
and the critic, where the two would sit down
face-to-face for an hour or two, ~for the purpose of
the author taking in the criticism/review that is
*needed* for the work.~   I forget if she imagined
there might be some payment by the author for the
reviewer's services this way.  (If there were, surely
it would be transacted simply: an envelope pushed
across a tabletop.)



So, the essence of her idea was that reviews are a
~one-to-one~ communication between the critic and the
author, that the audience is more or less
inappropriately eavesdropping upon.

In re-imagining a world for reviews, note, she was
~not~ open or prone to imagine a world ~without~
reviews.

They were necessary to the writing, maybe even so
necessary that they shouldn't be diluted by the
voyeurism of the audience.



Were Woolf right, then, reviews, at base, rather than
being some piece of oratory similar to barkers at
circuses luring spectators into a sideshow tent to see
the Seal Boy,

would be

~one-to-one~ akin to the one-to-one of, say, love
poetry.

The motor force that drives the "good" review may be
very similar to the love sonnet, to ask a question
that will match an answer already given: who are you,
you enchanted me, you puzzled me.

["he kissed me, he but only kissed / The fingers of
this hand wherewith I write": Elizabeth Barrett
Browning, Sonnet XXXVIII]



The review was not always written as a bait to attract
consumers into purchasing books or seeing works.
Reviews (see French journalism from the eighteenth
century clear through at least around the 1930's, viz.
Caradec's biography of Roussel) were written in a
spirit where it was ~taken for granted~ that

anyone of taste, any member of the bourgeois community
*would have been there,*

or, if some obligation prevented them from attending,
such as ~another~ artwork (---how else, after all,
might people have occupied their evening, unless at a
dinner party?---), the review became a way of their
sorting through all the ~hearsay~ that they would have
encountered about it.

That is to say, the review as a way of giving shape to
jumbled impressions that needed sorting out, as a
spoon for cold tapioca, especially when it came to
controversial modernism.  The review standing in
relation to the artwork as a definition beside a word
in the dictionary, not contesting it or threatening it
bullyish, even where it exposes the original to
conceal some fault-line (slang), but simulating the
other half of the helix that artworks set up, since,
if one were not ~reading~ a review, one would be
arguing out a less clear-headed version of the same
with friends and neighbors ("What did you think of
it?": is it a basis for community or a new community,
or will it be divisive for us), but over too many
cupfuls or confections.


I would add:

Reviews have their own autonomy or independence from
the work they critique.  At its best, the review
derives from ~its own creativity.~

. . . Which is why, in general, the etiquette is that
(1) the artist puts out the artwork, then (2) the
reviewer hers,--- and ~there is no third step~ (3)
where the artist responds and contests the review.


(In fact, it does happen from time to time, usually to
the merriment of knockdown/drag-out results:  Los
Angeles Times, August 24, 1997 [four days before his
seventieth birthday], page 10: John Ashbery: "To the
Editor: . . . I'm also pleased that when Theroux
doesn't like my poetry he lumps me with 'the likes of
. . . yam-in-the-mouth Charles Olsen, a total fraud' .
. . I for one would have been interested to learn why
a writer of Theroux's stature has it in for . . .";
Alexander Theroux replies: "incomprehensible doodles
of his which he has the whim, even if I do not, to
call [poetry]. . . . although how the writer of the
following lines from "Idaho"

 "Carol!" he said. Can this be the one time
 ????????????????????????????????????????
 Biff: The last Rhode island reds are
 "diet of hamburgers and orange juice"
 I see into the fields of timothy
 one
 the others time
 change
 , , , , , , , and they walked back,
 small hand-assemblies"

 can presume to call upon anyone to clarify or outline
the nature of anything is beyond me. . . . How can a
poet of such byzantine contrivances . . . ? Who should
know better than he the moral and aesthetic bankruptcy
of calling gibberish "poetry" or nonsense "modernist"?
. . . My ambition is not that hacks stop writing or
that they stop publishing, but for anyone to try to
fob off twaddle as poetry, without criticism, is
another matter entirely. May I request that Ashbery do
me a favor in return? Only explain for me why there
are, respectively, precisely 40 question marks and
seven commas in a row in "Idaho" and whether using,
respectively, 39 and six would have ruined the meaning
of that, um, poem."  Ashbery Ashbery Ashbery)


One editor continually grills me on whether I'm
friends with the poet I want to review.  (But who
would befriend ~me?!~)   I'm not sure if reviews that
expressly entered into print with an agenda such as
promoting one rank of publishing houses against
another wouldn't be similarly partisan.


Although incomplete, this is my language of pleasure.

Tom-
Access to forums such as this and the people found here- an academic host
(sunyb), open to all. Democracy is, essentially and from the Gk. (Plato, I
think) the ability to participate in power, so, Bernstein has deployed
certain access that he has to create this forum, which spins off other
forums, of information, of name dropping, events, presses,  job openings,
actual human contact (phone callers...) etc. This list does enable and
empower us. To get the work out, to learn from and *listen* to each other,
and to provide community, which can often be lacking for those of us outside
of an urban area.

Access to RESOURCES: bringing poets to towns to speak, to give workshops, to
share their work. In Ithaca, while we watch the creep of Ameriland and the
influx of Borders & Barnes and Noble, it will be interesting to see how
corp. america expands any opportunities for gleaning knowledge for people
who may be less inclined to search out SPD, who may be limited in their
*access* to ideas/authors/whatever simply by their reliance on the dictates
of the mainstream marketplace. Or, Ameriland: the land of the Oprah poem, as
was borne out by the Dodge Fest. and the resounding snooze of most of the
poetics spewed forth there. And I also think Baraka, dare I say it, was one
notable exception to the milque-toast buffet proffered there. And as
wonderful as our independent bookstores are, they are woefully lacking in
shelf space for experimental works- or they purchase a few copies which sell
out quickly and are not replaced. And they don't really sell any
journals/mags of interest. Unless Granta or Poetry really grabs you.

Access to whom? To people like me. Since it really is such an egocentric
thread depending on your viewpoint and, perhaps, your access. One has to be
rather wily to gain information locally about events at the academy here. An
ivy tower. Which tends to keep pretty much to itself. One has to be pretty
wily to seek out and cultivate discussion among individuals from different
camps- scabacious adjunct that I am, I often have to procure books thru ILL,
and they often come from another state school- NOT the lovely ivy wrapped
library here, or was that ivory wrapped. So, you can see, it is a little
personal. There is also the whole arena of grants, grant-making, who decides
that and how and I have been heavily involved in collaborating AMONG people
from different camps, selfishly perhaps, because it influences what I think
about and write about. So. Access matters tremendously to me. It also
matters for many other highly personal reasons of class, gender and
education that I'd prefer not to pick apart in a public forum, but I think
you get the gist. Gosh, I'd love to get a PhD, but at this point, it's a
matter of whose education matters more- my education or my child's?

Originally this piece (GogolChat by Christophe Bruno) was conceived as a
multi-user chat where a fictitious character, named Gogol, lives.

This character has a mythical status, since his speech tends towards the su=
m
of all speeches of mankind.

Gogol IS the web.

After the completion of this work, the chat was "infiltrated" by jimpunk.
Since then a quasi-permanent happening shifts the chat beyond the dimension
of meaning and communication.

Finally GogolChat became a collaborative piece mixing a purely textual
work - the original GogolChat - with scripts and visuals changed by Jimpunk
live.

I don't agree at all, but who cares, I like this writing, so tough, so cool,
like Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity (1944)...

reason for me to understand this at all - that the multiple practices you
do - they relate - when you die, there will be all these tatters - yiddish

interstitial - you'll find it - don't give up - always looking - the
pieces fit together - immersive/definable - sheffer stroke and its dual -
defuge - distributed avatars - evanescence - it's all there - the others
come to me - at night - the codeine doesn't keep them away - they'll
gather the materials - distributive philosophy - reconstruct what you
deconstruct - scaffolding - i'm not there yet, i'm getting there - the
sexuality for one thing inverts the body - the mind - brings everything to
the surface - exfoliations, multiple-connections - mobius surfaces -
topography of the body might be any landscape - think of northern sung
painting - either multiple or no perspectives - thwarted or borderline
landscape -part coalesce - come together - superimpositions, gestures -
coherencies - the punctured text - perforations - sprockets - the film is
running again - auto- or self-inscription - classical geometries of jordan
curvatures - within or without - punctured texts - of inspiration or
respiration - beneath the sign of extinction - the imminence of such - the
holocaust of wind - inconceivable fragility of the good - the world of
pure slaughter - self-slaughter of mass organisms - final breathing of
warriors of extinctions - policy of scorched worlds - mindfulness and the
clear face - fractal paths through measure geometries - construction of
objects by means of paths - appearances of high-speed protocols -
turbulence and animals, as if the world stands still - appearance of
objects within such a world - for that matter aristotelian logics,
regularized laws of distribution - beginnings of the contracts among
organs and objects - organisms and neighborhoods - writing the unbearable

philosophy as travel writing - gravitation towards taxonomies -

or the other - coherencies, syncopation - it begins with any distinction,
moves through any distinction - of sexualities, the tumor or cancer - the

i think the original q was which women poets cd/shd have been
included in the Allen anthology, not who were the interesting women
poets writing at the time?  i think we'd all agree that, talented and
fabulous as plath and sexton are, their aesthetic is of a different
orientation than most of the men and women whose work appeared in
TNAP.

"Modicum" is the right word, Jane. I've come to feel that response and
access are very related. The fact is, inside and outside academia, or the
so-called poetry community for that matter, except for the generosity and
kindness of friends, there is precious little actual response of any type,
perhaps except for the very few writers whose long term efforts, usually
including a huge output of books, have paid off unusually well. This is in
fact, very few people indeed, including the writers at the top of the silly
Amazon.com sales rankings, which are relatively insignificant. Better to
check with SPD for the kind of writing read by members of this list. Reviews
are seldom and sparse. Poetry publishers and editors of small magazines and
reviews, electronic and otherwise, deserve a lot of credit for bravely
trying to go against the icy chill and virtually complete lack of monetary
return and mostly meager interest. For Christsakes, frequently I don't get
responses to letters I backchannel to members of this list even when they
have sent out an open call for backchannel information to be sent to them.
As a retiring Senator put it recently: it's a cold world out there. It's
hard not to get bitter and cynical over the long haul about poetry-and
poets, for that matter- but I have to  work hard to not let stormy weather
spoil the experience. This list is mostly helpful in that regard, don't you
think?

I find poetics intersects with art theory and often find it more =
stimulating and often more comrehensible to read art theory or books by =
and or about artists - I dont mean learned dissertations but eg I'm =
currently reading abook by Ellen Johnston on art and the object: a lot =
of it maybe "old hat" or I've even read (some) of it before but it =
stimulates ideas. Also I find that lit crit is the best way for me to =
get philosophic concepts and some poetry is the most revelatory of =
philosophy: and science is the  semi-futile attempt to "explain =
everything"...sub specie aeternitatis it is futile...religion is  "The =
Answer" but I veer back to science when religion "traps" me or tells me =
to worship a Father (or tells me to "join" or "be good" or agree eg that =
there is only one possible universe...) then I rebel against science =
when it traps me into simplistic notions of "progress". When people come =
over too pious and anti-theocratic and laying down universal laws I =
reach for my relativistic gun...

Creation IS murder. In the best sense of the term.

FYI:

From the UNIC web site.

*** Note to Web Site Visitors:***

 We have been receiving emails as part of a petition -- generated by an
unknown source --
  urging the US and international community to refrain from going to
war.  While we were
  heartened by this effort, the United Nations Secretariat (to which we
are employed) is an
  implementing organ for the actions and programs agreed upon and
supported by its 189
                             Member States.

    Therefore, if individuals really want their voices heard by these
decision-makers, they
  should contact their governments and mission to the UN to express
concerns and views.
         (We would discourage mass correspondence through emails
though!).

                   Permanent Missions to the United Nations
    for US Citizens:  US House of Representatives , US Senate and the
White House.

                               Thank you.

A friend forwarded this to me a few days ago so I
checked the site, which reads:

"Note:  We have learned that there is a new petition
circulating that claims to have been started by our
office -- we have not, nor have we ever, initiated any
petition."

<www.unicwash@unicwash.org>

Is the below legit?

Reading
Dodie Bellamy and Douglas Rice
Tuesday 15 Oct 2002
8 pm
New Langton Arts
1246 Folsom Street (between 8th and 9th streets)
San Francisco

Dodie Bellamy and Douglas Rice immerse the reader in an intimacy that
is both tender and explicit, as their writing reimagines the
parameter of fictive discourse. Dodie Bellamy's work collapses the
boundaries between the marketing tools ordinarily thought of as
novel, poem, and punchline. Embodying both violent and confessional
senses of eroticism, her writing aims to represent physical sensation
over sexual experience. Doug Rice combines autobiography, fiction,
theory, and religion to explore the subjects of gender uncertainty
and identity politics. His characters' sense of indeterminacy demands
a different structure of representation, which he expresses through a
language and syntax of his own creation. Combining fact and fiction,
the brutal and the lyric, these writers create experimental,
cross-genre works that break the cultural traditions of confessional
writing, sexual theory, feminism, erotica, and sadomasochism.

Dodie Bellamy's latest book, Cunt-Ups (Tender Buttons, 2002) won the
2002 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Poetry. She has published
numerous books of fiction, poetry, and short stories, and her work
has been widely published in literary journals, magazines, and
anthologies. Her works include Feminine Hijinx (Hanuman, 1990), The
Letters of Mina Harker (Hard Press, 1998) as well as three chap
books. The former director of Small Press Traffic, a Bay Area
nonprofit literary foundation, Bellamy lives in San Francisco, where
she and her partner Kevin Killian publish the cutting-edge
art-literary zine Mirage/Period[ical]. She teaches creative writing
San Francisco State University.

Novelist and theorist Doug Rice is the author of Blood of Mugwump: A
Tiresian Tale of Incest (Black Ice Books, 1996) and A Good CuntBoy is
Hard to Find (CPAOD Books, 1998), and is co-editor of Journey Into
Chaos: A Casebook of the Life and Work of Ray Federman (San Diego
State University Press, 1997). He is a professor of cultural studies
and fiction writing at California State University, Sacramento. His
work has appeared in numerous anthologies including Avant Pop (1993)
and Chick of a Day (2000) and in journals including Plasm (1998),
Fiction International (2002), and Discourse (2002).

that a tape was made and is available from the San Francisco Poetry Center.
Just call 415-338-2227 and a tape can be had that has the complete reading
with Kent and Erin Mour=E9.

A wonderful reading that I thought could have gone on longer!

After which Kent Johnson, myself, and Chris Daniels, the Lusophone
translator of Fernando Pessoa, and wide array of Brazilian poets, along wit=
h
Steve Dickison, the Director of the Center, all headed out to Gino and
Carlo's, Jack Spicer's old haunt, for beers and conversation. (Gino &
Carlo's not in the least resembling any place you'd expect to see Spicer's
ghost, alas!)

Kent read from Doubled Flowering, the Epigrams, a book of Greek
Translations, some of which can be found on the VeRT site, soon to be out o=
f
Skanky Possum, and from Immanent Visitor, a translation of poems from the
Bolivian poet Jaime Saenz. (Immanent Visitor is just out from U of Cal
Press.) A lot of ground to cover, to say the very least.

The turn out was not altogether overwhelming, which seems to be par for the
course in The City these days. Maybe the downturn here has really zapped th=
e
poets... or something?

http://www.dtmgallery.com/

Here's what they had to say about Kenning 12 / WAY - the audio edition in
their latest update:

> KENNING # 12 - The Audio Edition (Small Press Distribution) Kenning
> is a newsletter of contemporary poetry and nonfiction writing.  This

Bad to the funny bone
Purposely awful poetry, karaoke, stand-up find willing participants,
appreciative audiences

Sam McManis, Chronicle Deputy Living Editor, San Francisco
Chronicle       Sunday, October 13, 2002
http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/10/13/
LV190495.DTL#sections
------------------------------------------------------------------------

An anticipatory hush falls over the Blue Room, an avant-garde art
gallery in San Francisco's Mission District, transformed for one night
into a performance poetry space. Plastic folding chairs creak under the
weight of squirming bodies. Someone muffles a cough. A cell-phone bleat
is stifled. The microphone crackles with feedback.

But it is utterly, almost uncomfortably, quiet by the time poet Dave
Hadbawnik finally steps to the microphone. He is dressed up for the
occasion, in a chocolate brown suit without a shred of natural fiber.
This ill-fitting get-up, a '70s creation he found on the sidewalk for 2
bucks, will seem fitting attire in retrospect. No one scoffed at the
shabby suit at the time, though, so engrossed were they in the artist
and his "art."

Hadbawnik begins to read a free-verse masterpiece he wrote two decades
ago, at age 18. Its subject, naturally, is the prom. His delivery is
sincere, impassioned; the poesy earnest, wrenching, straight from the
gut.

"For now let us dance across this wedding cake floor/ Knowing in the
back of our dream drunk minds/ We will talk of this night/ Long after
the helium has seeped out of these cheap balloons."

Nervous titters and chuckles from the audience . . .

"I will spin you round and round until we create our own gravity/ Until
we can't see the lies floating up from the dance floor like signals
from a satellite."

Laughter bounces off the walls . . .

"But we will stand alone, naked/ Shaded by trees of the most luscious
fruit/ Hearing more truth in the silence than in the transient promises
of a serpent's whisper."

Full-throated guffaws, followed by wild applause . . .

This tour de farce, by a published poet with a creative writing degree
from Wayne State University in Detroit, was a highlight of a recent
two-hour festival of bad poetry. Intentionally bad. The wink-wink,
get-the-irony kind of bad. The expose-yourself-to-ridicule-and-laughs
bad. Ten Bay Area poets, some also published novelists with high
literary street cred, shared their clunky castoffs, mangled metaphors
and asinine alliterations for the fun and amusement of an audience that
actually paid to hear it.

Why? Because it's entertaining.

You've heard the expression "It's so bad it's good," right? Well, in
this postmodern, ultra-ironic age, purposely bad performance by both
professional artists and just plain folks seeking outlets of
self-expression has become as hip, as de rigueur, in the Bay Area as
using foreign words to feign sophistication.

Last month's "bad poetry" reading filled the seats and no doubt made
scores of people log on to Amazon.com to find actress Suzanne Somers'
seminal chapbook of free verse, "Touch Me."

At the Odeon bar in the Mission, Monday is Bad Karaoke Night, where the
powerful combination of off-key singers and wretchedly sappy pop tunes
entertains scores until last call. And, appearing somewhere unannounced
on a Muni bus near you, a duo called the Sub-Standard Comix entertains
riders with purposely awful stand-up material -- perhaps to make the
long ride seem even longer.

There's more bad out there. Lots more.


BAD CAN BE GOOD

In Fremont, a laid off dot-commer has found her true calling -- and
significant Web traffic -- by launching a site
(www.miserablemelodies.com) devoted to achingly bad cover versions of
popular songs. And San Jose State's annual salute to purple prose, the
Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, receives scores of really good bad
entries each year. The winners have the media calling them as if they
had won a Pulitzer.

It is not a new concept, by any means. Bad art has been around since,
well, art. Purposely creating it, and taking pleasure from its bitter
fruits, is another matter, though.

Call it a "mirror reversal ethic," says Oakland writer Rephah Berg,
this year's Bulwer-Lytton winner.

"Bad works, done the right way, are funny," Berg said. "Normally we
expect people to perform adequately at whatever they're doing. If they
don't, a conflict exists between expectation and reality. That conflict
can be exploited for the sake of humor."

Or, put another way, it's fun to mock the talentless. Even if it's
yourself.

"It's a post-irony thing," said Michael Smoler, one of the organizers
of the Bad Poetry night. "You've got to get to the other side of irony
because it can become too fixed. Doing a bad reading is just breaking
the monolith of taste. Art and poetry aren't there to tell people
what's good."

Perhaps, but people know bad when they see it.

"I asked my brother, Greg, why people knowingly seek out bad movies,
etc., and he replied, 'Because people like to look at accidents,' "
said Sean Finney,

one of the poets featured at the event. "I see it as a way for people
to communicate."


THEN THERE'S JEWEL

At the start of the poetry event, Smoler pointed to a table where a
copy of turgid poems by pop princess Jewel was on display. The crowd
laughed, ready to mock her as they later would the Somers offering. But
Smoler gave the elite audience something to think about.

"OK, Jewel's poetry -- but is it really bad?" he asked. "Maybe it saved
somebody's life once. Maybe a girl didn't slit her wrists, and so
that's good, right? Another question: Do we, as poets, need to be
invited to be bad?"

Bad is subjective, of course. The line between sentiment and schmaltz
can be thin and ever changing. Andrew Felsinger, a poet and editor of
the online art magazine VeRT, devoted an entire issue to the subject of
bad art. He read a few of the poems he published in his magazine, to
howls of laughter from the audience. But when Felsinger told the crowd
in advance that his next line was written by Walt Whitman -- "Through
the scent of armpits in an aroma finer than prayer . . ." -- the
audience remained respectfully quiet.

"If it had been me who had uttered those words without the Whitman
(attribution), it would have almost brought the house down," Felsinger
said.

It wasn't all smirking irony at the poetry event. Hadbawnik said that
the event showed the "doubt and uncertainty" some of the city's best
poets feel, how a well-intentioned poem can go bad. The poets can "get
bogged down in the sentiment or the ego or trying too hard, which can
be beautiful in its own way. "

Hadbawnik said that even bad poetry has value because it's sincere. He
had to look no farther than his high-school masterpiece about prom
night.

"When I wrote it, if someone had laughed at it the way people were, I
would've been crushed," he said. "It was not written to be bad or funny
-- which makes it even funnier, I know. . . . In the unintentional
comedy of it you could also be touched or moved by the sincerity, the
naivete."


GROANERS ON MUNI

Insincerity, however, oozed across town at the intentionally bad
stand-up comedy gig. San Francisco resident Al Cummings, the mastermind
behind the Sub- Standard Comix, says he and his anti-comedic troupe
want to anger "people who are expecting a high standard and convince
people that anyone can do this and this is a fun part of it, also."

Last spring, Cummings and pals, fueled by several drinks called
Chernobyls (Mountain Dew and vodka), stood up in a crowded Muni
31-Balboa bus and told awful jokes that elicited groans and perverse
laughter. Example: "How do crazy people go through the forest? They
take the psycho path."

Cummings' art may have been lost on some Muni passengers. But he
recently did a set at a nightclub on California Street, and, he said,
people "got" his willful badness. Cummings pointed to the cult success
of anti-comic comic Neil Hamburger -- who purposely tries to be bad and
succeeds every time, and even has had a few decent-selling CDs -- as
the template for awful stand-up.

"I mean, we label ourselves 'substandard' so people will know,"
Cummings said. "It's an ironic play on the whole stand-up thing."

At the Odeon bar, where Monday nights are dedicated to bad karaoke --
on- key singing is forbidden -- irony is scoured away. The participants
are free to belt out a tune as agonizingly out of tune as they dare,
without fear of mockery.

D.J. Paul DeJong has hosted the bad karaoke for the past three months,
and he knows what you're thinking: Isn't all karaoke bad karaoke? Yes,
but he gives people permission not to even strive for mediocrity.

"We're not mocking the people singing at all," he said. "It's more
interactive. People will join in to help someone struggling through a
song. It's refreshing to have someone step out of their normal role.
Some karaoke singer who had really practiced and is good, that's just
not as entertaining."

Karaoke crooner Scott Mary, who performed a dicey version of Elvis'
"Teddy Bear," said he liked the Odeon's noncompetitive style.

"I feel intimidated at most karaoke places because everyone's going to
take you seriously," Mary said. "I lived in Nashville this past summer,
and you had people seriously trying to get discovered at karaoke bars.
I like this type of atmosphere because it's a human performing. You see
the screwups and the real emotion."


B MOVIES AND BEYOND

Amateurs such as the Odeon's singers can be excused for singing poorly
and accepted as entertainment on a benign level. But when celebrities
produce truly bad works, it seems more satisfying for regular folks to
mock. The Internet is chock full of sites devoted to B movies and the
Ed Wood oeuvre.

That was the thinking behind Fremont resident Marion Briones' Web site
dedicated to butchered songs, ones that started with good intentions
but ended horribly. She pores over old vinyls at Rasputin Records,
looking for gems such as William Shatner "singing" the Beatles' "Lucy
in the Sky With Diamonds." She's built up quite a collection, too, and
shares them on her site, which she says averages about 1,000 hits a day.

"My husband asks me how I can listen to this stuff," Briones said. "I'm
(a) classically trained (singer) and perfectly pitched. I don't know,
it just strikes a funny nerve in me. Other people like it, too. To me,
it wouldn't be funny if they were trying to be bad. But here we have
pros who go into the studio and think they're producing real art."

Briones said that last year she received an e-mail from a woman in
Bosnia saying she appreciated the laughs.

"Another woman went into premature labor when she heard my copy of this
frail, elderly German woman named Gerty Molzen singing Lou Reed's 'Take
a Walk on the Wild Side,' " Briones said. "Wait until people hear my
latest find -- my father has an album of old San Francisco 49ers
singing holiday songs. It's a classic."

Perhaps. But it will have a hard time beating out San Francisco fiction
writer Beth Lisick's interpretation of Suzanne Somers' musings:

"Touch me in winter, when darkness comes early and softness of fur
surrounds my face/ Touch me not like a cat/ Or a tree or even a flower/
For I am more than all of these, but akin to them/ Touch me, I am a
poet, a woman."
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bad stages

Bad entertainment, it seems, can be separated into three subgenres:

-- The Elbow-in-the-Ribs Bad, wherein entertainers intentionally
produce putrid performances to mock established norms of what's high
and low art.
-- The Scrape-Away-Irony-and-Expectation Bad, wherein regular zhlubs
liberate themselves from trying to be hip and professional and just let
loose.
-- The Professionally-Bad-as-Enjoyable, wherein pretentions of
celebrities are pricked and their lame attempts to cross over into a
genre not their own are mercilessly mocked.

A few thoughts:

Code is to the new media poet as language is to a lyric poet.  Mouseovers
can become metaphor, Javascripts can create assonance -- a new media poet=B9s
primary expressive tool is the code s/he has written, acquired, adopted,
recombined, modified, made her/his own.

If poetry is the language art, to quote Marjorie Perloff, then I think code
is the tool we wield to make that art.  We become as comfortable handling i=
t

From a sociological point of view, I think we have to conclude that poetry's subordination to the academy has been bad for both departments of the culture.  I say "sociological point of view" because I want to refer not to the unique cases but to the general levels of competence in each field.

It is obvious, for example, that few college teachers know or care about the poetry of our time.  They perceive it as being just another professional sub-specialty.  The handful of scholars who do interest themselves in contemporary poetry tend, therefore, to wield undeserved influence over professional opinion -- just like the handfuls of scholars who work, for example, on Old Norse or the history of silent film.  This would be as if scholars of music listened only to the music they studied.

As for the quality of contemporary poetry, we can assert with some confidence that its weaknesses, in general, reflect a desire to conform to academic preconceptions about the "poetic" (and about "language").  The MFA mandarins instill their norms of poetry writing (colloquial, expressive), and the theory-driven mandarins assert theirs (paratactic, ambiguously expressive) -- and all the time most college teachers are either ill-informed or indifferent, so it is not even true that a future audience is being created.  (And ironically the teachers who are most committed to literature -- those in the community colleges -- work with the students least likely to read after graduating.)

If you have the necessary detachment, you can appreciate the absurdity of this situation.  But it seems important, at this stage, to keep a positive outlook on what can be done to change it (enough of my carping).  Thus far, we have heard articulate support expressed by Mark Wallace and Gary Sullivan for small presses, and also (by Jeffrey Jullich) for more honest and thoughtful reviewing.  Again, sociologically speaking, both of these ideas point toward the establishment of a more independent poetic culture.  Personally, I'm cheered by this prospect, and would like to hear more such discussion.

Uh, Jen, don't you think you ought to make it clear you are speaking for
yourself?

You're certainly not speaking for me ...

Just which code are we talking about? Microsoft's, for instance? The poet's
code is what percent of the total code involved in bringing you a new media
poem -- .00001% perhaps? I think we need to be pretty careful here. This
all gets very very very complicated.

I prefer the statement that *WORDS* are to the new media poet as words are
to the lyric poet.

Code is there, now, in the toolkit, as an *option*. To insist that code
tools are more than just an option is an aggressive assertion with which
reasonable people will differ.

I for one am uncomfortable with making other poets uncomfortable over the
fact that they're not comfortable with tools like javascript -- which is a
rather bad programming language, by the way -- the poet *shouldn't have to
write code*. The fact that new media poets do have to write some small bits
of code (a program under 10,000 lines of code counts as small -- and yes, I
have written some systems that are not small -- I wrote an entire word
processor once) is simply a testimony to the fact that the current
generation of tools is not serving us very well. If we had the right tools,
the poet would have to write no code at all.

There are painters who get us to look at the stretcher as part of what they
do. There are painters who don't want us to think about the stretcher. The
only one who is "wrong" is the dogmatist who insists there is only one way
to think about this.

Don't you think we should have the same attitude toward code?

My view is: the best code is the code the poet doesn't have to write at
all, and the second best code is the code that is *disappearable*. Others
will disagree, of course.

In the end, it's the words that matter, as they always have.

HI
Would any of you great poets care to explain why certain practitioners of
the poetic art choose to put all of those different indentation levels in
their work? You know what I mean, like this:

        the visible

as in the past

        subsisting in layered zone

                        refuses to dangle

                 oaths on marsh field
[etc.]

(Barbara Guest)

I have my own autodidactically formed ideas on the subject that may be way
off insofar as I have never come upon a good solid reason as to why such a
multiplicity of indentations -- (or rather, a la Guest, blurred edges) --
are there or what purpose they serve in moving the poem along. I must say,
though, if nothing else that it does make a poem look staunchly modern and
damn fine, and perhaps has something deeply to do with Olson's notion of
field, but beyond that I am not quite sure. Also, does anybody know who was
the first to employ this sort of thing, and has it arguably become somewhat
done to death by now?

Excuse me if this is a question that the academy has, like, written reams
about without my knowing. I am one who prefers the bohemian life to a desk
job, so I hope one will excuse the gaping holes in my knowledge as well as
my pants.

There are all kinds of historical examples of line placement,
something as simple as a

            line
            break,

                        coupling of lines,
                        reinforcement of

rhyme patterning,
        indentation,

beginning of new thought,

                                                            concrete
                                                            poems

going back several hundred years,
            haiku,

any positioning     at any time     in literary time

                is as much a part of line placement
               as any present idea of field

    in this time, or what might follow,

                    if you like,

    it's not mere fashion or decoration,
                    though might be used for either,

so arguably it can't be overdone
as long as there is another breath taken,

               mind, eye, sound                 movement,
                                                    broken
                                                                thought,
resumption,

idea willing to stand on it's own,
or lean on another,

                    verse,
                        rhythm,

                    bent

Andy,
   I really don't understand what you are talking about? Is that because we
live in different countries? You refer to 'fields' --which fields do you
live in? I live in a city. You refer to the academy? Which academy, where?
You refer to sociology, what kind of sociology? You speak in the third
person, who are the others that make you so plural?

Nick and Jane,

     I realized after sending my last post I was really talking about (or
trying to talk about) more of a personal access kind of question.  A short
while back a reader (who happens to be a professor of communication) brought
it to my attention that a lot of my work related to the dilemma of not
communicating while saying that I am trying to communicate.  I can see this
more readily in Beckett and I suspect this ambivalence might be
characteristic of many poets.

ambivalently speaking, that is,

I too have also wondered about it: I agree it correlates with Olson's ideaas
but also it goes back to mallarke's famous "The First throow of a Dice..."
which is invarious things and you may know also in "Poems for the Millenium"
by Rothenberg and Joris. It took me a long time to  stop writing in the
"mormative " poetic form and only my "The Infinite Poem" did I "go crazy"
and i recall once showing a poem (it wasnt a very good poem) to Wystan
Curnow at areading and he said: "Ewww, its in lines!" which was fair enough.
It in fact took me a while to use lower case and in fact I can only surmie
hat that is 1) Habit (enculturation)  of which subject certainly Murat and
George B will enlighten you greatly 2) to some extent (via Habit) it is a
kind of conservative  so 1) and 2) are linked but I often wondered. Why the
indentations adn why should they go "herre"rather" than there.  I came to
use it sometimes (if I wasnt doing "block-shaped" prose poems to allow space
(and also because a lot of other poets I saw were doing it hence
Enculturation (not necessarily "bad") and also for poems where we have a lot
of words on their own the disjunctions interact with possible conjunctions
(parataxis etc)... also in Williams the "stepping down" someties 'echoes" or
complements the "movement" of the poem.

The other question is also of course "why not?" but I like your question:
its something that's 'nagged' me for a while. Nick Piombino, Al Sond,
Barratt Watten , Amnselm Hollo, or R Silliman or any of innumerabe others
may wish to reply at this jucncture. Richard Taylor.

I agree here with jennifer...just want to add this....

it's funny, i was just thinking about this earlier
this evening...talked to august highland on the phone
saturday night, and he got me thinking about the
schism that is often perceived between "coders" &
"creatives"=====coders like hard logic, while
creatives are, well, creative...deena larsen i also
believe in a chat at trAce brought up the point, well,
it's come to the point where we're asking poets to
blend image text and sound, isn't it a bit much to ask
them to program to?
my thoughts? no, it's not too much...in fact, the
artist in the future will blend all of this quite
easily...(she already is, all over places like rhizome
and furtherfield)...me, i love code...& i love
poetry...& they're not different from each other,
y'know...before i created "new media" works, i often
thought of the poem as an emotional little computer
program...we code incessantly, all the time, it's just
not always "machine code" (neither is the code we use
to get the machine to do what we want, really...the
machine only understands ones and zeroes, on and
off)....semiotics is the study of the codes we
use...linguistics studies a code...IT'S ALL CODE...

so, essentially, it's important not simply because
it's our brush, but also because we were doing it
before we even picked up this particular brush...you
were too...in fact, you're doing it right now...
bliss
l



JENNIFER:A few thoughts:

Code is to the new media poet as language is to a
lyric poet.  Mouseovers
can become metaphor, Javascripts can create assonance
-- a new media poet¹s
primary expressive tool is the code s/he has written,
acquired, adopted,
recombined, modified, made her/his own.

If poetry is the language art, to quote Marjorie
Perloff, then I think code
is the tool we wield to make that art.  We become as
comfortable handling it
as any painter does a brush.  But beyond that, code,
bits and bytes of it,
can become our rhyme scheme, our cadence, our iambic
pentameter or, just as
importantly the antithesis of any of these poetic
conventions, the means by
which digital language can become digital
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E.

I went to lunch with Donald Allen yesterday and asked him why, for
example, Muriel Rukeyser wasn't one of the poets he included in "The
New American Poetry."  Was it because, as some have speculated, he
considered her part of the "1.5" generation which included Patchen,
Zukofsky, Rexroth.  "No," he replied.  "I just never thought much of
her work.  She was everything the book was supposed to be against.  I
had met her in Berkeley, but got to know her after I met Octavio Paz,
first in Mexico City, then in New York.  He wanted me to publish
Rukeyser's translations of his poems.  I thought they were awful."
Her own poetry?  "Does she have her partisans?"  "I'm one," I flared
out.  "I mean, she's good and she's bad.  We all have our ups and
downs."  He considered.  We were at Benihana and the chef was
throwing things up in the air and stabbing them with knives then
pinning them down on a big hot steel table and the steam was hissing
like mad.  "Bit of a sentimentalist."  Afterwards I thought, but yet
look at our dear John Wieners and he was a bit of a sentimentalist
and what was wrong with that?  But, it was all so long ago and far
away.  It's hard to transport oneself back to another time.

Utopian Plagiarism, Hypertextuality, and Electronic
Cultural Production

 The Critical Art Ensemble




Plagiarism has long been considered an evil in the
cultural world. Typically it has been viewed
as the theft of language, ideas, and images by the
less than talented, often for the enhancement of
personal fortune or prestige. Yet, like most
mythologies, the myth of plagiarism is easily
inverted. Perhaps it is those who support the
legislation of representation and the privatization of
language that are suspect; perhaps the plagiarist's
actions, given a specific set of social
conditions, are the ones contributing most to cultural
enrichment. Prior to the Enlightenment,
plagiarism was useful in aiding the distribution of
ideas. An English poet could appropriate and
translate a sonnet from Petrarch and call it his own.
In accordance with the classical aesthetic of
art as imitation, this was a perfectly acceptable
practice. The real value of this activity rested less
in the reinforcement of classical aesthetics than in
the distribution of work to areas where
otherwise it probably would not have appeared. The
works of English plagiarists, such as
Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, Sterne, Coleridge, and
De Quincey, are still a vital part of the
English heritage, and remain in the literary canon to
this day.
At present, new conditions have emerged that once
again make plagiarism an acceptable, even
crucial strategy for textual production. This is the
age of the recombinant: recombinant bodies,
recombinant gender, recombinant texts, recombinant
culture. Looking back through the
privileged frame of hindsight, one can argue that the
recombinant has always been key in the
development of meaning and invention; recent
extraordinary advances in electronic technology
have called attention to the recombinant both in
theory and in practice (for example, the use of
morphing in video and film). The primary value of all
electronic technology, especially
computers and imaging systems, is the startling speed
at which they can transmit information in
both raw and refined forms. As information flows at a
high velocity through the electronic
networks, disparate and sometimes incommensurable
systems of meaning intersect, with both
enlightening and inventive consequences. In a society
dominated by a "knowledge" explosion,
exploring the possibilities of meaning in that which
already exists is more pressing than adding
redundant information (even if it is produced using
the methodology and metaphysic of the
"original"). In the past, arguments in favor of
plagiarism were limited to showing its use in
resisting the privatization of culture that serves the
needs and desires of the power elite. Today
one can argue that plagiarism is acceptable, even
inevitable, given the nature of postmodern
existence with its techno-infrastructure. In a
recombinant culture, plagiarism is productive,
although we need not abandon the romantic model of
cultural production which privileges a
model of ex nihilo creation. Certainly in a general
sense the latter model is somewhat
anachronistic. There are still specific situations
where such thinking is useful, and one can never
be sure when it could become appropriate again. What
is called for is an end to its tyranny and to
its institutionalized cultural bigotry. This is a call
to open the cultural data base, to let everyone
use the technology of textual production to its
maximum potential.
"Ideas improve. The meaning of words participates in
the improvement. Plagiarism is necessary.
Progress implies it. It embraces an author's phrase,
makes use of his expressions, erases a false
idea, and replaces it with the right idea."(1)
Plagiarism often carries a weight of negative
connotations (particularly in the bureaucratic class);
while the need for its use has increased over the
century, plagiarism itself has been camouflaged
in a new lexicon by those desiring to explore the
practice as method and as a legitimized form of
cultural discourse. Readymades, collage, found art or
found text, intertexts, combines,
detournment, and appropriation - all these terms
represent explorations in plagiarism. Indeed,
these terms are not perfectly synonymous, but they all
intersect a set of meanings primary to the
philosophy and activity of plagiarism.
Philosophically, they all stand in opposition to
essentialist
doctrines of the text: They all assume that no
structure within a given text provides a universal
and necessary meaning. No work of art or philosophy
exhausts itself in itself alone, in its beingin-
itself. Such works have always stood in relation to
the actual life-process of society from
which they have distinguished themselves.
Enlightenment essentialism failed to provide a unit of
analysis that could act as a basis of meaning. Just as
the connection between a signifier and its
referent is arbitrary, the unit of meaning used for
any given textual analysis is also arbitrary.
Roland Barthes' notion of the lexia primarily
indicates surrender in the search for a basic unit of
meaning. Since language was the only tool available
for the development of metalanguage, such
a project was doomed from its inception. It was much
like trying to eat soup with soup. The text
itself is fluid - although the language game of
ideology can provide the illusion of stability,
creating blockage by manipulating the unacknowledged
assumptions of everyday life.
Consequently, one of the main goals of the plagiarist
is to restore the dynamic and unstable drift
of meaning, by appropriating and recombining fragments
of culture. In this way, meanings can
be produced that were not previously associated with
an object or a given set of objects.
Marcel Duchamp, one of the first to understand the
power of recombination, presented an early
incarnation of this new aesthetic with his readymade
series. Duchamp took objects to which he
was "visually indifferent," and recontextualized them
in a manner that shifted their meaning. For
example, by taking a urinal out of the rest room,
signing it, and placing it on a pedestal in an art
gallery, meaning slid away from the apparently
exhaustive functional interpretation of the object.
Although this meaning did not completely disappear, it
was placed in harsh juxtaposition to
another possibility - meaning as an art object. This
problem of instability increased when
problems of origin were raised: The object was not
made by an artist, but by a machine. Whether
or not the viewer chose to accept other possibilities
for interpreting the function of the artist and
the authenticity of the art object, the urinal in a
gallery instigated a moment of uncertainty and
reassessment. This conceptual game has been replayed
numerous times over the 20th century, at
times for very narrow purposes, as with Rauschenberg's
combines - done for the sake of
attacking the critical hegemony of Clement Greenberg -
while at other times it has been done to
promote large-scale political and cultural
restructuring, as in the case of the Situationists. In
each
case, the plagiarist works to open meaning through the
injection of scepticism into the culturetext.
Here one also sees the failure of Romantic
essentialism. Even the alleged transcendental object
cannot escape the sceptics' critique. Duchamp's notion
of the inverted readymade (turning a
Rembrandt painting into an ironing board) suggested
that the distinguished art object draws its
power from a historical legitimation process firmly
rooted in the institutions of western culture,
and not from being an unalterable conduit to
transcendental realms. This is not to deny the
possibility of transcendental experience, but only to
say that if it does exist, it is prelinguistic,
and thereby relegated to the privacy of an
individual's subjectivity. A society with a complex
division of labor requires a rationalization of
institutional processes, a situation which in turn
robs the individual of a way to share nonrational
experience. Unlike societies with a simple
division of labor, in which the experience of one
member closely resembles the experience of
another (minimal alienation), under a complex division
of labor, the life experience of the
individual turned specialist holds little in common
with other specialists. Consequently,
communication exists primarily as an instrumental
function. Plagiarism has historically stood
against the privileging of any text through spiritual,
scientific, or other legitimizing myths. The
plagiarist sees all objects as equal, and thereby
horizontalizes the plane of phenomena. All texts
become potentially usable and reusable. Herein lies an
epistemology of anarchy, according to
which the plagiarist argues that if science, religion,
or any other social institution precludes
certainty beyond the realm of the private, then it is
best to endow consciousness with as many
categories of interpretation as possible. The tyranny
of paradigms may have some useful
consequences (such as greater efficiency within the
paradigm), but the repressive costs to the
individual (excluding other modes of thinking and
reducing the possibility of invention) are too
high. Rather than being led by sequences of signs, one
should instead drift through them,
choosing the interpretation best suited to the social
conditions of a given situation.
"It is a matter of throwing together various cut-up
techniques in order to respond to the
omnipresence of transmitters feeding us with their
dead discourses (mass media, publicity, etc.).
It is a question of unchaining the codes - not the
subject anymore - so that something will burst
out, will escape; words beneath words, personal
obsessions. Another kind of word is born which
escapes from the totalitarianism of the media but
retains their power, and turns it against their old
masters."
Cultural production, literary or otherwise, has
traditionally been a slow, labor-intensive process.
In painting, sculpture, or written work, the
technology has always been primitive by
contemporary standards. Paintbrushes, hammers and
chisels, quills and paper, and even the
printing press do not lend themselves well to rapid
production and broad-range distribution. The
time lapse between production and distribution can
seem unbearably long. Book arts and
traditional visual arts still suffer tremendously from
this problem, when compared to the
electronic arts. Before electronic technology became
dominant, cultural perspectives developed
in a manner that more clearly defined texts as
individual works. Cultural fragments appeared in
their own right as discrete units, since their
influence moved slowly enough to allow the orderly
evolution of an argument or an aesthetic. Boundaries
could be maintained between disciplines
and schools of thought. Knowledge was considered
finite, and was therefore easier to control. In
the 19th century this traditional order began to
collapse as new technology began to increase the
velocity of cultural development. The first strong
indicators began to appear that speed was
becoming a crucial issue. Knowledge was shifting away
from certitude, and transforming itself
into information. During the American Civil War,
Lincoln sat impatiently by his telegraph line,
awaiting reports from his generals at the front. He
had no patience with the long-winded rhetoric
of the past, and demanded from his generals an
efficient economy of language. There was no
time for the traditional trappings of the elegant
essayist. Cultural velocity and information have
continued to increase at a geometric rate since then,
resulting in an information panic. Production
and distribution of information (or any other product)
must be immediate; there can be no lag
time between the two. Techno-culture has met this
demand with data bases and electronic
networks that rapidly move any type of information.
Under such conditions, plagiarism fulfills the
requirements of economy of representation,
without stifling invention. If invention occurs when a
new perception or idea is brought out - by
intersecting two or more formally disparate systems -
then recombinant methodologies are
desirable. This is where plagiarism progresses beyond
nihilism. It does not simply inject
scepticism to help destroy totalitarian systems that
stop invention; it participates in invention,
and is thereby also productive. The genius of an
inventor like Leonardo da Vinci lay in his ability
to recombine the then separate systems of biology,
mathematics, engineering, and art. He was
not so much an originator as a synthesizer. There have
been few people like him over the
centuries, because the ability to hold that much data
in one's own biological memory is rare.
Now, however, the technology of recombination is
available in the computer. The problem now
for would-be cultural producers is to gain access to
this technology and information. After all,
access is the most precious of all privileges, and is
therefore strictly guarded, which in turn
makes one wonder whether to be a successful
plagiarist, one must also be a successful hacker.
"Most serious writers refuse to make themselves
available to the things that technology is doing.
I have never been able to understand this sort of
fear. Many are afraid of using tape recorders,
and the idea of using any electronic means for
literary or artistic purposes seems to them some
sort of sacrilege."
To some degree, a small portion of technology has
fallen through the cracks into the hands of the
lucky few. Personal computers and video cameras are
the best examples. To accompany these
consumer items and make their use more versatile,
hypertextual and image sampling programs
have also been developed - programs designed to
facilitate recombination. It is the plagiarist's
dream to be able to call up, move, and recombine text
with simple user-friendly commands.
Perhaps plagiarism rightfully belongs to post-book
culture, since only in that society can it be
made explicit what book culture, with its geniuses and
auteurs, tends to hide - that information is
most useful when it interacts with other information,
rather than when it is deified and presented
in a vacuum.
Thinking about a new means for recombining information
has always been on 20th-century
minds, although this search has been left to a few
until recently. In 1945 Vannevar Bush, a
former science advisor to Franklin D. Roosevelt,
proposed a new way of organizing information
in an Atlantic Monthly article. At that time, computer
technology was in its earliest stages of
development and its full potential was not really
understood. Bush, however, had the foresight to
imagine a device he called the Memex. In his view it
would be based around storage of
information on microfilm, integrated with some means
to allow the user to select and display any
section at will, thus enabling one to move freely
among previously unrelated increments of
information.
At the time, Bush's Memex could not be built, but as
computer technology evolved, his idea
eventually gained practicality. Around 1960 Theodor
Nelson made this realization when he
began studying computer programming in college:
"Over a period of months, I came to realize that,
although programmers structured their data
hierarchically, they didn't have to. I began to see
the computer as the ideal place for making
interconnections among things accessible to people.
I realized that writing did not have to be sequential
and that not only would tomorrow's books
and magazines be on [cathode ray terminal] screens,
they could all tie to one another in every
direction. At once I began working on a program
(written in 7090 assembler language) to carry
out these ideas." Nelson's idea, which he called
hypertext, failed to attract any supporters at first,
although by 1968 its usefulness became obvious to some
in the government and in defense
industries. A prototype of hypertext was developed by
another computer innovator, Douglas
Englebart, who is often credited with many
breakthroughs in the use of computers (such as the
development of the Macintosh interface, Windows).
Englebart's system, called Augment, was
applied to organizing the government's research
network, ARPAnet, and was also used by
McDonnell Douglas, the defense contractor, to aid
technical work groups in coordinating
projects such as aircraft design:
"All communications are automatically added to the
Augment information base and linked, when
appropriate, to other documents. An engineer could,
for example, use Augment to write and
deliver electronically a work plan to others in the
work group. The other members could then
review the document and have their comments linked to
the original, eventually creating a
"group memory" of the decisions made. Augment's
powerful linking features allow users to find
even old information quickly, without getting lost or
being overwhelmed by detail."
Computer technology continued to be refined, and
eventually - as with so many other
technological breakthroughs in this country - once it
had been thoroughly exploited by military
and intelligence agencies, the technology was released
for commercial exploitation. Of course,
the development of microcomputers and consumer-grade
technology for personal computers led
immediately to the need for software which would help
one cope with the exponential increase in
information, especially textual information. Probably
the first humanistic application of
hypertext was in the field of education. Currently,
hypertext and hypermedia (which adds
graphic images to the network of features which can be
interconnected) continue to be fixtures in
instructional design and educational technology.
An interesting experiment in this regard was
instigated in 1975 by Robert Scholes and Andries
Van Dam at Brown University. Scholes, a professor of
English, was contacted by Van Dam, a
professor of computer science, who wanted to know if
there were any courses in the humanities
that might benefit from using what at the time was
called a text-editing system (now known as a
word processor) with hypertext capabilities built in.
Scholes and two teaching assistants, who
formed a research group, were particularly impressed
by one aspect of hypertext. Using this
program would make it possible to peruse in a
nonlinear fashion all the interrelated materials in a
text. A hypertext is thus best seen as a web of
interconnected materials. This description
suggested that there is a definite parallel between
the conception of culture-text and that of
hypertext:
"One of the most important facets of literature (and
one which also leads to difficulties in
interpretation) is its reflexive nature. Individual
poems constantly develop their meanings - often
through such means as direct allusion or the reworking
of traditional motifs and conventions, at
other times through subtler means, such as genre
development and expansion or biographical
reference - by referring to that total body of poetic
material of which the particular poems
comprise a small segment."
Although it was not difficult to accumulate a
hypertextually-linked data base consisting of poetic
materials, Scholes and his group were more concerned
with making it interactive - that is, they
wanted to construct a "communal text" including not
only the poetry, but also incorporating the
comments and interpretations offered by individual
students. In this way, each student in turn
could read a work and attach "notes" to it about his
or her observations. The resulting "expanded
text" would be read and augmented at a terminal on
which the screen was divided into four areas.
The student could call up the poem in one of the areas
(referred to as windows) and call up
related materials in the other three windows, in any
sequence he or she desired. This would
powerfully reinforce the tendency to read in a
nonlinear sequence. By this means, each student
would learn how to read a work as it truly exists, not
in "a vacuum" but rather as the central point
of a progressively-revealed body of documents and
ideas.
Hypertext is analogous to other forms of literary
discourse besides poetry. From the very
beginning of its manifestation as a computer program,
hypertext was popularly described as a
multidimensional text roughly analogous to the
standard scholarly article in the humanities or
social sciences, because it uses the same conceptual
devices, such as footnotes, annotations,
allusions to other works, quotations from other works,
etc. Unfortunately, the convention of
linear reading and writing, as well as the physical
fact of two-dimensional pages and the
necessity of binding them in only one possible
sequence, have always limited the true potential
of this type of text. One problem is that the reader
is often forced to search through the text (or
forced to leave the book and search elsewhere) for
related information. This is a time-consuming
and distracting process; instead of being able to move
easily and instantly among physically
remote or inaccessible areas of information storage,
the reader must cope with cumbrous
physical impediments to his or her research or
creative work. With the advent of hypertext, it has
become possible to move among related areas of
information with a speed and flexibility that at
least approach finally accommodating the workings of
human intellect, to a degree that books
and sequential reading cannot possibly allow.
"The recombinant text in hypertextual form signifies
the emergence of the perception of textual
constellations that have always/already gone nova. It
is in this uncanny luminosity that the
authorial biomorph has been consumed."(2)
Barthes and Foucault may be lauded for theorizing the
death of the author; the absent author is
more a matter of everyday life, however, for the
technocrat recombining and augmenting
information at the computer or at a video editing
console. S/he is living the dream of capitalism
that is still being refined in the area of
manufacture. The Japanese notion of "just in time
delivery," in which the units of assembly are
delivered to the assembly line just as they are called
for, was a first step in streamlining the tasks of
assembly. In such a system, there is no sedentary
capital, but a constant flow of raw commodities. The
assembled commodity is delivered to the
distributor precisely at the moment of consumer need.
This nomadic system eliminates stockpiles
of goods. (There still is some dead time; however, the
Japanese have cut it to a matter of hours,
and are working on reducing it to a matter of
minutes). In this way, production, distribution, and
consumption are imploded into a single act, with no
beginning or end, just unbroken circulation.
In the same manner, the online text flows in an
unbroken stream through the electronic network.
There can be no place for gaps that mark discrete
units in the society of speed. Consequently,
notions of origin have no place in electronic reality.
The production of the text presupposes its
immediate distribution, consumption, and revision. All
who participate in the network also
participate in the interpretation and mutation of the
textual stream. The concept of the author did
not so much die as it simply ceased to function. The
author has become an abstract aggregate that
cannot be reduced to biology or to the psychology of
personality. Indeed, such a development
has apocalyptic connotations - the fear that humanity
will be lost in the textual stream. Perhaps
humans are not capable of participating in
hypervelocity. One must answer that never has there
been a time when humans were able, one and all, to
participate in cultural production. Now, at
least the potential for cultural democracy is greater.
The single bio-genius need not act as a
stand-in for all humanity. The real concern is just
the same as it has always been: the need for
access to cultural resources.
"The discoveries of postmodern art and criticism
regarding the analogical structures of images
demonstrate that when two objects are brought
together, no matter how far apart their contexts
may be, a relationship is formed. Restricting oneself
to a personal relationship of words is mere
convention. The bringing together of two independent
expressions supersedes the original
elements and produces a synthetic organization of
greater possibility."(3)
The book has by no means disappeared. The publishing
industry continues to resist the
emergence of the recombinant text, and opposes
increases in cultural speed. It has set itself in the
gap between production and consumption of texts, which
for purposes of survival it is bound to
maintain. If speed is allowed to increase, the book is
doomed to perish, along with its renaissance
companions painting and sculpture. This is why the
industry is so afraid of the recombinant text.
Such a work closes the gap between production and
consumption, and opens the industry to
those other than the literary celebrity. If the
industry is unable to differentiate its product
through
the spectacle of originality and uniqueness, its
profitability collapses. Consequently, the industry
plods along, taking years to publish information
needed immediately. Yet there is a peculiar
irony to this situation. In order to reduce speed, it
must also participate in velocity in its most
intense form, that of spectacle. It must claim to
defend "quality and standards," and it must
invent celebrities. Such endeavors require the
immediacy of advertising - that is, full
participation in the simulacra that will be the
industry's own destruction.
Hence for the bureaucrat, from an everyday life
perspective, the author is alive and well. S/he
can be seen and touched and traces of h/is existence
are on the covers of books and magazines
everywhere in the form of the signature. To such
evidence, theory can only respond with the
maxim that the meaning of a given text derives
exclusively from its relation to other texts. Such
texts are contingent upon what came before them, the
context in which they are placed, and the
interpretive ability of the reader. This argument is
of course unconvincing to the social segments
caught in cultural lag. So long as this is the case,
no recognized historical legitimation will
support the producers of recombinant texts, who will
always be suspect to the keepers of "high"
culture.
"Take your own words or the words said to be 'the very
own words' of anyone else living or
dead. You will soon see that words do not belong to
anyone. Words have a vitality of their own.
Poets are supposed to liberate the words - not to
chain them in phrases. Poets have no words 'of
their very own.' Writers do not own their words. Since
when do words belong to anybody? 'Your
very own words' indeed! and who are 'you'?"
The invention of the video portapak in the late 1960s
and early 70s led to considerable
speculation among radical media artists that in the
near future, everyone would have access to
such equipment, causing a revolution in the television
industry. Many hoped that video would
become the ultimate tool for distributable democratic
art. Each home would become its own
production center, and the reliance on network
television for electronic information would be
only one of many options. Unfortunately this prophecy
never came to pass. In the democratic
sense, video did little more than super 8 film to
redistribute the possibility for image production,
and it has had little or no effect on image
distribution. Any video besides home movies has
remained in the hands of an elite technocratic class,
although (as with any class) there are
marginalized segments which resist the media industry,
and maintain a program of
decentralization.
The video revolution failed for two reasons - a lack
of access and an absence of desire. Gaining
access to the hardware, particularly post-production
equipment, has remained as difficult as ever,
nor are there any regular distribution points beyond
the local public access offered by some cable
TV franchises. It has also been hard to convince those
outside of the technocratic class why they
should want to do something with video, even if they
had access to equipment. This is quite
understandable when one considers that media images
are provided in such an overwhelming
quantity that the thought of producing more is empty.
The contemporary plagiarist faces
precisely the same discouragement. The potential for
generating recombinant texts at present is
just that, potential. It does at least have a wider
base, since the computer technology for making
recombinant texts has escaped the technocratic class
and spread to the bureaucratic class;
however, electronic cultural production has by no
means become the democratic form that
utopian plagiarists hope it will be.
The immediate problems are obvious. The cost of
technology for productive plagiarism is still
too high. Even if one chooses to use the less
efficient form of a hand-written plagiarist
manuscript, desktop publishing technology is required
to distribute it, since no publishing house
will accept it. Further, the population in the US is
generally skilled only as receivers of
information, not as producers. With this exclusive
structure solidified, technology and the desire
and ability to use it remain centered in utilitarian
economy, and hence not much time is given to
the technology's aesthetic or resistant possibilities.
In addition to these obvious barriers, there is a more
insidious problem that emerges from the
social schizophrenia of the US. While its political
system is theoretically based on democratic
principles of inclusion, its economic system is based
on the principle of exclusion. Consequently,
as a luxury itself, the cultural superstructure tends
towards exclusion as well. This economic
principle determined the invention of copyright, which
originally developed not in order to
protect writers, but to reduce competition among
publishers. In 17th-century England, where
copyright first appeared, the goal was to reserve for
publishers themselves, in perpetuity, the
exclusive right to print certain books. The
justification, of course, was that when formed into a
literary work, language has the author's personality
imposed upon it, thereby marking it as
private property. Under this mythology, copyright has
flourished in late capital, setting the legal
precedent to privatize any cultural item, whether it
is an image, a word, or a sound. Thus the
plagiarist (even of the technocratic class) is kept in
a deeply marginal position, regardless of the
inventive and efficient uses h/is methodology may have
for the current state of technology and
knowledge.
"What is the point of saving language when there is no
longer anything to say?"
The present requires us to rethink and re-present the
notion of plagiarism. Its function has for too
long been devalued by an ideology with little place in
techno-culture. Let the romantic notions of
originality, genius, and authorship remain, but as
elements for cultural production without
special privilege above other equally useful elements.
It is time to openly and boldly use the
methodology of recombination so as to better parallel
the technology of our time.

just to take up this tiny point; the mfa scene, in my observation, is

"POSSIBILITIES OF POETRY, UPON HER DEATH"
by Evie Shockley   (from The Beloit Poetry Journal)

ars poetica, rough ship, drag
           me from world to brutal word,
                       mental passage. (write.) be
a wail of a sound, surfacing
           to fountain water found in
                       valleys of shadows of breath.
i will brook no evil, for
           thou art not gone, gwen,
                       and poems made of fears
evaporate. when the drops
           dry, scrape gray lines of salt
                       and dreams from brown faces.
(rite.) melt like a verb into
           this rich white earth of paper.
                       grow an oeuvre from a need.

The second book salon of the semester, featuring two poets and scholars,
Burt Kimmelman and Stephen Paul Miller will be held on Wednesday,
October 16th, in Room 5414, CUNY Graduate Center at 365 5th Avenue (at 34th
street), 7 to 9 pm. Refreshments will be served. Hope to see you there!

Burt Kimmelman will read and discuss poetry with a radically objectivist
slant.  His new Marsh Hawk Press book is THE POND AT CAPE MAY POINT.

Stephen Paul Miller's latest book of poetry is THE BEE FLIES IN MAY (Marsh
Hawk Press). He will read from it and discuss his long poem,
"Row," which uses a misinterpretation of Bob Dylan's "Desolation Row" as
a springboard to critique and relate IBM AND THE HOLOCAUST, the idealistic
underpinnings of Alan Turing's universal computing machine, the origins
of capital and anti-semitism, nature as commodity and the financing
of the suburbs, and much else.

I don't know, most of the new media work I see seems so much more
interested in the tool than the things built with the tool.  But
wait, most of the langpo work I see seems so much more interested in
words than the things built with the words.

But, whereas language has been around for a few more years than
something like javascript, I still think most new media artists are
caught up in a lust for the new.  Every new version of Macromedia, or
each new upgrade to a browser, faster processors, more memory... all
of it changes the landscape and the medium through which their works
are made.  It all gives a chance to artists who don't really have
that much talent to make something that seems to be cool and seems to
have complexity or depth, but just plain falls flat.

I think yr missing the mark here.  Of course I can imagine that your
thinking of specific examples & they are most likely a different set of
specific examples from what Im thinking of.  But one has to be quite
careful when separating the content from its electronic physiology.
Any dynamic work which has a heart of code beating beneath the surface,
the work that is interesting to me anyway, is integrated &/so/thus
removing the "text" from body of the piece will generate a separate
text-object which refers to the parent but is other than.

You simply have no idea what your talking about.  Such a generalization
is completely naive.

I work in programs like hypercard (my version is from 1989),
fontographer (my version is from 1991)...  other people like alan s,
ted warnell work in technologies that have literally been around since
the beginning of desktop computing.

just as an email list such as poetics offers anyone the opportunity to
test out thinking that has not been thought thru thoroughly.

<There's no doubt that Plath was a sick puppy. But serious people can

speaks of her "peculiar ability to fuse the domestic and the
hallucinatory.">

I Add 2 cents, in agreement:

The problem with poets who have both talent and a cult of
personality is that the two become hard to unweave . . . so the talent
tends to get swamped in the personality. At least that's true with
Plath, as she remains THE one poet that many people know, or know
of. Works well for her name recognition, but doesn't help her poems
one bit. And several are worth knowing. Even a HUGE, overtaught
one like "Daddy."

On the other hand, I think Sexton is just plain awful. Blather, in fact.

Nah. I put my riding crop in storage after the unpleasantness in
Poughkeepsie. Some people never do stop begging, though, and their name

What about Carol Berg=E9? She was in the hideously titled (and
Jones/Baraka edited) _Four Young Lady Poets_, along with Moraff, Owens,
and Wakoski.

Born 1928, so she's actually six years older than Baraka.

But don't that title say it all?

Watch for the new Microsoft program for the "new media
poetry"- S=O=U=L=L=E=S=S=C=R=A=P 5.0. "New media
poetry"....who were the smart missles who thunk that
one up? How much Kraft macaroni and Wonderbread does
one have to ingest to create the "new media poetry"?
Or does it just happen in front of the PC one day,
after so many mortar shells of Rolling Rock and X
number of hours of "Fear Factor"? Poets have been
blending image, text and sound for at least several
thousand years now, and will continue to do so, with
whatever medium. It doesn't matter how the poem is
made- voice, wax tablet, stone, parchment, paper,
film, computer- it matters what the poem says. A lot
Poetry- especially the academic brand- has been stuck
in the Mire of Form for too long, balkanized by the
committee, dissected in the workshop. Let's create a
poetry of CONTENT WITH MEANING. Where will the "new
media poetry" be when our fine gutless uncivilization
comes crashing down in the not-too-distant future?
Will the "new media poetry" be able to shake, rattle
and roll and bleep, twizzle and sqawk without the
almighty know-nothing internet to run it on? Will the
"new media poetry" be remembered even 25 years from
now, when the dvd it was burned to no longer plays
because it has oxidized?  Perhaps...perhaps, the
coming Sturm und Drang will foster a new age of Art
and Light, an age in which people- even poets- will
have to use the computer they come equipped with at
birth- it's called the brain.

nor prediction, although i have participated in both; it is a careful
extrapolation from the facts, the proliferation of nuclear and biochemical
weapons, increasing world-wide fanaticisms, and exponential depletion of
resources, both natural and artificial. we are witnessing an armageddon
that began millennia ago, the fascination with divinely-given truths that
efface all other considerations. my writing is the writing of the apocal-
ypse, and it is the reading of the apocalypse as well. the filters have
become the content; we are doomed, just as we continue to be doomed to
play out our literary games among the havoc.

allowing the flow of oxygen around an 18" diameter area. the active
blanket has a small pump, warming incoming air to the interior temperature
- the effect is a slow movement of air throughout. the sondheim patent
blanket serves the function of a small blanket placed over a cat; it
creates a womb-like environment, cutting back light and sound, warming the

Well, I dashed off an email too quickly... Here's bit more
clarification on my thoughts:

I didn't really distinguish between algorithmically created
text/image versus dynamic/"live" new media work.  And, yes, the
integrated work (code and the thing(s) the code makes) is much more
interesting to me, too.

Most recently, I saw a series of works (I wish I could remember the
name) that was each artist's interpretation of a connection of three
points, or a triangulation.  The work was prefaced with the code that
created the work.  One in particular, actually showed and hilighted
the code in one frame while what it made was being displayed in
another.  I played/watched with that work for a long time..

I also really enjoyed the the grid of images/texts that you created
with Maria Damon.  I tried to re-locate it just now but it seems the
pages weren't alive.

Both of these works I see as very beautiful, multi-faceted works that
balance quite nicely the content and the user's opportunities to
interact with the content and create new presentations of it and to
create their own meaning from it.

Yes, it was a generalization.  And a stupid one at that.  Though, I'd
like to think that I at least know what I know, having looked at a
lot of the stuff coming through rhizome.net.  My frustration, and
hence my unwarranted attack on the majority of new media artists, was
that I have seen a lot of work that does some nifty things, but only
for the sake of its niftiness (or so it seems, and in some cases I'm
probably wrong).

Yes, and I have liked most of yours and Alan's works.  Maybe I've
just seen way too many bad works and have over-generalized.

Exactly.  And here I am thinking out some more thoughts.  I shouldn't
be so harsh on things I don't like or am frustrated with.  It's
similar to the recent threads on whether its "right" for critics to
write negative reviews.  I'm much more inclined to think that talking
positively about works is more constructive and will move the whole
field forward.

Thanks for the continued dialogue...

I'm enjoying this discussion regarding the new media poetry and would like
to hear more about it. Yet I have questions about the final aphorism here.
In the end, do words matter so much? Getting close to finality, to the core
of experience, isn't it thoughts and feelings that matter? Yesterday I
attended a magic lantern performance by Ken Jacobs- 90 minutes of pure
visual abstraction with music, no words at all. This was at the Avant-Garde
Film Festival, part of the  New York Film Festival, this section at Lincoln
Center's Walter Reade theater with comfortable seats and a big screen, a
packed crowd, many or most of whom, it seemed, were filmmakers. In the
program notes Ken Jacobs writes: "'The Nervous Magic Lantern' is a
rudimentary projector, less an object than an arrangement of lamp and optics
bounding a small open space for the placement and manipulation of things, a
miniature stage area; a spinning shutter alternates light and dark,
providing the 'nervous' factor... 'A Place Where There Is No Trouble' turns
forms in space and tours imaginary landscapes. Impossible changes abound,
the four dimensions turn outlaw. Perhaps more significant than what is seen
are the shifts in perspective from where it is seen." But later in the
program notes he writes, in explaining the "trouble" part of his
performance: "While I understand that New York can't be protected (and that
its leveling would be a real-estate bonanza, should something called America
survive, with the New New York an up-from-the-ashes triumph with music by
Aaron Copland), is it too much to expect from this government some
minimizing of the pain of chemical and biological and explosive destruction?
I heard of cops, buried alive in the WTC rubble, who- enviably-were able to
turn their guns on themselves. Shouldn't we, for instance, be sending our
kids off to school with something to cut pain and terror short?" Later,
after the riveting 90 minutes of sliding, shifting, blurring, muted,
unrecognizable images ended (huge neutrally tinted abstract expressionist
forms slowly migrating across the giant screen to various selections of
Chopin and Cage type music, sometimes symphonic, sometimes sheer sound)
Jacobs answered some questions, after a long ovation from the audience. When
one questioner compared the experience to lying on a hill watching the
clouds, Jacobs quipped: "That would be better. This is something you do on a
rainy day."

In the end, it's being that matters, as it always has; words, images and
poetry very much encompassing much of life's elemental aspects, as long as
there are still rainy days. As Jacobs, at turns, joyfully and grimly
reminded us: we now all live on a precipice as they did long ago in Pompey,
every now and then looking over our shoulders anxiously when we hear the
volcano rumbling.

Does anybody know if there's been a good reception study of Rukeyser
yet?  The ups & downs of her reputation have certainly been more dramatic
than the ups & downs of her work -- She has the distinction of having been

I'm happy to see some recent postings about the Russian Absurdists, some of
whom wrote children's books. I came across a delightful translation of
_First, Second_ by Daniil Kharms, with amazing illustrations by Marc
Rosenthal (in the style of the Katzenjammer Kids, or maybe Rube Goldberg).
I tested the book on my 6 & 9-year old step-grandchildren, who were crazy
about it!

so (jim clinefelter, this one's for you esp.) now we're to be treated
to an anti-digital arts rant, along with the s-o-p anti-academic
rant?... maybe i should also lump in the seemingly innocent swipe
made at "indentations" by m (mpalmer@JPS.NET) who "prefers the
bohemian life to a desk job"---this assertion coming right after, as
it does, the rhetorical admission that  "reams" might have been writ
by academicians about same, without his (?) "knowing"...

and indeed, reams *have* been writ about same, m, as you full well
know---by academicians AND by poets...

i mean, i'm trained to be a good reader, so please forgive my reading
what innuendo i see hereabouts... mr/ms. m, are you trying simply to
be provocative? (as in your last provocateur series on digital
arts)... b/c i for one am becoming less and less willing to respond
to provocateurs---unless of course they're really, really pushing my
buttons, or they really, really have something interesting to offer...

this is all too much, really... yeah, for the record, i like digital
arts (and, uh, indentations), and yeah, they have problems too... i
haven't always endeared mself to my digitally inclined friends by
pointing up said problems (oh yeah, i compose digital stuff mself,
ok?)...

but let's get back to my initial statement:  it was our very own
charles bernstein, i believe, who long ago pointed up the positive
correlation between ranting against digital media and ranting against
less conventional poetries... but i see now a correlation also, at
least in terms of widespread (topical?) grumbling, with the
anti-academic rant (occasionally the anti-intellectual), though of
course one can't accuse digital artists of being academic either (not
with e.g. miekal and so fully qualified to speak to the digital as a
non-academic)...

just what on earth is going on here?... are we all that... angry?...
with another war looming, this is all beginning to feel suspiciously
close to something like displacement (about which nick p and tom and
others can speak far more eloquently than yours truly)... passionate
opinions are one thing, and i for one wouldn't mind arguing the
merits e.g. of digital work with birkerts and his tribes, as i
wouldn't mind exploring the once & future value of indentations...
but out-of-hand generalizations/innuendo about "soulesscrap" don't
really serve to advance the discussion any, nosirreejimetal...

i understand too that this post might only stoke the fires, so let me
try a shaggy dog ending:  i'm not averse to conflict, but i would
like to see some substance here, as it's not enough to pitch
questions/assertions to a thousand people that are designed simply to
raise a few hundred eyebrows...

best,

joe

For those who are interested in things digital, and who in full or
semi-possession of their digits is not, this past weekend LA hosted RACE IN
DIGITAL SPACE 2.0, which, like last year's event at MIT, included both
academics and (gulp) non-academics among the presenters, artists and
performers.  While there weren't many poets on hand this year (Kalamu ya Salaam
spoke last year), there was much that would be of interest to poets --
Eventually, audio files from the conference will appear at:

http://www.annenberg.edu/race/index.html

In the meantime, you can hear audio files from last year's gathering at:

http://cms.mit.edu/race/webcast.html

I hear that the DJ SPOOKY event over at USC was a great party  -- I also hear
that the papers were of real interest --

Joe,

I did not intend to insult anyone; I am sorry the word "scab" insulted
anyone, and I can understand why it might. A lot of poets I admire work as
adjuncts; so did at one point my wife.

Still, it is a sharp way of saying something relevant. In a strike or lock
out the management is fighting no to give some economic advantages to labor
(either pay raises or working conditions or benefits or hire and fire
practices). The management historically fought these demands (after the use
of the police became less rampant) by hiring people who are desperate enough
to accepts the management's conditions. That's why insisting on all the
workers in a given industry being union is important though that might ossify
into its own difficulties.

In the present university system, it seems to me, there are two levels of
teacher/workers. Those who are tenured and the adjuncts, who can be
discontinued any time, who get paid less, with less benefits, etc., and, very
crucial, with very little chance of any advancement. You know the sorry story
better than me. The universities have essentially achieved what others
industries have always fought for.

My real frustration is with those with more substantial positions (a chair,
etc.) If those people took chances, insisted on a more equitable arrangement,
something may happen. Universities need those big names (if nothing but image
purposes). If they refuse to work under those circumstances, the university
must respond.

I wrote a post to the List along these lines a few years ago. It seems to me
the academic community as a whole show little class consciousness (the
economic consequences of their behavior) even though many hold left leaning
opinions.

check, many thanx murat for your clarification... i think my tone
here has been drifting into the red zone of late, so my apologies to
all who might have winced at it...

in point of fact, and though this might be changing, the feds have
(since the yeshiva decision, i think it was '81) generally stood
against collective bargaining of tenured-tenure track faculty at
*private* u's, on the basis that said faculty could in essence be
construed as management personnel at such institutions (if i recall
aright---someone help me out here)... ergo one wrinkle... as to
collective bargaining at state u's, the closest, most recent major
decision against organizing, by faculty vote, was at minnesota
(maria, what happened?)...

then there's the little matter of adjuncts (like grad students)
organizing at places like nyu, a school that has, i'm told, gone out
of its way to undermine the newly minted uaw union... in point of
fact adjunct labor can't be "locked out"---if there were a union in
place this might make sense... and if there were an attempt to
install collective bargaining by adjuncts, and some adjuncts crossed
the picket lines, then the word "scab" might be appropriate (albeit
we might want to examine that word a bit more closely, again)...

but what stops adjuncts from organizing on most campuses is the
precarious nature of their positions, first, which naturally
militates against even the concept of a collective... along with, of
course, nyu-style efforts to sabotage such efforts... adjuncts are
usually spread pretty friggin thin, work wise...

long story, i'm just sketching quickly... you adjuncts out there, speak up!...

as to class consciousness in academe, murat, i entirely agree... here
again, it's one of the few workplaces in which you'll find your
coworkers enjoying potentially far more comfy (or less comfy, if you
deign to look) lifestyles than you enjoy... it's not like assembly
line work, where workers work to make x living... in academe, the
partners of academics can often be relatively high income types,
meaning your colleague who's also making $50K can be living in a
million dollar home (i'm not joking) while fulfilling his/her
lifelong aspirations as a prof... this of course works against
collective bargaining, as lifestyle disparities vitiate the salary
issues... and i haven't even begun to discuss disparities (of salary
etc.) within a given u (between the tech fields, say, and the
humanities)...

yeah, we could use a whole lot more class consciousness in academe,
one of my chief complaints about working as a prof...

best,

joe

Dear Kevin,  could you go back for dessert and ask him his opinion of
May Swenson?  God, I've just realized I don't care about his opinion of

I went to lunch with Donald Allen yesterday and asked him why, for
example, Muriel Rukeyser wasn't one of the poets he included in "The
New American Poetry."  Was it because, as some have speculated, he
considered her part of the "1.5" generation which included Patchen,
Zukofsky, Rexroth.  "No," he replied.  "I just never thought much of
her work.  She was everything the book was supposed to be against.  I
had met her in Berkeley, but got to know her after I met Octavio Paz,
first in Mexico City, then in New York.  He wanted me to publish
Rukeyser's translations of his poems.  I thought they were awful."
Her own poetry?  "Does she have her partisans?"  "I'm one," I flared
out.  "I mean, she's good and she's bad.  We all have our ups and
downs."  He considered.  We were at Benihana and the chef was
throwing things up in the air and stabbing them with knives then
pinning them down on a big hot steel table and the steam was hissing
like mad.  "Bit of a sentimentalist."  Afterwards I thought, but yet
look at our dear John Wieners and he was a bit of a sentimentalist
and what was wrong with that?  But, it was all so long ago and far
away.  It's hard to transport oneself back to another time.

In the late fifties through the early seventies, Laura Ulewicz - a
Polish-American woman from Detroit - was very present in both North Beach
and the Haight-Ashbury. (In the late sixties she own the I & Thou Coffee
Shop on Haight Street, a singular venue for poetry readings during a time
which the  interest in poetry had been replaced by the music, drugs, etc.) =
I
am not sure would have ever fit - or even wanted to fit - the aesthetic
dimensions of the Allen anthology. There were people at the time such as
both Laura and Jack Gilbert (a member of Spicer's workshop) who were
definitely involved, friendly, aware, influenced, and combative within the
local scene, but by temperament they sustained a fierce independence from
the Duncan, Spicer or other umbrellas that fed into the construction of the
Pacific portion of the Allen anthology. But without going further down that
track of associations, I would say that Laura wrote some very significant
poems, indeed quite fierce, probing and smart - drawing from her Polish
American roots, her wanderings back and forth across the country, her
encounters in California. Romantic in its sense of quest, but definitely
very smart and counter-romantic in terms of its continental yield.
Ironically her only literary success was in 1964 when she won the Guinness
Poetry Prize at the Cheltenham Festival of Literature which led to a small
publication, The Inheritance, by Turret books in 1967.  To get a limited
sense of the work, here's a section of a two part series, Within One
Temperate Zone (2)

It wasn't on the map. heat stalled the car
At the valley or base of the 10th hill. Lost.
A post office side the town of San Sinduda. Not
On the map. I asked Carl, "Who do you suppose
has ever climbed that hill?" In a thousand
Years maybe one Indian. A ranch-hand
After cattle. A bull after a cow.
Two boys in black jeans leaned against a log fence
Playing a pocket radio and cursing
Loud to beat the vastness down. A matter
Of will and hot jazz. I said, "It's pretty
Tame here" -  being, of course, wrong. I might
Have meant "too wild with people". And so we climbed,
Until the car should cool, more to escape
Noise than to discover. That seconded
The wrong. Yet, pausing for breath on the ascent,
Carl told me how on his mother's grave in Concord,
While drunk, he first made love to another man.
In Concord - where the hills are monumented
With Hawthorne, Melville, Walden Pond, and our first
Revolution for severance - the fought one.
Now we looked eastward across a namelessness
Of hills. For beyond this one was another equal
In size, and beyond it another, until
Our minds, wanting to fix, were trapped in freedom.
Often I dream I open a hundred doors
And behind each door there is only another door.

*

Laura - to my knowledge - has disappeared from the literary landscape. Last
I saw her was ten years ago at her home in Locke on the Sacramento River in
Northern, California. Anthology omission or not, I think her work definitel=
y
worth a revisit.

Joe,

That's exactly the point, beside many adjuncts working on more than one
campus simultaneously. My idea was the tenured and adjuncts work on the same
side. On the other hand, perhaps the legal analysis was right(!). The tenured
economically (therefore defending their interests) do belong more to the
management side, even in their "ideas" the opposite.

Since I don't teach I may not know the fine points. One question, isn't not
renewing one's yearly contract a kind of lock out?

further sorry for the amplitude in relation to the tiniest particles,
suggesting that the war zone of embryonic talent is lessened in years of
wasting bandwidth, like all those others untethered when there's really so
much time. sorry again for trammels and take away the fact that. if there is
a nice place on earth, away from the pattern of how they look at it, when
invading, then we should seize that point as a departure, rocking to and fro
with the softest words of forgiveness. sorry to even suggest that the waste
makes me human when easy involuntary waxes often, and I have just sat on my
last sonnet. sorry for the sonnets that never could. sorry I counted so
high, while the sonnets wanted their own sorry. sorry that mum said that
there was no more, when time surely knew better. sorry that aliens are in
Allston, Massachusetts, and sorry for their expectation. look, I am sorry
while the Nile goes pouty and the Tibetan woods are no longer in the claim.
sorry about how there is a spell worth sending to the end of class, where
the sentence looks so good. sorry if this all intrudes. my sonnets are sock
monsters, and there's just no time for reverse.

Jim -- to clarify ...

I said 'to the new media poet'.  Not to the poet.  Big difference there.

I'm not talking about Microsoft's code.  Or Macromedia's code.  I personally
prefer code that I don't have to buy specific software/wear (tho I always do
like a nice new outfit) to produce, which I can customize within my own
limited ability to do so.

What I do see though in the work by many of the new media (or digital or
electronic or hypermedia -- take your adjectival pick) poets I admire is a
choice to utilize snippets of code or coded effects/techniques as tropes, as
assonance, as metaphor, etc. and I think these instantiations of code become
poetic devices for those poets.

And I find that very intriguing -- because it opens up certain new
possibilities for discussion concerning developing an aesthetics for new
media poetry (again, substitute your own favorite adjective).

I'm specifically not seeking to bury any other area of poetic practice.
Anyone who has watched my editorial policy knows that ... I enjoy finding
commonalities between schools of thought and expression and probably always
will.

I appreciate your thoughts and those of others who have responded.

best

Jennifer

My sonnets are a sequence written across 14 line fields.  The first 100 were

Reception to follow.  Please join us in celebrating Mr. Everett's

About the Author:
PERCIVAL EVERETT is Professor of English at University of Southern
California. A judge for the National Book Awards in 1998, he is the author
of 13 previous books, including Glyph (1999), Frenzy (1997), Watershed
(1996), and Suder (1983).  He is the 2002 Winner of the Hurston/Wright
Legacy=81 Award for his latest book, Erasure.

Praise for Everett's latest book, Erasure:

"Oases in what too often feels a dreary desert of literary mediocrity,
Everett's books -- and there are many of them, almost one a year for the
last 18 years -- are unfailingly intelligent and funny, formally bold and
intellectually ambitious . . . [the novel-within-the-novel] is a truly vile
and very, very funny piece of writing, mocking the cliches of ghetto
genre-writing with all possible viciousness." -- LA Weekly

"The sharp satire on American publishers and American readers that Everett
puts forward is delicious, though it won't win him many friends among the
sentimental educated class who want to read something serious about black
inner-city life without disturbing any of their stereotypes." -- Chicago
Tribune

"Short, tight and nasty, [the novel-within-the-novel is] as fast and funny
as a modern-day 'Candide'." -- San Francisco Chronicle

"A palimpsest of fictions under fictions under fictions . . . an ingenious
and affecting novel . . . Erasure deserves the attention of anyone -- black
or white -- interested in sophisticated fiction that subtly questions the
phrase 'black and white'. " -- BOOK Magazine

If we think of Bill Berkson as bi-coastal, it's only because we were so
smitten by his recently re-published collaborative work with Frank O'Hara,
Hymns of St. Bridget & Other Writings (The Owl Press). But, yes, to be fair
to him‹and the west coast‹he has, for many years now, been one of the Bay
Area's brightest shining stars, with an oeuvre that includes everything from
art writing to the poems and prose of Serenade (Zoland Books). Don't miss
his rare east-coast visit!

(This is the tragedy of not being "fluent" on a keyboard....Mallarke was off
course Mallarme!) now, main subject:

As to meetings, its not generally known that apart from some of the quite
well known Langpos, I am interestingly, and unbeknown to the larger Poetic
Fraternity, "connected" to John Ashbery (although discretion and breeeding
forbid disclosure of the "how" of this conjunction)..In fact, such is it,
that I buzzed Ashers...oh, so sorry...of course you all call him John or J A
Or John Ashbery, or.... Please DONT make jokes about Siamese twins they're
most tasteless...now, where was I?... only the other day.....oh: but talking
to John as I have over the years, I have ear bashed him re his general
"uningagement" with politics, and the near total hermetic poetics, his
seemingly unstoppable creative outpurrings,..I m-mean outpourings: his
fluidity, his wit, his mix of the popular and the "high" or the "haute", and
the damnable and near clingingly claustrophobic  self referential quality of
his work: but what "saves" John, is, in fact, not his poetry, per se, but,
his shared interest, in, rediscovering, the unlikely, but, suddenly
fascinating writers such as Witter Bynner (naturelement the cognoscenti will
connect my reference to Ern Malley, ha huh) (a writer I myself had stumbled
on) (Bynner I mean) (I've lost his book dammit...) (or did I sell it or lend
it?)...but I was also surprised to discover that it was he, Ashers be
dammed!, who in fact suggested the whole concept of the 4' 33 and one half
of a half of a second performance to John Cage of an evening the both of
them pissed as newts and quite crazy (both being normally quite serious,
e'en sedate personas) after a 20 hour reading and transcription  of the
entire works of Emily Dickinson was mooted to be interlaced or palimpsested
face en face so to speak with those of Emily Dickinson, Schwitters, barrett
watten, Charles Dickens, Browning, Mrs Smith, Ella Wheela Wilcox,
McGonagall, and various others such as John Betjemann (Ashers actually rang
me that very evening  in his cups as was his wont in those days) here;
here!! hehe, ha...be-thinking I was John Tranter but he said that was ok as
he was pissed out of his skull any case, and I reccccommmmended to his
unerring ear  John Betjemann, and reminded him of Ern Malley, and suggested
they could incorporate a REALLY boring Aussie poet such as..well, there's so
many to choose from...he he!!!. ..he) but really John is a wonderful
wonderful man living a joyous and rich life in upstate
NY and visiting the KGB bar betwixt times and so on. He kept asking me
though: is ....he had a long list ....is Andy Warhol REALLY dead, and his
tape recorder (did it get smashed or is it still hidden safely somewhere in
a grave?), and why did Beuys talk to that hare ( "dead" hare he repeatedly
quizzes?) (he cant "get" that one - strange, John having such a subtle mind)
is Jim Dine dead, Jaspers, Johns,  de Kooning, Mel Bochner, Duane, Freud
(the artist), and so on... and he was most anxious that  I had read every
single book - nay every letter of every word! - ever written about him and
by him and all his poetry books ( for which _raison _he wont hear a word
against Harold Bloom! ..) ( he has a habit of cunningly asking what is on
page 75 line 28 of eg "A Vermont Note Book") and all his writings,and I kept
reassuring, him that, (he gets in such a state), that, yes, John, how could
I not? Poor dear Johnannes... I couldnt get him interested in politics
though, and ...in fact that's a point: there is a strange side effect in
talking to John - who is a kind of US Picasso of poetry: one becomes snake -
mesmerised by his near-sad, yet crisp, East Coast accents, and e'en here, in
the antipodes,  so far from my distant rele, so far yet - in oh such a
mortal way so near!!!....there is a soothing and ancient sadness (despite
the seeming acerbity with which that said mellowness seems  to be
intermodulate): as of thrice sung songs, and  mellow fruitfulness amid apple
trees, and fruit around the vine, and things being plumped, and the last
oozings...ah think not on them!! ah!!

Lovely man, so wise, so erudite, so so so, so Ashberic a man: I always leave
the phone with enormous reluctance after "goodnightynighting" dear Ashey,
and my whole being is aglow and bright and afire with the joy and the
existential "squeal" of _Lifefulness_ (das Lebenlicht,  if I recall
correctly, it is, in German)....at having been "in touch" with such an
immortal mortal.

Jennifer,

I'm curious as to what you mean when you say that code can
be used "as assonance." Do you mean "for"? And can you give
an example?

Thanks
Damian

Thanks! I sincerely appreciate that explication, JB. I knew there was a
14-line connection lurking in there someplace, but couldn't quite figure it
out. And so prolific - wow! What is it about the writing of sonnets that is
so addictive?

You should be careful with the name-calling.  You should know that every state has different labor laws; here in Ohio adjunct professors are prohibited by law from organizing.

Joe,

I did not intend to insult anyone; I am sorry the word "scab" insulted
anyone, and I can understand why it might. A lot of poets I admire work as
adjuncts; so did at one point my wife.

Still, it is a sharp way of saying something relevant. In a strike or lock
out the management is fighting no to give some economic advantages to labor
(either pay raises or working conditions or benefits or hire and fire
practices). The management historically fought these demands (after the use
of the police became less rampant) by hiring people who are desperate enough
to accepts the management's conditions. That's why insisting on all the
workers in a given industry being union is important though that might ossify
into its own difficulties.

In the present university system, it seems to me, there are two levels of
teacher/workers. Those who are tenured and the adjuncts, who can be
discontinued any time, who get paid less, with less benefits, etc., and, very
crucial, with very little chance of any advancement. You know the sorry story
better than me. The universities have essentially achieved what others
industries have always fought for.

My real frustration is with those with more substantial positions (a chair,
etc.) If those people took chances, insisted on a more equitable arrangement,
something may happen. Universities need those big names (if nothing but image
purposes). If they refuse to work under those circumstances, the university
must respond.

I wrote a post to the List along these lines a few years ago. It seems to me
the academic community as a whole show little class consciousness (the
economic consequences of their behavior) even though many hold left leaning
opinions.

Murat

making no difference whatsoever, these missives of absolution, as if
recuperated, a moment or more, of ordinary life, the battered powers of
performative language, creation from the start - the havoc comes from
elsewhere, the block-packages of texts-of-truth, the true-real texts from
which there is no escape, apocalyptic shifting - it's in our nature to
hope that prayer - supplication - that a difference is made with utterance
- in fact it makes no difference whatsoever - things remain brutally tied
to substance - we predict and play - i write as if there's no tomorrow -
as if this is the last missive, the last missile - as if this is the last

<There's no doubt that Plath was a sick puppy. But serious people can
read her work without signing up for any victim-cult. That was my
point. Not that I endorse her goofy world-view, any more than
Marjorie Perloff does when she calls Plath "an extraordinary poet" or
speaks of her "peculiar ability to fuse the domestic and the
hallucinatory.">

I Add 2 cents, in agreement:

The problem with poets who have both talent and a cult of
personality is that the two become hard to unweave . . . so the talent
tends to get swamped in the personality. At least that's true with
Plath, as she remains THE one poet that many people know, or know
of. Works well for her name recognition, but doesn't help her poems
one bit. And several are worth knowing. Even a HUGE, overtaught
one like "Daddy."

On the other hand, I think Sexton is just plain awful. Blather, in fact.

Thanks, George, good to know, esp. about the short lines. My own allergy
to the whole morbid circus that followed Plath's death has kept me away
from her for decades. It's only reading others on her work, actually,
that took me back. And then I remembered that I had learned a lot from
her--and I don't mean from her content but from the suppleness of her
lines, her music.

Of course, as Maria mentions, she would never have fit into the Allen
anth. But that doesn't explain, say, Diane di Prima's absence. Or some
others.

As for pity-parties, though, Wieners is right in there (as Kevin says),
getting the shindig started. But his self-pity comes off as faded
grandeur. And somehow we love him for it.

Odd.

Dear --m

The first poet to indent in this currently silly, but once astute manner
which later was dubbed "field" was French. This should not be surprising
as all innovative items,  even terms such as "avante guarde" itself,
were invented by the French. In the recent hoax letter purportedly sent
from the UN by Alicia notice how it seems more real because the first
twenty three people are from France, further proof of all things
originating from France. Many poets have realized and mined this truth,
M. Palmer, for example, exploits this fold by naming an experimental
work Baudelaire series. Mallarme was the poet progenitor of the field,
Un coupe de des jamais n'abolira le hasard, the poem. The poem is not A
THROW OF THE DICE NEVER WILL ABOLISH CHANCE as Richard would have you
believe, as this is merely a substitute, even if performed by a man
named Pierre, a translation into an inferior language. As a French
Indian I have been accused of being avant guard but only 50% of the time
as the rest of me is narrative. I am so tired of bears and feathers.
Field is a journal in Ohio which was experimental, but similar to the
situation with Bob Hass' Field Notes, once removed from the sideline
construct, it was found to be only a human wish of something more than
ordinary. A relative of mine, Jacques, is a famous film star, another a
well known vampire. Since vampires are a derivative of the dandy and
pierrot this explains their coolness, that French Connection.

Be well

I know we sometimes get a breakdown of the list membership by nationality - I
was wondering if an equivalent execercise could be done via email domain? .edu,
.com etc? Not that it would shine a light on any particular corner, just mildly
curious.

Hey thank you!  This reminds me of Ander Monson's great poem "Index" in
the current issue of Conduit.  Sometimes subject matter just has to be
corseted, or asbestos-gloved.  I particularly like the prices here.

murat, i think the analogy is way off though---in what sense does a
professorial position constitute (with or w/o tenure) a managerial
position?... the blurring comes in with administrators (chairs, some
deans) who teach, yes, and who manage staff... but in point of fact i
don't "manage" a workforce (my students?  no way!... staff? not
unless i'm in an admin slot of sorts, again, such as grad
director)... so where is the comparison to (say) the management ranks
one finds in fortune 1000?... and then of course we *have* an actual
educational administration on every campus, which asssociated duties
are quite a bit different than the sorts of bureaucratic duties most
faculty are immersed in (which turn largely on faculty governance
issues at the outside, and dept. and curricular issues on the
inside)...

as to lock-out, again, i can't see it... first off, many adjuncts
(such as kass here) have a course-by-course contract (it's not even
yearly, would that it were!)... secondly, not renewing someone's
contract turns on any number of factors, and is about as capricious
as it gets---one evil of the system is that it's set up to work this
way, w/zero commitment to such workers... someone goes on leave, we
need another adjunct faculty member, e.g... this latter scenario,
which sounds innocent enough on the surface, becomes a model of
exploitation for campuses that wish to control their labor force with
a heavy hand (grad student labor can be much the same, but here
again, adjuncts are treated a notch below even ta's)... visiting
positions are another thing---that term, "visiting," always makes me
chuckle btw (having been a visiting, on a wing and a prayer)---but
the way adjunct labor can be moved around at whim is a sight to
behold...

if they're being "locked out," in any case, then i'd say adjuncts had
best unionize, if only to fulfill the analogy!... i'd say much the
same for profs, who could stand to profit from collective
bargaining---but again, academics need first to think of themselves
as *workers*...

i understand how adjunct labor can be a "nice" thing for folks who
wish to do part-time teaching, yes... but in point of fact there are
a number of such workers out there who are hoping against hope that
this will be their way into a full-time job---and they're being
encouraged to believe so at every rung of the academic ladder, to phd
and beyond... no question it's a knotty issue, but i think we really
must bring to it some clearcut thinking about what's ethically right,
and wrong, in said workplace...

best,

joe

  "If" "I" "were" "running" "a conference"

1/ TTTTTTThere would be no superstars.

2/ AAAAAAAny gathering of differing viewpoints, no matter the context,
would be self-facilitating, with particular attention paid to close
listening, to representing the accumulation of experience & wisdom.
speaking louder, faster, or more aggressively would not be the
bottomline for being heard.

3/ IIIIIIIdeas would be dynamic & useful conceptual trampolines from

desires.  Ideas would not be precious cultural artifacts frozen in time
& place, traded like so many hog futures on the chicago stock exchange.

4/ IIIIIIn my community, gatherings are organized with notions of
networking & information exchange front & center, organized around an
urgent sense of breeding each our independent concerns in a collective
assemblage.  The academic conferences I've been to also have this
thirst for such activity, but it always seems to be over beers & coffee
before & after the event itself. Id be willing to bet that this is
truly what a lot of the veteran conference junkies consistently find to
be the most useful & memorable.

5/ TTTTTTThe life of thot would not be extracted & examined only in a
way which removes the consequences of our assumptions & beliefs from
what it actually takes to survive on day-to-day basis.  There is much
to be learned from cooking & eating with people, from involving our own
children in these practices which we consider to be so dear, from
dematerializing the borders between work & play.  Examples are numerous
& the point is that the operating codes of the conference as we know it
(or at least how I've experienced it in the dozen or so conferences
I've been to in my lifetime) seem to be a very static & deeply
troubling roadblock for genuine discourse in a world that includes more
than the university itself.  Being at such an event is a constant
reminder why I see so many young people looking elsewhere for a more
gestural & cocreative praxis.

Some of the management/labor legal confusion comes from the way most
academic departments are structured -- that is, not only are most chairs,
deans & provosts themselves nominal members of the faculty, but
departmental decisions about hiring, non-renewal, scheduling etc. often
involve a faculty committee -- courts like to point to the rather thin
veneer of "faculty governance" as a reason to deny labor organizing rights
to professors, but it would usually take no more than one meeting with a
dean to realize how little management power, as opposed to responsibility,
is actually lodged with the faculty.

I was bothered by the ref. to "scab" labor myself -- That term is generally
used to refer to replacement labor brought in at a time of strike, lockout,
contract non-renewal etc -- what the adjunct faculty pool is really a part
of is the rapidly increasing move to "casual" labor forces in the name of
"flexibility" -- which makes them more like the ever-vulnerable "support"
staff and cleaning crews -- There is no justifiable basis in fluctuating
enrollments or curricular flexibility for the massive move to "part-time"
staffing of academic departmes --

I hope that was a joke about May Swenson.

As a grizzled veteran who got the Allen anthology when it came out, I
am befuddled by the notes here about who might have been included. I
mean that Plath, Swenson, etc. were not excluded because they were
women; they were excluded for the same reason that X.J. Kennedy and
Robert Lowell were excluded.

Ron,
     thanks for putting up the 'myths of langpo' piece.  it might go some
ways toward defusing the industry of unclear reputation-building attacks?
This is NOT, I repeat NOT a defense of langpo or an attack on attackers.

     I'm still unclear about the meaning of 'asyntactical' as used by Leary
It would seem in a gnostic context it might mean that langpoers were
agnostic in their attitude toward syntax or athiests who didn't believe that
syntax was 'god'?  or just fuzzy langpo?

     'bubbler' was an accepted term as early as 1950 in Milwaukee.  i always
assumed it came from the German creative influence there as in the thingie
that gBubblens?

I was referring to a previous post (I don't remember whose) where it was
mentioned a court in one of the states said that faculty members can not
strike because they are part of the management.


>as to lock-out, again, i can't see it... first off, many adjuncts

That's my point. The adjuncts are powerless. The college can do whatever it
wants in regards to them and call it whatever it wants, including pressuring
state legislatures to pass laws which make strikes by teachers illegal.

Here is the gist of my argument. The only group of people among teachers who
have a modicum of power are a few high visibility stars. A college needs them
for prestige to attract good students, grants, etc. They have an added value
to the colleges besides their teaching. If this group identified itself with
the majority of other teachers (adjuncts, etc.) and refused to work under the
mistreatment of the rest of teachers, then some change, improvement might be
possible. But I don't think most of the "stars" feel this identification with
the rest, to the degree at least of losing their positions. They act in terms
of individual interests. As a result, adjuncts are powerless and in my
opinion completely exploited.

I'm still finding this thread to be fascinating.  I wonder about some of
this, though, and the ramifications some of this has for "the end of
tenure" -- these "stars" are increasingly nomadic, too, no?

>> A college needs them for prestige to attract good students, grants,
etc.

Do undergrads have a level of awareness which allows them to choose
their institutions based on who is teaching there?  I would argue no.
So, this consideration applies to large research institutions which
grant PhDs and to smaller institutions which grant MFAs.  It also
applies to the pool of graduate student applicants.  Who already want to
become teachers, no?

Someone once told me, "behind every successful academic career is a
brilliant grant writer".  In other words, is the academic job in a
research institution actually a fundraising job?  It is common outside
of academia to have to save or make a certain multiple of one's salary.


The "stars" -- are they valued because they can speak at fundraisers?

I know many local poets who give all their students As, don't require
any writing or reading, tell all the students they're great, tell them
they'll be able to get great teaching jobs, so that their classes fill
(or so that they can charge $100 / wk a head at their private
workshops).

Did they think they teach anything?  Do they value their work?  What is
it?  Do they value it because they are paid?

>> They have an added value to the colleges besides their teaching.

So perhaps only the value the adjuncts have represents the value of
teaching (common argument).

How valued is the content in these courses adjuncts teach?  And who
values it?  Or is not teaching it valued more?

The US is becoming 1) less regional, 2) more concentrated in urban
areas.  I was under the impression that it was easier to get a better
teaching job in a less desirable location, and that there were more
adjuncts in NYC and LA, due to capitalism or something.

Yet another -- did I learn anything about poetry in school?  No.  So, I
was unreasonable to think that there were jobs teaching it.

They kept finding this thread to be fascinating. They kept lashing the
adjunct to the post. They kept looking away from what they might do to be
with words.
They kept fundraising. Or skirt raising. Whatever worked and would feed them
for a day. They kept listening to nomadic colleagues. They kept wishing the
institutions would keep their colleagues for more than a year. Or three.
They kept wishing their lashed to the post now colleagues would have a real
contract. More than 10 months. They kept wishing their posted lashing
comrades would be hired for more than 30 hours a  week so their comrades
would get health insurance.
They kept wishing institutions would hire them for real instead of only
wanting adjuncting. They kept wishing they could pick a word like adjunct
off like a scab.
Off a post. They kept wishing this. All the time now.
They kept wishing the undergrads would be born aware.
They kept wishing they were all made of stars.
They kept wishing 'adjunct' did not mean 'a subordinate or incidental
thing.'
Unlike a scab which itches of course before it heals.

In regard,
Jane

If you were running a conference and this was what its like
I would be there
and I would bring Ithaca in a handbasket
and my adjunct friends who do what we do
because our options are so few
and we matter to our students
and our students hold symposia on "class"
and "academe"
and I would bring my students too
and some are wee (4yrs old) and some
are huge
and do you have examples of where to go to see exquisite examples of
code/poetics/poesis as the ones I know often leave me longing...
I think you should do a conference like this
sooooooooon.

Omigod--that is, like, so cosmic!  I too am going to be reading in this
series, and I TOO WAS ONCE FORCED TO DE-VEIN HIDEOUS SOGGY DEAD SHRIMP AT A
(VERY) SHORT-LIVED GIG AT A SEAFOOD RESTAURANT (Seafood Palace, Modesto,
California, three days in the early 80's).

You probably are right most of them don't. But don't the "rankings" of
colleges and universities use the "quality" of the faculty (not necessarily
the quality of teaching) as one of the relevant factors in this rankings;
don't educational institutions try to get higher rankings?

A few questions: who gets tenure and who works as an adjunct in MFA programs?
Is there a distinction between between an adjunct in a MFA program and one
teaching freshman composition?

My impression is that the university gets a cut (more politely a percentage
for administrative expenses) of one's grant; of course, this is particularly
relevant in "scientific" fields (physics, chemistry, biology, very advanced
mathematics, etc).

Aren't the colleges themselves in on this con since often in their
calculations the quality of teaching is irrelevant?

I understand that in many colleges an course taught by an adjunct must have a
minimum number of students not to be cancelled. This is a direct equation
between the value of an adjuct and the income he/she produces for the
institution: a learning structure based purely on commercial rational,

I wonder what percentage of teachers in a given university or college are
adjuncts?


>How valued is the content in these courses adjuncts teach?  And who
>values it?  Or is not teaching it valued more?

Catherine, you tell me how valued the content/quality of teaching is? I have
no doubt there are many many adjuncts who put their hearts and soul into
teaching. But, in the economic structure, how valued is that effort?

In my view, higher educational institutions in the States have anticipated
practicing by many years (before corporations even) the worst vice of global
capitalism, the ability to pursue and use the cheapest, least protected
labor. I hope I am not insulting anyone in this list, but that's the way the
adjunct position appears to me to be used; that's where my beef is. I would
like to know if I am wrong.

There are more adjuncts everywhere. Amazing, how the language of free market
economics has permeated the idea of a university, so different from medieval
monasteries where excess time was used (by some) to copy down or tramnslate
or read secret knowledge. What happened to excess time?


>Yet another -- did I learn anything about poetry in school?  No.  So, I

Exactly my experience at Amherst, except for an old professor called Baird's
Shakespeare course, where each week for forty-five minutes he meandered
around a Shakespeare play, maybe quoting one single passage. That meandering
taught me everything about poetry.

Murat, it was just in the California papers that 52% of
statewide Cal State faculty are adjuncts. That's 11,000
versus 10,000 tenured or tenure-track, if I remember the
numbers correctly. However the state administration has
supposedly committed to a goal of 75% tenured faculty by
2010.

The English dept. at my local CSU, Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo, has 31 full-time faculty and 24 lecturers,
slightly better than the statewide figure. Union rules
there require that lecturers who've taught before get first
crack at next year's jobs -- some small measure of job
security for them.

One hears the horror stories -- no office space, hellish
commutes from school to school, no benefits -- but it's
also true that a person can get one of these jobs with only
an MA and can teach at the university level without the
necessity of publishing or serving on committees. Without
the privilege, one might also say -- depends on what you
want.

How common is it, I wonder, for an academic couple to
consist of one full-time prof and one adjunct? Seems to be
the way many couples get around the awful problem, given
extreme job scarcity, of how to work in the same
geographical area.

Another of the Beatles
recurring themes involved
songs written by
John Lennon.

It seems
that Lennon had
a fascination
with the number nine
that was only
overpowered
by his love for Yoko.

"One After 909"
"Revolution No. 9"
"#9 Dream"
           Ironically,
this song was a part
of Lennon's ninth
solo album
which was released
in the ninth month
of 1974. The song even
peaked at number 9
in the charts.
AND....
A verse in the song
has nine syllables,
"Ah, bowakawa,
pousse pousse."

His album, Mind Games,
contains nine letters
in its title
Another of Lennon's
album names
contains nine
letters.
The album was his dedication
to classic rock
and was entitled:
Rock 'n' Roll

John Lennon
was born
on October, 9 1940
Some even say
he was born
at 6:30pm. 6 + 3 + 0 = well
you figure it
out.
His son
was also born
on the ninth
When John Lennon was
shot, on
December,
8th 1980,
it was already
December 9th
in his hometown
of Liverpool,
England. Liverpool
has
nine
letters

When an engineer said
"Revolution
number nine"
to begin the recording
of the song
by the same name,
John loved the sound.
He was lucky
that it had been
recorded.
John looped
the recording
over and over
again throughout
the beginning
of "Revolution No. 9"
Nine letters
make up the most
important phrase
of one of John's
most important
antiwar songs.
All we
are saying,
is give peace a chance.

JOhn OnO LennOn
and YOkO OnO LennOn's
combined names
contain nine O's

John's elementary
school bus number
happened to be 72.
7 + 2 = 9 (We know
its a stretch) He even
lived in apartment 72
in New York.
Yet another 9.
McCartney, his best friend
through most of his
life, is spelled
with 9 letters.

If you know of
anything else,
Let us know!

This seems like the moment to discuss the globalism debate and its relation to poetry -- and to do so from the point of view of poetry, if that's possible.

Among popular political writers there are already plenty of cliches circulating on this topic.  But, unless I'm mistaken, poets have not yet had a lot to say.  Or perhaps they are saying it, and their readers aren't paying attention.

For myself, I'm not sure how to begin thinking about his issue.

hello all,

        I always enjoy Ron Silliman's Blog, but I took issue with his =
Oct. 12 posting regarding the Top 10 Myths about Language Poetry and his =
reading of Andrew's Lip Service.  This casual reading (and the =
subsequent commentary) reveals an anxiety about the reception of LangPo =
(and Silliman does not seem uncomfortable with that label, at least =
here) that undermines many of the positive reading methods that LangPo =
is beginning to introduce into the poetic (and academic) mainstream.

       What better way to start this exercise than invoking the Language =
Poetry muse...

"When I say that the orders "Bring me sugar" and "Bring me milk" make =
sense, but not the combination "milk me sugar", that does not mean that =
the utterance of this combination of words has no effect.  And if its =
effect is that the other person stares at me and gapes, I don't on that =
account call it the order to stare and gape, even if that was precisely =
the effect I wanted to produce." --Wittgenstein, Philosophical =
Investigations 498 (trans. Anscombe)

         Now then, I'll come back to that later, but lets take a look at =
Silliman's conclusions about the implications of Andrews' writing being =
considered anti-grammatical and non-narrative by many readers:

    Andrews is using poetry to make an argument here, quite like Dante, =
and the     exposition is hardly impenetrable. Nor is his thesis so =
revolutionary that it             should cause a reader to stumble. None =
of it requires the kind of mind-numbing     detail that I've laid out =
here - a casual reader should be able to sense almost     all of this =
just perusing the text. Any college senior, regardless of major, who     =
can't pick up 80 percent of it just by reading the passage above ought =
to             demand a refund of his or her tuition - because this =
isn't scholarship, it's             literacy. And the inability to do =
this suggests a pretty sad state of affairs.

=20

Several interesting things to be picked up here that run contrary to the =
average LangPo thoughts on reading:  Silliman reads Lip Service as a =
text with a "thesis," an "argument," an "exposition," and as a text that =
is "penetrable."  He goes on to say that the casual reader should be =
able to "sense almost all of this," the this presumably being the =
meaning that Silliman produces in his reading.  In the coup de grace, =
Silliman declares that any college graduate, if plunked down in some =
nightmarish version of the GRE which had a reading comprehension section =
with Lip Service as the primary text, should be able to "pick up" =
(comprehend) at least 80 percent of it. (Can you imagine it? "Question =
42: What effect does the phrase 'Charm Master' have on the author's =
overall argument?" "fuck...")

        In the next paragraph brings in an almost quasi-religious =
metaphor with the reference to the movie Pleasantville--as if those who =
don't "get" a text like Lip Service are lost while those who "get" it =
are found.  Having established that here Silliman is trying to perform a =
sort of positivist reading of Lip Service as an expository, penetrable, =
narrative, grammatical, and apparently transendental text, it becomes =
easy to retroactively subvert his reading.  There's a lot of fodder =
here; I'll just make a couple of main points and then move on to the =
last line. =20

     First off, Silliman's reads about "80 percent" of the passage as a =
sort of layered metacommentary on the poetic process, which is a =
fruitful reading, but one that immediately limits the audience--how =
could a biology major possibly associate "projective" with "persona" or =
"voice-as-breath-as-persona"?  How would they understand the word "goof" =
as pointing towards Allen Ginsberg, and thus "multiple lines of =
simultaneous heritage?"  And further more, if the entire passage is read =
as an analysis of language, doesn't it violate one of Silliman's 10 =
commandments of LangPo, thou shalt not write poetry to prove a theory?  =
If all we wanted was this sort of commentary, there's plenty of =
perfectly expository, penetrable prose Andrews' has written on the =
subject of linguistics.

        Secondly, what if we read the piece looking for the subject =
matter of the professed "raw material"--looking at a phrase like =
"somehow pumps" or "scared to fake" while thinking about "love, erotic =
intimacy, gender socialization& the body" they open up several new =
vectors of possible meaning for the passage.

        I find the two neologisms of the last line just as appealing as =
Silliman does, but I find his reading of them next to incomprehensible.  =
Silliman reads the first neologism as "jokingly characteriz[ing] the =
omnipresence of immanence's lush visuality - it's just there, =
everywhere." =20

Ok--so in this neologism we have one familiar prefix "simul" and one =
familiar noun "crayon."  There is also a very close homophonic =
resemblance to the noun "simulacrum"--"a likeness, an semblance, a mock =
appearance, a sham;--now usually used in the derogatory sense." =
(Webster's)  So--for me, its most interesting for me to read this as a =
characterization of the "simulacrum" as a simulated (fake) child's =
coloring tool.  Which is interesting.  Somehow.  And I've drawn it =
directly out of the syllables on the page.

On to door number 2..."scopafidelity."  Once again, to relatively =
distinct morphemes here (maybe 3?), the obvious fidelity, scope, and the =
questionable a.  My first instinct is to read it directly as "scope" =
(range of vision) [is] "a" "fidelity," in the sense of fidelity as =
"faithfulness; adherence to right [values]" (Webster's, brackets mine).  =
This is an interesting intellectual point that I could see =
contextualized with Andrews' expository writings.  But this reading is =
certainly not demanded by any sort of syntax--why not go with the pun on =
scope, as in the mouthwash, and fidelity as it is used in the world of =
audio technology (high fidelity)--then you get an image of input signals =
that are sort of washed out or steralized.  Silly, but it works, and =
with Andrews' interest in commodification etc., I wouldn't put it past =
him (not that we're bothering with anything like 'intent' here).  How =
you get the "psychotropic or drugged" images out of the last neologism =
are beyond me, but if thats what Silliman sees, all I can do is give him =
a big Shakespearean "and that is true too."

       Ahem, so to return to our insatiable muse, ladies and gentlemen, =
Bruce Andrews is indeed asking us to "milk the sugar," and if we are to =
do anything except stand and gape, we must accept his language as =
working outside (agrammatically) or even against (antigrammatically) our =
socially constructed grammatical system; he certainly does all he can to =
help us come to this realization in his practice and theory.  Sure, its =
not "word salad" in some pejorative sense, the ruptures and breaks, the =
very moments where Lip Service becomes "non-sense" (and why not call it =
that?) are the most interesting moments in the text, and form the basis =
for any sort of linguistic or social critique that the text does make.  =
But these syntactical ruptures are certainly not systematic in the sense =
that they create a "penetrable" meaning.  They are intentionally (and =
brilliantly) asystematic in a way that forces the words and syllables of =
the text to become multivalent and generative.  If Ron Silliman objects =
to the amount of "standing and gaping" in the public reception of =
Language Poetry, then he needs to attack the idea that meaning need be =
(can be?)penetrable, not the idea that LangPo is antigrammatical or =
non-narrative.

       My critique here is not Silliman-specific, tho his reading =
provided a convenient example--I think a similar critique could be made =
in regard to many Language Poets--in general there is a positivist =
assertion running underneath much LangPo commentary, the assertion that =
the meaning of the poetry is more or less inseperable (all accusations =
of "proving a theory" aside) from the theory--Language Poetry as =
accessible to only the few, the proud, the theory geeks (present company =
surely included).  I think Language Poetry as made an indelible =
contribution to American poetry, and I'm willing to make the assertion =
that said contribution would be significant even without the theoretical =
side of it.

       David Shapiro made an interesting comment at the memorial reading =
for Kenneth Koch the other day...he said he gave Koch some Wittgenstein =
to read and Koch read it and said "don't we know all this already?"  =
Koch was an amazing reader, but one thing that struck me as odd about =
his classroom technique and his readings in Make Your Own Days was his =
strict sense of what was "sense" and what was "nonsense."  Despite the =
presentation of this unfashionable dichotomy, Koch performed (in every =
sense of that word) amazing readings from things that he declared as =
"complete nonsense."  Koch had developed a sensibility that recognized =
the possibilities and pleasures of language that was generative and =
multivalent; a sensibility that evolved primarily out of his engagement =
with poetry, not expository theory (arguments about the New Critics' =
influence on Koch aside--he definitely wasn't someone actively engaged =
with theory throughout his life, in any case).

    So in conclusion--let's all read like Kenneth Koch.  In language =
there is that which is recognizable as sensible and syntactical, even if =
syntax is socially constructed, and there is that which is not.    I =
think King Lear is complete nonsense.  I think Tjanting is complete =
nonsense.  I think Lip Service is complete nonsense.  My sense of the =
possibility of language was enriched by reading all of these works.  =
Cheers,

What about a Webartery Conference?  Run along lines we deterine on the list
or on a wiki for the pourpose of planning the conference, and done in a way
so as not to exclude non-academics (or academics, either).  A conference
where we can talk about the nuts and bolts of making web art (code,
technique, structure, types of works) as well as its significance
(implications for traditional literature & art, cruticism of web art and how
to form a critical language for it, does web art democratize orart by being
widelty available or is it and elitist form?, sources of web art in
traditional literature like specific poetic movements and artistic
movemenets and so forth, philosophy of web art).   In keynote secssions, We
could also try to categorize the types of pieces that exist into various
genres and point out the gaps -- show what is lacking in current work.  Have
we achieved true interactivity?  Is true interactivity desirable?  What new
structures/genres are possible, especially ones that can reach people with
current or old computers?  What advances in computer technilolgy willl
affect web art?  How do we preserve web art?  How do we increase our
audience or is this necessary? etc. etc.

There should also be tutorials on various technical topics, for example
Flash, Director, DHTML & Javascript, Java Applet Writing (for those who know
Java!), making sites that interact using server-side coding (ie sites that
remember vistors and are modified by them), generative poetics, advanced
HTML use with Dreamweaver/GoLive (to make rollovers, actions in one frame
affect another frame, client side forms that guide the user experience,
etc.), Photoshop, Illustrator

and some basic tutorials for writers and artists who are not web artists
where they learn in a day to make a simple web work out of poetry and art
they may have done before or that they create on the fly during the
tutorial.

During the turtorials, those who do not want tutorials could be in small
discussions (not panel discussions) on specific topics which have a small
limit on how many peple can join (first come, first serve).  Each group
would have a nominal leader with some expertise to run the discussion, and
there would be a computer connected to the web with a big screen and also a
CD rom drive and people could say "well, in such-sand-such a piece" and the
piece would be put on the computer so that people couuld play with it while
the person made their point about what it illustrated.  They could also make
points with works of their own brought on CD or commercial CDs or whatever
they brought as props.  The discussion would spend its last half hour
emitting some conclusions and summarizing itself in a document which would
become part of the conference proceedings; said document would be in
hypertext and include working links to referenced works.

There would of course be the usual sessions where people are chosesn to
present works to the larger group but efforts would be made to solicit them
from all over and not just from successful web artists known to the
organizers.  Unlike many such conferences though, presenters would explain
the genesis of the work and show its insides (code, Fla or Dir file, etc.)
and explain what skills were needed to produce it.  This wouod be a
presentaion structure for practitioners, who might want to know how a
certain effect was prduced as well as what it means on the viewer's level.
Pieces would also be discussed in a sophisticated manner telling what ideas
are implicit or motivated them and not just (look here: if you press the red
button, it says "hello")

We'd have to get significant funding for the conference. An important thing
would be to have computers all around in the spaces between meeting rooms
where people could congregate by twos and threes, to pay the presenters and
instructiors and discussion leaders enough that we can attract top people in
the field, to keep the conference fee low so that people like me could
attend (or have scholarships for the needy), to have a decent hotel or
conference center (hotel is better because then people are together at night
as well) that served the ubiquitous grilled chicken in a not too awful
disguise :-), to have off-site social events making use of culture of the
conference location and giving people a braik from the hotel and web art--
depending on the area this could include museum trips and galleries, night
life, readings, music, guided tours, whatever -- and have them included in
the conference fee or else very inexpensive (no $20 parties where you learn
afterwards that all the most profound thisngs were said but you didn't go
because it was so expensive), provisions for both drinks and people who do
not drink alcohol (ie some decent non alcoholoc drinks at every event),
accessibility for the disabled (ramps, wide doorways, curb cuts at all
venues; no bathrooms accessible only by stairs, music volume not too loud so
as to make it possible for hearing impaired and mentally ill people to
converse, no important activity requiring physical prowess -- ie people can
go and play basketball inthe hotel to wind down, but a conference wide
weight liftig contest (:-) would be unfair to the disabled and simply out of
shape [everyone knows that ping pong is a tradition and I don't mean to
exclude it.  You can even play it in a wheelchair and it doesn't require
great bodily strength!]

I'm dreaming.  I know I'm dreaming.  But some people on this list are good
fundraisers.  And webartery itself has a certain amount of clout in the
community, so people might attend a "WEBARTERY 2003: The Practice and
Implications of Web Art"  If we got something of a grant and there were a
conference fee for those who could pay (like those employed by universities
who would get sent for free), we might make back most of the money.  I've
been involved in planning a conference before and it's kind of frustrating
(especially dealing with the hotels and comparing them and telling them
exactly what kind of space you need like we need an good place for our
lunchieon for 500 people with a stage and mic and waitress service and
optional kosher food and optional vegetarian food etc etc."  Oh -- and my
cardinal rule from many conferences: DON'T HAVE SPEAKERS DURING LUNCH!!!!
(especially on the forst day) It's annoying and lunch is the only easy way
to meet your fellow conferees at a large conference, because you are trapped
at a small table with some of them.  But it's really cool to see the events
you plan come into being and meet people and talk about their talks
beforehand and then see what they really do.

[I was involved with this in my mental health advocate days, when I worked
for NAMI-RI and was on the conference committee.  We managed to have a
conference that cost only $50 -- one day -- and $100 on the day of the
conference but was nearly free to mentally ill folks and people in poverty,
that made significant money for the organization and was a lot of fun and
very informative, with medical information that was new reasearch no one
knew about discussed by the researchers and advocates from all over the
country who came and gave talks on illness management and programs and so
forth.  And this was Rhode Island!  By contrast, New York City has a $150
cocktail party which is totally boring and snooty and has expensive hors
d'oeuvres and no real food (we served a full lunch plus snacks twice and
breakfast at our RI conference) and they invite a lot of celebrities and few
ill people, they spend half the year planning it, and they don't make much
money.  Conferences rule!]

Thank you, Philip: One of the most informative sites I've ever seen. And
with the lagniappe of finding one at least one of our listees as
contributor/agent.

Fulcrum should consider an issue on this and related forms alone.

  hi, did I tell you my name is honey with an h?


        this was somewhere else as a persona hung around me like scent;  =
an=20
image of an image that had neither details or persuasion. perhaps I was=20=

drawn to this whiff of stale air because the face was familiar or the=20
vocal cords seemed enveloped in a touchstone of security from my=20
childhood, but at this point there was nothing more than a vague=20
shadow-show in front of me that may or may not have been. my options=20
where to carry on the conversation with an image that might amount to=20
nothing more than talking to myself, or find some other route that=20
produced different special effects.  in either case this conversation=20
or another might continue, but with less distinctions.  it could be=20
this was nothing more then a walk on into my own personal story by some=20=

two-bit player who the director  owed a personal favor to?
        as the monologue continued, I noticed each of my forward motions =
steps=20
had its own particular momentum,  time lapsed as each step made contact=20=

with a momentary edifice sending a slight vibration thru the cartilage,=20=

thru the soul in doubt and out into the universe.  at the same time I=20
was aware how my mouth moved, ears tingled, and how my brain=20
recalculated substance.  I was also aware at that precise moment how a=20=

response to my confessor child molester next to me, was stalled on the=20=

tarmac.  this individual  kept talking in slow mumbles.  we both kept=20
walking but in slower versions dragging our shadows into the past hour.=20=

  somewhere a brick fell on a vowel, the letters rearranged themselves=20=

into something that resembled jackson pollock=92s later struggles.  a=20
panic set in, mild at first, followed by a splattering of pain, mixed=20
with the coolness of the earth, foliage, fried eggs and meat, a=20
hodgepodge of letters that converged on a single vein, causing severe=20
blockage and then the conversation continued at a normal speed, as if=20
nothing ever occurred.
        I didn't want to answer any questions, it seemed imposed on the =
past,=20
a color before thought, a double dotted line and the beckoning buddha=20
bellies of sanctioned killers,  but what do I do when a statement is=20
thrown at me like -
        -I will dress you up as my own personal hypnotic inner link . . =
. I=20
will make you beg for chapter and verse . . .
        I could feel an air of superior aggression mounting from the =
inner=20
galactic,  I stopped and turned to this flaying image -
        -you are currently over your credit limit . . . do you really =
want=20
more? and can you handle me?  I promise you no one position is suitable=20=

. . . and not one orifices exist that I have not explored with entire=20
television crews . . .
        our conversation slowed to mutters and spits, turning into an =
alley we=20
unzipped each others blue jeans and pretended it was nothing more than=20=

identification tags.  mind you there=92s nothing like being fucked in an=20=

alley, up against a brick wall, a few years of slime clinging to your=20
face.  I  grabbed whatever part worked for me, shoving it into me like=20=

challenger in earth orbit.   I didn't bother to ask if it was real, it=20=

didn't matter, I paid the toll and passed go.  then it was my turn to=20
give advice, it seemed a symbol of duty and respect.  afterwards the=20
conversation seemed stale, the image faded to an old dog with three=20
legs.  I didn=92t know what I had done, or who I was talking to, all I=20=

knew was I could no longer feed this canine without teeth and three=20
legs.  though it's true,  individuals do carry on whole conversations=20
with mammals as if they are expecting and receiving answers, (the dog=20
barks or wags its tail and it=92s interpreted as a valentine for all=20
occasions) I wasn't sure if I could go there willy-nilly with a three=20
legged beast that just fucked me.
=09
        at that very moment a carousel  parade unit rounded the corner, =
a=20
public speaker raved in pride about representation of unity.  there was=20=

this cutting edge mockery right on the spot from the dog that had=20
fucked me just minutes before,  urinating there in a semi-tethic=20
practice on the oily spirits of the street.  I tried to ignore this=20
event and go on sitting with my marooned fantasies, where I have not=20
been able to separate out those that have shoes and those that lack=20
taste.  it was as I  became public with my disdain for positions and=20
certain fleshy parts that I would free myself from the wrist-hold the=20
nationalist breeder forces had with those  behavioral scientists in=20
everyone's pocket, that slapped flesh in a maze of a collection of=20
decadent calculations. my only salvation was to try to  maintain a=20
proustian state with its multi-faceted shapes, and with its glory for=20
higher bargains at the first international.

        looking down at this poor furry bastard next to me with the =
mobius=20
strip demeanor, I had no choice but take it to the carnival where queen=20=

of sheba was performing.  maybe once we were in the crowd it would get=20=

lost and find another companion, maybe it would find a cat to chase or=20=

a rat to eat.  as we approached the outskirts of funnel-cake town, a=20
float went by carrying sanctioned killers kissing their undefined=20

for war. everyone applauded and started reciting the pledge to the=20
flag.  already feeling a slight sickness creep into my lower intestines=20=

from the plague ala=92 stars-n-stripe brigade, like the time I tried to=20=

kill myself with an over dose of peptopsmal, and if that wasn=92t =

I was a character in a light comedy where the queen was a dictator with=20=

a little mustache, giving me direction in that swashbuckling manner. =20
fortunately there was a bookstore just this side of cotton-candy=20
village.  I ducked in hoping the image of the dog would fade or change=20=

channels.  I went straight for the 1950=92s, and yanked out an old page=20=

from =93a queen boy looking back,=94 just in case the queen approached, =

sucked in along with the drunken puppets, and old fry grease.  nothing=20=

        -honey, honey . . . oh my dear honey.
        I looked around for someone else who was answering the call to =

that the queen spent pulling out one hair at a time, sitting in front=20
of a child's mirror, the kind that looks like a little plastic night=20
stand for barbie, using a pair of tweezers, one hair at a time, usually=20=

about one hundred and fifty eight hairs in one sitting.

        I tried to forget those days and concentrate on potatoes, but =
every=20
time I would hear a mouse or a child scream, I would be reminded of=20
living in a san francisco studio apartment with the queen - with each=20
hair pulled there would be a little screech, a little squawk, a little=20=

squeak.  this was caused by the queen stepping outside the usual four=20
knots of the twelve knotted reality, landing in the brooklyn dust bowl=20=

at age five, alone and without a passport.  so I could excuse the hair=20=

universal manuals and started a collection of rakes before the air=20
turned to scrawler.

        I looked over my shoulder and saw a toothless pig talking to the =
three=20

chrome cock ring.  stroking the tiny rake pendent around my neck and=20

         I didn't want to watch any of this from anywhere, which seemed =

killers off to lunch, the queen of sheba was cutting through the=20

I think most people would say 'to create assonance' because they would not
think of the code having its own sound.

A printed text does not have sound either, yet we are accustomed to
discussing the assonance we know a printed text represents because we
instantly process the print text interface.  It has become transparent to
us.

I would think in the not too distant future ... the web interface will
appear more transparent ... that is if something doesn't replace the web
before that happens.

An example ... the first the comes to mind does, I think, involve Macromedia
code, but regardless -- miekal and's work with sound and mouseover events.

tempters are always courteous when paying court to Virtue
her humility would have loved this fretful music
- how many walls have been adorned with indignity?

poetic displacement is a wonderful concept to contemplate, Joe.  Nice word
choice.   It doesn't seem to have dawned on many that in making a public
spectacle of themselves here they are making a public spectacle?

I do happen to think this is a 'serious' issue, but one of process
'seriousness', rather than academic.

Great post, Catherine.  Your comment above reminds me of advice I've
heard re: adjunct survival:

1.  Never give anybody less than a B.

2.  Don't become too popular with the students (and thus threaten the
regular faculty).

Actually, the "B" advice is rather shaky, as once I gave a grad
student a B (I won't go into details, but it was a gift, she should
have failed) and she went to the dean about it.  Everybody I talked
with about her (tenured or adjunct) at this private, expensive school
said she was a horrid student, but they'd all given her As.  So, I'd
given a straight A student a B.

I think the only value one can feel in adjuncting is from the
students, but that's not a given, particularly if you're teaching a
course that they know is bullshit and you know is bullshit, as many
adjuncts find themselves doing.  This semester is a good one for me,
so I am feeling valued.  I'm lucky to be teaching creative writing,
not comp, or some other brain destroying stuff, but I think for
writing, to be effective, one has to have a lot of contact, and
adjuncts are given limited contact with students.  The one thing I'm
really liking about Antioch, even though it's a low-residency
program, I have intense contact with a few students, can really get
involved with their work and what they're trying to do.  Some of them
are blossoming, and that's so gratifying.  I don't take credit for
that particularly, it may simply be a function of focus and getting
attention.  I think getting attention can help people develop as
writers, and that's a value in teaching, simply giving attention.

And let's not forget there's hierarchy even among adjuncts, like some
of us get to teach grad students, some of us aren't allowed to.
There's a big difference between being a visiting writer and a
lecturer (I've been both), the visiting writer having lots more
status.  And then there's the associate faculty position, which I
have at Antioch, where everybody's part-time so I'm the real thing,
so to speak, and I'm treated very well, supported by the
administration.

Personally, I think people often develop the most in private
workshops, but they don't come out of it with a degree, just better
writing.

And I don't think of myself as an academic writer.  Teaching at this
level has no impact on my writing or position in the world as a
writer, other than taking up time, but at least it's usually
interesting, the time that's taken up.

i appreciate the discussion of academic superstardom, but even that
situation is more complex than it appears, in part b/c any number of
english depts don't have someone who might properly qualify for such
status (lots of englist depts. have no endowed positions, e.g.---my
dept here doesn't, and i'm at a 'major research institution')...

here's a great piece of writing by bruce robbins that pulls out the tangles:

Celeb-Reliance: Intellectuals, Celebrity, and Upward Mobility

http://www.iath.virginia.edu/pmc/text-only/issue.199/9.2robbins.txt

(i cite the text-only url for those w/o hopkins project muse access)...

i don't think we can tell who is/is not a "good teacher" based on
adjunct v. full-time status (anymore than one can assert, as andrew r
did a little while back, that "the teachers who are most committed to
literature" are "those in the community colleges"... man could *that*
one stand some unpacking!)...  if you look at the current ~us news~
list of the "best" postsecondary institutions in the country, the top
20 correlate pretty well and with few exceptions with those schools
that have the beefiest endowments (there are a number of factors that
go into the "best," yes, according to ~us news~---but it's much as if
endowments = best, one way or t'other)...

what we *can* assert is that life as an adjunct, as dodie and others
have observed, is not not not in general conducive to teaching well
(the absence of publication pressure and committeework
notwithstanding)... just have a look at the gymnastics most adjuncts
go through on most campuses to keep their prof. selves alive...

and they are most def. the lowest person on the institutional totem
pole, lower even than grad students (ta's or variants thereof) b/c
they don't even have customer status... now what happens when grad
students in english organize (as they are and should) and adjuncts
don't... oy... there are similar problems with the presence of a
union at one institutional level (grad studentdom) and none at the
next transitional level (facultydom)... loyalties might get a mite
messy in such terms, as one finds e.g. and under different conditions
when an hourly worker at a factory switches over to salary status
(i've seen this happen any number of times, and it's rarely a pretty
site)... which is not an argument against collective bargaining...

it's a sad picture i'm/we're painting, i know, and the only way out
that i can see is collective bargaining (which won't "fix" everything
either)... though as michael ceraolo posted in, even state law can
get in the way of organizing---which means we need reform at that
level too...

best,

joe

Dear Lewis,
                    as far as I'm aware beauty has a few fundamental
constants, eg
symmetry, balance, proportion,uniformity etc but as one builds on this
basis,
an artist or designer or poet will lose the original ideal depending on what
extra he or she has added
to the skeleton of the idea.
Generally a beautiful woman such as Brooke Shields or Heather Locklear have
a high degree of symmetry
in their faces and good proportions and uniformity of skin tone.
If one tries to translate that into a poem, there must be very strong rhyme(
that's the symmetry)
and repitition of internal and external assonance and alliteration,
basically everything must come
together perfectly.

Regards Tony Follari

Subject:      The President's Poetry
Comments: cc: newspoetry@lists.groogroo.com

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

When the guy who does the poetry show on the community radio station
announced his bid for congress as a Green Party candidate, the Democrats
demanded equal time. Now every other week the poetry show is all Maya
Angelou. Regular listeners are pissed but feel too guilty to phone in
complaints.

Here in Urbana the Champaign-Urbana Arts Council, reportedly well-endowed
with state money earmarked for poets, is not listed in the phone
directory. Nobody I talked to at the chamber of commerce or public library
knows who serves on its board or what exactly it does. It is suspected by
some poets who have been around a long time that the UAC gives a private
reading now and again to which a few wealthy people are invited, and that
the poet who hosts these events owns a ten-acre ranch up near Moraine View
and has never been published except by small presses whose identity
remains forever obfuscated from scholarship. It's the same story with the
mysterious "44 North:" occasionally you might read an article about them
in the mainstream papers, but you will never find their post office box or
fax number. Whatever projects these local arts organizations fund are
closely-held secrets.

During National Poetry Month there was no accountability at the state
level for how poetry was promoted or pursued. Without looking at the
state's overall poetry needs, politicians might arrange for a poet to give
a reading here, or a book signing there, doling out honorariums to
constituents well-placed in influential universities. There was no sense
of the state's having a larger plan for poetry, no broader vision
regarding the state's poetry infrastructure. (The situation downstate is
especially bad nowadays, even though the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book was once
published there.) There have been allegations of bribery and of poetic
licenses being distributed to writers who have not sat before the state's
rigorous thesis committee. Poets gave readings at closed-door sessions of
congress, state money effectively being using to fund readings closed to
the general public. Now the state has had to borrow several billion
dollars and there is no sign of any poetry anywhere. In public schools
they are reading light verse from the 1950s. With the budget cuts, the
state's major research university is no longer able to afford to retain
their best poets, much less hire new poets. Even novelists are leaving.
This on top of another tuition increase will make the university system no
longer attractive to prospective MFA candidates. Is there no
accountability? Governor Ryan should have his books confiscated by the
state and donated to public libraries. State planners involved in
allocating the funds for National Poetry Month should lose their positions
and serve time teaching poetry on death row to pay their debt to society.

At the federal level the situation is all but beyond hope. The President
of course has become poet laureate for a second term, the statute that a
laureate could serve only a single term having been overturned by the new
Office of Homeland Poetry (appointed not elected), which is headed up by a
major shareholder of the media conglomerate that owns the publisher who
publishes the President's poetry. In polls taken of the legislature, more
than half have stated unwaveringly that the President's poetry is beyond
criticism. It is worth noting that the house's opinion of the President's
poetry is divided along party lines suggesting that bipartisan bickering
is more at play then any serious appraisal of literary quality, not that
this is a surprise really. Scarcely credible to my mind, polls of public
opinion show an "overwhelming majority" appreciate the President's poetry,
though there is more public skepticism with regard to the quality of his
painting. Well, nobody needs to be reminded of the circumstances of the
President's being awarded the Yale Younger Poets prize at a time in his
life during which he has all but explicitly denied not abusing drugs and
cheating on exams: the recount was eventually completed but the results
were suppressed. The major newspapers of course are uncritical of the
president's poetry, save an occasional angry editorial buried in the
opinion section. If the political cartoons can be taken as meaningfully
indicative of a popular consensus, it would appear that few outside of the
circles of poetry power would claim that the President's writing is
credible. In an election year, of course, the President's poetry supplants
discussions of any other issue, especially an economy in which the average
family of four made about as much per year in 2001 as a Yale poet in 1970.

The President's poetry has been written about elsewhere, but it is the
stuff of death and broken dreams. The President's poetry mines the bottom
of oceans. Asphyxiation by poverty, exhaust, gas chambers. Millions of new
bombs. Fascism's cliche, the President's poetry is closed libraries,
unheated classrooms, prisons: ruined language.

Are we to accept as true that the average citizen thinks the President is
a good poet? Does anyone really believe that the President's poetry
represents our country? Are these the limits of discourse? Has literary
criticism failed?

but this isn't what i'm asking, tony....
it's a simple (and very old school) avant-garde
tactic...explore assymmetry, dissonance, find its
heart...
...my question would be, i guess, why does so much
"digital poetry" not do this? is "digital poetry"
doomed to operate with nineteenth century economies in
the post-electronic world? most "digital poetry" (and
i use this term to distinguish it from net art...or
"net art," if you will) adheres quite strictly to
nineenth century ideas of beauty as well as (though
many would blush to admit it) nineteenth century ideas
of structure...my question is, where is the new here?
what's new about "new media" such as this, when all it
does is repeat in a different format the ideology of
bygone eras?

Indeed, and perhaps said theoretical side would be significant without the
poetry side of it. Beyond the author or publisher identifying a text as one
or the other, or linebreaks or other stylistic indications, references to
Dante or Wittgenstein or whoever to classify a text, how do you distinguish
one type of text from the other when reading innovative writing? "(7) This
is not philosophy, it's poetry. And if I say so, it becomes painting, music
or sculpture, judged as such. If there are variables to consider, they are
at least partly economic- the question of distribution, etc. Also differing
critical traditions. Could this be good poetry, yet bad music? But yet I do
not believe I would, except in jest, posit this as dance or urban planning."
"(16) If this were theory, not practice, would I know it?" Ron Silliman,
from-The Chinese Notebook- in -The Age of Huts- Roof Books, 1986.

oh heavens,

you won't learn much about the conference itself from that. that's my blog
ettiquette in full force :)
i'm trying to figure out exactly what to say about the conference itself
because in terms of content, it was very disappointing.

anyhow, I will reserve those critical comments for the blog- given the recent
discussions on poetics about new media poetries, and the academy, I'm not
overly inclined to share my thoughts in this context- even though I know that
your interest, Maria, is genuine and informed and well-reasoned.

Nick -

Having a little trouble working out what is quotation from Ron and what is
your gloss in your post of this morning. I understand the wish to be
judged on merits, and more than that I empathize with the unstated wish
not to be judged -- to be responded to instead of categorized. And I read
the deletion of the introductory quotation mark as an embodiment of the
expressed wish to call into question the act of distinguishing between
texts. But surely this is more an act of power struggle than inquiry! OK!
You guys win. And gals too.

Would you say a poetics differs from a rule book? from a power struggle?

My point was that those who advance highest in the profession tend also to assign the least credibility to "poetry" or "literature" as categories of thought (they are much more likely to speak of "cultural production," for example).  If you go before an interviewing committee from a university and say, "I want to teach students to love literature," you will be met with skeptical gazes.  The same statement made before a comm coll hiring committee will probably be received well.  Now, it is perhaps also true that the c.c. teachers will squirm when they hear "cultural production" -- but, from my perspective, this difference has everything to do with the sociology of the profession, and little to do with intellectual sophistication.

But I'm not talking about competing jargons: "poetry" is a word with wide circulation and a relatively clear-cut meaning, at least insofar as it can be distinguished from other human activities.  The other phrase has significance only within the profession, where it usually serves as a badge to indicate one's status (or desired status -- all those wannabes at the MLA...).  As we move from talk about "poetry" to talk about "poetics" to talk about "cultural poetics" or "production," we rely more and more on the kind of educational capital whose only value is in the academic-professional marketplace.  C.c. teachers may have to pay lip service to the other professional shibboleths (about "diversity," "tolerance," etc.), and certainly it is true that many of them are mediocre, but where literature is concerned I think they can claim with some justification to be keeping it real (maybe because so many of them write the stuff).

Part One of an ongoing film and video series by Los Angeles curator and
film-maker Denise Portsman, these films and videos are the products of an
inquiry into a description of what "dirty" means in thirty seconds or less.
Out of this investigation came twenty-three very moving and beautiful
shorts, each 2 to 15 minutes in length. Highlights include: "Pulse" by John
Tipton and Stephen Dean, "Dirty" by John Tipton, "Twisted" by Simon
Thrilaway, "Fidel's Fight" by Lawrence Thrush, "Short Film" by Andrew
Steinman, and "Freaktion", an animated short by Normzee. Program time 60 min
approx.

WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 23 [8:00pm]
THE ARCHIVES BENEFIT
Recordings of many of the greatest 20th century poets are decades old and in
very fragile condition. If these recordings aren't restored and transferred
to other formats soon, they will be lost forever. Seeking ways to combat the
relentless decay of their magnetic tape archives, The Poetry Project and the
Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University, two of the
three poetry centers in the United States with the largest invaluable
collections of recordings, are hosting an Archives Benefit. All proceeds
will directly benefit The Poetry Project Audio Archive and the Naropa
University Audio Archive Preservation and Access Project, being used to
convert the precious analogue tapes into digital format.

The endangered archive collections contain thousands of hours of recordings
of authors and artists such as Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, Larry
Rivers, John Cage, Audre Lorde, Gregory Corso, Kenneth Koch, Barbara Guest,
Gwendolyn Brooks, Alice Walker, Spalding Gray, Andrei Voznesensky, Ted
Berrigan, Miguel Pinero, and a multitude of others.

Readers and performers will include Lou Reed, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo,
Jim O'Rourke, Anne Waldman, Steven Taylor, Kenward Elmslie and Yoshiko
Chuma. Sample tapes of historic readings will also be played.

***

Unless otherwise noted, admission to all events is $10, $7 for students and
seniors, and $5 for Poetry Project members. Schedule is subject to change.

The Poetry Project is located in St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery at 131 E.
10th Street, on the corner of 2nd Avenue in Manhattan. Trains F, 6, N, R.

The Poetry Project is wheelchair accessible with assistance and advance
notice. Please call (212) 674-0910 for more information, or e-mail us at

Lewis

assonance was merely an example, not meant to rule out dissonance.  I've
always liked chaos theory, in fact I find it quite beautiful.  saying that
new media poetry *can* use poetic effects is not saying that it must, merely
that parallels exist.

email correspondence is famous for taking task with that left unsaid as that
which is now assumed to be left unsaid for a purpose.  but I do find the
'isn't time we left ... etc' statement to be a bit nostalgic.  that has been
said of other art forms in much earlier times.

Alan. What's the point of all this?  Why arent you getting more involved
with things like Amiri Baraka does and stop this bourgeios Idealist stuff
and get involved in things like Amiri does?  I admire him especially inlight
of the recent revelations as sent by Scott Hamilton.

Also, why are so obssessed with numbers?

Yours faithfully, Richard Taylor.

Darkness between the deadline and ourselves.

I write this, my hands poised as if over a marionette, each depression of
key and corresponding letter adding incremental pressure to the air that
surrounds. My brow rippled like a mackerel sky, like the concentric
circles of a stone skipped across nervous water.

I poured coffee in a cup for my soul.

Today the Client stood, here, indifferent to the tortured cries of
practical time, and stated, in a clear voice engorged with blood, that
dates will not change, no matter the winds. His fingertips met like mating
seahorses. He closed his eyes and eschewed equivocation.

And so if, when the clock looks at once straight up and down, I have not
yet signed off on final layouts, your employment, like the perfume of she
who is unseen for days, will evaporate.

The enclosure of memory we came to call Johnson vs. The People of Ontario
has awakened again, like a bear whose hunger calls out, like the engine of
a Fokker triplane escaping its hangar.

My eye alongside its memory.

In advance of a gathering, you will rise from your tasks. And soon. You
will rise and comb the drawers of silent recollection, and gather into
expanding envelopes the colour of an infant’s gifts the leaves of foolscap
that belong. That speak. Past.

Subject: Amiri Baraka in the NY Times Report from NZ


I dont think Amiri Baraka should resign. There's a stupid attitude fostered
that people cant talk about S11 because some poeple got killed. Well for
that reason you may as well censor every poem  writtem  eg Wallace Stevens's
poem "In a Nigger Cemetary.." and so on. In fact it is quite possible that
the Isaelli secret service cooperated with the US CIA etc in the plot of S11
and in fact it could have included even some so-called Al Qaeda. It could
very easily be an iside job and we know that the US Govt gives Israel
US$billions in actual cash and military hardware each year (otherwise it
wouldnt survive).  I doubt that Baraka is anti-semitic per se: maybe he is,
but the way that Israel is trying to exterminate the Palestinians this is
not surprising: Black people who are politically intelligent would empathise
with the plight of the Palestinians. And the reaction to Baraka's poem shows
the hypocrisy of the stuffed shirt "upholders of he public good". And Sharon
is in fact basically a war criminal having been responsible for at least one
massacre and in my book so is Bush and so is Blair: Blair was satirised
recently...he uses a wierd, disconnected language. The British press
journalists (on a BBC programme I saw) in fact have said that they can never
get him to say anything that is meaningful. He and Bush are like Punch and
Judy but they're on the same side.  The rhetoric of a cowboy from the East
and then the non-speak or triple speak of Blair the wonder boy from...god
knows where.

I think that its quite possible the Isarelis together with US helped carry
out the S11 to lubricate their campaign against the Palestinians.

I would like to see Israel destroyed. It is a group of invadors and
criminals who are not from that area: they are agressive and vicious...they
dont belong there. They are aliens. They are Europeans mostly who arent from
that place. Or they are but only in as much as everyone is originally from
Africa.

A compromise seems impossible: for their own survival the Arabs should get
together and obliterate the Israelis. Its quite clearly the only way. It
would be good if Hussein had nukes - really - the Israelis would not be so
keen to brutalise. Like the Nazis they dont know where or when to stop so
like them they need to be driven out ... Baraka is right to speak out on
these matters as Mohammed Ali did in the Vietnam war days.

But that doesnt mean that he has a "duty" to. And in fact I realise now that
Merwin's  rhetoric applies to "person" not just poet as some very great
poets have been a-political, probably a-moral (or their morality is
"screwed") ... I dont think there is any moral imperative. So one does takes
a position: and Baraka's is one. People who want him to resign are like
those people who didnt like the teaching of Darwin: or who suppress eg von
Daniken or whoever... or should we supress Mein Kempf: if someone wants to
read Mein Kempf well that's their business - on the reverse side of the coin
I think that Salaman Rushdie should be allowed to write his Satanic verses
and so on.

I'm not very intersted in Baraka's poetry, but I'm glad he's taking a strong
stand.  Richard Taylor.

here hypocrites is a holiday stamp,  the last room next to my assassin.
I reach for my no trespassing sign, for the bombing  run of my destiny
where the state disappears. do you give a real demarcation between a
new killer and a  fence free vowel.  lend me the sea, a sniper's
bullet, a room that has no claws, I don't want to be trapped in asylum
yellow, a savors prayer,  the noise of everywhere without edges. its a
million staples per pore,  horses on fire. here hypocrites is a
sniper's bullet that missed, a room next to my own lend-lease history
darkened in pit of someone else's  last rites. an autopsy mortgage on
the present or  the last room of someone else's  document.  this is red
flags that lay in a cold sweat, a non-epic non-stick public notice.

Does this 1984 statement by Rothenberg (reprinted on the UbuWebsite that Pierre Joris mentions) qualify as literary globalism?

"The inherited view ‹ no longer bearable ‹ was that one such idea of poetry, as developed in the West, was sufficient for the total telling. Against this ‹ as the facts, the poems themselves, revealed ‹ was the realization that poetry, like language itself, existed everywhere: as powerful, even complex, in its presumed beginnings as in many of its later works. In the light of that approach, poetry appeared not as a luxury but as a true necessity: not a small corner of the world for those who lived it but equal to the world itself."

(see http://www.ubu.com/ethno/index.html)

If so, then from Rothenberg's account we can infer that globalism is, ironically, first of all an awareness of cultural _deficiency_.  We become aware, in other words, that our native literary tradition is necessarily limited in outlook.  We realize that we have been subjected to the haphazard of birth, and that to grasp the "total telling" we must outstrip such arbitrary constraints.  Globalism as humility: that would seem to be one theme that poetry might contribute to the political debates...

My Dear Sir,

As I sit here dripping in lace cuffs, brass buttons, silk stockings, =
wearing my Tricorn proudly..=20
I recoil from your constant attentions to breed art under the rubric of =
the "absolutely new".. As any fool can plainly see, "new media" is =
precisely that,
new mediums, polymeric paint to replace the earthen ochres, abstractions =
to replace the figure/ground.. but what would you have us do, we are =
still the same emoting human vehicles as were the artists who sat in =
attendence in Egyptian tombs, nearly the same as those who bravely =
daubed in the caves of Lascaux.. As I sat here tonight watching Eric =
Rohmer's "The Lady and The Duke" on DVD, I was completely and =
wonderfully charmed by Mr. Rohmer's use of digital effects to produce a =
cinematic painting.. If only today's artists had half the skill and =
integrity of their 19th century counterparts! or their 18th, or 17th, or =
16th, or 15th, etc etc.. I would gladly watch Goya's attempt at a Flash =
Movie, and would stand in line to see the miracle of a weeping =
animatronic statue of a Greuzian urchin weeping for a tromp l'oeil dead =
bird.. Perhaps your lament for the "new" should be replaced with a =
lament for the skill and determination of our fallen brother and sister =
artisans and artists whose work makes all of ours possible.. This search =
of yours for the absolutely new, is akin to some kind of aesthetic =
Jacobinism. I would gladly breed new animals upon this world were I =
able, but be sure I would produce centaurs, cyclopes, and feathered =
flying snakes in honor of the creative imagination of all my artist =
sisterbrother's throughout history who haunt me every minute of every =
day with their sheer and neversilenced genius.. I hope you find your new =
media, but as for me I await the return of the pteradactyl and the soft =
murmuring of the oracle upon her tripod! For Mayan priests raining blood =
from their feathered zeppelins.. For Cyclopian children riding a Mickey =
Mouse Titan through the river styx to safety.. For Astronauts in =
powdered wigs.. For cavemen eating soyburgers on floating hoverdiscs.. 5 =
minutes of new is not worth 500 million years of vocabulary =
development.. I hope you find your absolute newness, as for me I would =
prefer to gaze into the eyes of the gorgon.. which being completely =
impossible would be absolutely new!=20

About a month ago, amidst the flurry of URLs for various
poetry-related blogs were posted to the list, I came across a
discussion of Harry Partch's ideas about setting texts, from a
poetics POV rather than a musical one.

Recently I've looked at the 5-6 URLs for blogs I found back then & I
couldn't find this.

Is there anyone on the list who can point me to the right blog for this?

Thanks.

Seriously! I'm aware of the distinction between a poetics and a
sensibility, but am unaware of texts where the differentiation is spelled
out. How do these competing ways to describe the faculty of
being-about-to-write, or if you prefer, the subject position of poet,
differ?

both within and without the academy. For the past 6 semesters a =
colleague and I have co-taught a class (as adjuncts) at the community =
college level. To disentangle the multiplicities of our motivations =
might be something akin to dissecting a kaleidoscope. Essentially, it =
stemmed from a desire to actively employ access that we have on several =
different levels within larger institutions and extend these resources =
to students whose access is diminished predominantly by relations of: =
class, age, gender, geographical location and educational experience =
(GED, inadequate public schooling, learning disabilities, ESL, etc.)
Perhaps it bears iterating that (generally)  C.C. students are somewhat =
different from undergraduates entering larger institutions as freshman, =
though they frequently transfer in and often benefit tremendously from =
the C.C. experience.=20
In this situation we transformed the class by subverting the =
pre-existing curriculum, changing the texts and radicalized the =
underlying philosophy of the content we are charged with imparting to =
our students. We have been able to do this by consciously employing many =
of the aspects implicit to the adjunct experience. We have a high degree =
of autonomy due to many of the issues that have been voiced in this =
ongoing discussion.=20

I agree that adjuncts are underpaid, disenfranchised, etcetera ad =
infintum and yet, there has been a tendency throughout this discourse to =
cast us/them as pariahs who *should* organize or refuse to adjunct or =
somehow buck the system. Perhaps it is possible to buck the system =
within it when you begin from a conscious stance of what is not =
available to those students who are largely *outside* it. The situation =
of management, labor rights, and options are incredibly convoluted. 98% =
of my students are women. 60% of them are women with children. 10% of my =
students have significant learning disabilities. Many of my students =
live in poverty and just to get to school is a radical move on their =
part. 100% of my adjunct colleagues are women. I find these statistics =
extremely interesting to say the least. As a woman.=20

There is a trend that I have noticed (or tendency, as the case may be) =
for C.C.'s locally to hire one person as department head and for that =
person to teach the bulk of the coursework and then sub-contract to a =
network of adjuncts to deliver the rest of the curriculum. There is a =
high level of turn over, burn out, etc. My colleague and I have =
attempted to negotiate opportunities to network with our adjunct peers =
and have been somewhat thwarted in this endeavor, but we intend to press =
on. The thing that keeps drawing us back is: our commitment to the =
students. And the subversion that is possible when working in this =
manner. Perhaps in some infinitesimal way we have begun the work of at =
least attempting to organize the adjuncts, to raise the standard of what =
we expect from our students and by initiating access to larger =
institutions for them by the resources, opportunities, methodology and =
content that we deliver. =20

Some things in this thread have smacked of elitism. Which only serves to =
further divide us and undermine the possibility of reforming the current =
situation. Whether one considers oneself to be *inside* or *outside* the =
academy or navigating the interstices, what makes our work relevant is =
what our intentions are and how we employ them in practice.=20

Hi Jordan:

Thanks for your response to my post on poetry and theory. Alex Young had
made the point that L=A poetry would have been significant without the
theoretical work done by these poets. I agreed, but also suggested the
reverse might be true as well, that is, the discussions of ideas brought
about by these writers would be a worthwhile contribution standing on its
own without the poetry. I brought in the quotes by Silliman to illustrate
and underline the point that many L=A poets were interested in blurring the
distinctions between areas of thought and writing, that is, not splitting
one off from the other. On the other hand many of those writers were
sometimes quite happy leaving the traditional distinctions as they were/are
(a point Bob Perelman makes in a recent interview.) My point was that if you
removed the covert cues that distinguish between genres in contemporary
writing, often you couldn't tell them apart. When performed intentionally,
this has traditionally been characterized as prose poetry. I confess it was
quite early in the morning when I wrote my post and I was bleary eyed. Sorry
for the unintentional confusion. Also, In no way was I detracting or arguing
with Alex Young's point. No power struggles intended. It's just that my
feeling was in the 70's, and is now, that I liked when the L=A poets did not
sneer at incorporating complex theoretical ideas and conceptualizations,
critical writing, or philosophical writing into their discussions and
writing work. With all due respect to the late Kenneth Koch, his point that
"we know all that already" about Wittgenstein to me illustrates the wish on
the part of some poets to sustain a split between poetry and philosophy,
between the nerdy and the cool, which, in my view, helps lead to the tedious
dumbing down procedures which have turned the minds of some our best poets
into peanut butter and jelly (nothing against peanut butter and jelly) when
they go to put their ideas into words, particularly long words ("boring")
and complex ideas ("academic").

I brought in the Ron Silliman quotes because they so clearly and succinctly
explicate the tendency towards splitting in the arts and U.S. culture in
general. One more time:

"(7) This is not philosophy, it's poetry. And if I say so, then it becomes
painting, music or sculpture, judged as such. If there are variables to
consider, they are at least partly economic- the question of distribution,
etc. Also differing critical traditions. Could this be good poetry, yet bad
music? But yet I do not believe I would, except in jest, posit this as dance
or urban planning."

"(16) If this were theory, not practice, would I know it?"

Both quotes are from -The Chinese Notebook- in -the Age of Huts- Roof Books,
1986.

In his useful and thorough elucidation of Silliman's discussion of Bruce
Andrews' "Lip Service" Alex Young notes:

> David Shapiro made an interesting comment at the memorial reading =
> for Kenneth Koch the other day...he said he gave Koch some Wittgenstein =
> to read and Koch read it and said "don't we know all this already?"  =

Actually, the dichotomy Alex speaks of here has long been very fashionable
and continues to be. The L=A poets' attempt to juxtapose types of thinking
and areas of intellectual activity has always been unfashionable in most
sectors of US intellectual life and continues to be, despite whatever
postmodern (soon to be postmodem) developments; there are strong
professional sanctions that guarantee the continued firm application of
intellectual boundaries and distinctions between professionalized
intellectual activities. Speaking of inside/outside the academy, I just
realized that this discussion is a tributary of that thread, an apparently
unstoppable river!

> Would you say a poetics differs from a rule book? from a power struggle?
(Jordan)

Yes, mostly, but I'd appreciate it if you would elaborate on this question a
bit. I would like to respond more fully.

Thanks for that marvelous description of the recent Ken Jacobs performance,
NP!

Re. Jacobs. I don't know how many people know this but the marvelous
filmmaker and artist also writes poetry, and a very strange poetry at that:
-- in stereoscopic 3D! Not many people can see this effect in his poetry --
I cannot myself, unfortunately, after many tries -- but supposedly if you
position your eyes a certain way you can actually read the two columns of
text at once in a kind of virtual deep space that brings them together in
interesting ways. If this effect works anything like his Nervous System
pieces, it would be a major breakthrough of sorts that should demand greater
attention amongst new media poets. At least I think so.

As far as other artists writing poetry is concerned, I would highly
recommend the conceptualist Carl Andre. I don't know any poet who has taken
what he has done in words as far as he has taken it, and his
semi-algorithmic approach seems to fit in well with today's sensibilities. I
wish somebody would publish a book of his poems. He was quite prolific, it
seems, and the ones I have read are extraordinary.

It's a shame to have to carry on this conversation-in-public in such a
chess-by-mail fashion -- I just know we'll be about to get somewhere by
the end of your reply, and we'll both have exhausted our daily quota of
airtime. Still, carry on we must.

Alex quoted David accurately. His assessment of Kenneth's (and by proxy
the non-Language poetry world's) involvement with theory is less acute.
The only time I've been in the presence of a full run of the low numbers
of Tel Quel was at Kenneth's. His poem "Straits" is a reading-through of
Shklovsky. I'd compare his attitude toward Wittgenstein to that he
maintained toward Beckett, or Language poetry, for that matter -- at best
these were sophisticated rehashings of material others had worked over
more profitably. (I didn't and don't share this view; I prefer to think
that I just haven't had certain conversion experiences yet, viz Beckett.
Wittgenstein I have always read as the funniest writer since Reader's
Digest.) I would also offer a slightly different attitude that he would
sometimes take toward Wittgenstein, Benjamin, and Derrida -- that these
authors were occasionally as attentive and therefore worth engaging as say
Barthes, but that their *use*, their appropriation by their academic
supporters, made it difficult to avoid a defensive reaction.

I take it from your subject line that you would prefer to address my
comments indirectly: I wrote in a previous message on this endless subject
of how we speak of the activity of writing that an idealized discourse
that crosses genres and .. wait, I can cut and paste with the best of
them:

I also believe that that idealized discourse has been abandoned not only
by the non-academic presses, but by those best equipped to generate it.
In its place we have a terminally nerdy cascade of proper names,
groupings, and anthology tables-of-contents.


This is a different complaint from Kenneth's remark about Wittgenstein,
but you're right that it has the same structure. We both are identifying
wastes of time -- probably in self-defense. I know that the paper I chewed
in my early youth was bubble-gum flavored and printed dimly with earned
run averages, slugging percentages. Kenneth was probably aware of some
tendency he had to over-analyze (the capacity to find sense in nonsense,
or rather the tendency to make artificial distinctions and then act as if
they didn't exist, that Alex mentioned) and to skip logical connections
that he would have been impatient with in Wittgenstein. I was aware when I
wrote that that Mark's complaint about the decline of the publishing
opportunities for Poetics applied only to a very proscribed view of the
activity of thinking and writing about the practice of poetry.

But we are talking so much about a writer of the past!

We are both in our posts talking about differentiation mechanisms. Or
processes. Oh the things Wittgenstein said about processes! (What follows
is from the Philosophical Investigations)

303. "I can only believe that someone else is in pain, but I know' it if I
am." -- Yes: one can make the decision to say "I believe he is in pain"
instead of "He is in pain". But that is all. What looks like an
explanation here, or like a statement about a mental process, is in truth
an exchange of one expression for another which, while we are doing
philosophy, seems the more appropriate one.

Just try -- in a real case -- to doubt someone else's fear or pain.

304. "But you will surely admit that there is a difference between pain --
behavior accompanied by pain and pain -- behavior without any pain?" --
Admit it? What greater difference could there be? -- "And yet you again
and again reach the conclusion that the sensation itself is a nothing." --
Not at all. It is not a something, but not a nothing either! The
conclusion was only that a nothing would serve just as well as a something
about which nothing could be said. We have only rejected the grammar which
tries to force itself on us here.

The paradox disappears only if we make a radical break with the idea that
language always functions in one way, always serves the same purpose: to
convey thoughts -- which may be about houses, pains, and evil, or anything
else you please.

305. "But you surely cannot deny that, for example, in remembering, an
inner process takes place." -- What gives the impression that we want to
deny anything? When one says "Still, an inner process does take place
here" -- one wants to go on: "After all, you see it." And it is this inner
process that one means by the word "remembering". -- The impression that
we wanted to deny something arises from our setting our faces against the
picture of the 'inner process'. What we deny is that the picture of the
inner process gives us the correct idea of the use of the word "to
remember". We say that this picture with its ramifications stands in the
way of our seeing the use of the word as it is.

306. Why should I deny that there is a mental process? But "There has just
taken place in me the mental process of remembering...." means nothing
more than: "I have just remembered ....". To deny the mental process would
mean to deny the remembering; to deny that anyone ever remembers anything.

307. "Are you not really a behaviorist in disguise? Aren't you at bottom
really saying that everything except human behavior is a fiction?" -- If I
do speak of a fiction, then it is of a grammatical fiction.

(Here ends the reading from Wittgenstein -- Friends believe the good
news!)

Every writer chooses whom they read. And every writer chooses the terms
they use to sort out what they'll read -- I'm interested in your terms
"boring" and "academic", as well as "peanut butter and jelly" it being
12:40 of a Friday. I'd say it's willful to argue that Language poetry
heals the split between poetry and philosophy, it never having occurred in
the first place. And I'd call the late Allen Ginsberg a horrible nerd,
too! But I liked him, even if he did scandalize my grandmother at the
event I dragged her to after graduation. Maybe especially because! The
issue here is time -- and attention. We each want our time that we give
over to writing these strange (or to use your term "innovative") works to
lead to further insight, to growth and understanding. No fair saying one
side wants that more than another. Structural analyses of who gets what
airtime (I'll come out and say I'm thinking of Jed Rasula's NCTE book, but
the same type of argument has been made by most of our more eminent
critics) are best left to the marketing department, and come to think of
it they're hardly nerds up there, probably the cutest group in the
company. Sigh. And we'll be closing...

Lexicon Lake
After the dream this part comes. This part comes after the dream. After
the dream, this part. Part of why. Part of the head space where you feel
like a stranger in your own mind. Part of feeling like a lost kite
floating over indifferent suburbs. Over dog shit and swimming pools. Down
every street that has hosted a bicycle accident. Have you been lifted out
of a dream and allowed to watch yourself sleep? Tracing the contours of
your scars without making yourself flinch. You remember a memory. A smell,
an odour, a broken bottle of cologne. It has soaked in to the fabric. It
will not leave you and you will not ask it to leave. It leaked in to your
dream this morning and it has remained all day. Floating like a question
afraid of the wrong answer, you are tentative. If you close you eyes in
your sleep will vision become visions? Bring your arms in tight and feel
the speed. Swoop down. Spiral out. Fast. Are you terrified? I love it.
Slip in to the wind.  Trapped in an alphabetic labyrinth like swimming in
language. The lexicon lake. Call out and listen for: Stroke. Stroke.
Stroke. Sink. Think your way out of it. Get higher. Let evocative notions
be your guide to awareness. Emotions like motions owe prayers to the
source. Seek out. Wear trust like a blanket knit by the woman who raised
your favourite uncle. Wrapped up in wonder. Feel yourself as if stitched
into a seam, simultaneously in and out. In and out of control. Is there
control? Are there elastic bands glued to your teeth that snap your jaws
shut when you scream? Is there a wooden broom handle behind your elbows
causing you to stumble when you run? Don't fall. But I'm flying, you
remember. Does this part come after the dream?  After this part comes the
dream.

(2001) 30:00 min.

"TONGUES DON'T HAVE BONES: A Journey into Burma",
looks behind the facade
of censorship and iron control put into place by
Myanmar's military regimes. Since 1962 Burma has been
ruled by army-controlled dictatorships. "Tongues"

"WHICH WAY IS EAST: Notebooks from Vietnam"
by Lynne Sachs in collaboration with Dana Sachs (1994)
33 min.

"Lynne and Dana Sachs' travel diary of their trip to
Vietnam is a collection of tourism, city life, culture
clash, and historic inquiry.  WHICH WAY IS EAST starts
as a road trip and flowers into a political
discourse. It combines Vietnamese parables, history
and memories of the people the sisters met, as well as
their own childhood memories of the war on TV. The
film has a combination of qualities: compassion, acute

observational skills, an understanding of history's
scope, and a critical ability to discern what's
missing from the textbooks and TV news."  (from
The Independent Film and Video Monthly)

The House of Drafts (www.house-of-drafts.org), a
Bosnian-American web collaboration by Lynne Sachs and
Jeanne Finley with selected works by Alma Suljevic and
Tvico Muhidin. (15 min. tape compilation)

"HOUSE OF DRAFTS/  DOM PROMAHA is a virtual apartment
building inhabited by the imaginary characters created
by a group of Bosnian and American media artists. The
project is shaped by autobiographical experiences
filtered through poetic reflections, original music,
and video imagery. From a performance artist who
moonlights as a de-miner to a traveler caught by the
inferno of a burning library-these short works express

Sarajevo, a Balkan city now mending after a tumultuous
decade of civil war.

andy, i would be willing to have a discussion of the problems with
academic theory, which (might) turn first and foremost on the
inability of many academics to codeswitch (let's say) when they
address the public sphere proper... or even the inclination, or
better, lack of inclination to do so (setting aside, that is, the
opportunity)...

but i wish i didn't feel it necessary to put on my flame-retardant
flak jacket in having said discussion... so much of what you say
takes direct aim at an institution i'm interested in trying to
reform---for as long as i collect a paycheck therein...

what do *you* do for a living, anyway?... my .edu is revealing, no?
whereas your .net tells me only that you're probably not an academic
worker...

seems to me you wish to bring discussions of poetry backward, not
forward, to a kinder, gentler, and probably more mystified realm (and
i'm all for humilitas mself, btw)... your characterization of
community college instructors sounds a mite condescending (at least),
and is certainly absent any awareness, it seems, of that tangle
implied by suggesting that "poetry" (v. e.g. "cultural production") =
a love of literature (i love literature too, which is why i write it
(i think)---and no, i honestly don't think i'm a self-loathing
academic OR writer)...

don't know how to proceed past this point if you continue to cling to
such notions, andy... and just for the record:  i'm more interested
(in my classrooms) in helping students to become "better" people than
"better writers," albeit in a writing classroom, this task takes on
distinctively grammatical proportions (in the largest sense, as
opposed say to mathematical)... and if one interviews for a creative
writing position here at cu, yours truly is likely to pitch precisely
that question (not that answering it contra moi will ipsoid factoid
jeopardize one's candidacy either)... just for the record...

best,

joe

Dear Nick and George and all,

I don't get it actually.  I feel like a drunk wasp (bee to you
guys)circling a saucer of jam (jelly to you guys).  George says:
"I mean that Plath, Swenson, etc. were not excluded because they were
women; they were excluded for the same reason that X.J. Kennedy and
Robert Lowell were excluded."
Nick, I'm definitely not most people because I don't get it.  What could
the "same reason" be that excluded both May Swenson and Robert Lowell?
Certainly it can't be aesthetic. I don't even know what the "same
reason" would be in the case of Lowell and Plath.  But help me out here.
 George hoped I was joking when I suggested May Swenson but I wasn't.
I'm not surprised she's not included in Allen's anthology (or Cary
Nelson's anthology), because I've got used to the idea of a group of
low-anthologizable poets (my latest batch includes Swenson, Dugan,
(James) Tate, and Ntozake Shange). In fact I'm currently interesting a
major (poetry) publisher in an anthology of low-anthologizables.
Anyway, I'm not joking.  Although I confess it's so long ago and in such
another country that I read Donald Allen's anthology I have clean
forgotten everything but the cover, so ignorant I may be, but not
joking.
Mairead

Touche,
             the genre-bending issue issue is an important part of this
debate, and i wish i had more time to hash it out now; i'm hoping to write a
thesis about LangPo and genre bending next year.  But a couple of quick
points.
           Nick--I love the cool/nerdy dichotomy in this, i could write a
whole 'nother essay on the word cool.  I think the whole idea, which i
assume came into popular usage in the 50s (?) is very much attatched to the
(uniquely American?) sense of autonomous individual identity evolving around
that time--in an age where identity was becoming increasingly blurred within
a society becoming increasingly connected (homoginized?) thru mass media
etc.  Cool is not so much about avoiding big ideas as it is about avoiding
self-consciousness; avoiding (or masking!) an awareness of the artificiality
of identity.
           When you go to a Bob Dylan concert, he doesn't even talk on
stage.  Thats how cool he is.  Everything is in the music, baby.  Thats why
Bob Dylan is the coolest guy around.  As Kurosawa (a really cool film maker)
says in his autobiography, "saying anything more would be like drawing legs
on a snake."
           The Beat Generation was pretty damn cool, or so we liked to
think--"first thougt best thought" was really cool (tho it certainly wasn't
a reality), because it demonstrated that one's identity was consistent overe
time, something happened to you in a moment, and there's no reason to change
that, your consistent and natural identity has no need to impose what it
thinks today on what it thought yesterday.
           But Cool is dangerous--consistency is hard to maintain--Jack
Kerouac was cool.  Jackson Pollock was cool.  Jim Morrison was cool.  What
happens when you don't identify any more with the construct that defines you
so completeley to the rest of humanity?
            Enough on coolness--onto the nerds.  I agree that mainstream
academia wants very much to remain rooted in the platonic tradition of
Western consciousness--criticism remains a "metalanguage" to borrow Ron's
term.   Lets go to the old OED for a look at "metalanguage"--"A language
which supplies terms for the analysis of an 'object' language; a system of
propositions about other propositions."  But then also from the humble
American Heritage we get this definition of "meta" which I think also sheds
some light on how we use the term: "Beyond; transcending; more
comprehensive: metalinguistics."
        The nerd identity is dependent on a sort of Kantian distance from a
distinct discourse that allows them to claim the "meta" (read "transcendent,
above").  Their discourse, to maintain its sort of Socratic purity (see the
Ion) must remain anti-performative.

        So, now we have a situation where contemporary theory, by means of
this metalanguage, has stumped itself, and come to a point where its own
rhetoric is forcing it into a more performative, and on the more practical
side, a less grammatical and directly logical, approach. (y'all will have to
accept my apology for the gross oversimplifications; i think thhey work for
the point i'm trying to make, but feel free to object). And so Derrida
writes ""Of Grammatology", and later he writes "Glas", and today I go to
amazon.com to maybe buy the latter, find out its out of print and would set
me back 50 bucks, find that "Of Grammatology" is the amazon "Featured Item"
and can be picked up for around 20.
        Why, you're asking, would the public consume such a theoretically
obtuse book like Of Grammatology while such a formally innovative one like
Glas is neglected?  Why does Bernstein's book My Way (which I love) contain
some essays with anti-syntactical moments, some in verse, and others in
prose that would be more than acceptable in any mainstream academic
publication? (consequently, there's a brilliant discussion of this issue in
regards to Derrida in Perloff's "Wittgenstein's Ladder" Chapter II)
         I think the answer is simple--neither Derrida nor Bernstein (nor
Ginsberg, for that matter!) is willing to take the plunge totally divorce
themselves from that sort of Kantian meta/transcendent identity--even if
they, in theory, don't privledge their theoretical practice over their
performative textual practice.  Derrida's ouvre, and the work of the
language poets, is read in Academic settings as a scientific article might
be read:  you have the "raw data"--the "non-sensical" (or in any way
innovative) textual practice, but don't worry, because at the end of it all
the "scientist/artist" will neatly explicate his findings for you in this
perfectly lucid piece of academic writing.
         How in the world can a poet resist this kind of characerization,
the dreaded "Language Poetry as the justification of the theory" problem?
In some ways I think the New York School model is attractive--just be a real
pain in the ass when anyone wants you to explain it--I'm sure Ashbery reads
a whole lot of theory (i was totally shooting from the hip there but its a
hypothetical point), but you would never get him to admit it, at least not
in a public forum, and certainly not in a journal entitled "N=E=W Y=O=R=K."
But then its problematic too, I think people tend to take it the wrong way,
thus the legions of peanut-butter-and-jelly aspiring and vapid New York
School poets haunting lower manhattan.
         I think the new generation of American poets will have to directly
confront the "frames" of poetics and practice and alter them utterly if they
want to avoid being read like the New York School or The Language Poets (tho
both these movements are still alive and kicking).  I see a continuing
importance for poetics and theoretical discourse, but I think the idea of
reading as a metadiscourse has to be continually questioned, whether the
reading exists in the frame of poetry or poetics.  I think the frame of
poetics could also be intentionally downsized by readers and poets to avoid
the kind of "scientific article" readings of  a poets work that are
prevelent in academia today.  I think the specter of the New Critics'
"well-wrought urn" (I dunno who said that, its always just sort of been in
the air--does anyone know?) is a little too fresh in the LangPo theoretical
consciousness.  I think in the future it would be great if the theoretical
discourse produced by LangPo was read as an important part of the movement,
but ultimately a part with a limited audience that plays a secondary role to
that which is placed in the frame of poetry.  I think more of the
ideological goals overtly stated in LangPo theory would be better achieved
by having Hejinian's Essay "My Life" isolated in a higschool anthology (or
better yet, one of those "Best Loved Poems" books!) than by making a few
high level English majors read "Rejection of Closure," and then if they have
time take a look at some of  "My Life", which she has conviently interpreted
for them in the essay.   Cheers,

in a very telling typo, I accidentally wrote "Hejinian's essay 'My =
Life'" instead of "Hejinian's poem 'My Life'" in my last post--but maybe =
it would have been better to play it off as intentional.  adios

Chax Press has its own domain now, although we're a few weeks away from
having the site updated. I hope all of you who have links to the site will
see this and change the links appropriately, including the links from the EPC.

The new site address is <http://chax.org>  (with or without a www in the
URL, it works)

Also, I hope those of you in southern California are able to see our work
on display at Univ. of Redlands. Please send me an email for directions.
Redlands is on the far outskirts of the Los Angeles metro area, near San
Bernardino. Besides my work in books, there are three amazing sewn pieces
by Katherine Kuehn of Salient Seedling Press. In one of these works, a wide
and very long cloth hangs from the ceiling to the floor and then flows
along the floor in waves. On that cloth, the text of Lorine Niedecker's
Paean to Place has been sewn, after which the cloth has been died with
indigo; then, after the dying, the stitches of the poem have been removed,
leaving the image of the poem which is there as much by absence as by
presence, which seems appropriate for this Niedecker poem. As far as my
work in this show, it includes Chax Press handmade books since about 1986
as well as books by some other presses with which I have worked. One corner
of the Peppers Art Gallery at Redlands also has a table of non-fine-art
books for browsing, a CD player set up for listening to some collaborations
I have done with composer Chuck Koesters of Orts Theatre of Dance, other
CDs of poetry readings, and two videos of multimedia collaborations with
Orts Theatre of Dance.

I don't think the exhibition is currently set to travel outside of
Redlands; however, if any of you on this list have contacts with exhibition
spaces and might like to bring this show to you, please email me at
<chax@theriver.com>.

Thanks,

Charles

Alan. A subconscious or maybe a conscious anxiety: look I dont think that
anyone hates Americans any more or to any greater extent than anyone hates
any other national or ethnic group.  You havent, I know, responded to my
last email (as such) which was tongue in cheek,  but your response to my
Baraka thing I felt was quite naive, so I took a dig at all your "numbers"
(by the way I like the idea of the blocks of numbers and like the idea of
what you are doing in the poetry area) : look I think that your project and
langauge poetry and poetry and the various poetic practices and the stuff
coming on line now by various poets...I'm not as good a poet , or I dont
have the "ideas" maybe they have or the energy....those poems and poetics I
repeat are brilliant: truth is I am possibly as prone as anyone else to
being "non-political" and wanting to duck away: I am disturbed very much by
the world situation, well  enough to ear-bash people,...trouble is I never
learnt the polite language that so-called middle class people use and also -
I admit it - I'm not a good listener, I do tend to harrangue I know I do:
but that said, if I feel strongly about some injustice I tend to throw
caution to the winds (and maybe at times I "lose it") but a) I like what you
and Nick and the others writing poetry etc are all doing 2) I dont see how
my political ideas (which have some correlation to Hilton Obenzerger's
("Richard's got a point")) should lead you and Nick to fly into a rage or a
"snit" against me.  Its almost as if many of those such as yourself and
Perloff  and Nick and Ron -and I admire these peoples' ideas and sensitivity
and their poetry and their originality etc and poetics: cant accept that
someone who is "outside" can dare have right to assert ideas that MIGHT just
be true and I suspect that in regard to Baraka that there is an element of
racism aginst him: I dont think that it is anti-semitism as a backlash of
racism against black people and Baraka. Or maybe that's not so, but its
something maybe to think about...

These are maybe disturbing issues - they are -  but they are real and you
have a Government about to inflict more damage on Iraq (the people of Iraq
not Saddam Hussein are my concern there) and possibly into Indonesia , the
Phillipines, and Korea - thank God Korea HAS got nukes or it would be
doomed: I want Korea to hurry up and get armed with ICBMs to match the US
and thus help defend itself and China against the US and India etc

Even if it is NOT the CIA who engineered S11 and the various other attacks
since (which I am pretty convinced they have done as it fits in with the
general pattern of how they operate and Bush's "axis of evil" nonsense) the
method of solving problems by bombing and attacking other countries
militarily is stupid and barbaric: in fact it can be seen that eg when you
have a sniper you cant stop who is a (probably a Christian - NOT A MUSLIM
fanatic - who has said he is God: he might even belong to the same (or a
similar) Church as Billy Graham)  it is clearly obvious that you can never
stop terrorism - and that war and violence by or in the US (where there is
crazed gun culture) generates terorrism: if the US was run by intelligent
peole such as Hilton and others on this list there would be a pulling back
and a big movement for peace and negotiations and assistance to and with all
countries in all cases (short of flotillas racing toward the US)...but the
truth is that no one has probably ever thought of attacking the US (in the
way Bush presumably imagines) and if they did you couldnt stop them:
meanwhile there is no conventional situation that approximates eg Pearl
harbour or Hitler's attack on England and so on.

So by ducking thses hard issues (I'm not expecting any agreement only
discussion) and hiding inside your poetry (unlike Baraka) you show that you
and others are being cowed by the CIA and the media (controlled by the
Aussie Rupert "GOTCHA!" Murdoch and other right wingers)...the US is almost
creating the attack on itself that it fears .. as you or your poem/persona
whatever seems to fear. But I'm not dodging the implicatiosn (NOT any
ant-semitism) my original email about Baraka: I stand by the "guts" of  that
email... but I dont think though that, to date, anyone outside the US has
attacked any US installation (except the right winger Timothy McVeigh who
was trained in guns etc by the US Army) (and there is a certain  - albeit
fascist - logic about what he did: HE saw it as a response an unjust attack
on his and other patriotic Americans).  Now I can believe people  - not
quite as crazy as McVeigh,but white Christian patriotic and racist Americans
could well be  your terrorists (or the most dangerous warmogers, whatever):
that's a possibility. There are a lot of those who are very rich and can
obtain military and electronic hardware.

Now: this is a response to your poem. The answer to "perpetual anxiety" is
consideration of the many possiblities (discussion after thought) then  some
action of some kind.

Of course you can "opt out " (dont worry I keep wanting to do just that
myself I know my weaknesses ("know thyself" was some Greek's saying I dont
know which) and often my own absurdities) but for me it boils down to this I
dont want to see one more person hurt anywhere: I want to see negotiations
and reason: not a war. This might be "idealistic" but I have to say these
things as a human bieng and as a father and a grandfather.I DONT hate any
Jews or Arabs or Americans or anyone anywhere: what is the point of that??
My bitterness grows from love.  THAT, not hate, is the only thing that can
help us..real love, even that of  The Christ (although I am not a Christian,
but I mean that aspect of Christianity: which surely says "thou shalt not
kill" and "turn the other cheek" and "love thy neighbours").  Where is that
love?

I guess, for some, hipness consists in not getting with the program.
Because I recently got this very odd gift from a friend: _Pegasus
Descending: a Book of the Best Bad Verse_  (New York: Collier Books,
1971), edited by Keith Waldrop, X.J. Kennedy, and James Camp.

Surprised me too.

There's  also _Bulsh_, by X. J. Kennedy, published in 1970 by Burning
Deck, and _Christopher Montgomery sings Connecticut Elegy_, music by
Christopher Montgomery; words by James Camp, Charles Causley, X. J.
Kennedy, Keith Waldrop. A Burning Deck Record.

These from Forty Years of Burning Deck Press, 1961 - 2001

http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/exhibits/burningdeck/

which begins with this interesting quote (the next-to-last sentence is
esp. choice):

"In 1961, poets were supposed to be in opposing camps, often inelegantly
- and inaccurately - labeled 'academics' or 'beats'. The two most widely
noted anthologies of the time, both representing the period 1945-1960,
contain not a single poet in common.

Burning Deck (the magazine) disregarded this split, printing and
reviewing a spread of poets wide enough that on occasion an author would
complain of being published in such unprogrammatic company. Though
advertised as a 'quinterly', the magazine, after only four issues, gave
way to a series of pamphlets and - later - books of poetry and short
fiction. Our list remains eclectic, with some emphasis on experimental
writing and an attention to recent British poets generally ignored in
this country.

Since being eclectic is not always taken for a virtue, we would note
that our eclecticism - besides simply reflecting personal ranges of
appreciation - is based on an inability to believe that the history of,
for instance, poetry can possibly be clear before the poems are written.
It is not denying the importance of 'movements', to insist that there is
another importance in moving beside or apart from them. After all, there
are many judgements, none of them the last."

                           make haste and spring up to
eradicate expectation of their thrall's richest glow
lash                       last

the kind of face that goes pale when darkened by crowds

Taken by "line-to-next-line" units, there's
two types of writing here,
each giving an impression that
they may exist in a relation other than proximal.
Rather than several disparate bits given on the page,
there are two cuts of writing interacting with each other
in more than a visual context.
Is writing purely visual (read, if you like, "material")?
There is the matter of intent,
of the author's thoughts,
even if at the instance of composition the author
is mainly thinking of something other than writing.
So what then of the words -  the phrase as line and line as
constantly projecting unit - that exist outside the author's intent (though
it could easily be argued that all ready-made words exist  outside an
individual author's intent)?
Do the words arrange their own supra-visual context?
They give the impression of meaning in their proximity, it is true, but does
the fact that the words themselves have in the past been arranged into more
traditionally meaning-freighted sentences, even sentences that have changed
lives and altered world history,
lend supra-visual import?
I would claim that the lines are their own past, and the field
they occupy is not one of linguistics per se but of poetry -- something
visual more like a pre-manufactured "natural" phenomenon than a work of art.
It is poetry's business to be neither art nor nature, nor that which lies
between (i.e., Virginia).
Each unit leading into and forming the next is
a type of writing discrete from the next such unit.
Hence, there are always two types of writing in this poem.
It is the act of writing visible AND intellectual.
The intent in this poem arises from the thrust of the structure.

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 900 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A good number of other people read the Poetics List via our web
archives at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 10 below).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in
poetry that are committed to innovations, renovations, and
investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning of
received forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise
unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project, and respect our decision to
operate a moderated list. For subscription information or to
contact the moderators, write to <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

Please note that this is a private list and information about
this list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific rather than general interests, and also to keep the
scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.
The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day, and
two messages per subscriber per day.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the increasing
number of subscribers, we are no longer able to maintain the
open format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).
All submissions are reviewed by the moderators in keeping with
the goals of the list, as articulated in this Welcome Message.
The specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively
fluid one: in most cases, messages are reviewed after having
been posted to the list, and difficulties resolved on that basis;
however, the list moderators may shift with impunity between
this and a pre-review mode which calls for all messages to
be read and approved before being forwarded to the list. We
prefer to avoid this option, as it hampers the spontaneity of
discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to these
options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under
individual review, in which case only their messages would
be received for moderators' approval before being forwarded
to the list. For further information, please see number 4, the
Cautions section of this Welcome Message. We remain
committed to this editorial function as a defining element of
the Poetics List.

Those few individuals who are no longer welcome to post on this
list have forfeited that right because of their refusal to abide
by list policies as stated in this Welcome message. While we
adhere to a practice of not discussing particular cases on the
list, the areas of our greatest concern include flaming of other
list subscribers, including the list owners, and/or giving us
false registration information. Please note some individuals
have publicized false accounts of the policies of the Poetics
List. We have deemed it unwise to respond directly to the flames
of the list, preferring simply to note here that the Poetics List
exists to support and encourage divergent points of view on Modern
and contemporary poetry and poetics. We are committed to do what
is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog, as well as
announcements of events important to our subscribers. For this
reason, the list has always been private or moderated: so that
we can do the best job possible to ensure the editorial project
that underlies our efforts.

For further information on posting to the list, see sections 3 and 4.
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 8.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 8
for details.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators
at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all
of the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
to resubscribe. If you find that it is not possible to unsub using your
old address, please contact the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a good number of Poetics messages are
bounced from your account, your subscription to Poetics will be
temporarily suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe
to the list by contacting the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to one week or more for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by
the moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated
in this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics
and political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also
welcome. Feel free to query the list moderators if you are
uncertain as to whether a message is appropriate. All
correspondence with the moderators regarding submissions to
the list remains confidential and should be directed to us at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on
publications and reading series that they have coordinated, edited,
published, or in which they appear. Such announcements
constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address:

     <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 4 below.
Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 9.

-------------------

4. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees or the list owners, also messages designed to
"waste bandwidth" or cause the list to reach its daily limit.
These messages are considered offensive and detrimental to
list discussion. Offending subscribers will be placed on
temporary review (see section 1). Repeat offenders will be
removed from the list immediately. Please do not put this
policy to test!

'Caveat lector': The Poetics List has become increasingly, though
in small proportion, occupied by subscribers who interest themselves
in pseudonymous authorship. The practice, while not encouraged by
the moderators, is tolerated on the grounds that it is no more
practicably eradicable than effectually harmful - not harmful,
that is, until it becomes so on the level of particular, individual
interactions. The feeling, for subscribers unaware of the circumstance,
may be - and perhaps justifiably so - one of having been 'duped.'
That said, we have felt it necessary to caution subscribers to
read carefully and be sure of your acquaintance as it suits your
personal comfort.

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

For reasons of basic security, we actively discourage the
sending of HTML-formatted messages to the list. A quick
glance at the list archive and at list digests (see sections 5
and 9) will show that HTML-formatted messages are not
interpreted by the listserv program as it is currently
configured, which makes their reading inconvenient at
best. All messages intended for the Poetics List should
be sent in ASCII or Text-Only format.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post, since this may make it
difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.
Messages containing attachments will be presumed to be
worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission
of the author! Posting on the list is a form of publication.
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without
the author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair
use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages
per day from any one subscriber; in general, we expect subscribers
to keep their post to less than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is
a manageable list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers)
of 50 or fewer messages per day.

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

5. Subscription Options

It is possible to receive the Poetics List as separate posts
or as daily digests. When you subscribe, the default setting is
"regular," meaning you will receive a separate email for each
message distributed to the list.

Regular:
The default option, this is the form in which you will receive
the list if you choose no other. With a "regular" subscription,
you receive individual postings immediately, as they are OK'd
by the list moderator. To revert to this option if you are
currently receiving the list in digest form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain the following text:

     set poetics nodigest

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

Digest:
With a "digest" subscription, you receive larger messages (called
"digests") at regular intervals, usually once per day. These "digests"
are collections of individual list postings. Some lists are so active
that they produce several digests daily; the Poetics List produces
only one, mailed just after midnight EST.

Digests are a good compromise between reading everything as it is
posted and feeling like the list is clogging your mailbox with a
multitude of individual postings.

To receive the Poetics List in digest form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain the following text:

     set poetics digest

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

Index:
With an "index" subscription, you receive a short "index" message
once per day. These "indexes" show you what is being discussed on
the list without including the text of the individual postings. For
each posting, the date, the author's name and address, the subject
of the message and the number of lines it comprises is listed. You
can then follow instructions provided in the index to download
messages of interest from the server.

An index subscription is ideal if you have a slow connection and
only read a few hand-picked messages. The indexes are very short
and you do not have to worry about long download times. The drawback
of course is that you need to maintain your internet connection or
reconnect to order messages of interest from the server.

You can choose to have the index sent to you in either a traditional
format (plain text) or in HTML format with hyperlinks. Using the HTML
index, you may click on a link provided with each message to open your
web browser to that message in the Poetics List archive.

To receive the Poetics List in index form, send a one-line
message with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

The body of the message should contain, for the text-only
index:

     set poetics nohtml index

And for the hyper-link index:

     set poetics html index

Your subscription options will be updated automatically.

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Please do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

     set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 9 below.)

-------------------

7. "Review Subscribership" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review subscribers"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information. Address queries are, of course, welcome
to be posted to the list.

-------------------

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

The EPC's mission is to serve as a gateway to the extraordinary
range of activity in formally innovative writing and digital media
poetry in the United States and around the world. The Center provides
access to extensive resources in new poetries. These include our
E-POETRY library, our links to digital VIDEO and SOUND (including
our award-winning LINEbreak series of radio interviews and performances)
as well as e-journals such as lume, Deluxe Rubber Chicken, Alyricmailer,
and many others, the POETICS List archives, an AUTHOR library of
electronic poetry texts and bibliographies, and direct connections
to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides
information about contemporary electronic poetry magazines and print
little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics.
Visit the EPC's many libraries, the featured resources available on
the EPC home page, or its NEW listings, where recent additions are
available for quick access.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

-------------------

9. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://epc.buffalo.edu>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to
<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html>.

You may browse the Poetics List archives by month and year or
search them for specific information. Your interface will allow
you to print or download any of these files.

Please note that it is possible to toggle between proportional
and non-proportional fonts in viewing archived messages; a
feature that may be useful to interpret messages reliant on
the neat spacing of a proportional font, or that require the
"word wrap" feature of same - and useful, too, for aesthetic
reasons. To change the display font of an archived message,
simply follow the "proportional font" or "non-proportional font"
link at the top of the message.

The following is a breakdown of Poetics List subscribers by country.
Please note the relative inaccuracy built into the system: non-U.S.
email addresses that do not end in a country code (e.g., ".ca" for
Canada) are grouped by the Listserv program with U.S. addresses.
It's a glitch that's never far out of step with U.S. foreign policy,

     "The Greek word, _Poesis, derived from _poien (to make), conveys two
kinds of creation: the inspired creation that resembles a godlike power and
the difficult material struggle, the _techne of making forms out of the
resources available.  Poetry's work of creating the figure of the human
proceeds by means of imagination and a material engagement with the
resources of language." = Stewart, Susan, _Poetry and the Fate of the
Senses, Univ. of Chicago, 2002. -><

     "Poetry can only stake out its proper place for itself - resisting
today's media-saturated world - by creating unconforming forms that
ceaselessly raise the question of how meaning is articulated in language."

perhaps we are about to find our way back through the strange detour through

(note: in this new series this is what i did - i converted the binary code
of different graphic formats into ascii text - this piece is an excerpt from
a rgb image - then for the cover artwork of each volume i used screenshot
software with a timer to capture the text from the atmosphere series of
teddy warburg's voice of the village (www.voice-of-the-village.com) - and as
the timer captured screenshots of the text i kept the scrollbar depressed -
this approach was influenced by my phone conversations with the semiotic
theoretician professor paul bouissac, the new media artist lanny quarles,
and the multimedialist and critic lewis lacook)

Alan. I'm responding now to the "writer Alan" or he so-called "persona" and
I have to say that this is good hard hitting stuff, (maybe not the most
subtle terminology I admit) as they say. And I like the double or multiple
immplications here...of course "you" dont want to be "involved" into
something that disturbs and eg I dont want to hear (currently) anything
about the recent bombing in Indonesia for a while...but of course we all
stay involved from different distances and "angels" of looking at or from
the world, and this is a way of you or the "writer you" being inside your
text and also speaking out of it I am affected strongly by this....I know
that you are incoroporating this into a larger project but the effect of
this one on myself ...it _feels_ like its directed to me (that is maybe the
way a lot of people may respond to it -feeling it is directed to them (eg I
see the "israel you're ignorant", well the "you're ignorant" leaps out (and
about Israel/the world maybe I am in certain ways but of course reading more
carefully that also says (with other things)  (or implies) another "speaker"
talking to 'us', or the Alan in there, "you Israelis, you American
pro-Israelis or Jewish people are ignorant - of course that's only a
fraction of what can be "read into'it...) or similar things you do)..and not
many of us have been "on the wrong end of a gun"...and true..its
"impossible" to know so I take this as being as "commtited"  and as
psychologically or existentially and even as politically intense (in fact in
some
ways it is more so) than Baraka's harrangue (which I still think was a good
thing as I see it as a kind of challenge to the right wing: and/but  you see
it
maybe as a diatribe). This "response" of yours, is, well its intense.

This is where the talk of "readerly" and "writerely" has application: in
fact I think that this is the kind of thing I was thinking of as a "bridge"
between the best of the confessionals and language poetry etc it enriches he
totality of the skein of what you are creating.

Jabes "Book of Questions" of found good but too remote for me but this kind
of thing strikes home: and the method (common but still strong) of
interlacing links into a poem in your other post is also effective: there is
no doubt of the originality nad the meaningfulness and sometimes the courage
of the "Alan (persona?) in the text Alan"..and in these ones the "real" Alan
is surely not far under the surface.

There is in fact an extaordinary intensity gained by the inverted syntax and
the sentence level "chopping" and the end is acusatory and sounds hurting: I
read this  more than a lot of other things  you have done. To the poem () I
say: you disturbed me very much () and that is a sign and i dont do () know
i am dust what () do i know i'm never in been there i , i, i,  i have been
hurt,() () 00 () () hurthurt, ou you you, we we we,and in there () and the

Poet laureate quits over fudged resume
Creative writing professor admits lying about degree
Kelly St. John, Chronicle Staff Writer
Sunday, October 20, 2002
C2002 San Francisco Chronicle.

URL:
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/10/20/BA186979.DTL



California's first official poet laureate, Quincy Troupe, has resigned
after acknowledging he lied on his resume about graduating from college.


And the admission could even cost him his tenured position as a creative
writing and literature professor at the University of California at San
Diego.

Troupe, 62, submitted a letter of resignation to Gov. Gray Davis late
Friday night. He had held the poet laureate post for four months.

"I deeply regret my ill-advised decision to include inaccurate
information on my curriculum vitae," Troupe said in a statement released
by the governor's office. "While I attended Grambling College, I never
earned a college degree."

The discrepancy was discovered in a background check by the state Senate
Rules Committee, which had been preparing for his confirmation hearing,
said Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean.

Davis appointed Troupe to the post on June 11. The job, which requires a
minimum of six poetry readings during a two-year term, is not salaried
but includes a $10,000 yearly honorarium.

"Mr. Troupe is a great poet, and he's a great person. He brought a lot
of excitement to the idea of poetry in our lives," McLean said Saturday.
"This doesn't take anything away from his accomplishments."

Troupe, a St. Louis native who lives in La Jolla, called his tenure as
poet laureate "one of the high points" of his career.

"I am honored and privileged to have served in that position, albeit for
a short time," he said in his statement. "I now look forward to turning
my full attention to continuing to teach and develop students at UCSD,
to developing literary and music programs in the San Diego community,
and to writing books."

But the revelations could jeopardize Troupe's post at UCSD, where he has
taught since 1991.

Troupe formally told the university Thursday that he had not graduated
from Grambling, said Jim Langley, vice chancellor for external affairs.
His situation constitutes a violation of the faculty code of conduct,
and Troupe faces a formal review.

Punishment could range from a reprimand to a recommendation for
dismissal, Langley said. The university, which is still investigating
similar precedents of tenured professors who do not have bachelor's
degrees, will complete its review in six weeks, he said.

"This is a senior, tenured professor and very accomplished, so obviously
this is a difficult case," Langley said.

Troupe joins a growing list of public figures who have been discovered
to have taken poetic license with their resumes. U.S. Olympic Committee
head Sandra Baldwin and Notre Dame football coach George O'Leary both
resigned after it was learned they fudged their academic credentials.

McLean said the California Arts Council, which chose Troupe for the post
after considering more than 50 candidates, will determine how to replace
him.

Two Northern California poets -- Francisco X. Alarcon, 48, of Davis and
Diane DiPrima, 67, of San Francisco -- had been the other finalists for
the post.

DiPrima was out of town Saturday at a Detroit poetry reading. Her
partner, Sheppard Powell, said she had not been contacted by the
governor's office. Alarcon could not be reached Saturday.

Troupe has been praised for promoting literacy within the schools. His
13th book, "take it to the hoop, Magic Johnson" is based on his "poem
for Magic" and was published as a children's book.

Troupe edited "James Baldwin: The Legacy" and co-authored an
autobiography of jazz musician Miles Davis. He has also won two American
Book Awards for poetry and nonfiction, and a Peabody Award for
co-producing a radio show about Miles Davis.

Troupe is not the only state poet laureate to attract unwanted
attention. New Jersey's poet laureate, Amiri Baraka, has been strongly
criticized for writing allegedly anti-Semitic verse. Despite a call by
New Jersey Gov. James McGreevey for his resignation, Baraka has refused
to step down.

As some of you know, I lead a poetry workshop every other month (alternate
months the workshop is led by Narney Lattimore-- we work indeoendently and
don't even know what the other ios doing much of the time, but he does more
close readings of famous poems while I do more reading of contemporary and
avant garde poems and writing exercises and games  (a la surrealist game, if
you know what that's about, it's a kind of game for poets, not for
children!) in class) at NAMI NYC-Metro (which has as little to do with my
workshop as posssible although now they brag about having it...).

This Wednesday, Oct 23rd, I have invited a publiushed and anthologized poet
Brenda Coultas (in New American Poets, ed, Jarnot, et al and Heights of the
Hudson, edited by Todd Colby, for example) to come help woth the workshop.
She will listen to our poems, read her own work, and talk about and answer
questions on getting published, making it as a full-time poet, etc.  It
should be a lot of fun.

She is not a consumer, as far as I know. However she knows this is for a
consumer audience amd says she teaches non traditional students at her
teaching job, and was very clued whne we exchanged mail about what the group
was like.

I hope that some of you can come!

In any case I welcome you to come any other month for the workshop as well.
I will be doing next months workshop.  It meets at 732 Park Ave South, Suite
710 (between 29th and 30th) which is the National Alliance for the Mentally
Ill of New York City Metro.  Meeting date is the fourt Wendesday of the
month, and the time is 6:30 although I have a tendency to be late (there
will be someone there who will organize peple reading their poems to the
group before I arrive.  I usually have a schedule of exercises and readings
planned, and we read each other the poems we write in class but I don't do
much open reading of poems, because I want this to be a workshop where
people can come who want to write poetry but have not yet written any they
want to share, and reading student poems favors those who come in with them.
But I will read and comment on any poem you bring in after the workshop or
between workshops and give it a careful read and thoughtful response.  I do
plan to have a spoecial meeting/party where we can all read our poems, some
time this winter probably right before Christmas.

The meetings are open to anyone who has a mental illness or for some reason
feels that their experience puts them in a position of solidarity (equality)
with people who have mental illness (for example someone came who was not
officially ill but quite chronically upset from childhood abuse; someone
else might be extremely stressed to the point of feeling alientated from
peers, even if it is from a reality based source like grad school or work;
another person might be in poverty and share our dependence on the
government and the lack of opportunities we have for self-improvement).
This does not include most parents of the mentally ill, who in general do
not see themselves as equal to the person with the illness.

Obviously you should have an interest in reading and writing poetry, but
prior education and experience is not necessary.  The workshop does not
asume the you remember even high school literature; it does however teach
adult, college-level concepts and poems, without pressure and homework and
allowing students to absorb material at their own rate.  With these
accomodations I believe that mentally ill folk can attain the same level of
competence as non-ill people.  For example we studied and wrote villanelles,
we read and discussed "difficult" contemporary poets like Clark Coolidge and
James Tate, and we had a debate about a passage in Homer's Odyssey.  These
are advanced topics.  But it was done in the spirit of fun, with many
breaks, down to earth explanations, game-like writing exercises in-between
difficult sections, and a very small group.

Hope to see you Wednesday with Brenda Coultas or at a subsequent workshop!

Millie

Dear Arielle,

Please send me a one-paragraph bio, and a few sentences about your
proposed reading (as an email attachment).
I'm hoping to make a proposal for several readings this week.  Also,
your preferred dates: I think early December or late February would be
good.

Here's Charles Olson on the subject of Diane DiPrima in 1962 from that
PDF file of his talk at Goddard College in Vermont that Louis Cabri et
al just posted to the Slought website:


"The next poem has just recently been-appeared in New York, in-I'm
trying to think where it did appear? Oh yes, in LeRoi Jones' Floating
Bear if you know this remarkable, mimeographed magazine, which is
appearing in our time. Do you know? Do any of you know this great
editor? The greatest editor since Robert Creeley, and Jones has been
putting this thing out for a couple of-oh no, maybe it's not been a
year, with Diane Di Prima. She does the typing most remarkably.
[Coughing in audience] No, I say, say that, very odd, don't think I'm
putting her down, wow, I mean, I published the most terrible thing that
was ever written last year called, "A Grammar-A Book." And it's nothing
but parts of speech; and she took my typed copy and put it in mimeograph
so there wasn't a-and it's all tilted, and squeezed and shoved, and the
only trouble is that the mimeograph doesn't make sense; actually it's
the typewriter that can't make the same effect as a typewriter, but
that's not her fault, she did it marvelously, it was like the greatest
publishing I ever had, was like Miss Di Prima."

Art or Action - Joy Garnett's Bomb Project


To say that Joy Garnett's Bomb Project is monumental would be an understatement. To say that it's a necessary reminder of the power unleashed at the end of World War II, and of the power the whole world cringed under during the Cold War--that would be more like it. And yet there's more going on here than activism (as if that weren't enough). ..

Stand by Your Logo


Beneath the cap of the Enemy,
                flirting with Freckled Danger

     we're umbrellas, not people, pretending
     to Be Animals, imagining showers

in Disregard of the fabulous advice
                of Street psychics

      We forgive lovers and Ask for
                       more more
                                more

Elsewhere beneath Panting and
                trips to the Head

Panels are being Created

To fill the vast Need

for Round About answers
     At a time like Now

And in deserted amusement parks
        clowns are plotting their next
                   squeaky moves

It is Especially disquieting tonite
           to see all of you

                   calmly melting
Beneath these ever-hostile pines

Back to safety and the dance
           a fiercely competitive
           rumba that will

Definitely leave us all Behind

Beneath 8-balls and wet rocks

Light is being scurried from

And fevers forgotten for Good

"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."
--Benjamin Franklin

There have been more than a few "poets" I know who seem to have nothing rational or sensible to say about the Baraka situation.  The fascist-speak of censorship is NOT something I'm used to hearing from "poets."  But maybe I just need to get used to it?  Yeah well, I think NOT!

Recently I was fortunate enough to hear Bob Holman read his poems in Philadelphia.  Earlier that morning he had held a press conference at the Bowery Poetry Club for Baraka to have his say.  Holman read his introduction for Baraka for us in Philadelphia, and I asked his permission to share it with the Buffalo List.

Introductory Statement to Amiri Baraka Press Conference
Thursday, October 17, 2002  11AM
Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, NY  NY  10012
212-614-1224  www.bowerypoetry.com


Welcome, Press.  I'm Bob Holman, the Proprietor of the Bowery Poetry Club.  Since we are a poetry club I thought I'd start with some lines by another Jersey poet, William Carlos Williams:

          It is difficult
  to get the news from poems
          yet men die miserably every day
                                 for lack
  of what is found there.

The Bowery Poetry Club exists to be a vector, an energy connector, between the poem and the public.  We do this through performances, readings, a bookstore, the utilization of all technologies to present the poem itself.  This morning we add "press conference" as another means to communicate to the world at large, and we welcome our sister and brother writers, journalists, to our holy spot.  We urge you to consider this locus should you wish to find another voice on current events:  the voice of the poet, which doesn't often break into the evening news.

We believe the First Amendment to be a Poetic License -- to write a poem is to send a space shot into consciousness.  Once the poem has landed, its job is to provoke thought, wonderment, dialogue.  Amiri Baraka is going to have a four-day run here at the Club (Oct 31-Nov 3).  Each evening will begin with a Poets Speakout:  poets responding to "Somebody Blew Up America" and the resulting brouhaha.

We are totally committed to the right of poets to write the poetry they wish.  A poem is Democracy's calling card.

Now I present to you the poet who has been called the Father of Contemporary African American Literature, still the Poet laureate of New Jersey, Amiri Baraka.

"America speaks with one voice." -- George W. Bush

Another reminder to all that this Saturday, Oct 26, is a National Day of
Protest against the Bush administration's proposed war with Iraq.

There will be a march on Washington, there is a rally in San Francisco. But
as most of us cannot be in DC or SF, we are encouraging protests that range
from sign-posting (on your office door, your car, in your yard or window)
to sign-carrying, from letters to your local papers and representatives to
the picketing of local tv stations and newspapers. Remember, the media have
not been covering the protests satisfactorily: we should take our message
to the media too. The following url indexes local action groups around the
nation. Check it and see if anything's being organized for your area:

http://www.legitgov.org/

Also, you can download and print flyers for the protest here:

It seems to me the only reason it mattered who was in that book was because
the book mattered.
There have been tons of anthologies that have excluded me and I can't
understand that at all!

"the bond of proportion is the spirit of friendship"

That’s what a Post-It of mine says on a page of Plato’s Timaeus....

Olson’s 1962 reading at Goddard College worries over, and continually
circles back to, in asides, the discomfort if not the outright inadequacy he
feels about transcription, notation or recording of his voice, on its own
terms, in relation to his poetry, and of his poetry. "I have this problem
with scoring" (13) he says, which causes him at various times in the reading
to repeat what he reads. He's a "captive poet" (5) of the event of reading.
The problem is, he's not a performer; he's a composer -- "I'm Beethoven!"
(13) (what an analogy: Beethoven went deaf and yet continued composing,
undaunted...).

The big issue with transcribing some NAP poets is how much "breath" does one
acknowledge in print? At some point it would seem that for the transcriber
the ideality of the sentence and of grammar generally intervene to make
figures for you, out of a sometimes aurally abstract canvas. In the case of
the transcribed excerpt that Ron Silliman cites, the way I hear one crucial
line in particular seems to differ from how Kyle Schlesinger hears and
transcribes it, which led me to write the following.

Kyle hears "She does the typing most remarkably. [Coughing in audience]"
which suggests Olson is unbearably patronizing and seems to clinch the issue
of women in NAP. I hear the ungrammatical "She does the typing, most
remarkable." That changes the tone somewhat -- granted, only ever so
slightly alters the ultimate patronizing conclusion. This still remains a
clinching passage. But, this difference of two letters in one word does
invite a subtle reading, which for me opens the libidinal flow of this
passage to quite a lot of information about Olson's poetics. For then Olson
pauses, and it's almost a theatrical pause, which invites not just
[coughing] but what I'd call [nervous laughter] from the audience to be
heard as just that, as expressing nervousness (which I take to be about how
Olson just put-down Di Prima). Once Olson has elicited that response from
his audience, he responds in turn with a quasi-drunken slur of protest
("don't think I'm putting her down, wow" etc). There's a lot of staging
going on here.

But Olson is not completely in control of the verbal stagecraft.
"Remarkable" (not "remarkably") links back to how he just described Floating
Bear -- as this "remarkable" magazine. So there *is* a link to Di Prima as
co-editor as well, but this link is suppressed to a submerged level of
repetition -- of a word, the adjective "remarkable." Then, a revealing
syntactic parallelism occurs by defining Jones as "the greatest editor since
Robert Creeley," while Di Prima is a personal experience, "the greatest
publishing I [or "I've"] ever had," which seems to unconsciously mimic the
speech patterning of a generic, sexualized phrase ('the greatest lay I ever
had'? etc). Di Prima becomes one with the matter of the magazine itself.

There is a tension in the passage Ron cites between "parts of speech," its
subject (the subject of "A Book -- A Grammar"), and Di Prima's typesetting
of Olson's text for Floating Bear that attempts (but fails, according to
Olson) to "imitate" Olson's parts of speech in their variety of forms
(whether as poetry, or as in this case, diagram of discourse, etc).

Olson begins his 1962 reading with a distinction between kinds of reading,
one he dismisses as "performance," that the tape recorder exacerbates, and
another which he does not quite identify before moving to other subjects.
(However the subject of performance recurs at various points in the reading,
in various ways.) The distinction would seem to be or become Robert
Duncan's, actually, who clearly delineates a historical difference between
poetry as "performance" and as "office" the next year (see Duncan’s audio
stream of his Vancouver 1963 lecture at
http://slought.net/toc/archives/display.php?id=1094). The role of poet as
one of holding, in a civic metaphor (secular, for Olson), an "office,"
figures into the next poem that Olson reads, too, "In the Face of a Chinese
View of the City." The office of poet is moral, above business and "liberal"
social life, and male gendered.

Di Prima is identified with the matter of type, and with the problem of
transcribing Olson's voice and poetry. The cliché Olson leans on here is
gendering the printed word as female. I think you could trace this back to
how "receptacle" is used in like manner by Plato in The Timaeus (see John
Sallis's recent book on this dialogue and issue) -- the point and concept
that Luce Irigaray raises in her critique of this Western conceptual legacy
as it constitutes the "spirit of friendship" (in this case, among poets).

Or, a little more accurately perhaps:

I hear "She does the typing ... most remarkable. [nervous laughter]" Nervous
laughter because the audience remains unsure of how to hear the last two
words. Does "most remarkable" refer to the fact that Di Prima can type
(sexist put-down, moreover, of the very work women stereotypically were
enabled to do), or does it reiterate Olson's high opinion of the magazine
(indirectly complementing Di Prima for her co-editing role with the
"remarkable" Jones)? It's staged. It's both. The one, Olson denies (it's a
feint). The other, he elaborates further. Di Prima is a perfectionist
typesetter. It’s not her fault that he is conflicted over "scoring."

my response to Allan's poems came from my own conscience as i hate hurting
people and got a feeling of deep disturbance inside allan's poem(s) which
interestingly ties up with a book  i'm reading by another Alan, Alan
Loney -who is not Jewish and is not writing about the holocaust or
anything -
in fact his lastest prose-poetry book which is called "The Falling" (title
as it happens of a book by William Golding who also wrote Pincher Martin in
which the whole book concerns itself with the moment or process of death and
so on: so there is a connection for PhD students of the future...)(but at
this point I can say that Allan's book is the work of an extraordinarily
highly talented worker: it is as they say a real "tour de force", fantastic,
one of the best works of lit I have seen ...it reminds me somewhaht of the
power of Faulkner in "The Sound and the Fury" or "As I Lay Dying"...) works
on many levels including that of his own personal experience or memories of
the death of a shool boy friend of his with Robert Hale who died in the
Tangiwai (tears-river) river disastor in 1953 (in New Zealand (Aotearoa) of
course)  and which was caused by  the force of a lahar (or a kind of
mud-snow slide) from Mount Ruapehu and which acted like a huge buldozer and
wiped out a bridge as a train was crossing (not that there is any clear
connection to this event or the holocaust or isreael or the other alan)
....but it works or operates both if
you like at the linguistic and the poetic-emotive and the level of
contemplation-intellection (which in fact is also the level of many of the
best of, or of, those kind of language poems (such as some of Suasan Howe's
say or even ...there are hundreds of the poets ...but moving back in time
maybe  similar experiential thing is in John Berryman's sonnets, or more
recently John Weiners, or the bitterness of Ed Dorn, or the "inner"
prose-poetry-esssay-meditations-play  of Nick Piombino...there are so many))
or indeed of Alan's Sondheim's
(where the very massiveness of his project I have felt indicates  a torment
(in the best sense for me) ) (and has an effect in its own right- if right
is the right word...some weak puns there..)
now torment probably has roots to (it has roots to a "missile engine" and
also to torquere= to twist..).......so the generative force, creative,
twists us
and turns us somewhat into missile throwers, or missile generators of
missives (emails) and I know that a  lot of my own work was "generated" by
the anguish of a relationship that disintegrated and the near tragedy
involving my own son who was battened here by the police and then lost an
eye but there was "other shit going down" as they say)(in  its own way it
was tragic to the degree that things that us personally very strongly
affective to numero uno are tragedies) and maybe the "tragedy" of my own
misfunction in certain social areas and the "tragedy" of my laziness etc
(this is not to say that my life in this country, in the war sense  a very
peaceful country and free of pogroms and so on, has not been marvellous and
it is beautiful place by and large and i have had a lot of opportunities and
happiness here: have been fortunate...) ..but these emotive "gernerators"
interract with the "technical language" and so on which act like conductors
or structures: as the poem-project has to be much more than a political
harrangue or "rave" or in sub specie aeternitatis it becomes a weak,
insignificant thing, a trifle, but there are many ways to skin the poetic
cat.

I dont think any of us should let these (ultimately external events) drive
us apart: eg I might think (as a random example to tke for argument's sake
as they say)that North Korea is ok while someone else lies awake all night
worrying about it - but that issue neither of us is directly responsible for
and it shouldnt be a cause of  total personal dislike or division: but
ultimately, in all probably, no terrible holocausts will happen anymore: we
are probably at this moment in history, ironically it seems, at a higher
level of humanity and peacefulness than has been for a long time (not at we
should relax our "eternal vigilance") (if we go back and look even at London
in the 1870s the people on the "lower" social stratas lived in what some
writers compared to an inferno) and despite the various wars such asVietnam
on the casualties overall are less than that of WW1 and WW2 and we have the
potential to organise now through the United nations a much better world
where eg India and the United States and NZ and all other countries can
eventually enjoy quite high standards of living in some kind of unified
world (one day): note I didnt say or mention any Utopian vision (per se) at
this stage...I cannot myself hate anyone for very long (of course I'm not
partial to certain "monstrous" people we all read about) but by and large
despite everything, people are mainly decent still......Muslim or Christian
or other "fanatacisms" or Capitalism or distorted and enforced Communism or
other "isms" etc may be "evils" but this doesnt mean we all fall on each
other with knives or collapse in a panic of fear and mistrust, or I dont
talk to Allan or Harry Nudel or Nick because we both said silly things, or I
went "over the top": the answer I think is for us all  (myself  included) to
learn tolerance and methods of dialogue (which is one of he good signals or
concepts that Language Poetry is sending or attempts to send out)...and I am
not so wonderful a person in these matters I have my irrational moments and
my fears and confusions: I am poet, or would like to think I am, not a
politician and find "politics": can  trap one into a kind of rhetorical
(almost a hypnotic state) (one thinks of Yeat's poems centred upon or
backgrounded by the Irish conflicts and the First World War) and a spiral of
attack and counter attack that does no one any good: some people are very
for good at dialogue and at being considerate of others this, my not being
tooo good at such,  is my own difficulty: it is worth me noting this to
remind myself (not "beat up" on myself, as I intend to act upon  it) and
that others also are similar: at base we all bleed as in the Merchant of
Venice and "(mercy) droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven" and I feel that
Baraka is motivated by his sense of the injustices of the world 9apparently
he was much  affected by the killing of Malcolm X) and Alan and others feel
them but deal with them in different ways (and also of course injustice and
"tragedy" etc surely are hopefully not the only motivators of poets or God
help us...)...these are my own unmediated thoughts (well, as unmediated or
as "innocent " as my devious "inner self" and the language will allow)....

Alan asked me to pass this on: I think it is imprtant that if we wish to
communicate anything at all we should be allowed to and should not feel that
it it is trivial or naive: granted I myself have some things I dont want to
"know about": but here is  Alan:

I can understand the force of this it was something I have been thinking
about a lot.  I had the book about the ship that was doomed and I think the
Jews had to return to Europe...in truth "i dont know" as I have t travelled

I separate the right wing Zionists from those Jews and Arabs who want to set

It is terrible stuff: and even people relatively "uninvolved" such as myself
feel the awfulness of it apart from the sophistry and complexity and so on
of the politics.

I can accept that his sense of outrage may have lead him into excessive
hyperbole: this is the danger of political rhetoric that Nick is (rightly)
wary of...and I've been 'trapped' into (or trapped myself into) it at
various times.....

They may or may not. The trouble is: we just cant know what people are
thinking. If Bush is right the situation is as terrible as if Bush etal are
alies in some made world-wide conspiracy to generate a "war for oil" (why
have a war for oil?).  But there a lot of good people around Alan, more than
bad,  who dont irrationally hate other people of any colour or race: there
are the people we need totalk to and gather around us so to speak (Yeats
speaks of the deliberate isolation of the poet and I can understand that
too)....I think you should talk to Baraka (by letter or phone or email) your
feelings on these matters...

> Apologies for the naivete here -

Dont: keep working (as if I could influence you!)...I wish I had ever
visited Israel maybe my views would be more 'rational' or more complex: and
that is also why i was tring to find if my grandfather was Jewish only to
see if that would influence my thinking (my Uncle said he was of Jewish
descent...my sister for some reason wanted him to be of Scotch
descent!!!...but my brother eg looks very much like a "middle eastern" or
semitic type...so the question of origions.....naivete I like just as i
(really) like eg "gnomic" stuff by eg barrett watten etc as well:   I like
the mix so to speak........

Pull the lever?  Fancy me, oh thou.
Can’t look away—belief is negotiable
Through (drip drip) sophistry (nitpick),

Of the tidepool trips toward: ocean, sandy.

They’re both, you know, from Oklahoma.
John looks like a kindly gnome when he laughs.
Something is missing, but we

The next YARD...

October. While it is true that our fantastic line-up of readers could
warm the heart of any snow beast north of Alaska and probably our little
circle of listners as well, and because these days end around six o'clock in
the evening and we can never really say whether it will snow or be a balmy
eleven degrees celsius, our little YARD reading series will have to move in
doors. And what better place to be than in the warmth and comfort of the
beloved Auburn Saloon?

This month we are offered a veritable feast of sensations and sounds
that will leave us wondering what sorts of situations lurk around each
dark corner as LOUIS CABRI gathers the invisible forces that power our
social machine to give them sonorous substance before our very ears.

And as the moon slips more and more out of the earth's shadow what
better way to enjoy the foggy nights and crystal clear animal sounds of
Calgary than with a trip through the abattoirs of the imagination with ANDRE
RODRIGUES?

We can all be certain that the beauty of listening to LARISSA LAI
read is the realization that though we are awake and attentive we are in
fact enjoying a fascinatingly somatic, dreamlike experience all the more
poignant for its hypnotic effect.  An autumnal gift.

There are black cats and bats, witches and goblins, and all manner of
dark arts abounding as we approach the 31st but with JILL HARTMAN on our
side the night should transpire with her words forming a protective barrier
around the Auburn and environs that also has an spf rating of 45.  After the
26th though we're on our own.

A short open mic will follow the featured readers.  The rules are
simple and based on the lexiconjury rules:  one poem and one cover poem of
your choosing.  Please note, you MUST have a cover poem in order to read at
the open mic.

I'd like to wish the lexiconjury reading series continued success on
the occasion of its one year anniversary and offer many thank yous for
consistently being an exceptional event.  Yay lex!

The details:

YARD
7:30 October 26th, 2002
at the Auburn Saloon
712 First Street SE
just north of Stephen's Ave

Hope to see you there!  Or if not there then I hope to see you soon!

Case Summary:

Ms. Joan C Fitzgerald presented at our emergency service on 10/23 for
treatment of an infected ingrown toenail.  The toe was infected up to the
second joint and debriding and treatment with a local antibiotic was
performed, and oral treatment with penicillin was initiated.  Patient was
advised not to use toxic nail polish on her toes and not to chew on them.
Patient  was then admitted to Skinner-4 (psych) on a 2-PC involuntary
commitment order for inpatient observation and possible treatment, based on
her behavior in the registration department at the ER.  A transcript
follows:

“Name”

“Fitzgerald.  Joan C.  Why do you care?”

“We need a name to keep track of each of our patients so that we can give
them individualized service.  Plus we need someone to bill.”

“Well you can’t bill me.  My toe is infected.  I am not infected.  Why
should I pay when it is my toe that is infected?”

“This is just registration.  You must wait to discuss your medical problems
with the doctor.”

“Address?”

“It depends on who I crash with.”

“Well where should we send the statement?”

“I told you I am not responsible for my toe.  Send it a statement: Big Toe,
Left foot, Left Leg Joan Fitzgerald.  That’s its address.”

“Ok, we’ll move on.  Next of kin?”

“My children won’t have anything to do with me.”

“Well whom may we contact in case of an emergency?”

“Oh!  That’s easy.  My lover.”

“And what is her name?”

“His: Osama”

”Last name?”

“Laden”

“Middle initial?”

“B.”

“And his address?”

“No fixed address, Haven’t you been watching the news?”

“Well how do you find him?”

“I leave out an offering of Vodka.  He tries to be a good, strict Muslim,
but he got addicted to Vodka during the Soviet Occupation.  Mind you it has
to be Russian Vodka,. And nothing cheap.  And there has to be at least 5
bottles so he can spend a whole evening at it.  He has an amazing tolerance
for alcohol, only he gets these strange political ideas when he’s drunk.
Sober, he’s peace itself..  But he isn’t often sober.  And he won’t stay
with me once the drink runs out, he has to go get more.”

“but how does he come?”

“by spiritual Aeroflot charters.”

“spiritual?”

“well he can’t exactly get on a normal flight and show his passport, can he?
Plus, being somewhere between dead or alive like Schrodinger’s cat, he has
to use a non corporeal means of transportation,”

“Ms. Fitzgerald.  Will you wait here while I go get the doctor so you can
tell her what you just told  me?”

“NO!  I WANNA GO HOME!  I DON”T CARE IF MY TOE HAS TO BE AMPUTATED I DON’T
CARE IF MY FOOT HAS TO BE AMPUTATED.  I AM GOING HOME”

At this point hospital security guards surrounded Ms. Fitzgerald and
restrained her to a stretcher using four-point leather restraints, She
started screaming and singing Home on the Range as a protest song implying
that she wants to go home.

Patients’s severe agitation was treated with 10 mg Haldol IM, administered
with great difficultly since she was able to write away from the needle
despite the restraints.  After tightening the restraints, the injects was
successfully administered and patient became calmer and more composed and
her behavior improved.  Haldol IM prn was continued during he 5 week
inpatient stay in Skinner-4, where she was well enough to have her
restraints removed after 3 1/2 weeks although she spent the remaining time
in the quiet room.

Patient left the hospital calm and collected and had no outbursts, She did
not mention Osama bin Laden for the last week.

She will continue to receive Haldol IM an outpatient basis, perhaps
converted to long acting Haldol decanoate if the Haldol remains
well-tolerated.

Conclusion: successful hospitalization.  Patient much improved.
Schizophrenic symptoms in remission.

(these are texts from the moo environment I built at LinguaMoo called

luckily I just uncovered a paper copy in my notes.)

~ compost - transmute - death ~

All matter accumulates momentus toward its decomposition.  Over the
lapse of time, seven probabilities of involution - data broken down to
an indivisible binary.  Only later the humic layer recycles any
material's reconfiguration.  "Does binary information experience time?"
  "But do neurons? Do they experience their own decay?"

~ selfsame - sterile ~

Mutually transgressive specie are evolving beyond recognized patterns
of fruition.  Data penetrating replication itself suppose that parallel
dataspheres mirror parthnogenetic causality.

~ terminal - sever ~

Active termination enables energy for the production of new growth.
Where endings coincide with endings, rapid disparities elongate
similarly unpredictable patterns.  Asynchronous termination, much like
a forest, remains, stratified, sustained.

~ migration - dispersal ~

Movement as described by the flow of see-bytes across environments.
Genetic survival is enhanced as new self-similar guilds colonize the
medium.  Singularity is randomly responsible for unfolding designs.

~ moisture - water ~

We are water.  In the larger metacycle of natural process moisture
stabilizes the advance of evolutionary protocol.  In digitalogical
transference, fluidity assures predictable permutations & an abundance
of chaotic mutators.

~ pestilence - unhealthy ~

The flora is only as healthy as that which it resists.  Entities
formerly known as Disease Plague Blight & Infestation resemble the most
dreaded constructs of our worst fears.

~ hybrid - cross - exhale ~

Until a plant exhales it cannot replenish the life-force of another,
cannot mark new territory or undertake parenting new genetics.
Internet remains a convoluted model of the planet's potential neural
networks endlessly rewiring its synapses.

~ pollination - fertility - transference ~

A plant wound around itself cannot be completed with the interchange of
its opposite force.

~ center - genome - parent ~

The grand resolution of all lineage comes to a binary pinhole, by
necessity the creatrix of info-similar offspring.  Assuming the
existence of flora is relevant in the hypersphere, these first inklings
of phyto experimentation will imprint everything to follow.

Please also remember that the A.N.S.W.E.R. coalition is really the
Internation Action Center, which supports such "peacemakers" as Slobadan
Milosevic.

I'm not, I repeat not, saying don't go to the demos. It is unlikely the
mainstream media will make this connection, and god knows Georgie W. won't.
They'll just be counting numbers. I can say that I, for one, remain

"America speaks with one voice." -- George W. Bush

Another reminder to all that this Saturday, Oct 26, is a National Day of
Protest against the Bush administration's proposed war with Iraq.

There will be a march on Washington, there is a rally in San Francisco. But
as most of us cannot be in DC or SF, we are encouraging protests that range
from sign-posting (on your office door, your car, in your yard or window)
to sign-carrying, from letters to your local papers and representatives to
the picketing of local tv stations and newspapers. Remember, the media have
not been covering the protests satisfactorily: we should take our message
to the media too. The following url indexes local action groups around the
nation. Check it and see if anything's being organized for your area:

Also, you can download and print flyers for the protest here:

You rise from some new serum contrived from some new
raining in
love with the volume of self in the midst. You rise
with some
blunt stomach with faded grails and such world
breaking and your
eye slides down a rifle's scope to limn variable
pressure on
restaurant overcrowding. Shoulder-to-shoulder we
gesture and
carry our blood down the blacktop away from roads just

unfinished. Further and faster we sabotage these
razors that
spackle in gumdrop our televised detournment.
     The marksman: uncommunistic, lying in lyric
waiting for no
struggle of frontal blown. I must have awakened in the
shell of
new winter, measuring the frosts that jangle in my
hair against
the freezerburn on lyrical basilisk receipts. What
world there is
when she aims low across the street is sucked like
tequila down
to salt lemon lining for the roads away from blocking
off traffic
forever. Airplanes muscle the first tones of Eno
through a sky
unfounded and growling with sepsis.
     The marks on the raindrop: the muzzle on the
rifle: the
finality of stabbing disco: where will we walk unaimed
for now?

The first pressings of my hair start in the game of
rain. Once
you move one chip to the right, hoping to second-guess
what first-
off wills itself florid in masks, a reversal waits
behind the
slamming of limpid doors. As predicted, the sound
quality in
these early recordings leaves something desirable on
your bedside
table. Last night I stroke you deeper, pinning you to
the
softness of your own overgrown flesh; we harvest
celibacy in a
garden of lapping pauses, such and so many of the
tongues of
silences cracking our names like walnuts on the shelves.

Noticing an increase in the volume of poetic contributions to the list, I'm
wondering how these daily contributions are actually written or produced. I
guess some are slower than others but it takes me days or weeks or even
months to write something the same length of some of Alan Sondheim's work
(or at least something I'd let slip into the pubic domain).By the feel of
many of them, they could be spontaneous or automatic (as in surrealist
automatic) ...

I remember a while back Jesse brought up something to do with these pieces
being "written" by programs, or something of the like. If that is the case,
would attributions like "originality" be placed on the creation of the code
or algorithm that produced the language, or done away with completely?

Sorry, if this comes across as an unbelievably laconic and half formed
question.

   Joanne Kyger has played a vital role in the American poetry scene for
more than four decades and has been associated with nearly every innovative
poetry tendency during that time, from the San Francisco Renaissance and th=
e
Beats to the postmodern movements of today. One of the major experimenters,
hybridizers, and visionaries of poetry, Kyger is very much a poet of place,
with a sensibility that is delicate, graceful, and never wasteful. Her poem=
s
explore themes of friendship, love, community, and morality, and draw on
Native American sources as well as the path of Buddhist philosophy. Kyger=B9s
love for poetry manifests itself in a grander scheme of
consciousness-expansion and lesson, but always in the realm of the everyday=
.
Her most recent books include P=E1tzcuaro (San Francisco: Blue Millennium,
1999), Some Life (Sausalito: Post-Apollo Press, 2000), Strange Big Moon: Th=
e

Again (Albuquerque: La Alameda Press, 2001), and the long awaited As Ever:
Selected Poems (Penguin Putnam, 2002).

Subject:      Report from Czech Republic Poetry Festival
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Andrew & all, I'm just back from a 5 day festival called Poezie bez hranic,
Poetry without Borders (nice irony there for us) in Olomouc, CZ, Oct 9-13.
Mostly poets from CZ & Eastern Europe, but also Russia, Germany,Ireland,
Wales, France, etc. Four Americans, Jerry Rothenberg, Georgia Scott (pen
name of Cheryl Alexander Malcolm), Galway Kinnell, and me. Most of us did
OK for humility, I thought, but Kinnell played superstar, being picked up
at Prague, driven to the festival at midnight, not attending any events
that I could tell, and leaving right after his reading. He read the New
Yorker thing, "When the Towers Fell," and some poems from a book just
translated into Czech. Georgia Scott (who lives & teaches in Gdansk Poland)
did a great performance reading of erotic poems in a bordello, Eroticky
Klub Gejsa. Other readings were held in a great underground cafe/bar, the
Ponorka, in a museum, some art galleries, a museum-auditorium, a city
pavilion hall. Rothenberg read twice, actually, the second time as his part
of a panel on Pound. I read to the largest audience of my life, with the
help of a Czech actor reading some poems in translation, and then Petr
Mikes, a Czech poet/translator/publisher/friend and I read the new work I'd
done this summer, and which he & I had been working on translating over the
days of the festival. Where the humility, humiliation really, comes in is
in realizing that we live in a society that cares very little to not at all
about what we do, and that in other societies this is not necessarily  the
case. To walk through Mahlerova (Mahler Street) to the theatre where he was
orchestra director, to learn that Mozart wrote/premiered his 6th symphony
in a cathedral there (at age 11), to see posters & banners all over the
city promoting a poetry festival, and to see all events standing room only,
with enthusiastic audiences of young and old, to see full press coverage,
just extraordinary. There's a whole world out there! People who read!
Sylvester

haven't had a chance to look at _Short Fuse but assume there is no mention
of _Homo Sonorus, for example which might have given it some historical and
international legitimacy?

I'm intrigued by your asking about/for a metalanguage and why this
should/could differ from a metalanguage for poetry?  I'm bemusing here on
several things.  One is the term metalanguage (I do seem to be in a
definitional rut these days, but?) "meta" here seems to denote above or
superior to language while for me the real meat is on a level with or
possibly beneath language (sublanguage?).

I was also intrigued by your question of performance poetry on the page but
on reflection wonder if this is the issue.  I find these days that I
experience my writing as performance or at least action or gesturebut I'm
not sure this wasn't always the case.  This gestural experience may have had
it's roots inthe experience of learning to tell poetry from prose (despite
Merleau =Ponty's _Prose of the World) or the discovery of webpoetry or
animated poetry.  I find i now try to do it in 'reading' poetry as
experiencing poetry now as well.

Thanks for the update, Sylvester.  To what do you attribute their enthusiasm (I mean, beyond the inherent interest of the poets)?  I suppose it's the American illiteracy and indifference that really need to be explained, but can you hazard a conjecture about why conditions seem better there?

Does it partly reflect a European government's commitment to funding such things?  Is it something in Czech beer?

Kent,

Your guess, about the downloadable Adobe titles being
ranked separately in comparison only to Adobe sales,
is an intelligent one that hadn't occured to me.
Despite the phenomenal ---anomalous?--- surprise of
Silliman's Amazon Adobe ranking, I didn't explore any
of the questions that that list raised, though they
were numerous.  Amazon is very unforthcoming with
on-line clarification about the rankings; what I
quoted at the bottom of my post is the whole of what
they provide, as far as I could find under Help: "The
calculation is based on Amazon.com sales and is
updated regularly. The top 10,000 best sellers are
updated each hour to reflect sales in the preceding 24
hours. The next 100,000 are updated daily. The rest of
the list is updated monthly, based on several
different factors."  The key lies shrouded somewhere
in that cryptic "several different factors."

There seems to be some sort of additional time factor,
I think.  Ashbery, for example, outsells himself by
6,670 (~Chinese Whispers~) to 825,229 (~Your Name
Here~), which seems strangely implausible.  There are
other, unlikely contradictions even within the small
press, equally recent titles: Gordon/Sullivan's
~Swoon~ (689,659) outranks Gordon/Sullivan's ~Are Not
Our Lowing Heifers~ (1,610,791) ~by a million!~


Shouldn't it be assumed, too, that since there's a
third time line of new titles constantly being added,
that the heap is larger at the top (a downward pyramid
shape), so that the rankings are weighted by the
chronology of their publication, the older titles
experiencing the least "competition"?

Most of the 10,000 - 100,000 rankings ("updated
daily"), such as T.S. Eliot's or O'Hara's ~Collected,~
despite the exceptional fame of those poets, would
seem to be stagnant sales, in my opinion, as they're
outdated (O'Hara: 1995; the Eliot: 1963!?) and, in a
sense from a 2002 sales perspective, their hour has
passed.  That is, titles published at a time when
money was freer or on-line book-buying enjoyed a
greater vogue would maintain ~a permanent advantage~
over rankings from lean years.

Caveat, too, that the rankings cannot be exactly
equated with number of copies sold (you: "that way AY
beats John Ashbery's Selected"--- although I think his
Selected, in particular, would have greatly undersold
any of his ongoing titles, as he's the kind of poet
whose audience follows on a title by title basis [I,
for example, never bought the Selected])).

Bok's ~Eunoia,~ which ranks as Amazon 52,500, was
reported by its publisher, Coach House, to have sold
11,000 copies.

A few years ago, when I managed to seduce out of one
of Ashbery's publishers an admission about his print
run, I was told around 4,000 copies per title/edition
(!).

Can Mullen's ~Sleeping With The Dictionary,~ at that
date before the National Book Award news, be presumed
to have had a print run much greater than the small
press standard 1000 or so for such a title?

IMPORTANTLY, too: If you look at something like
Olson's ~Maximus,~ (219,051) which I would guess
enjoys virtually ~no~ sales anymore (the same, forlorn
single copy in the Manhattan Upper West Side Barnes &
Noble has been sitting on the shelves for ~years~), at
some point in the rankings very quickly the sales
probably withers away to dozens ~or less.~  The list
probably, in fact, includes *ZERO* sales,

after a reasonably early point! (Would there be any
reason for Brad Gooch's 1994 out-of-print limited
availability ~City Poet~ [821,381] to be selling
anymore?  How many copies of Giorgio De Chirico's
novel, ~Hebdomeros,~ published in 1993, could possibly
be selling in 2002?--- but the ranking is [a ~high~]
274,131.) . . . where the difference in ranking would
reflect only that *the Z,000,000th title was added as
a ~potential~ ISBN one million many titles after the
Y,000,000th title.*


Also, unknown is how Amazon's "Used & New" sales
option figures in: "Used & New" can get the buyer
~Maximus~ for $2.31.  The ranking doesn't
differentiate between what prices the title could've
been bought at, and its effect.

As you can see from the dollar signs that are still
floating around in that list, I was at first curious
how cost might correlate with ranking, . . . but, for
one afternoon's amusement, it all soon proved too
baffling.  The two titles that originally interested
Gary Sullivan, for example, ~Aloud~ and the Norton
~Post-Modern Poetry,~ compare at $12.98/$9.02 (list
price/Used & New) versus $18.87/$13.50 (as I recall,
the latter was higher back on the day that I made the
list: their discounting also happens at some
unexplained rate),--- so that, assuming Amazon
shoppers to be by the very nature of the medium
price-conscious, that would have a leveling effect on
the differences in rankings or "poetic value".


An interesting on-line bookseller to compare is Barnes
& Noble: whereas I can't figure out how to get Amazon
to show their poetry bestsellers sequentially beyond
the 25th title, Barnes & Noble allows you to review
their poetry bestsellers up to the 2,876th.

http://browse.barnesandnoble.com/controller?visgrp=fiction&slinkprefix=userid%3D6QTFY3QO2N&n=343517&g=343517+343516&sid=D6563DB4BF0E&act=M1

On first glance, they seem to sell less poetry (that
is, more non-poetry than poetry), but, by comparative
rankings, the logic is a conundrum: there, Billy
Collins' ~Nine Horses~ (1,002 on Amazon) is their
243rd; Creeley's ~Best American Poetry~ (2,583 on
Amazon) is 31,289; . . . But a Joe Ceravolo title is
2698th! and $70.00 price tags are not enough to
dissuade buyers from turning Jean Froissart's ~Prison
Amoureuse~ and ~The Songs of the Women Troubadours~
into 1896th and 1897th.  The 1982 720 pp. Oxford
~Godfrey of Bulloigne: A Critical Edition of Edward
Fairfax's Translation of Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata,
together with Fairfax's Original Poems~ (not even
listed on Amazon) is poetry # 1091! (which I guess
means a single section of an obscure university course
is enough to outsell thousands of poetry titles?)

Could, for example, Amazon's last 1,000,000th titles
or some range of it consist ~only~ of poetry titles,
which "do not sell"?!


There's Amazon # 65,971, for example, Jorie Graham's
~Dream of a Unified Field,~ which the Buffalo Poetics
List Post under

http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9703&L=poetics&P=R12027&I=-3

quotes Publishers Weekly as selling 8,500 copies; but
the book ~Poetry Like Bread,~ which the same source
claims sold 9,000 copies, comes in as Amazon # 310,638
(a difference of 500 copies would translate into an
inverse rankings difference of around 250,000??).
Etc.: Incommunicado Press' rock poetry ~Any Rough
Times Are Now Behind You,~ at 5,000 copies, is Amazon
# 190,379. So, these sources do not dependably
corroborate each other.  (I suspect fudging in the
publishers' reported sales figures: aren't they really
using those reports as a form of advertising to
increase future sales?)

Jewel's legendary ~A Night Without Armor,~ which "sold
for a reported $1 million", ranks 7,481 on Amazon.

(http://www.pw.org/mag/newsparker0901.htm)

Paul McCartney's ~Blackbird Singing,~ (Amazon 7,627 in
hardcover, 29,504 in soft) was estimated to have sold
approximately *3,750* copies in its first year, last
year (same source as above).


In posting that list, which was very casually done off
the top of my head, what I hoped would show was what I
saw in its details: that it contradicts itself and is
statistically a very peculiar and unfathomable
indicator (certainly not of "poetic value").  One of
the problems is that, without plugging in a host of
non-poetry titles that I can't even think of since my
interests are so narrow (---under Outdoor Cooking
books, ~Weber's Big Book of Grilling~ is # 1,667! or,
under *Canning & Preserving* titles, ~The Joy of
Pickling: 200 Flavor-Packed Recipes for All Kinds of
Produce from Garden or Market~ is 28,286!---), into
the gaps between one poetry ranking and the next,
there's no way of telling quite what those rankings
represent in the full library of what we might
consider viable reading.  (I can't even seem,
intentionally, to ~drive~ the Browse Subjects feature
low enough to reflect how infinitesimal the poetry
rankings are: under Craft and Hobbies [*Applique*],
~Better Homes and Gardens 501 Quilt Blocks: A Treasury
of Patterns for Patchwork and Applique~ is Amazon #
8,281! and, under Lace & Tatting, even ~Terrific
Tassels & Fabulous Fringe~ is # 76,511!!)



...Nice hearing from you.  Sorry if I was gruff at
your snideness about Saussure and the Saturnian poets
a while back.  I've been surprised, now that the more
"liberal" List policies let Gabriel Gudding squeak
through Homeland Security, that you yourself haven't
re-enlisted (unless you already have under a different
name, heh heh heh, and just found the climate too
terribly changed).  I look forward to reading your
Greek thing.  My best to Ammonides and that rock band
kid of his.

Today's golden with engineering, Brad says to Brittany
over the covers, who plows through the dark like a
rifle's antique fin evoking erect series' retention
with impacted capacities. "Sky's like an antique paper
or the skin of old plants meshing with horizontal
nodes."
        Today, it shoulde be noted, loads into a new browser
window via javascript popup advertising; ineffective
as it may be, and  regardless of function rs(n,u,w,h)
{
  remote = window.open(u, n, 'width=' + w + ',height='
+ h +',resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes');
  if (remote != null) {
    if (remote.opener == null)
      remote.opener = self;
    window.name = 'myYahooRoot';
    remote.location.href = u;
  }. Maybe there's blood in your mouth, which commends
with hooks the waters and their skimming over: Brad
and Brittany asleep,  eyelids pressed like petals on
the white box truck foaming, we got the whole of the
sun nozzled in our vegetation outside, he whispers to
her rustily over an older skin of ferns brushing
japanese calligraphy, maybe there's blond in your
month of modes spilling lipid dreams.
        body { color:#000000; background:#ffffff;
font-family:frutiger,arial,helvetica; font-size:10pt;}
body A { color:#000000; }

        My body is no color of notepad stretched, she
mentions in passing a sport utility vehicle primed
with a powerful bomb slammed into an Israeli bus at
rush hour here this afternoon, and once more we're as
naked and as soft as new skin ready for puncture going
to work. "I think today may be more amber," you gasp,
the engine and transmission of the vehicle carrying
the explosives lay some 50 yards from the bus, by a
left leg severed below the knee.

Subject:      politically conservative poets in the U.S. since 1950?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

A student in my Experience of Poetry class asked me an interesting question
the other day. His reasons for asking the question aren't interesting, but I
thought the question was:

"Aren't there any political conservative poets in the U.S.?"

Now, let's say that what he means, in this instance, by conservative is a
fairly conventional U.S. definition--someone who votes for the Republican
Party. So I don't mean to include here poets who from the perspective of the
political and aesthetic radicals on this list (you know who you, uh, we, are)
might be called conservative because they don't like language poetry or write
conventional MFA narrative verse--those people, in my experience, may be
pro-capitalist Democrats, but they're never Republicans. They're mainstream,
but not conservative.

I'd also like to exclude from the last certain right wing radicals like, say,
Pound, who whatever the confusion in his fascism and Jeffersonian democracy
was never, as far as I know, a Republican.

So, who does that leave, especially if we talk about poets who came to
prominence in the 1950s and afterwards? Eliot, of the older Modernists, was
still around, but not in the United States. So there's Allen Tate, and
certainly James Dickey, the most prominent conservative poet from the 50s on
that I can think of right now. Other southern poets? William Jay Smith? Robert
Penn Warren I think was a southern Democrat, although probably he still
qualifies as conservative. Who else? Any Northern Republican poets? Even an
aesthetically conservative poet like Thomas McGrath was a long-time communist.
There's Carl Thayler, who Skanky Possum published, and who likes Joe McCarthy
and Calvin Coolidge, but he hardly qualifies as having any prominence. And
what, I wonder, does all this say about poetry in the U.S.? Maybe not much,
maybe something about the relationship between poetry and a market economy?
But for instance, my guess is that there are more politically conservative
poets in Britain, although I don't know for sure.

Names? Ideas?

Subject:      Re: Report from Czech Republic Poetry Festival
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Listers--

My guess is that what happens in the Czech republic is what happens
everywhere in the world EXCEPT the US.  I know it happens in Latin America
and especially in Argentina, which I know best.  The US dominates mass
entertainment media (movies, pop music, etc.)  The rest of the world
consumes our mass entertainment willingly and avidly, when they want
escapism.  But when they want to see characters and settings that bear some
resemblance to their own lives, they turn to works produced closer to home.
And since a movie, for example, with high production values is quite
expensive (and a relatively small language or culture group like the Dutch
or the Portuguese can't count on selling the work to outsiders), this work
expressing local scenes and problems is not likely to be a movie, but
instead a novel, a short story or even a poem.  The end result is that art
forms that require fewer resources and can be produced by individuals or
small groups still have substantial audiences and fulfull a non-elite need
in places like Buenos Aires, Amsterdam, Lima, and Lisbon.

I saw this myself in Buenos Aires, where Jorge Luis Borges, the writer of
fantastic, philosophical, and what we could consider "high culture" short
stories was such a celebrity that a truck driver stopped in traffic to get
his autograph and offer him a lift and a waitress in an airport coffee shop
excused herself, went back to her locker, and shyly produced a battered copy
of one of his books for him to sign.

So there's a price to be paid for living in the richest, most culturally
dominent nation in the world.  Other social and cultural currents are
operating as well, of course, but I really think that what I just described
is a big part of it.  Do listees in far corners of the world agree?

Whether or not a poet is an "aesthetic radical" is hardly an indication of
the politics.
One of our most aesthetically radical living poets characterizes himself as a
Libertarian and has voted Republican.  In fact, he is described in more than
one major reference book as the most experimental poet of our times.
Although I doubt that he unswervingly toes the Conservative line, just as I
doubt he has always voted Republican, his politics do swing right on several
issues.  For example, he is against Affirmative Action (He told me this face
to face.).  I am referring to Richard Kostelantetz.

Richard's aesthetics, judging by his "notes towards a theory" in a recent
issue of Moria, in their dismissal of the emotions and "extreme subject
matter," can only be described as Puritanical.  I suspect that some on and
off this list who fancy themselves on the left might agree with his Poetics.
This is not to impugn his--or anyone's--talent, politics, or product.  And
since Richard has made both his political and aesthetic leanings public on
many occasions, I am certainly not speaking out of school.

To be "aesthetically radical" is not, of course, synomymous with either
leftist politics or aesthetics.  Best, Bill

Preface to David Bromige's As in T As in Tether, by Robert Grenier:

    For David Bromige

     From Dream-time forward (long ago) there’s been desire to free
    oneself from all and sundray ‘constraints’ of what those most dear
    to one all around ‘want & expect me to do’ – I WON’T! Why? Because
    elsewise, I MUST DIE! (& they die, too – although, particularly
    here, they don’t know it – they don’t know they depend on ME! – to
    destroy us!) Hard to do, without rewriting the language itself down
    to its BONES/CRACKS/GRIMACES/SLIPPAGES/WELTS – BECAUSE IT”S STUPID
    AND WRONG! – tiger writhing in its chains (skin), like figure of
    Robert T.S. Lowell (on cover of Life Studies) in life, except worse
    (D.B. himself makes them up, bounds, then sets out to destroy them,
    by using ‘them’ against themselves) (agent of the English language
    itself?) – all in the name of a possible human life (“the
    metamorphoses of many organs show what wonderful changes in function
    are at least possible” – Darwin), e.g. in Sebastopol – which he
    herein demonstrates (as in “ ‘T’ as in ‘Tethered’”) – with more
    sense/result and good humor than that other Hippocratic
    gallstone/sticker fellow
    Tristam-Gulliver-Beckett-Quixote-Lawrence-Alec Guinness?, I don’t
    know. (D.B. lives in part to ‘poke fun’ at figure of Alec Guinness
    in Bridge On The River Kwai.) So the ‘New World’ is another writing
    in words – at least potentially – though these words must (equally)
    now be attacked as FALSE from Day One (and true).

    Like being in jail, except – through the ‘glissement des signes’
    (‘play’ of languages) – something?

    How this GOOD WRITING changes the oncoming catastrophe, I’m not sure
    (can’t say).

    Doesn’t ‘profit them’ to grille me!

    A sheaf of fresh red-brown white-washed (‘Norwegian’) hair & beard
    grizzled eyeing you quizzically blue-eyed affectionately lang-po
    death-of-the-author freethinking people declare yourself – an
    off-rhyme – working class, germane to the situation, to wit – a box
    (why not, you put it together?) – you make it yourself, then walk
    round inside it! (it is ‘The World’!) – you revile the box, & spit
    upon it! ! – with a lyrical instinct wont to destroy the Avant Garde
    along with it – un grand <<blaze>> des grizzled (signatures) signes
    – results in (both) a certain dissatisfaction with humans (& the
    ‘world’) & yet (well-established/superior/separate) says what it is,
    anyway, for it. How else could it be ‘better represented’?

This is an interesting but frustrating discussion - When I produced the =
audio edition of Kenning, I had to press 1000 copies of the double-CD =
package.  In an effort to widen the "market" for such things, I offered =
the CD through Amazon.  They ordered exactly two copies, both of which =
remain in a warehouse someplace, and hence it has NO sales ranking.  If =
I'd have sold a total of 100 copies (via any various means) I'd have =
made my money back (excluding grants received, etc).

I don't reckon any small or mirco press publisher believes they'll make =
a profit or sell out of their print run - or, depends on such lucky =
occurrences.  On the other hand, breaking even would be nice, and would =
allow someone like me to stay on a regular production schedule.  I =
always said I'd rather have a handful of careful and otherwise =
'invested' readers / listeners for Kenning, but sales flat-out begin to =
matter when it comes to projects such as this, which, seem to warrant =
the 3-4000 dollars that go into their manufacture and distribution.  On =
the other hand, those who've received a review copy or been given a free =
copy from a contributor etc have been eager to express their =
appreciation ...=20

I did read somewhere that Jewel has apparently outsold Whitman.

Kent,


Your guess, about the downloadable Adobe titles being
ranked separately in comparison only to Adobe sales,
is an intelligent one that hadn't occured to me.
Despite the phenomenal ---anomalous?--- surprise of
Silliman's Amazon Adobe ranking, I didn't explore any
of the questions that that list raised, though they
were numerous.  Amazon is very unforthcoming with
on-line clarification about the rankings; what I
quoted at the bottom of my post is the whole of what
they provide, as far as I could find under Help: "The
calculation is based on Amazon.com sales and is
updated regularly. The top 10,000 best sellers are
updated each hour to reflect sales in the preceding 24
hours. The next 100,000 are updated daily. The rest of
the list is updated monthly, based on several
different factors."  The key lies shrouded somewhere
in that cryptic "several different factors."



There seems to be some sort of additional time factor,
I think.  Ashbery, for example, outsells himself by
6,670 (~Chinese Whispers~) to 825,229 (~Your Name
Here~), which seems strangely implausible.  There are
other, unlikely contradictions even within the small
press, equally recent titles: Gordon/Sullivan's
~Swoon~ (689,659) outranks Gordon/Sullivan's ~Are Not
Our Lowing Heifers~ (1,610,791) ~by a million!~






Shouldn't it be assumed, too, that since there's a
third time line of new titles constantly being added,
that the heap is larger at the top (a downward pyramid
shape), so that the rankings are weighted by the
chronology of their publication, the older titles
experiencing the least "competition"?



Most of the 10,000 - 100,000 rankings ("updated
daily"), such as T.S. Eliot's or O'Hara's ~Collected,~
despite the exceptional fame of those poets, would
seem to be stagnant sales, in my opinion, as they're
outdated (O'Hara: 1995; the Eliot: 1963!?) and, in a
sense from a 2002 sales perspective, their hour has
passed.  That is, titles published at a time when
money was freer or on-line book-buying enjoyed a
greater vogue would maintain ~a permanent advantage~
over rankings from lean years.



Caveat, too, that the rankings cannot be exactly
equated with number of copies sold (you: "that way AY
beats John Ashbery's Selected"--- although I think his
Selected, in particular, would have greatly undersold
any of his ongoing titles, as he's the kind of poet
whose audience follows on a title by title basis [I,
for example, never bought the Selected])).



Bok's ~Eunoia,~ which ranks as Amazon 52,500, was
reported by its publisher, Coach House, to have sold
11,000 copies.



A few years ago, when I managed to seduce out of one
of Ashbery's publishers an admission about his print
run, I was told around 4,000 copies per title/edition
(!).



Can Mullen's ~Sleeping With The Dictionary,~ at that
date before the National Book Award news, be presumed
to have had a print run much greater than the small
press standard 1000 or so for such a title?



IMPORTANTLY, too: If you look at something like
Olson's ~Maximus,~ (219,051) which I would guess
enjoys virtually ~no~ sales anymore (the same, forlorn
single copy in the Manhattan Upper West Side Barnes &
Noble has been sitting on the shelves for ~years~), at
some point in the rankings very quickly the sales
probably withers away to dozens ~or less.~  The list
probably, in fact, includes *ZERO* sales,



after a reasonably early point! (Would there be any
reason for Brad Gooch's 1994 out-of-print limited
availability ~City Poet~ [821,381] to be selling
anymore?  How many copies of Giorgio De Chirico's
novel, ~Hebdomeros,~ published in 1993, could possibly
be selling in 2002?--- but the ranking is [a ~high~]
274,131.) . . . where the difference in ranking would
reflect only that *the Z,000,000th title was added as
a ~potential~ ISBN one million many titles after the
Y,000,000th title.*






Also, unknown is how Amazon's "Used & New" sales
option figures in: "Used & New" can get the buyer
~Maximus~ for $2.31.  The ranking doesn't
differentiate between what prices the title could've
been bought at, and its effect.



As you can see from the dollar signs that are still
floating around in that list, I was at first curious
how cost might correlate with ranking, . . . but, for
one afternoon's amusement, it all soon proved too
baffling.  The two titles that originally interested
Gary Sullivan, for example, ~Aloud~ and the Norton
~Post-Modern Poetry,~ compare at $12.98/$9.02 (list
price/Used & New) versus $18.87/$13.50 (as I recall,
the latter was higher back on the day that I made the
list: their discounting also happens at some
unexplained rate),--- so that, assuming Amazon
shoppers to be by the very nature of the medium
price-conscious, that would have a leveling effect on
the differences in rankings or "poetic value".






An interesting on-line bookseller to compare is Barnes
& Noble: whereas I can't figure out how to get Amazon
to show their poetry bestsellers sequentially beyond
the 25th title, Barnes & Noble allows you to review
their poetry bestsellers up to the 2,876th.

M1



On first glance, they seem to sell less poetry (that
is, more non-poetry than poetry), but, by comparative
rankings, the logic is a conundrum: there, Billy
Collins' ~Nine Horses~ (1,002 on Amazon) is their
243rd; Creeley's ~Best American Poetry~ (2,583 on
Amazon) is 31,289; . . . But a Joe Ceravolo title is
2698th! and $70.00 price tags are not enough to
dissuade buyers from turning Jean Froissart's ~Prison
Amoureuse~ and ~The Songs of the Women Troubadours~
into 1896th and 1897th.  The 1982 720 pp. Oxford
~Godfrey of Bulloigne: A Critical Edition of Edward
Fairfax's Translation of Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata,
together with Fairfax's Original Poems~ (not even
listed on Amazon) is poetry # 1091! (which I guess
means a single section of an obscure university course
is enough to outsell thousands of poetry titles?)



Could, for example, Amazon's last 1,000,000th titles
or some range of it consist ~only~ of poetry titles,
which "do not sell"?!






There's Amazon # 65,971, for example, Jorie Graham's
~Dream of a Unified Field,~ which the Buffalo Poetics
List Post under



http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=3Dind9703&L=3Dpoetics&P=3D=
R12027&I=3D-3



quotes Publishers Weekly as selling 8,500 copies; but
the book ~Poetry Like Bread,~ which the same source
claims sold 9,000 copies, comes in as Amazon # 310,638
(a difference of 500 copies would translate into an
inverse rankings difference of around 250,000??).
Etc.: Incommunicado Press' rock poetry ~Any Rough
Times Are Now Behind You,~ at 5,000 copies, is Amazon
# 190,379. So, these sources do not dependably
corroborate each other.  (I suspect fudging in the
publishers' reported sales figures: aren't they really
using those reports as a form of advertising to
increase future sales?)



Jewel's legendary ~A Night Without Armor,~ which "sold
for a reported $1 million", ranks 7,481 on Amazon.



(http://www.pw.org/mag/newsparker0901.htm)



Paul McCartney's ~Blackbird Singing,~ (Amazon 7,627 in
hardcover, 29,504 in soft) was estimated to have sold
approximately *3,750* copies in its first year, last
year (same source as above).






In posting that list, which was very casually done off
the top of my head, what I hoped would show was what I
saw in its details: that it contradicts itself and is
statistically a very peculiar and unfathomable
indicator (certainly not of "poetic value").  One of
the problems is that, without plugging in a host of
non-poetry titles that I can't even think of since my
interests are so narrow (---under Outdoor Cooking
books, ~Weber's Big Book of Grilling~ is # 1,667! or,
under *Canning & Preserving* titles, ~The Joy of
Pickling: 200 Flavor-Packed Recipes for All Kinds of
Produce from Garden or Market~ is 28,286!---), into
the gaps between one poetry ranking and the next,
there's no way of telling quite what those rankings
represent in the full library of what we might
consider viable reading.  (I can't even seem,
intentionally, to ~drive~ the Browse Subjects feature
low enough to reflect how infinitesimal the poetry
rankings are: under Craft and Hobbies [*Applique*],
~Better Homes and Gardens 501 Quilt Blocks: A Treasury
of Patterns for Patchwork and Applique~ is Amazon #
8,281! and, under Lace & Tatting, even ~Terrific
Tassels & Fabulous Fringe~ is # 76,511!!)









...Nice hearing from you.  Sorry if I was gruff at
your snideness about Saussure and the Saturnian poets
a while back.  I've been surprised, now that the more
"liberal" List policies let Gabriel Gudding squeak
through Homeland Security, that you yourself haven't
re-enlisted (unless you already have under a different
name, heh heh heh, and just found the climate too
terribly changed).  I look forward to reading your
Greek thing.  My best to Ammonides and that rock band
kid of his.

Colleagues:

My new book, entitled "Method," will be published in December 2002. Since my publisher is counting
on the profits from the sale of this book to take his wife out for what he calls "a swell time at
Dunkin' Donuts," it is incumbent upon me to do something to promote the work. If anyone knows of
reading venues around the country that would offer safe harbor (and a no-nonsense honorarium) to a
vagabond visiting poet, I'd be grateful to hear from you. More information about myself and/or the
book by back channel.

Thanks.

I find this very useful to know, how other cultures
react to their writers and to poetry in general.  I
know that when I lived in Israel in the late 80s,
celebrity as a whole was on a much smaller
scale--there was not so much class difference then, so
it was likely that the nation's biggest pop star lived
in the same apt building you did.  And they definitely
revere their poets and writers, although this was
mostly true of the patriotic poets associated with
Israel's founding--I was too young at the time to
really know if there was a flourishing scene of
younger writers.

one of the intrinsic beauties to print on demand is that once you get
some titles up & going you can make the whole thing stay in the black,
because yr print costs after an initial edition are based on sales &
demand rather than imagined audience.  & I must say that thinking of
editioning thousands of copies (Im speaking in general, not
specifically to patrick's project) for the kind of work that we are
talking about here seems grandiose & Id like to suggest based on 20 yrs
of publisher/bookmaking experience that the numbers are "usually" much
more realistically in the 100-500 range.  I learned quite early that
closets full of books waiting to be sold does little more than
reinforce materialistic concepts of what it means to "publish" a book.

in this model the publisher is also bookmaker, a decided good thing.
it puts the maker in touch with materials, paper, ink, copiers &
presses, binding & in the age of mass-production creates value-added
products whose spirit/uniqueness is impossible to duplicate with "give
the printer a big check, get boxes of glossy perfect bounds in return"
style of printing.

also, realistically, these kinds of larger numbers & ideal imagined
readers is a much tighter & more economical fit with various modes of
web publishing.  html books, pdf books, etc.  thoughtfully done online,
they can take on a life of their own & infect their own subset of
readers.


one of the real questions is since much of this kind of literature is
affixed to university affiliation, why arent the universities working
to enact distribution models that supports micro publishers...  to some
extent there are a number of archives, but BOOK FAIRS have for some
reason been erased from the small press topology, & realistically
university settings are the only places that have the kind of resources
to create & bring these kind of events together.  in the 80s there was
seemingly an active network of such events, east coast, midcoast, west
coast which did much to build an excitement of community of readers &
writers/artists.

Yes, Miekal, thanks for taking the time to think this through. Small Press
Distribution - to whom I should direct this directly  - may do well(if it
has not) to engage a print-on-demand model for its publishers as a way for
publishers to limit expenses entailed in doing expensive runs that primarily
produce inventory, as well as a great way to keep books in print. SPD's
established web presence - with its identity framed around poetry and
innovative thought in most media - does and will give publishers a home, a
piece of turf, a visible "go to island" quite different than floating and
most often drowning in the Amazon slough (though it does not rule out Amazon
access to SPD listings.)

  What, however, is your experience of what is either lost or - to put it
another way - within the print-on-demand frame, how does a publisher
maintain a design aesthetic and production value. I guess a concern would be
that print-on-demand creates a monolithic look and feel (same paper and
cover stock, same tone to the inking, etc.) Locally, for a few examples,
it's nice to see the design separateness of AVEC, APOGEE, and ATELOS - where
you really get a book and/or series that declares itself as distinct from
each other and other presses.

 An apprehension here - in the I-universe print-on-demand model - of coming
up with visual mush - books without legs, arms, seduction or punch - where
production efficiency ironically ends up being a means of linguisitic
repression, or, at least, a sad limitation.

On your second point,  If SPD had the resources (including funding partners)
and an indefatigable impresario, they would also be an ideal Book
Fair/Poetry/Fiction Festival Venue (say in the early Fall here in the Bay
Area). In addition to bringing books to light, such could include readings,
lectures, dance party etc.

A Festival as a way to break away from life on the monitor into tangible
goods, visible, breathing, talking people, including strangers - as well as
meeting poets and other publishers-  and even selling a few books! A
Conference of all souls!

Stephen Vincent

I Reply in support of this worthy cause:

_Method_ should be on every bookshelf. For a glimpse of the sort of
poetry it contains, I'm reposting a poem I sent in last month. It's from
Mark Salerno's chapbook titled "Matters", which is a stylistic follow up to his
amazing, antic, _Method_.

--------------------------------------------
For Everyday Use

What matters most there's your rumpus
delicate simple wedge of winter light
some sea greens are building contrast
as the man in the orange suit directs
traffic in lost doubloons gold slots
this prison cell my lime tree bower
wherein the prelude becomes the power
O blimey the air is a memory of air
or how else to say it she wore a teal
cotton jersey she had small white hands
and finally we could see the underside
of leaves if only to stay the day as subject
in the ongoing vocabulary of telling.

---------------------------------------------

One of the things I admire about this poem is how well I find it aware
of itself thinking as it goes. How, after the "lime tree bower" /
"prelude" bit, we get "O blimey the air is a memory of air". I find
this playful, antic, and fundamentally true to the totality of
experience. I feel a little corner of the being of the world as
revealed itself here. And, as such, we all join "the ongoing
vocabulary of telling."

True-ly.

Sylvester, Paula, Arielle, Andy, listers,

The Taos Poetry Circus is an annual event of poetry, performance, =
workshops, open readings and the confluence of poets from diverse =
backgrounds. The Circus events take place in bars, cafes, conference =
centers and at UNM. Poets this year included: John Balaban reading in =
Vietnamese and English from a new book of translation- _Spring Rain_ , =
Anselm Hollo, Andrei Codrescu, Sekou Sundiata, Saul Williams, Juan =
Felipe Herrera, and Ntozake Shange. Feature poets from previous years =
include: Anne Waldman, Quincy Troupe, Simon Ortiz, Victor Hernandez =
Cruz, and Jimmy Santiago Baca.=20

The Circus draws approximately 2,000 people for the final event and is =
well attended throughout. While it may not have the polished look (in =
terms of banners and posters) of a state funded arts event, it was well =
promoted and the audience was diverse. The Circus begins at Taos Pueblo. =
Poems were performed or read in Spanish, Tewa, Tiwa, English, =
Vietnamese, with some Quechua and Nahuatl in the verbal mix. It is not =
uncommon for some of the featured poets to attend the open readings and =
read from their work as well. These are informal gatherings at a =
coffeehouse where people read and listen. They occur daily and are an =
integral part of the Circus.
Additionally, there is daily discourse on language: rules of language, =
poetic language(s), performance aspects/limitations of and the =
extinction of languages- there is an Institute in Santa Fe  with the =
sole mission of language preservation...many of the Native American =
languages are disappearing at an alarming rate, as well as many others =
in our "global culture."

While it may not be "far-flung", there is evidence of readers, writers, =
audience members, and an abbreviated representation of state support for =
the arts (the WPBA runs the Circus, grant funding is an essential =
component of their survival) in New Mexico. Peter Rabbit (Black =
Mountain) is one of the founders of the WPBA. It may be important to =
consider that Taos is perhaps culturally distinct from other places on =
the continent- given the presence of Taos Pueblo and the mingling of =
Native, Anglo and Spanish cultures that has been happening in the SW for =
several hundred years.=20

People all over Taos know about the Circus, attend events and greet =
Circus attendees with smiles and the query: are you a poet?

-Jane

Well, "conservative" and "liberal" and "leftist" have peculiar
meanings in the USA. From outside it is hard to see the difference
between your two parties, both of which would be seen as well to the
right in most democracies.

Small Press Traffic presents
Friday, October 25, 2002 at 7:30 pm
Tyrone Williams & Laura Moriarty

A key literary figure in the regional and international landscape, Laura
Moriarty?s work exists in nearly every established genre, and some not yet
established. Her recent books include Nude Memoir (Krupskaya, 2000), a poem
Taylor Brady calls "the best crime story you will read this year," The Case (O
Books, 2000), Symmetry (Avec, 1998), and the historically adventurous Cunning
(Spuyten Duyvil, 1999), a favorite because of its thick, novelly field. Former
archivist for the Poetry Center and editor/publisher of non, Moriarty
currently works at Small Press Distribution in Berkeley.

Tyrone Williams? debut collection of poetry, c.c., is just out from San
Francisco?s Krupskaya Publishing Collective. This is a volume which Nathaniel
Tarn says "bridges more gaps than many words (and careers) thrice as
long...the reference, as craft and time demand, is ever to mother language.
This [is] uncommon rapture, a burning repetition of home truths, in resolutely
future tense." Williams? work has appeared in Hambone, Callaloo, The Kenyon
Review, Artful Dodge, and elsewhere. Williams teaches literature, literary
theory and creative writing at Xavier University and recently co-edited a
collection of writings by the homeless in Cincinnati.

All events are $5-10, sliding scale, unless otherwise noted. Our events are

Charles' (CHAX) parallel discount offer for Tom Mandel's Prospect of Releas=
e
led me to liberate a little review of the work that somebody - I forget who
- somehow failed to publish some several years back. In the interest of
liberating/recycling/regenerating the dormant file and putting it back to
work in service in what I thought was a strong book, I add:

Let it be said PROSPECT FOR RELEASE is astonishingly good. Sonnets,
50 consecutive, interwoven works construct an elegy on the death of a
parent. Each sonnet is driven forward into the next by a Talmudic
insistence. There are strict laws (or codes?) =AD I am assuming - to the
commands of ritual for the dead and no sentiment will divert from the
instruction in which "release", release of the mourned one, the "absent"
one, is the sole objective. Relentless, one might almost say ruthlessly
patriarchal, each sonnet stays right on the threshold between "presence" an=
d
"absence" and, in the process, provides instruction and interpretation, to
he - in this case - who mourns:

For thirty days after death offer
consolation but do not ask the mourner
how he feels. Until twelve months

have pass, ask and offer. After
a year, no longer mention bereavement.
Don't lance his healed wound, or cure
her of a sickness that's past.

(Page 19)


In the context of an elegy -- what I take as quite novel -- is an almost
total effacement of particulars. We learn nada in the way of facts, the
remembered content of the loved one's life. Instead we watch/hear the
authorial voice submit, grieve and struggle to become articulate in the
sudden void. The suffering, the terror is palpable:

Although he gave me his pasture
-- where this means the benefit of his
advice, amusement, and bemusement
at my values, love of them and of me --

he cannot give me his grave --


Bravely, through a severity of a means, the poems rarely indulge in
contemporary metaphor. Rather these sonnets struggle to hear, interpret and
serve the depth of an archaic calling:

                      ...I prefer baked cake
to a handful of wheat, for nothing is known
without interpretation. Unarticulated,
a letter absorbs death, binds us end to
end, whereby the past avoids the present.
(Page 32)

As a literature must =AD as different from a personal memory =AD the void, the
absence fully realized, transfigures into the larger communal presence, a
grievance familiar, and here, courageously sustained, marvelously
transformed:

One whom I thought abandoned me returned.

Another I asked to stay must leave.
From you I learn better and now know why
each mind must bend, but only to its task,
soul dancing at the prospect of release.
(Page 58)

In risking the strictest of archaic means - Talmudic code within the formal
restraints of the sonnet --  Mandel's work ironically achieves a quite
moving, chillingly sober, contemporary power and resonance.

Since in poetry (at least in that of 20th century written in English) there
is a disconnect between what is called or considered radical in language and
the political beliefs of its practitioners, what is considered leftist or
rightist (radical or conservative) in those beliefs, I do not quite
understand the direction of this argument.

hi all,

i have to agree with (i think it ron on his blog) that the editors missed
something by not considering canadian sound poetry. aside from Kemp and
Sherri D. canada is represented by the montreal anglo scene. where are
scobie, bok, bissett, nichol and even me for that matter? it's happening
from coast to coast and has been for over thirty years.

set phasers to http://zed.cbc.ca/displayHome.do

and click on the performance

i think that cities or scenes often invent names to promote themselves
within their own city but fail to acknowledge similar things happening
other places becasue they are called different things.

for instance there was a round table discussion that featured many of the
"montreal spoken word scene" folks (it's not on-line any more) on the
broken pencil site. from reading it you would have gotten the impression
that the Nuyorcian was the only thing going in NYC. let alone the rest of
the country.

no point really. just want to point out that nomenclature is often
regional.

later,
kevin

I guess we need a bit of clarification on terms...  my use of print on
demand completely predates the kind of model that you have seen pop up
on the web in the last few years.  plug & play instant publication
gratification.  in this new web model, the publisher as such basically
disappears & is replaced with a form of preset replication.

what Xexoxial has done all these years is operate just as any other
good small press has done, having complete control over all aspects of
design, production, distribution etc.  If you have ever seen XE books,
each one has a unique feel & design, limited really only by what papers
& dimensions will feed thru a copier.  the key here is publication
equals the existence of a master printable copy which one can
continuously make new editions from.  when we were up & functioning
smoothly, we often had an intern, who was responsible for keeping up
with orders & keeping a small inventory (usually less than 25) on the
shelf & in print.  while I would say there is a very definite design
signature for our books, each one is recognizable as unique.  what
makes print & demand particularly appealing is now one could keep on
the masters for their whole press in quark files on a cd-r.  We have 7
files drawers full of paper masters, every page of every title (more
than a 150) was hand designed & glued with gluestick & penknife.  we
are at a point now where the next step is to digitize these masters
before they become brittle with age.

that is an apprehension which I could just as easily apply to
traditonally produced lit mags, small presses, websites, music cds,
&webart.  there is a craft, an attention, & for some of us a lifestyle
& vision which requires that what we produce is outputted in a way that
is not dismissed as a preset.  in many ways it calls for greater
sensitivity to experimentation with the media at hand.

also (yr hearing me say this after almost 6 years of exclusively making
work for online) micro publishing could not be in a more potentized &
enabled position.  a young person starting out with an excess of energy
& time has at their fingertips access to instant printing technology
(copiers, home color laser, inkjet), dsl & cable connection in the home
(for running yr own web server) & web technology at a point where
producing ebooks, mp3s, interactive digital lit can be distributed
online globally.  the key here is that the primary limitation is one's
own imagination, not financial resources.

while attending John Bennett's Avant 2 conference this summer I was
struck continuously by the fact of being in the room with a lot of
people who were still writing & publishing & networking with much of
the same spirit that was pervasive during the very energetic
"networking the networks" of the early 80s....  the books & the
publications are obviously a part of an enduring group process, not the
end in itself.

good to hear your voice on these issues..

I think that quite a few poets could be classified as Conservative in the
Burkean sense--Russell Kirk and Michael Oakeshott two conservative theorists
consider TS Eliot and Wallace Stevens as Conservatives. and Stevens was
involved in insurance which is not a Progressive business and in Kirk's book
"the conservative mind" they are quoted and included.  There are also many
poets like Pound,  D'Annunzzio, and many others who are poets of the r ight
but yet progressive in their poetics.  the comment below makes allot of
sense even the most liberal American would be a moderate in most places and
mostRightists in the USA are not the red blooded Fascist type they are just
milktoast

as a dog returns to his vomit

3. An instance of moria, not moira
this is my slow down
(my speed up is free)
my verse is a playground legend
real American fare
and I don't share
Christabel malleable as a crowd of celebrities
con gli occhi onesti e tardi
misfortunes directly from a plate
each Virginia is numbered to a violent end

We understand the oddity of this proposal, but we have been dealing with
formally performative language for the past few years, in order to look at
issues of virtual subjectivity, interaction, projection and introjection

"Performative" can be considered in any number of ways. For example, there
is a _trace_ function in the Julu program Jennifer has written, a function
which produces a text representing parent/child processes in unix, choices
made by the user, manipulations by the program itself. The function
produces a file, .trace, which, when reversed, is legibile. The .trace
file accumulates, carrying the history of repeated usage; here is an examp

For awhile I thought
"Jeff Harrison" was a pseudonym for Alan Sondheim
so he could post twice as much---
but now it hits me that Alan Sondheim may think
Jeff Hamilton is a pseudonym for someone else
who doesn't like Alan or his cast of nikuku
cuddlies very much....

Poet a Contender to Run Federal Arts Agency
By ROBIN POGREBIN


The poet, critic and anthologist Dana Gioia has emerged as the leading
candidate to become the next chairman of the National Endowment for the
Arts, according to sources close to the process. The previous chairman
of that agency, Michael P. Hammond, died in January after just a week in
the post.

Mr. Gioia's nomination, which must be confirmed by the Senate, is
expected to be announced by President Bush in about two weeks, a
government official said. Because of the endowment's history as a
lightning rod for impassioned debates about the direction of culture in
the country and the government's role in financing it, the chairmanship
is a sensitive post that draws far more attention than other positions
with influence over annual budgets far larger than the endowment's $115
million.

Reached by telephone, Mr. Gioia would confirm only that he was being
considered. "Yes, I have been talking to the White House about this
post," he said. "I can't say anything more than that because it would be
inappropriate at this point. I am not a nominee."

Mr. Gioia (pronounced JOY-a), 51, has published three books of poetry:
"Daily Horoscope" (1986), "The Gods of Winter" (1991) and
"Interrogations at Noon" (2001), which won the American Book Award in
May. He is well known as someone who has revived rhyme and meter, though
he also writes in free verse.

He was widely recognized for his essay "Can Poetry Matter?," which
appeared in The Atlantic in 1991. In the essay, Mr. Gioia argued that a
clubby academic subculture that had grown up around poetry was
preventing it from being widely available to the mainstream. The essay
prompted considerable debate and was included in Mr. Gioia's 1992
collection of essays, "Can Poetry Matter?: Essays on Poetry and American
Culture," which was selected by Publishers Weekly as one of its Best
Books of 1992 and became a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle
award.

Mr. Gioia's poems, translations, essays and reviews have also appeared
in The New Yorker, The Washington Post Book World and The New York Times
Book Review. He is also a longtime commentator on American culture and
literature for BBC Radio, for which he has done programs on Robert Frost
and Shakespeare, among others.

Before becoming a full-time writer in 1992, Mr. Gioia spent 15 years in
the business world, where he became a vice president of General Foods -
now part of Kraft - most of the time in White Plains, N.Y.

Reared in Hawthorne, Calif., an industrial section of Los Angeles
County, Mr. Gioia received a bachelor's degree in English from Stanford
University, where he returned to earn a master's degree in business
administration. He also earned a master's in comparative literature at
Harvard University, where he studied with the poets Robert Fitzgerald
and Elizabeth Bishop.

Mr. Gioia originally intended to be a composer. He is the classical
music critic for San Francisco magazine and wrote the libretto for an
opera, "Nosferatu," with the composer Alva Henderson; the piece is to
have two concert presentations next month in Chattanooga, Tenn.

Mr. Gioia has taught as a visiting writer at Colorado College, Johns
Hopkins University and Wesleyan University, among other institutions. He
is also vice president of the Poetry Society of America. He lives in
Sonoma County in California with his wife, Mary, and two sons, ages 9
and 13.

Even without a permanent chairman, recent organizational changes at the
National Endowment for the Arts have concerned some arts groups and
members of Congress, with memories of "culture wars" battles clearly in
the background.

Eileen C. Mason, the endowment's acting chairwoman, announced that
program directors who oversee the agency's various disciplines, like
literature and folk art, will become subordinate to two directors, one
who was in charge of classical music, the other overseeing museums.

Officials of arts groups that promote programs involving immigrant
culture and other less entrenched art forms worried that the demotion of
those program directors signaled a shift away from some nontraditional
arts toward more mainstream creative areas and might ultimately
influence financing. Ms. Mason insisted that the organizational changes
would not affect the kinds of art that the agency supported.

"There is absolutely no intention to favor one discipline over another,"
she said in an interview.

But members of Congress have asked endowment officials to explain the
reasons for the changes. Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of
New York and chairwoman of the Congressional Arts Caucus, said, "We
asked Eileen Mason to come in." She added, "What we're worried about is
what is going on behind the scenes."

Two former endowment officials said that it was Ann Guthrie Hingston,
the agency's White House and Congressional liaison, who tried in
December to delay approval of a grant for a California production of
"Homebody/Kabul," Tony Kushner's play about a British woman who
disappears in Taliban-era Afghanistan. The grant was ultimately
approved.

Ms. Hingston previously served as a speechwriter for President Ronald
Reagan and a national program director for the Best Friends Foundation,
a privately funded program that encourages abstinence in low-income
girls. Ms. Hingston did not return calls seeking comment.

None of the poets in the ninth circle had eyes. I was
climbing a ladder into descending a staircase,
watching the spokes on the wheel forward it to some
professors in the Library Science Dept. Among the dust
of books, lightly glimmering as if moths had in this
very room shed their resistance to earthliness, I get
a longer spare moment. Asking us to try and reclaim
back our imaginations, our minds, our souls, the
missing of orb-shapes in a blistering white matters
like clots maim when, manic with fissures, I work in a
space here of relative confusion, consuming what could
be light but only (I find just when it's in my mouth,
just before the ultimatum swallows) turns out to be
every page created in an edition of 30 copies by the
contributors and then gathered and bound (every 30
contributors). Jesse, I am interested in this project
being a collective result, though I myself sit here by
myself, selfless and pre-determined. The
dematerialization of contents, as well as the
monitoring of bodies and places;  there is no
distance, only proximity, and sitting near you as I do
too often to jog with memory through Tralfalgar Square
(I enjoyed these four poems quite a bit, and would
like to publish "Orphans" and "The Siege" in the
January issue of a newly sprung year, caught near the
hub of the bicycle where your hand spits damage on the
grain), I really love Basquiat, and dubuffet - in fact
I've been rereading Dubuffet's 'Asphyxiating Culture',
it always cheers me up that someone else distrusted
Institutions like I do.

   Just finished skimming Dana Gioia's essay "CAN POETRY MATTER" (easy 'nuff

Coffee (thanx Ghani) crumb cake and organic pistachio ice cream...


    I can't figure out if i'm right or left....i know i'm not up front
center...the moral tone is appalling...the choice of poets is even worse...the
harkening back to the comforts of the poets of the past is
disheartening...there is a spritz of sense within the maelstrom...

     as some one whose last 2 books had just a few words each in 'em...and
those pretty much indecipherable what can i say...this is not yr mama or

Except, I think, Amazon only counts sales _through Amazon_ as significant
in making its in-house ranking. I imagine this explains most of the
discrepancies you're puzzling over.

Hello Poetics

A few of us poverty-stricken, humble DC writers are doing a reading at
Art-o-matic, this great, somewhat annual warehouse-sized exhibition of the
arts, and the organizers need furniture or a truck from us, go figure. Is
there anything people don't want from the poor?

Does anyone around the DC area want to brave the sniper and the cold to help
out with the worthy cause of helping decorate the room we're going to read
in?

If not, I understand. Your attendance at the reading is more important to us
anyway. In a few days, I'll let you know when the reading is. And the bunch
of us would love to see any DC poetics-list lurkers (like myself) show their
bright shining faces. No snipers, please.

I'm on digest, so a bit slow to respond.  Definitely the beer helps. I
don't have more than superficial impressions, but I can give a few guesses
at the current atmosphere. The city of the festival, Olomouc, is centrally
located in the country, so the Soviets chose it to be the central garrison,
for quick access to any part of the country. Until 1989 they had 45,000
Russian troops stationed there, with all the trucks, tanks, ammo dumps. All
publication was controlled and censored. No photocopy machines, no mimeos
permitted. My friend Petr Mikes was one of the samizdat publishers, and
when I went to his house he showed me three of the original books--most he
has given to an archive in Prague. The process was to type with thin paper
and 7 or 8 carbons, then to place the loose sheets in a folder of
construction paper, frequently with a hand-colored design on the cover.
These copies would be circulated, and the recipient would make a further 7
or 8 copies to circulate. If you got caught, you got beat up or jailed for
awhile. When such conditions change, enthusiasm blossoms. It's not just
that city, of course, though there is a 14,000 student university there.
Don't forget Vaclav Havel, a writer, is president of the country, which
shows a broader cultural base than academe. Sylvester

Heaney, Horace, Thunders, Applause


The tepid flavor of Hangers-on and starfuckers

Farts across 1,000 pews too Distant
         to Properly             suck up,

Me bowling for pussy and not Psalms
                                      to bask in each

Unapologetic solipsism, degree of sycophancy

Rather than be Seen, fade to corners
                         unclamored by Trick hellos

but Rock in anticipating mystification

As methinks the elevator Peters amid Latin

To have Settled inside this Bastard calling
                                  relying on insufferables
                                   to further anoint

Three ring chapel, there's no shame Along
                     aisles of unstoppable Genuflections

No unguarded Release to seminate

Yours truly skips mention of his own
                             Foul scent, a bitter
                             hovering Salt

               which licks to Wounds
               slight as His

Unappeasably sent Past brogue ears that
                                        oughtta be hotter

Beyond itself, poems get Further
                        than intended

Out from under loved Ones and Fated

to get spoiled in hokiest Introductions
by the well-meaning     Meanest

The Tomato Cans of Covet


Glom on tight to rising Counterparts

Slip into your k Hole to find regrettable
                               Dental coverage

Even with the perkosets I am less
               Katie Couric and more Captain
                                     Kangaroo

Maybe I'm amazed you're still around
                            Except much worse

exit thru Spinning mouths toward
impromptu furniture redesignations

That neither soothe nor meet Specs

All the while open Mikes get canceled
                           until perpetrators get
                                  Identities

Patriots, must we be so precious, At
                     gala receptions with barbeque
                                    forks

Find me and bring about Double digit reforms
             that swelter and Care

Your buzz at breakout comes as a Shock

Ambitions hateful as hornets, To stomp

The countryside until the subways Visit

In the trusty hearts of Robots, shit is going
                                  down and Records
                                  make comebacks

What's missing in our manic Trances is a
                            little understanding

for Palookas, who toil past the Bell
              to feast on     Left hooks

Subject:      Re: politically conservative poets

I think you need to define what you have in mind as "conservative." Certainly
in UK there are poets like Geoffrey Hill that are well-known for their
Tory-like views. In US, "conservatism" among poets is really of the
individualist/libertarian strain. I was took poets like Ted Enslinn, Bob
Arnold, William Bronk,Clark Coolidge and Ed Foster coming from that New
Englandly Transcendentalist Individualism. Ed Foster's decison to "avoid the
authorities"(kerouac) and not accept government monies or grants stems from
his political beliefs.

Reaganite poets? Don't know, but I do remember Allen Ginsberg getting into a
snit over William Jay Smith because the latter said he would never do anything
to embarrass his country --but does that make him a rightwinger?

Conversely, the only admitted communnist (small 'c') poet in the US is Amiri
Baraka.

When I was researching Walter Lowenfels for his selected poems I edited, his
CP party was a part of his archive at the Beinecke Library at Yale.

THE ONTOLOGICAL THEATRE ON EGG, THE ARTS SHOW


   On Friday, October 25th, EGG the Arts Show, will feature a segment on
Richard Foreman and the Ontological-Hysteric Theatre. The program is dealing
with the "mysteries of life explained" and will feature scenes from the
rehearsal process for last year's Maria Del Bosco. Not only will this be a
treat for those of you who have followed Richard's work for years, it should
also be a wonderful introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the
Ontological Theatre. So tell your friends and tune in!

   EGG airs on Friday, October 25th at 10:00 pm with an encore presentation
Saturday the 26th at 12:30 am.

   For more information visit http://www.pbs.org/wnet/egg/.

Yeah, I am also of a mind to say happy birthday, Brom. As a birthday

That explains a difference of ~a million~ in the
rankings between Nada Gordon's two books, published
within months of each other?!  etc., etc.


You might want to look at something like Judith
Chevalier's "Measuring Prices and Price Competition
Online: Amazon and Barnes and Noble", at

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=319701
.


Everyone knows that Amazon counts only their own sales
(duh).  The point about the 500 copies was precisely
that: that rankings, as such, cannot be extrapolated
into ~either~ being representative of total sales
elsewhere or ~within Amazon~ (see below).  The more
significant (or interesting) discrepancy around the
500 copies is not so much the 250,000 ranking
difference, but that the rankings are ~inverse~ to
their sales as reported elsewhere.  That is, *books
with smaller total sales are showing up as higher
Amazon rankings* than books with greater total sales.

(If Amazon reflected "the real world," Graham =
65,971/8,500 (ranking/total sales), Poetry Like Bread
= 310,638/9,000 and Any Rough Time = 190,379/5,000,
from higher to lower, should yield

Like Bread
Graham
Any Rough

but it yields

Like Bread
Any Rough
Graham !       :)                       {whoopee!})

http://www.antiqnet.com/cgi-bin/texis/scripts/mainsearch/auxdetail.html?num=3&did=3d11f8a1e

[ERRATUM on previous e-mail: for "Paul McCartney's
~Blackbird Singing~ . . . was estimated to have sold
approximately *3,750* copies in its first year", read:
"was estimated to have sold approximately 3,750 copies
in its first ~month"~ (or 45,000 in its first year).

. . . which renders absurd any implication like the
first six titles' in the original list, that Ashbery
(6,670) somehow creams Paul McCartney (7,627) or Jewel
(7,481), in Amazonia!]

Also: the Law of Big Numbers (Big Numbahs) would have
it that, even where there are a couple of million
titles, where there are ~hundreds~ of millions of
purchases those purchases will not distribute
themselves ordinally without gaps so that there's a
one-for-one match between rankings and sales, but
there must be *different rankings which have the same
number of sales.*  And the compression becomes greater
down toward the smaller numbers of sales and lower
rankings where the poetry titles abound.  ---That is,
with poetry books, which might sell only two or three,
five or six copies on-line, there is not only ~one~
sale of two copies or one of six, but there would be
several for each.  And, within sales of the same
amount, the titles would still have to be
differentiated, so that "several different factors"
would include something as simple as assigning a
unique number (ranking) to each title.  Otherwise,
there could be more than one # 1 Best Seller. But
then, there is a further disconnect between sales
rankings and even *Amazon* sales, and you cannot
accurately tell how far apart any sales ranking is
from one that follows after it.

Perhaps this little not.art web site that I put up
last winter---

http://jeffersonpythagoras.da.ru/

---would help further elucidate (best viewed in
Netscape Navigator.  Internet Explorer doesn't show
the blinking serial numbers).

Dear Poetics,

Recently, a Stanford Faculty Against the War committee was formed, and the
other day the student newspaper reported on it.  After quoting famed
biologist Paul Ehrlich that the war "is one of the stupidest ideas our
government has come up with in my lifetime," the article in The Stanford
Daily goes on:

"No Stanford professors that The Daily contacted expressed support for any
sort of action in Iraq, and most of those contacted could not name a
faculty member who did.

"Such lack of vocal support for a preemptive strike against Iraq is
particularly striking given that Bush's pro-war National Security Advisor,
Condoleeza Rice was selected directly from the ranks of the University's
faculty."

Ah, Honor Restored.  After all the talk about poets who work in "the
academy," I just wanted to share this with everyone.

I'm Academic and I'm Proud
Say It Loud

We Aint So Stupid as to Attack
There Are Other Ways to Disarm Iraq
        (and Israel and Texas and . . .)

Just Cause We Got One Megalomaniac
Don't Mean We All Smoke Crack

I'm Academic and I'm Proud
Say It Loud

ZECHARIAH ii


Now what is of interest here, among us, is that I did not place Zechariah
on the hard drive, nor have I read Zechariah recently; it is either the
semblance of a hack, or the semblance of an originary distribution within
WinXP home. Look to your own hard drives, check at sector 1016 and higher,
search for Zechariah. Perhaps it is the beginning of the end, o Jerusalem,
of which I have had suspicion; perhaps it is an annotation from the relig-
ious among us.

Of the materials, of the rest which I have placed there, emergent and
fragmented, nothing standing out at 666.

I want to suggest a new book, The Black Rock Desert, Text by William L. Fox
and Photographs by Mark Klett (U of Arizona Press, 77 pages, $13.95). The
Desert in question (in view) North of Reno and Pyramid Lake, 3 to 4K feet
above sea level, a 400 square mile playa, "one of the largest unimpeded flat
spaces in America", (a tiny portion of which is the annual home of Burning
Man Festival). A place where nothing lives and any mark is erased by rain or
wind. Absent of metaphor, absent of geological shapes, vegetation, or human
habitat, the search to occasion a language and/or photographic image are put
to the severest test. Klett's photographs and Fox's language - working with
the barest of means - stake a close and revelatory contest. I find it an
extraordinary rendering of legibility in the context of what must be one
this continent's closest examples of sheer absence:
"Formed by the abrupt boundary between air masses of two temperatures,
mirages are frequent on the playa, where the air immediately above the
ground is much hotter than just a few inches higher. The subsequent
discontinuity causes light to bend, or refract, the most common effect being
to reflect back the sky, an illusion that today was a blue line that
thickened until it resembled a vast lake in front of us that stretched
across the entire width of the playa. This was the kind of mirage Bruff
wrote about, livestock crazed with thirst stampeding themselves to death for
an optical apparition."

Reading this book and getting immersed in its challenge to cope with such
vastness brought up the lineage of sculptors (Robert Smithson, Walter
Demaria, Michael Heizer and James Turrell) who - in a related manner -  have
also worked the Great Basin and sought to find a physical legibility in
spaces that otherwise appear to mock (or certainly contest) the concept of
human presence.

In a way I see this little volume - and related photography by Klett and
writing by Fox -  as an extension of the work of those sculptors of the
land.

In relation to poetry - indeed the seventies and eighties attraction of many
us to the works of Smithson and Demaria in particular (as well as a
coincidental attraction to Barthes' Writing Degree Zero) it makes me want to
ask if anyone has written critically about the influence of land artists and
their  impact on concepts of space (the page as bare landscape - if that is
the connection) and the activity of writing  (??).

Take a look at today's NY Times (and probably other papers) about how
Rumsfeld/Wolfowitz have set up their own intelligence unit because they are
dissatisfied with the work of the CIA and others in linking Iraq to al
Qaeda: they are not getting the results they want to monger their
war.  Wolfowitz said that there is "a phenomenon in intelligence work, that
people who are pursuing a certain hypothesis will see certain facts that
others won't, and not see other fact that others will.  The lens through
which you're looking for facts affects what you look for."  As Mark Twain
said, "There are lies, damned lies, and there are statistics."  I am
waiting for Bennet and Himmelfarb and others to criticize Wolfowitz for
being an academic nihilist.  Bertolt Brecht pointed out that in times of
fascism simply telling the truth in your own field, whether as a shoemaker
or as a biologist (or as a poet), is an act of resistance.

In the present anti-fascist front even parts of the CIA and Joint Chiefs of
Staff know the difference between fabrication and reality.  And even the
vast bulk of the intellectual community -- not to mention the American public.

You bet I'm proud.

***Apologies in advance for cross-posting***

24 October 2002

The Banner Art Collective (http://bannerart.org) has implemented a new
design created by Garrett Lynch.  The new design brings a vast number of
improvements to the site, which collects and distributes net.art and poet=
ry
created according to the limitations of WWW advertising.

The collection is now database driven and easily searchable.  Each work i=
s
presented on a separate page, and more artist information is featured nex=
t
to each work.  Viewers have always been able to access cut-and-paste html
tags to place works from the collection on their own webpages, but now th=
e
site also offers users a php-driven script that, when added to any html
document, serves randomly changing banners from the collection.

In addition, the new design automates the submission process with an onli=
ne
form which artists can use to easily upload their works to the collection.
There are also new frequently updated sections which contain news, links =
to
host and sponsor sites, and links to related research and art projects.

Best,
Brandon Barr & Garrett Lynch

I may be just having a bemusing day but can't stop musing over the meaning
of 'innovative poetry'.  From a practitioner's perspective it's hard to
imagine poetry that's not innovative?

If William Jay Smith promised he'd never do anything to embarrass his
country, why did he accept the LOC Poet Consultantship?

Tom,

I believe you are not reading how Loss interprets the term "Innovative" in
regards to poetry. He is not meaning what you and I first see as avant garde
poetry reaching for a new height, but innovative in means of production and
delivery. Please read his book and it will become clear what he means is
different that what you first, correctly, percieve. Once past this his
studies open up to new methods of production in electronic forms.

Best, Geoffrey

EDITOR=92S NOTE

Breathing Another New Joyous Oration.  Kyle Conner asked if BANJO was an=20
acronym.  I said no, and he said he had the perfect words to make it one.
    The name came to me with less thought than feeling, which is another way=
=20
of saying why and how are not easy.  The original idea of BANJO is very=20
different from what you have in your hands today.  I=92ve always wanted to w=
ork=20
with the interview, but not in the traditional format.  Years ago I picked u=
p=20
Magical Blend Magazine where the pop star Donovan was interviewed.  It was=20
then that I began reading only the questions, answering them for myself.  Yo=
u=20
can always go back to read the answers if you need to.  Questions are always=
=20
valid, when you think on it.  Answers are subjective, no matter what the=20
answer.  There=92s more than one way to anything, even my answer that answer=
s=20
are subjective.  Besides, it=92s fun answering those interview questions in=20=
the=20
magazines, no matter what they ask.  =93What was it like growing up on the=20
Yukon?=94  Ooops, true, I didn=92t grow up on the Yukon, but I like the idea=
 of=20
answering it anyway, and maybe you do too.
    So I wanted a magazine where a pair of poets are involved with the=20
interview process, but the one rule would be that no one may answer.  A roux=
=20
of questions for the readers.  The possibilities seemed endless.  Then=20
suddenly it seemed entirely too narrow.  When I invited Kyle Conner to set=20
the tone of issue #1 with me, he helped vere the project towards a=20
conversation, and suddenly it was colorful and exciting again.  Yes!  That=
=92s=20
it!  We=92ll have a talk!  It took the rug of formality from beneath us, and=
=20
feelings and ideas were suddenly freed in the process.  I=92m very glad I=20
involved Kyle with issue #1, and I=92m glad I=92m someone who learned quite=20=
a=20
long time ago the importance of synergy and its many benefits.  Working with=
=20
someone often seems our highest purpose down here, or up here, depending on=20
your vantage.  It was then that I decided to invite a different visual artis=
t=20
to design a cover with each issue.  At first I felt a plain cover, something=
=20
stark.  When I asked my friend Michelle Strader to do issue #1=92s cover she=
=20
instantly said she wanted to do a Buddhist monastery, and that felt=20
auspicious, her not even needing to think on it.
    Welcome to issue #1.  Feel free to comment or question by using either=20

*************

CAConrad:  I=92ve always been fascinated by poets who are anonymous.  I=92m=20
thinking about that poem you wrote on the South Street Bridge, and then=20
didn=92t sign it.  There=92s something amazing about that.  You really let g=
o of=20
the work.  How many of us are brave enough to do that?  I can=92t imagine=20
writing a poem and NOT putting my name on it.

Kyle Conner:  Well it kind of called for it in that situation.  That was a=20
poem for that bridge, and for Philadelphia.  I felt fantastic that it was=20
used in a documentary, which showed me that it was useful.  I wanted to do i=
t=20
again--this public kind of poetry--but I never found another opportunity. =20
And maybe I=92ve grown out of it too.

CA: Where did you get your first jolt for poetry? =20

KC: Ooooo, that=92s difficult.  I think there=92s two points of reference. =20=
One=20
is when you start doing it, and the other is when you realize you need to do=
=20
it.  And I started doing it in high school.  The fascination began with=20
reading plays.  The first writing I really did was writing monologues.  I di=
d=20
a little poetry, but it was mostly monologues.  And I continued to write, an=
d=20
I went to New York.  But when I came back to Philadelphia to go to Temple=20
[University], I started writing poetry as a way to uplift myself.  I would=20
get this incredible inspirational feeling.  Then that street scene started i=
n=20
Philly, oh, around 93-95, which fed my inspiration, and that=92s when I firs=
t=20
felt =93I need to do this.=94

CA: Street scene?  What do you mean by street scene?

KC: When you were doing the North Star Bar Reading Series, and Scott Kramer=20
was doing the Last Drop Reading Series.  That felt vital.  My poetry=92s=20
changed, and my need to do poetry is different now.  But that time, that=92s=
=20
what really fueled me to do it.  And reading it in public was a real=20
connection to my inner emotions.  Getting it out in that way, because I was=20=
a=20
much more orally directed poet back then.  That=92s when Spoken Word was=20
getting credibility.

CA: Were there any poets in particular you were reading at the time who also=
=20
did this for you?

KC: At that time it was probably Ferlinghetti and Ginsberg.  I had read=20
Reality Sandwiches.  That=92s the one where Ginsberg speaks constant poetry=20=
as=20
he=92s driving across the country, and I thought that was incredible, to ope=
n=20
the doorway, and let whatever he was seeing come in.  The tape recorder was=20
on the whole time, you can read it in the writing.  He=92s hearing reports=20
about the Vietnam War and he=92s speaking right into the tape recorder.  So=20=
it=20
was Ginsberg I was reading, and Kerouac.  Back in high school it was=20
e.e.cummings and Anne Sexton, but that was before I discovered the Beats.

CA: For poets our age, by the time we were in high school the Beats were=20
already a big part of pop culture, and you could easily get your hands on=20
them.  What was difficult for me was getting my hands on anything else in my=
=20
little backwater, redneck country town.  Kafka was my first love, and the=20
only prose writer I can really say ever inspired me to write.  As far as=20
poetry, the library had a shelf or two of the usual crap, poets who=20
discourage and bore more than they excite.  It was the Beats who gave me my=20
first jolt!  Ginsberg and Corso were great, but it was Bob Kaufman, Diane Di=
=20
Prima and Philip Lamantia who really filled me, though Kaufman the most.  Bo=
b=20
Kaufman was more delicious than sex, and that=92s saying something for a 16=20
year old!  THEN some amazing soul in my school invited the poet Molly=20
Russakoff to give a reading.  She was the first poet I ever met.  I can stil=
l=20
remember that reading, more than any other poetry reading!  She read this=20
amazing poem called =93The Essential Molly Russakoff=94 where she lists the=20=
items=20
in her purse, and poems about her boyfriend Rat Lip who was working on the=20
black market selling stolen meat.  And then this gorgeous little poem=20
published in The Paris Review.  I shuffled up to her afterwards,=20
pathologically shy, but I NEEDED to ask her WHO I should be reading!  She=20
said, without hesitation, I should be reading Alice Notley and Ron Padgett.=20
To this day I don=92t remember if she also said Joseph Ceravolo, or if I fou=
nd=20
him through reading the others.  No one I knew at the time had ever heard of=
=20
these poets.  And when the library ordered these books for me I was never th=
e=20
same again.  Every part of me seemed to lift in response to their words,=20
especially Notley=92s.  I walked different, things tasted different.  I had=20=
a=20
boyfriend during this upheaval, I remember how the ignition of poetry made=20
sex bring me to tears while in this state of euphoria I can=92t explain.  It=
=20
was a brand of joy he didn=92t appreciate, I think it freaked him out.  He=20
thought I was insane, oh well, I don=92t know.

KC: I think we=92ve all had some kind of quintessential experience which tur=
ned=20
us on to poetry.  But I love that you had that with Molly, who is somebody w=
e=20
know--

CA: --and it=92s hard to get better than Molly!  She=92s a compelling reader=
.  It=20
was mind blowing for a teenager.  I feel that=92s when I really woke up!  I=20
always knew I wanted to write poetry, and really devote myself to it, but it=
=20
wasn=92t until Molly Russakoff=92s reading, and getting those books she=20
suggested, that I really felt awake for the first time in my life!  I still=20
feel there, completely in that energy!  A few years later I moved to=20
Philadelphia where I met the poet Jim Cory who introduced me to a wealth of=20
books I hadn=92t even imagined.  I feel very fortunate to have met these peo=
ple.

KC: I want to return to that idea of the Beats, and how they were so=20
important.  We take that for granted, that the Beats were influential on us,=
=20
but it just strikes me as interesting that at some point they won=92t be wha=
t=92s=20
new anymore.  And really what was happening concurrently with that scene was=
=20
the New York School.  But because of the way mass media works, and because o=
f=20
that special savvy Ginsberg has, the Beats were more available, and that=92s=
=20
what we were reading.  Meanwhile there was Berrigan and Ed Sanders.

CA: More than anything I want to win the fucking lottery so I can stock ever=
y=20
small town library in America with books by Mina Loy, Lorine Niedecker,=20
Jonathan Williams, Eileen Myles and others.  I guarantee you they WILL be=20
read!  They WILL alter youth!  But maybe it=92s unnecessary, now that we hav=
e=20
the internet.  I LOVE the internet!  I like to think of kids in my small tow=
n=20
where the roads are as dusty as the books, tapping into websites like The=20
Poetry Project or SUNY.  It=92s an amazing thing, the internet.

KC: Yeah, it=92s completely changed the landscape, and I think it=92s great=20=
that=20
small town communities won=92t have to be in the dark anymore.  It=92s great=
 with=20
all the online magazines, and who knows what will happen with that.

CA: It=92s an exciting time for poetry.  I wouldn=92t trade this time period=
 with=20
any other.  There are so many different kinds of poetry going on, and I don=
=92t=20
appreciate all of it, but I appreciate that it=92s all there.

KC: That kind of feeds into this one idea I have.  Part of me agrees, but I=20
feel LANGUAGE poetry has brought us to this place from which we can=92t turn=
=20
back.  I feel they=92ve stripped away the beauty from the language.  They=20
really wanted to rip the language open and find the truth in it.  They were=20
suspicious of it, and they were angry with it because of what was happening=20
with the [Vietnam] War.  So I feel it=92s brought us to this place where all=
=20
the limbs have been ripped off the statues.  I=92m not writing now, currentl=
y,=20
and that=92s why I=92m looking to comics to fill my artistic needs.  I don=
=92t=20
know, I just feel kind of depressed about it.

CA: You were writing poetry very recently though.  Those AMAZING things you=20
were leaving on my answering machine!

KC: Thank you.

CA: It=92s not as though you=92ve STOPPED writing, you=92re just in the quie=
t part=20
of the cycle now, that=92s all.

KC: That could be it.  But also I look at a lot of poetry, and it seems to=20
reflect itself, and the poets reflect each other.  And a lot of it is caught=
=20
in New York.  And it all seems to reflect these feelings of vagueness,=20
indifference, turmoil, confusion, and it=92s not beautiful, and that saddens=
 me=20
because I think language can be beautiful, and can sing, and can uplift.

CA: Okay, let=92s get back to how ugly LANGUAGE poetry is.  You don=92t thin=
k=20
Lynn Hejinian=92s poetry is beautiful?  I think her writing is fucking gorge=
ous!

KC: Maybe it=92s beautiful, but in an unsettling way.  Because that=92s what=
 it=20
does, that=92s what it=92s designed to do is unsettle.  Maybe I=92m just loo=
king=20
back to poets like Shakespeare.  Things were more stable then, and people=20
were more confident with their understanding of the world, and you can see=20
that in their art, and in their poetry, and in their music.  It=92s so order=
ed,=20
and so self-servingly beautiful.  You listen to Bach, and it=92s just perfec=
t,=20
it completely serves itself, and it moves in a circle and it comes back=20
around.  If you listen to contemporary Jazz, it=92s real interesting because=
 it=20
seems to parallel contemporary poetry.  For instance I read a poem by Anselm=
=20
Berrigan, and I listen to a new Branford Marsallis song.  The Branford=20
Marsallis tune meanders, and it makes these statements which are designed to=
=20
question, but there=92s no answer given.  Anselm Berrigan=92s poems move aro=
und=20
the page in a very haphazard way, and it=92s beautiful, but I find it=20
frightening, and in a way saddening, not that that=92s a bad thing.  It seem=
s=20
to speak of a larger situation in the world of the Information Age, and=20
peoples=92 anxieties about what=92s happening, and the greater and greater=20
awareness of what=92s happening to the environment.

CA: Maybe it=92s all anxious questions because we=92re understanding that it=
=92s=20
the so-called answers men have had for centuries which have brought us to=20
this dark age.  These are the very things that I think make it all very=20
exciting, this call and response with the world poets are creating.

KC: Maybe it=92s not possible at this moment in time to be beautiful.  Maybe=
 we=20
can=92t have pure beauty anymore.

CA: Well now look at the Blues.  The Blues are definitely not a picnic, but=20
they=92re beautiful.  Billie Holiday is sad and lovely.  There=92s something=
=20
about the way the message comes across.  It=92s very Buddhist, that idea of=20
walking joyfully with suffering.  And I look at poets like Philip Whalen, wh=
o=20
doesn=92t get nearly enough credit for how much influence he=92s had on poet=
ry,=20
and he really embodies that idea of walking joyfully with suffering.

KC: Maybe beauty is a subjective term.  Maybe it=92s not worthwhile to use t=
hat=20
term.

CA: I=92m glad you=92re talking about beauty, because I=92m having this thin=
g about=20
color.  It=92s a pretty recent thing, this rendezvous with color.  It=92s an=
=20
awareness of color as provocative, spiteful, joyous, argumentative, daring,=20
seductive, even morbid echoes from every verb we flavor our world with. =20
Color as life forms in our midst, a separate intelligence.  I had this=20
breakthrough dream a couple weeks ago with Blue.  It was talking to me, yeah=
,=20
a Blue shirt, but it wasn=92t the shirt that was talking, it was the Blue. =20
There was a fuzziness, a blurry vibration where it=92s mouth was that would=20
disappear when it was quiet.  And the voice was my own voice.  And I didn=
=92t=20
feel ignored by the other colors, maybe it was really me ignoring them.  Blu=
e=20
said it needed to tell me something, but then said nothing, like it was=20
really something I needed to find out on my own.  I woke DAZZLED, feeling=20
color is this secret breathing world around us.  I mean, you think you have=20
five Blue sweaters, but you don=92t have five Blue sweaters, you have five=20
sweaters, and you also have five Blues.  Color communicates as direct as a=20
bird singing.

KC: A month ago I was at the Art Museum, and I was staring at this yellow=20
flower, and it was a sunny day.  I was thinking that color is light, and the=
=20
color we see is what is reflected off an object.  So the shirt is absorbing=20
all colors of light, except this one color, and that=92s the one that=92s=20
bouncing off, and that=92s the one you see.  So, it is living, because it=
=92s=20
light.  Can you use it?  Do you think you can use it somehow?

CA: What do you mean use it?

KC: For your poetry.

CA: I=92m sure it will pop up eventually, but I=92m not one to be so deliber=
ate. =20
I know poets who are deliberate, but for me it comes out when it comes out,=20
and I feel much of that is due to my undisciplined education--

KC: --unconventional.

CA: Unconventional.  My education in poetry has always been this intuitive,=20
obsessive process of exploring every bookstore and library and picking up=20
things and reading.  And in the process internalizing very many very useful=20
tools along the way.  That=92s why I find it difficult sometimes to talk to=20
poets who have a rather vigorous background, especially those from the MFA=20
writing programs, where they can name all the tools.  I feel like a piano=20
player who never learned to read music, but I can play the music.

KC: That=92s what=92s amazing about art, because everybody does it the way t=
hat=20
they have to, and the poetry we write is an extension of who we are.  The=20
poetry and the art is going to be just as unique and curious as the person.

CA: It makes me sad when I hear people say it=92s something they could do=20
easier when they were children.  They=92re confessing they=92ve lost somethi=
ng.

KC: Hmm, I think it=92s easier NOW!

CA: Yeah, I find it much easier now.  My childhood was all about guilt. =20
Which is one of those touchy subjects I was going to bring up.  Do you think=
=20
children draw us pictures because they feel guilty they can=92t pay the rent=
?

KC: I love that question!  I think I drew pictures to release aggression.  I=
=20
remember me and my brother got news roll from a newspaper company, I don=92t=
=20
know how we got it.  We=92d roll out a sheet and draw a huge war scene.  It=20=
was=20
live action art, because we were creating the art and acting it out.  But wh=
y=20
do you ask that question?  Did you draw pictures as a kid?

CA: Yeah, and I did it because I felt guilty I couldn=92t pay the rent.

KC: That=92s amazing you were so sophisticated.

CA: I don=92t think of guilt as very sophisticated.  It=92s useless is what=20=
it is.

KC: No, but, that you were guilty you couldn=92t pay the rent.

CA: Well we were poor.  I saw how hard my mother had to work.

KC: So you thought she could sell your pictures?

CA: No, it was currency itself, or something.  I don=92t really know anymore=
.

KC: That=92s interesting.  Hm.  I guess the thing I want to maintain from=20
childhood is wonder.  The first person I heard talk about that was David=20
Baratier, who is this amazing, dynamic poetry force.  He edits Pavement Saw,=
=20
and every year he seems to have another contest under his umbrella.  But he=20
used to talk about wonder, and how important it was for poets to engage in=20
wonder.  A couple years later I came to a similar conclusion under my own=20
conditions.  But it also has to do with busting up assumptions which I got i=
n=20
tune with doing the Highwire Reading Series.  I did not want it to be a=20
boring reading series, and that=92s why Greg [Fuchs] and I decided to write=20
those introductions, which were not going to be biographical, ass-wiping=20
introductions where you just list accomplishments.  We just wanted to have=20
fun and catch everyone off guard.  And then you e-mailed me the other day,=20
and you have this new quote in your sign-off, and it=92s from the Situationi=
st=20
guy [Raoul Vaneigem], and he uses the word =93scandalous,=94 and I immediate=
ly=20
thought =93YEAH!=94  He was talking about public actions, but I applied it=20
specifically to poetry.  The way the world is now we=92ve GOT to be scandalo=
us=20
with our poetry, we=92ve got to be angry with it, we=92ve got to deploy it i=
n=20
scandalous ways, in disruptive ways.  The Highwire Reading Series was a=20
motion towards that.  More and more I=92ve thought I need to live my life th=
at=20
way, to feed my irrationality and my wonder, because those are the things=20
that get suffocated by a capitalist society.  You have to keep feeding=20
wonder, and continue to question, otherwise TV will tell you everything you=20
need to know, with it=92s advertisements fucking you up the ass.  And the=20
politicians get to look good on the news.  I mean, how dare they tell me tha=
t=20
a missile defense system is a good thing!

CA: It=92s all lies.  I=92ve been working in retail for a number of years no=
w. =20
It=92s one of the ways I=92ve tried to survive in this country, to find the=20=
job=20
with the least psychic impact, to keep me free to read and write.  But let m=
e=20
tell you, it=92s a joke.  There=92s nothing in this system which has low psy=
chic=20
impact.  And retail really makes a liar out of you.  You=92re a fucking liar=
=20
all day long.  If I want to keep my job I can=92t tell a rude customer to fu=
ck=20
himself.  I=92ve worked retail in Rittenhouse Square with all those fascist=20
rich motherfuckers!  I should be given a fucking medal for not hurting three=
=20
or four of them!

KC: Yeah, and the sad thing is you wind up lying to yourself.  80% of the=20
population might think they have what they need, but they=92ve been swindled=
. =20
80% of the population needs therapy.  I feel really angry about this.  And I=
=20
think art is a way to subvert the system.  And there=92s so much more to do.

CA: But at the same time I can=92t help thinking how marvelous things are to=
o! =20
We have telephones and airplanes and buses.  If we were alive 2,000 years=20
ago, we=92d be stuck in the same damn village with the same goddamm dozen=20
people our whole lives!  I mean, I=92m 35 years old and feel like I=92ve liv=
ed 10=20
lifetimes when I start to think about all the circles and cycles of people=20
who have been part of my life.  My life experiences have been formed in the=20
belly of capitalism like other Americans.  Weighing it though, its oppressio=
n=20
is greater than its good.

KC: You and I though, I think we=92ve achieved this vantage of wonder.  I do=
n=92t=20
feel arrogant about it, I=92ve worked hard.  I=92m an artist, but I=92ve bee=
n in=20
therapy, I=92m doing work on myself physically and emotionally, and it=92s a=
 long=20
hard road.  I agree it=92s a gray world, there are beautiful things about it=
,=20
and there are hideous things about it.  And sometimes they go hand in hand.

CA: I feel grateful to have poetry in my life.  I was trying to bring this u=
p=20
at a party I was at.  And I guess I got on the wrong road with this when I=20
said, =93I wish everyone was a poet.=94  Boy did I get a whipping for that.=20=
 But=20
what I really mean is, I wish everyone could get a hold of their creative=20
force, and since the center of my universe is poetry, it=92s the first thing=
=20
that comes to mind.  I think creativity is the one sure thing that everyone=20
wants.  People have come up to me after a poetry reading to say =93I wish I=20
could do that.=94  So I always say to them that they should start reading=20
poetry.  If anything will get you to write poetry it=92s reading poetry.  Th=
at=20
magical track you set yourself into, or rather, give yourself to.  I=92ve ev=
en=20
had poets tell me that they don=92t want to read poetry because it will=20
interfere with their process, or some such crap.  I just think it=92s=20
ridiculous that there=92s that much selfishness that one would completely=20
ignore poetry so that one could write it.  As soon as someone tells me=20
this--and it=92s more common than I realized--I just slip away from the=20
conversation.  I can=92t imagine talking to a poet who isn=92t interested in=
=20
discovering poetry.

KC: I think there=92s poetry in everything.  Sometimes I go into an intense=20
film phase, or like now I=92m checking out comics because I get to a full po=
int=20
with poetry and can=92t read anymore for awhile.  I don=92t think I won=92t=20=
go back=20
to it, it=92s just a matter of resting up.

CA: Getting back to this idea I was trying to get across at the party.  The=20
elitism in the art world is extraordinary.  There are times I overhear=20
certain artists talking and it sounds like they don=92t want anyone else to=20=
try=20
what they=92re doing.  It=92s almost as if we need to make art which confron=
ts=20
the art world.  Like a job interview I had to be a union organizer, and the=20
interviewer said =93We=92re looking for DEDICATED workers who will work 60-7=
0=20
hours a week for the union!=94  And I said, =93Whoa!  Sounds like you need a=
=20
union for your union workers!=94  But where art is most elitist is when art=20
becomes commodity.  And the compromises in that are problems for the artist=20
as much as for the buyer.  I look at cultures like Bali, where the word=20
=93artist=94 doesn=92t exist in the vocabulary!  How amazing is that!?  But=20=
if you=20
look at how people in Bali live, everything=92s beautiful, everything, becau=
se=20
everyone is making art, making their world beautiful together.  They don=92t=
=20
need a word like =93artist=94 because everyone already is one.  They don=92t=
=20
separate one another in that most horrible of ways.  To them art is part of=20
being a human being!

KC: These are worlds which are still involved with ritual.  If you listen to=
=20
a field recording of African drummers, it is their art, but it=92s not separ=
ate=20
from their ritual, and that=92s what makes it beautiful.  But in a capitalis=
t=20
society, certain artists have decided to survive by selling their art, but=20
then they also start to sell away their inspiration, their purity, you know.=
 =20
They=92re selling away the personal usefulness for the art, because they=92r=
e=20
trying to figure out =93Who might want this?=94  And they=92re growing furth=
er and=20
further away from the organic nature of the art.

CA: Capitalism keeps winning new territory.

KC: That=92s kind of like that discussion we had with Frank Sherlock at one=20=
of=20
the poetry readings.  And it was really a good discussion for me because at=20
first I was just playing devil=92s advocate.  You and Frank were talking abo=
ut=20
how we need to resist globalization, it was around the time of the big WTO=20
conference in Canada.  And I said, =93What if we just let globalization occu=
r,=20
wouldn=92t it kind of burn itself out because soon there would be no more=20
markets?=94  He and you started talking about all these things that are=20
happening now, and then I thought maybe there will never be a dearth of=20
markets, because new generations will constantly be born.  And for me, that=20
was the first time I realized we really do need to fight against=20
globalization.  So, I thought that was valuable.  And maybe there is a way t=
o=20
win.

CA: Well I feel creativity is the way.  When I look at ALL the art students=20
today I get so excited!  There=92s never been another time in western histor=
y=20
where there have been this many art students!  And I=92m excited about that=20
because you can=92t have change without creativity!  And there=92s NO WAY th=
ey=92re=20
ALL going to fit into that narrow market for art!  The ones who are lucky or=
=20
unlucky--I say lucky--to not get into that market, those are the ones who ar=
e=20
going to have to DO something with their art with the rest of us together. =20
There=92s going to be some amazing community building in the near future, I=20
feel it!  Hopefully everyone=92s not going to just put art behind us and wor=
k 9=20
to 5 everyday.  We=92re living in an explosive time period for human=20
development!

KC: That=92s cool!  There are so many artists.  And it=92s happening already=
,=20
there=92s just an overflow of art, there=92s just too much!  But a lot of it=
=20
scares me, which is good too!  A couple of things seem to be getting big,=20
manga, which is Japanese influenced cartooning.  Video art, graffiti,=20
pornography is changing--

CA: --pornography is changing?

KC: Yeah.

CA: You would think I would know, considering where I work.

KC: I read about this porno that=92s being filmed at Harvard.  And it=92s an=
=20
avant guard critique of pornography, and it=92s called The Staxxx.  The stac=
ks=20
is what they call a specific place in their library, and it=92s this=20
mythological place where all the students have sex.  The professors were=20
being interviewed and they thought it was great, saying, =93We teach them to=
=20
critique text, and pornography is a text, so....=94  And now they=92re makin=
g a=20
porno, and I think it=92s great!  It=92s got lesbians in it, it=92s cool.  B=
ut my=20
point is, this is oozing out everywhere.

CA: This Harvard thing just pushes all my buttons.  Especially my class=20
buttons.  I always had this naive idea of college as a place where everyone=20
is thinking out loud, expanding the world=92s ideas.  And then I read about=20
Elizabeth Bishop teaching poetry there, I=92m pretty sure it was Harvard.  A=
nd=20
she was appalled by the amount of television commercials that appeared in he=
r=20
students=92 poems.  And she=92d see them in the student lounge watching soap=
=20
operas.  But this is all about my disappointments of looking at an expensive=
=20
education wasted on people who don=92t need to understand the value of the=20
money that got them there.

KC: What=92s wrong with television commercials in poems?  That=92s very New=20=
York=20
School, it=92s very Pop Art.  Look, I think this porno is a great thing!  I=20
think Harvard students are aware of the tenuous situation they=92re in.  I=20
mean, you=92re born into what you=92re born into.  And I wouldn=92t turn dow=
n the=20
opportunity to go to a school like that.  But now they=92re going in with a=20
more cynical attitude, =93I=92m a Harvard student, and everyone=92s going to=
 know=20
I=92m a Harvard student, let=92s do a porno!=94  I think that=92s a good ide=
a.  Maybe=20
the institutions are changing too.

CA: Yeah-yeah, whatever.

KC: I like the idea of creativity as a tool to cope with the world, to chang=
e=20
the world.  It never occurred to me until recently that that=92s an attribut=
e=20
which I possess.  I guess I always took it for granted that I was a poet and=
=20
that was always kind of inexplicable.  But that stems from creativity, which=
=20
is an energy.  And you can cultivate it.  You can watch movies, listen to=20
music and read poetry and that just feeds it.  And then you can give it back=
=20
by making your art or writing your poem.  We=92re just approaching problems=20=
in=20
a non-conventional way, which is what we need now.  It just seems now that=20
politics is a caricature of itself, and everything they do is predictable. =20
All their language is double-talk.

CA: All the time we spend watching that goddamm television and there=92s all=
=20
these bigger problems they refuse to call news.  I mean, the prison industry=
=20
is Goliath!  An industry the Republicans and Democrats built together!  And=20
the numbers of people I talk with who know nothing about it astounds me!=20

KC: I=92m one.

CA: They=92re brainwashed by these television programs, what=92s it called,=20=
Cops.=20
 President Bush says that no one in Texas has ever been wrongfully put to=20
death, but we=92re now hearing things, like what my friend Kathleen [Knight]=
=20
has informed me about, where more than 40% of death row inmates who have had=
=20
their DNA tested have been found innocent!  We=92re worried about the price=20=
of=20
gasoline while we=92ve got prisons on the stock market, and many corporation=
s=20
and companies working within that system.  We have been having=20
record-breaking layoffs in America, but meanwhile they=92re building new=20
factories inside the prisons.  We=92ve got Microsoft being packaged by=20
prisoners, Spalding Sports Supplies being packaged by prisoners, Eddie Bauer=
=20
clothing being stitched by prisoners, TWA has prisoners doing flight=20
reservations by phone from their cells.  The list of companies joining this=20
slave trade is just getting longer and longer.  I was at the Quaker Meeting=20
Hall recently for a talk called =93Women in Prison=94 where they said that t=
he=20
average wage in prisons is 14=A2 an hour!  Hell, you=92d make more money wor=
king=20
in a General Motors factory that moved from Michigan to Mexico!  I think=20
they=92re making 40=A2 or 50=A2 an hour down there.  And what we=92ve done a=
nd=20
continue to do to Mexico is simply unconscionable!  America deserves whateve=
r=20
bad wind is blowing our way.  It=92s difficult trying to talk to my family=20
about these issues because all they hear is the television news saying how=20
fucking great everything is!  But we wear a pretty sad emblem.

KC: Well, news is all pretty much manufactured.

CA: Yeah.  This present situation with the prisons is a capitalist wetdream,=
=20
getting people to work for nothing, and fire those on the outside whenever=20
they demand a decent wage!  And if a factory doesn=92t move into a prison it=
=92s=20
moved down to Mexico.  My father has been through half a dozen factories=20
since president Clinton pushed NAFTA through.  They work the hell out of the=
=20
workers, telling them what a great job they=92re doing, meanwhile they=92re=20
secretly raising funds to move the factory to Mexico.  By the hard work the=20
workers do, they lose their jobs.  Something incredible, something pretty=20
fucking beautiful has got to come out of this!

KC: In terms of rage, I think Alice Notley is really enlightening. =20
Especially in that book Mysteries of Small Houses.  Her rage is so apparent,=
=20
and so clearly and immediately expressed.  She=92s got so many great lines i=
n=20
that book, and one of them comes when she=92s reading labels in a store or=20
something and she says, =93it=92s impossible not to be complicit.=94  And I=20=
find=20
that right on.  And that=92s part of seeing the world as it is, seeing the=20
world as gray.  So when I eat my chocolate bar, I know maybe it was created=20
out of slave labor.  But I think realizing that is a good place to work from=
=20
with your anger.  If you know that most things are problematic, then you kno=
w=20
what you have to work with.  And that feeds back into what I said I=92m hear=
ing=20
in contemporary Jazz and poetry.  Anger and stagnancy and creativity all=20
mixed together.  We=92re in this mixing pot.  We=92re not moving forward so=20=
much=20
as posing the questions.  I think that=92s where a lot of art is right now,=20
it=92s in the questioning stage.  I think a lot of the last century was abou=
t=20
expansion, starting with Whitman, and working on up to the Beats.  And it=20
stopped with this extended era of inquiry with LANGUAGE poetry.  Inquiry int=
o=20
language itself, and the whole ontology that language poses to human beings.=
 =20
And now we have this whole lexicon to work from, and what=92s next I don=92t=
=20
know, but it=92s exciting.

CA: I do like to hear the LANGUAGE poets read.  And I like to read them, and=
=20
let their words wash over me.  Something marvelous always itches, and I get=20
involved in the mystery of how things lodge themselves in us.  The first tim=
e=20
I heard Sarah Vaughn sing =93Motherless Child=94 on the jukebox it entered m=
e and=20
will never enter me again any other way but that way.  I=92ve spent my adult=
=20
life convinced if I could just stand a certain way, lack a certain amount of=
=20
sleep, have a beer, a cigarette, open a window that=92s been closed for seve=
ral=20
years, tear back the bedsheets, imagine my feet pickled in sweat, breathe so=
=20
deep it hurts, praise nothing for 48 hours, inch across the room on my bare=20
knees, sell and burn 13 loved books, imagine my loved ones hung and butchere=
d=20
in the yard, tell myself it=92s not my throat it=92s borrowed crepe paper an=
d=20
glass, but still, STILL, after all this, the song STILL enters me the same=20
way as the first.

KC: Jesus!  Well, I like your train of thought about how things enter you,=20
because that=92s what art does--especially music--it comes in under your rad=
ar.=20
 And you need it in a certain place and it never changes.  You always hear i=
t=20
the same way, it always brings up the same ideas.  I=92ve been thinking abou=
t=20
how I create art, which is similar.  Wherever you are in the moment, that=
=92s=20
how you=92re going to connect with the art.  Right now I=92m in this fallow=20
period with poetry, but sometimes lines of poetry will come to the top of my=
=20
head.  And I=92ll think, if I wrote that line down now I could write a whole=
=20
poem, but I=92m just not motivated to do a whole poem, so the line sort of=20
grumbles to itself and then goes back down.  So that poem in that moment wil=
l=20
never be written.

CA: Sounds like murder!

KC: Hey I can=92t serve every line!  I think Ted Berrigan did do it as best=20=
he=20
could.  He had something going on everyday, and he said you should never pas=
s=20
up the moment of a poem.

CA: I AGREE WITH TED!

KC: Well, yeah, I hear you I hear you.

CA: Did you ever think about just jotting that one line down?

KC: Sometimes I do, but I am not in the service of my art.  My art is in the=
=20
service of me.  I am in control, most of the time.

CA: What?  Tell me more about that, I need to hear more.

KC: Well, I don=92t want my art to consume me.  I think that it has in the p=
ast=20
when I absolutely needed to do it to get by.  And that=92s desperate, and I=20
don=92t want to live in desperation.  I=92ve worked up to the point where I=20=
have=20
a stable job, and I=92m in control of my life, which I like.  I think there=20=
are=20
several cliches about artists that need to be broken, which goes along with=20
this idea of busting up assumptions, even assumptions about art.  You don=
=92t=20
have to suffer to be an artist, you don=92t have to live in destitution, you=
=20
don=92t have to be mentally fucked up, and you don=92t have to live for the=20=
whims=20
of your poetry.  I think you can live a fulfilling life and be happy and you=
=20
can be an artist.  I guess I=92m trying to create a new paradigm for being a=
n=20
artist.  And that to me seems to be a responsible artist.  Because if you=
=92re=20
not in control of your life, if you=92re leaving your life up to the whims o=
f=20
your work, then you=92re never going to work in your full potential because=20=
you=20
won=92t have the control you need to direct it where you want it.

CA: Artists who are fucked up and poor in this culture tend to be dedicated=20
folks.  I had mentioned Bali earlier, and it=92s good to bring their culture=
 up=20
again because they don=92t have these cliches of the artist because they=92r=
e all=20
working together.  Art is about awareness, and the captains of our ship don=
=92t=20
like that.  When everyone is creating together, it=92s a FORCE that will mov=
e=20
many things in many ways.  But I want to get back to your idea about the=20
desperation of creating art.  It seems to be more a symptom of everything=20
around us not working the way we want.  Where are the fears that come clear=20
in that?  Could you be equating desperate times with a desperate approach to=
=20
creating art?  I mean, in desperate times, nearly everything you approach is=
=20
done in desperation.

KC: It wasn=92t conscious.  The desperation wasn=92t with creating the art,=20=
it=20
was with my life.  And poetry became an outlet to express terror and sadness=
.=20
 At that time I considered myself a Beat-like poet, who would live in the=20
moment, and probably never be in control of my life.  Like Ginsberg did, and=
=20
Kerouac, which was the height of the Beat ideal, to fully juice the moment.=20=
=20
Like Ginsberg writing HOWL in 72 hours while on amphetamines, and Kerouac=20
typing on these endless rolls of paper.  That=92s how I kind of viewed mysel=
f. =20
So I think that was desperate, because it was giving up my life in a way,=20
giving it over to art.  It doesn=92t matter what you give over to, it=92s st=
ill a=20
loss of control, whether it=92s drugs or art or TV.  Not to say that the art=
=20
you create in that environment wouldn=92t be brilliant, but you can create=20
brilliant art without that, and that=92s what I want to do.

CA: Okay.

KC: But about these ideas that get submerged because I don=92t feel like=20
creating in that moment, I find it interesting how art is completely=20
contingent.  And that=92s why every poem is so precious, because you would=20
never create it that way again.  It=92s like a living creature.  So when one=
 of=20
these thoughts surfaces like a fish, then goes back in the water, I guess I=
=92m=20
sad for a minute, but I=92m confident enough to know there=92s this steam en=
gine=20
running beneath the surface.  You can feel yourself percolating and you know=
=20
things will come out when you need them to.

CA: I=92m often late for things because I=92m not as interested in being on=20=
time=20
as I am in stopping on the sidewalk to write a line down before it=92s lost.=
  I=20
don=92t think anything=92s more important than poetry and doing my best to g=
et it=20
down.  So what if I=92m late for work, big fucking deal!  Did you ever write=
=20
poetry on the toilet?

KC: Rarely, if at all.  Does that work for you?

CA: Well I think I=92ve definitely written my share of lines on the toilet!=20=
 A=20
few of the FRANK poems were written on the toilet.

KC: Wow.  Now, is this before you release, or is it the anticlimax where=20
you=92re relaxing after the exertion?  Because sometimes before I actually m=
ake=20
my movement, I find that to be a kind of anxious time.  Sometimes I=92ll bri=
ng=20
reading material, but then sometimes I just want to enjoy it, because it=92s=
=20
pleasurable to take a shit.  If I read I feel like I=92m not really enjoying=
=20
the moment.

CA: (laughing) Well I=92m a vegetarian.  I eat too much brown rice to be=20
waiting around for things to happen.  Those FRANK poems are pretty short you=
=20
know.

KC: Good for you.  Hm.  Well, I=92m getting this image of a poet living in a=
=20
world that=92s speeding by, somebody like Ted Berrigan really wanting to be=20
there all the time.  I think that=92s admirable in a way.  I think he really=
=20
did want to catch every poem.

CA: And he did a beautiful job!

KC: Yes, but unfortunately I think he neglected other things, like his healt=
h=20
for instance.

CA: I think it=92s Freud who said, =93Everywhere I go I find a poet has been=
=20
there before me.=94  Poetry is so much about really being in the world, gett=
ing=20
to know everything around you.  Benjamin Franklin is a great inspiration=20
because he showed how we need to utilize every possibility of our time in=20
order to find the new, make the new push out and forward.  But then there=
=92s=20
also Elvis Presley, who taught us not only about love, but how to be without=
=20
time, to be beyond time, which then feeds the Franklin idea of getting our=20
hands on the world while we=92re alive, no matter what!

KC: Well Franklin was more a pragmatist, and Elvis was more a spiritual=20
force.  I think this is valid.  You have to have both I think.  You want to=20
be the pragmatic person who can see what=92s going on, but at the same time=20=
you=20
want to let yourself surprise yourself.  And to keep upsetting your own=20
perceptions about what is going on.  Poets I think are on the avant guard. =20
Like Freud said we=92re always there first.  I think poets are ahead of othe=
r=20
artists.  But maybe I=92m just being--

CA: --you=92re biased.

KC: Biased, yeah.

CA: There=92s plenty of visual art that=92s right there with us.  I am think=
ing=20
about what you were saying earlier about just how much art there is.  And=20
I=92ve had conversations with artists, particularly poets, who are dismayed=20=
by=20
all this, like it=92s too much competition or something.  As though any=20
advancement someone else makes will move them back.  It=92s simply not true,=
=20
but seems a terrible thought pattern to be alive in.  The truth of the matte=
r=20
is there IS an enormous amount of art and poetry being produced, so much in=20
fact that we may well be living in the age where being famous is no longer p
ossible.  And what a relief it will be when everyone understands that.  You=20
go into any bookstore and see the dozens of new poetry books being published=
=20
each week!  And this to me seems to be from class structure breaking down. =20
Working class and middle class kids taking up art.  Art isn=92t just for ric=
h=20
kids anymore.  It isn=92t just for rich people to buy anymore.  Fuck the ric=
h,=20
art is coming home!  And the more of us there are creating art, the more of=20
us will create a safer space for those who are a little daunted by the idea=20
of doing it!  And it=92s such an American thing, this idea of living beyond=20=
the=20
class structure which has held Europe in the fist of inertia.  Whether the=20
idea of our classless society was a boldface lie or not isn=92t the point, t=
he=20
point is that many Americans believe it, and belief is much more potent than=
=20
facts.  I could wet myself thinking about what lies ahead for us.  And=20
America, with all it=92s problems, is opening up art with every race and cre=
ed=20
right now.  It=92s amazing, and we=92re all so lucky to be a witness to this=
=20
transformation.  Things can only get better through art.

KC: Are you familiar with Work Poetry?  The best known of these poets I can=20
think of is Philip Levine.  It=92s poetry that=92s written about work, often=
=20
times taking place in factories.  And it=92s so specific that it=92s=20
self-serving, you know, these people write it so they can better understand=20
what it is they are doing.  Some of it=92s so beautiful when it gets into th=
e=20
intricacies of some particular factory job, and how the hands move, and=20
making it beautiful and valuable in that action.  It=92s one of these veins=20=
of=20
art that has been useful.

CA: I wish my father would write poetry.  He has all this desire and beauty=20
and anger that comes out of him in the most sublime ways when he speaks.  Th=
e=20
disappointments of this ridiculous capitalist system have given way to him=20
really understanding himself, and I do mean all that is himself.  And if=20
everything was just as he had originally hoped it would be, and if he were=20
more secure the way he had intended, he may not have come to this clarity. =20
And I know he knows this as much as I do about his life.  We=92re just going=
 to=20
die one day anyway, we might as well allow ourselves the opportunity to pull=
=20
the veil back a bit and take a peek.

KC: Sounds good.

CA: I used to wonder if my father was digging a hole or opening his life? =20
And how easily does this relate to borrowing a cup of sugar from 16th centur=
y=20
London?  Cross genres.  Cross time frames.  Cross the railroad tracks and ge=
t=20
it out already!

KC: That=92s interesting.  I think even Shakespeare was destitute at times.=20=
 A=20
lot of his sonnets were about how he didn=92t have enough money, =93When in=20
disgrace with fortune and men=92s eyes...=94  It=92s about how he feels shit=
ty=20
because he doesn=92t make a lot of money, but in the end he realizes he has=20=
a=20
friend and the friend is worth any king=92s status.

CA: I was sitting near someone recently waiting for a subway car and caught=20
the end of his sentence, which was, =93--about as real as a poem!=94  Well n=
ow, I=20
wanted to know whether that meant things are real if they=92re like a poem,=20=
or=20
if they=92re not real if they=92re like a poem.  And he exclaimed =93NO a po=
em=20
isn=92t real!=94 and he seemed rather disgusted with the idea that I would e=
ven=20
be confused about what he meant.  I=92m glad I asked him though, because I=20
really want to know what people think about the world I consider real. =20
Frankly I can=92t think of anything more real than poetry.  You=92ve got it=20=
all=20
there, it=92s vitamin fortified!

KC: Well, I don=92t know what real is.  Poetry is as real as anything else.=20=
=20
But it sounds like his idea of real is pretty boring.

CA: He=92s allowed to be boring.

KC: I think a lot of people lack creativity because it=92s been sucked out o=
f=20
them.  I see all these people around Philadelphia who live in the club scene=
,=20
or they go out to a lot of bars, and that=92s their lives.  And that=92s the=
ir=20
entertainment, gossiping, and it must be boring.  Their lives are terrible,=20
so they=92ve got to submerge any misgivings.  What are you doing over there?

CA: (rips out Act V of Shakespeare=92s King Lear, then folds it once, twice,=
=20
and administers five staples from a staple gun.)

KC: Conrad has just ripped King Lear apart.

CA: Act V, just Act V.  I=92m sending Lear=92s 5 Nevers away to summer camp.

KC: Summer camp!?

CA: Yes, there=92s a nice lake so Cordelia may rest her weary self.  I=92m a=
=20
little weary of her not resting her weary self.  And there=92s a margarita=20
machine outside each cabana, each machine holds 1,500 margaritas.  It=92s a=20
swell place.  I think it will be good for the 5 Nevers.

KC: How are you going to send it?

CA: It=92s packed up.

KC: Is it there?

CA: Oh I don=92t know for sure.  Once you send something away you=92re never=
 sure=20
if it shows up or not.  My mother always thought I was going to school, but=20=
I=20
was really going to the corn fields to smoke pot.  Maybe the 5 Nevers are=20
really in a corn field somewhere while I=92m fantasizing King Lear hunting=20
quarters for the margarita machine.

Geoffrey,
     I wasn't intendingto take Loss to task here.  I did get a lot from his
book as my forthcoming review will I think make clear.  I was just hoping to
start a general discussion here of something substantive rather than the
top-of-the-head sniping I've been seeing here recently.

I'm up with this one, Hilton Obenzinger, though "pride" sounds almost too
catchy.  While I, too, don't want to congradulate myself for clear
opinionation, I do want to think myself into that state in ways that remain
alive to the issues at hand, in which I read "pride" as the star in the
chest of something mammalian, rather than the masque of either fascist-like
Replublicanism or whatever "liberal humanism" resounds at the other end of
the gauge.  I'd say that as long as pride takes one "over the top",
everything's okay.  It's when "pride" becomes the ID on any sort of license
that something like Virilio's (and /or Chas. Olson's "speed" begins to
overtake and primp up your more common ingenue.  Truth in that sense may
actually be as J.H. Prynne suggests, High Pink on Chrome.

early source

when you were young you could take the wilderness for granted. when you
were young, atomic energy was a promise and a premise of limitless power,
and who knows what wonders would be solved world-wide. when you were
young, the world was mechanized and electrical, and your environment was
composed of fuses, motors, vacuum tubes, rheostats, variometers. when you
were young, public transportation would dominate the future. and when you
were young, the industrial world was based on substance and quantity, coal
and steel. when you were young, there were two sexes and polish on the
radio. when you were young there were fox-trots and polkas. when you were
young, the sky was gray and the papers listed which mines were working for
the day, which were closed. when you were young, the deaths of miners were
reported regularly. when you were young, the world was bounded by
slate-green mountains, slag-piles, thin winding roads to distant cities,
scranton and new york. when you were young, there were heavy snows and
tricycles, and the comfort of an extended family scattered across the
small town of kingston. when you were young, there were jews and chanukah
parties. when you were young, there were the old men playing checkers
around the square in wilkes-barre. there still are. when you were young,
there were bear, and fields in the middle of kingston, and a dolmen in the
backyard of your great aunt and uncle's. when you were young, milk bottles
were recycled and your father came home from a war. when you were young,
you had your first sorobon and japanese children's books you remember to
this day. when you were young, there was no crime and walter winchell
figured the valley for the mafia headquarters it was. when you were young,
pittston was another world. when you were young, there were fears of
floods which came later and earlier. when you were young, you saw a comet,
studied runes, and read about forests. when you were young, everything
seemed old growth. when you were young, we seemed in partners with the
natural order. when you were young, the magic of saturday afternoon
movies, two or three cartoons, the cowboys. when you were young there were
colors and truths. when you were young, your school was your world. when
you were young, there were whispers in the darkness and the warmth of
inconceivable partings and attempted suicides and the ravages of
depressions. when you were young the valley had never recovered from the
depression of nineteen-twenty-nine and never would. when you were young
i'd listen to the short-wave world and the voices of the hungarian
revolution. when you were young, i'd go walking with your father in thick
woods with waterfalls and streams. when you were young, america would take
care of everyone and the poor would become happy and well-fed and wealth
would be redistributed and the world would be full of grace. when you were
young the world would be slaughtered by neutron bombs or doomsday machines
and machinery took on a fearful life of its own. when you were young there
were languages and we walked the woods with the grace of the memory of the
susquehanna. when you were young you assembled a skeleton and when you
were young you found carboniferous flora within the layers of coal and
slate and imagined walking the earlier and earlier and earlier forests.
when you were young there were fierce rains and the crack of
thunderstorms. when you were young your life was at stake. when you were
young you began counting your footsteps everywhere and continued counting
and counting them. when you were young you were twice naked with your
female cousins in hidden corners of expanding sight. when you were young
you would go with your father to the railroad tracks and watch and listen
to the steam-engines. when you were young your mother was perfect and your
father was cold and everything divided that way, the warmth of the women,
coldness of the men, and whispers of darker things. when you were young we
saved a bird with a broken wing which was set, and the bird released, and
when you were young tropical fish graced a tank in the dining-room, and
you remember the angelfish, the angelfish. when you were young, you would
walk and walk and read and read, and tried to learn trigonometry, and were
never disciplined enough. when you were young you would dream of flying
among planets and helping people and helping poor people everywhere and
we'd found a state somewhere in the middle of america and we would all
live there happily. when you were young, you were always afraid. when you
were young, you would have injections for allergies on a weekly basis, and
you would get hives and your lips and eyes would become swollen and you
could hardly breathe and sometimes hardly see. when you were young, you
wore glasses and wore them constantly and were always aware of the doubled
world of site. when you were young you were in love with a woman who
worked for your family and went crazy and disappeared and when you were
young she was always in your mind and when you were young your grandfather
on your mother's side was the kindest nicest person in the world. when you
were young, you would go into his attic and play with the mysteries there,
and there were always mysteries everywhere and they remained mysteries and
always would. when you were young you had a pet snake for a season and a
baby alligator which died and was so bewildered and you could never
forgive your parents and it was the saddest day of your life, and when you
were young the number of alligators and crocodiles was infinite and nature
was plentiful, a cornucopia, and we were all parts of the same world, and
there was war in the world, and the war was all around. when you were
young, we went sailing, and the boat would sway on the lake, and the boat
was wooden and slow and beautiful, and when you were young, the boat sank
at the dock, and it was the drowning of every living thing. when you were
young, your brother and sister and you lived in the same house. when you
were young, you had a small box with the names of your friends and you
would magically keep the names there and your friends would stay forever.
when you were young, you became your only friend, and would read your
secret messages, and everyone disappeared, and at night you would float
among the stars and planets and you would save the girl you had the most
crush on in the world. when you were young, you knew the world was the
thinnest crust, and everything would fall in and through, and it wasn't
even a matter of time, it was happening every day. when you were young,
you thought myself a worthless coward. when you were young, you went
walking in a hurricane and this was your happiest moment ever, and nature
grappled with our world, and it was the same world, and the same nature,
and we breathed the pure violent gales. when you were young, you had a
cash register bank in black and a black machine that showed films on a
tiny screen and was hand-cranked and the films were miracles of motion
unlike any other in the world. when you were young, television was
distant-sight, and the screen was often test patterns and that was your
favorite screen. when you were young, you cried whenever you saw things
destroyed in the movies or on television, and you thought the world was
falling apart, and we were going through the crust. when you were young
you read the medical trials volumes of the nuremberg war trials, and you
wrote about them and were almost kicked out of school, and those horrors
remained with me forever. when you were young, all animals were perfect in
their way. when i was young, i wrote to fill the space of the world with
worlds of my own creation. when i was young, these worlds were a comfort
and a kindness and i could slowly move within them. when i was young, i
was a coward, hiding from everyone. when i was young, my father dominated
absolutely with his temper, and i would hide and never understood. when i
was young, my mother was a solace and a refuge and a world. when i was
young, my father would go walking in the woods with me, and these were my
happiest memories. when i was young, i made telescopes. when i was young,
i watched the world forever and knew i would never participate. when i was
young, i was watching from outside the world. when i was young, i knew i
could never kill a living thing. when i was young, i was alone. when i was
young, i could take the wilderness for granted.

Fence Books offers up the winner of the 2002 Alberta Prize: The Real
Moon of Poetry and Other Poems, by Tina Brown Celona. (By the way,
you can always find a good deal on our website
(http://www.fencebooks.com): Buy any two Fence Books and get 30% off
the cover price. On the site you'll also find contest guidelines and
required entry forms for the 2003 Alberta Prize, which offers five
thousand dollars and publication for a manuscript of poems by a woman
writing in English.)

Meanwhile, here are some blurbs:

Skewed, ajitter, sui generis--the hyper, cyberized world as if viewed
through an old Bell and Howell home movie camera on the fritz, its
motor at quarter speed and burning out, the lens blurred and cracked.
And what an odd, disturbing, startling world Tina Celona's poems
provide.
--August Kleinzahler

Tina Celona's poems unite the contraries of perception (the "real
moon") and imagination ("the moon in my poem"), to realize "the real
moon of poetry." This allows her free rein in both realms ("my dream
and my body") since, after all, they are one. With her keen eye and
fine sense of rhythm, she can include a chaotic world, a vague
family, a difficult farm, a singular loneliness--all in what
sometimes seems a side glance. This is a fine collection and, one
fervently hopes, only a beginning.--Keith Waldrop

*The Real Moon of Poetry* is one of the most engagingly distinctive
first books of poetry I have seen in some time. Read it and weep,
read it and laugh, read it and be amazed. The enormity of saying
anything here becomes palpable, a beauty occasioned by courageous
precision that cannot be compromised or distracted--nor rest. This is
the real deal and that rare thing: an original voice.--Marvin Bell

Tina Celona's beautiful and odd poems are involved in trying to find
ways to feel when the traditional sources of feeling--nature, family,
love, poems and their unadulterated language--are as remote and
ossified as relics in a museum.  It's as though Celona's speaker has
to bring herself to extremes of disaffection in order to regain her
own reality.  I find this quest, with
all its bitterness, self-mockery, and--to put it lightly--iconoclasm,
to be, well, heartbreaking.  Celona's poems do hard work on a
reader's behalf. They want something, need something, from poetry,
and they are not afraid to ask the form to deliver.--Mark Levine

And here is what the book looks like, from the front:


And here is just one of many poems you'll find in the book:

A SONG FOR THE MOON

the moon is more beautiful
later
when i have gone to bed with my poem
about the moon

with my beautiful poem
about the beautiful moon
in my poem

the real moon looks real
too real for my poem

the moon in my poem
is better
for poetry

the real moon of poetry
is better for me

I'm a sinner and I'm proud
Say it loud.

I don't think I need to explain irony to folks, do I?

The fact is: far more people, in all walks of life, are opposed to Bush's
adventures than we are led to imagine.

How refreshing is that?

C.S. Peirce & the Art of Icons Conference=20

Friday, October 26, 9 am - 5 pm & Saturday, Oct. 27, 9 - 12 am
Poetry and Rare Books Collection, 420 Capen Hall
State University of New York at Buffalo

Although many scholars abroad and in this country consider C. S. Peirce =
to be one of the few authentic geniuses America has produced, much of =
his vast corpus remains unknown outside a small circle of specialists. =
Among the reasons for this deplorable situation is the fact that often =
his work is radically unconventional in both content and style. Another =
reason is that Peirce was a polymath who moved back and forth between =
philosophy, literature, mathematics, semiotics, physical science, =
history and much else.=20

Our focus in this conference will be on some manuscripts of Peirce that =
pose especially formidable problems. How are we to understand these =
writings? It has been suggested that we should be open to the =
possibility that sometimes Peirce was producing a mix of poetry, visual =
art, philosophy, mathematics and physical science. To discuss this =
possibility we have brought together literary scholars and philosophers =
of widely varying areas of expertise. Echoing the experimentalism of our =
subject, the structure of the conference program will be somewhat free =
form. No formal papers will be presented, and the schedule will be =
flexible.=20

The Poetry and Pragmatism Homepage for the C.S. Peirce & the Art of =
Icons Conference is now available on the EPC @ =
<http://epc.buffalo.edu/conferences/02/peirce/>.  We will be updating =
the page after the conference with audio and visual files, so stay =
tuned!

Best Wishes,

Hilton. I like Harry but he is obsessed with this: the quote from Twain is
apt. Harry is actually coming from a racist  perspective ...he simply cant
see it... cant see  that in fact that zionism is racist: its implications
are that the Jews are superior to the Arabs ...now that doesnt mean that all
the Arabs are "good guys"...Harry is not seing that his so-called friends
are easily and at right/wrong time his enemies...I saw a programme by the
BBC on terrorism..but I didnt believe it : I dont believe the BBC, CNN: I
dont trust the British or the US even the so-called nuetral presses I
believe have CIA funded "stories" which are cunning ly fabricated as they
were in the Vietnam war days to make people belive that "communism " was to
spread from Vietnam all over the Pacific: all of this to win allies in the
US Military-Industrial oush to bomb Vietnam abnd 9they hoped ) to destroy
China...anything outside the US where people look as though tey might get
some semblacnce of independence: some real democracy: tha language poets on
this list abcked the War against Afghanistan from fear: they have bought
into the crap on TV and the media....I have more belief in Pilger and others
and even in what the Arabs say or think: the whole thing (supposedly a docu)
could have been fabricated  and in fact if one substuitutes CIA for
"Terrorists" there is a sudden change in perspective and possiblities.

You are right to be proud, Richard Taylor.

A Narco News Global Alert

Dear Colleagues,

Veteran Amazon correspondent Peter Gorman - the authentic journalist with
the sources that have allowed him to consistently tell us what Washington
was doing in the Andes before it became publicly known through other media -
reports a story from Iquitos, Perú:

"Two battalions of US Marine Jungle Expeditionary Forces have recently
received deployment orders for insertion into Colombia this coming February,
2003.

"According to reliable sources, the battalions, which with support will
total roughly 1,100 men, will rotate in and out of southern Colombia, with
orders to eliminate all high officers of the FARC (Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia), scattering those who escape to the remote corners of
the Amazon...

"While this reporter did not see a battle plan, according to our sources the
offensive will be led by the Colombian military, which will push the FARC
south toward the waiting Marines. A similar but much smaller operation
involving former US-SEALS was called off at the last minute two years ago.
The Bush Administration is supposedly prepared to take the heat as many
innocent Indigenous peoples and Colombian campesinos—a number that could
reach the thousands—as might be killed in the offensive.

"The presence of US troops in battle in Colombia will be in direct
contravention of the Congressional parameters of both Clinton’s Plan
Colombia and Bush’s expanded Andean Initiative..."

George etal. And it cometh also before a fall, no? But there is that good
pride one has which I alow myself despite so called or real
"stupidities"...hence I try to keep civil with such as Harry Nudel and
others ...after all it could be true: Bush (and company) could be
right...but I like to think that the Bush's of this world (not the burning
bushes) create the "terroism" but then it might in fact just go back to the
question of moral choice and the question of evil: that's the
apocalyptic...or it can lead to that..scenario....after all what are
we...maybe there is something in the concept of the fall ( Imean that it is
as a metaphoric/allegoric "reality") ...and sometimes great poets or "great"
poets "see" these things. I reserve the right to make error ... to be
"angry" on occasion...or "angry with history"....

I recall seeing Nick Piombino's "I have had no bliss since 911"  and I can
understand that: but the trouble is we have to ask  hard questions ...who
really did this, are we to believe the media: as academics do we act or
retreat into aporia and other long terminology...what do we do? I'm talking
as if I was an academic: I'd actually like to be one...I'm probably as
quietist as some of the people I crit.  - after all its all so easy when one
is not uinder fire: but its such as Hilton and others who are valuable
because a degree of objectivity counters my (and others') "bursts" of
lashing at people, and we can maybe learn from him how to read betwenen
lines...and then the Harrys etc warn us to be alert because of Auschwitz and
that is also valid: I can see that.  I myself wanted to "tune out" but I
keep responding: I'd greatly prefer to switch off and "retreat into
literature"  etc.   But maybe this is our purpose on earth, apart from love
and so on, to suffer these moral questions: agonising dilemmas.

  Richard

For which see Marjorie Perloff, "After Language Poetry:=20
Innovation and Its Theoretical Discontents," _The World in=20
Time and Space_:

"At times in recent years, one wonders how long the drive=20
to innovate can continue, especially when, as in the case=20
of [Mary Margaret] Sloan's _Moving Borders_[: Three Decades=20
of Innovative Writing by Women], fifty contemporary=20
American women poets are placed under the 'innovative'=20
umbrella. Given these numbers, one wonders, who isn't=20
innovative? And how much longer can poets keep innovating=20
without finding themselves inadvertently Making It Old?"=20

She notes, however, that "it was not always thus. The OED=20
reminds us that innovation was once synonymous with=20
sedition and even treason." Best example: Edmund Burke,=20
1796 -- French Revolution is "a revolt of innovation; and=20
thereby, the very elements of society have been confounded=20
and dissipated."

I don't know that both contemporary and antiquated senses=20
aren't more or less enacted when we use the term=20
"innovative" to refer to poetry (if with a nonpejorative=20
spin in the latter case). But the word does have the=20
somewhat unfortunate connotation of onward and upward with=20
the arts forever, manifest destiny, cult of progress, etc.=20
I guess I prefer the slightly oxymoronic "experimental=20
tradition" -- we do seem to need a term -- and I suppose=20
that's because "experimental" connotes the laboratory. (Lab=20
not workshop -- producing findings not commodities.)=20
"Experimental" might play ultimately into a scientistic=20
telos, but then progress is a kind of myth in science as=20
well. We don't write in four-stress accentual meter=20
anymore, and we don't think the earth is the center of the=20
universe, but neither predilection is therefore discounted.

I think this topic connects interestingly to the question of globalism.  I have not thought deeply about this, but it does seem that global entertainments must ignore or make minimal use language in order to reach global audiences.  You don't really need to understand English to watch "Titanic."  The most successful films may be in English, but they use language so simply that they could be said to be fundamentally indifferent to it.*

Does that mean that literature, drama, and the other language arts must be regional because languages are regional?  Does it place poetry outside the globalism debate?  Might that be a good thing?

*Just an aside, but I think the inanity of Hollywood dialogue can make us forget that the most intense pleasure of cinema doesn't have to be visual spectacle: it can also be the way great actors perform the richness of contemporary speech.  One example might be Jeff Bridges (a truly great actor, I think) in "The Big Lebowski."  I think that that film in particular has imagined and paid homage to the speech of our time.

Andrew et al.--

Yes, I think it is a very good thing.  I remember reading in several places
that Hollywood directors regularly put in extra sex scenes and car chases
because these are popular across cultures and increase international sales
(which are a big part of a movie's profit, as I understand).  Meanwhile, as
Hollywood neglects dialogue, characterization, and plots that deal with
everyday unvarnished life,  a foreign film that still tries to do these
things sometimes makes lots of money with U.S. audiences (e.g. The Full
Monty, Amelie).  Then, for a while, our media corporations talk about
returning to these values, and maybe they even do it, to some extent.  So I
think it would be a mistake (and a form of unconscious imperialism) to
assume that media influence flows outward from the rich U.S.-based
entertainment conglomerates, flooding and covering all but a few valiant
islands of local quality around the world.  It's at least a two-way flow
(I've come to the limits of my hydraulic metaphor).

Also, I think that it's another form of unconscious and well-intentioned
imperialist thinking to assume that people around the world just ingest U.S.
mass media passively and can only find expressive freedom by ignoring it.
From what I've seen, they actively interpret the stream of mass media that
comes their way and reshape it to their needs, sometimes in ways that would
surprise us.  Examples:  my Cuban friends have some funny/cutting
observations to make about hearing Ricky Ricardo break into hysterical
Spanish on old reruns of *I Love Lucy*; Wynton Marsalis has some great stuff
to say in interviews about the constant interchange and cross-influencing of
U.S. jazz and Brazilian bossa nova, etc.  I think it was Decio Pignatari in
Brazil (whose day job was in advertising) who made concrete poetry out of
Coca Cola advertisements.  All the time, artists around the world are
working in their own local traditions and raiding whatever comes their way
(including U.S. mass media culture) for forms and materials to serve THEIR
purposes, not ours.  To me, this is an optimistic picture:  whatever bombs
we drop or countries we invade, art (and ultimately, the human mind) is
naturally, cantankerously individual or locally communal.

Maybe this is off, but it seems axiomatic that all communities, traditions,=

that what the below is suggesting is that in recent years there are certain=

conventions some use to identify "the innovative." Like, uhh, disjunction,=

parataxis, even a certain Marxist politicism -- or even where the writer=20
went to school or who the writer mentions or alludes to.

That we would establish conventions of who is "innovative" would make sense=

if a certain amount of cultural capital is associated with what can be=20

same kind of ironies as, say, "christian," which more often than not=20
doesn't mean someone devoted to humility, peace, and love but a hick who=20

So my thought would be, "the long drive to innovate" will remain ongoing,=20

While I don't necessarily disagree that the term "innovative" is too
loose, too often applied, and on the verge of meaning nothing, I have to
disagree that because it's applied to women in Mary Margaret Sloan's
anthology (50 poets), that means that all contemporary poets are
innovative. First of all, the poets in Sloan's anthology cover a lot of
ground, and cover not only "this" moment, but at least 70 years in time,
in terms of when those poets were most active (although the anthology
itself argues that it includes Lorine Niedecker because her work started
to become known only about 30 or so years ago). And while she may
include 50 poets, that's not so many; there are literally hundreds of
poets, maybe thousands, who would not be included in that anthology, and
I think Sloan could make a pretty good argument, on aesthetic grounds,
why they would not.

I don't know the answer to this problem. I do think Cole Swensen is
innovative in comparison to Marilyn Hacker, Juliana Spahr is innovative
in comparison to Linda Gregg, Karen Mac Cormack is innovative in
comparison to Anne Carson, and I could go on and on, but this doesn't
tell us much about what innovative means, and it's going to mean
different things in different specific examples. But I also don't think
we can simply lose the term. "Experimental" doesn't work any better;
neither does "avant-garde" or anything else I can think of.
"Experimental" is something easily discounted -- i.e., that's just an
"experiment," even though, of course experiments are not discounted at
all in the scientific disciplines. "Avant-garde" just implies too much
of a war going on on the poetic trenches, although there are days when I
feel that is not altogether untrue.

So I, too, like Mary Margaret Sloan, have settled on "innovative" until
something better comes along, knowing that I have to explain, at various
times and in various detail, what I find that is innovative, and why.
Also knowing that there is something of an "innovative tradition"
(probably much like your "experimental tradition"), and while that may
sound oxymoronic, I love linking my own work and that of other
contemporary poets to poets of innovation or experimentation that go
back 400 years or more. I mean, after all, wasn't Thomas Wyatt
innovative, wasn't Christopher Smart innovative, and hasn't such
innovation always (or at least often) involved using work and ideas of
the past, but not necessarily using it in traditional ways. So why
shouldn't there be a tradition of such work.

I agree entirely, though, that to equate innovation with "progress,"
"onward and upward," and a sense that the new is always better, is
highly problematic, at the very least.

Yes, It Was a Bushmaster

October 25, 2002

Dear friends,

Yesterday, Larry Bennett, a 16-year old, was shot in the head after he
was
involved in a minor traffic accident. You probably didn't hear about it
because, well, how could he be dead if he wasn't shot by The Sniper?

Yesterday, an unidentified woman was shot to death in her car in Fenton,
MI. You probably didn't hear about it because she had the misfortune of
not
being shot by The Sniper.

Two nights ago, Charles D. Bennett, 48, an apartment security guard, was
shot to death after confronting two teenagers in his parking lot in
Memphis, TN. You probably didn't hear about it because the sniper was
too
busy sleeping in his car that night, and thus, poor Charles was not
shot by
The Sniper.

Yes, The Sniper has apparently been caught, so we can go back now to NOT
reporting the DOZENS of gun deaths that occur every day, the ones that
just
aren't newsworthy because they happen in all those old boring ways --
unlike the ways of The Sniper, who was interesting and creative and
exciting and scary! He played so much better on the news.

Of course, had Congress not caved in to the NRA, we would have known
after
the first HOUR of the first day of the killings three weeks ago that the
rifle those bullets were coming out of belonged to John
Williams/Mohammad.
Many more people died needlessly after that day, and every one of their
deaths could have probably been prevented had we had a national
ballistics
fingerprinting data base.

Thank you, Mr. Heston for this unnecessary carnage. Thank you, Mr. Bush,
for supporting Mr. Heston and his group's agenda -- which protects only
the
criminals.

If everyone reading this letter (and you now number in the millions)
would
share this fact with just one person who is thinking of skipping going
to
the polls on Nov. 5th, I believe that on Nov. 6th, Mr. Bush will have
neither the Senate nor the House doing his or Heston's bidding.
Americans
don't like people who assist serial killers in being able to ratchet up
their kills because The Sniper knows that his bullets are prohibited by
law
from being traced to his gun.

That, in a nutshell, is what the NRA is all about -- and I implore all
responsible gun owners and hunters to join with me in putting an end to
the
NRA agenda once and for all. Don't give Bush his majority on November
5th.
He's already seen to it that his cronies in big business have wiped out
your 401 (K), and they are doing their best to see that you are left
with
no pension at all. That alone should be reason enough to NOT pull a
single
lever for a Republican on Nov. 5th. Send a message. Do something brave.

Yours,

the meme of iNNOVELTY or the dynamism of iNNOVATITY?  innovation for
innovation's sake is everywhere. being a culture built on industry that
depends on the idea of old & new to exist, thrive, exploit.

or differently, innovative cultural production which continually
enables a linkage between what has existed & is still useful & what is
imagined to be useful in the future.  the oPEN sOURCE mOVEMENT or the
pERMACULTURE movement are both examples of this.  I hope this is a
prerogative in digital culture too, but with a technology that is so
inexplicably mARKETDRIVEN its cYBERLICIOUSLY easy to get off track...
it has happened to me endless times over the course of my experiments
with hypermedia.

The statement can be found pasted below or online at:

http://www.sfgaycenter.org/news1.php?id_article=3D23


The murder of Gwen Araujo is far from the first anti-transgender murder
and it is with sadness and outrage that we know she will not be the
last.

This is not an isolated incident.

Gwen=EDs murder is representative of a continuum of violence and
harassment in our communities and schools faced by people who blaze a
path for all of us by pushing the lines of gender.

The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs reports that violence
against transgender people went up 41% between 2000 and 2001.  And a
majority of youth in schools continue to report that they either hear of
or experience anti gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender harassment or
violence.

Most of us have personally experienced hate violence against our bodies.
All of us have felt the blow of hate violence in our lives.  When
something like this occurs it brings to the surface old wounds and
renews a sense of vulnerability and isolation.

But we are not alone.

> =46rom isolation, we reach out to build community and act together to
build a movement. We are our friends' found families. We are reinventing
gender. Everywhere we build social service programs, support networks
and community centers.

For all of us, in every community and in every town and city in this
nation:

Gwen=EDs murder reminds us again of why none of us can be silent in the
face of intolerance, or quietly accept the climate of hate and fear that
makes such a crime possible. May we all accept anew our responsibility
to be agents of healing and action in order to build communities that we
all long for and deserve.

In our grief:

We remember Alina Marie Barragan a latina transgender youth who was
strangled to death.

We remember Brandon Teena, a transgender teenager in Nebraska, raped and
later murdered.

We remember Rebecca Wight who was murdered on the Appalachian Trail.

We remember Scott Amedure of Michigan who was murdered after his
appearance on the Jenny Jones show because he said he had a crush on a
straight man.

We remember Ricky Espinosa whose body was found in a landfill in El
Paso.

We remember 16-year-old Fred Martinez Jr whose body was found in a
canyon south of Cortez, Colorado and whose grave was desecrated.
We remember Brian Wilmes of San Francisco who was viciously beaten to
death outside a gay bar by a man screaming anti-gay epithets.

We remember Tyra Hunter, mocked by D.C. emergency workers as she lay
critically injured simply because she was transgendered.

We remember Tracy Thompson who was struck in the head with a baseball
bat.

We remember Emmon Bodfish who was bludgeoned to death.

We remember Chareka Keys who died of blunt trauma to the head.

And we remember countless others in every community targeted for
violence on the street and in our schools.

Harry likes to needle, but I have never called him a racist, and I don't at
all mind his defense of Zionism or questioning me or anyone.  I do think
that horrible crimes are being committed against Palestinians, that many in
the West, including the media, appear to be blind to these crimes.  The
Israeli military attacks schools and hospitals in Gaza, settlers terrorize
Palestinian villagers, forcing them to flee, preventing olive harvests, or
all you have to do is observe the swimming pools and lush lawns in
settlements alongside parched Palestinian farmland to understand the vastly
discriminatory nature of colonialism.  The horrors of a suicide bomber will
obscure those crimes, but they persist.  It's pretty clear, but as
Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld would put it, if you look through the right lens,
you will see what you want to see.  Actually, I think many if not most
Americans are far more aware and sympathetic than the media allows -- and
they are not at all interested in attacking Iraq, despite their legitimate
fears of lunatic violence directed at us.  Let us pray.

Andrew,

I also enjoy Jeff Bridges's wonderful turns of phrases in The Big ebowski";
but you can hardly call his speech contemporary. It is rather retro hip or
retro beat, retro Vietnam, whatever. It is Jeff Bridges's sense of irony
using that language (his pee stained machine made rug "completing the room"
or his admiration of the "trophy wife" or his writing a check for fifty-five
cents or his phantasy bowling dance number which makes the movie so wonderful.

In other Coen Brothers movies the language is merely cute, therefore,
insufferable (the Dakotan accent in "Fargo"), phony (the sepia of "Oh Brother
where art thou"), super pretensious ("Fink").

an interesting comparison is in the indie rock community.  there the by
word is more underground than experimental, but what you do with work that
has been coming from the underground for 20-30 years, has its own network
of distribution (clubs, college radio stations, independent record stores
(Seattle has more of these than it does independent non-used book
bookstores)) that is no way as "underground" as it was in the 80s, let
alone seventies.  notoriously "alternative" became a record store
marketing category after Nirvana broke.  and since pop music is
considerably more commodified than poetry, the rewards (seeming) of
leaving the underground are quite considerable.

at the same time, it seems to me that you really can distinguish the bands
that organically came to their style and those who took the measure of
what folks liked.  and certain tendencies in "underground" music remains
resolutely underground.  which can be disheartening, when it seems that
dedicated and musically sophisticated folks like Fugazi and Superchunk
still tour in vans and hold down day jobs.  and it is not that these bands
are resolutely dissonant (has anyone else noticed that Sonic Youth is
getting closer to being a pop band with each album...a really strange,
Velvet Undergroundy pop band, but then Lou Reed wrote some gorgeous
folk-pop songs which should be standards the way some less deserving
Beatles songs are standards) either:  I remember listening to XTC and
wondering how it was possible that Van Halen could be more popular than
them.  and now it's why don't Jenny Toomey or Rebecca Gates have, like,
1/10 the sales of Avril Lavigne.  The point is that most of the musicians
are not trying to be difficult, but they are also not willing to play the
networking game either.

nevertheless, when I listen to a band like Joy Division, I get the feeling
that nearly every single move in underground music is there and it is
there in the shocking and vivid colors of the New.  here is music that is
genuinely from the "underground."  and one can keep playing this game...i
suppose you might end up at Herakleitos.  at the same time, I think there
is something organic and vital about indie rock.  sometimes I think I
becoming like a boomer who cannot let go of the Eagles, but sometimes I
think, no, the Eagles were always shite, whereas Joy Division (and all the
bands the remind of them) were golden.  and you could airlift, say,
Confucius to our era and he would agree.

the upshot is, art should be defiantly local and communal.  because that
this the only route to the universal (whatever (and I mean whatever) that
is).

John Yau and Anselm Berrigan read


Kevin Killian on Berrigan's ZERO STAR HOTEL: "It's a wonderful book and a
big, huge quantum leap for Anselm Berrigan, whose previous work I have also
enjoyed, but this book is really something different, it gives you the
passionate can't-put-it-down experience of reading a great novel, and
technically it's so assured you don't even notice how he, Anselm, is
producing all his effects. The hero of "Zero Star Hotel" goes on a mythic
quest; the story's told very simply, with lots of gritty detail and an
attention to surfaces and realities that grabs your interest and won't let
go. I can't speak highly enough about "Zero Star Hotel" but in the words of
Paula Abdul, Anselm, you have raised the bar for all of us, you're my
American idol now."

Tom Devaney on John Yau's BORROWED LOVE POEMS "What if Dante watched a
steady diet of movies and was completely submerged in all manner of the
hi-lo late last century? John Yau's new collection "Borrowed Love Poems,"
confronts the reader with a wide and wild array of characters. Like the
Divine Comedy, in Yau we meet all manner of unrepentant madmen and women,
all manner of peace makers and other folks just blown to pieces.

Each character, line and poem forge ahead in the most subtle, absorbed and
artful kind of connections, semantic and otherwise.

Many poems such as "I Was a Poet in the House of Frankenstein," (which I
first read and re-read many times in 1999) are a collection of characters
and connections, which absorb everything in their theater of uninterrupted
and rollicking play.

Yau has at his disposal an abundance of stylistic devices, which variously
show poetry's roomy nature and ability to absorb all other media. From
movies, music, painting, and 'storied fibs piled high,' Yau's animated
vernacular translates the familar all around us from "that cold/hard glue
some zealots/ still call the world."


Yau's love of language and precise and animated surfaces are utterly
convincing and pleasurable."

Proof of Lifelessness



Carried off by waves of fear or "Fear"

when even sad hypnosis fails to titillate

It's time for bigger guns and hands:
                    fingers sparky w/ glass

Uncertain but booming voices along the
              river, you choose your
              afterlife, a most hectic
          last-minute Escape

The fast food windows and sexy menus suppress
                         All wisdoms

Neon holds wide virtues, Waters deeper
                       than the bottomless

You are sudden, are fast-acting, you come
               In pills the size of a Dog

Without your heroes it's another Day
             in Line behind cheap clones
                     of Jesus and the Buddha

When you are pounding upon my bloody chest
                      Shrieking, you feel new
                      Powers

Let's get back to fundamentalisms and
          other card table enjoyments

While you're wishing for moonlight, we got
             poppers, while you're Poet
             Laureate I'll be demonic
                              backwash

Skid row has never looked better, it's
the fucking drapes

    There's a pall over this city, while Mary

Gabriel Gudding is in my ass.
Yes, the minor poet Gabriel Gudding has set up
residence
In my butt.  He seems more major than minor,
Especially when I sit down.
Gabriel Gudding the minor poet never answers
My emails or phonecalls. He says it's too dark in my
ass,
And besides, I am sub-minor poet. I once had drinks
With Kent Johnson, but I don't remember what he looked
like.
After three martinis, Kent said "Say, is that Gabe
Gudding
Poking out of your ass?"  I said 'No, that's a turtle
head."
It was Gabe Gudding, though. He had written new poems.
I was shitting out Gabe Gudding instead of his poems.
One day when I was extremely bored, I wrote a poem
For the minor poet in my ass. It was an extremely
minor poem
But it included sodomy and rape and wine, things we
should
Think about more often.  Sometimes when I'm feeling
wistful
I think about the time Gabriel Gudding took me to the
prom,
And I feel a little sorry that he is ensconced in my
rectum.
After all, we had a great time. The punch was boffo,
And the DJ played all the hottest hits, and Gabe's
wife
Was looking dynamite.  I was at the prom with Gabe
And his wife and Gabe was not in my butt.  We
discussed
Poetry and I licked the underside of his fetlock.
I was very embarassed.  I said, "I condemn thee to my
ass,
Gabriel Gudding," and that was the last time I saw
him.

In-Reply-To:  <3DB96898.5080403@theriver.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

I think you concede the point, Charles, if I may. These
binaries (Juliana Spahr/Linda Gregg, etc.) suggest that
"innovative" can function as a deductive category rather
than an inductive characterization. It would be reasonable
to assume that, were I to write a poem that clearly
demonstrated my sympathetic and thorough understanding of
Charles Bernstein's corpus, but did not on its own display
a measurable "newness," such a poem would be more likely
called "innovative" than "mainstream" or "workshop." Yet
the positive innovation it contained might be marginal or
nonexistent. Marjorie can speak for herself (is she still
on the list?), but I take her to be implying that
"innovative" has simply lost a measure of its explanatory
power, has become somewhat calcified as a designation.

So I'll stick up for "experimental." ("Avant-garde" is
basically a martial variation on "innovative," ne c'est
pas?) Precisely *because* "experimental" suggests "that's
just an experiment" -- "All Thought emits a Throw of the
Dice" -- which throw never abolishes chance -- and because
"experiment" really seems to draw a distinction: it's a
paradigm the "mainstream" does not acknowledge.
"Innovative" strikes me as less paradigmatic than
descriptive of some specific accomplishment. Whereas not
every poem or poet we'd want to put in the "innovative"
camp is actually a representative of significant
innovation, most if not all would be committed to a vision
of the poetic as a site for experiment: hazard, derangement
of the senses, defamiliarization of language, process,
provisionality. As for the "other side" (admittedly it's a
fuzzy borderline): Perloff has another of her funny
examples of official-verse-culture poetry in the
aforementioned essay:

Hollandaise

The sauce thickens. I add more butter,
slowly. Sometimes we drank the best wine
while we cooked for friends,
knowing nothing could go wrong,
the souffle would rise, the custard set,
the cheese be ripe. We imagined
we were reckless but we were just happy,
and good at our work. The cookbook is firm:
it is safer not to go over two ounces
of butter for each egg yolk. I try to describe
to myself how we could have been safer,
what we exceeded. If the sauce "turns"
there are things to be done, steps
to be taken that are not miraculous,
that assume the failed ingredients,
that assume a willing suspension of despair.
   (The Morrow Anthology of Younger Poets, 107-108)

She writes: "Here McCaffery's arrow of reference is flying
straight into the saucepan, ready to curdle that
hollandaise. The lasting contribution of Language poetics,
I would posit, is that at a moment when workshop poetry all
across the U.S. was wedded to a kind of
neo-confessionalist, neo-realistic poetic discourse, a
discourse committed to drawing pretentious metaphors about
failed relationships from hollandaise recipes, language
theory reminded us that poetry is a making [_poeien_], a
construction using language, rhythm, sound, and visual
image, that the subject, far from being simply the poet
speaking in his or her natural 'voice,' was itself a
complex construction, and that -- most important -- there
was actually something at stake in producing a body of
poems, and that poetic discourse belonged to the same
universe as philosophical and political discourse."

"Innovation" should perhaps be reserved for major watersheds
(subject to contestation as they always are (viz recent
discussion of the NAP)) -- Language Writing is of course
one of these, but anybody who writes more or less under
that rubric is not therefore an innovator. Christopher
Smart was innovative, sure (though "insane" was the term at
the time), and Thomas Wyatt -- but here I think you're
talking watersheds.

On the other hand, I don't mean to imply that anybody who
likes "innovative" is lazy or wrong. I didn't get a lot of
sleep last night, and I may be making more of this than I
should. "Innovative" denotes altering, making changes,
making it new, and in one frame of mind you might say that
the designation is meant to apply to composition -- this
seems to be what Tom had in mind in his original post
("from a practitioner's perspective") -- rather than to
intertextual change. But then I must admit, I'm still stuck
thinking the term doesn't really describe anything. Every
poem "from a practitioner's perspective" is an innovation.
Or not?

Best,
Damian

Damian,

As you explain it, I'll take "experimental" any day. Yet in my experience,
and admittedly a lot of it has been living outside places where the
"experimental" thrived, I've been among many who used "experimental" as a
kind of derogatory displacing gesture. Yet I have to admit, I'd rather be
dissed by those who had such opinions about "experimental" poetry, than to
be accepted by them.

So I'm happy to have "experimental" take the day, but I don't have a
particular problem with Sloan and others using "innovative."

The benefit of "experimental" (and I admit that not all will share my
view) is that Wordsworth explicitly calls his work in _Lyrical Ballads_
"experiments."  You can thus draw a direct line from contemporary work
back to watershed that broke the levee, but who is also the progenitor of
the workshop style (though Keats is more often invoked).  By "experiment"
he meant something closer to the scientific sense, but he was also
interested in open forms, bringer subjects into poetry not traditionally
thought of as poetic, and refining poetic language.  It's not for nothing
that Hazlitt said his was a "leveling muse."

Tracing poetry as experiment back to Whitman is interesting.  My sense is
that this is very much alive in Russia and Eastern Europe and perhaps
elsewhere even though it has withered on the vine of consumerism and product
orientation in the US and by extension, much of the internet.

When I 'try' to make a poem or try to read or perform or read one I find
myself more and more interested in the process of trying than in the
finished product and this might explain some of the current fascination with
poetics?   Even though 'innovative' and 'experimental' (in another sense)
and very marketable terms these days in the public's and academic minds I
suspect Loss didn't really intend to give his announcement this particular
marketing spin and this was why i queried it.

Graphic and other Interfaces for the Information Highway


I think, given the discussion about the graphic user interfaces, this
text below might be of interest - it was used in last semester's class
and posted on the Net as well. (From March)

We're moving ahead of the "how do you use the Internet" portion of the
utline, since this, as a topic, has been coming up repeatedly...


Future Interfacing on the Net and Information Highway -


A major issue arising in relation to the future of the Internet and
Information Highway, is the nature of the user interfaces that will
be available. The interfaces are more than transparent windows into
the Net services and databases; they also express philosophies of
interaction. Below are some of the concerns involved.

1. Text or image-driven? Mosaic, Netscape, and other applications
clearly favor image-driven browsing. Pictures are used not only as
ornament, but also as icons governing entrance into the Net. Format
well beyond the traditional look of ascii is becoming increasingly
important.

2. Point-and-click or keyboard-driven. More and more, applications
are moving to mouse interaction. This can be considerably slower
than command-line (typed) interfacing, particularly if aliases are
used; a keystroke/return or just a keystroke can be quicker than
point-and-click requiring two interacting movements. The keystroke
entrance also allows tailoring of commands.

3. Speed of access. How quick is the interface? This is determined
by the local machine, the server, the interface interaction, and the
ability of the user to successfully operate the keyboard or mouse.

4. Menu/Hypertext/Icon. Like all of these concerns, there are over-
laps here. A menu-driven system, like gopher itself, is based on
cursor movement or number-entrance, on a line-by-line basis. If the
menu is long, this can be tiresome. A hypertext system, like the
World Wide Web, uses in general only four arrow keys; again, there
can be considerable scrolling involved. Both of these, of course, can
also use the mouse, which is generally at the heart of an icon-system
in which point-and-click moves around a group of scattered symbols on
the screen.

5. In general, the more polished the interface, the less individual
configuring is possible. But this may change, as image-driven inter-
faces, even point-and-click, allow for access to deeper and more
varied levels than the older command-line operations.

6. In a decade or so, text and image-driven interfacing may become
obsolete, replaced by information-shaping applications utilizing intel-
ligent agents, configured for the individual user. These agents would
have the ability to respond through any input/output, including voice,
joystick, keyboard, touch-screen, and three-dimensional mouse. Infor-
mation and format would coalesce into a single object.

7. Information-shaping would lead to _shape-riding,_ the ability to
figuratively ride shapes, transform them, in a manner similar to that
of "liquid architecture," described by Marcos Novak in Benedikt's
Cyberspace: First Steps. Such shape-riding is based on an individual
trajectory through cyberspace.

8. In addition to shape-riding, there is community interfacing, the
use of liquid architectures or information-shaping to create and
inhabit cyberspace communities, which may be information- and/or
socially-oriented. These communities will be the descendents of the
current MOOs, MUSHs, and MUDs, all multi-user domains found on the Net.

9. Currently, development is also heading toward the _virtual office,_
which can be anything from a full virtual-reality environment to an
office representation on a "personal digital assistant" (PDA). The
virtual office is paralleled by the remnants of horse-drawn carriage
construction built into the design of early automobiles - or even the
presence of the static camera which dominated early film. (The camera
thereby represents the static spectator sitting in a theater audience,
instead of a fully-mobile spectator immersed in the action.) Chance
are that the office imagery will change radically over the next few
years, as users become more comfortable with on-line life, and tradi-
tional routines (even such as downloading to hard-copy paper) are for-
gotten or bypassed.

10. The interface itself, in any form, will become a confluence of
media, including moving images (animations and video in general),
sound, and, in VR, constantly transforming environments. Human inter-
action will change within two decades to more "cerebral" operations,
using eye-movement and brain electrical activity for control.

11. Virtual sexuality will become integrated with future interfacing;
sexuality is already one of the prime content-elements of the Net.
Full-body control and response may become a basic component of commu-
nication; this depends of course to some extent on regulation.

12. The _visions_ that emerge from this - the world as menu or hyper-
text, the body as integrated into communications or data bases, liquid
architecture and shape-riding replacing the static and "obdurate" pre-
sence of objects in real life - will obviously modify the _subject_
herself or himself. It is hard to speculate on what will happen in
these environments in the long term. For one thing, application and
community become equivalent, each creating and interpenetrating the
other. And sexuality, emotions, and politics all become "loosened" in
cyberspace as well; the intensity of _non_ face-to-face communication
can be overwhelming.

Any comments would be greatly appreciated!

Alan

it might be late at night but it seems to me that part of the point here is
that all poetry is experimental in practice unless one is trying to follow
directions.  I think the analogy to making a souffle is apt.  two other
fields I have some familiarity with also contain analogies.  I've absorbed a
lot of information on how to help patients but each individual encounter is
an experiment in how and when I should say to encourage such and such
experimental behavior on the patient's part that might help.  An innovation
here might require some forethought, though, as I could be sued in our
litiginous world.  When it comes to experiment in experimental psychology
there are rules upon rules but a true experiment beyond those conducted as
coursework requires at least the hope of some original knowledge.
innovation here i think would refer to a change in research methodology.

haven't thought this through completely, but I think i recall reading some
things Antin wrote on these issues?

alphabet-couch stew-sea
Torreadoor, Bocky, and Lady Chula with her vaginal bat-imps lay down to =

the corn grow.=20

The world is a serious place said Torreadoor.. I would much rather live =
in lost anchorite fictions packed in infinite gauze
stacked discretely among the descriptions of cat-play.=20

Purple rays of light play across Lady Chula's face from her gilled =
breast bodice.. growling bat-imps rustle under her blunderbuss dress =
flanges
I cant see what the use is of any of it.. What Real use? Simply to say =
it exists and it is important belies a whole strata of interpretation
which constatly beseeches me with rows of solid silver ram's heads, =
blood fountains, where continents of chlorophyll house the vampire =
snail-nymphs
in vibrating square gelatin chalices, giant mechanical ticks run by =
tribes of miniature blue boys..

Bocky is suffering say Bocky saying Bocky is suffering say. All the =
world is suffering. Time-Food. All time food. feeding for saints of =
electron industry.
Fixing sins in the chaotic horse. Yor nose twitches. Bocky sails into =
graveyards. Why the Real. Why live there at all. Its very unpleasant. =
completely
unpleasant in fact. Bocky say language a fiction, hence reality a =
fiction, hence death a fiction, life a fiction, etc etc etc.. you see, =
Bocky crazy now.

The Real is even more unreal than the Real says Torreadoor. It cannot be =
mapped accuratley, predicted with conviction, believed in entirety, =
understood
in its infinite complexity, The Real is more Un real than Real, We =
sleep. That we have no control over. Just like you have a nose. Or poor =
eyesight.
One day you step off the train in Istanbul and you see the fairy fathers =
breathing vermin into the lord's tower, great balloons full of rightless =
animals,
they are just air to fuel the sails of journalism.. The great agencies =
of culture are the only living things, we are snailmeat hor douvres for =
the lubrication of the timeplates.

The letter couches bob on the open sea.. Bocky is using hooks and fibers =
to string the couches together.. see how we can make an island a road =
from these floating letters.. how endless this sea of soft and safe =
letters.. letters have no opinions, their forms are morphology only with =
not relation except to line volume mass
circumference, but when they are linked together become states, islands, =
roads, trajectories, politicisms, garbage fallen from the grace of =
geometry,
the turds of angels..

Geometry is God says Lady Chula, Words are shit, says Bocky.. Torreadoor =
watches the corn grow among the 23 moons which pass thru the giant glass =
toroid castle
where Ivory robots shave their loin horns with jagged steel clams...

Why do you like that question?  I have to admit I don't like asking you

Heh.

Okay, okay. But I will tell you one thing, Broomstick. She looks a
lot better in your shirt than you ever did. And she knows more about
Husserl and his feelings about Heiddegar.

Hilton. I agree: but you can see that zionism or any kind of nationalism can
lead to racism...Hitler in fact talked (in effect) of a "chosen people"
(the aryans (who were in fact people who originated in Iran (hence the name
as you no doubt know) and around there...he was wrong but in those days it
was common for people to be easily and fanatically "patriotic"  this
starting as a good thing: a good pride in one's culture history etc can be
distorted by events and people and in fact competition intra class...between
various members of a class or classes competing for jobs etc and so on into
racism: it is insidious and racism of some sort is probably a potential in
us all.

But I agree that say about 40% of the US oppose war (hence the CIA are
desperately letting bombs off everywhere - including Bali and the ships
etc - to generate an atmosphere of fear and mistrust)..and there are the
"patriot" and anti-terrorist laws: Harry is probably like a lot of people
subjected to the constant distortions of the Western news media including
CNN and the BBC...in fact I think that they spread lies and many in the news
media turn a blind eye: the temptation in an atmosphere of terror (ie in NZ
and the US etc where the boss-class terrorise their workers by threatening
their jobs if they speak out) is to turn away especially if big money is
earned (or alternatively starvation is a prospect) ...in NZ even presenters
get money like NZ$100,000 a year more or less - often more: I suspect that,
with a few exceptions, thousands of journalists, politicians, police,
academics, social workers, secret service people, technitians, engineers,
executives, and others are not only supporting the situation of the
Republican Govt (and the Democrats arent much better they support the ruling
class, the owners of the means of production)  (and also I believe my own
Govt is corrupt - I dont understand why a supposed "liberal" immediatley
committed the New Zealond SAS to Afghanistan, where they still are (one had
his foot blown off by a land mine the other day) without consulting the
people here ...and Clark here does nothing for the poor people where the
city south of Auckland (like New Jersey or Brooklyn to NY/Manhatten) is one
of he poorest in the world ..and even in my own suburb  here is a local
paper headline: "A call has gone out for public sponsorship of poorer
Auckland children, similar to schemes for third world countries"..and then
there is "New Zealanders are being taken advantage if by employers and
working longer hours than ever, says the New Zealand council of Trade
Unions"...now the editor is a character who exposed the corruption of the
police in planting evidence in one of NZ's famous murder cases (they planted
a bullet at the scene of the crime to convict Arthur Allen Thomas (who was
lated found innocent and pardoned)) and now days murders and the crime rate
here is so high no one takes much notice: we have near a higher violence
crime rate now because of  poverty than eg the US, certainly one of the
highest in the so-called "free-world".... so ok he's not in generic class of
"corrupt journalists"...but I wonder how long such independent people (and
he's only a liberal, and in no way particlularly left, right wing on some
issues...)...but these things are the tip of the ice berg...and if you dig
into the US and other Western "justice systemns" you'll I suspect find that
there are thousands of people who are effectively wrongly imprisoned
(Democracy doesnt work for poor people and the homeless etc), or, with a
culture less tuned to violence and avarice, and with a more equitable
society, may never have gone near a prison. The students who in a "random"
investigation faound one person on death row: how many others are there, or
in jail because in the US (and NZ etc) they simply cant afford lawyers etc
and where in the US the firm of Anderson (who were what Dante might have
caled "barraters") simply received a wrist slap?

To misquote Stein: the stain is spreading.

I dont think that Iraq has any lunatics...the lunatics are all in the West
(including NZ)...all the people from Iraq or the Middle East who are Muslim
etc are very articulate and peaceful and well informed and I see that they
see the US as the main terrorist state in the world, which it is for
Chissakes!. If Iraq had deliverable weapons Bush wouldnt even talk of
attacking Iraq. There is no reason for a war anywhere. I see Hussein as more
rational than Bush. The people support him very much, as I do. The people of
the Third World are in for some terrible wars and slaughter before this is
all over but ultimately the US  and British Imperialist (grovellors) will
disintegrate.  As Mao tse Tung said: they are paper tigers.

  Who, then, if she called out, would hear Virginia among the angels'
ranks? And even though one of them might pounce her to his breast, Virginia
would surely be submerged, drenched, & quenched: much monstrousness abuts
through beauty's view - and the supernatural is
feared because we fear its reasons for not joining in on nature's killing
spree. So raise your finger to your lips, Virginia, you will not
call out beyond this classical pose.

  Son of a bitch! - Who else can you run to when you most need to cry out?
Neither angel nor actuality, only a classical precedent that lies between.
Even the dumbest mutt know we don't quite fit in this mediated world. MAYBE
there is some face, even in a snapshot, that we can turn to for solace - or
take comfort in the supposition that, as plants produce oxygen for us,
perhaps our despair gives life to the creatures around us.

  Yes, maybe the Spring needs you. Maybe you bring breath and smiles to the
farthest star. A wave washes toward you for the same reason a flower turns
toward the sun.

  But how can you WILL it, Virginia? Isn't this what you want?

  Don't you live for premeditated acts, and schemes?

Anningan is a hypertext chat-bot, still in progress, still evolving; it explores the economies of presence and absence, obsession and affection, relation and distance, voyeurism and hatred, sex and death and love and madness...

This is a test version, still progressing...there are approcimately fifty small paragraphs of text to be read, and over twenty pages of code controlling the piece...each visit to Anningan is different; what you read depends on how you respond...

Please tell me how this is received...I've been working very hard on this piece for the last two months, and though it's incomplete it's in a state in which it can be shared and hopefully discussed. I need input to determine how the piece is working for others.

aw c'mon robert, the eagles ain't shit!... they might not be the
"band of the 70s" or whatever it was ~rolling stone~ said about them
way back, but their sound (and for my money, lyrics) really hooked
the moment...

it seems to me that what you're addressing is important, though, and
has to do with the status and valence of pop culture today... and
what i'm wondering about more and more these days (esp. in the wake
of something like npr's recent series on music recording
technologies, which ends with this notion of "the revenge of the
amateurs") is how the shift being brought about by d-i-y techne is/is
not to be correlated with the economic shift of the past three
decades...

here i have in mind something like paul krugman's piece in ~the new
your times mag~ this past sunday ("for richer") which details the
rise and fall of the middle class... thank the lord someone has
finally come out in mainstream media to challenge these halfwitted
arguments we keep hearing e.g. about how high ceo salaries provide
overarching  economic incentive---and thank the lord it's someone who
has the economic chops to make such an argument stick... but in any
case krugman suggests that, since the 70s, so much more wealth has
been concentrated in the upper 1% of income earners that this 1%
pretty much calls the mainstream's political and even intellectual
strings...

(it works out to something like this:  13,000 households, if that's
what they are, now earn about as much money as the poorest 20,000,000
households... staggering, really... and krugman's point is that this
was not not not the case 30 years ago...)

now here's why i bring this up:  i'm on a campus at present where (as
i've finally been able to ascertain based on admission profiles
provided to me by members of our student govt---which is, from what
i'm told, the largest student gov in the u.s.) we have somewhere
between 41% and 55% of our undergrad student body hailing from
families that make more than $250,000/year (and btw, this latter
constitutes ~ the top 1% today)... further, roughly 1/3 of our
undergrads come from families with liquid assets such that their
parents can write a check for $100,000 or more...

this is, i'm sure you'll agree, mindboggling, esp. on a state campus
with in-state tuition  running at ~$2500/yr, and out-of-state tuition
running at ~$18,000/yr (class warfare?  you bet!)... true, we are a
major research institution, but cu has nowhere near the clout/rep of
~us news~ "top 50" universities (of which we is not one)... where you
can expect to find a student body with e.g. even more disposable
income...

now out of the 38 students i'm currently teaching, not one seemed to
think s/he hailed from such a family... clearly these folks don't
know what their parents have in their savings accounts---and probably
don't understand that the 5 bdrm/3 bath/2500 sq ft + house they were
raised in signifies a certain amount of wealth, plain and simple...

these are also the folks who are busy swapping mp3 files (many have
recommended to me that i give a listen to fugazi, which given your
nod, robert, i feel obliged now to do), and burning cds (some have
kindly done this for me)... many of these folks in my classes are
hardly outwardly materialistic---i mean, i'm teaching almost
exclusively *english majors* these days (some will say only the
wealthy can even BE english majors---which, while not true, is
certainly ringing truer & truer at the phd level)...

so in essence, these folks constitute the consumer body (future, if
not once) that fugazi and similarly shoestring (if this is the right
word) bands can hope to generate a following in... is this the pop
effect of, oh, 1975?...

hardly!... we all went out and picked up the latest lp (in our case
it would have been eagles, david live, what have you), imagining
ourselves---whether as working or middleclass proper (which
distinctions krugman unfortunately doesn't quite detail in his piece,
even as he reduces this latter economic disparity c. 1970)---rather
bonding "through" the sound/lyrical entity in our midst... social
cohesion?---perhaps... but surely not of the individuated variety...
i mean, Big (klipsch) Loudspeakers where *in*---there's that communal
effect again, cutting across class distinctions, however
hallucinatory that cutting across may have been... this
hallucination, if you will, amounts to a shared social belief---and
in point of fact, one of the more amazing turns in krugman's piece is
his argument AGAINST former economic models of ceo-amplification and
middleclass woe... i.e., he argues for a concept of *social norms* to
explain why indeed it took 35 years (after wwii) for executive
salaries to increase exponentially, and workers to start trailing
exponentially... e.g., in krugman's analysis, *executive culture* was
less greedy, more ethically bound in 1965... (i think this argument
too can stand some drawing out, but what a refreshing change it is
from the globalization/technology arguments we've been bombarded with
for decades now... e.g., u.s. workers couldn't compete with overseas
labor yadda yadda yadda)...

now:  if such an argument can hold sway in economic discussions of
the top 1% and how they got there, i think we need to start thinking
perhaps about the ways in which pop culture is deforming
(balkanizing?) to match this current (yes, nomadic, mobile) state of
consumer affairs (i'm all for amateurs, but sometimes a great notion,
methinks)... our responses as poets/writers probably need to be
examined in this light as well, assuming we respond in any sense to
pop culture (and btw, we just saw ~L.I.E.~ last night---great
flick)... i assume most of us, dana gioia aside, are not in the top
1%, but i rather suspect more of us are in this percentile than we're
letting on...

well, all too hasty suturing, as always, and half-baked perhaps, but
surely having something to do with the question of the
"innovative"... and i think y'all can understand why i *still* like
the eagles, yeah? (ha)...

best,

joe

Saint of Patrons


If you can Move to the mad Code
           and perform "the assassin"
           a new favorite dare

You can quash All resistance and sip
                           from oceans

We're driving on Expired licenses to kill,
                     headed for False
                     Positives

There are stiff burdens To be shouldered
and rich folk           to Mock

Keep Up and flourish amid shaky paradox,
                     stay for the eggs or

Presume to find pleasures in Languages

What doesn't jive?  The numbers don't
                    Always lie

I cringe at the lack of Rewind
           I'm dirty as Hell

A white sheep Among bleach blondes

Unrecoverable vacancies of luck, which
          explains why I'm so
          Enamored of the St. life

We're busy arguing Spermicides with
                   our eyes on the door

Things I am thankful for: colorblindness
              every selfish emotion, the Axe

This year was my Therapist's treat,
             written off by Taxidermists

Smother me again in sleep, together
         forever with pushers of the Blue
in the very last      smoky Corners

Giving People the Finger All the Time


Displace and forget, Honey, how
                          once Cherished

Never getting wet enough to go in Easily

        It's too late for a coup de tat
                              but *thx* for Asking

Kissless evening and vacations Spent
                         hooded, dive bar to
                         point of crash

Front row while youngsters Make out

The poet, transfixed with the same old
                              motions, considers
                 blow jobs chased by guilt

Make more adorable faces in places
           with mirrors

It's wild to forever Be hungover
                  which puts the funeral
                             in fun

We're making Friends after the
                        vomit and panicking

give the old monks a Call for the
                     hell of it

Possess your own nagging nostalgias

But think of me past military bases
or on the faces of each surrendered soldier
                                        worldwide

The green standard issue

An envy of Sorts, earned
Or thrust upon
              like the wasted life

Virginia and the Rest-less

Well you may ask, when she whistled, thumb and forefinger between lips, why
bother to call out with a shriek like that and the angels among them. Forget
it. More on the head of a pin not counting the heads, but let's not digress
or start counting backwards. As for he: son of a bitch doesn't begin to
describe him, the shite in wining armour something between a shill and a
proposition, no etiquette whatsoever, third street proposition, no strategy
for even if you can imagine Seven Card Stud.

His ass is, as they say grass, and and more to the point and/or equally -
deny as you might -  his dick is just dirt. But whisper it not and even
randy little duchesses have lured him to their arms but when that third
heart hits the board and there's a lot of action then somewhere, someone,
Virginia, has made the flush so don't run out of chips on your classical
shoulders.

And the son of Nun or no one - geddit -  went out of Shittim which
abbreviated. Oh! It's enough to cripple the deck, rest assured.

Take comfort in the supposition? Takes comfort in the proposition and takes
comfort not in such radiant benediction that his chances of sucking out on
the opposition in hold-em until Abyssinia are zilch. Could be, perhaps
maybe, Spring needs her like a loch in kop and don't waste her time with
smiling at stars, sunshine, me redt zich oys dos hartz and don't waste it
either with flowers-schmowers and personal questions regarding premeditated
acts. There are places to go and glaciers to melt and waves washing towards
her in her fur - nisht fur dich degacht. Na!

She wills what she wants.

A huge (over 50,000 people) - it's still going on - anti-war demo in San
Francisco today - tangent with the other many large ones radiating across
the country, (over 100,000 in Washington, D.C).
Locally there are many tributes - including signs - mourning the loss of
Paul Wellstone. A huge sadness here.
Nightmares have become responsibilities.

Bill. Its probably ultimtely a class question, but of course, its who and
what one reads, one's own personality: degree of political "nous" and so on.
people we know for example become strongly religious because their parents
were: others reject religion for the same reason.  Most people are
influenced by their parents ..but there are many other influences. John
Geraets in the ..can I call it "innovative" NZ mag?.... has recently
explained his aesthetics: interesting as that "explantion is" one suspects
that Geraets likes being "in aporia" and moving with the moment's ever
expanding bubble... (and some of my own writing moves in directions loosely
of a similar kind of philosophic: if not being anything like Geraets's work
in texture)...and in fact about 1994 I "liked to think" that I didnt need to
think about politics, and to some extent it was my "discovery" of the
Language Poets that "incited" or excited me to look at the politico-social
aspects of language practice, and perhaps that is ironic or paradoxical
...or to at least become aware of the link so to speak...but around that
time I was more attracted to what I suppose was  or could have become a sort
of elitist aesthetic: the poetry that most interested me (and a lot of it
still does) was not predicated on any presuppositions, and required poets to
be extremly well read if not PhDs (or at least very interested in poetics
etc) -  I was interested in the innovation and experimentation and the
"crazy stuff" for "individualist" political reasons I suppose. I had done
some political satrical work and some vaguely Ashberic stuff but was wanting
to move toward a "higher" poetic/poetry......and at that time I contributed
to a small mag called Salt (NZ) which Scott Hamilton and Hamish Dewe
published... and at that time (about 1994) one of Scott's tenets was that
they were having "no political correctness"....I was attracted to this
semi-anarchistic approach ...but at various times in my life, "life" such as
the fact that I have three children, and now a grand child, impinges on my
work...and even here there is no escaping the effects that S11- more Life -
Lfe of Dream? - or Trauma? - had on us here even in NZ (where we all of
course  have televisions) so if it was a CIA stunt it was pretty spectacular
and effective one: my initial reaction Bill was in fact very pro a kind of
Bush one as some strange events had preceded it....I had met an Iraqi the
day or so before (who was actually Babylonian) ...then I had my friend who
is (he disagrees quite strongly by the way with me we've had some real crazy
arguments, he thinking that the Muslim extremists are the bad guys and so
on) but in a library I had met an older American women and somewhow the
question of  refugees (maybe I mentioned the fact that I had actually met a
Babylonian and thought she'd be interested in that) coming here was raised:
she raised the "terrorist" spectre, calling (people in the Middle East )
"hot blooded, then I had some strong words about recent US history, then
she: "So you're anti,eh?" and so on. But then my friend  suggested that
someof the people coming here could be potential terroists...now, nowadays I
think that that is possible but not important: and a day or so after those
encounters "whammo!" I wake up to a phone call from my son wanting me to
turn the TVon and there it is: towers bursting in the violet air and the
whole thing surreal and strange and then I sent an email wanting to wipe out
all the Arabs...but I changed my position...I started to think more calmly
and I became "suspicioned" of Bush and the BBC and so on. Charles Bernstein
did those quite excellent "reports", and I did a lot of probably a bit crazy
"raving"...so the whole fireworks display of S11 has polarised and
politicised or re-politicised people throughout the world.....and as you
imply, where one stands is often what one likes to think for various complex
reasons.

 Regards, Richard.

What a pretty  picture....the female instructor, wearing only a handsome
man's shirt, teaching 20th Century philosophy to the eager Bowering, who
sprawls at her feet, looking intently up.
  But it is clearly a fantasy. The woman in question would not spell the
German philosopher's name the way you,o Corrector of Spelling,  spell it.
 If you are without sin, as you claim, you are not without error. And Rachel

V E H U I A H  is the first name of God and means Exalted. The
Tetragrammaton [YHVH] is the four-letter divine name which God revealed to
Moses (EXODUS 6:2). It is composed of four hebrew letters:  Yud, Hey, Vav
and Hai. According to the judaic mathematical/mystical science of gematria,
the tetragrammaton, when spelled out as one word, yields the numerological
equivalent of seventy-two: Yud+vav+dalet=20, Hai+yud=15,
Vav(vav+yud+vav)=22, and Hai(hai+yud)=15.


this new project by the worldwide literati mobilization network, conceived
by emile vincent, comprises the multiplicative rearrangement of each of the
72 divine names
there are 1,000 volumes for each name
the cover artwork for each volume are screen captures of the Old Testament
in hebrew, also known as the Five Books of Moses.

thanks david. it's like our own (mn's i mean) 9/11 --and bush hasn't
even acknowledged it.  and the news is full of the damn sniper, with
tiny scrolls of news about wellstone trickling across the bottom of
the screen...i ahve no doubt that this was a political assassination,
myself.  but that is exactly why i think it will backfire on the sick
ones.  xo, md

Trees furiously rusting. Now, Brittany thinks, sighing
soft
mantras on digits to the curve of her breasts, which
in
silhouette amble forth like an odalesque repealing
appellate
justice, like an honesty of juice and sliced oranges.
Yes, Brad,
now the trees furiously rust, and continue to do so,
though
warnings of soft skeletal awe memorize harsh shining.
As for I,
forget it; ego and eros are not synonymous terms. It's
hot when
we wake up, our sinuses curling, and Renee rolls over
to Lewis
with her shirt half up; he readily wakened, weeping
velvet in a
pit of his own winnings (neurological): he jazz lake,
he lurk
straight, he row fake caves through the soft palatial
tissue of
her mouth; molding moon in it, waxing tide in it,
washing soap
until it codes docile and solvent, voting. "I'd like
to buy the
world a coke," Brittany moans, and when Brittany moans
a small
very firm crystal chip learns primate behavioral
patterns by
leaping through bonobo speech; "Jesus," says Brad.
"I'm hanging
around here like I stole someone's holy land."

Virginia Berated by an Elder: the redle of sredle

And always composed disposed an afterthought interpretation space of the =
edgy nerves ending. The panicked-you were thinking about this morning. =
This morning? Or the morn's mourning. The runt, blunt someone speaking =
to someone else's unfolded listen to your insolent stagnant intimacy in =
leaves. Leaves and/or remembered layers of your Mormon experienced =
memories, the recognition of which sent, went unrecognised before no =
single point defining event around=20

and around in the usual circles of sublime circulation. The judges and =
Elders listening closely and forming a-linear quivering collusion, =
nonetheless demystified and make no mistakes circulates. Where does it =
end? In their dreams, pre-judged, no doubt and found to be lacking in =
consideration of broken warped delicate and/or embarrassed. Tell me =
about it. Tell you what? Whatever's on your mind. What's on your mind? =
Anywhere near your mind. And: Do you mind? Hardly an agitation left on =
the windowsills. Blown off/from any unclenched suffocating truth. Dear, =
oh deary me-oh-my. Oh. Remember the past year? Any impressions, sensory, =
visual or otherwise stimuli? Had any or heard any voices, lately? What =
are voices? You know, something that sounds. Without the peculiar, =
feathered body and/or presence of mind. Do you mind? What else? Ah, a =
slow dissolve. The resolve to dissolve. It's distances all over again. =
It's the real thing. The intervention of prophets on walls of =
circulation and a real free breath of hot air. Distinct weight of. =
Heaviness. You sense that weight, but no, sir. This is not gravitas. =
This is not relevant nor the antidote to the linear quiver of the =
befuddled and muddled ego taking an oozing bath of suffocating soaps =
bubbles. In voices. Which. Speak. So. that. They. Can. Simply. Be. =
Heard. Voices weigh with words and the words weigh. What do they know =
and what they do not know. About anything or about themselves. What do =
you know? What can you know at any one time except for the others' =
voices coming at your direction. Does it happen in pontificating signs =
the someonething-for-everyone vitriolic inter-penetrating acoustical =
ACROSTIC. Where is the voice coming from? Not the voice of judgement =
which comes from those best qualified to judge from the lime pit. The =
sublime pit. The pit-bull watching the watcher who self consciously =
watches her self positing the writing on the wall now SDRAWKCAB!!. That =
is but the mirage in the wilderness. Of course. SDRAWKCAB!!. Where in =
all? LLA. Draw conclusions of charcoal and a little =
something-for-everyone formed of and in the predictable identity of the =
non-identity. The statement therein enclosed concealed revealed in the =
sdawkcab wilderness of something for everyone. The permission to, if all =
is said, undone/unsaid  BENEATH A SEA. Well, now. Whoever would have =
thought the sage so sage and her loss of the sense of the profound =
confounded. Damn right one can personae on non as one choices and no =
grata about it. It's called read and or hear and respond or DELETE. The =
prophets of fatal projections. Again the refusal. Again. 'Fraid so. One =
cannot, cannot accept all the relevant irrelevant on its face. Or hands =
or knees. It all depends what rings. And how. At any given time. One =
voice speaking does not necessarily provoke another listening and the =
other listening does not necessarily provoke anything at all but some =
do. Some and not others do read another or one. The trace in space of a =
spitting gesture. How to insist TSISNI and keep GNITSISNI about the=20

This moves one to measure the effect of your words Why are you there? =
Are you there? It wasn't the words in your mouth. It was surely the =

I'm nobody, rubbing hands over luscious pervasive
curves of air.
See my live webcam. I wait all day for the rubbery
thread you
started in lists to tremble; when it does, I swallow
the
vibrations. A string, plucked from lump sums of
products; I'm the
multiplicand, catty like a track record of spit and
oval
solution, all of which takes this shape to be its
lawfully webbed
wide-eyed WASP.

     In the breakfast nook, coon-dogs bellow mixed
neighborhood
watch to time the replication of hourly role-playing
by a root of
node folders demented. With cement in my lungs,
circuitry pits
awe against doldrum jailing again and again; I can't
even begin
to express my surprise when I look out my window, with
so much
space slathered everywhere and everywhere at once when
I'm
looking. Where does it go when I turn away?

     I'm nothing in particular, I said, though I knew
she was
sleeping. I'm empty and aching and I don't know why.
Still,
before the dinosaurs ftp their extinction to maximum
disk space
useage quantized to a bible, I'll be able to witness a
wryting
using AIML to format my responses. A corn-dog in the
civil rights
 movement should behave quite in particulars, like
teeth sprayed
with lucid grammars of momentum vexed. And the string
glistens,
and the string moves too fast to see.

potes&poets press is pleased to release the following books of innovative
poetry. ( fly and be free ! )


'Memory Cards & Adoption Papers' by Susan M. Schultz
ISBN#1893541-70-3

Does culture invent language or does language invent culture? In Susan
Schultz's 'Memory Cards & Adoption Papers both realities teeter and crash,
making Origin a profligate occasion without end. These poems examine the
dynamics of Being through the linguistic portholes of individual and
collective history, knowing all the while that "our natural language is
translation, and we cannot get it right." And yet, even inside the
simulacra where " the language is a nomad...which eventually pulls up its
tent....," Schultz's dedication to the living imaginary is unflinching.
"What we owe the commonwealth is allegiance to the common," she writes, and
Memory Cards & Adoption Papers reifies that fealty. A brilliant book!
-Claudia Keelan, author of Utopic and other volumes


'Tri Loka' by Ivan Arguelles
ISBN# 1-893541-72-x

Ivan Arguelles' poetry might best be described as a labyrinth except that it
is also a house afire. This work continues the extraordinary experiments of
books like 'Madonna Septet'- books which verge on the indescribable.
Arguelles work thrusts us into a world in which absolutely anything may be
said. The book deliberately tests our capacity to read it as it continually
deconstructs the very guideposts to which we cling-in vain. The theme of
this " fictive diary'/this excerpt from the unwritten poem" is the poets
encounter with the "Other"-and particularly the Other as woman: goddess,
mother, pop star, "the terrible mix up of girl, friends/wife lovers and
cancer patients." Yet this is like no love poem in the history of
literature. The idea of the "Beloved" is still another guidepost which the
poem finally removes from us....- Jack Foley



'Simple Theory" by Allen Bramhall
ISBN#1-893541-74-4

The possibility seemed exhausted for rocking, contemporaneous, tuneful
poetry witha distinctively Yankee accent once John Wieners passed on. Allen
Bramhall's 'Simple Theory' pours cold magnolia water all over such a snag,
yielding accelerated pleasure with each drenching verse-postulation of long
lifetimes in poetry's perpetual and immediate surroundings: grace,
ardor-gazing, day-to-day crisis. Don't let these blocks of prose fool you,
'Simple Theory reads and sings as a 21st century Inferno-cum-Paradiso,
self-regarding narrative thrust along with the attendant versemaster's
craft. Bramhall jesters and clowns his way to the top of compassionate
detachment-an exceptional achievement. --Jack Kimball

The Heart of Friday Night


hatefucking the help until it's time
                          To chill

Blackout until your show is on, on
                   the outbound side a
                   cross of Abandon and
                   shaky

Free of the fallout from Yesterday's
                  meltdown, we'll
                  skip and Jump

Braced for the bumpiest of rides

During EKGs we yearn for vengeance

Awaiting that secure feeling that Might
                      one day assuage

We hop the turnstiles, becuz we can
                      Hop

Namedropping brashly while they're all
                 falling asleep

Everyone you know is always in Peril
             of cuts that might Forever
                 gush

Now nurses bounce to the beat as sunglasses
                        pierce and Deflect
                        fluorescent tortures

You can be certain of the quality
                   of prescriptions, somehow
                   Closeby

Pick someone who's sweat feels Real

Sliding down the small of your back

Fingers reach the latch, relief
           be Sweet be trick

Rainy Season


If we lave it Up to cockblockers
           Where would we be?

Ceilings and paper towels, that's
             *Where* alive for
             a Stretch to Dry

Or curve away splendidly

The Western front is all talkback
                and bookblurbing

At this rate we'll Never see the
             Bottoms of icebergs or
             Visigoths as they flank

Fetch the paddles and let's palpitate
                  until the Blow wears off

Even the biggest assholes just want
                  to be Probed

Don't fall on my head again, it's
          distracting my Dynamo

Enchant prissy chicks into leather
                      Seats and
                      Getting *crazy
                      bitch* tattoos

Does it really matter who you're holding
                      onto for dear life

During the Flood at the end of the World?

Probably, but hold off making those Unique
                       partnerships until

The water stops rising.

I kinda wanna dress you up in
                 My love
and throw you an orange Line

Please disregard (for now) the announcement I forwarded last night on Kit

To all,

Please hold off on forwarding Lyn's email.

Due to a scheduling conflict (Ron Padgett at SFAI!) and other factors, we may

One hopes so, but I am pretty pessimistic about that. I mean who
would have believed that Bush and his Oilmen could have got away with
what they have got away with so far. We need an antagonistic
superpower with ABombs etc. You will note that Bush is not talking
about how he's going to bomb and invade North Korea.

Stephen Baraban,

You ask (copied below) what the analogy exactly may be that Olson was
suggesting between himself and Beethoven.

What becomes evident to me in Olson's 1962 Goddard reading is that the
problem of performance and of score, of speech and of writing, are
conflictually inter-related. He imagines himself as a Beethoven, "deaf" but
composing anyway. "I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not -- I'm Beethoven!"
Olson says. Or in other words, I'm not a performer, I'm not performer X, Y,
or Z, I'm the composer. A performer needs to be recorded in front of a live
audience, but the composer only need (correctly) score the work.

However Olson admits to trouble in scoring -- which I take to be an
admission that scoring is not that easily differentiated from performance
after all, that any scoring is already an attempted performance (as it must
be if it is to function as a score in the first place) -- even, an attempted
recording.

But then what is the analogous "organ" (to Beethoven's ear) that Olson does
not "need" in composing a poetics which seems otherwise fully intent (and
dependent) on projecting and utilizing *all* the organs as breath
embodiment? To be "the composer" is a mode of written enactment that would
seem to want to transcend his own projecting organs (in performance),
notably the organ of speech (*that* is post-humanism?).

OR, is it: To project the organs in a mode of written enactment attempts to
transcend writing. Writing is a kind of defunct organ, sort of like the
appendix we once apparently used to digest grass, or a kind of unknown organ
without digestive function. (Steve McCaffery’s wide-ranging essay in Prior
to Meaning about Olson's interest both in Mayan hieroglyphs and in
projective verse would seem to bear out the latter, i.e. projective verse, a
phonocentrism, attempts to transcend writing.)

Best,
Louis


Dear Louis Cabri,

[…] I'm very curious about your feeling that there's something analagical
going on in O's reference to Beethoven, rather than some other composer --
B.'s loss, & his soldiering on despite it, are analogous to what? I couldn't
get at what you were driving at.

So could you possibly expand on that to the List, or to me, as solitary
lurker?

[…] A free association re scoring & performing -- it's very interesting that
Beethoven in his later years indicated metronome markings that are
considered quite perverse.  It's very hard, apparently sometimes impossible,
to perfom as fast as Beethoven proposed -- & where possible, not necessarily
best for the music, the musicians say.

[…]

Thanks again,
Stephen Baraban

Louis,

Also, there must be room in this distance between scoring and
performance, for interpretation. Is part of the trouble with scoring,
perhaps, the knowledge that the spacing and everything else on the page
will be interpreted differently by readers/speakers? And indeed,
Beethoven's scoring is only the enabler of performance, and not, in an
absolute way, the determiner of it. And of course this is not something
specific to Beethoven, nor is the problem, in writing, specific to
Olson; it is something faced by any writer who uses the space of the
page, or the look of the type, or any other visual aspect, as something
that would influence the sounding of the work.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

When you look at

http://jeffreyjullich.tripod.com/DROSOPHILIA.htm ,

you see a number of things:

a black background with a Tripod ad banner at the top;

a two column table with a narrow, yellow column to the
left and a wide black-background column to the right;

within the left-hand yellow column, there is a series
of "words", some non-existent in English, such as
"PHANNG SININN NAAS / NEQE ANND HIYH HYH"; others, in
boldface, are actual English words: "SKA TEA GHEE"
(ghee: a clarified semifluid butter used esp. in
Indian cooking) "VAN SEAS SAD DEP" (Dep: a hair gel)
"TIS KIDS LAP GIF FAG", etc.;

within the black-background righthand column, there is
a great deal of Courier typography in various colors,
lavender (for "ftp://..." hyperlinks), grey, and
yellow.  (To the left-hand side of the typography,
there runs a continuous vertical column:

FT
FT
FT ...)


When clicked, the lavender ftp://... URLS lead to
ebi.ac.uk sites (EBI: the European Bioinformatics
Institute) whose fine print clarifies the name
DROSOPHILIA ("Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly)")
and proceeds to provide the originals for the
grey-and-yellow typography: *"Sequencing the distal X
chromosome" of

a cloned fruit fly.*

The line-by-line genetic information, such as

MNAQQPLILEPGSKASSVVAAAAELEAATTTAALATSSATEASAA

reproduced within the DROSOPHILIA not.art work is
subsequently excerpted to yield the yellow column's
non-existent and English words, as from above:

      LILE  SKA       AELEA            TEA

Thus, the collection of left-hand column "words"
extracted from the fruit fly clone's genetic
information in turn yield the actual boldface English
words:

   SKA       TEA
     GHEE
       VAN

SEAS     SAD DEP

                TIS

                KIDS
           LAP

          GIF FAG

     GAG          ART

RASP LEEK        GIST
       SEA
           AGH

      EH
                  SAG

          MICE

      HA

 GAG
                 LID
  MEDIA

                 SIR            etc.

[The Netscape Navigator browser (but not Internet
Explorer) provides a blinking effect, so that the grey
magma of typography ("MNAQQP...") blinks in and out,
foregrounding the resulting yellow "words" that are
the source of the left-hand column.]


Critically speaking, the "poem" in the yellow
left-hand column, while it may possess a "discoverer"
or interpreter (that is, a preliminary subjective
gleaning of the raw material), literally ~has no
author~ (a kind of "found poetry"). It is "written by"
--- or ~in~ --- the genes of a fruit fly clone, as it
were.


On closer inspection, the remaining un-bolded but
non-English "words" in the yellow column contain many
amusing "near-hits", like typos:

"ANND ... PIC ... MSLF ... ILF ... VIMGES ... LEAPHEP
... GAVYNLY ... LAAAVAAA ... SEVN ... TELEVVNS"

etc.; or curious little "jokes":

"MICE KAT".

Some resemble (or may actually be) words from another
language, such as Thai ("AGPAPANGPATAH"), Arabic
("QAIHL ... QALAL PASAL ... HEILIL AYQALH"),
Carthaginian ("TILKTAL PSEI ... SPAST PIPSPA PEF"), or
Hebrew ("ISYEHAL ... QITIM").

For what it's worth, mind is quicker to abstract design than sense, which

But why haven't backfires fired across the horizon of political
assassinations of yore?  Isn't it inattention, or plethora of "new events"
(much like the sensation line at the poetic horizon) that keep comin' atcha?
  Too much to do; not enough time.  Look at Florida.  The lawsuit

brought by ALL those disenfranchised voters (they have an actual title wch
I've forgotten) has been settled long past, out of court.  Upwards of 95,000
Florida voters were denied the right to vote because they were THOUGHT TO BE
"imprisoned felons" - in name only, ie., had the same name as felons; 91,000
turned out not to be. Part of the deal this group cut

with Miss Katherine Harris, was that those 91,000 votes would be restored to
the rolls . . . in January.  Jeb's got his nose almost over the line by a
razor thin margin in Florida gov. race, so it will be interesting to see the
margin by which he'll win.  At any rate,

evil never wins because it can't create anything but more of itself, which
after a time gets kind of (too) heavy, and that's where we are now, supposed
to be part of an altruistic American effort to haul those sacks of shit
around, the test of patriotism.  It can't last, altho clearly some tea
drinkers and backgammon players living in what's thought to be the cradle of
western civilization are going to pay dearly for being our ancestors.  But
that's the game - exposure and abandonment of population, and assimilation
and control of resource.

But to get back to political assassination (of character), why is it no
one's going after Bush for his Saudi connections through Harken to Caymen
Island/BCCI banking begun in the late eighties via his dad, and in many ways
extending to today?  Bin Laden is small potatoes, and anyway part of the
Bush team.  So is Saddam.  It clearly is not a war on "terrorism" in any but
Popeye spinach terms; the bulk of the current push is as always to reassert
the power of capital over labor.  It's a class war, in which high end
Central Asians are played for allies, and the poor are torn end-for-end by
the chewing verb that gets down to the resources.  Extraction in that sense
isn't local - it's transnational because we in the west still "want" what we
already "are".  Thus, the need.  And of the military running herd on CNN,
etc.

It's all a business war of high-end interests.  Warren Buffett/Bill Gates vs
Big American Oil / tobacco / insurance.  A Ken Starr clone runs the nation,
probably.

Poetics List:

Let me second what Stephen Vincent said a few days back. Two great books
- on discounted special to Poetics - from Chax Press. David - Birthday
Boy - Bromige's AS IN T AS IN TETHER. This one with plenty of David's
great wit. A gorgeous book, from the simple exactly right cover to the
long vertical design which works beautifully with the form of David's
new poems - some of which are very moving, my favorite being "Poem
Reading a Line by Duncan." Yes, get this book. And Tom Mandel's PROSPECT
OF RELEASE. Who the hell says that "innovative" or "experimental" or
"avant garde" poets can't be as full of feeling as them others? Two fine
books, by a press worth supporting.

Here a few selections from the NY Times' four pieces on poetry and poets in
the last two days (during which time the paper also endorsed George Pataki
for governor).  Apparently, to be a Republican is now to be considered a
priori apolitical.

(According to a friend who went to the D.C. anti-war protests this weekend,
the Times, as usual, grossly under-reported the turnout.)

Note the rhetoric of bipartisanship at work in the absolute certitude of the
Hemingwayesque sentences: "His poetry is not political" and "His criticism,
essays and reviews are not polemical."

1. On Dana Gioia (a "calm fit" for the NEA):

At least at first glance, Dana Gioia, who was proposed by the White House
last week, seems to be a shoo-in. He is a writer with a background as a
businessman. He is a registered Republican who voted for George W. Bush and
for his father before that. His poetry is not political. His criticism,
essays and reviews are not polemical. Rather, Mr. Gioia (pronounced JOY-a)
appears to be someone with a wide range of artistic and intellectual
interests who is passionate about making poetry more accessible to the
public.

2. On Albert Mobilio:

Postmodern poets make much of the value of difficulty.  Arcane, fragmentarty
writing encourages active reading, they argue, by forcing the reader to
supply the missing material.  "Thinking becomes the only way out," Creeley
writes in Mobilio's poetry in the same cover blurb.  This is a convenient
stance for poets to take because it acquits them of any responsibility for
the failings of their poems: it's the reader's fault for not working hard
enough.

But the work is thankless, at least in the case of the most radical poetry,
because there's "no stake," as Glyn Maxwell has pointed out, in achieving "a
speculatively coherent rendering of someone else's willed incoherence."

3. "And Bear in Mind":

Mini-Review of Billy Collins' newest book.

4. "New and Noteworthy Paper Backs":

Mini-Review of Billy Collins' selected poems.

Why do all academics and most writers sign their emails "all best"?  I had
never heard this phrase before entering academia/acapoetics.  What does it
mean, and does anyone know who first thought of it?

First thought: Look at that. They're going to talk about a small press
book of poems, albeit by a Whiting fellow, winner of the Balakian prize
from the NBCC... but still!

Second thought: Eric McHenry. Who that? Hmm, Simic interview on The
Atlantic's site, the famous "Auden on Bin Laden" article from Slate last
fall, some mild wisecracks on McSweeney's. Okie doke.

Third thought: He read the same book I did? I seem to remember a long
rambling Joycean narrative by a faded sixties' porn star at the heart of
that book. Also, a true account of failing to pick up the hot neighbor.
There's *some* tricky-to-parse stuff in "Me with Animal Towering", but
mainly it seemed as though Albert was continuing the separate strands from
his gnosticky Coolidgesque chapbook North's True Speed and the tough-guy
prose magician of The Geographics, with more of his walking-around persona
thrown in.

Fourth thought: Pity McHenry! There no literature on Albert to draw from,
the way one does with literary journalism on say Simic or Auden. And how
would he know unless we initiated him how to get to the writers he'd need
to have read to start to get AM: Coolidge, Gizzi, Yau, Olson, Trakl,
Chandler, Cain, Dale Herd.

Fifth thought: Screw McHenry! A google search on Albert Mobilio yields 312
cites, just about all of which point to the man. McHenry had a visible
assignment and couldn't find the cheat sheet in time so he played the
"huh?" card. He quotes AM "working this hand-me-Down abbreviator" and
skips over the echoes of Levine Berryman and Pound in "Thems so
specific... Theys home in a Rising rhythm" -- sounds to me like Albert
isn't "making much of the value of difficulty" but arguing with it, not
ducking the responsibility for the failings of his poems, but all out
mea-culping the reader away! If there's thankless work going on, it's
AM's, who weirdly enough seems to be coming to the same conclusion as the
reviewer, while pointing toward a genre blend more genre than blend as the
way out.

Sixth thought: Screw the Times! Pity the Times! Heckle Pataki! Pity
Mobilio! Send McHenry your books c/o the Times.

Yeah, I first heard it from someone online, I think,

as a supplement to paul stephens's ny times excerpts (in fact i
posted the mchenry excerpt to my classes just yesterday!---as i'm
keeping a weekly tab now of gratuitous anti-postmodernisms), here's
an excerpt from charles mcgrath's final column in the ~book review~
("on writers and writing," p. 31):

"But it's also a novel [Ian McEwan's ~Attonement~] that's infused
with an awareness that novels themselves are provisional, only a
schematic and artificial way of representing an unknowable reality.
This is the great discovery, if you can call it that, of
postmodernism; it's also a truth so obvious that [Cyril] Connolly and
[Elizabeth] Bowan would have thought it went without saying."

don't you just luv this stuff?

best,

I always thought that people should be given numbered placards at
demonstrations so that the press would have to report an accurate #.

Arielle,

Joe and Anastasios backchanneled that they think "all best" is a
contraction of "All the best wishes" or something like that. Joe thinks
it's in wider usage by net-people, and is descended from the tradition of
belles-lettres.

The thing I don't like is getting "all best" as a blanket sign-off to every
email I get from aca-people (or netizens, perhaps).   I get rejections
like; "We didn't think your piece worked for our journal. The next
submission period is in March.  All best, the Editors"   In that context,
such a shorthand is infuriating.  Really-- "all"?  And actually "best"?
Some of what you're telling me is not the best.  Even the cliched "Good
luck placing your work elsewhere" is less offensive.

Often "all best" ends a very flat email, revealing its secretly ironic
agenda.  I greatly prefer a non-cliche sign-off such as "Keep doing your
best" or "It's raining here" or "Word to the mother" or something along
those lines.  How about "ski faster" or "stop spilling noodles" or
something.  Anything to break through the haze!

All best,
Alan Beltz

There are all types of chauvinism involving sense of peoplehood of one sort
or another that lead to discrimination and violence.  Since Jim Crow,
apartheid, and Nazi mass murder, "racism" has become the term with the most
vileness and horror associated with it -- and it's not as if "race" doesn't
infuse nationalism and all the rest.  Zionism is a hybrid, calling upon
nationalism to solve Jewish oppression through colonial utopian
"restoration" which has led to usurpation and wholesale violence with a
distinctly racist quality.  Examine the "colonization" movement in the 19th
century which created Liberia and you'll see a very similar mess -- one in
which freed American slaves (Americo-Liberians) created plantations and
oppressed native Africans in ways similar to the US -- and the US, South
Africa, Liberia, and Israel all had (have), to one degree or another,
despite many differences, a covenantal sensibility infusing the project
(America as the New Jerusalem; Afrikaners actually signed a covenant;
Americo-Liberians as civilizers and converters of Africa; Israel's special
relationship to Palestine, despite trying to have Jews be a "normal"
nation, especially with settlers after 1977).

And perhaps there is a poetics to all of this.

The NY Times almost absolute dismissal of numbers at the DC demonstration -
the CNN web site even reported that it was over a 100,000 and possibly the
largest ever - is mind boggling. Other than being titillated by the vision
of General Tommy Franks as Bush's first "live-in-Iraq" satrap, to my perhaps
limited knowledge, the Times has not expressed an outright editorial
commitment to an invasion (unilateral or otherwise).
So I don't know why they should ignore demonstrations across the country,
nor why they ignore innovative poetry on one hand and, to a degree,  embrace
cutting edge visual arts on the other. (Gallery Ads support the art pages,
where innovative small press ads are mostly non-existent in the Book Review
is perhaps the real answer.)
Where I walked in San Francisco, the visuals (signs), and street theater
were lively and wonderful. A Berkley Bakery collective paraded with raised
Peace symbols made out of baguettes. (I like the idea of eating Peace). Then
there was, "It's Osama, stupid." And finally the most outer-edge placard
read:
Vegan Lesbian
Transgender Punk
Epidemiologist
(With a big red heart painted under the words).

And there was the low key undecipherable chants of small groups of wiccans
under the narrative of political speeches.

And some of the local Channels and the SF Chronicle gave the event good
coverage.

I think the American street is come alive - helpfully driven by Internet
info delivered independent of the big media. To that end I encourage people
to write the NY Times and redirect their blinded attentions. I wrote the
following to the editors, as their web site does invite us:

Dear Editors:
I have appreciated Thomas Friedman's pieces that pay attention - in the case
of an Iraqi invasion -  to the regional, if not also global,  terrorist
perils latent in both the "Arab Street" and "The Arab Basement."
In light of yesterday's enormous cross-country demonstrations against a war
in Iraq, I hope that Mr. Friedman can turn his ear to the "American Street".
It should be clear to anyone that is listening (and clearly this
Administration is not) that the Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld-Wolflitz drive towards
an Iraq war is already faced with a deep internal and popular opposition.
Indeed, I suggest, ignoring this internal opposition will further put this
Administration's Iraqi agenda at risk of an even greater domestic rebellion
and disaster.
Thank you,
Stephen Vincent

David Buuck & Dan Farrell

Prose hybridist, musician, critic, and editor David Buuck is the author of up
the flagpoles (Melodeon Poetry Systems, 1999). His creative work has appeared
in Narrativity, Object, and Arras; critical work in Jouvert: A Journal of
PostColonial Studies, Outlet, Research in African Literatures and Traffic. He
is one of the founding editors of Tripwire, a journal of poetics, a West Coast
venue for literary, artistic, and political discussions and intersections in
our time. He has been an Artist-in-Residence at Headlands Center for the Arts
and is currently studying in the History of Consciousness Program at UC Santa
Cruz.

Dan Farrell?s many books include The Inkblot Record (Coach House Press, 2001),
(Untitled Epic Poem on the History of Industrialization by R. Buckminster
Fuller, pp. 1-50) Grid (Meow Press, 1999), and Last Instance (Krupskaya,
1999), which Nancy Shaw says "poses the relations between social reproduction
and expression through stuttering, mocking, and sutured acts of composition.
[Farrell?s] poetic strategies clash and mingle with the social instigating
transpositions at the level of the letter, syntactical order, and semantic
sensibility." Originally from British Columbia, Farrell currently lives in San
Francisco.

All events are $5-10, sliding scale, unless otherwise noted. Our events are
free to SPT members, and CCAC faculty, staff, and students.
Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in

Easy Bake and Shake


Oh how smurfy things once were
                    how Might we once
                    again get Smurfy?

Past bizzare disasters and Our freakouts

Overreact to All riots and Lying, while
            secretly *Thrilled* with the juice
              from these Dangers

You've slept with your therapist, I've slept
             with Your therapist, and the
             pizza guy

But what's important is Growing old Quickly

Get kinetic in your descriptions, Feet
                  filled with quicksand,
                  concrete, hydrogen

Spill out into the streets to Placate

      Take candy and Advice from
      the strangest

Propelled forward By their willingness
                     to sow Confusion

The pyros have left us Alone, while
          the town Blooms to a
            Regal crisp and Bake-off

Feel my hands, and your hands, that
           Guy's hands all climbing

Onto places you never knew you
                              Possessed

Jump to a paralyzing Conclusion
                     for once, Break Apart

and Be glued to another perfect
Match  Nothing from here down

Go Ask


I like you better as a Pixilated
                  nightmare

Shine on you crazy Shepherd,
            and carry your minions
            once again Away from
                   Thorns

And toward misdemeanors

Bring all your pals to Hear the
               cranky Senator twirl

Mascara clouds your edge, trickling
                into think Tanks
                and forums that

Respond viciously to androgynies

Acts of War feel naughtier than
                they have in Years

sorry, it's a secret, How to become
                     this Empowered

the *skills* required to break Thru
                with Cheerleaders

And unconscious transactions of Lust
summon Shouts and whistles

Elsewhere in barren towns Integrity
                    plays in double
                    Features

Fuck it all to Hell, if that's an option

Or breeze through the Calmest of States

You have forgotten how to Dance and sing
                            such a Shame
To repel Hosts          Praise the Horde

Anthony, are you okay?

This was kind of scary -- and possibly a little creepy -- but I'm guessing
it's meant to be a what, a -- tender? homage??

Kevin,

One publisher I can think of who has some experience with this is Lyn
Hejinian -- I remember a conversation with her about Atelos seeking
permission from Jim Jarmusch and Johnny Depp to use a still from "Dead Man=
"
for the cover of Jean Day's book=2E (If I recall correctly, pricing had
something to do with the fact that the cover shows the back of Depp's head=

rather than a frontal or profile shot, but I could be wrong on that)=2E

Leslie Scalapino also used a photo of a Joseph Cornell box on the cover of=

Lisa Samuels' book, but I don't know how similar the permissions process i=
s
for art reproductions as compared to film stills=2E

 AGNI Magazine to celebrate 30th Anniversary
on Wednesday, October 30th, 8:00 p.m., at Boston University with
readings by 14 prominent poets, including Nobel Laureate Seamus
Heaney and ex-U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky, plus a special 30th
Anniversary Anthology.

On Wednesday, October 30th at 8:00 p.m. at Boston University's
Metcalf Center (590 Commonwealth Ave., Rm. 107; Green Line T: Kenmore
or Blandford St. stops; entrance on right side of building), AGNI
Magazine will celebrate its 30th anniversary--as well as the changing
of the guard in editors as Sven Birkerts takes over from Founding
Editor Askold Melnyczuk--with a reading by fourteen local poets
including William Corbett, Diana Der-Hovanessian, Stuart Dischell,
Sharon Dunn, Michael Franco, Seamus Heaney, Fred Marchant, Gail
Mazur, Dzvinia Orlowsky, Robert Pinsky, David Rivard, Lloyd Schwartz,
Tom Sleigh, and, last but certainly not least, Rosanna Warren.

Cost is $15 ($5 with student ID).  All are welcome.

Also available at the reading, at a discounted price, will be AGNI
56, a 480-page anthology of some of the best poetry in AGNI since its
inception in 1972.  The last edited by Founding Editor Melnyczuk, the
issue will include one poem by each of 243 poets (a number of them
translations), among them Derek Walcott, Seamus Heaney, Wislawa
Szymborska, Joseph Brodsky, Adrienne Rich, Odysseas Elytis, Rita
Dove, Eugenio Montale, and Ai.  Fronted by an original lithograph by
Ellen Driscoll, AGNI 56 comprises a landmark compendium of the energy
and scope of American poets and translators over the past three
decades.

The occasion also marks the informal and unofficial "passing of the
torch" from Melnyczuk to new Editor Birkerts, renowned literary
critic and author of numerous books, including the seminal The
Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age as well
as a new memoir, My Sky Blue Trades: Growing up Counter in a Contrary
Time.

For further information, or to inquire about a special fundraising
cocktail party with the poets prior to the reading, contact Managing
Editor Eric Grunwald at (617) 353-7135.

I share the feeling that McHenry's review relies too much on a few stock responses intended to reassure the complacent, but I think it should be pointed out that it does contain praise, too.  More importantly, he quotes at some length and includes both "good" and "bad" specimens, which means that he wants to give his readers a chance to see for themselves.  This is something that Poetics-List-style reviewers generally do not do often enough -- maybe because they themselves don't know which lines are good and bad in a given book.

I also question these assertions by Jordan Davis (while agreeing with him in general):

>Second thought: Eric McHenry. Who that?

Who cares?  The review is stimulating or it isn't.  We don't need to ask for his credentials.

>Fourth thought: Pity McHenry! There no literature on Albert to draw from,
>the way one does with literary journalism on say Simic or Auden. And how
>would he know unless we initiated him how to get to the writers he'd need
>to have read to start to get AM: Coolidge, Gizzi, Yau, Olson, Trakl,
>Chandler, Cain, Dale Herd.

Don't writers deserve to be read -- and evaluated -- on their own terms?  If I were a partisan of Gioia, let's say, I could make a similar charge: you haven't been initiated into Merrill, Howard, Hollander, Hecht, Seth, Steele, etc., etc. -- so you just don't get it.  No one should dictate who counts as an "informed" reviewer -- often the uninformed do the best job.

>Fifth thought: Screw McHenry! A google search on Albert Mobilio yields 312
>cites, just about all of which point to the man. McHenry had a visible
>assignment and couldn't find the cheat sheet in time so he played the
>"huh?" card.

"Huh?" should worry poets more than it does.  The reason it doesn't is that too many readers are afraid to say it: they prefer the kind of knowing silence that visitors to modern art museums cloak their incomprehension in.

>Send McHenry your books c/o the Times.

Not a bad idea -- but also give Dana Gioia's book a serious review in the next issue of Jacket.  Dismissal-in-lieu-of-analysis cuts both ways.

have returned the soul, he is our friend, he is so very good -

he will save many others, i will help him, i restore his eyes,
they are full of life, they love -

i restore his hearing, he will hear his plans have been dismissed,
his world is a world of peace, i release him from every prison -

i feed and nourish him, make him a comfortable place to live and sleep,
offer him the best of drink and food, he flourishes with my kindness -
i will be his servant, i will bring him back to life, i will help him -

just as he has helped others, his kindness knows no bounds, everything
about him speaks of good -

he has given us our lives and our humanity, he eliminates evil and
corruption everywhere in the world, he speaks in the name of humility and
perfection, i will restore his speech, heal him, i will sooth him,
make myself useful unto him -

this is a man, this is an unknown man who worketh miracles -

and the Beats stuff....mostly I like this poet but this looks "disturbed"
...maybe I dont know enough. Or hepoet was drinking and reading Dante's
"Inferno". Richard Taylor.

So it's down to my shirt, is it? My shirt is what I lost when Bromelius
and Blowfly sold me that worthless language poetry claim in the Yukon.
That's why they go on and on about philosophers whose names they cannot
spell.

Well, wake up and smell the maple syrup. As quick as you can say "John
George Diefenbaker" there'll be guys in red serge tunics and Stetsons at
the door. And the only shirts for B&B will be striped ones.

Gabe--now, now...are you trying to provoke discussion
of your ass and poems containing it--are you simply
stirring the pot, so to speak?  Your backchannel to me
seemed, if not approving, cordial enough.  But the
accusation that I am "disturbed" seems rather odd
coming from a man who writes poems about a peacock's
rectum and poems that implore the return of his butt.

In any case, last Friday, I sat down in a comfy chair
and read your book.  All the poems about asses got me
thinking about what it would be like if Gabe Gudding
lived inside an ass...in this case, mine.  And I
always like to put Kent Johnson in my poems whenever
possible. I assure you (and you too, Richard) that I
am fine.  Kent Johnson found it rather
funny...admittedly, I didn't suggest that he was in my
ass...I merely suggested that he liked to drink
martinis.

So, if harm was done, I apologize...but I'm a tad bit
puzzled at being labeled "disturbed."  And no, I was
neither drunk nor reading Dante at the time I composed
the poem.  I was sober, it was mid-day, and I had just
finished reading some rousing good and funny Gudding
poems.

And yes, Gabe, you might call it an homage...Tender?
Nah.  But you were the inspiration.


Best,
Tony

hey kevin,

yes, atelos used a still from jim jarmusch's film dead man for jean
day's book, _the literal world_. if i remember correctly, we contacted
jim jarmusch's office and told them what we wanted to do with the still
-- i.e. we wanted to put it on the cover of the book. they were really
great about it and actually sent us one of their (big)  laser discs for
us to pull the still from. first, though, we had to contact johnny depp
and ask his permission too. we were put in contact with johnny's
personal assistant, bruce. he was very nice too. everyone agreed that we
could use the image of the back of johnny depp's head for the sole
purpose of printing it on the cover. we had to agree not to use any
other images from the film or of johnny depp. our "payment" to both
johnny depp and jim jarmusch was two copies of the book to each of them.
that was their request.

we get permission for all the images we use on our covers actually.
generally it's pretty easy, and most people are very agreeable. i think
the only time we actually had to pay someone to use an image was when we
used the great rodchenko photograph that is on the cover of leslie
scalapino's book _r-hu_. some museum in germany  owns the photo that we
used and charged us about $100 -- i think.

so, i'd suggest getting in touch with 20th century fox and seeing who
handles permissions over there. i imagine it will work out rather nicely
for you.

good luck,
travis

When I was first planning my wish list of
contributors/poems for the new e-journal LOGOPOEIA

(http://www.logopoeialogopoeia.da.ru/ ,

in case people were already off to the Hamptons for
the summer in June when it was premiered,--- with
significant "coups" such as the first published poetry
of Greta Garbo-vanished PCOET poet David Melnick seen
in 20 years [introduction by Ron Silliman],
revisionist poems surpressed from the Sun & Moon final
book version of Standard Schaefer's ~Nova,~ etc.),

Jim Jarmusch's poems were at the top of the list.  In
specific, two poems by him printed in a mid-'70s
Columbia Review.  Jarmusch was at that time a student
at Columbia College in New York City.

People attending the Kenneth Koch memorial at the St.
Mark's Poetry Project at the beginning of this month,
for those who didn't know, may have been surprised to
see Jarmusch as one of those invited to offer
recollections.  He was a student of Kenneth's, and has
maintained good contact with his other former teacher,
David Shapiro: I've seen Jarmusch show up for a
reading of David's in The Village.  I'm told that he
always invited Kenneth to his premieres.

Jarmusch is a couple of years older than me ---I think
he was a senior when I was a freshman or sophomore---
although I don't recall our ever speaking.  He was,
though, close pals with another (then) Columbia poet
(gone on to later literary notoriety, shall remain
unnamed) of a very precocious ~Tel Quel~-savvy
variety,--- so there was a sort of
erudition-by-association about him.  (I'm not sure how
talkative he is, actually [You know those Walking
Eyeball cinematographers]: from a distance, he seems
softspoken-verging-on-shy; at the Koch memorial, since
there were no front row seats remaining, he was
positioned off to the front left, almost parallel to
the stage, in a somewhat embarassingly conspicuous and
well-lit spot, and he sat there waiting for things to
begin as though he were patiently in a laundromat,
content, expressionless, almost immobile, no
twitching, until someone would come up to him raving
and interrupt his tranquility.  Throughout the entire,
lengthy ---almost two hour?--- memorial, he sat in
profile like that, reacting to very little.  But media
celebrity does instill a certain self-possession in
many.

In the late '70s, he was still around the
neighborhood, and I used to see him sitting at the
counter in a West 90s diner, in the Golden Age of New
York 24-hour breakfast specials, the overall
~noir~-ness of that period, and other ~auteur~-ish New
York-isms of the time, such as the now bygone
transsexual population in the West 90s and upper 80s.
He was already impressive for his mane of prematurely
white hair, and perhaps that in-profile fixity that I
still find in him was showing.

Anyway,--- the Columbia Review poems, entitled ~Nature
Mort~ and ~Five Bagatelles,~ are definite worth
reading and re-publishing.  Certainly out of anyone's
curiosity about that ---lost?--- side of a famous film
director, but also because the poems were good and,
not only good, record a particular, forgotten phase of
literary history.  As David Shapiro lamented in his
recent ~Rain Taxi~ interview (subsequently rebutted in
Ron Silliman's blog), the subsequent dominance of
Language Poetry has "disappeared" a great deal of what
went on in the New York School, that in fact
prefigured, outright staked out in advance with
proprietary rights, or ---outdid?  People don't seem
to realize how freely and for how long "this stuff"
has been in circulation, nor, in a sense, how ~easily
acquired~ it was.  Surely the hand-picked students in
Kenneth's Imaginative Writing workshop represented an
unusually "gifted"/privileged Knights of the Round
Table back then, so that Jarmusch or his
contemporaries could not be considered "just anyone"
who had somehow bought The Lamp of Inspiration
cheaply,--- but a review of such student work from
that period (and locale) would show a much higher
level of sophistication and progressiveness than is
generally assumed.  Plus ca change.

Jarmusch's poems may demonstrate some of those
tendencies, too, by way of a sort of Darwinian
adaptational fluke of poetry, whereby a great deal
that later seemed "Language" but that came between
that and New York School in fact got that way simply
via being able to read French and those generations'
precedence: "Five Bagatelles" in some ways resembles,
for example, Picabia's Dada poetry; "Nature Mort", for
the way it defuses various sentimental paraphernalia
and, perhaps, too vivid a reading of Stevens, is
interesting too for the way it contains a walk-on
cameo character who enters stage direction/film
script-like ("entered the room") to speak in quotation
marks --- a sort of harbinger of his later
script-writing propensities?

At any rate, Jarmusch's assistant, tracked down via
California via New York, declined permission. ---So I
still don't feel at liberty to quote or re-type the
two poems here on-List.  (You never know "who's
watching.") It's a pity.  He underestimated the value
of both his early writing and the significance it
would have for his admirers and for readers of poetry.

---I might add: regardless of where it might have fit
into a phantasmatic literary history that I've badly
sketched, poems like his at the time, and to a good
extent still, seemed utterly inscrutable.  It's
difficult to convey the ~bafflement~ that was
engendered by progressive poetry back then, even among
the well-read.  Since then, we've become numb or
habituated to most of it, or have developed new
sensory organs that can handle these microwaved
frequencies.  At the time, it was extremely uncommon
and in short supply and nothing prepared a reader for
being left totally in the dark by perfectly familiar
words.

hey kevin,

  yes, atelos used a still from jim jarmusch's film
dead man for jean
  day's book, _the literal world_. if i remember
correctly, we contacted
  jim jarmusch's office and told them what we wanted
to do with the still
  -- i.e. we wanted to put it on the cover of the
book. they were really
  great about it and actually sent us one of their
(big)  laser discs for
  us to pull the still from. first, though, we had to
contact johnny depp
  and ask his permission too. we were put in contact
with johnny's
  personal assistant, bruce. he was very nice too.
everyone agreed that we
  could use the image of the back of johnny depp's
head for the sole
  purpose of printing it on the cover. we had to agree
not to use any
  other images from the film or of johnny depp. our
"payment" to both
  johnny depp and jim jarmusch was two copies of the
book to each of them.
  that was their request.

  we get permission for all the images we use on our
covers actually.
  generally it's pretty easy, and most people are very
agreeable. i think
  the only time we actually had to pay someone to use
an image was when we
  used the great rodchenko photograph that is on the
cover of leslie
  scalapino's book _r-hu_. some museum in germany
owns the photo that we
  used and charged us about $100 -- i think.

  so, i'd suggest getting in touch with 20th century
fox and seeing who
  handles permissions over there. i imagine it will
work out rather nicely
  for you.

  good luck,
  travis

being a minnesotan and having wellstone's aid's wife as your dept account,
maria, you probably already know that wellstone was once previously
associated with a possible assassination attempt, this during his visit to
Colombia in December of 2000:

http://www.counterpunch.org/pipermail/counterpunch-list/2000-December/004162.html

http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/colombia001201.html


it wouldnt surprise me in the least if wellstone was assassinated.
Conspiracy and America are almost synonymous. something douglas barbour
used to put in his signatures always stuck with me: "Violence can only be
concealed by a lie, and the lie can only be maintained by violence. Any man
who has once proclaimed violence as his method is inevitably forced to take
the lie as his principle. - Alexander Solzhenitsyn"   gg

Aaron, Arielle, Jordan--

I always liked the non-academic closing statement of "Eat Poop"
but that created too many dissentions & declensions so I've used
the statement below for at least a decade with only two problems.
I think one can be found in the poetix archives in the mid-nineties.

Also, I never heard back from you Arielle, & if anyone else sent me an
e-mail & has not heard back-- sometime last month our server lost a lot
of messages.

Be well

Louis, Stephan,

Beethoven suggests a conflictually inter-related structure of his
symphonies to the score in his later work; they are not the same but
related and I take these relations to be Olson's point, his gist. The
score of writing is not usually seen as so unreproduceable tho, hence
the problem, the common, please excuse my humor, house organ of speech,
not being understood for the strata it really occupies. I see Olson as
believing, as you say Louis, that "any scoring is already an attempted
performance" with one minor exclusion, punctuation as the score of the
breath.

This is the part I do not understand, why does Olson use the whole page
as score, shifting things typographically about on the page, but then
ignores the measure each punctive mark makes.  For example, a "score"
(i.e. poem) where a comma gets one beat,  a period four, a double dash
gets X, and so on. Therefore my conclusion & what I am offering or
suggesting is that the organ analogous to Beethoven's "ear" (which is
really outside the realm of the score, ie: showing a time change
signature which can only occur on the written page )that Olson does not
"need," corresponds to the "breath" a measure also beyond the realm of
the page.  Merce Cunningham created a similar quandry (i.e. a
"beyond-the-page" vector) when he attempted to score dance and so did
Chistopher Alexander (the architect) two people I found my reading
heading toward & before I concluded with a grand book called The RSVP
cycle.

Be well

A hypnosis of waves and exchange of breaks a reluctance of surgery and =

the depth measured in fathoms or marked with lines or rods but not, as =
its opposite, measured unbelievably with balloons and all this in a =
breeze? Yes. Yes. Almost an involuntary. Turn up the auscultation and =
listen harder then. The silenus approaches disguised in =
cairngorn-dark-blue reproaches the natural causes and before you know it =
a resounding parhelion has this hostility in from the cuithes to glinder =
a-boot, a-boot. The sheer on the ear identifies them. Seven lang and =
seven short and flies the scotty-fool  past the sound crowded around =
provoking almost something resembling a borderline dawnuppance. And over =
there the two swans. Well and well again, you say: good morning.

but andrew, here's the diff:  i know very well gioia's work, and the
work of his ilk, let's say... i have to, not least b/c you won't get
7440+ hits when you do a google search for my name (unless you get
confused with the top fuel racer named joe amato)... i mean, gioia's
little diatribe "can poetry matter?" (published in ~the atlantic
monthly~ back when i was in grad school) got more circulation than
any 100 treatises by the poets on this list... and, pardon me, but
what a half-assed diatribe it was...

problem is, gioia and most like him don't know about *my* ilk...
sorry, but i've been through it a zillion times before... tobias
wolff?---great writer i think... but so is ron sukenick... and the
problem becomes one having to do with said mainstreamed
("successful") writers and what they think they can "afford" not to
know about what else is out there (i.e., if they think about it at
all)... whereas most who are not part of the latter club have to know
both sides of the divide...

i'm sure my explicit dichotomy will cause some alarm among the
ranks... but there are times it's worth drawing a line in the sand,
and this is one of those times... i would go so far as to say that
there's an analog here with race issues---i would say e.g. that
african americans have to know more about whites than whites have to
know about african americans (yes, here in the u.s. ca. 2002)...
maybe this will change someday...

but in any case, i've enjoyed more social occasions than i can
recount here in which Famous Writer whose work i know and admire has
no idea of the texts that have been a formative part of my education
as a poet... which situation is generally replete with implicit
putdowns of my tradition (i'm going out of my way here to come off as
possessive, yes)... the more humble Famous Writers are ok about
this---e.g., i can remember a yale younger poet confiding in me that
s/he had no knowledge of most of williams's ~kora in hell~ etc etc
etc... pretty astonishing really, as the gaps were, again, of a
particular lit tradition (i.e., and to say it boldly again,
*mine*)---which of course, and as you'd expect, resulted in a
particular kind of yale younger poetry... i have all sortsa gaps in
my knowledge mself, but i mean, like, not of this order, no fucking
way...

and in this regard, i suppose the first rule is that word you used in
a prior post, andrew---humility... as to incentives, i have every
marketplace incentive to know what i'm up against, whereas those to
whom i'm making reference contra do not, setting aside some of them
potentially developing an awareness of something akin to a symposium
of the whole (can you imagine?)... we're not talking the value of abc
poetry, either, we're talking the way said value is/is not
established, by whom, where, and how often... and i don't think,
though john tranter can certainly wax more eloquent than i about
this, that ~jacket~ need feel obliged to cover the same poets who get
covered in any number of major news venues...

best,

joe

Peter Quartermain retired in 1999 from UBC, where he taught contemporary
poetry and poetics for over thirty years. In addition to writing
Disjunctive Poetics: from Gertrude Stein and Louis Zukofsky to Susan Howe
(1992), and Basil Bunting: Poet of the North (1990), he edited four volumes
on American Poets 1880-1945 for the Dictionary of Literary Biography
(1986-7), and two anthologies: Other British and Irish Poetry since 1970
with Richard Caddel (Wesleyan UP, 1998) and The Objectivist Nexus: Essays in
Cultural Poetics (U of Alabama P, 1999) with Rachel Blau DuPlessis. He has
published about seventy articles and essays on poets writing in English. He
most recently interrupted the writing of his autobiography Where I Lived and
What I Learned For: Part I -- Growing Dumb, with a brief stint conducting a
workshop at the Naropa Summer Writing Program in Boulder, Colorado. He is
married to the poet Meredith Quartermain. They ran Slug Press (now defunct)
and are currently setting up Keefer Street Press, for limited-edition
letter-press work.

Charles Tonderai Mudede is a native of Zimbabwe who has lived in Seattle

Hi. This offer features free shipping/handling to List members.  And if you
enclose a poem with any order, take 20% off the retail price because, at
Meritage Press, we believe a poem has value.  Ordering information below:

===================

Meritage Press is pleased to announce the release of

er, um
Poems by Garrett Caples
Drawings by Hu Xin
Meritage Press
ISBN: 0-9709179-1-0


er, um is a collection of ten poems by Garrett Caples, together with six
drawings by Hu Xin, published by Meritage Press in a handsome limited edition
of 75 copies for trade.  Each copy is signed and numbered by the author.  The
poems include a lyric ode to "China," homages to Philip Lamantia and Barbara
Guest, the prose of "Turd Factory," and an "Elegy for George Harrison."
Learn fascinating tidbits like "Alexander Graham Bell wanted to call/ his
daughter Photophone" and "the iraqi oud players did not initiate/ this
conflict."  "Imagine a town with no numbers."  See "stone lions/ accost
drunken clowns dressed as priests" and "evergreen cypresses/ form the/
appropriate image/ of death."  er, um also marks the first publication of Hu
Xin's graphic work, made specifically for this volume.  All this and more,
for the princely price of a sawbuck ($10).

Garrett Caples is a poet living in Oakland, CA.  er, um is his first
collection of poems since The Garrett Caples Reader (Black Square Editions
1999), which Publisher's Weekly found "straddling the line between a Syd
Barrett stream-of-sweet-nothings and the bachelor-machine eroticism of
Duchamp."  Previous volumes include The Dream of Curtains, burr, Five
Drawings by Brian Lucas (for which he supplied text), and synth.  Of his
work, the poet Jeff Clark was once heard to say: "Caples is a polymath.  He
is, in no particular order, an essayist (he's published long, sometimes
notorious evaluations of Barbara Guest, Will Alexander, John Yau, Joe
Brainard, Barrett Watten, Eliot Weinberger, Charles Bernstein, among others);
with his partner Anna Naruta he's the maker of films, documentaries, music
videos; with Naruta he's also the publisher of Kolourmeim Press; recently he
produced a cd of boogified electronica entitled Lee Marvin; he's fashioned
liner notes for a handful of indie rock albums; he's a scholar of Joyce and
of Stein; more interestingly, he's a connoisseur of hip-hop; he's a love
poet, photographer, and collage-maker.  His erotica has been anthologized.
He's at work on an interview with Shock-G of Digital Underground.  He's been
and likely will remain, as long as he's here--or there--a student of radical
Oakland politics and culture."

Hu Xin is a painter living in Beijing.  Though trained from an early age in
the techniques of traditional Chinese painting--his father and grandfather
were both successful artists--he most often works in what in China is a
comparatively recent field, oil painting on canvas.  He has studied painting
in China and Japan, where, as a graduate student, we began to absorb some
Western influences.  In particular, he was drawn to Dali's paranoiac-critical
method, though "his own repeated attempts to fuse the essence of traditional
Chinese painting and realistic oil painting brought about a distinct
technique."  Hu Xin makes extensive use of transparency, complicating the
relationship between figure and ground while suggesting other planes
intersecting surface reality.  The result is a neo-surrealism that--given the
paucity of material on surrealism written in or translated into Chinese--may
be considered self-won, product of his own belief that "artistic skill should
be primarily in the service of the mind," rather than simple assimilation or
imitation of Western art.

<< Bill. Its probably ultimtely a class question, but of course, its who and

what one reads, one's own personality: degree of political "nous" and so on.

people we know for example become strongly religious because their parents

were: others reject religion for the same reason.  Most people are

influenced by their parents ..but there are many other influences. John

Geraets in the ..can I call it "innovative" NZ mag?.... has recently

explained his aesthetics: interesting as that "explantion is" one suspects

that Geraets likes being "in aporia" and moving with the moment's ever

expanding bubble... (and some of my own writing moves in directions loosely

of a similar kind of philosophic: if not being anything like Geraets's work

in texture)...and in fact about 1994 I "liked to think" that I didnt need to

think about politics, and to some extent it was my "discovery" of the

Language Poets that "incited" or excited me to look at the politico-social

aspects of language practice, and perhaps that is ironic or paradoxical

...or to at least become aware of the link so to speak...but around that

time I was more attracted to what I suppose was  or could have become a sort

of elitist aesthetic: the poetry that most interested me (and a lot of it

still does) was not predicated on any presuppositions, and required poets to

be extremly well read if not PhDs (or at least very interested in poetics

etc) -  I was interested in the innovation and experimentation and the

"crazy stuff" for "individualist" political reasons I suppose. I had done

some political satrical work and some vaguely Ashberic stuff but was wanting

to move toward a "higher" poetic/poetry......and at that time I contributed

to a small mag called Salt (NZ) which Scott Hamilton and Hamish Dewe

published... and at that time (about 1994) one of Scott's tenets was that

they were having "no political correctness"....I was attracted to this

semi-anarchistic approach ...but at various times in my life, "life" such as

the fact that I have three children, and now a grand child, impinges on my

work...and even here there is no escaping the effects that S11- more Life -

Lfe of Dream? - or Trauma? - had on us here even in NZ (where we all of

course  have televisions) so if it was a CIA stunt it was pretty spectacular

and effective one: my initial reaction Bill was in fact very pro a kind of

Bush one as some strange events had preceded it....I had met an Iraqi the

day or so before (who was actually Babylonian) ...then I had my friend who

is (he disagrees quite strongly by the way with me we've had some real crazy

arguments, he thinking that the Muslim extremists are the bad guys and so

on) but in a library I had met an older American women and somewhow the

question of  refugees (maybe I mentioned the fact that I had actually met a

Babylonian and thought she'd be interested in that) coming here was raised:

she raised the "terrorist" spectre, calling (people in the Middle East )

"hot blooded, then I had some strong words about recent US history, then

she: "So you're anti,eh?" and so on. But then my friend  suggested that

someof the people coming here could be potential terroists...now, nowadays I

think that that is possible but not important: and a day or so after those

encounters "whammo!" I wake up to a phone call from my son wanting me to

turn the TVon and there it is: towers bursting in the violet air and the

whole thing surreal and strange and then I sent an email wanting to wipe out

all the Arabs...but I changed my position...I started to think more calmly

and I became "suspicioned" of Bush and the BBC and so on. Charles Bernstein

did those quite excellent "reports", and I did a lot of probably a bit crazy

"raving"...so the whole fireworks display of S11 has polarised and

politicised or re-politicised people throughout the world.....and as you

imply, where one stands is often what one likes to think for various complex

reasons.


 Regards, Richard. >>

I enjoy posts that focus on the issue at hand, but also reach out to involve
everything else that has been going on for a while.  Thanks for this overview
of your evolution/development, Richard.  Best, Bill

!Factorial Press is pleased to announce:

        [Two] Factorial--Call for Work

Please refer to the first issue, [One] Factorial, to see how some writers
and artists have approached collaboration. While we are excited by the
range of collaborative projects in the first issue, we hope the work and
discussions included in it offer themselves more as points of proliferation
than models to be emulated.

        [One] Factorial is available for $6:
        (payable to Sawako Nakayasu; but correspondence must be addressed to
!Factorial Press.)

        !Factorial Press
        PO Box 153106
        San Diego, CA  92195-3106.

        http://www.factorial.org


Possibilities:

-->  Any work that responds to or engages with the discussions in part two
of [One] Factorial is particularly welcome;

-->  Any submissions of work that uses a title from Keith Waldrop's _Titles
for Sale_ should enclose $2/title, in a check made out to Keith Waldrop;

-->  A collaborative process does not always have to be collaboratively
"generative," but can be "degenerative" (Example: Keith and Rosmarie
Waldrops' "Words Worth Less," a collaboration where they began with a
Wordsworth poem and alternated removing words from the original and each
other's pared down offerings);

-->  And as usual: plays, performance text, transcriptions, instructions,
narrative, conversations, essays, poems, definitions, manifestos,
incidental text, and various combinations thereof;

-->  OR descriptions, ideas, processes, proposals, possible & impossible
imaginings of collaborative projects for the (Collaborating [On)
Collaborating] section.

--> Note: the main focus of the journal is still text-collaborations,
although we welcome work that also engages with the musical, visual,
temporal, and performative.

-->  Electronic collaborations will be considered for publication on the
website.


Please send 1 to 15 pages of hard copy.

Send *two* copies of all submissions to:

!Factorial Press
Sawako Nakayasu & Mark Tardi, Editors
516 N. Main Street, Apt.3

Hello all,

I'm in the process of beginning to go through a dj training program at a
local college station, hoping to start a poetry program: readings, author
interviews, discussions etc. The station broadcasts via the web and I'm
wondering if anyone knows of other programs like this? does any one do a
show focused on poetry??? web cast??? any info will help...

thanks,
noah

Joe writes, "the gaps were, again, of a particular lit tradition (i.e., and
to say it boldly again,*mine*)---which of course, and as you'd expect,
resulted in a particular kind of yale younger poetry"

and Bob writes "> Canadian poetry = New American Poetry minus the NY School.
Why?

Sounds dumb.  Probably the best Canadian poets, perhaps inspired by bp
Nichol, have been visual and sound poets, and that ain't New American
Poetry.  I rather suspect there are also NY School Canadian poets, too."

and Carles Bernstein posts his Poetry "Experiments" (cited as paradigm,
albeit limited, rather than as mischance or bobble)

all in one day if on different lists.

the experiments seem to be limited to linguistic and rational play?

descartes' error may have been one of vision limited to the ratonal and this
has been magnified by Western civilization into a vision in which warfare is
seen as the only way of asserting existence.

the esay way out is to negate the 'i'

but what of i FEEL, i SEE, i HEAR, i AM IN PAIN?

and content?

kind of like a Rorschach test of poetics - despite cultural myths to the
contrary the test used diagnostically has little to do with content but with
style, anguage, form, etc.

guess I've shot off my load for the day.

equilibrium, Virginia. The staggering correspondence of treasure. An old =
master

stored there where you left it. There is a build up of sand, something =
about tides, currents and barriers. And the concrete of blocks. Didn't =
really understand this by-the-way explanation but naturally flummoxed =
and apparently worked out a fabrication that satisfies the way it =
revolves. Almost like the world, wouldn't you say? Staggering. Almost =
like the world as though the squares within circles and the way his arms =
stretch out. The diagonals. The background.=20

The chart. By way of interaction? Or prediction. His eyes were deep =
light-blue corresponding and/or contrasting to a dark green shirt he =
then wore, his lion's beard the last to go in chemical reaction. Full of =
life until the transition. Almost the way Bach had so many children, a =
fugue of them setting the pace for the long distance runner. Running =
into the long distance. Staying the course. The marathon space.

You can see the faint outline of a Wheel? Was it or maybe is that the =
one?=20

Ezequiel held no answer to the question at all. None at all, but she =
heard it nonetheless and it tolls, sometimes taking its toll, sometimes =
a comfort, the way one finds remittance in symbols, a pittance not quite =
understood, but there just for the mystery of it. The way children break =
out in festivals of firecrackers and subversively chant, hookah tookah =
my soda cracker, three six nine the goose drank wine. The hurried genius =
of outstretched arms reaching toward? And mirrored by his legs =
outstretched, pinned to the map? Nailed to a wheel? Pity that she =
couldn't see it, he said so, made that plain, but knows only that the =
wheel was great and wonders if. Covered in Chinese explosives and/or =
ablaze. The days swift as the weaver's shuttle and spent. But dragging =
along any old which way the thoughts wander, run across the encounter, =
still runs the gauntLets go off at the mouth. Listen to tauntLet it be =
for a while. Presuppose benediction, preface inscription, shiver your =
timbers, hang from the rafters and rush at the fences.



And all this from the old master. Oh, you, Leonardo, you and your =
mystery man. Your charcoal, her mystery, her man. Pinned to a map? A =
wheel? A target, revolving?



Her beautiful, bearded old man, da Vinci, pinned to your paper and =
compassed, encompassed around as though navigation might help him spin =
wheels and begs you:=20

Please don't throw that knife.=20

Let the wheel turn, turn, let it revolve but=20

don't throw that knife.

There used to be (still is?) a show on Columbia's WKCR 89.9 FM New York
station, Sundays either at 8 or 8:30, called "Composed on the Tongue." I
tried tried tried to change the name when I ran it, but because it was
from an Allen Ginsberg poem they insisted.

BAI used to broadcast radio plays, some of which were in verse.

And there was the show Kenneth Sherwood use to run at UB, Linebreak.

Hello Everybody,

I received the message below from CARFAC and checked, and sure enough
had the file, which I got rid of as directed.  This is my first
experience with a virus.  I'll leave it to you, of course, whether you
want to do the same.

Otherwise, have a good day!

Don


I just received this e-mail from a contact, and yes, I did find this
virus,
it was easy to get rid of please follow the directions below, sorry for
the
inconvenience and raising of blood pressure.

Subject: Possible Virus
Date: Wed, 2 Oct 2002 12:15:39 -0400
A Virus has been passed on to me. My address book had in turn been
infected.
Since you are in my address book, there is a good chance you will find
it
in your computer too.
If so follow the directions below and eradicated the virus easily.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
The Virus (called jdbgmgr.exe) is not detected by Norton or McAfee
anti-virus systems.
The virus sits quietly for 14 days before damaging the system.
It is sent automatically by messenger and by the address book, whether
or not you sent emails to your contacts.
Here's how to check for the virus and how to get rid of it. YOU MUST DO
THIS
1. Go to Start, Find or Search option
2. In the file/folders option, type the name: jdbgmgr.exe
3. Be sure you search your C: drive and all sub-folders and any other
drives you may have.
4. Click "find now"
5. The Virus has a teddy bear icon with the name jdbgmgr.exe
DO NOT OPEN IT
6. Go to Edit (on the menu bar), choose "select all" to highlight the
file without opening it.
7. Now go to File (on the menu bar) and select delete. It will then go
to the Recycle Bin.
8. Go to the Recycle Bin and delete it there as well
IF YOU FIND THE VIRUS, YOU MUST CONTACT ALL THE PEOPLE IN YOUR ADDRESS
BOOK,
SO THEY CAN ERADICATE IT IN THEIR OWN ADDRESS BOOKS.
SORRY ABOUT THIS
To do this:-
a) Open a new e-mail message
b) Click the icon of the address book next to the "TO"
c) Highlight every name and Add to "BCC"
d) Copy this message....enter subject.....paste to e-mail.....send.

Thanks and sorry for the inconvenience.

>ok folks so....im proud to announce that the worlds smallest most un
>lucrative record label is one year old..
the sebadre cords was a concept that lived in the tidy confides of my skull
for a while until the secret cervix needed a release to take with them to
cornerbrook for a rock and roll tour to arts town..

with help from the band we put out the pansy core compilation (cassette)
it featured tracks by the secret cervix,fell down some stairs,the
co-stars,the shivering men, the origin of the sound,thee co-starzee,and
shamblinal....(90 min)

next up i took my origin of the sound demos i was compiling and culled them
to come up with the origin of the sound volume 1
its crusty acoustic pop..synth pop..sample pop..angry crust rock..
recorded between 2000 and 2001(maybe even 1999) (casette)
these casettes each came with original cover art(60 min)

thirdly ..was my venture into the world of cds..
i released the ep "the united states of ontario"
title track is not on the record (in case anyone goes to open mics and knows
the song)it is 5 songs and a bells chime two spacy acoustic pop songs one
dysfunctional noise track ,a jangly spoken word/pop song\
and a track of guitar vomit featuring a sample from the village of the
damned about nuclear energy..(cd)(19:15)

my fourth release was a double disc..that was double dipped (if anyone gets
my drift)
it ranges from the spooky to the obvious to the confused to th efloaty
over all its rather uncomfortable i think but fun to listen to(hopefullY)
its called the origin of the sound volume ?
nation crustacean and the ok kos(chaos)(90 min)

so what im gettin to.. is that release 5 is ready to go..well its in the
process of bein dumped to cd....
its 8 tracks less "dipped" than the double recording..
but thing is..the sebadre cords doesnt hate making money it just doesnt..
so im re releasing some of the stuff..(all of it if desired) i'm starting
with the first cd "the united states of ontarion e.p.
i have 13 burnt and ready to go..im just in th eprocess of making the custom
covers that will acccompany the ep..

they are $5 please buy them to help fund the new disc and the sebadre cords
in general
lots of work goes into it..
5 releases in one year for year one..thats ok.!

pansy core comp ($5)
origin vol.1 ($5)
united states of ontario($5)
origin vol.? ($10)
she's out of gas, and i have nothing left to sell..(not ready yet)

do check symantek re:  these virus hoaxes --

This is a hoax that, like the SULFNBK.EXE Warning hoax, tries to
persuade you to delete a legitimate Windows file from your computer. The
file that the hoax refers to, Jdbgmgr.exe, is a Java Debugger Manager.
It is a Microsoft file that is installed when you install Windows.

NOTE: Recent version of this hoax take advantage of the recent outbreak
of the W32.bugbear@mm worm, and the fact that the Jdbgmgr.exe file that
is mentioned in the hoax has a bear icon. The actual W32.bugbear@mm worm
file is an .exe file and does not have a bear icon.

The Windows Jdbgmgr.exe file has a teddy bear icon as described in the
hoax:



CAUTION: Jdbgmgr.exe, like any file, can become infected by a virus. One
virus in particular, W32.Efortune.31384@mm, targets this file. Norton
AntiVirus has provided protection against W32.Efortune.31384@mm since
May 11, 2001.

NOTE: If you have already deleted the Jdbgmgr.exe file, some Java
applets may not run correctly. This is not a critical system file. The
file version may vary with your operating system and version of Internet
Explorer. If you want to restore the file, read the instructions in the
How to restore the Jdbgmgr.exefile section at the end of this document.

Wait, wait, wait. We didnt know that was a language poetry claim. In
all good faith, we bought it off Anselm, who said that it was a
sure-fire New York School vein. Bromige talked me into buying it and
said that he would soon pay me back for his half.

This is apparently a hoax.  All Windows computers have the jdbgmgr.exe
program, so it's not a virus. (I'm told it's the "Microsoft Debugger
Registrar for Java," whatever that means.)  Someone evidently had the
brilliant idea of creating a kind of virtual virus that takes the form of a
message telling people that they already have a virus, which they are then
instructed to pass along to everyone else in their address books, leading
everyone to delete a perfectly innocuous file.  It's a kind of cybernetic
hypochondria.

VENICE, Calif. -- After the events of September 11th, we could not encounter
a novel more timely. Not far in the future, a series of strange and
catastrophic weather events have crippled the technological infrastructure of
the world, but particularly in America where it seems that Capitalism and the
American way of life are on the verge of annihilation. From the darkness a
rumor emerges that a dragon is responsible for the fall of the modern world.
One man knows the secret and only one young woman can save the planet. From
Chuck Rosenthal comes one possible apocalyptic vision of the future.

Rosenthal's gothic vision of the future is terrifying and beautiful. In the
gorgeous lyric prose for which he's known, like the creator of a modern-day
Frankenstein monster, Chuck Rosenthal takes us on a journey towards
humanity's ultimate destruction and redemption.

Like all of us, Rosenthal is concerned about the future of the planet. His
dragon, a speaking advocate for animal rights and environmentalism, is also a
metaphor for righteousness and the war on terrorism. Rosenthal's approach to
terrorism is complex and philosophical. Change and compromise are necessary
for humankind's survival.

Join this author for a publication reading at Dutton's Bookstore in
Brentwood.

I've been given a cease and desist from the New York Times regarding the use
of their images and homepage design and the use of their advertiser's images
in my Raoul Vaneigem Meets the Talking Spiderheads from Mars series.

I knew this would happen eventually, and don't see any real need to argue
with them as I didn't intend these detournements to be anything more than
graffiti on a wall, subject to the elements.  I'm taking them down in 5
days -- they requested they come down in 10 days, but I'm being a nice guy.

However, I'd like to give folks the chance to download the page for their
own private viewing (not to be put on their website).  Your very own piece
of illegal net art!  (No one will ever know you have it, shhh.)

The cease and desist letter states: "Most significantly, you have
substantially changed the lead article to include long and rambling made-up
quotes from British Prime Mininster Tony Blair regarding the need to act
against Iraq, under the byline of Raoul Vaneigem."

Of course, I didn't actually write any of the text that appears in these
pieces.  Anything that was not part of the original NY Times article was
taken from the writings of Raoul Vaneigem, the French Situationist --
considered a great prose stylist -- either from The Revolution of Everyday
Life or from Contributions to The Revolutionary Struggle, Intended To Be
Discussed, Corrected, And Principally, Put Into Practice Without Delay.
Both of these texts can be found at www.nothingness.org.

Here are the links to the three pages:

Blair Presents Dossier on Iraq's Biological Weapons
http://www.arras.net/blair_presents_dossier.htm

Daschle Denounces Bush Remarks on Iraq as Partisan
http://www.arras.net/daschle_denounces_bush.htm

Clinton Says He Backs Tough U.N. Resolution on Iraq Inspections
http://www.arras.net/clinton_backs_resolution.html

Get your kicks quick!

cheers
Brian

PS I wrote these lovely words to a friend this afternoon about the pages --
obviously I was on my soap box:

The point, as I see it, was to turn the mundane materials of the New York
Times into poetry by juxtaposing the page -- ads, logos, links, etc. -- with
revolutionary rantings by a type of person we probably won't see for some
time, i.e. Vaneigem.

If Vaneigem's writings are able to make this transformation -- a Catholic
sensibility like his might even suggest something like transubstantiation,
which of course doesn't sound so radical when it's digital materials we are
talking about -- then it opens up a window of possiblity for
social/aesthetic activity.

The logical next step would be to take a city, fill it with Situationist
graffiti, etc. etc. or with young Situationist recruits acting on Vaneigem's
precepts -- not likely.

The target was not the New York Times -- it's easy enough to make fun of a
newspaper -- but to take the reality of the Times, all of its mundane
details, and somehow suggest that this reality is a form of social control
that can be evaded by simple but artful acts of detournement, tiny gestures
that don't even rely on wit, puns, knowledge etc., but are simple collages
that punch holes in the spectacle.

But added to that, throw a critique back at Vaneigem suggesting that
revolutionary rhetoric is always outpaced by the course of events,
especially when the course is determined by spineless world leaders with
their fingers on the red buttons.

It's interesting (perhaps)to think that Brian S has created a critically
elusive art work. Which is to say, anyone wanting to fully re-present and
write about any of these documents will need to get permission and releases
from the New York Times. I assume Brian is quoting Raoul under some free-
wheeling concept of "fair use", in which part of the assumption is that
Raoul would naturally be complicit with Brian's invigoration of de-turning
this country's "paper of record" and would not also ask Brian to "cease &
desist."
I suspect one way to get around the Times' "cease & desist" order will be
for someone else to lift Brian's work (a little more "fair use") and
represent it under the auspices of a fresh web identity. Thereby forcing the
"poor" lawyers at the NY Times to subject the new "owner" to a fresh "cease
and desist" order. And this process of "the escaping art work" could go on
for a long line of the Times' lawyers dimes and dollars while, nevertheless,
keeping the original work alive, as well as giving the opportunity for the
birth and progression of more NY Times "detournements" - albeit with a
loosely collaborating series of new authors . The life of the original work
& concept would then begin to resemble the Disney cartoon animal in the
chase scene - not Mickey, but some acrobatic Disney creature(who? this goes
back to the progressive Disney 30's)- who eludes capture through magnificent
smarts and skills, no matter the persistence of the Corporate avenger.
Needless to say, for those among us who are law obeying critics, it will
still be impossible to re-present the work in a traditional context sans
permissions and proper lawyerly genuflections. An art work without a
legitimate critical history - what a concept!

Bill. Thanks: I'm certainly,as you see not a one dimensional personage as
they say.....but (I suppose this is not so new I suppose) but my 'idea" -
slowly forming/formed - is that my
posts/poetry/talk/life/poetry/politics/inspirations/stupidities/silly
jokes/asides/misinformation/puzzlement/fear/aporiation/complexity/simplicity
/ontological
chocolateness/loves/hates/eating/drinking/irrasceration/kindness/hate/love
all are integegrated. not a new idea per se but maybe a new and unique
individual as we all are...ALL I say ....but Murat finds some of my posts
like a trip: well in a sense they are, they flow...I'm an inveterate
rambler....hence I could never write very good essays...or I could if I
"warmed"  to the subject, but everything seems to me to be interconnected
somewhow.....never knew where or when to start or finish (which is
worse(?))...I dont know how...I can see the divisions but one thinks of the
title of Monsieur Piombino's book  "The Boundaries of Blur"...and to digress
and thus neccesarily demonstrate my methodology , I have dipped into
it...but I havent read it all, to my shame, but I like "blur" (and concision
when required)....and ellipsis: i am a great ellipsicator... in my thought
cocktails... Richard. PS   Please note "irrasceration" it can be used by
other poets/philosophers and all them types on application to

It was I who "turned you in," Brian.

I'll check my archives to see if I saved an electronic
copy of the original e-mail that I sent to The Times.
I forwarded copies to every address in "Contact Us" on
their web site: web-editor@nytimes.com;
executive-editor@nytimes.com;
managing-editor@nytimes.com; news-tips@nytimes.com; .
. .  Janet L. Robinson, President and General Manager,
president@nytimes.com; all the way up to Arthur Ochs
Sulzberger Jr., Chairman and Publisher,
publisher@nytimes.com (who I'm sure is a very nice
man).


Like yours, I consider my actions to be a
politico-artistic gesture, a sort of New Realism
combined with Till Eulenspiegel, only more of a
choreographic-theatrical-sculptural mixed media than
yours' nice planar two-dimensionality ("graffiti on a
wall") and symbolic action, as mine involved real
protagonists moving through time and space.


. . . After all, if those nervous nellies are actually
worrying that TIPS (Terrorism Information and
Prevention System) is going to get 1 out of 24 decent
Americans to inform on each other, we might as well
give them some materialized fantasy material to chase
their anti-anxiety medicine!

  I've been given a cease and desist from the New York
Times regarding the use
  of their images and homepage design and the use of
their advertiser's images
  in my Raoul Vaneigem Meets the Talking Spiderheads
from Mars series.

  I knew this would happen eventually, and don't see
any real need to argue
  with them as I didn't intend these detournements to
be anything more than
  graffiti on a wall, subject to the elements.  I'm
taking them down in 5
  days -- they requested they come down in 10 days,
but I'm being a nice guy.

  However, I'd like to give folks the chance to
download the page for their
  own private viewing (not to be put on their
website).  Your very own piece
  of illegal net art!  (No one will ever know you have
it, shhh.)

  The cease and desist letter states: "Most
significantly, you have
  substantially changed the lead article to include
long and rambling made-up
  quotes from British Prime Mininster Tony Blair
regarding the need to act
  against Iraq, under the byline of Raoul Vaneigem."

  Of course, I didn't actually write any of the text
that appears in these
  pieces.  Anything that was not part of the original
NY Times article was
  taken from the writings of Raoul Vaneigem, the
French Situationist --
  considered a great prose stylist -- either from The
Revolution of Everyday
  Life or from Contributions to The Revolutionary
Struggle, Intended To Be
  Discussed, Corrected, And Principally, Put Into
Practice Without Delay.
  Both of these texts can be found at
www.nothingness.org.

  Here are the links to the three pages:

  Blair Presents Dossier on Iraq's Biological Weapons
  http://www.arras.net/blair_presents_dossier.htm

  Daschle Denounces Bush Remarks on Iraq as Partisan

  Clinton Says He Backs Tough U.N. Resolution on Iraq
Inspections
  http://www.arras.net/clinton_backs_resolution.html

  Get your kicks quick!

  cheers
  Brian

  PS I wrote these lovely words to a friend this
afternoon about the pages --
  obviously I was on my soap box:

  The point, as I see it, was to turn the mundane
materials of the New York
  Times into poetry by juxtaposing the page -- ads,
logos, links, etc. -- with
  revolutionary rantings by a type of person we
probably won't see for some
  time, i.e. Vaneigem.

  If Vaneigem's writings are able to make this
transformation -- a Catholic
  sensibility like his might even suggest something
like transubstantiation,
  which of course doesn't sound so radical when it's
digital materials we are
  talking about -- then it opens up a window of
possiblity for
  social/aesthetic activity.

  The logical next step would be to take a city, fill
it with Situationist
  graffiti, etc. etc. or with young Situationist
recruits acting on Vaneigem's
  precepts -- not likely.

  The target was not the New York Times -- it's easy
enough to make fun of a
  newspaper -- but to take the reality of the Times,
all of its mundane
  details, and somehow suggest that this reality is a
form of social control
  that can be evaded by simple but artful acts of
detournement, tiny gestures
  that don't even rely on wit, puns, knowledge etc.,
but are simple collages
  that punch holes in the spectacle.

  But added to that, throw a critique back at Vaneigem
suggesting that
  revolutionary rhetoric is always outpaced by the
course of events,
  especially when the course is determined by
spineless world leaders with
  their fingers on the red buttons.

One of the wonderful (and admittedly, I often think, irritating or
exasperating!) things about poetry, and what i'll presume to call our scene,
is that it's so small, and there's really no fame. It's like the sport of
running: only a tiny percentage of the population is interested or watching,
and hardly anyone gets paid, so we all get to be in the same events
--beginners and elites alike. We get to see, know, and/or talk to the really
brilliant ones, or even to be one of the really brilliant ones, to do
instead of spectate, and to interact. Last Friday at Small Press Traffic, I
went to a reading that made me appreciate this analogy: I heard Tyrone
Williams read from his first book, cc. To read Williams' book, soon after it
was published here in San Francisco, where I now live; to think and talk
about it; and then a few months later for him to come here and for me to go
and hear him, with the people who chose that book and published it
(Krupskaya) sitting amongst us in a little auditorium (there sat Kevin in
the front row, and Jocelyn a couple of rows back, and Dan behind me), while
a glitzy visual art and design reception went on rowdily and far away in the
front of the building; for a few dozen of us to sit and listen to Williams'
single voice move through that sonnet sequence "I Am Not Proud To Be Black"
in the section of the book called "Who Is It", was an experience I was lucky
to have. It was complete.

I know it'5 pre5umptuou5 to 5ay "u5" (and fittingly, the "5" key on my
computer keyboard ju5t died, and i'm u5ing the number 5 a5 a 5ub5titute).
But for me, it made an u5. I hope it did for him. I know, from hear5ay and
then from meeting him later at a party, that he live5 and teache5 in
Cincinnati, at a 5mall college there, where he i5, practically, hi5
5tudent5' only link to the kind5 of writing i now take for granted. i don't
think he ha5 much in-per5on company, poetically 5peaking, there. 5o I don't
know what it felt like, for him, to be phy5ically here, but for me, it made
an u5 that i'm coming to learn doe5n't alleviate our occa5ional or even
con5tant alienation from one another (a5 Taylor Brady pointed out to me,
when you're cc'd, you're not directly addre55ed--the per5on writing i5 not
writing to you), but it doe5 5peak to and touch  our i5olation. And in doing
5o, 5omehow, it create5  interper5onal, and even 5ocial, contact. For which
I'm deeply appreciative.

brian, i thought collaged material was in the public domain --that
is, if you collage it, you can use it w/o proper attribution, paying
permissions, etc.  it goes w/o saying that one of the points of
collage is often to substantially alter the intended message of the
original material before it has been collaged.  could you
(hypothetically, i realize, as you're committed to being nice) argue
that you are engaging in verbal collage?

hi noah
there's a show on u penn's wxpn - "live at the writers house," which tom
devaney coordinates. unsure if it's webcast. i imagine so since wxpn.com has

Noah - I'm slated to be on a Poetry show on Wesleyan
radio in a couple of weeks. It's run by a mathematics
grad student with an abiding interest in poetics and
I'm sure he'd be happy to divulge the pleasures and
perils of his enterprise. His name is Hendree, email
address:  brintonh@hotmail.com

Best,

Ravi

addendum preface:  Sunday's NYTimes had a review of an artist who does "word
art"  - if you billed what you did as "art", Brian would it be 'fair use'
for the Times to review it?

Stephen,
     i've already asked Brian for permission to post his email as written to
my 'invstigative work" http://www.metaphormetonym.com/invest.htm as
documentaion of something that is gone from the internet.  if he agrees
Icould add your post or a reference to a print or zeroxed version which
would initiate an infinite chain of evidence to absence?

Hi Lewis, Stephen, Tom, etc. -- thanks for the comments.

Re: collage, I'm not familiar with the laws of collage, but it seems to me
what I did with the Times is very different from collage.  It's more like
impersonating an officer -- I lifted the entire "uniform" if you will, the
recognizable skin of authority, and kind of paraded around in it without
really explaining to anyone what I was doing.  Collage as we know it is
pretty obviously collage -- there is glue involved, some sort of frame, a
little tearing, etc.  But my page, outside of the URL, was pretty much the
entire Times page with the alteration of the quotes.

This also leaves me open to slander -- or something like that -- since it's
been generally perceived that I "made up" quotes for Tony Blair, etc., even
though I didn't "write" a single word of the article.  Tom Daschle, for
instance, even though I think his words are quite amazing in my version of
the story, would probably not be too happy with them, even though they would
make him the Jim Morrison of South Dakota -- and from there, the presidency!

I'd be suprised to discover that the mere act of collage puts something in
the public domain -- does that mean that were I to add "found" pictures, or
add sentences from Moby Dick, to a new Stephen King novel, then the King
novel becomes part of the public domain?  That would be remarkable and of
course I'd prefer it that way, but I don't think the argument holds water.

The URL that Lewis forwarded re: the Getty argument is very interesting, but
as you can see, unless one is going to devote a portion of one's life to
building a case against a large corporation, what you get is a lot of
e-mails flying back and forth, though I haven't yet heard again from the
Times -- I'm not even sure this person exists (it could just be Jeffrey
Jullich).  I have found other cease and desist letters by Nancy Richman
online, though.

Here's Lewis's link again: http://www.playdamage.org/getty/15.html
Re: Raoul being complicit with my actions -- if any of you out there know
Raoul Vaneigem's email address, please pass it on!  I like Stephen's musings
re: the cartoon animal in the chase scene, and proliferating detournements
-- it's funny that you read the theory of detournement coming back in
everyone from Hakim Bey and the Critical Arts Ensemble (you can find out
about them at the Autonomedia website), but it's not been picked up all that
much by web artists, and certainly not by poets.

Here's the letter, by the way.  I've deleted the phone number because I
don't want anyone playing games here!

I am counsel to The New York Times Company, the owner of The New York Times
on the Web at http://www.nytimes.com.

It has come to our attention that you have posted an altered version of the
home page of the September 24, 2002 edition of nytimes.com at
http://www/arras.net/blair_present-dossier.htm.  While the page reproduces
the nytimes.com template, including the day's advertisements, it replaces
selected bylines and other features with content you have supplied.  Most
significantly, you have substantially changed the lead article to include
long and rambling made-up quotes from British Prime Mininster Tony Blair
regarding the need to act against Iraq, under the byline of Raoul Vaneigem.

The editors at the Times appreciate a good parody and would not take action
against it.  However, the subject matter of this particular page appears to
be more serious in nature.  Therefore, even though we are sure that your
intent was non-malicious, we must inform you that your use of the Times's
name, logos and home page design and layout constitutes trademark and
copyright infringement.

While we respect your efforts to make a statement, we must ask that you do
so in a manner that does not violate our proprietary rights, or the rights
of our advertisers.  Please remove the page from public display and confirm
to us in writing within the next ten days that you will not use our home
page in the future in this same way.  If you would like to discuss this
matter, please give me a call at 212- xxx xxxx.   Thank you for your
cooperation.

3 poems by Ronald Palmer

Teaser # 1:

Ver: Bal Bel: Lig: Ere: Nce

Some lives begin as a race to the most prestigious kindergarten.
Sensationalogics!
I found it disturbing and therefore erotic. Hystericalogics.
Occasionalogics.

***
Teaser #2:

Verb Confusion: (No Suggestions)

When the penitentiary is appealing: I've got your stitches. (Growling like a
tiger in rain).
I follow him on the snow path from the parking lot to the edge of the trees.
Scoring the penis
as prize.  It is after midnight under the moon. We are surrounded by trees
and patches of snow.

***
Teaser #3:

The Logic of Thunder

    O mother of pause: I am filling with thunder. Bring with you only
your mild smack of thunder
and a cataract of rain. Everything's Crane. (Para mi: si como no: mas tro:
nada!) Thunder became
feminized by his own obedient dedication to perky pectorals: shaving:
oiling: powdering: strutting
his nipples down Commercial Street like a lady cat: lady cat: lady cat.

*************
3 poems by CAConrad

Brought tape recording of ocean tide to Atlantic City.  Laid on beach, tape
recorder at right ear, ocean at left.  Eyes closed, I was between oceans,
crash over here, crash over there.  A brain takes the world at its word when
spoken in water.  Twice the tides matched, twice they entered
me...together...synchro...
"How A Plunge Went Thru Me" is the title of this at the end.

****

FAST FOOD EPIPHANY

my American Beef Consumption Average
met me at midnight
eating burgers in an empty parking lot
Heifer Spirits mooing in the back seat
I drive to McDonald's
do the Living Spirit Dance
around the deep fat fryer
around the spatula
prostrate before the grill
I chant apology
invoke the spirit COME!
someone calls the police
I dance again
someone screams
the Great Spirit Bull leaping over registers
charging tables with his horns
the Spirit Horse gallops from the freezer
(see who else we've eaten)
I ride the stallion thru the parking lot
my Great White Bellies
crush Lakota toddlers
I drive thru a store front
years of constipation
mess the silk of mannequins
fresh steaming excrement
a Sacred Cow porridge
I cake myself and howl
ancestors steering me
whirl me down the boulevard
sides of beef
circle overhead
quivering
into rigor mortis
the Spirit Herd
moos in harmony
follows me back
to pastures
the lot of us
dissolve into the
spinning top
of Saturn

****

SEVERED LEG PIROUETTE

"vacant land"
means no
people

"nothing but a few
prairie dogs"
means no
people

"we swerved, hit
a cat, but no one
was hurt"
means no
people

mind-goggling permutations here when you consider it.

- I think it's related to Clemente's spam/anti-spam work.

- a former unnamed list member has built a whole industry for himself out of
attack and fakery.

- the issues of 'framing' and 'labeling' do seem to have endless
permutations.  - at what point does a celeb (use Elvis here in the post but
fill in your own blanks in your mind) slip over the line into self-parody if
such a chimera is a possibility?  or consider when collage becomes Collage
or wordart? - probably when it's sold for big bucks in NY?

-on the other hand, as the NYTimes letter to points out, sometimes this
stuff does have serious consequences.   or does really matter, like in
Clemente's work and the potential for a collage of viral terrorist spams
sends shivvers through my gut.

perhaps laughter and poetry can matter?

Tom: I like your Metaphor etc. investigative site - a least the very
interesting piece on Argentina - and will look at more later.
As to putting my "unplugged" response into the context of the site, just
lift and use. I assume lawyers will not be emailing me to desist from my
theoretical meandering.   Underneath all of this I think there remain
proprietary issues - in that, ironically, as we have seen too often, the
momentary poetic or artistic gesture anarchistally presented - and often to
great delight - becomes a corporate counter-gesture (i.e. a much more
permanent  appropriation) in which the original gesture/concept is
simulated. The unwanted ads, for example, that pop up on the monitor over
the 'real' content (as we try to read within what we thought was the
sanctified space/part of the web page), may be also be interpreted as
corporate "deturnings."
    In other words, word and visual gestures that momentarily liberate
public space come back as corporate logos/brands simulating art.
Counter-reaping what is sewn.
    So sometimes it's much stronger position to create one's own "original
and protected work," as well as to respect that of others. Though obviously
that act makes it a much longer haul to crack the public surface. The
experienced frustration compelling alternate routes.
    I suspect we will live with both options for a long time.

Brian,

Congrats on a job well done :-) I suggest you take your letter and frame it!
This is, in my opinion, analogus to the obsenity trials of the last
century(ies) for poets. I am so proud of you.

Durn. I kinda liked old Raoul.

Mostly on that first day, when it took a bit to figure out what was
going on . . . for 20 seconds I thought George Bush was getting
interesting . . .

I guess that'll not be happening again. Snif.

Snif-snif even,

------------------

I've been given a cease and desist from the New York Times regarding
the use of their images and homepage design and the use of their
advertiser's images in my Raoul Vaneigem Meets the Talking
Spiderheads
from Mars series.

I knew this would happen eventually, and don't see any real need to
argue with them as I didn't intend these detournements to be anything
more than graffiti on a wall, subject to the elements.  I'm taking
them down in 5 days -- they requested they come down in 10 days, but
I'm being a nice guy.

However, I'd like to give folks the chance to download the page for
their own private viewing (not to be put on their website).  Your very
own piece of illegal net art!  (No one will ever know you have it,
shhh.)

The cease and desist letter states: "Most significantly, you have
substantially changed the lead article to include long and rambling
made-up quotes from British Prime Mininster Tony Blair regarding the
need to act against Iraq, under the byline of Raoul Vaneigem."

Of course, I didn't actually write any of the text that appears in
these pieces.  Anything that was not part of the original NY Times
article was taken from the writings of Raoul Vaneigem, the French
Situationist -- considered a great prose stylist -- either from The
Revolution of Everyday Life or from Contributions to The Revolutionary
Struggle, Intended To Be Discussed, Corrected, And Principally, Put
Into Practice Without Delay. Both of these texts can be found at
www.nothingness.org.

Here are the links to the three pages:

Blair Presents Dossier on Iraq's Biological Weapons

Get your kicks quick!

cheers
Brian

PS I wrote these lovely words to a friend this afternoon about the
pages -- obviously I was on my soap box:

The point, as I see it, was to turn the mundane materials of the New
York Times into poetry by juxtaposing the page -- ads, logos, links,
etc. -- with revolutionary rantings by a type of person we probably
won't see for some time, i.e. Vaneigem.

If Vaneigem's writings are able to make this transformation -- a
Catholic sensibility like his might even suggest something like
transubstantiation, which of course doesn't sound so radical when it's
digital materials we are talking about -- then it opens up a window of
possiblity for social/aesthetic activity.

The logical next step would be to take a city, fill it with
Situationist graffiti, etc. etc. or with young Situationist recruits
acting on Vaneigem's precepts -- not likely.

The target was not the New York Times -- it's easy enough to make fun
of a newspaper -- but to take the reality of the Times, all of its
mundane details, and somehow suggest that this reality is a form of
social control that can be evaded by simple but artful acts of
detournement, tiny gestures that don't even rely on wit, puns,
knowledge etc., but are simple collages that punch holes in the
spectacle.

But added to that, throw a critique back at Vaneigem suggesting that
revolutionary rhetoric is always outpaced by the course of events,
especially when the course is determined by spineless world leaders
with their fingers on the red buttons.

Boy, I hope there is karma. I wonder whether that is what widows in
Iraq are saying.

I mean we know that Iraq doesnt have atomic weapons. If they did,
Bush and the Texans would not think of bombing it.

A Library of Congress Rare Book Forum


A Lecture by Steve Clay
"The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bouwerie: Being an
Account of the Poets, Poetry, Poetics, Publications, Readings and
Recordings (emanating from a diverse array of characters on the Lower
East Side of Manhattan, 1966-present)"=20

Thursday, November 14, 2002.   6:30 p.m
Coolidge Auditorium,=20
Library of Congress Jefferson Building,=20
101 Independence Ave., S.E., Washington, DC  20540=20


The title of Clay's talk only hints at the rich, variegated topic Clay,
an editor, publisher, and book artist, will be discussing.  Since 1966
the Poetry Project has been the leading American venue for innovative
poetry, a setting for and model of the germination of a new form of
American poetry that takes its cues from writers associated with Black
Mountain, the New York School, the San Francisco Renaissance, the Beats,
and other experimental traditions that took root after World War II.

Bringing together artists and poets, the Project has helped forge the
template for the artist-run, artist-managed organizations. An exemplar
for independent literary centers across the U.S., the Poetry Project has
figured in the production of literary magazines and presses such as C,
Angel Hair, Adventures in Poetry, Cuz, Milk, and Telephone, as well as
serving as a gathering place for hundreds of performers, poets, writers,
playwrights and visionaries. Creative spirits who performed, discoursed,
taught, argued, protested and seduced audiences at the Project have
included Allen Ginsberg, John Ashbery, Alice Notley, Adrienne Rich,
Alice Walker, John Cage, Sam Shepard, Amiri Baraka, Lisa Jarnot, Terri
McMillan, Jessica Hagedorn, Edwin Torres, Robert Creeley, Patti Smith,
Dael Orlandersmith, Ted Berrigan, Yoko Ono, Eileen Myles, Ron Padgett,
Juliana Spahr, Charles Bernstein, Sherman Alexie and Michael Ondaatje.

In his talk, Clay will chart the history of this colorful and seminal
organization. "I will seek to elaborate the role of community, of the
poetry reading as live event, and the production of magazines and books
[i.e. by hand at home with friends] as significant factors in the
evolution of this particularly American poetics," Clay said. "Its
reverberations and resonances are central for those at the forefront of
innovative poetry today."

Steve Clay is the editor and publisher of Granary Books. For nearly
twenty years, Granary has brought together writers, artists, and
bookmakers to explore the intersection of the verbal and the visual in
the time-honored context of independent publishing. Granary's mission --
to theorize, produce, promote, and document new works that explore the
interplay of word, image, and page - has earned it a reputation as one
of today's unique and significant small publishers.

Clay is a hands-on participant in this process. In 1998, he and Rodney
Phillips curated and co-authored the catalog for the New York Public
Library's widely acclaimed exhibition, "A Secret Location on the Lower
East Side: Adventures in Writing 1960-1980." In 2000, Clay and Jerome
Rothenberg co-edited the massive anthology, A Book of the Book: Some
Works & Projections About the Book & Writing.


The LC FORUM will begin promptly at 6:30 p.m. on November 14, 2002, in
the Coolidge Auditorium, Ground Floor Jefferson Building of The Library
of Congress,    101 Independence Ave., S.E.  The event is free and open
to the public, but we encourage those of you who expect to attend to
contact the Rare Book and Special Collections Division to make a
reservation: telephone (202) 707-2026; fax (202) 707-4142; or e-mail at

TO DRIVE THROUGH JUNE

It would be interesting
to drive through June. I
would think about it
sometimes. The help
I received was called extra,
in corridors it
sits like a diamond statute.

Is it permissible to imagine a red
corpus. The feeling
was one of
disintegration. This would
be faster than thinking.

Move to examine
the table. The table was left
out in the cold. Increased
chance of calling you
up, seventy-five percent
humility. Hugely important
I thought, a great step
forward for the sentences.

It was a jabbing
motion. Not accelerating, not damaged.
The doctor tells me you're waiting for
a signal.
Last night it was different.

Togetherness? Say so and I'll
leap quiescently into the gap. Partitioned
from the electorate the test
pattern is static.
Coffee and
empathy. Yes to questions. Sort
it out secondhand.

Dressing
for the event, I made no reply. Your shirt
was longer than
expected. Dawn was an affair
with tassels.

Sawing logs is what they
call it. To bring about a furnished
example, mix frank
assurances with zest. Try folding
twice instantly and
waive reward. You should
hear a crack.

Kind of low energy
all day long. Garbage was paving
the sidewalk, suggesting
a mass exodus. Some renegade
futurists made it
a national pastime.
Entertaining the tropes.

Salvation Army
was a way
of marking time. Each store's
unique racks of red, stacks of yellow.
Whites not
in evidence.

if we were to create a post-canon canon, we'd be just sitting in another
pile of ink, tho that transmoded idiom would fail us as well. you want
names? places where we have been? a conjecture freely taken from this thing
that fits the middle of my hand, and yet can itself become a subject: it is
a sentence. let's just examine one sentence as a fierce freehold for all
sentences, and the people who love them. the canon is why the freebooters
took the city. would people be important in this canon, so called, or just
the dire sentence so intoned? containment provides the initial alert, then
we reach the school.

Lewis,
Care to draw a line toward the *many others*? And I am curious about the
*why* of these choices...since we're canonizing...one detail about one or
more of the people you listed...specifically- what
innovation/experiment/technique/device/lexicon/etc that casts them in a
divine scope?
I would have to add Harryette Mullen for polyphonic wit, fused
orality/literacy and tacit syntactic tactics...

Jane,

Lewis was refering to Me in the form of 'many others ...'

He was being kind to not inflate my head. He knows this kind of worship is
too much for me to bare. The reason why is obvious -- no one is better than
The Canon and why should there be  .... when the canon is Me.


I hope this clears up things :-)

Best, St Geoffrey of Gatza

down to you: Virginia was made for a series of festivals
that work: the devil's color seemed alien to a different color
not released: this world hides behind two screens
some would have it: physical and spiritual
electronic reinterpretation: choreography ran thin when it moved
beautiful: the schedule was always overshadowed in thirty years
I can't describe: good-humor motorized to equalize the latest pastoral
central projection: loud & clear like an elefish jellyphant
the sun: strapwork licentiously flying through mainframe ricochet
Virginia's entablature: DON'T FALL FOR ANY OFF-BRAND VIRGINIAS
a mirror: begin with the translation & let the source find its own way
farmer's daughter: every other ingredient embarrasses the dish
shooting-manual: persuasion is the handmaid of poesy
the Sleeper: violence shimmied with the godsend's biggest body
dotted rhythm: my first exposure to dragging the river for Latin poets
ear-splitting moon: Didi and Gogo wait for the Great Pumpkin
Mistadobalina: the very thing as anxious as flesh
a whole lot: Jeff Harrison is the name left over from interruption
terribly impressed: a toothbrush soaked in whatever suits the occasion
a peroration: pictures should NEVER be associated with fragrances
identifiable: only twenty stories are covered with tradition
blood decree: a sharp quarter may own the two thirds
untouched: the month of June is desirous of the title "murderess"

Take a ticky tack tock tookay

        there is a dream of the city
        before the city, during the city,
        after the city

In the dream, the city sees a giant
peeling pears with its teeth.  "Which way
to Mobile, to Decatur?" she asks.
The giant's glowing nipples and imagist hair.

The giant is not the giant but is.  The city
carries a carpetbag he thinks is Wisconsin
and acts like a French toupee.
River racing through the air,

the city tries to say "the ground"
down, down, but can't find its head
in the clouds.  The giant calls himself
"T. Tickey" and pulls a coin from his food.

On the ledge, the city sees "T" as
almost ant-like, like a satellite would,
like an album cover of the world's smallest
band -- beneath the ledge there is another.

what's behind a question like this?
wouldn't the point of a post-canon canon be to not revolve around
pronouns like "who"?
what determines the postness of an endeavor like this; what makes it
more than a revision along slightly tweaked lines?

Such a blizzard of verbiage leaves its silt on the
coffee.
Lean over to blow it cold with a soft spot of pain
cradled in your head, and you'll see I'm right (as
always),

though slightly smaller. Should I cut my hair
short this weekend, or leave it to grow hormone thumbs
and infect the lexicon with starving? Frost spun
like silk soot from spiders' throngs pushed
prisms to my eyes, and you too grope radiant

spools in the dark of carpal lackluster awe, tummy
buttered with gerund deflection, like spitting
pits of periods into your words to call it code.
This will make you famous among everyone who could
possibly know you, at least those with no linguistics;

in case of fire, break axe over neck. I'm going bald
anyway; soon, having lost to snowballs and ascii,
I'll ask you to place your ever-widening thumb

over that shrink of breathing my head makes
next to yours; I'll ask you to push, push hard, until
the coffee comes out. We'll find a word for it yet.

The widows of Iraq are that rare breed who (a) know what to shop for at a
fetish market (there are plenty of these in Baghdad) to ward off appearances
of djinn & daemons, and (b) are dead shots with their imported Kalishnakovs.
  If these don't constitute Karma, then Amerika ain't been discovered yet.

Hello All,

My new book, THE YELLOW HOTEL, is just out from Verse Press and I am looking
for reading venues.  I would be interested to know of any good ones in New
England, NY, NJ, Philadelphia, or Baltimore (where I would be willing to go
for free) and any others elsewhere that might provide travel expenses.  Kindly

so it seems one can be happy in or out of list. just to be frank, we met on
the border of the country next door, expecting a tad of refreshment before
nuclear time. it is officially later when the clock shows its candid nature.
the train stops on schedule but we find that the wind has lost trusty
sentences forever. we who look over our shoulders are always surprised by
the train speeding toward us. we say, this is quite a situation. will the
train finish what it has to say as we watch the caboose recede? will that be
'it'? maybe so, research is ongoing. gladly, tho, the farfetched sentence
will smirk on another horizon while the rascals and their paychecks become
enamoured by something even further into the dark. what a wasteland to talk
about, with bright ideas masquerading as train tracks. let's mark our glory
now, with long lists, and resume our sentimental praxis. by god, the changes
at the brink will do us good.

The presumption is that there are particular individuals, "who's" that
inform our writing and reading. Or if not whose, then what? To unoblique the
obvious:  *Canon* itself is problematic- some compass whose magnet is
definitely fixed on untrue north.
The question is, if you were to articulate the who or the what or the how of
what comprises a personally *true north* interpretation of poetry *now* what
would go into this mix? Its interesting that people are unsettled by this
word, canon. It is, after all, a weapon.

And whereas handguns are constructed with basically one purpose, the canon
is multiplicitous. So explode the sky a little. Make a firework. And let it
be names or concepts or visual art or whatever gets you off. Or sentences,
but...what gets your fingers twitching, and your thoughts? Is it too
problematic to ask for specificity? Maybe our post-canon canon is just
ether.

I agree with Maria. The only use of a new canon that I can imagine is for
the simulation of an now ancient war tool the only current application of
which would be to try to heroically posture and invite an early post-mortem.
I think we have enough of those people at the leadership of our current
government.
Canon, adios!

Woops, I did confuse the "cannon" with "Canon" - artillery as different from
Church Law. I beg your sympathy for an old learning disability. (What's
occasional good for making a poem is not good for straight composition!).
 My apologies to the Church. And is that what this is about?

If I may be permitted just a _hint_ of exasperation:

we academics (amongst whom you might count yourself, Jane, for all I know,
though hereabouts we usually 'know em by their .edu suffix)--we academics have
been batting this particular one around for one hell of a long time.  Nothing
in your two messages suggests that you've assimilated the debate.  By all means
name some artists whose work you think important:  that's not creating a canon,
that's making a list of artists whose work you think important.  Canons get
created via lengthy, institutional processes.  See Guillory, _Cultural
Capital_, Golding _From Outlaw to Classic_, etc, etc, etc........

How about a Poetry Top 20?  (Again with the music analogies...) Top 20 in
the last 20...10...5  Or, a game we have played before:  what's on my
bookshelf.

I am not being entirely facetious (although I could go there) with this.
I think what Jane is getting out is the desire to give props to folks or
honor our elders--especially when we see them as obscured by the fuss and
must of the fucking mainstream.  However, I kinda agree with Maria, but in
a different register.  Canons take institutions.  A canon is not just the
text, but the ancillary commentary which shapes and informs the reception
of the canonized text.  If you want power, canonize away...though like
Leninism, decanonization is somewhat optimistic about what results when
you seize the means of power (rather than the means of reproduction).

i just read Fanny Howe's "selected poems" and was very impressed by
her verse skills

is she canonical?

in any case, one vote for F.H., thanks.

then Stephen Vincent erred homonymously:

>"Woops, I did confuse the 'cannon' with 'Canon' - artillery as different"

De artillitate:
The following is from Heron's _Belopoeica_.

"The largest and most essential part of philosophical study deals with
tranquility, about which a great many researches have been made and still
are being made by those who concern themselves with learning; and I think
the search for tranquility will never reach a definite conclusion through
the argumentative method.  But Mechanics, by means of one of its smallest
branches -- I mean, of course, the one dealing with what is called
artillery-construction -- has surpassed argumentative training in this
score and taught mankind to live a tranquil life."

  This translation of _Belopoeica_ is taken from Mardsden's _Greek and
Roman Artillery: Technical Treatises_ (Oxford: Clarendon, 1971).

First that pretzel incident of Dubya's, and now this.  It almost makes you

POETRY IS NEWS

As citizens we demonstrate, write letters, and make known our discontent
and outrage at government policies. As writers we constantly interact
with different audiences in various contexts. We perform, read, teach,
get interviewed, and curate public programs. But as more and more people
are ready to commit acts of civil disobedience, we cannot continue
appearing in public and pretend nothing is happening.

POETRY IS NEWS, a forming coalition of poets, proposes to disrupt
business as usual, at least within the spheres we have some control
over. Some of us have been long active in various forms of political
work, some of us are inexperienced but eager to find ways to make our
voices heard. The mass public word has been corrupted past constructive
use for political change. As word workers, we are calling an initial
public meeting to find ways to exert our influence and expand our roles
in taking back the word and making it part of public change.

Whether we think of our mandate as a poll tax on poets or a bulletin
board for agitation, our public activities as poets must first break
down the boundaries we set for ourselves. Our goal is to create a body,
a presence, and a point of reference that, if not considered when
thinking of poetry, would simply cause embarrassment.

Is this a good idea? Are there concrete proposals that we can begin
implementing quickly, at readings, performances, in classrooms or public
spaces? Can we form working relationships with each other in order to
transmit different types of expertise, in dealing with the media, in
looking for resources, in organizing events? Let us know what you think.

SERGE FAUCHEREAU AND RON PADGETT
Serge Fauchereau is a French poet and art critic. The first to translate
Frank O'Hara into French, he taught at Stony Brook where he became
friends with Louis Zukofsky and Louis Simpson. His Lecture
de la Poesie Americaine is a wonderful account of his experiences both
personal and literary, and covers a wide range of contemporary poets. A
prolific author, he has written numerous monographs on 20th-century art and
artists such as Fernand L=E9ger and Georges Braque. More than thirty of his
titles (fiction and essays) have been translated into various languages. Hi=
s
book Complete Fiction, a collection of short prose pieces translated by Ron
Padgett and John Ashbery, has just been published by Black Square Editions.
Since 1994, he has been the artistic consultant of the European Parliament,
Espace Leopold, in Brussels. He is currently a curator for the Museo
Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid.

Addressing Ron Padgett's latest collection, You Never Know (Coffee House
Press, 2001), John Ashbery writes: "These 'late' poems of Ron Padgett have
the clearness, the small sadness, and the big space of Guillaume
Apollinaire, one of the many French writers he has translated into English.
They are like a glass of transparent Vittel water held against the sky of
Paris." Earlier titles include: Bean Spasms (Kulchur, 1967) with Ted
Berrigan, Great Balls of Fire (Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1969; revised ed.,
Coffee House Press, 1990), The Adventures of Mr. & Mrs. Jim & Ron
(Grossman/Viking, 1970) with Jim Dine, Tulsa Kid (Z Press, 1979), New &
Selected Poems (David R. Godine, 1995), Albanian Diary (The Figures, 1999),
and Poems I Guess I Wrote (Cuz Editions, 2001). A prolific translator, he i=
s
also the author of several books on education and writing.

OK, this is a wonderfully odd message/website. Thought I'd forward
it.

I love the bit about OBJECTIVISM. Ah, must we use the same term
for different things? Personally, I'm going to read _Of Being
Numerous_ tonight instead. Call it penance, I guess . . .

You've got eleven poets here; enough for either a soccer or US football
team.  Anyone care to name positions for either and/or both?  Names are
useless w/out position, and of course positions are equally, w/out
occupation.
nesting nicely meanwhile,

A glance at the heading information above the poem below shows that I
originally sent it to the poetics list the night it was composed --
Wednesday, October 23 -- it now makes its appearance eight days later, on
October 31. When I re-joined the list some months ago, I was pleasantly
surprised to note that its moderation had relaxed somewhat, but this, I
believe, sets some sort of record for review.

Of course, the nature of said poem (and others I received back channel
helping to chronicle this year's World Series) makes it somewhat like a dead
fish, or salmon, at this late date -- severely time-bound. But relegating
all such attempts as "mere" journalism would be a mistake, I think. A blurb
on the latest Philip Roth novella calls him "a master chronicler of the
American 20th century." The book in question, *The Dying Animal* is a pretty
good read, and I recommend it. But when was the last time that *poets* were
seen as chroniclers? When did we give up that part of the job description?

Which is to say that I think Andrew Rathman's and Sylvester Pollet's remarks
on different global constructs/attentions to poetry were very much to the
point. I'll have a bit more to say about that in the next few days (or
weeks, depending).

Subject:      after the net orgy
MIME-Version: 1.0

With the current corporate take-over of the Net, one can expect that the publishing activities will change. Not in a way that magazines and books will disappear. The Net itself will be a publication tool, to announce new products, fashions, ideas, in short, a new medium to manipulate people. The interactive, democratic part will very soon become a mere marginal aspect of the whole business. It will lose its innovative and subversive part and will become deadly boring. But revolutionaries are nowadays not so easy to 'absorb'. Everyone knows the laws of the media, the fashion and the sell-out of subversive ideas by 'nomadic capitalism'. The question is: do you have enough power to go for the second round, to start all over again, each time, after the net orgy will be over, to start again with very small, unimportant alternative media outside the Grid of the Net.

GAME SIX

    for Joe Safdie



A five run lead
In the seventh
Seemed plenty
For the second stingiest pen
In the bigs,
But no.

Spiezio pulled off
The best AB
Of the postseason
Climaxing
In a three-run shot
To right.

Glaus fouled one back
Sniffed his bat
Right on the sweet spot
Then cranked a double
Off the left field wall--
Whump.

Buck could only
Keep talking
And McCarver could only
Keep repeating
Every observation
In different words.

"Great pitching
Always beats
Great hitting"
The inimitable Yogi
Berra once said
"And vice versa."

In the end the Angels--
Fewest K's in '02,
Highest team batting
By ten points--
Proved him right
And then some.

from the English reviews of _Poems in English (by Samuel Beckett, which is
the only way I was able to find a copy of "Whoroscope" through interlibrary
loan, quotes from back cover, NY, Grove, 1961): "the obscurity results from
the multiple allusions and ellipses.  He is a poet." - _The Manchester
Guardian ...it is impossible to 'like' these poems.  Butif you can digest
them they will act on the nervous system like lysergic acid, and you will
never be quite the same.' - _Oxford Mail.
