antipassion


christ appears from somewhere.
he plays around with his disciples for three days.
nights he spends fucking with mary magdalene.
he develops a terrible disease.
disillusioned he climbs up a cross and stares at the sky.
his body is covered with leper's and syphilitic sores.
he worries about mary magdalene.
he's taken down from the cross.
wands are waved over his body lifting the sores away.
flails speed from the body whispering in the air.
soldiers stand around christ and help him up.
his body is shining and whole again.
he leaves the garden having fun with his disciples.
he eats dinner with them and they toast each other.
judas gives 30 pieces of silver for the terrific meal.
he walks hand in hand with mary magdalene and is on his way.
later that day he figures he might say something on the hill.

Mime-Version: 1.0

Enjoy
BELLADONNA*
with

Latasha N. Nevada Diggs & Joan Retallack

Friday, September 3, 7PM at SEGAL THEATER,
The Graduate Center, CUNY,
365 5th Avenue at 34th Street
A $7-10 donation is suggested.

Join us to celebrate the first fabulous night of our 5th Anniversary season
with two dynamic, super-expansive, multi-genre artists who challenge the
dimensions of words at a NEW location: the beautiful SEGAL THEATER-CUNY GRAD
CENTER (5th Ave/34th)—only blocks from most trains.

Writer and vocalist, Latasha N. Nevada Diggs explores sound through a myriad
of macaronic verse, language and electronic vocal processing.  She has
worked and traveled with many creative beings and her literary and sound
works have been published and recorded in projects ranging from Asian
fetishes to Euro-House.  A fellow of the Cave Canem Workshop for African
American Poets, Latasha is a 2004 Caldera Artist in Residence, 2003 Zora
Neale Hurston recipient from Naropa Institute, a 2002 Harvestworks Digital
Media Arts Center artist in residence, as well as a 2003 New York Foundation
for the Arts fellow.  She is the author of two chap-books, Ichi-Ban: from
the files of negríta muñeca linda and Ni-ban: Villa Misería and the producer
and writer for the experimental audio project, Televisíon.  She is the lead
electronic vocalist for the Zappa-esque jam band, Yohimbe Brothers, fronted
by Vernon Reid and DJ Logic and The Beat Kids, fronted by Guillermo E.
Brown.  She lives in Harlem.

Joan Retallack’s most recent books are Memnoir (Post-Apollo Press) and The
Poethical Wager—a volume of  essays (University of California Press). Other
poetry by Retallack includes Mongrelisme: A Difficult Manual for Desperate
Times (Paradigm Press), How To Do Things With Words (Sun & Moon Classics),
AFTERRIMAGES (Wesleyan University Press), and Errata 5uite (Edge Books)
which won the Columbia award for poetry in 1994. She received the 1996
America Award in Belles-Lettres for MUSICAGE: John Cage in Conversation with
Joan Retallack (Wesleyan University Press) and a Lannan Foundation Literary
Grant in 1998–99. Her WESTORN CIV CONT'D: an open book was produced at
Pyramid Atlantic Studios in 1995-96—with inadvertent funding from the
National Endowment for the Arts—and is still in progress. She is currently
finishing a volume on Gertrude Stein and starting a time-bracketed project
with the working title “The Reinvention of Truth.” Retallack teaches at Bard
College.

Belladonna* is a feminist/innovative reading and publication series that
promotes the work of women writers who are adventurous, experimental,
politically involved, multi-form, multicultural, multi-gendered,
unpredictable, dangerous with language (to the death machinery). In its five
year history, Belladonna* has featured such writers as Leslie Scalapino,
Alice Notley, Erica Hunt, Fanny Howe, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Cecilia Vicuña,
Lisa Jarnot, Camille Roy, Nicole Brossard, Abigail Child, Norma Cole, Lynne
Tillman and Carla Harryman among many other experimental and hybrid women
writers. Beyond being a platform for women writers, the curators promote
work that is experimental in form, connects with other art forms, and is
socially/politically active in content. Alongside the readings, Belladonna*
supports its artists by publishing commemorative pamphlets of their work on
the night of the event. Please contact us (Rachel Levitsky and Erica
Kaufman) at belladonnaseries@yahoo.com to receive a catalog and be placed on
our list. http://www.durationpress.com/belladonna.

*deadly nightshade, a cardiac and respiratory stimulant, having purplish-red
flowers and black berries

Belladonna* readings happen monthly between September and June

Oddly enough I have been almost continously harassed by soldiers & the
police... for reading my poetry during these times I might get jumped by
either those two groups of people & if I misstep on my faith the KKK might
just lynch my Yankee ass... don't even ask. Peace,

TWO NATIVE YOUTH MOVEMENT WARRIORS ARRESTED DURING ANTI-FAIRMONT HOTEL
RALLY

ONE WARRIOR STILL BEHIND ENEMY LINES - RANSOM SET FOR $50,000

(Sunday, August 29th, 2004, Fairmont Miramar Hotel Santa Monica,
California)

Fairmont Hotel security (assaulted) a 14 year old NYM warrior during a
peaceful
info rally which (led) to the arrest of two NYM Warriors. 14 year old Alma
Barba was handing out flyers condemning Fairmont Hotel's participation
in the
forcible removal of Secwepemc from their homeland: GENOCIDE, when a
Fairmont
security shoved her to the grass then kicked her to her back and held
her there
with his foot grinding into her chest.

Fairmont Hotel called Santa Monica Police Department and two arrests
were made,
including the arrest of WAR CLUB NYM Ryakin Rip who is in the Los
Angeles area
completing a music and speaking tour. He is being accused of issuing
terrorist
threats while defending 14 year old Alma Barba from further attack.
Ryakin is
being held for $50,000 ransom.

The Santa Monica Fairmont rally was coordinated with a rally held today
against
the expansion of Sun Peaks Resort in the interior of British Columbia,
Canada.
Fairmont Hotels has invested $40 million in Sun Peaks Resort to build
the Delta
Hotel Sun Peaks, drawing mass (tourism) to sensitive mountain areas
still depended
on by Secwepemc, the Indigenous Peoples of the land.

Sad indeed to report the death, 30 August 2004 in San Francisco, of the
great editor Donald M. Allen, (The New American Poetry 1945-1960;  Four
Seasons Foundation books and chapbooks, etc etc.). His was a truly open and
generous intelligence and spirit, and his impact on USAmerican poetry since
1960 was, well, immense.

He was still working quietly on editorial and related projects at the time
of his death. He was 91.

There will doubtless be an obit in the SF Chronicle and the NYTimes.

visit than later because shalom is off to poland and prague on the 21 of september
for 2 exhibits that he will have in those cities. i will be leaving for
prague on the 26 of september to attend the opening of his exhibit and to do some
business in europe.

like to bring a friend with me who is very interested in your work and would
like to meet you.
    i am looking forward to seeing you both again soon.

deborah

Thousands of demonstrators formed a symbolic unemployment line in Manhattan
today, standing silently along the sidewalk in a column that stretched for
miles to protest what they called the high rate of joblessness during the
term of President Bush.

Holding up pink slips of paper symbolizing the notices employees sometimes
receive when their jobs have been terminated, the demonstrators held a line
from Wall Street in Manhattan's downtown and stretched north about three
miles to the midtown area where the Republican National Convention is in its
third day today at Madison Square Garden.

"The Next Pink Slip Might Be Yours!" the fliers read.

"I've been unemployed before," Gary Goff, 57, a data processor, said to The
Associated Press. "I'm concerned that unemployment is going up so
drastically under the Bush administration. I think Bush is a disaster for
working people."

The demonstration was organized by People for the American Way, a nonprofit
group based in Washington that advocates for institutions that sustain a
diverse and democratic society.

The group said in a statement today that 5,000 people participated in what
it called "The World's Longest Unemployment Line" representing "the 1.2
million jobs lost over all since March 2001 and the more than 8 million
Americans who are currently unemployed."

Yes, Peter, Don Allen was one of the great 20th Century editors - and, at
least during the period that I knew him some, absolutely modest, and often
generous in his advise to me when I was setting up Momo's Press. His
editorial range and influence, however, was quite enormous. In addition to
his commitment to New American Writing at the Evergreen Review and the
Anthology - which also included his Four Season's imprint commitment to
publishing a related range of writers (Spicer, Duncan, Lew Welch, Richard
Brautigan & many others) I am pretty sure - though not positive - that in
his Fifties' Grove Press days  he was responsible for acquiring the
paperback translations (with great, colorful covers) of Ionesco, Arrabal ,
perhaps Genet(?) and a number of other European writers  - each of whom
shaped and influenced the sensibilities of post-war American writers and
readers. (Just off the top I wonder if anyone has ever written on the
possible influence of Inonesco's "absurdist" banter(in the plays) on the
work of Frank O'Hara? I suspect O'Hara loved the plays).

In any case, Don Allen and his works deserve a huge, big tip of the hat.

On Theatre Notes this week:

Take Me Out

As cricket is to the English, so is baseball to the Americans: a pastoral
dream of green fields peopled by shining gods.  And being, like cricket, a
"metaphor for life", it's inspired some pretty silly remarks.  Among the
sillier, Richard Greenberg's grandiose declamation that "baseball achieves
the tragic vision that democracy evades" can hang with honour.  (Unlike
democracy, it seems, baseball has losers).  Or, even better: "Baseball is a
perfect metaphor for hope in a democratic society".  Is the real problem in
Baghdad that they don't play baseball?


Terrorism

Writing plays is a delicately negotiated compromise between the subtleties
of literary ambition and the pragmatic limitations of the stage.  On the
evidence of Terrorism , the Presnyakov Brothers negotiate with style. It has
a brutal elegance, the kind of brilliantly nuanced crudity which heralds
notable theatre.

Can someone who knows Ezra Pound's works well tell me where he said
something about people who want to get 'through hell in a hurry'?  If
you could tell me where it is said (I expect in the Cantos prior to
1950) and what is said, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks

I will read at the home of my most hospitable friend Chris Stroffolino
in San Francisco on September 10.  Please come.  In my two readings
since the Carrboro Poetry Festival I've conjured nothing but blank
stares.  Will it be three in a row?  Details below.

I'll also be around the entire week so b/c me if you'd like to get
together for a lunch or dinner.

peace kevin,

best i can do at the moment: dante as the source for the pound cantos below.
this is about 1945 - 48

also there is a Cantos 16 as well

i think that it is a reference continued of 'hurry up please it's time"
in eliot's "the wasteland".

which would all make sense

peace


Circle 8, The Fraudulent and Malicious (Simple Fraud)

Bolgia 1, The Panderers and Seducers who make up two files are driven at
an endless fast walk by horned demons who hurry them along with great
lashes. In life these sinners goaded others on to serve their own foul
purposes. so in Hell are they driven in their turn. The horned demons
who drive them symbolize the sinners' own vicious natures, embodiments
of their own guilty consciences.


PISAN CANTOS
LXXXI
~ Ezra Pound

What thou lovest well remains,
the rest is dross
What thou lov'st well shall not be reft from thee
What thou lov'st well is thy true heritage
Whose world, or mine or theirs
or is it of none?
First came the seen, then thus the palpable
Elysium, though it were in the halls of hell,
What thou lovest well is thy true heritage
What thou lov'st well shall not be reft from thee

This from Kevin Killian today.  I don't know anything beyond the reported fa=

It feels right to consider doing a tribute out of the Poetry Center.
Enormous outreach he had with that work.

                              out to rock on the horizon as if the
thing out there were already in here with us,
                              screaming--something I'm not
doing--"there, O there!," beneath which all our tenses
                              buckle and our phrases all give way.>>


RUMORED PLACE "conveys the intolerable crush of the ongoing, the
grand brawl of contending institutions and concepts hectically alive
past their deaths.  Meanwhile the self continually gains and loses
ID.  The intensity of what is said displays the extent of what can't
be said."
--Robert  Gl=FCck

"With an extraordinary soulful ferocity, Rob Halpern's new work
commits itself to a lyric interrogation of power...Sustained and yet
overcome by their porousness, the poems struggle in the grasp of our
violent polity--indeed, they register defeat, even as they bring into
relation incommensurate scales of experience--erotic, economic,
political...exhilarating, and edged with grief."
--Camille Roy

"RUMORED PLACE risks itself in its entirety at every turn...finally,
a place from which one day to have begun!"

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK
A satire of Laura Bush, with a dose of affection
By Mark Swed
Times Staff Writer

September 2, 2004

NEW YORK — The streets of this Democrat-dominated town are not
unexpectedly filled with righteous anti-Republican rage right now. But
just as common is humor. There seems to be no end of ways to parody
President Bush on T-shirts and banners. Typical are the unprintable
one-liners making fun of the president's and vice president's names.
Business in the double-entendre is booming.

And then there is Tony Kushner.

The playwright of "Angels in America" and "Homebody/Kabul" has contributed
a substantial, sophisticated, hilarious yet surprisingly affectionate
satire of Laura Bush. The three scenes that Kushner has written for "Only
We Who Guard the Mystery Shall be Happy" have had several previous
readings, and the first, in which Mrs. Bush reads to the ghosts of Iraqi
children, was published in the Nation last year. But Tuesday night, while
the real Mrs. Bush addressed the Republican convention, there was an
exceptional reading of Kushner's scenes a couple of miles away at the New
York Theatre Workshop, where Holly Hunter and Cynthia Nixon took turns
impersonating the first lady.

Like many intellectuals, Kushner views Laura Bush, a former teacher and
librarian, as an enigma. Her husband is not known to share her love of
language and literature. If Dostoevsky is, as she claims, her favorite
writer, how can a woman attracted to contemplating the great Russian
novelist's complex characters and moral issues accept the less ambiguous
rhetoric that comes out of the White House?

For the surreal first scene, Hunter portrayed a wide-eyed Mrs. Bush
addressing the dead Iraqi children, victims of American attacks or
sanctions. Nixon was an angel, and since the actresses were simply reading
from their scripts in street clothes, a third actress, comedian Lisa Kron,
set the scene and read the stage directions.

All children, even dead ones, can learn to love books, Mrs. Bush tells her
audience. She then goes on to describe why "The Brothers Karamazov" means
so much to her. But as the suffering in Dostoevsky begins to touch tender
spots in her own psyche, her defenses break down. She finally admits that
she is a woman of subtlety stuck with a simpleton.

What in the world would Mrs. Bush herself think of this audacious fantasy?
That's Kushner's even brasher next scene, in which the first lady
confronts the playwright after having seen the first scene. Now played by
Nixon, Mrs. Bush is elegantly poised, indignant and smart as she cuttingly
jousts with Kush- ner, the role Hunter now assumes (wearing one of those
anti-Bush T-shirts with unprintable slogans). Art, Mrs. Bush expounds, has
nothing to do with politics, and Dostoevsky, in particular, was a
visionary who transcended politics. Perhaps, she says, it is not the
president who is simplistic — he actually gets things done — but rather
the Democrats, who debate much and do little, and even the playwright.

This Laura Bush also refuses to cede the moral high ground about Iraq,
accusing Kushner of wishing for more suffering in Iraq so that his
position can be proved right. "You wouldn't be happy if Iraq succeeded,"
she insists. Kushner denies it but is rattled.

Mrs. Bush also doesn't appreciate some two-bit comic like Kron reading
sarcastic descriptions of her in the stage directions. At this point, Kron
bursts in, tells off the first lady and then recounts an outrageous dream
she had about President Bush at the United Nations.

Hunter, Nixon and Kron were terrific, stimulating the imagination in a way
a full staging couldn't possibly equal.

Meanwhile, Kushner has managed the brilliant trick of taking Mrs. Bush
seriously while being wildly irreverent at the same time, the trick of
humanizing her for a partisan audience.

Candidate for the subversive

Another goofy, yet artistically interesting, parody of the current
administration is an exhibition on 57th Street, not far from some of the
fancier hotels hosting Republican delegates, that is getting considerable
attention.

The Luxe Gallery has been turned into "The Experimental Party
Disinformation Center." This room full of flashing television monitors and
skewered political sloganeering is Abe Golan's campaign headquarters. If
elected president, he promises, he will "subvert the dominant paradigm."
If you want somebody "who is willing to gnaw into the body politic," Abe
is your man.

This multimedia show, designed to reveal what "representation through
virtualization" might be like, has perhaps too little of Kush- ner's
nuance. But it does at least present the prospect that if the Department
of Works, Mixologies and Transformations got its hands on us, Republicans
and Democrats alike would all be pounded by a fractured, frantic,
tantalizing beat.

And you were worried about the Patriot Act?

 If you thought the "I can protect you" rhetoric in Bush's speech last nigh=
t
was at odds with well and not so well-known recorded facts, the article
(below)in today's Independent (London) provides a pretty devastating accoun=
t
of this demonstration's performance purely by the numbers. Or, in case you
think similar to myself that we are being ruled by evangelical crusaders -
Bush even used the word "Resurrection" - intertwined with rookie political
performers and downright crooks, these numbers ought to do the overwhelming
- I could hardly make it to the end -  trick. May Kerry & Edwards use them
to burn multiple holes in that hologram of a Hallmark calendar
picture-boy/dad in Church that filled the screen last night.
Compassionately, of course.

This is an edited extract from "What We've Lost", by Graydon Carter,
published by Little Brown on 9 September

ABOUT THE AUTHOR=20

For a former college drop-out from Ontario and, briefly, a lineman stringin=
g
up telegraph wires on the railways of Canada, Graydon Carter, 55, has risen
to impressive heights. The editor of Vanity Fair since 1992 =FA after
succeeding Tina Brown =FA he is one of America's celebrity editors with clout=
,
glamour and a nice line in suits.

It is hard to imagine Carter doing physical work of any kind, beyond
exercising his thumb on his silver Zippo lighter. His labour is restricted
to rejigging headlines in his magazine =FA he is a self-confessed failure at
delegation of duties =FA and swanning to Manhattan parties. Martini in hand,
he cuts an almost princely and dandyish figure, with billowing shirts and
similarly billowing silver hair.

The spotlight on his activities has never burned brighter. In recent months
he has transformed the regular editor's letter at the front of the magazine
into less of a chat about its coming contents =FA the spreads of Annie
Leibowitz and rants of Christopher Hitchens =FA and more a full-bore diatribe
against the world of George Bush.=20

                           September 3, 2004

=20

I urge you to put out ads that educate the public about Bush's lies. =
Please consider the following two possibilities.

=20

How do we have a doctrine of freedom for the whole world when we deny =
even our Bill of Rights for our own citizens? Freedom of peaceful =
assembly, freedom of speech.=20

They say they are the party of compassion? There will be an out-pouring =
of homeless on the streets of our country because the Bush =
administration  is removing funding for low-cost housing in the cities =
to support wealthy land-developers. Tens of thousands have died in =
Bush's wars while they use our young soldiers as fodder, undercutting =
their benefits and pay and requiring added tours of duty. Our soldiers =
are left exposed to attack in Afghanistan and Iraq alongside the =
imprisoning and torture of Iraqi and Afghani citizens and soldiers, who =
are not given legal recourse in circumstances that are human rights =
violations. These violations have been recently challenged by our =
courts, the challenge opposed by Bush's administration-any impropriety =
denied by Rumsfeld though corroborated by his own commission. Are we to =
be snowed by lies, so many lies we cannot even keep track?

=20

And the following possibility for an ad:

=20

Despite the fact that the 9/11 Commission found there to be no weapons =
of mass destruction that could threaten America and no link between Iraq =
and Al Qaida-claims that were the basis of the Bush administration's war =
on Iraq-54% of our public still believes in this misinformation. We must =
be strong enough to see the truth: that we have been duped by the Bush =
administration and by some of the news media. Bush's policies do not =
benefit the common people of America, nor are they welcomed by the =
common people of Afghanistan and Iraq whose countries have been =
destroyed, the promised reparations of which are beyond our means. Our =
prosperity and our system of justice are being swept away.

As a veteran campaign manager  of over 17 winning
state assembly campaigns, I have to say it is time for
Kerry's campaign to be willing to go for the jugular, and
to slit a few other veins along the way.

His campaign needs to learn the value of attack advsertising.
The truest spots, the most factual spots are the negative and
comparative. Attack spots (as well as direct snail and electronic
mail) draw the sharpest contrasts. And at the end of the day
Kerry has an obligation to let the voters know the differences.
When his campaign helps the electorate do that, than it'll be
a good (for us all).

It's time for:


*(Advertising tone): "Bush doesn't want to take care of older
Americans who have worked hard all their lives.... he wants to
abolish Social Security,... is that what you want?"

*(Advertising tone): "While we loose jobs here at home, Bush
is creating jobs in Iraq,... is that what we want?"

*(Advertising tone): "Our jobless rate is at an all time high, ... if
George W. Bush doesn't understand the problem, how can he solve
it?"

* (Advertising tone): "George Bush has done nothing to bring jobs
back to Ohio. But he sure has done a lot to ship them overseas to
China and elsewhere."

You may not like the means, but the ends (restoring our country on
Nov. 2nd) are worth it.

Best,
Gerald Schwartz

Dear Kerry Team,
September 3, 2004



I urge you to put out ads that educate the public about Bush's lies. Please
consider the following two possibilities.



How do we have a doctrine of freedom for the whole world when we deny even
our Bill of Rights for our own citizens? Freedom of peaceful assembly,
freedom of speech.

They say they are the party of compassion? There will be an out-pouring of
homeless on the streets of our country because the Bush administration  is
removing funding for low-cost housing in the cities to support wealthy
land-developers. Tens of thousands have died in Bush's wars while they use
our young soldiers as fodder, undercutting their benefits and pay and
requiring added tours of duty. Our soldiers are left exposed to attack in
Afghanistan and Iraq alongside the imprisoning and torture of Iraqi and
Afghani citizens and soldiers, who are not given legal recourse in
circumstances that are human rights violations. These violations have been
recently challenged by our courts, the challenge opposed by Bush's
administration-any impropriety denied by Rumsfeld though corroborated by his
own commission. Are we to be snowed by lies, so many lies we cannot even
keep track?



And the following possibility for an ad:



Despite the fact that the 9/11 Commission found there to be no weapons of
mass destruction that could threaten America and no link between Iraq and Al
Qaida-claims that were the basis of the Bush administration's war on
Iraq-54% of our public still believes in this misinformation. We must be
strong enough to see the truth: that we have been duped by the Bush
administration and by some of the news media. Bush's policies do not benefit
the common people of America, nor are they welcomed by the common people of
Afghanistan and Iraq whose countries have been destroyed, the promised
reparations of which are beyond our means. Our prosperity and our system of
justice are being swept away.

"Writing for the sake of experimentalism gives us
writing no better or worse than writing for the sake
of rhyme, or tradition, or laundry detergent."

Wrong.  Trying something new, significantly new, gives
us a successful or failed experiment--to provide a
path to follow or not follow.  Hence, any truly
experimental poem is of greater value for furthering
the art than any standard poem.

Don't expect more from me on this for a while.  I'm
still without Internet at home due to Hurricane
Charley, and don't get access to it easily.

Bob:

I don't think what you're saying makes sense.

If writing for the sake of experimentalism gives us a successful or failed
experiment, how is that better than writing for the sake of rhyme? Writing
for the sake of rhyme gives us either a good or bad poem, just as writing
for the sake of experimentalism gives us either a good or bad poem. The
stakes may be higher (furthering, if you believe it, the state of poetry as
a whole) when writing for experimentalism, but that says nothing about the
poem itself.

But if the Russian Formalist argument is valid, then any poem is in
interplay with the entirety of the tradition of poetry, and is measured by
how it works within and against that context. In this measure, any
poem--written for the sake of experimentalism or not--is an experiment, and
provides a path to follow or not follow. Tradition, of course, is not
stagnant, especially not if there can be a tradition of experimentalism,
which is what you have if new paths of poetry are followed. And this isn't
to say that poetry written for the sake of tradition is any better, either.
My point is only that the poems I like tend to be written for the sake of
themselves, and whether they end up as traditional, experimental, or
anything else is a manifestation of that sake, rather than the sake itself.

I hope that's clear. It's kind of late.

Lucas

one  has to experiment  and failed experiments lead to more experiments
that's why they too are important  ok lunkhead a failed rhyme  will
certainly lead to other rhymes and maybe even for similar intentions  but
 experiments  are like vaccines  you do it til you get it right and voila
 there's still polio in the world but not where the successful experiment
 was aloud  oops allowed to take root  there it only flourishes  gets
improved upon  added to  and if all goes well an entire new genre grows
within the larger gene pool  everything's an experiment any way  until it
succeeeds 100oo00 percent  take democracy for instance an experiment
that 's failed ( or keeps failing) time and time again  but every now and
then it gets improved upon as bits of it takes route in the psyche and
elsewhere  ( you tell me where else where is ) i should go on  and can
but i've been at this fking machine about 5 hrs now mostly  experimenting
(w myself & others ) and boy am i  busheddddddd

boy am i glad sometimes that i'm a dummy

i feel less afraid of dying than i did last  week

Wondering if anyone has seen one anywhere as yet. I've been checking the SF
Chronicle and NY Times online, as well as googling, and haven't turned one
up, which is surprising to say the least.

> Why Democrats shouldn't be scared
> By Michael Moore
> September 3, 2004
>
> NEW YORK - If I've heard it once, I've heard it a hundred times from
> discouraged Democrats and liberals as the Republican convention here
> wrapped up this week. Their shoulders hunched, their eyes at a droop,
> they lower their voice to a whisper hoping that if they don't say it
> too loud it may not come true: "I...I...I think Bush is going to win."
>
> Clearly, they're watching too much TV. Too much of Arnold
> Schwarzenegger, Zell Miller, Dick Cheney and Rudy Giuliani. Too much
> of swift boat veterans and Fox News commentators.
>
> Action heroes always look good on TV. On Wednesday night, the GOP even
> made an action-hero video and showed it at the convention. There was
> White House political czar Karl Rove and other administration
> officials dressed up for "war" and going through boot camp on the
> National Mall in Washington.

>
> I could only sit there in the convention hall and wish this were the
> real thing: Rove, national security adviser Condi Rice and Co. being
> sent to Iraq, and our boys and girls being brought home. But then the
> lights came up, and everyone sitting in the Bush family box was having
> a grand ol' hoot and a holler at the video they just saw.
>
> For some reason, all of this has scared the bejabbers out of the
> Democrats. I can hear the wailing and moaning from Berkeley, Calif.,
> to Cambridge, Mass. The frightening scenes from the convention have
> sent John Kerry's supporters looking for the shovels so they can dig
> their underground bunkers in preparation for another four years of the
> Dark Force.
>
> I can't believe all of this whimpering and whining. Kerry has been
> ahead in many polls all summer long, but the Republicans come to New
> York for one week off-Broadway and suddenly everyone is dressed in
> mourning black and sitting shivah?
>
> Exactly what moment was it during the convention that convinced them
> that the Republicans had now "connected" with the majority of
> Americans and that it was all over? Arnold praising Richard Nixon?
> Ooooh, that's a real crowd-pleaser. Elizabeth Dole decrying the
> removal of the Ten Commandments from a courthouse wall in Alabama?
> Yes, that's a big topic of conversation in the unemployment line in
> Akron, Ohio. Georgia Sen. Miller, a Democratic turncoat, looking like
> Freddy Krueger at an all-girls camp? His speech - and the look on what
> you could see of his strangely lit face - was enough for parents to
> send small children to their bedrooms.
>
> My friends - and I include all Democrats, independents and recovering
> Republicans in this salutation - do not be afraid. Yes, the Bush
> Republicans huff and they puff, but they blow their own house down.
>
> As many polls confirm, a majority of your fellow Americans believe in
> your agenda. They want stronger environmental laws, are strong
> supporters of women's rights, favor gun control and want the war in
> Iraq to end.
>
> Rejoice. You're already more than halfway there when you have the
> public on board. Just imagine if you had to go out and do the work to
> convince the majority of Americans that women shouldn't be paid the
> same as men. All they ask is that you put up a candidate for president
> who believes in something and fights for those beliefs.
>
> Is that too much to ask?
>
> The Republicans have no idea how much harm they have done to
> themselves. They used to have a folk-hero mayor of New York named Rudy
> Giuliani. On 9/11, he went charging right into Ground Zero to see whom
> he could help save. Everyone loved Rudy because he seemed as though he
> was there to comfort all Americans, not just members of his own party.
>
> But in his speech to the convention this week, he revised the history

>
> As chaos ensued, "spontaneously, I grabbed the arm of then-police

> is our president.' And I say it again tonight, 'Thank God George Bush
> is our president.' "
>
> Please.
>
> There were the sub-par entertainers nobody knew. There was the show of
> "Black Republicans," "Arab-American Republicans" and other minorities
> they trot out to show how much they are loved by groups their policies
> abuse.
>
> And there were the Band-Aids. The worst display of how out of touch
> the Republicans are was those Purple Heart Band-Aids the delegates
> wore to mock Kerry over his war wounds, which, for them, did not spill
> the required amount of blood.
>
> What they didn't seem to get is that watching at home might have been
> millions of war veterans feeling that they were being ridiculed by a
> bunch of rich Republicans who would never send their own offspring to
> die in Fallujah or Danang.
>
> Kerry supporters and Bush-bashers should not despair. These

Hi all, Sparrow wrote this for the Woodstock Times.

Brenda Coultas


At the Largest Demonstration Outside a Political Convention in American
History

I decided to protest the Republican National Convention, although I
feared the worst.  The march would begin on 14th Street; I expected a
terrorist attack on 22nd Street, a counter-terrorist attack on 27th
Street, another terrorist attack on 32nd Street, and so on.  Nonetheless,
I refused to be frightened.  "I defy the fear-messages of my Government,
even if they're true!" I resolved.  On Friday, August 27, I took the bus
to Manhattan from my mountain town of Phoenicia, New York.

On Saturday (the day before the march), a disembodied voice on the number
4 subway announced: "If you see an unattended package, please report it
immediately to the authorities."  Near me, a Hispanic man was handing out
stickers that read "Dubya Dubya Dubya BushOnCrack.com."  "There was a
Hopi prophecy of the 'fall of the House of Mica,'" he explained loudly.=20
"Everyone thought this would be the United Nations, but it was the World
Trade Center!"

But New Yorkers did not fear strife on Sunday.  They are cynical even
about terrorism.  When I mentioned my fears, New Yorkers would smile, as
if it was naive to predict disaster.  Disaster will come, they know, when
it feels like coming.

Sunday morning, I made this sign on the subway:

LE TH=C9=C2TRE DU MAL=20
DOIT ARR=CAT=C9

("The Theatre of Evil Must End").

Out of the subway, I saw a film crew on 21st Street shooting three
protesters holding a large word-balloon sign that said "It's Not Right!"=20
I stopped to watch, and the assistant cameraman asked: "Would you like to
go next?"

"Sure," I replied, uncertain what I was agreeing to.

"This is a promotional shot for the new Al Franken TV show," the
cameraman explained.  Soon I found myself holding the sign and smiling
into the camera.  I tried 14 different intonations of the slogan:
"It's... not... right!"  "It's Not Right?"  "It's notright."  "It's not
RIGHT!!"  (And because I carried a sign in French, I was allowed to also
perform the French version: "Ce n'est pas vrai!")

"You were great!" the cameraman enthused.  I signed a release and walked
into the march.

Somehow Fate had chosen me to make a Leftist commercial.

When I entered the march, I immediately realized it was not a march.  It
was somewhere between a "creep" and a "standstill."  (" I went to the
protest creep yesterday.")  There were so many people, one could hardly
move.  I am no crowd-estimation expert, but I would say at least 250,000
people must have been present.

Somehow, despite my non-progress, I felt intuitively that I had chosen
the right spot to enter the rally.  I looked around, to find the meaning
of my intuition, but saw no obvious clue.

Then a tall woman turned to me: "I know you!"  She was from The Bob, a
commune near Rhinebeck, several of whose members had attended my birthday
party.  Around her was The Bob's affinity group, Hummer With A Pool.=20
(The Bob is fascinated with Humvee stretch limousines, which sometimes
include small swimming pools.)  In fact, some of the affinity group were
now chanting: "Don't mess with perfection!  Cancel the election!"=20
Another carried a sign: "Draft Me So I Can Kill Legally."

We came to a corner, where a pile of garbage had accumulated.  Two
members of the Hummer With A Pool whipped out large plastic bags and
began furiously picking up the detritus, chanting: "The People, United,
Will Throw Trash All over the Ground!  The People, United, Will Throw
Trash All over the Ground!"  A policeman eyed them them suspiciously, as
I advised, "They just enjoy cleaning up."

"Whatever they want to do," the cop replied stoically.

I was distracted by a group of ukulele players singing "Aloha, George!"
in unison.  When I looked around, Hummer With A Pool was gone.

I began writing down funny signs:

REPUBLICANS
FOR VOLDEMORT

BUSH: LIKE A ROCK
ONLY DUMBER

IF YOU CAN READ THIS,
YOU'RE NOT THE PRESIDENT

GOD TOLD ME NOT TO=20
VOTE FOR BUSH

DOLLY PARTON
FOR BENEVOLENT DICTATOR

Suddenly, Hummer With A Pool was back, moving up from behind.  "Where
were you?" I asked one bearded youth.

"A camera crew from MTV followed us for awhile," he explained.

I continue writing down the signs:

NYC TO RNC:
DROP DEAD

NOT MY DAUGHTER
IF NOT YOURS

GANDOLF
FOR PRESIDENT

NOT IN OUR TOWN

FERMEZ
LA BUSH

DOPE IS ON
THE WAY

Hummer With A Pool began to chant: "Bush killed Christ!"

More signs:

LICK BUSH
BEAT DICK

BUSH IS SCARY,
VOTE FOR KERRY

4 MORE MONTHS

I looked around and Hummer With A Pool was gone again.  The march had
moved into the hot sunshine of 32nd Street, and completely slowed.  I
took out the "Word Strength" column of The New York Post, which I had
brought in case of boredom.  According to "Word Strength," at least 19
five-letter words may be formed with the letters of the word "deduction."
I began finding the words:

coded      tuned
noted       cited
tonic        dined
diced       toned
tunic

Now we had reached Madison Square Garden, where the Republican National
Convention would begin tomorrow.  "Shame!  Shame!  Shame!" chanted the
crowd.

Near me, I noticed a man with a stack of orange fliers.  "May I have
one?" I asked.  He nodded, and handed me one.

World Tribunal on Iraq

was the title.  "The images of bombs falling like grapes from the sky and
children playing in barrels of uranium... and the failure to provide
security, water, and health and to protect the ancient cultural property
of Iraq shatters my heart: I hold a human shame, a sorrow that is so vast
and so deep there is a physical aching in all of me... What gives me hope
is the will of the people.  We will win this struggle, there is no
alternative," I read.  This was a quote from Eve Ensler, who wrote "The
Vagina Monologues."  She participated in the New York Session of the
World Tribunal on Iraq on May 8.  Tribunals in 16 cities around the world
will "hold the Bush administration and its allies accountable for their
actions." The website is www.worldtribunal.org.  For information, write
info@world tribunal-nyc.org.

I asked someone the time.  "3:35," he said.  I was supposed to read poems
at the Bowery Poetry Club at 4!  I extricated myself from the crowd, and
headed into the subway.

At the poetry bar, I read this poem:

Le president

Le president
aime Dieu
et la guerre.

Pour lui, les
deux ne font=20
qu'un:

le Dieuguerre.


The President

The President
loves God
and War.

For him, the
two are one:=20

GodWar.

Donald M. Allen, editor of poetry anthologies
-
Saturday, September 4, 2004


(09-04) 20:42 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --

Donald M. Allen, a poetry editor who celebrated the Beat writers, edited Jack Kerouac and published an acclaimed anthology of American poetry, died Aug. 29 in San Francisco after suffering from pneumonia. He was 92.

Allen, who was born in the small town of Cherokee, Iowa, had a lifelong interest in literature. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in English literature from the University of Iowa and taught English for many years.

He first made a name for himself as editor at Grove Press in New York, where he published the acclaimed anthology, "The New American Poetry 1945-1960." The collection introduced writers from the Beat Generation and the New York and Black Mountain schools.

"I think Donald was the best editor for poetry of the last few decades. He put certain poets on the map and put a more experimental, avant-garde poetry on the map," Marjorie Perloff, author and professor emeritus at Stanford, where some of Allen's manuscripts and correspondence are housed. Others of his papers are held at the University of California, San Diego.

Allen edited Kerouac's "Mexico City Blues" and the San Francisco issue of Evergreen Review, which contained the first separate printing of Allen Ginsberg's poem "Howl."

He also founded two influential literary presses, Grey Fox Press and Four Seasons Foundation, which published Gary Snyder, Kerouac, Ginsberg, O'Hara, Robert Duncan, Philip Whalen, Philip Lamantia, Lew Welch and Joanne Kyger. The presses also published works on philosophy, Buddhism and seminal gay and lesbian titles. Allen also edited author Richard Brautigan's first four books.

"Donald always stayed around poets and was really entertained by them," said poet Barbara Guest. "He was always gathering the poets together and listening to their stories. He just simply enjoyed the conversation. He encouraged people."

Mr. Allen's sister, Kathryn Payne, said her brother had a full and rich life. The life spanned from the town of 7,000 people in rural Iowa to China, where he taught English. "He was very intelligent and as long as I can remember was interested in books," Payne said.

Mr. Allen was the oldest of the family's five children. Payne, who is 88, is the surviving family member.

CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS:
Freehand

Freehand is a journal devoted to handwritten work.  We are
interested in poetry and short prose, marginalia, drafts,
letters, journal entries, work that is composed entirely in
longhand, work drafted on unconventional materials (such as
napkins, envelopes, postcards), mixtures of writing and print,
and work that explores the interstices between writing and
drawing.  We are deeply interested in issues of  legibility, the
creative process, and the handmade vs. mechanical aspects of
writing.  We are not presently seeking out "found" prose/poetry
or calligraphic examples of already published work, although we
are open to persuasion.  Neatness doesn’t necessarily count;
neither does sloppiness.  Freehand also seeks to publish essays
that touch upon the above topics (we prefer if these are typed).

Submissions are read from September 1 through January 1, 2005.
Please include a SASE.  Please query us first concerning
electronic submissions at freehandjournal@ yahoo.com.  All
originals will be returned to author.  Expected date of
publication for Freehand #1:  May 1, 2005.

making and politics of his new Twin Tower based 'graphic novel' and the head
to head of Amy Goodman (Democracy Now) and John Fund (conservative) is an
interesting contrast to Fox news reporters getting rocked on the shore by
Frances (some version of impending Apocalyptic 'Rapture'?)  The double "A"s
- Art and Amy are a breath of fresh air.

USE THE ABORTION ISSUE TO DIVIDE AND CONQUER
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

THAT=92S RIGHT DIVIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
AMONG THEMSELVES

LET THEM FINISH THEMSELVES OFF

REPUBLICAN INFIGHTING WILL SHRINK THEIR
POWER BASE

Liberal Democrats traditionally avoid the issue of abortion
and abortion rights hoping it will just go away. No Democrat
and for that matter quite a few conservatives don't want
to ever outlaw medical abortion.

Liberal Democrats don=92t usually want to discuss the issue of
abortion because it=92s been used by the Conservative
Republicans as a political weapon.

The difference now is there are a higher percentage
of moderate Republicans who don=92t want to outlaw
abortion. Their constituencies would never stand for
that. If they ever took a stance against abortion that
would be the beginning of the end for their political
careers. September 11 drew many to the Republican
party because the Republicans tout themselves as
being strong on defense, thus better for national security
and more effective defenders of America.

DON=92T ENTER INTO THE DEFENSE DEBATE
WITH THE REPUBLICANS--THEY WILL BEAT
THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT AT THIS DEBATE
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

Instead Democrats need to keep bringing up the
issue of abortion and abortion rights. This is the
Achilles heel of the Republican party. Times have
changed indeed. There are huge numbers of women
in this country that would be up in arms overnight
at the thought that  Bush=92s reelection means the
end of legal abortion. Whether Bush actually plans
to do this is beside the point. Republicans have to be
pinned down to this issue. If Bush and his Republican
cronies disagree with the platform of the Christian
Coalition which is vehemently anti-abortion their power
base will crumble as they find that the supposed
=93stars=94 of the Republican party Guiliani and
Schwarzenegger don=92t want to outlaw abortion.
Schwarzenegger is the most visible Republican
after Bush and Guiliani is being quietly prepped
to take the helm in 2008!

Democrats need to use the abortion issue to polarize
the Republican party and cast them as the true
extremists they really are. SPLIT THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY.

DEMOCRATS NEED TO FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE.

This need to happen in a very VOCAL WAY!

COPY AND PASTE THIS E-MAIL TO JOHN KERRY
IF YOU AGREE ... FOLLOW THE BELOW LINK.

FORWARD THIS TO FRIENDS.

DIVIDE AND CONQUER!

Undaunted: A Poetic Journey is a collection of Elliot Torres's poems
from the age of 22-27. The journey begins, where Five Years of Solitary
left off. It illustrates the author's emotional and professional growth.
The book is divided into five sections: IMAGENATION, BEHIND CLOSED
DOORS,  LOVE DEFINED, IN NEED OF REPAIR and DECADE. Each section touches
on topics of image, sex, love, love lost, and looking back at the last
10 years.



      Elliot Torres was born and raised in Waukegan, Illinois. He moved
      to New York City alone at the age of 17 in May of 1994. He
      attended Pace University where he graduated in 1998 with a BA in
      Communications. He has worked behind the scenes in the fashion,
      music, television, and magazine industries. His experiences have
      taken him throughout the U.S., the Caribbean and Mexico.

      In the summer of 2002, his debut collection of poetry, "Five Years
      of Solitary" was released to an enthusiastic response. It
      chronicled his experiences in New York City as a gay Puerto Rican
      man from the age of 17-22. "Undaunted: A Poetic Journey" is an
      account  of the second phase of his life in New York City. The
      volume, comprised of 76 poems, takes readers  on a journey through
      this young writer's emotional and professional growth from the age
      of 22-27. Elliot Torres resides in New York City.

Undaunted will be released in October 2004.  Please visit
www.ElliotTorres.com to learn more about the author and his work.

I am touched by the quantity and quality of contributions, I would
like to add that Giovanna Mulas, very young since she was born in
1969, was short-listed for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and sent two
books for the Corner, a long essay, and two short stories. Her
generosity goes beyond limits.

I am pleased I finally got in contact with Fan Ogilvie, whose poems I
first read on Fulcrum 2, her exotic name and surreal =E2=80=93 clean style
have stayed with me for long. The same with Rae Armantrout, whose work
I evaluate as honest, precise, religious, if this adjective still has
any quality.

I was an honor to meet Philip Fried and Alan Sondheim, the commitment
of whom I respect. John Tranter, the Australian par excellence, well
known for his incredible magazine: Jacket, and heaps of books, my
thanks for taking your time to send me some poems.

And Jennifer L. Lesh, who is back to writing after years, her poems
are beautiful & fresh, her mirrored projection. As it is for Eileen
Tabios, la Chatelaine of the web. As per Susanne Tooth, I got in
contact with her through Jos=C3=A9 Koser, who met her in Caracas.

A special acknowledgement to Chris Murray for her continuous support
and new wonderful work, as to Jon Corelis who has much contributed
with poems and translations (Ovid, Sulpicia, Bertran de Born, Horace,
Callimachus, and Nikephoros Vrettakos).

Joanna Boulter, who celebrated in these days the third birthday of her
and her husband's Roger Collett publishing house, Arrowhead Press,
reminded me that this is about the time the Poets' Corner was first
opened, a full long year - well to be precise - one year and about one
month ago. An enormous bottle of sparkling drinks for us all who are

Behind the narrator's question, "Will they ever trust us again?," framed
by the 1984 reference to the continuous war without an identifiable
enemy--and the frame itself should alert the viewer to the suggestion
that there is a final war somewhere in the future against an enemy that
can be identified--the third-person plural collapses officer corps,
career soldiers and (economic) conscripts into a single mass and
militarized body: 'they' are the ones that defend the flag. Nationalism
is cooking in the kitchen of the working-class mom. "Charles Maurras
(1868-1952) was a French writer and political theorist whose 'integral
nationalism' anticipated some of the ideas of fascism." (Note 17 from
the Notes to "The Present Social Situation of the French Writer" written
April-June 1933 and January 1934, in Benjamin's Selected Writings, vol.
2).

Belonging to the first-person plural in the question of trust are the
civilians who enjoy the privileges of citizenship while relying on the
military here almost a metonym for the working class to defend and
perpetuate their privileges. The haves and the have-mores and the
have-nots. Social contradictions are resolved by the one division which
solves nothing: rich and poor. An unjust war brutalizes the sons and
daughters of the noble poor, suggesting again the just war and the
dignity, not to mention heroism, that can be obtained in the conduct of
just the right war. What war is being projected by this film as the just
war that will defend America and for which is needed a united military
undeceived by its leaders and respected by civilians?

The collage sequence illustrating "The Coalition of the Willing" gives a
good example of what a politics without internationalism looks like, and
at the level of the caricature of the ridiculous and underdeveloped or
underarmed foreign other, named here as the republics of Belau, Costa
Rica, Iceland, Morocco, Romania, Afghanistan and the Netherlands, at
least half of the images depict some form of near stone-age productive
labor. An explicit message of cultural and technological superiority,
though at least for the postmodern sensibility, aren't vampires funny?

"Kracauer's pictorial wit is no chance affair, but is related to those
composite Surrealist images that not only characterize dreams (as we
have learned from Freud) and the sensual world (as we have learned from
Paul Klee and Max Ernst), but also define our social reality." (From
Benjamin's review of Die Angestellten, Selected Writings, vol. 2).
Perhaps there's a more sophisticated reading of the Coalition of the
Willing collage, one that might address the interiority of the cinematic
reference and parody of the process by which other countries, languages
and cultures are imagined in the collective popular fantasy and
addressing this, contextualize the reductivist accusation that the
images are simply offensive. Politically, they are false.

In his "Reply to Oscar A.H. Schmitz" Benjamin argued about another film,
that it could be "objectively discussed either as film or from a
political point of view." Whoever Schmitz was, he apparently did
neither. All these anachronistic details from outdated debates. What
does Brecht's Die Mutter have to do with the director/narrator of
Fahrenheit 9/11 standing in a working-class kitchen in Flint, Michigan,
saying "It's a great country."

Introductory Remarks on a Series for Humanity: "I belong to the
generation that is now between thirty and forty years old. The
intelligentsia of this generation will presumably be the last for a long
time to have enjoyed a completely unpolitical education. The war caught
its most left-leaning elements in the camp of a more or less radical
pacifism. The history of Germany in the postwar period is in part the
history of the revolutionary education of this original left-bourgeois
wing of the intelligentsia." (Selected Writings, vol. 2, p. 20).

It has been a long time, and for many of the writers of the present
generation between thirty and forty years old can it be said they have
enjoyed an unpolitical education? The manifold responses to such a
question depend on a deep understanding of the politicizing event and
whether or not even a war operates as such an event and catalyst for
changing the feel and shape of the ground that one walks on. As for the
generation of writers that came out of the Vietnam war, their forest of
publications and exemplary polemics--what can be learned there on the
eve of the return of the Love of Nation and National Defense? Or is that
too personal a question? Can the analogy be made between Germany's
defeat in WWI and the defeat of the U.S. in Vietnam? Or is such an
analogy as wild a surmise as glancing at the contemporary architecture
of Warsaw and thinking for a moment just how profitable for global
capital was the holocaust.

Theories of German Fascism: "One can call this the latest stage because
these attempts to come to terms with the loss of the war show a clear
pattern. These attempts began with an effort to pervert the German
defeat into an inner victory by means of confession of guilt, which were
hysterically elevated to the universally human. This political position,
which supplied the manifestos for the course of the decline of the West,
was the faithful reflection of the German 'revolution' by the
Expressionist avant-garde. Then came the attempt to forget the lost war.
The bourgeoisie turned over, to snore on its other side--and what pillow
could have been softer than the novel?" Or, what pillow could have been
softer than post-70s theories of form?

Or is the reverse equally applicable, and can the first-person narration
in a documentary-collage declaring itself to have a politics of
opposition be critiqued with various versions of a post-expressive
poetics that would make suspect, to say the least, the placement of the
narrator inside one's film at the same time pretending to be capable of
acts of observation? Was that a 70s documentary, American Family?
Something about how the camera itself intervened in the social reality
it was filming, constructing (not documenting) that social reality as it
was filming. Where are these boundaries in Fahrenheit 9/11?

Reviews of Books and Others that I like


Here's the latest selection of works that have fascinated me. Not all are
new - I feel I should apologize a bit for the enthusiasm -

Giant Brains, or Machines that Think, Edmund C. Berkeley, John Wiley,
1949. This is the first book written to make computers understandable to
the general public. It covers both analog and digital machines, focusing
on Eniac, Simon, and other early implementations. Input and output
devices, delay lines, and various types of memory are described. The book
also discusses the future of computers. I find it completely fascinating -
my copy came from abe.com for $13 which is a bargain. Berkeley himself was
important in the early history of computing; he's not a popularizer.

The Beginnings of Japanese Art, Namio Egami, Weatherhill, 1973. This is
part of the Heibonsha Survey of Japanese Art - thirty some volumes, which
are now sold separately. They're wonderful - written by Japanese experts,
they cover periods and architectures in detail. This one focuses on Yayoi,
Jomon, tumuli, haniwa, etc. - brilliantly. The reproductions are good
enough for research. You can usually find the series at 2nd-hand bookshops
- check it out.

Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege, edited by
Geach and Black, Oxford, 1952. All my life I believed that Frege felt
'defeated' by Russell's paradox - that's clearly not the case, as
indicated by Frege's reply at length, translated here. The book is
difficult but still worth reading, not only as history, but as a valuable
analysis of sense and meaning, sign and symbol, and so forth.

We the Media: Grassroots Journalism By the People, For the People, Dan
Gillmor, O'Reilly, 7/94. O'Reilly's publications have always fascinated me
- their books on linux, more recently on Macs. They have been increasingly
presenting a phenomenology of 'porousness' - peer-to-peer, blogging, etc. -
books dealing with, not only open source, but open knowledge, open
knowledge management/manageriality, and here, open journalism. You could
see this at work at the recent 'republican' convention demonstrations; you
can see it every day on the Net. I love this book. Parts of it seem overly
simplistic or optimistic - but it's all we have, in a way - this form of
_breathing_ and exchange that involves webcams, camera phones, sms, blogs,
and almost daily new forms of journalism and journalistic expertise. Do
check out this book; it gives one both guidelines and a sense of hope in
terms of the future of free information and information-dissemination.

Vel, Alan Sondheim, BlazeVOX, 2004. I had to put this in; it's the second
publish-on-demand work I've had, and looks beautiful. It still awaits
blurbs and intro, but is available now. Contents cover the phenomenology
of motion capture and virtuality, as well as the application of equations
to texts. Some of my more difficult\tensioned work, but something I love
to read over again as well, unusual for me.

Islands in the Clickstream: Reflections on Life in a Virtual World,
Richard Thieme, Syngress, 2004 (distributed by O'Reilly). Richard Thieme
was an Episcopal priest, and this book makes me happy (not necessarily
related). It reads like Teilhard de Chardin meets internetworking, without
any of de Chardin's metaphysical flights. It reminds me constantly of the
origin and potential of the net. These are columns from
www.thiemeworks.com but they're also 'writings' in the broadest sense of
the term. Chapters include Computer-Mediated Living: The Digital Filter;
Hacking and the Passion for Knowledge; Digital Spirituality; and Mostly
True Predictions. At this point on the Net, we need to feel better about
ourselves - need to remind ourselves of its positivity and potential for a
better world of close-to-transparent communications. I get tired of
deconstruction; this work moves in the other direction, and wisely.

The Best of SAILTrim, edited by Charles Mason, Sail, 1975 (1985). I'm not
a sailor, and never will be. When I'm taken on a sailboat, the world opens
up. Years ago I accidently made it to the Australian win in the America's
Cup at Newport - I was at the pre-race trials. Racing is a tricky
business, especially the construction and configuration of the sails
themselves - and this book describes the aerodynamics at work in detail. I
don't understand a lot of it - even the chapter titles can be arcane -
'The Mainsail Leech,' 'The Virtue of "Jiffy" Reefing,' and my favorite,
'The Boom Vang.' Needless to say this is really fun to read - I try to
'Picture a broach and knockdown aboard a distance racing yacht.' without
getting too far, but loving it.

Honkin' on Bobo, Aerosmith, 2004, Baby, Please Don't Go - and the first
time I heard this it _literally_ took my breath away.

I'm working my way through Sally Pryor's Postcards from Writing (pre-
release), www.sallypryor.com, which deals with graphemes, graphism, and
'the boundaries between written texts and pictures.' This is a cdrom which
takes a great deal of work, but is highly worthwhile - it's based on the
theories of Roy Harris, a highly controversial figure in contemporary
linguistics. I definitely recommend this - apologies for not completing
the work, but I wanted to get this out - and you could get in touch with
her at Sally Pryor <spryor@ozemail.com.au>. More later.

8 Ball Chicks, Gini Sikes, Knopf, 1998. I could not put this book down and
probably learned more about gang culture from it than from any other
source. It's not theoretical; it raises a lot of questions about the role
of author/ity that aren't quite answered, but what it offers is one of the
most intense reading/life experiences I've encountered.

http://jacketmagazine.com/25/bolivia.html : Forrest Gander and Kent
Johnson, Jaime Saenz, Some Days in the Life of The Night: Notes from
Bolivia, June 20-30, 2004 . This work deserves wide attention. Johnson's
project for years has been maurading the edge-phenomena of literature,
taste, poetry, and institutionalization; and here, Gander and Johnson (I
feel odd using last names) brilliantly construct and/or report on the
history/anthropology/phenomenology/literature of Jaime Saenz. Please give
this a read! This is not a review, but a request. So often, amazing works
like this are passed by - literature is growing exponentially on the web
(like everything else), and it's hard to track, hard to take the time. But
this piece, like everything in fact that the authors do, is worth it. I've
alway been fascinated by issues of authorship, especially when I'm ill at
ease in relation to them, and this is an instance. Saenz' relationship to
fascism is almost literally, uncanny. (The poetry, for example,
http://jacketmagazine.com/08/saenz-im.html , is rather brilliant too.)

The Nonsense Book of Riddles, Rhymes, Tongue Twisters, and Jokes from
American Folklore, edited by Duncan Emrich, illustrated by Eb Ohlsson,
Four Winds Press, 1970. An AMAZING collection, childhood Oulipo\Perec but
much more fun. Well, not really Oulipo/Perec, but I can't resist the
forward: 'I pity the river, / I pity the brook, / I pity the one that
takes this book.' (etc.)

In these dark times, it's best to look for a little light, at least enough
to fuel the residing despair into action. I'm rereading Sinclair Lewis' It
Can't Happen Here (from 1935), and its fictional account of the growth of
fascism in the US is far too familiar and convincing. So I'm also
rereading Gilgamesh in the Andrew George translation (Penguin 1999), which
is not only as complete as can be, but gives a lot of Sumerian material as
well. Check out both.

And in passing - The Logical Syntax of Language, Rudolf Carnap, Routledge,
1937 - perhaps because the orderly world appears beautiful; Maya Visual
Quickstart Guide, Danny Riddell and Andrew S. Britt, Peachpit, 2002,
becase these things allow me to work at a furious pace; Immersed in
Technology: Art and Virtual Environments, edited by Mary Anne Moser with
Douglas MacLeod, MIT, 1996, because it's prescient and the theory's great
(Hayles, Dyson, Stone, Ronell, and others); and Mary Shelley's The Last
Man - one of the strangest 19th-century books I've ever read -

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Hi,
I guess I should give a bit of context for this question. I read Harpers.
It's the only sensible thing coming out of America that I can get
regularly in print form for reading on the bus to and fro work.

The morning that I posted about Vendler and the NEH I had read Lapham's
piece "Tentacles of Rage: The Republican Propaganda Mill".

He mentions William Bennett and the NEH and its role in "culture wars". I
then saw a link to the Vendler piece and was curious as it was a speech
for the NEH. THe NEH homepage boasts a photo of Lynn Cheney and the
"Freedom" bookshelf. So I became curiouser and curiouser.

It seems to me from Bill Austin's (and others back channel) description
that the NEH is the US version of Canada's SSHRCC (pronounced shirk and
standing for Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council) and the NEA
is like the Canada Council for the Arts.

I just was wondering how ideologically driven the NEH was.

cheers,
kevin

DROWNED OUT

Directed by Franny Armstrong (2002, 75 min., UK) Armstrong's documentary
presents audiences with the three choices faced by the people of Jalsindhim
in central India: move to the slums in the city, accept a place at a
resettlement site or stay at home and drown. They must make a decision fast.
In the next few weeks, their village will disappear underwater as the giant
Narmada Dam fills. Bestselling author Arundhati Roy joins the fight against
the dam and asks the difficult questions: Will the water go to poor farmers
or to rich industrialists? What happened to the 16 million people displaced
by fifty years of dam building? Why should I care?

A Video+Text Installation from India's Raqs Media Collective

A/S/L (Age/Sex/Location) is a video+text installation on the lives of women

everyday journeys into cyberspace that hundreds of thousands of labouring
women make across the world. It is a document and a dramatization of the
questions that surround these daily migrations between online and off-line
worlds. It addresses the viewer with video, text and sound within the
framework of an on site installation.

character, generating scenes and, finally, how to make it all make sense.

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and
taverns!),mutilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented
forms. We will explore the structural possibilities of language to
ultimately answer the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning
and practiced poets will generate lots of original writing from this full
day of language play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye
with which to revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson Literary
Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the Arts, Mad
Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled notspeak.

Both the NEH and the NEA have always driven to the left or right depending on
whose in power.  They are, after all, government institutions funded by
taxpayer dollars.  These days conservatives rule the roost.  If a jury chooses work
that "offends" their constituents, the right will happily rescind the grant
-- and has done so in a number of cases.  Best, Bill

At the risk of being unfashionably non-ironic, I would
put in a good word for the NEH. I spent the summer on
an NEH grant at Princeton, where I spent six weeks
working on the Bernstein-Ferneyhough opera,
Shadowtime.  An excellent and rewarding time.

Hi,
I guess I should give a bit of context for this question=2E I read Harpers=
=2E
It's the only sensible thing coming out of America that I can get
regularly in print form for reading on the bus to and fro work=2E

The morning that I posted about Vendler and the NEH I had read Lapham's
piece "Tentacles of Rage: The Republican Propaganda Mill"=2E

He mentions William Bennett and the NEH and its role in "culture wars"=2E =
I
then saw a link to the Vendler piece and was curious as it was a speech
for the NEH=2E THe NEH homepage boasts a photo of Lynn Cheney and the
"Freedom" bookshelf=2E So I became curiouser and curiouser=2E

It seems to me from Bill Austin's (and others back channel) description
that the NEH is the US version of Canada's SSHRCC (pronounced shirk and
standing for Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council) and the NEA
is like the Canada Council for the Arts=2E

I just was wondering how ideologically driven the NEH was=2E

cheers,
kevin

the fellowships, yes, only go to writers

but the fellowships are by no means the largest part of NEA funding -- they
fund all of the arts in various ways

see <http://www.nea.gov>

The NEA also dispenses a lot of its money to state arts councils and
commissions, who then fund activities and organizations within the specific
states.

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT

=20
SURREALISM AND THE RADICAL IMAGINATION =AD=AD JANET HAMILL

Tuesdays at 7pm: 5 sessions begin October 12th
=B3Surrealism and the Radical Imagination=B2 will examine the complex nature of
imagination and its elements - illusionism, unreality, appearance, magic,
phantasm, fancy etc. - and the capacity of imagination to mediate between
the world of objective phenomena and subjective experience. The workshop
will look into the preoccupation of the Romanticists with imagination and
the sublime, the importance of the image to the Symbolists, and the
revolution brought about by the Surrealists to liberate poetic imagination
and take it to the realm of the marvelous.  Through means of Surrealist
games and methods, participants will be encouraged to cultivate their own
imaginations and enhance their imaginative writing skills.  A desire to
rescue poetry from some of its present unimaginative abuses is the only
requirement.

Janet Hamill has authored 4 books, most recently Lost Ceilings, a collectio=
n
of prose poems.  A second CD of words and music, in collaboration with the
band Moving Star, is slated for release in early 2005.


BRAINLINGO: WRITING THE VOICE OF THE BODY =AD=AD EDWIN TORRES

Tuesdays at 7pm: 5 sessions begin November 30
As artists we create our own communication, how we listen affects how we
speak, how we see our language affects how our voice is heard. Where the
senses meet each other is where poetry can begin. This workshop will be an
active creative laboratory that will explore how we communicate by
exercising the languages inside us. This is an active writing workshop
requiring a bottomless well and an open mind.

Edwin Torres=B9 books include The All-Union Day Of The Shock Worker, Fracture=
d
Humorous, I Hear Things People Haven=B9t Really Said, and his CDs Holy Kid
(Kill Rock Stars) and Novo (www.oozebap.org). He is co-editor of Rattapalla=
x
and has a show on PS.1=B9s internet-radio station (www.wps1.org) called LIVE
NUDE RADIO THEATER.


WRITING IN THE STEPMOTHER TONGUE =AD=AD OZ SHELACH

Thursdays at 7pm: 10 sessions begin October 14th
Many of us today write in English without being at home. A disability? An
advantage? How and when to adapt, defy, write with an accent, subvert, merg=
e
in, stand out? We'll play games devised by and for non-native writers in
English; Read worldwide fiction; Use supportive criticism. I hope all of us
will come out with deeper confidence in making our writing effective by
drawing on the richness of our difference.

Oz Shelach moved to NY after working as a journalist in Israel (and writing
in Hebrew) for many years. His novel, Picnic Grounds, was published by City
Lights in 2003.

=20
HAVING IT BOTH WAYS: THE PROSE POEM =AD=AD LARRY FAGIN

Fridays at 7pm: 10 sessions begin October 15th
A workshop designed for writers of both poetry and short prose (any genre),
who are interested in investigating the boundary between the two areas, or
those who have discovered such boundaries to be less than trustworthy. We
will read (Baudelaire, Stein, Ponge, Ashbery, Lydia Davis, Killarney Clary,
et al), exchange ideas (story, description, image, abstraction, the
personal), and refine our writing with an eye toward publication. Weekly
reading and writing assignments.

Larry Fagin edits Adventures in Poetry (books) and Sal Mimeo (magazine). He
teaches "experimental poetry" at New School University. Coma Rock, a prose
poem, will appear as a chapbook in Winter 2004.


ROCKS AND IDEAS =AD=AD RACHEL LEVITSKY

Saturdays at 12pm: 10 sessions begin October 16th
William Carlos Williams famously said, "--Say it, no ideas but in things--,=
=B2
a line which can be variously interpreted. In our virtual era, ideas and
things may a) be difficult to distinguish and b) have a tendency to morph
into each other.  Williams himself writes an introduction to his long poem
=B3Paterson,=B2 that explains the idea behind the long work. In this workshop w=
e
will experiment with things while having big fat ideas. We'll look at other
important modern and post modern works like Anne Waldman's Iovis, Harriet
Mullen's S*PeRM**K*T and Will Alexander's Asia and Haiti (and others) to
help us along.=20

Rachel Levitsky=B9s books include Under the Sun (Futurepoem, 2003) and the
chapbooks Cartographies of Error (Leroy, 1999) and Dearly, (a+bend, 1999).
She is the founder and co-curator of the Belladonna* Series in New York
City.

=20
The workshop fee is $300, which includes a one-year individual Poetry
Project membership and tuition for any and all fall and spring classes.
Reservations are required due to limited class space and payment must be
received in advance. Please send payment and reservations to: The Poetry
Project, St. Mark=B9s Church, 131 E. 10th St., NY, NY 10003. For more
information please call (212) 674-0910 or e-mail info@poetryproject.com.

I was really hit hard by the news of Bill's death.  He
was a good friend of mine though I only met him in
person once.  Multi-talented, he was the kind of
artist not funded by NEA, regardless of the
administration--and a vigorous champion of others'
work.

Stephen,

Did you know this is 14 pages printed out?

Thanks for this.  So much for the opinion that Bush's administration and a
new Kerry administration would be "the same"; I wonder what drug people are
on when I hear this.

This is amazing stuff.

If you thought the "I can protect you" rhetoric in Bush's speech last night
was at odds with well and not so well-known recorded facts, the article
(below)in today's Independent (London) provides a pretty devastating account
of this demonstration's performance purely by the numbers.

The Chopsticks

My name is Harry. On a good day, you'll find me at a local watering hole.
I do business left table rear. I know the place. But this time the job was
different. I'd been sent to south Japan to look for a necklace. Not an
ordinary neckless, mind you, but one worn by the Kami of Peru. It's a long
story. I was in Fuokoka or however they spell it and I was being followed.
I was sure of it. I can sense stalking a mile away. He walked like a ghost
and I thought he must talk like one too. Dressed all in black, slipping
from one doorway to another. I read about characters like him. They're
unemployed, always on the lookout, easy hires. I walked into a yatai, one
of those restaurant stalls they have. Not like Tokio. Everyone stared.
There were four customers in the place. I ordered rice and that eel they
put on top, used my hashi like a native. My friend came in and sat at the
other end of the counter. The rest of the place left. Everyone knows when
trouble comes knocking. I took my chopsticks and placed them upright in
the rice. That's the Buddhist sign of death for these folks. Call me Harry
I said. The stranger looked at me then at the sticks. He backed away in
terror and fled. I have to say I never saw him again. The eel was good and
I went on with my mission. Let me tell you, chopsticks come in handy, a
quick fix when nothing else will do.

There was also a good article in the NY Times --
was it yesterday or the day before? on Dana Goia's
stewardship of the NEA. The general thrust of it
was that he's trying to seed a lot of programs to
make the arts more "accessible," and steering away
from the Mapplethorpe-type controversies that
sparked the decline in funding over the course of
the last 10 years. Someone quoted in the article
mentioned "repairing the walls between artists and
audiences," which struck me as a strange metaphor
to use... Also of note: funding for the NEA has
actually INCREASED under the Bush regime.

the fellowships, yes, only go to writers

but the fellowships are by no means the largest
part of NEA funding -- they fund all of the arts
in various ways

see <http://www.nea.gov>

The NEA also dispenses a lot of its money to state
arts councils and commissions, who then fund
activities and organizations within the specific
states.

When I was lucky enough to get one of those NEA fellowships, I
remember there were two "requirements": I couldn't use the money
on any illegal activity (there went the seed money for my bookie
business) and I was supposed to spend the money in the US.  I
was also asked not to use the money to write pornography or to
blow it on the down payment for a ferrari.

The NEA (and I also think the NEH) are in the fairly unique
position of not being part of the Congressional patronage
machine (also known as pork).  Senators and congressmen can't
steer grants to political contributors or constituents
(otherwise the artistic center of America would move from one
house majority leader's district to the next, and we'd be
discussing the  South Houston renaissance on this list).

This independence is as much a liability as a strength, however,
because it makes NEA funding a safe target for attack.  What
makes cutting spending contentious is that everyone in Congress
is connected to everything spent in the budget: military bases,
highways, subsidies, writeoffs  and loopholes -- but since
nobody in Congress has a stake in what the NEA spends it's easy
to cut.

I think that's the main reason the NEA has moved away from
funding individuals and towards funding instituitions
(especially state arts agencies) -- political traction in
Congress.

Perversely enough, if the NEA/NEH weren't so independent, their
budgets would probably be much, much larger.

Donald Allen, 92, Book Editor of Bold New Voices in Poetry, Dies
By WOLFGANG SAXON

Donald Merriam Allen, a poetry editor whose 1960 anthology of the era's
contemporary and avant-garde poets remains a milestone in American
letters, died on Aug. 29 in San Francisco. He was 92.

His death was announced by his friend and executor, Michael Williams.

Mr. Allen started compiling his landmark collection in 1958 as an editor
at Grove Press. In "The New American Poetry: 1945-1960" he presented a
new generation. It offered a sampler of 44 young voices arranged in five
overlapping groupings, and was one of the first countercultural
collections of American verse. The difference between the older
traditional voices and the new was described by Robert Lowell as the
difference between the "cooked" and the "raw."

There were the Black Mountain poets like Charles Olson, Robert Duncan
and Robert Creeley; the San Francisco renaissance voices of James
Broughton, Madeline Gleason and Lawrence Ferlinghetti; the beat
generation of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and Gregory Corso; the New
York poets like John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch and Frank O'Hara; and a fifth
group of younger names without geographical definition, including Philip
Whalen and Stuart Z. Perkoff.

Mr. Allen's handiwork caused a literary stir and upset the poetry
establishment in particular. It spotlighted some large new talents
culled from small magazines and lent a degree of respectability even to
fringe lyricists from San Francisco and its environs.

What united them, Harvey Shapiro noted in his review in The New York
Times in 1960, was their disdain for traditional great English and
American poetry and poets. More disapprovingly, the critic John Simon
wrote, "Mr. Allen's anthology divides all gall into five parts."

But the work endured and was reissued most recently by the University of
California Press, where it remains in print. In 1975 Mr. Allen edited,
with Warren Tallman, an updated companion volume to the 1960 anthology,
"The Poetics of the New American Poetry" (Grove).

Donald Allen was born in Muscatine, Iowa, the son of a doctor. He
graduated in 1934 from the University of Iowa, from which he also
received an M.A. in English literature a year later. After postgraduate
studies at the University of California at Berkeley, he moved to New
York. He was an editor at Grove from 1950 to 1970, both in New York and
later on the West Coast, where he was co-editor of Grove's Evergreen
Review, which published Ginsberg's "Howl."

He translated four plays by Eugene Ionesco (Grove, 1958), and his
versions of "The Bald Soprano" and "The Lesson" continue to be staged.
He edited selections of writings by O'Hara, Olson, Kerouac, Mr. Creeley,
Edward Dorn, Jack Spicer and others.

To promote his favorite writers he founded and managed two literary
presses, Grey Fox and Four Seasons Foundation, which published the new
poetry along with books on philosophy and Buddhism and gay and lesbian
literature.

Mr. Allen is survived by a sister, Kathryn Payne of Charlottesville, Va.

I was also struck by the Times' discussion of how
Gioia's strategy has been less to fund artists and

"accessibility," I also think that if we want $$$ to
support the arts (and scholars, via the NEH), then the
more local power, the better.  Taking the defense of
Mapplethorpe to Capital Hill, while I wholeheartedly
agree with it, unfortunately becomes one of those
gestures that is right without being efficacious.

I wouldn't give Dana Gioia credit for this, at least not entirely. The
decision to de-fund fellowships except to literary artists took place well
before his tenure at the NEA, and was indeed a reaction to controversies
over Mapplethorpe, Serrano, Finley, and others. And while it was possible
to de-fund fellowships in the visual arts yet still keep funding visual
arts major institutions, in literature the fellowships were by far the
major part of the funding, as the literary field didn't have major arts
institutions (the best-funded literary presses can't compare in any way, in
their budget sizes, even to smaller urban art museums). Plus there didn't
seem to be any of the same kind of outcry over controversies regarding the
works of creative writers that were funded, or at least I didn't hear any.

Also, even before Gioia and before the de-funding of individual
fellowships, it seems to me that more funds already went to "programs"
rather than to "artists," although certainly a significant portion of such
"program" money goes to artists.

What I don't know is whether the funding from the NEA that goes to state
arts agencies contains any restrictions about individual fellowships, thus
whether, in fact, the NEA may still be funding individual fellowships, but
through state arts agencies. I also don't know whether the state agencies'
selections of grant recipients (individuals and otherwise) can be
considered any more conservative than NEA selections of such recipients.

It's in fact a bad sign when funding increases for the NEA with the
right-wing administration, as it's a sign that the organization is towing
the party line.

with all due respect, is it possible this might be
oversimplifying it a little bit? I'm not doubting
the essential veracity of what you're saying --
and was not trying to make a point one way or the
other in my post -- in fact, the only point being
made in the NY Times was "look what a good job
Gioia's doing."

on the one hand, it speaks to the level of
distrust that exists for this particular regime...
I mean, if I read today that bush decided to
outlaw SUVs, sign the semi-auto weapons ban, and
pull us out of Iraq, I'd wonder what the catch
was. But as the administrator for a tiny arts
nonprofit which has received NEA funding in the
past, although I doubt very much we'll see any in
the future, I can't call this an out-and-out "bad
sign" without qualifying that and adding that I'm
happy for whatever orgs. and artists do get
funded. I'm certain they're not all "toeing the
party line."

Also: doesn't it tell us how completely and
thoroughly the conservatives have stolen the
initiative on just about every issue? Dems are
scared to death of fighting for arts funding and
being labeled Mapplethorpe-loving,
crucifix-piss-drinking liberals, so it's left to
the repubs to deign to throw the arts a few scraps
and take credit for it. The same thing's happening
here in California, where the CAC has essentially
been gutted down to nothing and the few souls who
still care are left to grovel before Ahnold to get
any funding at all.

A concious reference to Laura Elizabeth Richards'
"Eletelephony"?

Once there was an elephant,
Who tried to use the telephant--
No! No! I mean an elephone
Who tried to use the telephone--
(Dear me! I am not certain quite
That even now I've got it right).

Howe'er it was, he got his trunk
Entangled in the telephunk;
The more he tried to get it free,
The louder buzzed the telephee--
(I fear I'd better drop the song
Of elephop and telephong!)

David:

It is true that, as you say, anything the Bush Administration warrants my
suspicion. After all, these are the people who gave us such programs in
which "Healthy Forests" means cutting more trees, or "Clear Skies" means
more air pollution. It goes on.
With the NEA, the big program to which Bush gave money was for performances
of Shakespeare's plays. I find this as ingenuous as everything else he does.
As for the Democrats, they give liberalism a bad name.

This is really great news, so good I can hardly believe it.  I've been =
researching Douglass's time in Ireland for a couple of years.  I have the =
good fortune of living close to Boston and Boston Public Library which had =
a terrific collection of Douglass material in its Anti-Slavery Collection. =
 However, I cannot go there regularly as I want and need to.  But I think =
7,400 online items will keep me happy for quite a while!

The Library of Congress is pleased to announce the final release of the
Frederick Douglass Papers at the Library of Congress, available on
the American Memory Web site at http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/doughtml/

The Frederick Douglass Papers at the Library of Congress presents the
papers of the nineteenth-century African-American abolitionist who
escaped from slavery and then risked his own freedom by becoming an
outspoken antislavery lecturer, writer, and publisher.

The online collection, from the Library of Congress' Manuscript
Division, now contains approximately 7,400 items (38,000 images)
relating to Douglass' life as an escaped slave, abolitionist, editor,
orator, and public servant. The papers span the years 1841 to 1964, with
the bulk of the material from 1862 to 1895. The collection consists of
correspondence, speeches and articles by Douglass and his
contemporaries, a draft of his autobiography, financial and legal
papers, scrapbooks, and miscellaneous items. These papers reveal
Douglass' interest in diverse subjects such as politics, emancipation,
racial prejudice, women's suffrage, and prison reform. Included is
correspondence with many prominent civil rights reformers of his day,
including Susan B. Anthony, William Lloyd Garrison, Gerrit Smith, Horace
Greeley, and Russell Lant, and political leaders such as Grover
Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison. Scrapbooks document Douglass' role as
minister to Haiti and the controversy surrounding his interracial second
marriage.  The online release of the Frederick Douglass Papers is made
possible through the generous support of the Citigroup Foundation.

American Memory is a gateway to rich primary source materials relating
to the history and culture of the United States. The site offers more
than 8 million digital items from more than 120 historical collections.

I am very excited to announce that The Analogous Series starts this weekend!

September 11, 5 PM 77 Massachusetts Ave, room 2-105, Cambridge, MA

* * *

Gary Sullivan and Brandon Downing

Gary and Brandon will read poems and present a collaborative, 6-page comic.

For more information and a sample of their work, take a look at the new
Analogous Series website here: http://www.analogous.net/SullivanDowning.html

Gary Sullivan's comic, "The New Life," has been serialized in Rain Taxi
since 1997. He has collaborated on comics with numerous poets including Drew
Gardner, Juliana Spahr, and Brian Kim Stefans, and created artwork for books
by Nada Gordon, Susan Landers, Jack Kimball, and many others. With Jena
Osman, Juliana Spahr and Janet Zweig, he co-edited a special issue of Chain
devoted to comics (issue #8). His own books include How to Proceed in the
Arts (2001, Faux Press) and, with Nada Gordon, Swoon (2001, Granary Books).

Brandon Downing is a writer and visual artist based in New York City. His
books include LAZIO (Blue Books, 2000) and THE SHIRT WEAPON (Germ
Monographs, 2002). His second collection of poetry, DARK BRANDON, is
forthcoming in 2005.

* * *

Directions from the T or on foot: take the Red Line to Central Square and
walk down Mass Ave toward MIT. 77 Massachusetts Avenue should be on your
right. Go down the hall for several corridors and take a right -- look for
room 2-105. Everything's numbered so it's fairly easy to navigate.

Directions by car or from anywhere else: mapquest is your friend. Or
alternately, feel free to email me & ask.

* * *

The event will be followed by a potluck over at my apartment in Somerville,
MA. Everyone's invited, though it's BYOB.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best,

Tim

From the Washington Post

"...The situation with the CIA and ghost soldiers is beginning to look like
a bad movie," said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield declined to comment on the number of cases. He
noted the agency's inspector general is reviewing the CIA's involvement in
detention and interrogations in Iraq. "We take these matters very seriously
and are determined to examine thoroughly any allegations of abuse," he said.

The generals and the authors of a separate report on prison abuses discussed
their investigations in a series of hearings Thursday by the Senate and
House Armed Services committees.

Fay said the Army made several requests to the CIA station chief in Iraq for
information about the detainees.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said in recent months that it
suspects the United States is hiding detainees in lockups across the globe.
Terror suspects reported by the FBI as captured have never turned up in
detention centers, and the United States has failed to reply to agency
demands for a list of everyone it's holding, the agency said.

Under the Geneva Conventions, the United States is obliged to give the
neutral, Swiss-run humanitarian agency access to prisoners of war and other
detainees to check on their conditions and allow them to send messages to
their families."

Can some kind of collective rage set Kerry totally on fire - that is,
campaign?  Jeezus.
George, Cheney and Rumsfeld  - 'this', 'these', whatever 'they' are  could,
or very well "are" leading us "all' - I mean that globally - to a very bad
end. I'm getting bad, very bad German dreams!

If these guys are not voted out - not to sound outrageously in despair -
this election depression is beginning to feel like collective, self-induced
euthanasia.

Have we, the electorate, also getting ghosted? The ghost election of 2004?


At least time for another and another demonstration.

Buffalo list lurkers have already heard of the crimes against humanity
occurring right now in the Darfur region of Sudan. This is the content
of a letter from Christian Children's Fund I recently received. Even
a minor contribution would help so I've included the address and info.

Major news media resources are only sporadically reporting on
this tragedy.

Political and religious affiliations aside, something needs to be happen
now to help these people in dire need. I've done so.

Thank you. LS

------------------------------------------

SUDANESE CRISIS REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION

You've probably heard that the violence in the Darfur region of Sudan
in East Africa has now escalated. About 1.4 million Sudanese citizens--
mostly women and children--have been forced to flee for their lives.
Many
are in refugee camps in the sweltering desert of the neighboring country
of Chad.

I'm writing to you today with the most disturbing news about this tragic
situation the UN is now calling the "world's greatest humanitarian
crisis."

Armed militias have now increased their brutal attacks on villagers,
and it is
estimated they have already murdered more than 30,00 people. Mukesh
Kapila, former UN humanitarian coordinator for Sudan, recently stated:

"I was present in Rwanda at the time of the genocide, and I've seen
many other situations around the world and I am totally shocked at
what is going on in Darfur. This is ethnic cleansing, this is the
world's
greatest humanitarian crisis, and I don't know why the world is not
doing something about it."

As the violence continues, innocent people are being terrorized. Forced
to leave their communities, they are now seeking refuge across the
border
in Chad. Christian Children's Fund has sent a special emergency team to
Chad to assist the refugees escaping the ethnic violence in Sudan.

Among the displaced are more than 180,00 refugees living in camps in
Chad, mostly women and children because the men have been murdered,
with another 60,000 now trying to survive along the border.

The situation is beyond critical. Thousands and thousands of these
families
have lost everything...many of the children are starving...and many of
them
are now sick.

Equally distressing is the plight of a large number of the refugee women
and girls, who have been sexually assaulted. One young 15-year-old
girl named Amna described what has now become disturbingly common-
place in her area:

"They came and took all our property from our village and they burnt it
and the other villages nearby. The children were taken away
and then the girls were raped..."

CCF's response teams include specialists in psychosocial, child
protection,
and other emergency programs. They are now considering many strategies
for
an immediate and integrated response. The CCF team will assess the
conditions
and plan the implementation of urgently needed programs to address

--Child protection for the children through CCF's child-centered spaces
--The psychosocial needs of the women and young girls who have been
sexually assaulted

Your compassion will help these people in dire need. The money will be
used to ease the suffering of children and families who have fled to
Chad,
and those who are desperately trying to survive this life-threatening
emergency.

TO MAKE A DONATION IMMEDIATELY, please call 1-800-776-6767

or send a check made out to  "Christian Children's Fund/Child Alert
Emergency Fund"
of any amount to the below address

Yes, what IS that all about, obituary writer Wolgang
Saxon's swerve towards a smirk at unspecified SF
"fringe lyricists"?

The obituary is otherwise fairly respectful and
competent, but one thing that leaped out at me was the
phrase concerning the New Americans' "disdain for
traditional great English and American poetry and
poets".  The reader is left with the impression that
these poets tended towards indifference or hostility
towards figures like Chaucer, Shakespeare, Wordsworth
and Dickinson as much as towards figures like Tennyson
or Longfellow.

Mr. Saxon says this "disdain" is spoken of by Harvey
Shapiro in his 1960 review of the Allen anthology.
This afternoon I found the Shapiro review, which was
published in the August 28, 1960 Times Sunday Book
Review under the title "Rebellious Mythmakers".  What
H. Shapiro says about disdain is this: "They disdain
our major poets: 'Who are the great poets of our time,
and what are their names?/Yeats of the baleful
influence, Auden of the baleful influence/Eliot of the
baleful influence.' They condemn the careers young
poets choose today: 'Where are young poets in America,
they are trembling in publishing houses and
universities,/Above all they are trembling in
universities, they are bathing the library steps with
their spit,' They are bored by the predictable
products of these academic young--poems 'written by
the men with their eyes on the myth/And the Missus and
the mid-terms in the Hudson Review.' Pentameter, they
feel, still inhibits American verse: 'farewell stale
pale skunky pentameter (the only honest Enlgish meter,
gloop, gloop!).'  (All these quotes courtesy of
Kenneth Koch, cutup of the New York branch of New
Poetry.)
  As Mr. Koch's farewell to pentameter indicates, much
of the new verse is a continuation of the crusade
against the English tradition begun years ago by Pound
and Williams."


So, what reviewer Shapiro is discussing is the desire
of the New American Poets to do something very
different from 20th century figures like Yeats, Auden,
and Eliot.  AND the fact that the N.A.P.'s  want to
break away from pentameter and other aspects of the
English tradition in their own practice.

It wasn't, of course, a desire to throw Chaucer and
Shakespeare and all the Anglos and Saxons into the
dustbin. But how was Saxon, generalist obituary
writer, to know that?

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
=20
Important Multi-Cultural Festival To Be Held In Queens September 18, =
2004
=20
FLUSHING, NY August, 2004- The Second Queens International Poetry =
Festival
will be held on Saturday, September 18, 2004 at the Flushing Library
Auditorium in Flushing, Queens 41-17 Main Street from 12 noon to 4pm. =
Both
world renowned and younger poets will perform their poetry in both =
English
and at least seven other languages. The program will also feature a =
musical
performance by the New Culture Ensemble. As well, Sridhar Shanmugam will
perform classical Indian dance. Iranian-American scholar and translator,
Iraj Anvar will sing the poetry of Rumi in the original Persian.
=20
Last year=92s festival attracted poets and audience members from many
different cultural communities. The organizers, Movement One: Creative
Coalition, view the festival as a celebration of the diversity and =
talent
the New York area, especially Queens, enjoys. Though the event is not a
memorial of the tragic events begun on September 11, 2001, it is an
assertion of the communication and inter-cultural work necessary to =
assure
that mass destruction will cease.
=20
Before immigrating to the U.S., several participating poets suffered
persecution and imprisonment in their countries of origins. =
Participating
poets include Man Mohan Alam, Fuad Attal (Arabic) , Milly Brig =
(Spanish),
N.M. Danish (Urdu) , Jyoti Datta (Bengali) , Peggy Garrison, Daniela
Gioseffi, Harlym 125, Sang Hee Kwak (Korean) , Pwu Jean Lee, Johar Mir
(Urdu), Dr. Shehla Naqvi (Urdu), Richard Newman, Onome, Randhir Singh,
Tarlok Singh (Punjabi) , Ella Smith, Ricardo Leon Pena Villa (Spanish) =
and
Huang Xiang (Chinese).
=20
The festival is co-sponsored by The Queens Council on Arts, Terraza =
Caf=E9 and
WenXinShe Literary Organization. The program is free and open to the =
public.

I have received a lot of elegaic writing and it appears I have enough =
for Big Bridge. Thanks to everyone for sending work. If there are some =
writers who have been preparing work and can get something to me in the =
next couple of hours I will look at it, otherwise I will have to make =
the entire issue an Elegy issue. I wonder now why there is such an =
abundance of elegaic writing. Is it something about the times?=20

Thanks again,
Michael

I heard =93Ellen Bryant Voigt=94 =93read=94
her poetry, she
             ah she
pronouncingly repeated
the 20 yr old idiot Yeats=92 pronouncement
that poetry=92s about passion, strange
she should be so prim her poetry
limp, the melodrama therein
sounded
like distant cats fucking.
Very distant.
Nameless Creek 203 m (these
distances now inaccurate b/c
of detour in Lilly Indy)

Anthony Creek. There
are the Goofy Hoosiers in
the distant sunlit field
mit shorts on, Stadium Empty,
huddling at some game
Montgomery Creek.
Here Are Hoosiers in tractors,
men & women west
of Big Blue River cutting
booby-thick median grass
and the grasses of the ditches
That odd butterfly
             seemed so happy
the light in the east lighting her

Optimistic little things
though I know sometimes melancholy
Generally a butterfly is
childlishly guileless, a wisp on a hinge
only slightly tougher than the wind
itself
Whitewater River there are no
large bugsplats yet
Move by me, blossoming dill!

A few kicked me, though not

They did not poop

they merely let me swing

I am then, in Ohio, A turtle yacht

When I stop in them gas station
             And see
the ignorant peoples
I wonder
Why they ignorant
Why they so dumb
             ?
It=92s because I think
their dumb teachers are dumb
Where they should have had passion
             and Love
they had fear and pride
How they can be so proud
             and so simultaneous dumb
IS THIS CAR NOT MY

10:44pm Eastern time I burst
through A castle of paper
that has appeared on the

ONWARD ROSANANTE!
Confetti blizzards behind me
Or was that a nunnery of paper?
Have I burst many nuns?
There is a slightly naughty
quality of fire to break lights
The Amber kindles gripped
by the asses of cars
As if each trailed 2 bundles
             of burning broom straw

But we do not speak of it on

yachts, our turtles, our steeds

                         My windshield missed
a moth. I have often wondered
if the slapping swirl of air from A
passing car will cripple a
Moth or hobble
             A butterfly.

Fine grain of mist past 10 miles
    wipers can=92t quite take it off
they smear it into a thin condiment
     made of bug meat and cloud water

It clings there w/ an almost static charge
   to the clear silicate toast of
      my windscreen

Now A crackling rain 8 miles
     West of CLARION   1245am ESt
Shippenville  2 miles
The rises drops & turns of this
     stretch cause the dinosaur sized
Median trees to drop rise &
    sway, their leaves strain
and sift the lights of the
oncoming traffic, which are not
yellow. Or beige nor tan. But a
kind of off white, A sallow white,
    though some of the newer cars are
             blue

And in this weeping night
their reflections glister like
the prism blobs & corpuscles of light
one sees on the eyelashes
in a rain or if one has cried
and tried to see. Punxsatauwney,
North Fork Creek
There is a mist whose rate of
deposit on the windscreen falls
slightly below the first indexed
wiping speed, which causes a slight
annoyance in the driving

Dear List,

A friend is organizing a film series on the theme of father-daughter
relationships.  He would like to use an anthology of poetry related to that
theme -- if there is one.

He has asked me to help, and now I turn to you....

Can anyone recommend something?

Thanks in advance,

George Thompson

Galway Kinnell has a poem for his daughter.

More seriously, Jason Schinder has an anthology, More Light: Father &

While it is out of print, Amazon has 13 used.  Or you might contact him
or something.  He did used to consult to Sundance after all.

Dear All,

Trilingual Three Factorial is bursting at the seams with translations
of poetry from Japanese to English, Japanese to French, French to
Japanese, French to English, Japanese to French to English, plus some
Visual Japanese poetry, Japanese Sound Poetry. . . in other words it's
exciting, authentic, contemporary, and . . .mostly Japanese. Available
very very
soon! Also of note: the new Aufgabe features contemporary Japanese
poetry in translation as well.

Equally exciting is this new call for work for the next issue: the
Four Factorial Speed Round! All submitting and editing will take place
within the next 1.5 months - submissions will be accepted from now
through the end of October, and will be read and edited by guest
editors chosen semi-randomly as I travel around the states - in
Boston, Amherst, NYC, Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison, Kalamazoo, NYC, and
San Francisco. (http://www.factorial.org/sn/read.html) As soon as I
have 10 submissions I will give the package to a guest editor, who
will choose selections to go into the Second Round. I will continue
this as I travel throughout the month, choosing a new editor for every
10 submissions. As soon as there are 10 submissions that make it past
the First Round, they will be passed on to a Second Round Guest
Editor, and so it goes.

*Collaborative writing and works in translation will automatically be
entered into the Second Round.
OR
*Buy your way into the Second Round by enclosing a Factorial
proof-of-purchase: a jpeg photo of you with a copy of any of the three
issues of Factorial.

***For detailed instructions, please visit the Factorial website:
http://www.factorial.org/ ***

What happens:
Individual replies will only be sent to those whose work will be
published in Four Factorial. All current standings will be posted
online at http://www.factorialpress.blogspot.com/ as they are made
available. The finalists will be published in Four Factorial in 2005 -
possibly, maybe, perhaps - with Japanese translation!

$135, $110 for members

Is that story for kids you long to write cowering inside your head? Is it
gasping for air beneath the clutter in your desk? Then it's time to come out
of the drawer. Learn to capture your readers with an intriguing "Hook;"
build Believable Characters; use a single Point Of View, Identify a
Conflict, Show Rather Than Tell and Market your work to an editor.

the Institute of Children's Literature has published books for everyone from

Time to brush off that manuscript somewhere buried, take the plunge, and

can be yours, but first you must write the story. For both veterans and
novices, this seminar will present the critical foundations necessary to
assist you in writing a novel. Topics include: developing plots, building
character, generating scenes and, finally, how to make it all make sense.

Linda Lavid is author of Rented Rooms. Here work has appeared in The

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and
taverns!),mutilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented
forms. We will explore the structural possibilities of language to
ultimately answer the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning
and practiced poets will generate lots of original writing from this full
day of language play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye
with which to revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson Literary
Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the Arts, Mad
Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled notspeak.

KGB Bar, 85 East 4th St (betw. 2nd & 3rd Aves.), NYC
Landis Everson, Glyn Maxwell, Katia Kapovich, Ben Mazer, Philip

Landis Everson was an inner member of the Berkeley Renaissance of the
late 1940s, the fourth intimate of the famed Spicer-Duncan-Blaser
circle. To Jack Spicer he was a myth and a god. To Robert Duncan he was
the Poet King. John Ashbery admired his poetry in New York in the early
1950s, and published selections in Locus Solus in 1962 (Everson's last
appearance in print until now!). In 1960 Everson participated in a
pivotal three-person weekly Sunday poetry group with Spicer and Blaser
in San Francisco. While Spicer was writing Homage to Creeley, Everson
was composing Postcard from Eden and The Little Ghosts I Played With,
two great sequences which now appear in print for the first time in
Fulcrum 3, in The Berkeley Renaissance, edited by Ben Mazer. Fulcrum is
proud to present Landis Everson's first public appearances in over forty
years.

John Hennessy's poems have recently appeared or are forthcoming in
Fulcrum, The Sewanee Review, Salt, The Yale Review, LIT, and Ontario
Review. He teaches at UMass Amherst.

Katia Kapovich's collection of English language poetry is Gogol in Rome
(Salt, 2004). She is also a well-known Russian poet.

Mark Lamoureux's chapbooks are CITY/TEMPLE (Ugly Ducking Presse, 2003)
and 29 CHEESEBURGERS (Pressed Wafer, 2004).

Glyn Maxwell, born in Hertfordshire, England, now lives in NY City. His
several books of poetry include The Breakage and The Nerve (both
Houghton Mifflin). He is the poetry editor of The New Republic and
teaches at Princeton and Columbia.

Ben Mazer's chapbook selection of poetry, with cover art by Mary
Fabilli, is forthcoming from Fulcrum this fall. He is the editor of The
Berkeley Renaissance (Fulcrum, 2004) and The Collected Poems of John
Crowe Ransom (Handsel, 2005).

Philip Nikolayev's latest book of poetry is Monkey Time, 2001 Verse
Prize winner. His new collection is forthcoming from Salt.

Subject:      Defining "Precision" in Iraq
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"
Content-transfer-encoding: quoted-printable

This from the Tuesday Guardian (London):

Ambulance torn apart in Fallujah as US launches 'precision' strikes

From Patrick Cockburn in Baghdad

14 September 2004

A plume of grey smoke billowed above Fallujah yesterday as the US military
claimed they were making precision air strikes against insurgents in the
city and local doctors said that civilians were being killed and wounded.

The US army said its warplanes had bombed houses because it had intelligenc=
e
about the presence of fighters loyal to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whom the US
sees as the guiding hand behind many attacks on its forces.

Dr Adel Khamis of the Fallujah General Hospital said at least 16 people wer=
e
killed, including women and children, and 12 others were wounded. Video fil=
m
showed a Red Crescent ambulance torn apart by an explosion. A hospital
official said the driver, a paramedic and five patients had been killed by
the blast.

"The conditions here are miserable - an ambulance was bombed, three houses
destroyed and men and women killed," said Rafayi Hayad al-Esawi, the
director of the hospital. "The American army has no morals."

The US air force has claimed repeatedly since the invasion of Iraq in March
last year to be hitting hostile targets identified by US intelligence.
During the war it made 50 air strikes to kill senior members of Saddam
Hussein's regime some of which caused many civilian casualties. Only after
the war did US Defence officials admit that all the air strikes had missed
their target. On Sunday US helicopters fired rockets into a crowd in Haifa
Street in central Baghdad killing 13 people including an Al-Arabiya
television correspondent killed as he was reporting.

The escalating violence in Iraq is putting in doubt the feasibility of
holding elections in January. The interim government has complete control o=
f
only a few cities such as Najaf where the opposition has been routed by the
US army using its massive firepower. "Iraq is becoming fragmented like
Lebanon with each community having some power," said Ghasan Attiyah, an
Iraqi commentator.

The US is now trying to reassert the authority of the interim government by
bombing and the use of its air power but this is making the 138,000-strong
US army in Iraq more unpopular by the day. High civilian casualties also
create a backlash and act as a recruiting sergeant for insurgents.

Ironically one of the quietest cities in Iraq is Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's
home town, where the US army agreed with local tribal leaders not to fire
back with its artillery if it was mortared.

"THE ANATOMY OF NOSTALGIA"
by James Brasfield

The gray light that is dusk, the mist
that gathers at the end of August,
the sudden drop of warmth in the coming dark,
the stillness of an arclight over the dim road,
and farther still, lamplight at a window,

the curtains drawn--there, a woman
puts a small supper at the table, pours
flavored water from a crystal carafe,
an heirloom like a root toward the river.
The stewed apple slices have darkened from days
of floating in the green jar.

And the man pours himself a vodka,
the first of many, and cuts the bread.
Tomorrow remains so far off.
Its burdens are as yesterday's.

I know these things
from sitting at the table,
from walking the road.  I know them
from a train passing through a town at night,
the wet streets, the dim station,
the streets again and another house

outside of town, the darkness everywhere
filling in the impossible space
a light is assigned, yet always a road
at dusk, the mist, the arclight
a hundred yards before the next,

and the road to a path through the forest,
a light at a window as if only
a light burned among the trees--
a candle on the chest of a corpse, at nightfall.


from _In This Paradise_
by Joseph Donahue

XXVIII


Are you the one whose
error has required you to be

a billow of moths, a sprig of gold
in the garden of a witch

a cut  finger at the banquet,
the jewel forming from the blood

or the eel who says to the astonished boy
"I feel myself pierced and dispersed."

Any minute, you could be
the stag leading the lost soul,

or a spatter along a rail crying
out to your sister: "here I am."

Any minute you could be a lost spoon
or bones murmuring in the flowers:

"Some of us are in disguise,
& some of us have been eaten.

Some of us are touched by beauty
& cannot control our thoughts . . ."

Or ice glittering in the trees.
Or a gold leaf. Or a king walking

At evening through a blue orchard.
A moment ago, you were an old woman

with a fever, the ground opening at your feet,
hidden corridors aglow with torches.

Just now, you're a child hiding
in a house of murderers . . .

And do you glory in what you may yet be,
a hungry crow, a wisp of silk,

a cloud less than breath in a chill,
a village caked in volcanic ash?

Are you the whitening sky?
Are you robins at rest in a tree?

(They could be the wounds of Christ.)
Are your consonants a ring of clouds?

Are your vowels the dark hollows
where you look for  your twin?

Are you the one locked inside
the tower of an evil will?

Are you the drunk suitor with
a blank map, set adrift in a boat?

Are you the true bride,
weeping in your collar of nettles?

If you break a branch, fall asleep in a tree,
will you be a snake until a beggar

cups water to your lips?
If you burn a gossamer veil,

or stain a peach-colored shawl,
or scatter the ashes in the ravine,

will you be a seed in a wind
flying across a desert?

Hi All,

Those of you who live in, or will be visiting New York City this Friday, ma=
y
want to attend this important book launch party at the Ukrainian Institute
(corner of 79th St. & Fifth Avenue) at 7 pm. The book, "The Natashas" by
Victor Malarek, includes an indictment of the Bush administration for its
foot- dragging on the issue of international sex slavery and trafficking. M=
y
friend Roksolana Luchkan is organizing this event, and asked me to forward
this press release.

Thanks, and I hope some of you can attend.

Marc Nasdor

From the press release:
-----------------------
On September 17th, 2004 at 7pm The Ukrainian Institute of America along wit=
h
CAT-USA (Coalition Against Trafficking-USA), Amnesty International Firefly
Project, PLAST Kurin Spartanky, Ukrainian National Women's Leauge of
America, National Council of Women/USA and World Federation of Ukrainian
Women's Organizations is hosting a book launch for a very important book on
human trafficking titled "The Natashas" by Canadian author and journalist
Victor Malarek. =20

In his book Mr. Malarek describes chilling accounts of young women,
sometimes only children being kidnapped or tricked into sexual trafficking.
The book includes interviews with some of the victims of this widespread
crime. Malarek talks about the United States's lack of a firm commitment on
trafficking and their withdrawal from the Rome Statute which created the
International Criminal Court in the Hague focused on prosecuting
international crimes against humanity.

Malarek writes: "The Bush administration and the State Department appear
content to dance a diplomatic tango with a host of nations that clearly hav=
e
despicable records in dealing with trafficking of women and girls. On this
issue, one thing must remain clear: there is no dance for rape."

From a review of the book by the UK's Guardian newspaper: =AFMalarek's
booktakes us to auctions in Bosnia, where women are displayed naked on
wooden crates to be poked and prodded like livestock. He hears stories of
rape, abuse and torture on a shocking scale."

The September 17th event will be the official US book launch and will behel=
d
at the Ukrainian Institute of America located on the corner of 79th Street
and 5th Avenue in New York City. For further information about the event
please contact The Ukrainian Institute at 212.288.8660.

--------------------
Born in Lachine, Quebec, in 1948, Malarek was taken into care in a
children's home when he was nine due to an unstable family life which
involved regularly witnessing his alcoholic father beat his mother in fits
of drunken rage. As a teenager, he spent time in juvenile correction center=
s
for petty crimes, but then decided to turn his life around and got a job as
a copy boyon a Montreal magazine. From there Malarek went on to publish a
best selling book "Hey Malarek" in Canada and on to his career as an
investigative journalist for Toronto's Globe and Mail and CTV Television.

If you cannot attend this important event CAT-USA is taking donations to
continue raising awareness in the US about the horrible crime of sexual
trafficking. Coalition Against Trafficking (CAT-USA) is a New York-based
non-profit volunteer organization committed to raising awareness about the
sex trafficking of women and children from Ukraine, Central & Eastern
Europe. Donations are tax deductible. To donate please call Roksolana
Luchkan, Director of CAT-USA at 917-742-6980 or email CAT-USA at

I've been wondering lately whether anyone's keeping score as to how
we (the US) are doing in terms of inflicting civilian casualties: i.e., who's
ahead now Saddam or us? I suppose civilian casualties inflicted by
the various insurgencies must be included on our side of the ledger,
don't you?

11: public forms
Editors' Note

As long as art is the beauty parlor of civilization, neither art nor
civilization is secure.
 John Dewey, Art as Experience

The creation of art in public places requires the eye of a poet, the ear
of a journalist, and the hide of an armadillo. By intention or
consequence, this work illuminates the relationship between the
institutions that shape and define American life and the people they serve.
 Richard Posner,  Intervention and Alchemy: A Public Art Primer

Nobody knows who the public is or what it wants or needs.
 David Antin

For the eleventh issue of Chain, we put out a call for work that
addresses  public forms.  When we came up with the topic, we were
thinking about what is commonly called  public art  (visual artworks
that are publicly displayed and frequently supported by public funds),
but also about various forms of art that happen outside of usual
performance and publication contexts such as street art, political
speeches, poster campaigns, architectural design, mail art, community
theater, speaker s corners, poetry written for specific public
occasions, etc. In other words, we wanted an issue that would
investigate art that is created by/for communities or  the public  in
its broader definitions.

We received an amazing array of materials that ask us to re-evaluate the
ambient substance of our lives the forms and forums that surround us
everyday. These for(u)ms include letters to the editor, web sites,
eulogies, nodding hello, speech-making, occasional poems, anti-war
signs, line marking on public streets, market research surveys, murals,
text on truckbeds, protest marches, car alarms, surveillance cameras,
aerial views, classified ads, t-shirts, graffiti and graffiti-proofing,
internet spam, stickers in phone booths, prophecies, billboards,
eye-witness reports, architecture, internet discussion groups, call
boxes, banisters, shadows, cemeteries, and train station flip
signs.These everyday forms were accompanied by seemingly simple actions
which have extraordinary cultural resonance, such as planting subversive
signs in corporate sign groves, planting papaya seeds on  public  land
in Hawai i, creating a giant footprint on a beach, or building a private
office for a public telephone. And then there are the less simple
actions, such as staging a city-wide play that enacts the dreams of the
people of Lille, France; critiquing the politics behind the Capital of
Culture competition in Europe; analyzing the debate over the World Trace
Center memorial; or comparing the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas in
Afghanistan to the toppling of the Saddam Hussein sculpture in Firdos
Square.

The pieces here reference sites all over the world, from the
Prostitution Toleration Zone in Rotterdam, to the gutters of Valparaiso,
to the Garden of Eden. But we have also included a number of  reports
from the field  a kind of survey of the local public art that some of
our readers find themselves admiring/rejecting/questioning. These
reports cover the  Dance Steps on Broadway  in Seattle, a bench in Don
Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, an Argentinean small
press that makes books out of cardboard collected by the unemployed,
signs on overpasses that cross I-495 in New England, the  It s a Small
World  ride in Walt Disney World, the movement of elk in Rocky Mountain
National Park, the  empty  buildings of Detroit, a  surfer dude
sculpture in Santa Cruz, and a mechanical beet collector in Loveland,
Colorado.

Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Hi all,

The last call to add a few non-NY small presses to our d.a. levy lives
series yielded three great ones--Palm Press (Los Angeles), a+bend press
(Davis, Calif.), and Pavement Saw Press (Columbus, Ohio). I'm still looking
to add at least two and perhaps as many as four presses.

Below is my post from a few weeks ago, which tells you a bit about the
series. You can email me to editor@boogcity.com if you are interested in
having your press take part or know of a press you think I should pursue.

as ever,
david

Hi all,

The first year of our non-NY Small Press series--d.a. levy lives:
celebrating the renegade press--has gone real well. We were honored to
present readings from:

Meritage Press (San Francisco/St. Helena, Calif.),
The Owl Press (Woodacre, Calif.)
Avec Books (Penngrove, Calif.)
CyPress (Cincinnati, Ohio)
above/ground press (Ottawa, Canada)
Chax Press (Tucson, Arizona)
Carve (Boston)
Braincase Press (Northampton, Mass.)
Combo (Providence, Rhode Island)
Talon Books (Vancouver, British Columbia)

The readings are on the first Thursday of each month at ACA Galleries at 529
W.20th St., 5th Flr. (bet. 10th and 11th avenues) at 6:00 p.m., and usually
feature contributors from a press reading for 20-30 minutes and a musical
act performing for 15-20 minutes, a break, and then 20-30 minutes more of
readings and 15-20 minutes more of music.

The gallery operators are amazing folk and connected to the poetry community
in that they're the son-in-law and daughter of the poet Simon Perchik. They
provide wine and other beverages, cheese, and fruit for each reading, too.
Oh yeah, no door either.

I'm booking our second season now. The rest of 2004 we'll have events from
Conundrum (Chicago), Ambit (Baltimore), a 30th anniversary celebration for
Kelsey Street Press (Berkeley, Calif.), and The Poker (Boston).

We still need some presses for the period of Feb.-May 2005. If you are
interested, please  backchannel me to editor@boogcity.com

thanks,
david

Revolution is Bloody

"I believe as greater men before me have, that only with this mantra:
"Be a friend to the oppressed and an enemy to the oppressor", of this -
the inner and outer chant, can we Born an overstanding with the
Knowledge made manifest from Saddiq to Shariati to Sadr to Khomanie &
Khamanie, peace to our bruthas, Farrakhan to Nasrallah and Sistani. It
is with this do I hope to add on to the strength of the house, and
cipher the third degree of reality, that revolution is bloody so
everyday is ashura. What else can an island boy do to destroy
amerikkka...." Lawrence Ytzhak Braithwaite, aka Lord Patch, of New
Palestine/The Hood, gives a powerful and strikingly original portrayal
of life at the frontline between global imperialism and some of North
America's poorest communities.

Hi all,

Our poetry editor, the righteous Carol Mirakove, has decided to step down. A
hearty thanks to her for all her great work and ideas.

And now I'm excited to welcome Dana Ward on as Boog City's new poetry
editor, effective with the November issue. Dana is the editor/publisher of
one of my favorite presses, Cy Press, based in his home of Cincinnati. He
also has work which has recently appeared or is forthcoming in Aufgabe, Bird
Dog, The Tiny, and A Very Small Tiger.

as ever,
david

"Bill Berkson=B9s Sweet Singer of Modernism is an indispensable text for
anyone interested in late-twentieth-century culture. As a poet and critic o=
f
these times, as a witness and intimate participant, Berkson writes out of
his own taste and experience, but never about it. His devotion to the
seriousness and importance of his subjects is the very essence of modesty
and felicity. As a consequence, his most casual opinion bears the weight of
thoughtful moral authority. This is a wonderful book." =AD Dave Hickey

Dodie Bellamy and Eleni Stecopoulos
Read!
@ 21 Grand
449B 23rd St.
Oakland, CA 94612

Sunday, September 19th,
7-9 PM.  $4.

This month features Dodie Bellamy and Eleni Stecopoulos.

Bellamy is celebrating the release of her new collection of stories,
Pink Steam.  Railroad buffs know "pink steam" as the first blast from
a newly christened steam engine, which appears pink as it spews out
rust. And now Pink Steam, the book, reveals the intimate secrets of
Dodie Bellamy's life--sex, shoplifting, voyeurism, writing.  In Pink
Steam, Bellamy writes, "Anya flirted with the DJ as usual. I propped
a pillow against the wall, leaned back in my bed and lit a cigarette,
comforted by her high bell-like giggles. 'You're some far-out chick,'
the DJ punned. 'Rapping with you's like taking a hit of acid with a
sinsemilla chaser!' Anya's voice deepened, thickened like storm
clouds. 'Drugs and cigarettes burn holes in your aura,' she declared.
'Holes where demons burrow!'" Dodie's work has been widely
anthologized and has appeared in, among others, the anthologies
Pills, Thrills, Chills and Heartache, The Best American Erotica 2001,
High Risk, The Art of Practice: 45 Contemporary Poets, A Poeticsof
Criticism, The New Fuck You, Primary Trouble, and Moving Borders:
Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women. One of the original
"New Narrative" writers of the early and mid 80's, Dodie has worked
hard to bring together the sometimes disparate paths of art, poetry
and the novel, including a triumphant  five-year stint as director of
the seminal San Francisco writing lab, Small Press Traffic. She has
written often and vividly on contemporary  literature, transgression,
feminist and queer theory, AIDS and body issues. She is currently
working on The Fourth Form, a multi-dimensional sex novel.  Dodie
lives in San Francisco with the writer Kevin Killian and Blanche the
cat.  With Kevin she edits the San Francisco-based writing/art zine
they call Mirage #4/Period[ical].

Eleni Stecopoulos has published poetry and essays in journals
including Open Letter, ecopoetics, Chain, Rampike, and Zazil; work is
forthcoming from Mirage #4 Period(ical). She is seeking a publisher
for a hybrid book which charts connections between writing, energy
medicine, autoethnography, Artaud.  Stecopoulos's work is infused
with Greek, French and other languages, as it engages the pleasures
that result from such semantic  overlapping: "It is the job of the
linguist to simulate intimacy. / My grief is like my hair / The women
who listen along my body carry messages."

"It is subjectivity that forcibly brings the extremes together in the
moment, fills the dense polyphony with its tensions, breaks it apart with
the unisono, and disengages itself, leaving the naked tone behind; that sets
the mere phrase as a monument to what has been, marking a subjectivity
turned to stone. The caesuras, the sudden discontinuities that more than
anything else characterise the very late Beethoven, are those moments of
breaking away; the work is silent at the instant when it is left behind, and
turn its emptiness outward."
- Adorno, quoted in 'Thoughts on the Late Style', Edward Said, London Review
of Books, 5 August 2004, p3.

I am finally announcing my Pic-pOmBlog, few pOms but some pics,

Narcissus' Works is on at:
http://annyballardini.blogspot.com

What might be most interesting is a photo of Mary de Rachewiltz, Ezra
Pound's daughter and wonderful host I met last night at Brunnenburg
where she lives, on the occasion of the concert:

Voices and Piano - Part on Ezra Pound and other voices

(Bertolt Brecht, Guillaume Apollinaire, Lech Walesa, Pier Paolo
Pasolini, Bonnie Barnett, Morton Feldman, Hanna Schygulla, Gertrude
Stein, Ezra Pound, Agnes Gonxha Bojaxiu- Mother Theresa, and Mao
Tse-Tung)

 with Nicolas Hodges, piano, composed by Peter Ablinger (also present).

It was a cold, dark and rainy night, which brought to a very intimate evening.

a little Fiat sample:

from EPIC POEM

At this hour
Batman is in gotham city
Tomorrow batman will be far from here
Tomorrow batman will leave gotham city
In his batmobile
Until that time today
It is very hot
Under the light of the batlogo
That illuminates the night
Of the town of gotham city

When the police of gotham city need batman the police of gotham city
activate the light reflectors that draw batman=92s logo in the dark
night of gotham city

Then the sky in the black night of gotham city takes on the color of a
television screen

In gotham city batman says that he has a batmobile because technology is
the environment

The sky has the color of a television screen

In gotham city batman says that he has a batcopter because technology is
the environment

The sky has the color of a television screen

In gotham city batman says that he has a batcave because technology is
the environment

The sky is a television screen

In gotham city batman says that his real name is not =93batman=94 but =
that=20
his
real name is =93bruce wayne=94 because technology is the environment

Because the sky
Of gotham city
Is a television screen
Batman=92s batlogo that is drawn
In the black night
Of gotham city
Is a publicity spot
For the police of gotham city
And for the millionaire bruce wayne
Who calls himself Batman
Batman!
Batman!
Batman!

Batman!

Subject:      Ian Hamilton Finlay Book
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hello,
  My name is Shaun Smith and I'm currently working on my Master's Thesis at
Western Kentucky University.  My topic is Ian Hamilton Finlay and I'm
looking primarily into his use of collaboration and his shift in form.  I've
included a few questions (mostly the kind I'm looking to answer myself) on
which I would like some expert opinions.  Most answers will more than likely
be quoted in my thesis.  Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, Finlay doesn't
have massive volumes of research dedicated to his work, so I figured the
best way to go about getting answers to my questions would be just asking
directly...any answers you can give me will be a great help to me.  I also
have more questions, just in case you feel talkative, let me know and I can
send them as well.
Thanks in advance,
    Shaun
and without any further ado, the questions:

Did Finlay really escape the poetic frame with his garden?

Some of Finlay's images  (such as the birds landing on the aircraft carrier
feeder, tanks in the woods, machine guns on classic statues)  seem
surrealist...what makes them not so?

Finlay talks about his poetry moving back toward "the pure"...what do you
think about this idea?

Was Finlay's move from concrete poetry to works such as his garden a move
out of disgust with the movement or a broad extenstion of poetic and
syntactical liberation?

Finlay talks about "harmony"  in his works between nature and created works
and also classical imagery with modernity...do you believe this is assisted
by his collaborative efforts?

Does Finlay's collaboration with skilled artisans enrich the poetic process
or hinder the outcome?

Other collaborative works function within a "code" to ensure a more
unpredictable outcome, yet Finlay's collaborative works work toward a
specific goal...which is more poetically pure?

Finlay's work can represent a move back toward the classical idea of
"poesis" moreso than poetry, was this a way to liberate the words from the
page or can it be seen as a step toward liberating poetry from the highly
educated and into the hands of any who can create?

***WRITING WORKSHOPS***

=20
SURREALISM AND THE RADICAL IMAGINATION =AD=AD JANET HAMILL

Tuesdays at 7pm: 5 sessions begin October 12th
=B3Surrealism and the Radical Imagination=B2 will examine the complex nature of
imagination and its elements - illusionism, unreality, appearance, magic,
phantasm, fancy etc. - and the capacity of imagination to mediate between
the world of objective phenomena and subjective experience. The workshop
will look into the preoccupation of the Romanticists with imagination and
the sublime, the importance of the image to the Symbolists, and the
revolution brought about by the Surrealists to liberate poetic imagination
and take it to the realm of the marvelous.  Through means of Surrealist
games and methods, participants will be encouraged to cultivate their own
imaginations and enhance their imaginative writing skills.  A desire to
rescue poetry from some of its present unimaginative abuses is the only
requirement.

Janet Hamill has authored 4 books, most recently Lost Ceilings, a collectio=
n
of prose poems.  A second CD of words and music, in collaboration with the
band Moving Star, is slated for release in early 2005.


BRAINLINGO: WRITING THE VOICE OF THE BODY =AD=AD EDWIN TORRES

Tuesdays at 7pm: 5 sessions begin November 30
As artists we create our own communication, how we listen affects how we
speak, how we see our language affects how our voice is heard. Where the
senses meet each other is where poetry can begin. This workshop will be an
active creative laboratory that will explore how we communicate by
exercising the languages inside us. This is an active writing workshop
requiring a bottomless well and an open mind.

Edwin Torres=B9 books include The All-Union Day Of The Shock Worker, Fracture=
d
Humorous, I Hear Things People Haven=B9t Really Said, and his CDs Holy Kid
(Kill Rock Stars) and Novo (www.oozebap.org). He is co-editor of Rattapalla=
x
and has a show on PS.1=B9s internet-radio station (www.wps1.org) called LIVE
NUDE RADIO THEATER.


WRITING IN THE STEPMOTHER TONGUE =AD=AD OZ SHELACH

Thursdays at 7pm: 10 sessions begin October 14th
Many of us today write in English without being at home. A disability? An
advantage? How and when to adapt, defy, write with an accent, subvert, merg=
e
in, stand out? We'll play games devised by and for non-native writers in
English; Read worldwide fiction; Use supportive criticism. I hope all of us
will come out with deeper confidence in making our writing effective by
drawing on the richness of our difference.

Oz Shelach moved to NY after working as a journalist in Israel (and writing
in Hebrew) for many years. His novel, Picnic Grounds, was published by City
Lights in 2003.

=20
HAVING IT BOTH WAYS: THE PROSE POEM =AD=AD LARRY FAGIN

Fridays at 7pm: 10 sessions begin October 15th
A workshop designed for writers of both poetry and short prose (any genre),
who are interested in investigating the boundary between the two areas, or
those who have discovered such boundaries to be less than trustworthy. We
will read (Baudelaire, Stein, Ponge, Ashbery, Lydia Davis, Killarney Clary,
et al), exchange ideas (story, description, image, abstraction, the
personal), and refine our writing with an eye toward publication. Weekly
reading and writing assignments.

Larry Fagin edits Adventures in Poetry (books) and Sal Mimeo (magazine). He
teaches "experimental poetry" at New School University. Coma Rock, a prose
poem, will appear as a chapbook in Winter 2004.


ROCKS AND IDEAS =AD=AD RACHEL LEVITSKY

Saturdays at 12pm: 10 sessions begin October 16th
William Carlos Williams famously said, "--Say it, no ideas but in things--,=
=B2
a line which can be variously interpreted. In our virtual era, ideas and
things may a) be difficult to distinguish and b) have a tendency to morph
into each other.  Williams himself writes an introduction to his long poem
=B3Paterson,=B2 that explains the idea behind the long work. In this workshop w=
e
will experiment with things while having big fat ideas. We'll look at other
important modern and post modern works like Anne Waldman's Iovis, Harryette
Mullen's S*PeRM**K*T and Will Alexander's Asia and Haiti (and others) to
help us along.=20

Rachel Levitsky=B9s books include Under the Sun (Futurepoem, 2003) and the
chapbooks Cartographies of Error (Leroy, 1999) and Dearly, (a+bend, 1999).
She is the founder and co-curator of the Belladonna* Series in New York
City.

Project membership and tuition for any and all fall and spring classes.

I'd like to thank eveyone who has responded to my request.  I've forwarded
all replies, both on list and private, to my film buff friend.  I don't
think that he will ask his audience to read Finnegan's Wake -- that would
scare away too many of them.  But I think that he will like some of your
other suggestions.

Fathers and daughters.  There must be a companion piece somewhere to
Lawrence's "Sons and Lovers" -- no?

Dear List,

A friend is organizing a film series on the theme of father-daughter
relationships.  He would like to use an anthology of poetry related to that
theme -- if there is one.

He has asked me to help, and now I turn to you....

Can anyone recommend something?

Thanks in advance,

Subject:      Poet Laureate Debate
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Disposition: inline
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

It is my hope that the 'office' of Poet Laureate not become the laughing stock of the employment gallery, if it has not become so already because of the lack of insight by those appointed. I'm not too familiar with the outcome of past Laureates (perhaps I should do my research?) but I'm all for it, in a certain number of conditions.

The first would be the condition that such a Laureate should define his or her position in terms of what poetry IS (not in an aesthetic sense or the political, because WE already know what it is capable of, but in the cultural/social sense, i.e., its dissemination and acknowledgement as a tool for change by the general public, in schools primarily, early on) and commit to reversing its status among the general public as a DEAD ART. What's the point of a Poet Laureate if 'poetry for the people' cannot be their constant and defining attitude?

The second would be a condition that the Poet Laureate sidestep established forms of teaching poetry (that is of looking for meaning and agreeing on that meaning and building this so called 'community of empathy' and basically disengaging the peoples' right to challenge established notions, 'textbook ideology' let's call it) and participate in debates with many schools of writing and reading.

The third (and the last for me for now) would be to make poetry accessible and, god forbid, FREE, with more opportunities for writers to be funded by arts programs. A coup? Sack Congress and demand more money for schools and poetry and poetry in schools. I'm sure there are ways to divert funds going into Ir. and Af. just by a push of the button; but, alas, there are no poet computer geniuses. But What about Alan Sondheim? I'm getting ahead of myself... 'Poet Laureate' should be, must be, ought to be synonymous with 'Liberator.'

Too political? Challenge it.

I can support such notions as those above, but the one most important is: dissemination. Free poetry for all and lots of money for writers. OK two things. But you understand what I mean.

If a Poet Laureate, the most famousest poet person there is in all this land, free or not, cannot build enough respect for his or her immediate craft, a craft that defines their position and a postition of many, well, then...

A question- I am putting together a lecture/talk about fascist/quisling
poets and intellectuals. People who compromised or actively were pro fascist
during WW 2 I am also putting together the same for Poets who
collaborated/supported Stalinism. I am then comparing this list with those
whom resisted and trying to discern with the group what made the difference?

As of today I have the following list I would like any suggestions from you
all on other names that could be included;

Fascist/Nazi/Falange

Ezra Pound
Martin Heidegger
Jean Cocteau
Celine
FT Marienetti

A useful place to start that research is Poetry's
Catbird Seat: the Consultantship in Poetry in the
English Language at the Library of Congress 1937-1987,
by William McGuire, a really lovely book published by
the Library of Congress.

The Post-Apollo Press Proudly Presents its New Fall Titles:





Memnoir
by Joan Retallack


Poetry          50 pages                $10.00          ISBN 0-942996-54-2

Memnoir is a high-speed chase through intersections of chance and consciousness in the "experience of experiencing" our lives.  Movies and memory swap visceral/ visual thrills with mathematics and philosophy as Retallack plays with our reliance on symbols and cultural frames of reference to get to the point of a given moment.  Pitting present tense against coincidence, Memnoir  reconfigures the geometry of attention, coordinating the known world with the unpredictable pleasures of a more complex system of meaning.


Joan Retallack has almost single handedly convinced us that the avant garde is still the avant garde.  Her own work is always distinctive for its unpredictable pleasures.  In Memnoir she turns our attention to the unpredictable patterns of memory.  A stunning poem.

-Julianna Spahr




Self-Destruction
by Laura Moriarty

Poetry         125 pages                  $14.00                    ISBN 0-942996-51-8


Enter Self-Destruction, an uneasy harmonics between self, self-representation, self, and other.  Dissonant, deceptive, their frequencies resound throughout the text, amplifying and collapsing difference.  In the cosmology of Self-Destruction, the unified "I" breaks into a constellation of truths existing at different intervals.  Using language as a medium of displacement, the poems enact the threats and possibilities of the self's desire to rhyme itself into a recognizable convention.


"My mind.  Our work.  The war."  In Self-Destruction Laura Moriarty powerfully presents us with a mystery.  An author is being pursued by her character.  She sees this and she sees that.  One of the two has to pay for the other.  "But the world is a threat."  While we hope for ambiguity-ending relations in this time of transitive, empty war nothing is ever settled.

-Susan Howe




Mind-God and The Properties of Nitrogen
by Fouad Gabriel Naffah
Translated from the French by Norma Cole

96 pages with cover and 4 inserts in color pastels by Irving Petlin

$24.00          ISBN 0-942996-53-4          7 x 9 1/4" trim size

Lebanese poet Fouad Gabriel Naffah's Mind-God and The Properties of Nitrogen charts the mind's progress through the material world to the realm of pure spirit.  "To understand is just/ the synonym for to grasp," he writes.  Apprehended, the world survives as trace elements in the mind's experience, in turn refined into concept, ideal, until all images fall away and the spirit frees itself.  Crystalline, elusive, his poetry frustrates our tendency to consume form and meaning whole, without first appreciating the subtleties binding them more closely together.

Through her masterful translation, Cole further distills the text, disintegrating and reintegrating its spirit into English.



The economy of Naffah's poetry raises possibilities of relationships of equivalence, harmonics, between writing and life in the material world.  "Restricted" would be an understatement.  In a way it is all understatement, the understatement of an extravagant boldness.
-from the Introduction by Norma Cole

Dear Buffalo list friends:

I am pleased to announce that Kenneth Goldsmith has been appointed this
year's Fellow in Poetics & Poetic Practice at Penn's Center for Programs in
Contemporary Writing. Among Kenny's activities as Fellow will be to teach a
writing seminar called "Uncreative Writing" (the course description begins
thus: "It's clear that long-cherished notions of creativity are under
attack, eroded by file-sharing, media culture, widespread sampling, and
digital replication. How does writing respond to this new environment?")

For more about the CPCW Fellow in Poetics & Poetic Practice, see

        http://www.writing.upenn.edu/poeticsfellow.html

For Kenny's EPC page, go to

        http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/goldsmith/

For the recorded webcast of Kenny's September 21, 2000 visit to the Writers
House, see

        http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~wh/webcasts/goldsmith.html

Kenneth Goldsmith took a BFA in sculpture, is a visual artist of great
range, publishes as an innovative poet and has created and continually
edits what is by far the most comprehensive web site of visual, concrete
and sound poetry (UbuWeb). His most recent work includes DAY, HEAD
CITATIONS, and SOLILOQUY.

His earlier books and compact discs include Tizzy Boost, a collaboration
with Bruce Andrews (1993); 73 Poems, published by Permanent Press
(Brooklyn, NY, 1994) with essays by Robert Mahoney, John Schaefer, and
Geoffrey Young; No. 111 2.7.96-19.20.96 (The Figures, 1997); and Fidget
(Coach House Books, 2000). Fidget is Goldsmith's transcription of every
movement made by his body during thirteen hours on Bloomsday (June 16),
1997. Originally commissioned by the Whitney Museum of American Art as a
collaboration with vocalist Theo Bleckmann, Fidget attempts to reduce the
body to a catalogue of mechnical movements by a strict act of observation.
The online edition of Fidget at www.chbooks.com includes the full text, a
self-running Java applet version written by programmer Clem Paulsen, and a
selection of RealAudio recordings from Theo Bleckmann's vocal/visual
performance at the Whitney on Bloomsday, 1998.

In her afterword to No. 111 2.7.96-19.20.96, Marjorie Perloff has written
that it "is an encyclopedic poem based on words ending in the sound ah, a
collection of words drawn from conversation, books, phone calls, radio
shows, newspapers, television and especially the internet, arranged
alphabetically and by syllable count so as to create a Gargantuan poetic
reference book or archive of the argot of our times."

T. S. Eliot and William Butler Yeats were in various ways apologists for
fascism. Whether they count as Fascists per se is something of a contentious
issue amongst some. Wyndham Lewis is also an interesting person to take into
account during all this.

Jaime Saenz, as I learned on Jacket Magazine, was a fascist. Jorge Luis
Borges was an anti-nazi at a time when many Argentine Deutschofiles were
pro-nazi. Cesar Vallejo was a communist, but I'm not sure if you could call
him a Stalinist. Gabriel Garcia Marquez considers Fidel Castro a friend.

You could find some Chinese poets who were pro-Maoist or anti-Maoist and see
if that has any bearing on your research (Guo Moruo was something of a
Chinese Mayakovsky, for instance; Mao Dun went from being a great writer to
hack because of the rise of the Communist Party; Bei Dao was a Red Guard as
a teenager, but was later exiled from the People's Republic).

You might also want to look into Brecht. He wasn't primarily a poet (but he
did write poems), but he was anti-nazi and communist. Whether this communism
turned into Stalinism, I'm not sure. Thomas Mann and Herman Hesse both fled
Germany when Hitler came to power.

And of course Nabokov was an anti-Communist his whole life.

Pablo Picasso painted Guernica to express Franco's fascist destruction of
Spain, and joined the communist party later on, though I wonder if that
wasn't more for publicity than politics.

George Orwell was anti-Stalinist and anti-fascist.

How broad do you want to go? W. E. B. DuBois turned very communist in the
later half of his life, eventually renouncing his American citizenship a
year or two before he died. Jean Paul Sartre was an apologist for Stalinism
at times. Foucault wrote an article in favor of the Iranian revolution.

Amiri Baraka is, well, Amiri Baraka, and may have any extremist view at any
given moment.

Lucas

Can someone recommend a good bio of Tristan Tzara?  I'm especially
interested in any details of his early years in Moinesti, Romania.   Me
& the family are headed there next month to shake hands with his statue.

Also Im puzzling over the accounts that say the word "dada" comes from
the french meaning hobbyhorse.  In Romanian, of course, dada would
translate as yesyes which seems both logical & obvious. Does Tzara
himself say that it refers to hobbyhorse?

Jung, Giraudoux, Dos Passos.

A silly topic, finally, because support for one or the other was usually
situational--seemed ideologically appropriate at the time or was
survival-enhancing. Also rather dependent on the degree to which an
individual understood what was meant (which I think means what you mean) by
fascism or stalinism. The terms were not stable. It's good to remember the
massive desertion of non-Russian communists from the party when Stalin and
Hitler made their pact in 1939. Also that even now a lot of neo-Nazis
maintain their political allegiance by denying that most of the crimes
actually took place. And for a long time it was difficult in the extreme to
decide who was a Leninist who a Stalinist. Until the purge trials, for
instance, a strong argument for party loyalty could be made for Platonov
and Eisenstein.

So, until say 1968 almost all Cuban writers considered themselves
Communists, fewer and fewer since then.

Somehow I find this somewhat reductionist, since people's politics and
their art usually don't easily fit into such categories.  I'm particularly
confused by "Stalinist" -- Nazim Hikmet received the Lenin Prize, spent
years in jail for incitement for his poems, lived in exile in the Soviet
Union.  So I suppose you can call him a Stalinist.  But what of poets who
were supporters of the Ataturk regime?  Are they fascists?  How do you
categorize the Ataturk regime?  Peronists in Argentina?  Now, if you asked
if people were members of the Communist Party (or parties) in their
countries you might have a clearer way of distinguishing people during much
of the 20th century.  But even that is difficult.  Amiri Baraka for years
was part of what was called the "New Communist Movement" -- generally
pro-Mao Marxist-Leninists -- or he referred to himself as a revolutionary
nationalist.  Tawfiq Zayad, Palestinian poet, late Mayor of Nazareth, was a
CP member of the Knesset -- that seems straightforward, except that his
politics were far less "militant" than, say, Khassan Kanafani, who was a
member of the PFLP before he was assassinated by the Israelis.  Sympathies
or leftwing or rightwing politics are more complex.  I feel uncomfortable
reducing these political relationships to code words.  I mean, Ezra Pound
made broadcasts for the fascist regime -- but he may really have been nuts,
and a stay at St. Elizabeth's may have been the best thing for him (rather
than execution!) -- yet his poems resonate far beyond his screwball politics.

Tzara refers to the hobbyhorse meaning, at least once,
in the 1918 Manifesto. His argument there, though, is
that "Dada does not mean anything." Of course.

My favorite is the Kru African definition of dada
which, reportedly, means a cow's tail. I don't think
any of the primary dadas mention that one though.

There there,
S

Well, in the 1918 Manifesto, Tzara mentioned both the hobbyhorse & the
double affirmative:

"We read in the papers that the negroes of the Kroo race call the tail of a
sacred cow: DADA. A cube, and a mother, in a certain region of Italy, are
called: DADA. The word for a hobby-horse, a children's nurse, a double
affirmative in Russian and Roumanian, is also: DADA."

That's great news.  Congratulations Kenny.  I've seen the webcast -- it's =

Dear Buffalo list friends:

I am pleased to announce that Kenneth Goldsmith has been appointed this
year's Fellow in Poetics & Poetic Practice at Penn's Center for Programs =
in
Contemporary Writing. Among Kenny's activities as Fellow will be to teach =
a
writing seminar called "Uncreative Writing" (the course description begins
thus: "It's clear that long-cherished notions of creativity are under
attack, eroded by file-sharing, media culture, widespread sampling, and
digital replication. How does writing respond to this new environment?")

For more about the CPCW Fellow in Poetics & Poetic Practice, see

        http://www.writing.upenn.edu/poeticsfellow.html

For Kenny's EPC page, go to

        http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/goldsmith/

For the recorded webcast of Kenny's September 21, 2000 visit to the =
Writers
House, see

        http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~wh/webcasts/goldsmith.html

Kenneth Goldsmith took a BFA in sculpture, is a visual artist of great
range, publishes as an innovative poet and has created and continually
edits what is by far the most comprehensive web site of visual, concrete
and sound poetry (UbuWeb). His most recent work includes DAY, HEAD
CITATIONS, and SOLILOQUY.

His earlier books and compact discs include Tizzy Boost, a collaboration
with Bruce Andrews (1993); 73 Poems, published by Permanent Press
(Brooklyn, NY, 1994) with essays by Robert Mahoney, John Schaefer, and
Geoffrey Young; No. 111 2.7.96-19.20.96 (The Figures, 1997); and Fidget
(Coach House Books, 2000). Fidget is Goldsmith's transcription of every
movement made by his body during thirteen hours on Bloomsday (June 16),
1997. Originally commissioned by the Whitney Museum of American Art as a
collaboration with vocalist Theo Bleckmann, Fidget attempts to reduce the
body to a catalogue of mechnical movements by a strict act of observation.
The online edition of Fidget at www.chbooks.com includes the full text, a
self-running Java applet version written by programmer Clem Paulsen, and a
selection of RealAudio recordings from Theo Bleckmann's vocal/visual
performance at the Whitney on Bloomsday, 1998.

In her afterword to No. 111 2.7.96-19.20.96, Marjorie Perloff has written
that it "is an encyclopedic poem based on words ending in the sound ah, a
collection of words drawn from conversation, books, phone calls, radio
shows, newspapers, television and especially the internet, arranged
alphabetically and by syllable count so as to create a Gargantuan poetic
reference book or archive of the argot of our times."

Let's have some fun. OK, so Neruda's out--he was a Stalinist, but in the
wrong place, so I guess he doesn't count. Jung--fascist, but changed his
mind. Peron--fascist in the same sense as the others? Consistently?

Stalinism--changes in the 30s, sheds a lot of true believers. Was it
Stalinism before the purges?

Neo-fascist--probably a meaningless list, here synonymous with "repressive
non-theocratic regimes," ( you missed a few) otherwise very different from
each other. I thought you meant military dictatorships until you got to the
last three, but of course most of your "classic fascist regimes" weren't
militrary dictatorships either. For the record, tho the PRI famously
ordered the massacres of demonstrators in 1968-1970, writers and
intellectuals have published what they wanted when they wanted. For most of
its history it's been rather more corrupt than repressive, with only the
occasional assassination of political (not intellectual) opponents, and not
always for political reasons.

The major problem remains: writers and intellectuals maintained allegiance
to or opposed one regime or kind of regime or another based on often wildly
divergent understandings of those regimes. It's hard to see how your list
could be illuminating.

Raven Hymn Productions presents the official CD release party for:


RADICAL FOLK OF THE GREAT NORTH
JOEY ONLY AND THE COMRADES
sunday, october 3rd, 7:30PM, 324 cambie ST.
the afro-canadian restaurant


Comrades this is bound to be a dandy production, prob’ly the only one like
it on this side of hell. I am releasing a brand new CD and I want you to
all be part of the occasion. I have dreamed for a long time about the day
that I would release a CD of my work, that dream is about to pass, and you
must be there to share it with me. This party also commemorates the 37th
anniversary of the passing of Woody Guthrie. Vancouver Eastside’s most
anticipated new three peice punk rock group is going to get things
underway later in the evening, they are called THEE ARRESTED. Thee
Arrested features Stiff Josh on guitar, Punk Sean on bass and me (joey
only) on the drums. Why won’t you come hang out in the Afro-Canadian
Restaurant, drink some beer in the basement, and come along for the ride.


FEATURING THE PERFORMANCES OF:
Andy Mason and the Tricksters - folk rock
Thee Arrested - anarcho-punk metal band
David Roy Parsons - working class songwriter
Beto - Latin American Folk
Lukka - and friends
Joanna Chapman Smith - Modern Folk
plus more...

and...JOEY ONLY with his new CD:



RADICAL FOLK OF THE GREAT NORTH
I, Joey Only, have been playing in punk, rock, blues, jazz, and folk
groups for over 10 years. For the last four years I have been singing
politicized folk music to happy audiences first in Belleville Ontario as a
member of the Tenant Action Group. Since then I have travelled the
country singing songs that fit with my red-green-Zen-and-black
anarchist-worldview, playing with David Rovics, Flying Folk Army, Anne
Feeney, Chris Chandler, Rae Spoon, Bakunins Bum/One Speed Bike/Norman
Nawrocki and many more. My unique style of playing and singing are
sometimes put away to do my infamous Johnny Cash impressions, to sing
Woody Guthrie, Utah Philips or any of the old songs.

RADICAL FOLK OF THE GREAT NORTH is perhaps the most radical record to ever
talk about the Canadian situation. As it is a gift to radicals I fought
alongside this record tells the story of organizers, fighters, tragedies
and more. If you don’t know which song to play on your show read these
write-ups of every track. This record features the vocals of Lukka, the
violin and vocals of Megan Adams, David Roy Parsons and Andy Mason on the
banjo, harmonica, mandolin and more. It was produced by David Roy
Parsons, Engineered by Roger X


1.THE BEST YEARS, 2:28 - solo - A song about going to jail too young and
coming out too old. A song about missing mom and all the good things she
does, especially when a pile of slop is put on yer prison tray! This is a
stomping and plucking fun number.

2.PERSISTENT PETERBOROUGH POVERTY PROBLEM, 2:22 - full ensemble of
electric guitar, bass, whistling, accoustic, djembe and more. A rock’n
tune about the town with the highest rate of homelessness in Ontario.
Mentions the Peterborough Coalition Against Poverty and the Water Street
Squat of 2003.

3.SONG FOR A BC FIGHTBACK, 6:03 - solo with gang vocals in final chorus.
This is the ultimate song about the BC political situation. Each verse is
crammed full of what people have done to resist colonization and the
Campbell Government. There is a good chance that if you did something
radical in BC it will get mentioned here!! This song is my mom’s favorite
and is very funny yet country-folkish!

4.MEETING NIKI, 3:53 - 2 guitars and Andy Masons harmonica work. This is
a very lovely sounding number about how Direct Action Casework is the tool
poor people use to fightback against beauracracy. In Belleville Ontario
the Tenant Action Group prevented 1263 Hydro Cut-offs. It all began when
Niki came to TAG for help, soon she was their best warrior!!

5.THE WORKING POOR, 4:12 - guitar, bass, piano - The Mike Harris
Government in Ontario did away with the 40 hour work week. That’s
bullshit because I think that a 20 hour work week is too long, 60 hours is
legalized insanity! I deserve more, you deserve more, that’s what this
song is for.

6.I DREAMED I SAW DUDLEY GEORGE LAST NIGHT, 5:05 - solo - There is an old
song called I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill, which was also sung for Phil Oakes,
which was also sung for Judi Bari, and now is sung for Dudley George. He
was sub-machine gunned down in Ipperwash Provincial Park on Sept.6th 1995
and we know that the Ontario Government intended to send a message to all
native soveriegntists that day.

7.OCTOBER 16th 2001, DEFEAT HARRIS, 4:17 - solo - this song is about how
the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty began greater movement of the
Ontario Common Front. This is a song about the day Mike Harris announced
his resignation from Premier and how a militant march through Toronto’s
economic core met the riot cops and tactically defeated them.

8.FIRE ON ANARCHIST MOUNTAIN, 4:05 - full ensemble of violin, gang vocals,
harmonica, mandolin, banjo, bass. There is a place called Anarchist
Mountain near Osooyoos British Columbia that caught on fire last summer.
At first I thought it happened so that the fire would blow into the US and
burn it all up, and it would be a sign of the revolution because it began
on Anarchist Mountain. This year I think that the fire happened just so I
would have a great bluegrass song on my record.

9.NO ONE IS ILLEGAL, 5:46 - full ensemble, violin, harmonica, bass,
vocals, mandolin. This is certainly the most powerfull song on the
record. It lyrics tell people to tear down the borders as they are just
constructs of tyranny and oppression. The moving music, anti-racist
message, touching lyrics, and fabulous ending have made people say that
this is their favorite on the record. It’s certainly my favorite!

Your help is greatly appreciated.

The House of Nice Virus

Glorious view with not a lot of pedestrians. Too many rivers to cross &
the bridges are narrow & rickety. The Mr Gray house weary & in need of
paint, on the hill. Seldom visited & less seldom is anyone seen
managing the cleverly assorted menagery or oriental trees.

POV: art against cultural imperialism
===============================

Art at War: Revolutionary Art Against Cultural Imperialism
by Ewuare Osayande

What does it mean to create poetry in a time of war? What does it mean
to create any art
during a time when the United States, the sole superpower on the planet,
is primed to do
what Nazi Germany wished it could have done? For one, it means to create
at a time when
masses of people, guilty of no crime, unless it is a crime to be poor
and oppressed, are
being slaughtered in the streets, when bombs rain down death daily. It
means to create art
when life literally hangs in the balance, when so many are relying on
others they may
never see to insure their survival. We, who reside in the belly of this
beast, are those others.

In this climate of anger and fear the question becomes: Where are your
allegiances? And
can we see those allegiances in your art?

If you think that you can avoid having an allegiance, taking a side,
then you have done
so even in your attempt not to. Those that refuse to take sides are
giving their power over
to those who are in power. And if those who are in power are oppressive,
then you, by
your silence or loud noise of saying nothingness, showcase your
allegiance in clear sight
and signal.

We live in a time of mass confusion. This confusion has become a
commodity created by
those in power to keep the public in a state of disarray, for in that
state the people cannot
organize to bring down the enemy because they donâ€™t know who the real
enemy is. Is
Bin Laden the enemy? Al Qaeda?  Or is it Saddam Hussein? Could it be
Bush, Rumsfeld
or Cheney? Or maybe the CIA? Or are they all the same? Artists that
refuse to inform and
help bring clarity in this period of paranoia and state-endorsed frenzy
are working on
behalf of those that are creating and profiting from the confusion. And
to think, they are
not even getting paid for it.

Before the artist can bring clarity, they first must be clear and too
many of us artists are
not clear at all. So many of us claim disdain for the mainstream, while
we secretly long to
be discovered by Hollywood, Broadway or MTV, or any of its colored
extensions. And as
if to justify our contradictory desires, we got artists confused to the
point that they think
they are revolutionary, and when asked what makes them or their art
revolutionary, their
response is that they got to say their political poem on MTV or HBO. The
fact is that
being granted an opportunity to say your poem on nationwide television
does not make
you revolutionary. The reason lies in understanding that the very
corporations that
sponsored your five minutes of fame are the very capitalist institutions
that profit from
our oppression in the first place! Capitalism doesnâ€™t care if you cry or
complain about
how bad it is. It will put you on the stage and give you pennies while
it takes the millions
it earns from your image reproduced in a number of mediums for years to
come to the
bank, and you will still be on the street ranting on and on about how
bad the system is.
Capitalism functions to profit. It doesnâ€™t have a heart to be assuaged
or made to feel
guilt. It has no conscience.  It cannot be talked out of its
machinations. It functions to
exploit. It functions to oppress. The degree you are complicit with it,
is the degree that
you will be oppressed by it.

Given this contradictory position, there is no cultural movement to
change our society.
Too many are too busy trying to get in, to be seen, to be heard. â€œDef
Poetry Jamâ€ aint
revolutionary. It is a show. It is not the bastion of free speech that
many folk try to claim
either. It is taped and edited. The producers decide what poets will
appear and which of
the poems they taped them reciting will be aired. It is not as
democratic as aspiring artists
might want to believe. Those who make the final decisions are making
those decisions in
the editing room, and their motivation is not social progress. Their
primary motivation is
to promote the corporation(s) that sponsors the program. We all know
that Hip hop got
got by the corporate elite awhile ago. Spoken Word is on the take as we
speak. We are
following hustlers and con-artists that have taken our art and handed it
right over to the
bourgeoisie. They have handed our culture right into the hands of a few
individuals whose
main interest is in maximizing profit at the expense of the people. And
now we run in
after them and call that progress. But what is progress? And for whom?
It canâ€™t be for the
people when they are still oppressed. It canâ€™t be progress for the
people when they are still
being locked up in prison at record numbers, when they are still being
fired at ever
increasing rates, when they are still having their civil, human and
natural rights robbed
from them right under their eyes.

Our oppressors are not scared of us when they see us in these venues.
Russell Simmonsâ€™s
Def Poetry on Broadway is another good example of this. The elites that
come to see the
show are not coming to have their notion of the world troubled. And the
poets who
appeared in the Broadway production knew this and responded accordingly
as evidenced
by the testimony of Staceyann Chin in an article she wrote for Black
Issues Book Review
(May/April 2004): â€œThe show became everything. I began a quiet that
spread from my
fingers to my tongue. I worried about what my cannonball of a mouth
might do to the
show. I stopped saying Bush was a spawn of the Devil. I toned down my
lesbian self for
the larger, more conservative media audiences.â€ Def Poetry Jam on
Broadway is not the
longed-for site of radical discourse. It is a site where elites and
their friends come to have
a good time. And when they leave, they are not troubled. They are on the
cell phone
calling their accountant to see how their stocks are doing on Wall
Street. Just like whites
who pay money out of the surplus of their incomes to watch Chris Rock
and Dave Chapelle
call them crackers and racists. Their response is not to be angry or
even to feel guilt but
to giggle. They not scared. They are laughing at them(selves). Why?
Cause it is a joke. Itâ€™s
not supposed to be taken seriously.

Only action is taken seriously. It was only when Black folks in
Montgomery, Alabama
decided to take action and boycott the bus company that they get the
change they were
seeking. Not singing, praying or pleading but organized action. Boycott.
Hit them where
it hurts. How many artists are willing to boycott the corporate elite?
How many artists are
willing to boycott the exploitation of poor women and women and men of
color? Those
who organized themselves in Montgomery made a conscious decision to
boycott the buses,
to stay out of the public transportation system. They set up car pools
and the like as a
functional alternative. How many of us are willing to stay out the
studios of the mainstream
media? Stop allowing ourselves and our art to be exploited by the
cultural imperialists and
start to create a true alternative, one that actually resists the
superstructure and its
enticements.

When Amiri Baraka wrote and made public his poem, â€œSomebody Blew Up
America,â€
he was attacked by the capitalist state. They tried to oust him from his
post as Poet
Laureate of the state of New Jersey. He wasnâ€™t rewarded by the
reactionary forces that
perpetuate the oppression he exposes in the poem. He was attacked.
Called a liar.
Demonized. Although his words and ideas are being validated with each
new day as the
truth is slowly coming to light. His experience serves as an example for
us and should
have been a catalyst for us to organize. When will we realize that we do
not create art
for the applause of our oppressors? As Baraka has stated himself, â€œIt is
a new world we
want to create, not an endowed chair in the concentration camp.â€ Yet too
many of us
are too invested in such endowments and masquerade that desire as
wanting to change
the world. No, you just want to change your status in the world.

But understand this: Most of the worldâ€™s singers, actors, dancers,
writers, poets and
painters arenâ€™t creating art but are working somewhere in a field or a
factory, in a plant
or on a plantation, or they are in prison or dead in the grave. These
people will never be
seen on stage, will never record a CD or get a film made, but their
voices are as valid as
any of ours, if not more so. But due to the economic reality the world
is in, due to the
fact that the natural resources of their land and their labor has been
stolen, they are
doomed to a life of servitude and peasantry and slavery. We live a life
of extreme luxury
when compared to that reality. Our art, if it is to be functional and
purposeful in the real
world must be accountable to the masses of people who will never have
the same
opportunity to speak their truth in defiance of those who dominate them.
What we do,
whether we fight on their behalf or not, is what makes our art relevant
or makes us a
contradiction as we complain about not getting grants from philanthropic
filth, the very
corporate and governmental funders that profit from the poverty around
the world. Where
do you think the surplus comes from?

The art that is most needed in a time of war is an art that is
revolutionary. An art that
recognizes the reality of war for what it is, how it decimates whole
peoples, vanquishes
hope and rapes them of their capacity to envision a future of
possibility, peace and
prosperity. We have to fight that. Not enough to call for peace then
fail to understand
and address why peace is not present as though to simply shout â€œPeaceâ€
is going to make
it come. We have to aim our art at the very heart of the beast and
shoot! Speak the truth!
Expose the emperorâ€™s ugly nakedness so that the people will see that
they have the power,
not him. That is our purpose when we are clear. Not stuck in some
abstraction, nursing
some sordid desire to escape. Those artists that use their art not to
engage the reality of
the present world but to escape it are not aiding but abetting our
ability to reach the
freedom the world seeks. Their escapist art is like a drug. But even the
worst addict will
tell you that once the hit has worn off, you realize that you still here
and you got to
expend all your energy searching for your next hit. You never arrive at
nirvana. You are
always in search of it. Escapism has no end. The perpetual pathology of
apathetic art is
pathetic.

The people are already being fed a daily diet of escapism and
abstraction every time they
turn on the TV, the radio, every time they go to the movies. So we need
art that will push
people out of our collective slumber. Out of our apathy. Out of our
sense of powerlessness.
We can change our reality only when we are willing to come face to face
with it. We have
to begin to redefine the world in a way that gives us new vision, new
solutions. That
requires a revolutionary aesthetic. A revolutionary means of identifying
and defining
beauty. Not some prosthetic aesthetic â€“ a dangling fake appendage to an
imperialist culture
that seeks only one purpose â€“ to eat the world whole and all life within
it. There is nothing
beautiful about the Bush administration. There is no beauty in lies.
Whatever is beautiful
is what we create by confronting our reality with truth. They say the
first casualty of war
is the truth. We must resurrect truth with our words and images and defy
those that would
deny us our voice. Our first effort if we are against war is to get the
warmongers out
office. To get the ugly white lie out of power. We must create
resistance and a new vision
of the world that can be made real in our time. That requires organized
action.

As Angela Davis has written, â€œProgressive and revolutionary art is
inconceivable outside
the context of political movements for radical change. â€¦ Cultural
workers must thus be
concerned not only with the creation of progressive art, but must be
actively involved in
the organization of peopleâ€™s political movements.â€

Poetry is not a panacea. It is creative expression first and last. It is
what you express that
matters. It what you express that makes your poetry, your song, your
painting meaningful
in the end. In the end, art at its highest desire is in pursuit of a
better world. In order for
our art to be a part of that process, it must work toward the benefit of
the masses, which
are oppressed by imperialism, war and poverty. Not the elite few who
rule by bombs and
lies, guns and pink-slips.

What we do on the behalf of the worldâ€™s masses is what will last. In the
end our art must
engage the world as it is, not just to be seen or heard, but to change
it for the benefit of
the worldâ€™s betterment.

$175, $150 for members

Time to brush off that manuscript somewhere buried, take the plunge, and
make the commitment to write the great American novel. Yes, the brass ring
can be yours, but first you must write the story. For both veterans and
novices, this seminar will present the critical foundations necessary to
assist you in writing a novel. Topics include: developing plots, building
character, generating scenes and, finally, how to make it all make sense.

Linda Lavid is author of Rented Rooms. Her work has appeared in The Southern
Cross Review, Plots With Guns, Wilmington Blues, and Over Coffee.

gasping for air beneath the clutter in your desk? Then it's time to come out
of the drawer. Learn to capture your readers with an intriguing "Hook;"
build Believable Characters; use a single Point Of View, Identify a
Conflict, Show Rather Than Tell and Market your work to an editor.

the Institute of Children's Literature has published books for everyone from

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and
taverns!),mutilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented
forms. We will explore the structural possibilities of language to
ultimately answer the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning
and practiced poets will generate lots of original writing from this full
day of language play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye
with which to revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Marj Hahne is a poet and teaching artist who has performed and taught
extensively around the country. Her work has appeared in Paterson Literary
Review, Painted Bride Quarterly, Schuylkill Valley Journal of the Arts, Mad
Poets Review, and La Petite Zine. She also has a CD titled notspeak.

the apocalypse is in my bones.
the destruction is now.

when you hear the sirens, remember this.
i warned you and i warned you not to destroy me.
you didn't listen and that's why you're where you are today.

I don't know how comparable the costs are but, at
Badham Library (Life Sciences library) - at Sydney
University where I work, we recommend and use Endnote
for all the honours, postgrad, academic
clients - it works a treat.

We're Not in Lake Wobegon Anymore
By Garrison Keillor     August 26, 2004
Something has gone seriously haywire with the Republican Party. Once, it was
the party of pragmatic Main Street businessmen in steel-rimmed spectacles
who decried profligacy and waste, were devoted to their communities and
supported the sort of prosperity that raises all ships. They were
good-hearted people who vanquished the gnarlier elements of their party, the
paranoid Roosevelt-haters, the flat Earthers and Prohibitionists, the
antipapist antiforeigner element. The genial Eisenhower was their man, a
genuine American hero of D-Day, who made it OK for reasonable people to vote
Republican. He brought the Korean War to a stalemate, produced the
Interstate Highway System, declined to rescue the French colonial army in
Vietnam, and gave us a period of peace and prosperity, in which (oddly)
American arts and letters flourished and higher education burgeoned-and
there was a degree of plain decency in the country. Fifties Republicans were
giants compared to today's. Richard Nixon was the last Republican leader to
feel a Christian obligation toward the poor.
In the years between Nixon and Newt Gingrich, the party migrated southward
down the Twisting Trail of Rhetoric and sneered at the idea of public
service and became the Scourge of Liberalism, the Great Crusade Against the
Sixties, the Death Star of Government, a gang of pirates that diverted and
fascinated the media by their sheer chutzpah, such as the misty-eyed
flag-waving of Ronald Reagan who, while George McGovern flew bombers in
World War II, took a pass and made training films in Long Beach. The Nixon
moderate vanished like the passenger pigeon, purged by a legion of angry
white men who rose to power on pure punk politics. "Bipartisanship is
another term of date rape," says Grover Norquist, the Sid Vicious of the
GOP. "I don't want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the
size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub." The
boy has Oedipal problems and government is his daddy.
The party of Lincoln and Liberty was transmogrified into the party of
hairy-backed swamp developers and corporate shills, faith-based economists,
fundamentalist bullies with Bibles, Christians of convenience, freelance
racists, misanthropic frat boys, shrieking midgets of AM radio, tax cheats,
nihilists in golf pants, brownshirts in pinstripes, sweatshop tycoons,
hacks, fakirs, aggressive dorks, Lamborghini libertarians, people who
believe Neil Armstrong's moonwalk was filmed in Roswell, New Mexico, little
honkers out to diminish the rest of us, Newt's evil spawn and their
Etch-A-Sketch president, a dull and rigid man suspicious of the free flow of
information and of secular institutions, whose philosophy is a jumble of
badly sutured body parts trying to walk. Republicans: The No.1 reason the
rest of the world thinks we're deaf, dumb and dangerous.
Rich ironies abound! Lies pop up like toadstools in the forest! Wild swine
crowd round the public trough! Outrageous gerrymandering! Pocket lining on a
massive scale! Paid lobbyists sit in committee rooms and write legislation
to alleviate the suffering of billionaires! Hypocrisies shine like cat turds
in the moonlight! O Mark Twain, where art thou at this hour? Arise and
behold the Gilded Age reincarnated gaudier than ever, upholding great wealth
as the sure sign of Divine Grace.
Here in 2004, George W. Bush is running for reelection on a platform of
tragedy-the single greatest failure of national defense in our history, the
attacks of 9/11 in which 19 men with box cutters put this nation into a
tailspin, a failure the details of which the White House fought to keep
secret even as it ran the country into hock up to the hubcaps, thanks to
generous tax cuts for the well-fixed, hoping to lead us into a box canyon of
debt that will render government impotent, even as we engage in a war
against a small country that was undertaken for the president's personal
satisfaction but sold to the American public on the basis of brazen
misinformation, a war whose purpose is to distract us from an enormous
transfer of wealth taking place in this country, flowing upward, and the
deception is working beautifully.
The concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the few is the death
knell of democracy. No republic in the history of humanity has survived
this. The election of 2004 will say something about what happens to ours.
The omens are not good.
Our beloved land has been fogged with fear-fear, the greatest political
strategy ever. An ominous silence, distant sirens, a drumbeat of whispered
warnings and alarms to keep the public uneasy and silence the opposition.
And in a time of vague fear, you can appoint bullet-brained judges, strip
the bark off the Constitution, eviscerate federal regulatory agencies, bring
public education to a standstill, stupefy the press, lavish gorgeous tax
breaks on the rich.
There is a stink drifting through this election year. It isn't the Florida
recount or the Supreme Court decision. No, it's 9/11 that we keep coming
back to. It wasn't the "end of innocence," or a turning point in our
history, or a cosmic occurrence, it was an event, a lapse of security. And
patriotism shouldn't prevent people from asking hard questions of the man
who was purportedly in charge of national security at the time.
Whenever I think of those New Yorkers hurrying along Park Place or getting
off the No.1 Broadway local, hustling toward their office on the 90th floor,
the morning paper under their arms, I think of that non-reader George W.
Bush and how he hopes to exploit those people with a little economic uptick,
maybe the capture of Osama, cruise to victory in November and proceed to get
some serious nation-changing done in his second term.
This year, as in the past, Republicans will portray us Democrats as
embittered academics, desiccated Unitarians, whacked-out hippies and
communards, people who talk to telephone poles, the party of the Deadheads.
They will wave enormous flags and wow over and over the footage of firemen
in the wreckage of the World Trade Center and bodies being carried out and
they will lie about their economic policies with astonishing enthusiasm.
The Union is what needs defending this year. Government of Enron and by
Halliburton and for the Southern Baptists is not the same as what Lincoln
spoke of. This gang of Pithecanthropus Republicanii has humbugged us to
death on terrorism and tax cuts for the comfy and school prayer and flag
burning and claimed the right to know what books we read and to dump their
sewage upstream from the town and clear-cut the forests and gut the IRS and
mark up the constitution on behalf of intolerance and promote the corporate
takeover of the public airwaves and to hell with anybody who opposes them.
This is a great country, and it wasn't made so by angry people. We have a
sacred duty to bequeath it to our grandchildren in better shape than however
we found it. We have a long way to go and we're not getting any younger.
Dante said that the hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who in time
of crisis remain neutral, so I have spoken my piece, and thank you, dear
reader. It's a beautiful world, rain or shine, and there is more to life
than winning.

Hi all:

Just an update into the third installment of Ambit:

I've decided a standard journal (bound [stapled, saddle stitched, sewn, etc.[) was inappropriate for the layout of the third volume, whose theme is loosely based upon, but has a strong adherence to seriality. Instead I'm taking the 12 texts + bios and editorial statement and pressing 13 individual mini-mini chapbooks. I call it the 'autonomous anthology' since each work stands on its own as a 'book' of sorts but is part of a larger working text that is Ambit.

13 mini-minichapbooks sewn packaged in... not sure about details just yet but we should have about 30 copies available on October 7th when we read in NYC with David Kirschenbaum at the ACA gallery for his 'Small Non-NYC Press' gig. All artwork by Sarah Elizabeth Kirby, who will be producing twelve images for each booklet.

The contributors are as follows:

ed. Christophe Casamassima & Amy King
art+++ Sarah Elizabeth Kirby

Cynthis Sailers
Sheila E. Murphy
Laynie Brown
Tom Orange
Noah Eli Gordon
Charles Bernstein
Cole Swensen
Skip Fox
Matthew Klane
Monica de la Torre

w/ editor serials by

Amy King
Christophe Casamassima

+

bios and editorial

If you're in NYC get a copy early. If not, I'll send out info about the new v. soon.

For those in the Bay Area this Saturday, I'll be hosting an afternoon
of readings and performances by Michael Magee and Rodney Koeneke at my
place starting at 4pm. The last time I sent my address out on a public
distribution email my mailbox filled up with junk, so if you're
interested in coming and haven't been to visit me yet, just reply to
this email and I'll send directions. You might want to bring something
to nibble on or a drink.

MICHAEL MAGEE is the author of two books of poetry, MS (Spuyten Duyvil,
2003) and Morning Constitutional (Spencer Books/Handwritten Press,

Alabama Press, 2004). He edits the poetry journal Combo, as well as the
new Combo Books imprint.

RODNEY KOENEKE is the author of a book of poems, Rouge State (Pavement

Hi Taylor,

I'd like to come this Saturday and am pretty sure I'd be able to make it.
Would you be so good as to send me directions?  Thanks a million.

Hi All,

Michael Magee's hitting the San Francisco Bay Area this weekend like
some kind of reverse & vengeful Ivan--come out to see all the fuss:

FRIDAY, SEPT. 24 2004 @ 7:30 p.m.
Kevin Killian & Michael Magee
California College of the Arts
1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th &
Wisconsin) $5-$10, free to Small Press Traffic members

SATURDAY, SEPT. 25 2004 @ 4 p.m.
Rodney Koeneke & Michael Magee
Taylor Brady's house, Oakland
(email cartograffiti_at_mindspring_dot_com for directions)
NOTE: World Premiere of Magee's "Fascist Fairy Tales #6," starring
Stephanie Young as Margaret Thatcher & Taylor Brady as the inscrutable
"Sphinx"

MICHAEL MAGEE is the editor of Combo and the author of a new book, ms,
as well as the online project "My Angie Dickinson." His previous books
include Morning Constitutional and the new Emancipating Pragmatism:
Emerson, Jazz, and Experimental Writing, out this year from University
of Alabama Press.

To designate KEVIN KILLIAN a local legend is probably an understatement.
As a poet, novelist, critic, playwright, editor, and man about town,
Killian is a wonder and a force, devoted to scene and text. His many
books include Argento Series and Little Men and he is an editor of both
Mirage #4/Periodical and Krupskaya Books.

RODNEY KOENEKE is the author of two books: Rouge State (Pavement Saw,
2003) and a work of history on I.A. Richards in China. His current
manuscript, musee mechanique, reflects the rhythms and terrors of a
recent year spent working the gift shop inside San Francisco's Musee
Mechanique, a repository of disturbing fin de siecle arcade games.

I'd be grateful if someone could help me with a source. In _The Visible and
the Invisible_, Merleau-Ponty says he's quoting Valery with the following:

And in a sense . . . language is everything, since it is the voice of no
one, since it is the very voice of the things, the waves, and the forests.
(155)

Can anyone point me to the Valery source?

Thanks.

Featured Resources


Gertrude Stein's "Geogrpahy and Plays"
In an ongoing celebration of the roughly 100th anniversary of Gertrude Stein's Geography
and Plays, softpalate (www.softpalate.org) has matched various sound artists (audio
artists, performance artists, soundtext artists, composers, radio producers, soundpoets,
DJ's, re-mix artists, turntablists, etc.) with texts from Geography and Plays. Included
here are the first five plays as realized by Warren Burt, John Wanzel, Students from
Bella Vista Elementary School and David Braden, and Fadladder. (MP3)


"Artsounds"
Rare out-of-print double LP from 1985 of artists' recordings. Includes tracks by Larry
Rivers, Marcel Duchamp, Connie Beckley, Cotten/Prince, Minneko Grimmer, Philemona
Williamson, Jeff Gordon, Tony McAulay, Jonathan Borofsky, Les Levine, Burton Van Deusen,
Tom Wesslemann, Marcy Brafman, Philip Johnson, John Burgee, Italo Scanga, Thomas
Lanigan-Schmidt, Bob Gruen, Yura Adams, and Jennifer Bartlett. Includes extensive liner
notes. (MP3)


Stephen Vitiello "Collaborations and Unreleased MP3s"
Stephen Vitiello is a composer of electronic music and media artist. He works in mediums
ranging between installation, internet, video, film, dance and music for audio CD.
Presented here are rare pieces and collaborations with Pauline Oliveros, Joe McPhee, Tony
Conrad, Yasunao Tone and Scanner.


People Like Us "Abridged Too Far" (2004)
For the first time, UK-based People Like Us (Vicki Bennett) is releasing a new album
exclusively online here on UbuWeb. "Abridged Too Far" is a collection of audio work first
conceived through experimentation through or on radio. On this new collection, People
Like Us continues its pastiche of impressions of popular music from Europe and America
from the 1920s thru to 1990s. Vicki Bennett's work is an examination of the affect of
hearing well known tunes and lyrics in fragments, then putting those elements to play--
resonating, intermingling and recombining with the listeners own associations and shards
of memories. Full-color downloadable artwork and liner notes are available.


"The 365 Days Project"
UbuWeb is pleased to announce the re-launch and permanent home of curator Otis F. Odder's
365 Days Project. This legendary project, in which an MP3 a day -- of mostly outsider,
novelty, and oddball recordings -- was made available for the public to download over the
course of 2003. Briefly taken offline at the end of the project, it is now presented here
in its entirety, complete with images and vast commentary on each selection. The 365 Days
Project is part of UbuWeb's redesigned, newly-named and much expanded Outsiders section.


Stan Brakhage "The Brakhage Lectures" (1972)
Unavailable writings by filmmaker Stan Brakhage (1933-2003) who gave these lectures as a
credit course at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago during the fall and early
winter of 1970-71. Extended essays on George Méliès, David Wark Griffith, Carl Theodore
Dreyer, and Sergei Eisenstein. The original program included screenings of forty-three
films by Méliès, Griffith, Dreyer, Eisenstein, Cocteau and Edwin Porter. Includes an
introduction by Robert Creeley.


La Monte Young Marian Zazeela "Selected Writings"
(1959-1969) Long out-of-print seminal writings and interviews by Young and Zazeela. First
published by Heiner Friedrich in 1969 in an tiny edition. Includes "Notes On The
Continuous Periodic Composite Sound Waveform Environment Realizations Of "Map Of 49's

Tracery," "Dream House,"Conversation With La Monte Young By Richard Kostelanetz," The

For Camille --

That Valery quote comes from the poem "The Pythia" which is, I think, in
Charmes.


In the poem's final stanza:

Honor of Men, HOLY LANGUAGE,
Embellished discourse of prophecies,
Beautiful chains that trap
The god in distracted flesh,
Illumination, bounty!
Here speaks a Wisdom
And resonates that majestic Voice
That knows itself when it resounds
To be no more the voice of anyone
Than of the waves and the woods!


It is language itself (understood as a self-enclosed formal system) that
gives poetry its magical power!

Charm . . . carmen . . . "a magical song."

I hope this helps.  Merleau-Ponty may be paraphrasing.

Here is some information about each book:

About Devin Johnston's AVERSIONS,

Susan Howe comments that these poems are "uncannily precise responses of an
exacting lyric consciousness to the quotidian facts of experience.
Accurate, supernatural, unexpected turns connect without connectives, as if
by telepathic electricity."

Michael O'Brien writes that these poems "devote themselves to making
distinctions.
They take great care with cadence and music, but their art is, by
conviction, unobtrusive.... convincing, full of regard for the world."

****************************
About Martha Ronk's IN A LANDSCAPE OF HAVING TO REPEAT:

Ann Lauterbach comments that this poet "writes across, and through, the
invisible boundaries that condition our lives: past and present, dream and
waking,
intimacy and estrangement."

Bin Ramke writes that "[i]t is not so much Martha Ronk's voice as her vision
which has become so necessary insistent, persistent, passionate, engaging
simultaneously the familiar and the new."

************************
About Keith Waldrop's THE REAL SUBJECT, QUERIES AND CONJECTURES OF JACOB
DELAFON, WITH SAMPLE POEMS,

Robert Kelly writes "Waldrop's character, though named for a famous French
supplier of sanitary fixtures, seems tenderly American, readily taken aback
by ideas, a pilgrim of the literal."

Ben Marcus comments "a brilliantly sidewinding embrace of uncertainty, a
pulpit for arcane knowledge, and a cleverly constructed language filter
that keeps out everything but beauty and strangeness."

Marjorie Welish writes "Waldrop's poetic ear is as perfect as can be, his
rhetoric as thoughtful as possible, romantic ironies evanesce."

I've written
everything else
what will

why not
I've asked
everything else
wondered about
everything else,
I should say...
in THIS poem,
America's enemies
are sewn into the
emerging giraffes,
& who would
want to hurt
a giraffe? not
even the folks
who club baby
seals would lay
a finger
on a giraffe
Swinburne would
have, gleefully, but
no one's
seen him for
a while, I've
read he's dead

Landis Everson, Glyn Maxwell, Katia Kapovich, Ben Mazer, Philip
Nikolayev, Mark Lamoureux, John Hennessy

Landis Everson was an inner member of the Berkeley Renaissance of the
late 1940s, the fourth intimate of the famed Spicer-Duncan-Blaser
circle. To Jack Spicer he was a myth and a god. To Robert Duncan he was
the Poet King. John Ashbery admired his poetry in New York in the early
1950s, and published selections in Locus Solus in 1962 (Everson's last
appearance in print until now!). In 1960 Everson participated in a
pivotal three-person weekly Sunday poetry group with Spicer and Blaser
in San Francisco. While Spicer was writing Homage to Creeley, Everson
was composing Postcard from Eden and The Little Ghosts I Played With,
two great sequences which now appear in print for the first time in
Fulcrum 3, in The Berkeley Renaissance, edited by Ben Mazer. Fulcrum is
proud to present Landis Everson's first public appearances in over forty
years.

John Hennessy's poems have recently appeared or are forthcoming in
Fulcrum, The Sewanee Review, Salt, The Yale Review, LIT, and Ontario
Review. He teaches at UMass Amherst.

Katia Kapovich's collection of English language poetry is Gogol in Rome
(Salt, 2004). She is also a well-known Russian poet.

Mark Lamoureux's chapbooks are CITY/TEMPLE (Ugly Ducking Presse, 2003)
and 29 CHEESEBURGERS (Pressed Wafer, 2004).

Glyn Maxwell, born in Hertfordshire, England, now lives in NY City. His
several books of poetry include The Breakage and The Nerve (both
Houghton Mifflin). He is the poetry editor of The New Republic and
teaches at Princeton and Columbia.

Ben Mazer's chapbook selection of poetry, with cover art by Mary
Fabilli, is forthcoming from Fulcrum this fall. He is the editor of The
Berkeley Renaissance (Fulcrum, 2004) and The Collected Poems of John
Crowe Ransom (Handsel, 2005).

Philip Nikolayev's latest book of poetry is Monkey Time, 2001 Verse
Prize winner. His new collection is forthcoming from Salt.

Thanks a bunch, Gregory!

For Camille --

That Valery quote comes from the poem "The Pythia" which is, I think,
inCharmes.


In the poem's final stanza:

Honor of Men, HOLY LANGUAGE,
Embellished discourse of prophecies,
Beautiful chains that trap
The god in distracted flesh,
Illumination, bounty!
Here speaks a Wisdom
And resonates that majestic Voice
That knows itself when it resounds
To be no more the voice of anyone
Than of the waves and the woods!


It is language itself (understood as a self-enclosed formal system) that
gives poetry its magical power!

Charm . . . carmen . . . "a magical song."

I hope this helps.  Merleau-Ponty may be paraphrasing.

late 1940s, the fourth intimate of the famed Spicer-Duncan-Blaser
circle. To Jack Spicer he was a myth and a god. To Robert Duncan he was
the Poet King. John Ashbery admired his poetry in New York in the early
1950s, and published selections in Locus Solus in 1962 (Everson's last
appearance in print until now!). In 1960 Everson participated in a
pivotal three-poet weekly Sunday poetry group with Spicer and Blaser in
San Francisco. While Spicer was writing Homage to Creeley, Everson was
composing Postcard from Eden and The Little Ghosts I Played With, two
great sequences which now appear in print for the first time in Fulcrum

WRITING WORKSHOPS

=20
SURREALISM AND THE RADICAL IMAGINATION =AD=AD JANET HAMILL
Tuesdays at 7pm: 5 sessions begin October 12th
=B3Surrealism and the Radical Imagination=B2 will examine the complex nature of
imagination and its elements - illusionism, unreality, appearance, magic,
phantasm, fancy etc. - and the capacity of imagination to mediate between
the world of objective phenomena and subjective experience. The workshop
will look into the preoccupation of the Romanticists with imagination and
the sublime, the importance of the image to the Symbolists, and the
revolution brought about by the Surrealists to liberate poetic imagination
and take it to the realm of the marvelous.  Through means of Surrealist
games and methods, participants will be encouraged to cultivate their own
imaginations and enhance their imaginative writing skills.  A desire to
rescue poetry from some of its present unimaginative abuses is the only
requirement.

Janet Hamill has authored 4 books, most recently Lost Ceilings, a collectio=
n
of prose poems.  A second CD of words and music, in collaboration with the
band Moving Star, is slated for release in early 2005.


BRAINLINGO: WRITING THE VOICE OF THE BODY =AD=AD EDWIN TORRES
Tuesdays at 7pm: 5 sessions begin November 30
As artists we create our own communication, how we listen affects how we
speak, how we see our language affects how our voice is heard. Where the
senses meet each other is where poetry can begin. This workshop will be an
active creative laboratory that will explore how we communicate by
exercising the languages inside us. This is an active writing workshop
requiring a bottomless well and an open mind.

Edwin Torres=B9 books include The All-Union Day Of The Shock Worker, Fracture=
d
Humorous, I Hear Things People Haven=B9t Really Said, and his CDs
Holy Kid (Kill Rock Stars) and Novo (www.oozebap.org). He is co-editor of
Rattapallax and has a show on PS.1=B9s internet-radio station (www.wps1.org)
called LIVE NUDE RADIO THEATER.


WRITING IN THE STEPMOTHER TONGUE =AD=AD OZ SHELACH
Thursdays at 7pm: 10 sessions begin October 14th
Many of us today write in English without being at home. A disability? An
advantage? How and when to adapt, defy, write with an accent, subvert, merg=
e
in, stand out? We'll play games devised by and for non-native writers in
English; Read worldwide fiction; Use supportive criticism. I hope all of us
will come out with deeper confidence in making our writing effective by
drawing on the richness of our difference.

Oz Shelach moved to NY after working as a journalist in Israel (and writing
in Hebrew) for many years. His novel, Picnic Grounds, was published by City
Lights in 2003.

HAVING IT BOTH WAYS: THE PROSE POEM =AD=AD LARRY FAGIN
Fridays at 7pm: 10 sessions begin October 15th
A workshop designed for writers of both poetry and short prose (any genre),
who are interested in investigating the boundary between the two areas, or
those who have discovered such boundaries to be less than trustworthy. We
will read (Baudelaire, Stein, Ponge, Ashbery, Lydia Davis, Killarney Clary,
et al), exchange ideas (story, description, image, abstraction, the
personal), and refine our writing with an eye toward publication. Weekly
reading and writing assignments.

Larry Fagin edits Adventures in Poetry (books) and Sal Mimeo (magazine). He
teaches "experimental poetry" at New School University. Coma Rock, a prose
poem, will appear as a chapbook in Winter 2004.


ROCKS AND IDEAS =AD=AD RACHEL LEVITSKY
Saturdays at 12pm: 10 sessions begin October 16th
William Carlos Williams famously said, "--Say it, no ideas but in things--,=
=B2
a line which can be variously interpreted. In our virtual era, ideas and
things may a) be difficult to distinguish and b) have a tendency to morph
into each other.  Williams himself writes an introduction to his long poem
=B3Paterson,=B2 that explains the idea behind the long work. In this workshop w=
e
will experiment with things while having big fat ideas. We'll look at other
important modern and post modern works like Anne Waldman's Iovis, Harryette
Mullen's S*PeRM**K*T and Will Alexander's Asia and Haiti (and others) to
help us along.=20

Rachel Levitsky=B9s books include Under the Sun (Futurepoem, 2003) and the
chapbooks Cartographies of Error (Leroy, 1999) and Dearly, (a+bend, 1999).
She is the founder and co-curator of the Belladonna* Series in New York
City.

Something recently begun which threatens to be very long. Italics, bold type, subscripts and all are left out in the interest of
plain text. I'm not sure in this beginning stage of what might be a small book length piece what will  clear. I'd welcome tho'
any comments on the as so far. The poem includes collaborative assistance from Victoria Robinson.

And, self promotingly, all of "In Medias Res" in DaDaDa -- it is a

Hi all,

I realized I forgot to properly introduce our most recent additions to the
Boog Literature family.

In May I held a small apartment reading. For the event I published as a
flipbook Boog Reader 4: In Trouble by Betsy Andrews and C-Three by Bruce
Andrews, the two readers.

digest size, 20 pages, initial print run 50. $3 each, $4 ppd.

In July, for the Boston Poetry Massacre, I published Boog Reader 5: The
Kickboxer Suite by Erica Kaufman.

digest size, 12 pages, initial print run 26, signed and lettered. $5 each,
$6 ppd. Unsigned second run, $3 each, $4 ppd.

If you want one of each, $9 ppd. (with signed Kaufman), $7 ppd. (with
unsigned Kaufman).

Make checks payable (and post) to:

David Kirschenbaum

check out Lisa Jarnot's Some Other King of Mission.  Amen to the Humament.  Also, Ted Berrigan did a book from a blacked out western novel.  Can't remember the title, though.

Louis Zukofsky Centennial Conference
Columbia University / Barnard
September 17-18-19 - 2004

What follows are Elliptical Quotes from various speakers that found their
way into my  journal on Friday and Saturday. Occasionally you will see name=
s
assigned to quotes, often not. Charles Bernstein announced that many of the
Conference=B9s papers will be up on the U Penn website (of which I do not
immediately have the address(??)  =AD I am sure some of these quotes will be
much contradicted or limited =AD but this is more about =8Chearing the way
through=B9 =AD what initially resonated. Hopefully the process is -  more than
for me personally - publicly worthwhile.)
In case it makes use more convenient, I have placed this also on my blog
site.

without much dialog to follow had bloated whatever was ever left of my

abstraction had ironically taken me further and further away from the body
of Zukofsky=B9s actual work. I would have craved listening to good readers
periodically reciting actual sections of the work =AD that would have pleased
part of what was my original desire for a Centennial celebration of Z=B9s
language. The Conference did, however, provide time to meet many poets and
critics =AD familiar and new for which I was also very grateful. In the futur=

I would hope that such events would reconcile the impulses to hear the work=

Hi Mairead,

Ronald Johnson's RADI OS does this.  Erasures and obliterations
show up all over bp nichol's work as well.  Some of Susan Howe's
work too, like Eikon Basilika.  Michael Davidson's essay,
"Palimtexts: Postmodern Poetry and the Material Text" is worth
reading.

Also, with The Humument, with each edition some pages get
replaced with new versions/transformations, so there's a double
erasure going on.

And there's the issue of editing and rewriting, where older
"versions" of a poem are replaced by reworked newer "versions."
Auden was notorious for this.

A. Schwerner's "The Tablets" and K. Johnson's "Doubled Flowering" can be seen
as works of erasure.

Swedish text/sound poet =C5ke Hodell used the technique to strike out
whole lines of text in several of his books. For instance in his
Autobiography from 1967.

Well actually, I'm getting terrific answers and suggestions.  Murat's =
suggestion of "Doubled Flowering" really spins the thing.  What I was =
thinking of particulary was printed poetry that is actually erased or =
obliterated, i.e., the type itself is covered. Now that I write that, I =
think how a voice might be "stopped" or "stoppered" similarly when =
reading.  But yes, Chris, I suppose I was looking for references in this =
very material sense.
I have received plenty, and will compile a list to send to you all.  But =
what are you thinking? (notice=20
how this native of Ireland uses "but" not as an indication of an objection =
but as a sort of hamburger helper, a conversation extender!).  Anyway, =
what are you thinking?

juarez mud ruins and
i tried to resurrect this
crossing the river illegally for a better money land
http://www.asondheim.org/juarezmudruin.mov
there was a video but it was battering in the camera
back and forth furiously but these stills
came from the ruined video as if it were today or yesterday
it was ten years ago in juarez ten years ago in el paso
juarez was free and el paso was dangerous and furious
or el paso was free and dangerous, juarez furious
and they were crossing the river and there were empty lands
and we photographed the empty lands and looked into them
and into radiations and their routes of radiotelevision
so there's this and that this remnant
so there's this and that this remnant
we're the empire that made it happen
it's always like this and the sound is lost as well
someday i'll tell you a story
someday you'll listen to my confusion

*Rosalind is Born.*

*Rosalind,* an upstart new media art lexicon, has just been born
following a sheltered 9 month gestation.
http://www.furtherfield.org/gestation/

Feed Rosalind with your own words and definitions to express and declare
what you are, what you do and the worlds you create, on your own terms.

*Influence and mutate her, help her to maturity.*

*Your words may:-*
- describe something very particular to your life/experience/work &
net-based behaviour.
- be invented in a moment of desperation.
- arise in conversation or dialogue with others.
- already be in circulation yet not officially seen or accepted by new
media academics.

*What definitions will related to:*
Net art, new media, psychogeography, online performance, real-time
creativity, soft groups, new media writers, code geeks, net curators,
new media curators, relationalists, activists, networkers, networked
collecitves, net activism, social networks, net mutualists, net sufi's...

*Information about Rosalind's Gestation period
==================================*

*Rosalind began as GEST@TION*, a hidden project. This ensured that the
vocabulary was able to develop in a nurturing space unmediated and
consumed by outside sources and without interference or exploitation by
ruthless individuals or term-hungry institutions;-)

This project was concieved in January 2004 For 9 months the nascent
lexicon was fed with words and their definitions.
In early September 2004 we agreed a name for the lexicon- Rosalind-
after Rosalind Franklin
(http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Rosalind_Franklin.html) and
launched it to the world to be influenced, mutated and helped to
maturity by all who interact with it.

*The Gest@tors were:*
marc garrett, neil jenkins, ruth catlow, helen varley jamieson, karla
ptacek, andy deck, joseph & donna mcelroy, alan sondheim, ryan griffis,
michael szpakowski, patrick lichty, maya kalogera and alexandra reill.

Participants may wish to adopt new terms as they are added to the
lexicon. If so, the person who submits the term in question should embed
the definition that links to a web page on their own site, or a project
that they were involved with. The term can then be referenced in the
public location.

*GEST@TION is a Furtherfield project.*

Hi Mairead,

Randolph Healy has a pice in 'Scales' (i think) that does just this to
the UN Charter?
Sorry, i'm nowhere near a copy, but that's my memory.

There are also, erm, one or two pages in my 1980 book 'a present'
worked just this way. Also 'Speak Bitterness' by Forced Entertainment
in Language aLive vol 1

love and love

Hello again,
In light of reading this I might suggest (shamelesly) a sound piece of
mine at http://www.ubu.com/sound/hehir.html

it's the first one, How to Pick up a Ringing Phoneme. This is performance
of a text score that was produced through computer error. I was working
on an essay on phonaesthesia and sent a copy of a draft to a friend to
have a look at. Whe he printed it up certain letters were omitted in each
word. I tried to reproduce the  "stoppages" or gaps in the performance.

It can be considered a found poem and a formal constraint poem. Hewlett
Packard decided to erase all of the "S"s and "C"s and somewhat
arbitrarily (by chance, by gum) erased others. This in itelf may not be so
intersesting but the fact that the source text is about sound makes for
some (adjective) results.

I have it as a handy PDF if anyone is interested in seeing it.
cheers,
kevin

By definition any manner of writing constraint would require omissions
of one sort or another.

CALL FOR PAPERS: CONDEMNED MADONNAS

We would like to hear from women and men who would be interested in
sharing
their narrative stories or creative works for an edited text with a
working
title of Condemned Madonnas: A Collection of Narratives that Challenge
the
Ideology of Woman/Motherhood.

Condemned Madonnas is a collection of narratives, poetry, creative
non-fiction, and/or artwork that seeks to represent and reflect a broad
range of voices
in regards to challenges of stereotypical concepts of motherhood and
womanhood. We are just as open to considering personal stories
written-as-narrative as
we are to submissions informed by theoretical frameworks, such as the
relatively new genre of ficto-criticism or French feminist theory of the
body. The
drive of submissions, however, should reflect and relate the ways in
which
an
individual experience of womanhood or motherhood counters or challenges
conventional stereotypes.

Examples of material suited for this project might include the
following:
Women who have foregone motherhood, and the sense of ostracism they may
feel
in
regards to going against the stereotypical norm that "every woman wants
a
baby"; women who have voluntarily become non-custodial parents, yet
suffered
social
condemnation for "leaving the children"; women who have given up a child
for
adoption; mothers who have not had empty nest syndrome; women (married
or
single) who are having affairs with men (married or single) and
like/want it
that
way; women who are successful in a job that would be deemed by society
as
"men's work."

Importantly, however, we're open to a variety of perspectives,
experiences,
observations -- told in first-person narrative or, alternatively, poetry
or
artwork. The one defining aspect of submissions should be the ways in
which
"your" experience relates to and challenges the stereotypes of woman
and/or
motherhood. Contributors are welcome to request/nominate a pseudonym.

The publisher interested in reviewing chapters of Condemned Madonnas is
a
subsidiary of a major publishing house in New York.

In relation to length, we are hesitant to set limits - as undoubtedly
some
experiences will lend themselves to greater development and expression
than
others. Our submission deadline is December 30, although as we've been
fortunate
to receive a good number of proposals, we'd like to hear from interested
contributors sooner rather than later. Copyright on proposals and
submissions
remains with the individual contributor. Payment/royalty is an issue for
later
discussion in consultation with the editors and the publisher.



For those who would like to be part of this project, please forward a
brief
description of what you might consider submitting, along with your
contact
information, to the email address that follows.

mIEKAL's point did cross my mind when I first saw this thread. I also feel very cautious about the word 'erasure' as the last
century and this already have seen enough of that. It's a loaded word. I was struck too by the ambivalent nature of modernist,
post-modernist practice: in that the concentration on technique has a certain dehumanising feel and too that there's a certain
tendency towards 'deskilling' in the apparent application of mode over content so it can seem at times that many current practices
are weirdly parallel to global capitalism. It's not that I'm dissing the works mentioned nor am I suggesting that the writers are
covert agents of the Office Revolution, I'm sure they're not (!). But something that might be human seems to be possibly missing.

Now I feel faintly Luddite, which an interesting comparison to jump to mind. It's not that I'm against any of the techniques
mentioned, indeed, I can and have practised some of them myself, but somewhere in me is uneasy while too I feel constrained from
saying all that much for fear of falling into some kind of para-academic meta-language (see what I mean?!)

You may want to read Emmanuel Levinas' essay, "Transcending Words:

This Welcome Message updated 24 September 2004.

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list
carries about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time. A
good number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
(see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible.  We recognize that other lists
may sponsor other possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium.
We request that those participating in this forum keep in mind the
specialized and focused nature of this project, and respect our
decision to operate a moderated list. For subscription information or
to contact the moderators, write to <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

This is a private list and information about this list should not be
posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep the
list membership to those with specific rather than general interests,
and also to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume
manageable. The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day,
and two messages per subscriber per day.

The Poetics List is also a moderated list. Due to the high number of
subscribers, we no longer maintain the open format with which the list
began (at under 100 subscribers). The specific form of moderation that
we employ is a relatively fluid one: in most cases, messages are
reviewed after having been posted to the list, and difficulties
resolved on that basis; however, the list moderators may shift with
impunity between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list.
We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the spontaneity of
discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to these options, the
list moderators may place subscribers who find themselves unable to
abide by the rules of the list under individual review, in which case
only their messages would be received for moderators' approval before
being forwarded to the list; the list moderators may also ask
subscribers to leave the list if they are not productively
contributing to the discussion. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List (for further
information please see section 6 of this Welcome Message).

Please note, then, that our greatest concern is the flaming of  other
list subscribers, including the list owners, and/or the use of
false registration information.  The Poetics List exists to support
and encourage divergent points of view on Modern and contemporary
poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do what is necessary to
preserve this space for such dialog. For this reason, the list has
always been private or moderated.

Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers
and series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage
posts that announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5
for details.

---------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
All posts to the list should provide your full real name, as
registered. If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it
appears in the "from" line of the message header, please sign your
post at the bottom.  PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information
and correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
should include all of the required information. All other questions
about subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or
subscription policy, should be addressed to this same administrative
address.

PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION
REQUESTS.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the
list returned to us. If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to
request an increased quota from your system administrator.  You might
also consider obtaining a commercial account. In general, if a good
number of Poetics messages are bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this
happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting the moderators
at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------------------

3. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.  If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics digest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics nohtml index  --or--  set poetics html index

*to temporarily turn off Poetics mail send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with
no "subject": set poetics nomail

*to reactivate Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you
are going to be away for any extended period of time.  Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages but
other important mail.

-------------------------

4.  To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options) go to the
right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html  You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then return to your new address and contact the
moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> to resubscribe. If you find
that it is not possible to unsub using your old address, please
contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for assistance.

----------------------------

5.  Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in
this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
Feel free to query the list moderators if you are uncertain as to
whether a message is appropriate. All correspondence with the
moderators regarding submissions to the list remains confidential and
should be directed to us at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or
in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of
this list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always
welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

----------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We
define 'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or
personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes
ad hominem arguments in which the person rather than their work is
attacked; in other words while critique of a person's work is welcome
(critical inquiry is one of the main functions of the list), this
critique cannot extend to a critique or criticism of the person.

I think most would agree that the listserv serves as a productive
communal space for discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers
who do not follow listserv policy on flaming will first receive a
warning from the listserv moderator and should they fail to follow
policy again they will immediately be placed on review.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted
messages to the list. All messages intended for the Poetics List
should be sent in Text-Only format.

Please also do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post.  Messages containing attachments
will be presumed to be worm- or virus-carrying and will not be
forwarded to the list.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day

A self-interested plug for a knock-out photography exhibit at New York's
Japan Society of the work of Shomei Tomatsu - co-curated by Sandra Phillips
- my close friend and curator of photography at San Francisco's Museum of
Modern Art. The press release below spells out the particulars. It just
opened this past Monday (another good reason besides celebrating Louis
Zukofsky to be in New York). Briefly I would just say that Tomatsu's photos
navigate that territory between document and art(or poetry) and his trigger
seems to me right on the pulse of the geist of Japan in particular since th=
e
late fifties - USA occupation, Nagasaki residuals, prosperity et al. Under
the spell of the photographs - and without obvious melodrama -  a classic
sense of awe, compassion and restraint, an unfolding heartbreaker.

Main Gallery Exhibition
Shomei Tomatsu: Skin of the Nation
Through January 2, 2005
Shomei Tomatsu (b. 1930) is internationally recognized as the most
innovative and important photographer of Japan's postwar period. Bringing a=
n
objective, yet idiosyncratic eye to the fragmented reality of Japanese life
in the aftermath of World War II, Tomatsu's work examines postwar Japan's
ambivalent responses to Western cultural and political influences.
While representing a generation of artists who explored the complexities of
modern Japanese society, Tomatsu's achievement is unique. Starkly modernist
in his detached, abstract address of everyday objects, Tomatsu invests his
subjects with a mystery and poetry that suggest larger, deeper metaphors.
Skin of the Nation features nearly 260 works (drawn from the artist=B9s own
collection) spanning 50 years. Each of Tomatsu's major series is
represented, including Nagasaki 11:02, a historic documentation and
description of the lives of A-bomb survivors in Nagasaki.
Shomei Tomatsu: Skin of the Nation is organized by the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art in association with Japan Society, New York and is curated by
Sandra Phillips, Senior Curator of Photography at San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art, and photographer and writer Leo Rubinfien.
A major catalogue accompanies the exhibition, including essays by the
co-curators and John W. Dower, Professor of history at M.I.T. and author of
Embracing Defeat, a cultural history of postwar Japan that received the
Pulitzer and National Book awards in 2000. The book=B9s foreword is by
acclaimed Japanese photographer Daido Moriyama. Shomei Tomatsu: Skin of the
Nation is the first major English-language study of the work of this revere=
d
Japanese photographer. Published by Yale University Press, the catalogue is
available in cloth cover for $32 (Japan Society members), $45 (non-members)
at Japan Society Gallery or by calling (212) 715-1215, as well as at
traditional retail outlets. You may also print out a catalogue order form
online.=20

Not having seen her blog active in a long time, I had thought that the
person writing Baghdad Burning had managed to flee Iraq. Paradoxically (I
want her to survive this madness), I am grateful to see she is back in
action. I will say no more other than you can find her, as well, at

Liar, Liar...
I was channel-surfing yesterday evening- trying to find something
interesting to watch. I flipped vaguely to Al-Arabia and Bush's inane smile
suddenly flashed across the screen. Now, normally, as soon as I see his
face, I instantly change channels and try to find something that doesn't
make me quite as angry. This time, I stopped to watch as Allawi's pudgy
person came into view. It's always quite a scene- Bush with one of the
alledged leaders of the New Iraq.
I prepared myself for several minutes of nausea as Bush began speaking. He
irritates me like on one else can. Imagine long nails across a chalk board,
Styrofoam being rubbed in hands, shrieking babies, barking dogs, grinding
teeth, dripping faucets, honking horns =F1 all together, all at once =F1 and yo=
u
will imagine the impact his voice has on my ears.
I sat listening, trying not to focus too much on his face, but rather on th=
e
garbage he was reiterating for at least the thousandth time since the war. =
I
don't usually talk back to the television, but I really can't help myself
when Bush is onscreen. I sit there talking back to him- calling him a liar,
calling him an idiot, wondering how exactly he got so far and how they're
allowing him to run for re-election. E. sat next to me on the couch, peeved=
,
"Why are we even watching this?!" He made a jump for the remote control
(which I clutch to shake at the television to emphasize particular points)-
a brief struggle ensued and Riverbend came out victorious.
You know things are really going downhill in Iraq, when the Bush
speech-writers have to recycle his old speeches. Listening to him yesterday=
,
one might think he was simply copying and pasting bits and pieces from the
older stuff. My favorite part was when he claimed, "Electricity has been
restored above pre-war levels..." Even E. had to laugh at that one. A few
days ago, most of Baghdad was in the dark for over 24 hours and lately, on
our better days, we get about 12 hours of electricity. Bush got it wrong (o=
r
Allawi explained it to incorrectly)- the electricity is drastically less
than pre-war levels, but the electricity BILL is way above pre-war levels.
Congratulations Iraqis on THAT!! Our electricity bill was painful last
month. Before the war, Iraqis might pay an average of around 5,000 Iraqi
Dinars a month for electricity (the equivalent back then of $2.50) - summer
or winter. Now, it's quite common to get bills above 70,000 Iraqi Dinars...
for half-time electricity.
After Bush finished his piece about the glamorous changes in Iraq, Allawi
got his turn. I can't seem to decide what is worse- when Bush speaks in the
name of Iraqi people, or when Allawi does. Yesterday's speech was
particularly embarrassing. He stood there groveling in front of the
congress- thanking them for the war, the occupation and the thousands of
Iraqi lives lost... and he did it all on behalf of the Iraqi people. It was
infuriating and for maybe the hundredth time this year, I felt rage. Yet
another exile thanking the Bush administration for the catastrophe we're
trying to cope with. Our politicians are outside of the country 90% of the
time (by the way, if anyone has any news of our president Ghazi Ajeel Al
Yawir, do let us know- where was he last seen or heard?), the security
situation is a joke, the press are shutting down and pulling out and our
beloved exiles are painting rosey pictures for the American public- you
know- so everyone who voted for Bush can sleep at night.
Allawi actually said "thank you" nine times. Nine times. It really should
have been more- at least double that number of Iraqis died yesterday... and
about five times that number the day before. Looking back on the last month
alone, over 350 Iraqis have been killed either by American air strikes,
fighting, or bombs... only 9 thank yous?
The elections are already a standard joke. There's talk of holding election=
s
only in certain places where it will be 'safe' to hold them. One wonders
what exactly comprises 'safe' in Iraq today. Does 'safe' mean the provinces
that are seeing fewer attacks on American troops? Or does 'safe' mean the
areas where the abduction of foreigners isn't occurring? Or could 'safe'
mean the areas that *won't* vote for an Islamic republic and *will* vote fo=
r
Allawi? Who will be allowed to choose these places? Right now, Baghdad is
quite unsafe. We see daily abductions, killings, bombings and Al-Sadr City,
slums of Baghdad, see air strikes... will they hold elections in Baghdad?
Imagine, Bush being allowed to hold elections in 'safe' areas- like Texas
and Florida.=20
The hostage situations are terrible. Everyone is wondering and conjecturing
about the Italian hostages. Are they really dead? Is it possible? Seeing th=
e
family of the British hostage on TV is quite painful. I wonder if they'll
forever hate Iraqis after this. I saw the plea the made on CNN, asking the
abductors to be merciful. Dozens of Iraqis are abducted daily and no one
really knows who is behind it. Some blame it on certain Islamic groups,
others on certain political groups- like Chalabi's, for example. It's hardl=
y
shocking, considering our own PM, Allawi, was, by his own admission,
responsible for bombings and assassinations inside of Iraq- there is some
interesting information here.
For those who haven't read it, you really should. Juan Cole's "If America
were Iraq, What would it be Like?".

Fahrenheit 9/11...
August was a hellish month. The heat was incredible. No one remembers
Baghdad ever being quite this hot- I think we broke a new record somewhere
in mid-August.
The last few days, Baghdad has been echoing with explosions. We woke up to
several loud blasts a few days ago. The sound has become all too common.
It=B9s like the heat, the flies, the carcasses of buildings, the broken
streets and the haphazard walls coming up out of nowhere all over the city=8A
it has become a part of life. We were sleeping on the roof around three day=
s
ago, but I had stumbled back indoors at around 5 am when the electricity
returned and was asleep under the cool air of an air-conditioner when the
first explosions rang out.
I tried futilely to cling to the last fragments of a fading dream and go
back to sleep when several more explosions followed. Upon getting
downstairs, I found E. flipping through the news channels, trying to find
out what was going on. =B3They aren=B9t nearly fast enough,=B2 he shook his head
with disgust. =B3We=B9re not going to know what=B9s happening until noon.=B2
But the news began coming in much sooner. There were clashes between armed
Iraqis and the Americans on Haifa Street- a burned out hummer, some
celebrating crowds, missiles from helicopters, a journalist dead, dozens of
Iraqis wounded, and several others dead. The road leading to the airport ha=
s
seen some action these last few days- more attacks on troops and also some
attacks on Iraqi guard. The people in the areas surrounding the airport
claim that no one got any sleep the whole night.
The areas outside of Baghdad aren=B9t much better off. The south is still
seeing clashes between the Sadir militia and troops. Areas to the north of
Baghdad are being bombed and attacked daily. Ramadi was very recently under
attack and they say that they aren=B9t allowing the wounded out of the city.
Tel Affar in the north of the country is under siege and Falloojeh is still
being bombed.
Everyone is simply tired in Baghdad. We=B9ve become one of those places you
read about in the news and shake your head thinking, =B3What=B9s this world
coming to?=B2 Kidnappings. Bombings. Armed militias. Extremists. Drugs. Gangs=
.
Robberies. You name it, and we can probably tell you several interesting
stories.
So how did I spend my 9/11? I watched Michael Moore=B9s movie, Fahrenheit
9/11. I=B9ve had bootleg CD version since early August. (Grave apologies to
Michael Moore- but there=B9s no other way we can see it here=8A) The copy has
been sitting in a drawer with a bunch of other CDs. One of my cousins
brought it over one day and said that while it was brilliant, it was also
quite depressing and distressing all at once. I had been avoiding it
because, quite frankly, I cannot stand to see Bush for five minutes
straight- I wasn=B9t sure how I=B9d cope with almost two hours.
Three days ago, I took it out while the house was relatively quiet- no
cousins, no cousins=B9 children, parents busy watching something or another,
and E. asleep in front of the air conditioner for the next three hours.
The CD was surprisingly clear. I had expected some fuzziness and bad sound
quality- it was fine. Someone had made the copy inside a movie theater. I
could tell because in the background, there was a ringing mobile phone a
couple of times and some annoying person in the front kept getting up to
adjust his seat.
I was caught up in the film from the first moment, until the very last.
There were moments, while watching, when I could barely breathe. I wasn=B9t
surprised with anything- there was nothing that shocked me- all of the stuf=
f
about the Bush family and their Saudi friends was old news. It was the othe=
r
stuff that had an impact- seeing the reactions of Americans to the war,
seeing the troops in Iraq being interviewed, seeing that American mother
before and after she lost her son in Iraq.
Ah, that mother. How she made me angry in the beginning. I couldn=B9t stand t=
o
see her on screen- convincing the world that joining the army was the ideal
thing to do- perfectly happy that her daughter and son were =8Cserving=B9
America- nay, serving, in fact, the world by joining up. I hated her even
more as they showed the Iraqi victims- the burning buildings, the
explosions, the corpses- the dead and the dying. I wanted to hate her
throughout the whole film because she embodied the arrogance and ignorance
of the people who supported the war.
I can=B9t explain the feelings I had towards her. I pitied her because,
apparently, she knew very little about what she was sending her kids into. =
I
was angry with her because she really didn=B9t want to know what she was
sending her children to do. In the end, all of those feelings crumbled away
as she read the last letter from her deceased son. I began feeling a
sympathy I really didn=B9t want to feel, and as she was walking in the street=
s
of Washington, looking at the protestors and crying, it struck me that the
Americans around her would never understand her anguish. The irony of the
situation is that the one place in the world she would ever find empathy wa=
s
Iraq. We understand. We know what it=B9s like to lose family and friends to
war- to know that their final moments weren=B9t peaceful ones=8A that they
probably died thirsty and in pain=8A that they weren=B9t surrounded by loved
ones while taking their final breath.
When she asked why her son had been taken and that he had been a good
person=8A why did this have to happen to him? I kept wondering if she ever
gave a second thought to the Iraqi victims and whether it ever occurred to
her that Iraqi parents perhaps have the same thoughts as the try to dig
their children out from under the rubble of fallen homes in Falloojeh, or a=
s
they attempt to stop the blood flowing out of a gaping hole in the chest of
a child in Karbala.
The flashes of the bombing of Iraq and the victims were more painful than I
thought they would be. We lived through it, but seeing it on a screen is
still a torment. I thought that this last year and a half had somehow made
me a little bit tougher when it came to seeing Iraq being torn apart by
bombs and watching foreign troops destroy the country- but the wound is
still as raw as ever. Watching those scenes was like poking at a gash with
sharp stick- it hurt.
All in all, the film was=8A what is the right word for it? Great? Amazing?
Fantastic? No. It made me furious, it made me sad and I cried more than I=B9d
like to admit=8A but it was brilliant. The words he used to narrate were
simple and to the point. I wish everyone could see the film. I know I'll be
getting dozens of emails from enraged Americans telling me that so-and-so
statement was exaggerated, etc. But it really doesn't matter to me. What
matters is the underlying message of the film- things aren't better for
Americans now than they were in 2001, and they certainly aren't better for
Iraqis.
Three years ago, Iraq wasn't a threat to America. Today it is. Since March
2003, over 1000 Americans have died inside of Iraq... and the number is
rising. In twenty years time, upon looking back, how do Americans think
Iraqis are going to remember this occupation?
I constantly wonder, three years after 9/11, do Americans feel safer? When
it first happened, there was a sort of collective shock in Iraq. In 2002,
there was a sort of pity and understanding- we=B9ve been through the same.
Americans could hardly believe what had happened, but the American
government brings this sort of grief upon nations annually=8A suddenly the wa=
r
wasn=B9t thousands of kilometers away, it was home.
How do we feel about it this year? A little bit tired.
We have 9/11=B9s on a monthly basis. Each and every Iraqi person who dies wit=
h
a bullet, a missile, a grenade, under torture, accidentally- they all have
families and friends and people who care. The number of Iraqis dead since
March 2003 is by now at least eight times the number of people who died in
the World Trade Center. They had their last words, and their last thoughts
as their worlds came down around them, too. I=B9ve attended more wakes and
funerals this last year, than I=B9ve attended my whole life. The process of
mourning and the hollow words of comfort have become much too familiar and
automatic.
September 11=8A he sat there, reading the paper. As he reached out for the cu=
p
in front of him for a sip of tea, he could vaguely hear the sound of an
airplane overhead. It was a bright, fresh day and there was much he had to

No.

I believe many of us on this list are using the technique of word (or

Sorry, cris, 'david.bircumshaw' didn't write that, it's mIEKAL (omitted and erased!) you quote.

I did say that mIEKAL's point had crossed my mind when I first saw the thread.  As for your point,
h'm, I'd say writing +can+ involve etc. I certainly couldn't agree that ALL writing involves
editing and recontextualisation (ugh, ugly management-speaky kind of word, don't like, nasty!).
I haven't any objection to either process but can only end up with a statement like:

'writing may or may not involve editing and that other word' which isn't really worth saying
anyhow. What I'm interested in is what people are using tactics of 'omission and erasure' for,
I'd like to know more about the raison d'être of the undoubtedly interesting US works that
have been mentioned most of which I do have access to. I know why I use 'recontext' (God,
I dislike that word so much I can't even finish it) when I use the tactic but it'd be interesting
to know what the why of it is elsewhere. Without jargon, anyone, please.

Would the late Armand Schwerner's masterwork "The Tablets" qualify as work o=
f=20
omission?  Here's a description taken from a google reference:
Armand Schwerner has been =E2=80=9Creconstructing=E2=80=9D these fictional S=
umero-Akkadian=20
inscriptions, apparently from the time of The Epic of Gilgamesh, since 1968.=

and hieroglyphics speak eloquently, and Schwerner takes full advantage of th=
e=20
liberty provided by =E2=80=9Cindecipherable and untranslatable=E2=80=9D pass=

include notes from a rather pedantic and often hilarious scholar-translator.
Schwerner's "gaps" are brilliantly eloquent.

I think the question was about visible omissions or erasures functioning as
a part of the structure and texture of the poem.

Correction to my last - I meant to write:

>I'd like to know more about the raison d'être of the undoubtedly interesting US works that
have been mentioned most of which I do NOT have access to<

Oh the joys of omission!!!

Otherwise I'd emphasise it is the why of a particular formal tactic interests me - it applies across the board - why a sonnet here,
a parody there etc etc.
I notice Charlotte Mandel's post on 'The Tablets' which, altho' I don't know the work, certainly conveys some sense of why omission
is a resource in the poem. What does worry or dis-ease me is technique, technik, being seen as an end to and in itself. I relate
that in some ways to modern capitalist practice, and back to that side of High Modernism that emphasised surface and had a
distinctly anti-human bias. The high-rises were the bastard spawn of the Bauhaus after all. The Modern Office is a monument to
Innovative Capital. The language of theory can seem unsettlingly like dialects of management. The impenetrable groves of Progress.

There are a number of issues here - first of all, what constitutes
omission and erasure? Does Furnival or Houedard qualify? What about
Derrida/Heidegger? My own work has repeatedly used omission - for example
the eliminate.pl script that Florian Cramer wrote for me. There's
Rauschenberg. Don't forget Brainard. Probably all of the concrete poets
touched on this one way or another. Does occlusion qualify? Decoupage?
Missed lines as in a piece by John Clare? Gaps in Gilgamesh?
Reconstitutions in Tutenkhamon as building blocks were reused as
deliberate effacement? Japanese grass calligraphy with strokes eliminated
or reduced? Does intention have to play a role? What about the library of
Alexandria, the burning and looting of the library in Baghdad? The absence
of pronunciation in Yhvh? The deliberate slant to Adoshem in secular
literature? The silencing and/or breaking of the strings of the ch'in in
classical Chinese music lore? And so forth.

This should probably be forwarded as I'm almost unread here. - Alan

Suicidal Thoughts


Last night watched American Splendor about Harvey Pekar and was struck
with uselessness. My domain name was renewed in the nick of time. Kerry is
behind by nine points as state after state swings towards the fascists,
with the so-called electoral vote 28 points ahead for Bush Inc. I had a
growth removed from my face being tested for malignancy. I've gone off
lexapro and feel dizzy pretty much all the time but so far nothing else.
The horror of beheadings as we're "winning in Iraq." I don't sleep
anymore. I can't lose weight. So much net art is rehashed conceptualism
from the 60s and 70s. Doesn't the country _get it_? No one replies to my
work at all, at this point. Discussion on Poetics about "erasure."
Argentina? I've used the technique at least since 1976 in those poetics
programs I wrote. A fourth hurricane heading for Florida and people still
develop the Everglades, now at 9% what it was. The roof of this building
is cracked and we'll have to move out for a while when it's replaced.
Boojum, our cat, is checked now daily for a resurgence of cancer; we can't
tell. The crazy guy on our block now has a pit bull. More trees are dying
and more pit bulls are sprouting. Our friends had to get rid of their
rooftop garden because of an "error." Sharona's leaving Monk because of
"creative differences" or some such. It's getting harder to breathe around
here. Whatever Bush says, goes. We're really broke at this point and as
usual I feel at odds and somewhat alienated from most of my family. At
sixty-one the body begins to whisper failure. I'm absolutely certain there
is no god, spirit, soul, though I was destined to believe otherwise. Every
organized religion murders. On one level, the murders of Russian children
are inconceivable; on the other, they're part of the daily routine. First
the mudslides and floods, then the drowning, then the looting and fury.
Get rid of your vegetation and everything sinks in the sea. Human animals
are by far the filthiest; look at the New York subway stations. TV Guide
no longer lists late late night at all. Every day there are new scams in
the email, targeting the weakest among us. Most of these are completely
illegal. Reality shows along the line of Survivor seem to delight in
animal-torture; where is Peta? Even the SPCA? During the Republican
convention here, half a million took to the streets, and there were online
and other offline actions as well. The result, a fascist popularity
landslide. Medication is pricing the elderly out of existence. Another
Ramone died. Madonna's Kabbalah is idiotic and insulting. I've been
sleeping far too much as a result of depression; getting off the lexapro
should help. A psychiatrist friend suggested I use "bubblegum" as a
mantra. SUV usage has gone up 45% in most places here and I gather the
Hummer gets 7 miles to the gallon. Our place is overrun with mice who
freely eat from our humane traps. The cat watches. There are some flies as
well. I'm not playing enough music and have somewhat lost my embrochure.
I'm hopefully selling some rare books to raise some money as my father
yells at me that they're not worth much. The dark night of the soul is 3
p.m. in the afternoon. Someday I'll be thrown in the jail for disbelief.
It's increasingly hard to work on texts in absolute silence. My friends
are all in academics; I sit here at the desk and hunger for a living. I
still haven't gotten over the death of my mother and my father's dislike
of me. We're living on Azure's school loans and my occasional work or
lecturing. My headaches have increased in frequency and severity over the
past several months. How can anyone claim Afghanistan or Iraq are
successes? This is no longer my country and the net is no longer "my" net;
both belong to the spammers. Frances, Ivan, Charley, Jeanne. Our
neighborhood is being redeveloped and across Flatbush, buildings will be
seized by "eminent domain." I head someone else leaped from a building at
NYU, Azure's university. My Sony Hi8 with PCM sound won't sync tapes
properly and I'm in danger of losing another ten years' work. The
Susquehanna river in Pennsylvania, where my father lives, rose to within
three feet of overflowing the dikes. I get tired of arguments about
cross-posting, but on the other hand, am almost never invited to read. I
get tired of arguments about "avant-garde" and "experimental" writing,
when clearly something new is happening and people are too blind to see
it. Was it Louisiana that just approved of a state-constitutional ban on
same-sex marriages? For the first time in decades, we're insisting on the
instituting of privilege and prejudice. Full-fledged legal racism and
anti-semitism are not far behind. This country is white, right-wing,
Christian, and by God, patriotic; don't let anyone tell you different. I'm
more afraid of Bush than Ben Laden. Who wants to hear a 61-year-old
guitar/shamisen player anyway? Let's watch Jerusalem burn. I'm worried the
mice will eat the bellows of the pump organ. I feel death breathing down
my back, illuminating the pain in my early-morning eyes. Why isn't there
terrorism directed at the fascists in power? I worry my friends won't be
able to tolerate me. We can't keep dust out of this place and live in
constant allergic reaction. My astigmatic eyes have trouble focusing
properly and if I don't consciously correct, my digital photographs come
out at a 3-degree tilt. About twice a month I have to call 911 for the
neighborhood. The sink pipes blew out a couple of weeks ago. We're in
incredible debt, for the first time in our lives. A saving grace would be
a hard cold winter.

Hi Alan,

on another list I quoted your work within the same thread, I even
suggested that the _signs_ you sometimes use could be interpreted as
_silenced words_.

As you can see, you are not unread, even if I realize I should take a
Sabbatical year to read all what you wrote,

take care,

And thus I also think of visible omissions/erasures as a form on
the other side of collage, informing that process in the way
negative space informs space.

Dear All,
        This is my first e-mail to the list.  I've read some interesting Julia Kristeva on poetic language being a way to resolve the old dichotomy between art and political commitment.  She looks at the moment in history (early to mid 1930s, I think) when Surrealism and Socialist ideas came together (though she doesn't actually specify this, I'm assuming it's what she meant) through the Surrealist Manifesto which Trotsky had asked for and which came from Andre Breton (and others?) and talked about a kind of collective which lay in the unconscious anyways, and which led to a belief in a kind of communalism, if not socialism.   She specifies poetic language as being the route through which political commitment can be made, though she doesn't really say whether this has to be intentional or not.  I forget which book this came out of, as I read it kinda on the fly when I had about a half an hour to kill at the B.U. library.  I can go back and find it, however...   This is a long
 -winded way of my saying that this is a research interest of mine - anybody else out there dealing with similar questions?   Have any leads?  Anyways, I've heard this list is a great resource so thank-you all for letting me join.
Sincerely,
        Sarah Pearlstein

Anachronisms, excrescences, said too much, said all the time,

[Spoken at Tomsk State University's Faculty of Philosophy, IX.17.2004]:

Art is entering the time of the injunction, as assertions of ideology
can hardly be posed without posing the problem of the representation and
proposing boundaries, limits, thresholds of tolerance. Nothing,
especially art, is said to be outside the claims to truth made by the
declarative definitions of the ideological position, and for those who
practice one or another of the many forms of art, discussions about the
boundaries of the representation are disturbing as they most often take
place from positions of power far from the boundaries, the margins, all
the manifold variables that comprise the social environment and
individual volition of the artist and the volatile energies charged in
the making of the work of art. The discourse of culture, whether it
calls itself film theory, art history, or literary criticism, needs an
object against which its own identity can be constituted and its project
of the narration of historical structures authenticated. This object,
the artwork, thus interpreted, is mobilized in the interest of one or
another claim to truth, and the terms of its activation as such, when
these terms involve the suppression of the materiality of the artwork,
need continually to be carefully considered.

The concept of culture is invoked whenever what is good or bad,
progressive or backwards, valuable or worthless about the artwork is
discussed. Censorship does not need to be actively imposed by a
government for institutional validation to be required in conferring
value, and this is where the discourse of culture is hardly unmotivated,
depending on the parameters of this discourse, and the interests served
by it. Without attention to the politics of cultural interpretation, the
integrity of the category of the political is itself threatened, and
political philosophy is worth defending in a time of intensifying
territorial and predatory wars and the revival of ethnic and state
nationalisms without which one country cannot make war against another,
nor suppress internal opposition. Attention to the materiality of the
artwork, which in the sphere of the cinema would include "avant-garde
practices which foreground frame, surface, montage, and other cinematic
codes or materials, including sound, flicker, and special effects,"
(qtd. in Byg 166) participates in this defense by challenging
abstractions that reduce the artwork to the condition of formula and
function among assignments of usefulness and value. The ontology of the
work of art, its very being, develops from its passage through
contemporary and imminent sites of production, or what used to be called
the influence of the work of art on future generations of artists. For
Walter Benjamin, in a fragment written in 1920, "Kandinsky expresses
this by saying that the permanent value of works of art appears more
vividly to later generations, since they are less receptive toward their
contemporary value" ("The Medium through Which Works of Art Continue to
Influence Later Ages" 235).

The formal question, the technical question, the material question of
the single take in Alexander Sokurov's Russian Ark, alternately
characterized in the discussion of this film published in Art Margins,
www.artmargins.com, an online journal in English dedicated to
contemporary visual arts in Eastern Europe and Russia, as an eye that
does not blink, an innovation that makes film history as the longest
shot in the history of the medium, a director's decision which demanded
of its photographer the physical ability to carry the heavy camera
equipment on his back, referred to by one writer as "the
self-mortification of the photographer" and as a device without a
future, a "stunt," a one-shot deal (Eshelman). Mention is also made of
public disagreement expressed by the director over an award given to the
photographer, a difference further sharpened by the national identities
attributed to Sokurov and Tilman Buettner, one Russian and the other
German.

The emphasis on this attribution is all the more surprising if it is
remembered that the cinema itself arrives in modern times as the art
form that transcends, or collapses, depending on the point of view, the
national boundaries of culture and the reliance of these boundaries on
the specificity of language. Subtitles are secondary to the image. The
Yiddish Theater described in Kafka's Diaries at about the same time as
the last Grand Ball at the Winter Palace in 1913, the culminating scene
in Russian Ark, might be offered in contrast as one example of a nearly
self-contained sphere of signs and gestures. What one of the writers for
Art Margins calls the "diegetic time" of the film, which "traverses the
entire epoch of Petrine reforms, from the early 18th century, to its end
in 1913" (Kujundzic), another writer might view from the perspective of
the gap separating the content and form of the narrative that stages an
image of the aristocracy, the monarchy, and the officer corps of an
imperial army surrounded by great paintings. "How can one see history?"
Dragan Kujundzic asks, following the direction of the opening line
spoken by the narrator, "I open my eyes and see nothing ['Orkryvaiu
glaza i nichego ne vizhu'].

To add to the list: Ronald Johnson's RadiOs.  After coming across a copy
of this interesting book In 1980, I began a series of poems
deconstructed from John George Hohman's Book of Pow Wows, Or Man's
Long-Lost Friend (1820), a collection of folk magic and remedies popular
among the Pennsylvania Germans.  I called this series of erasures Man's
Wows, and a selection was published by Charles Alexander under his Black
Mesa Press imprint.  A new, up-dated Man's Wows is available online at
the Duration website.  In addition, two more examples of my erasure
texts are in the latest Eratio, Postmodern Poetry.  It's about 4 a.m.
here in the land of the not-yet-risen Rising Sun. Everyone's asleep in
the apartment.  Too early to drink coffee, and too late to think it's

Mairead,
The first thing that came to mind is Nota by Martin
Corless-Smith.
Coincidentally, as I am researching this book, I
stumbled across this listserv and asked to join.  A
posting last year discussed whether or not Thomas
Swan, a putative poet of the 17th century in Nota, in
fact existed or was manufactured by the author (it
seems this was a manufactured identity, by the way).
This is my first posting here.  I am completing my MFA
at the University of Utah and hopefully will begin my
doctoral work next fall.

serendipitously I just got a notice about a (local to me) conference
about identity in the 17th century:

http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/c1718cs/calendar.htm

Imposters:
Identity and Pretense in Europe and the Atlantic World, 1600-1800
arranged by
Margaret C. Jacob, UCLA
Mary Lindemann, University of Miami
Jeffrey S. Ravel, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

The topic of imposture in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is
one that is ripe for examination in a cross-cultural, transnational
perspective. While the adventures of Giacomo Casanova or the Chevalier
d'Eon were well known at the time and remain notorious today, they offer
but two examples of the many forms of imposture by individuals and
groups that occurred throughout Europe and the Atlantic world between
1600 and 1800. This program will address several questions, including:
What distinguished imposture in this period from that which took place
before and after in the West? How do imposters at this time differ from
"aventuriers" or those who engage in masquerade, or from the temporary
slippage of identities on stage? Is there a shift from group imposture
in the seventeenth century (motivated primarily by religious
intolerance) to individual imposture in the eighteenth century
(encouraged by new financial and commercial possibilities)? Does
institutional change, as much as political and cultural discourse,
account for new and changing opportunities to counterfeit identity? Is
the nature of imposture different in the colonies than in the metropole?
And, finally, how might such a broad-based inquiry into imposture
address scholarship on the nature of "identity" and "self" in the West?

All best,
Catherine Daly

I Can't Even Give it Away (Singer with Piano)
http://derekrogerson.com/sounds/cantaway.mp3


I've had it since I was a little girl.
I was taught to prize it a lot!
But (since I'm grown), I'm finding out
it really isn't so hot.

They told me that I'd kept it long enough.
They said, "Aww... don't be silly about it!
Because if you really want to dress yourself
you'd be much better off without it.

In this modern generation
girls don't keep them anymore!
Why, it's rare to find a girl with one
if she is over four!"

 (oh well)

I never have been over-hasty.
I always have needed a shove.
I thought maybe I could bare giving it up
-- if someone would treat it with love!

But would you believe it? There wasn't a taker!
From Boot back to Candlestick-Maker!
Maybe I had no Art? (The approach wasn't smart.)
And -- then! I decided to sell it.

But I couldn't even give it away!
I'd swear I'd never thought I'd see that day!
No one would have it for love or money!
And (up to that time) I thought it was a honey!

It's funny how those things do change.
Why someone even told me,
"Don't be still. That thing won't last you!"
Then -- did I get mad.

I said, "My mother had one!
And, Grandmother had one!
And, I know theirs were played on!"
Now don't tell me the times have changed that much.

But I guess I'll have to go on
playing it myself...
'cause I couldn't even give it away...

(woe! ho!)

The way it is -- that's how it's going to stay!
Nothing went the way I planned!
I guess I'll never have a baby grand!
I'm stuck with my upright piano!

  “Few writers have as sure a lyrical sense of places and their people as

fiction writer Nami Mun on Tuesday September 28, 2004 at 8:00 PM. For New
Works/New Voices, Intersection has invited some of the Bay Area’s most
influential writers to read new work and to select a writer whom they feel
is deserving of greater attention and exposure.

  Previous New Works/New Voices readings have featured Thom Gunn with Jim
Powell, Cherrie Moraga with Reid Gomez, Barry Gifford with Juvenal Acosta,
Diane di Prima with Susan Thackrey, and Gary Snyder with Amy Wu Wong. This
unique pairing will provide the public with the opportunity to hear new work
from a literary icon and a chance to acquaint themselves with the work of an
exciting, emerging fiction writer. Admission is $5 - $15 sliding scale.

  JAMES D. HOUSTON is the author of seven novels, including the trilogy,
Continental Drift (Alfred Knopf, 1978), Love Life (Alfred Knopf, 1985), and
The Last Paradise (University of Oklahoma Press, 1998), which received the
American Book Award in 1999. His recent novel, Snow Mountain Passage (Alfred
Knopf, 2001), described in The Washington Post as “a dignified, powerful
narrative of our shared American destiny," was cited by The Post, The San
Francisco Chronicle, and The Los Angeles Times as one of the Year's Best
Books. Among his several nonfiction works is Farewell To Manzanar (Houghton
Mifflin, 1973), co-authored with his wife, Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston. A true
account of her family's experience during and after the WWII internment, it
is in a 65th printing from Bantam Books and a standard work in schools and
colleges across the country. Houston was born in San Francisco, where his
parents settled after migrating west from Texas during the Depression of the
l930s. In l959 his first published story appeared in the London literary
journal, Gemini. Another early effort won that year's U.S. Air Force Short
Story Contest. After extensive travel in Europe - to Belgium, France,
Germany, Spain, Scotland, Scandinavia, and the Soviet Union - he returned
home to pursue an M.A. in American Literature at Stanford. He studied with
Wallace Stegner, critic Irving Howe, editor Malcolm Cowley, and the Irish
short story master, Frank O'Connor. Four years later he returned to Stanford
as a Stegner Writing Fellow. While there he sold his first novel to Dial
Press, and completed his second, Gig, which won the Joseph Henry Jackson
Award for Fiction in 1967. Since 1962 he and Jeanne have lived in Santa
Cruz. For several years he made his living as a musician, teaching classical
and folk guitar, and playing acoustic bass in a piano bar and in a bluegrass
band. In l969, after teaching for a year at Stanford, he began teaching
writing part-time at the University of California's Santa Cruz campus, an
arrangement that continued for over twenty years, interspersed with visits
to the University of Hawaii, University of Oregon, University of Michigan,
and George Mason University. A frequent visitor to Hawaii, he has traveled
widely in the Pacific Basin, thanks in part to grants in the l980s from the
U.S.I.S. Arts America program, which took him to South Korea, Japan, the
Phillipines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. In 1998 he served as a
Smithsonian Lecturer for the Cunard Lines' South Pacific Cruise to the
Marquesas, Fakarava, Tahiti, Tonga and Fiji. His often anthologized stories
and essays have appeared in such publications as The New York Times, The New
Yorker, Rolling Stone, GQ, Ploughshares, The Utne Reader, The Los Angeles
Times Sunday Magazine, Honolulu, Manoa: A Pacific Journal of International
Writing, and Zyzzyva..

  NAMI MUN was born in a tiny village in South Korea, which has since
disappeared beneath the urban sprawl of Seoul. At eight, she moved to the
United States, to the Bronx where she got good grades, got into fights, and
at thirteen, left a soured home situation to find her own way. Since then,

[Spoken at Tomsk State University's Faculty of Philosophy, IX.17.2004,
continued]:

Films have been in the making for more than a century, and there are by
now at least as many tacit assumptions of how a film should be made as
there once were for the novel. Peter Gidal has remarked that "the
realist novel lives on today largely in the guise of commercial
narrative cinema" (qtd. in Byg 237).  Since more attention is generally
given to the representation than to the method of its making, such basic
concepts as the frame, the shot and the cut are impossible to ignore, as
most films endeavor to present an appearance of naturalness by strictly
following conventions. The most conventional films draw no attention to
how they are made. By giving attention to the length of the shot in the
film, 87 minutes, the concept of the frame materializes, beginning with
the 24 frames in a second which give the motion picture the appearance
of the naturally seen and ending with the absence of frame from the
digital camera, the single take in Russian Ark recorded onto a portable
hard drive and then transferred to 35mm film stock for distribution to
cinema theaters. Can attention to a technical aspect of the film bring
into view larger questions pertaining to the idea of toleration? A new
work of art challenges our conceptions and definitions, and among them
is this concept of the frame. Kunjundzic even claims for the filmed
image of the Hermitage "that its aesthetic or political representation
in the movie may be nothing but a narrative about the framing of Russian
history."

Frame and shot and cut open up the immense problem of how to represent
time. What is the threshold of what it is possible to view, and is this
threshold the same as the threshold of what can and cannot be seen? In
Kujundzic's essay the cut is Vertov's: "Another repressed subtext of the
long take engaged by the movie, is the whole modernist impact of the
kino-eye by Dziga Vertov, or catching life unawares, and his application
of the cut as the generative device of his filming. The Man with the
Movie Camera consists not only of extremely short takes mounted to
create an incredibly rapid sequence of events, rupturing the 'regular'
flow of historical time, erasing the past and history (the theater which
is broken), but even includes some of the subliminal and invisible takes
which go below the theshold of visibility as they are shorter than 24
frames and therefore cannot be perceived except as the visual
unconscious of the movie."

The camera never blinks, they say about Sokurov's film. They are
Natascha Drubek-Meyer, Raoul Eshelman and Katja Petrovskaja writing from
Munich, Dragan Kujundzic writing from the University of
California-Irvine, Nele Sasz writing from Berlin, and Ulrich Schmid
writing from Frankfurt. Their roundtable discussion addresses the
theshold of the limits of toleration: the length of the shot and its
simulation of historical time.  Here is a sample of their points of
view:

Petrovksaja: "The one shot approach here functions as a synonym of real
time and real history, as if reality as such was presented. But at the
same time the absence of cuts causes 'ideological cuts' and reductions."

Eshelman: "The uncut 87-minute time of the shot, is Everyman's time.
It's the same time you would get if you would be able to film your
sister's wedding reception with a camcorder in one continuous sequence.
The time of the shot is real time, essentially parallel to the viewer's
time [...] this is banal, artless time; it's the time you want to get
out of by tapping into duration."

Petrovskaja: "The absence of cuts turns out to be the putting on of
blinders, or turns into an inability to see something else [...] the
technical characteristics of the film deprive the spectator of the
possibility of seeing from 'another point of view.'"

Drubek-Meyer: "The extremely long shot averts the attention from vision
and stimulates us to feel other senses [...] by showing different
textures, by adding the murmuring off voice. [...] Sokurov makes the
digital experience a tactile one. It is as if the steadicam closely
connected with Buettner's body by a special vest and a backpack
construction made it possible to record / see / feel reality with the
whole body."

Kujundzic: "Far from being an attempt at 'restoration' of the imperial
past, it is an evidence of the disruptive power of history and
irreversibility of its passing. The period and the world which the film
'restores' suffers from multiple historico-political and aesthetic
erasures. [...] The incessant, theoretically infinite or at the very
least uncut, gaze without a blink, opens itself to a relentless
rupturing and ruination of the visible and the represented."

Eshelman: "The immanent long shot has been made to pass through an even
longer, transcendent span of time [...] to jump-start history again, to
create a singular event in the open sea of an otherwise eventless
post-historical expanse."

Petrovskaja: "The absence of montage in this film is a very dangerous
symptom for the growing symbiosis of 'independent intellect' and the
usurpation of point of view, which is slowly but surely taking place in
Russia where, actually, even oppositional TV is brought to zero."

[Spoken at Tomsk State University's Faculty of Philosophy, IX.17.2004,
continued]:

A Russian audience would know very well the story of the empty frames at
the Hermitage during the siege of Leningrad passed across allusively in
Russian Ark, the ones left hanging in the halls after the paintings were
removed to Sverdlovsk. This parable of absence finds an echo in
Benjamin's remarks on Eugene Atget's use of emptiness and its usefulness
for a later generation of surrealists: "Empty is the Porte d'Arceuil by
the fortifications, empty are the triumphal steps, empty are the
courtyards, empty, as it should be, is the Place du Tertre. They are not
lonely, merely without mood; the city in these pictures looks cleared
out, like a lodging that has not yet found a new tenant" ("The Little
History of Photography" 519).  Several of the Art Margins correspondents
mention the intellectual tension in Russian Ark as being situated in the
awareness of the clearing out of the lodging that was once the Winter
Palace which, in the suppression of all reference to this evacuation
monumentalized by Eisenstein's 1927 October, and displaced by the more
explicable event of the siege of Leningrad, makes itself all the more
forcefully present by its absence.

"The distance to the past is inviolable," writes one film scholar in a
study published almost ten years ago of the cinema of Daniele Huillet
and Jean-Marie Straub (Byg 45). Three points from this study bear
mentioning here. The first has to do with the technique of the single
take and its attempt to represent real time. Sokurov has been quoted as
having said that he had wanted to make a film in a single take for
fourteen years, but he is not the first director to have this
conception.  A question from a 1981 interview with Rainer Werner
Fassbinder asks about Straub's influence: "But weren't you inspired by
him to use a slow narrative rhythm, and a principle of real time in
which occurrences on the screen last exactly as long as they do in
reality?" (Qtd. in Byg 90). The second point refers to the work of
mourning in post-war German cinema and many film-makers' interpretations
of the twentieth-century history of Nazism as collective trauma and loss
of a classical cultural heritage. In Eric Santner's study, Stranded
Objects, attention is drawn to "ambitious attempts by recent German
artists to create works of national elegiac art: works that make use of
the procedures and resources of mourning to constitute something like a
German self-identity in the wake of the catastrophic turns of recent
German history. In each case the task of mourning involves the labor of
recollecting the stranded objects of a cultural inheritance fragmented
and poisoned by an unspeakable horror" (qtd. in Byg 44). It's
interesting to note how close this description comes to Dragan
Kujundzic's reading of Russian Ark as a work of mourning: "After the
Soviet Revolution, a sense of a loss occupies the space in Russian
historical identity, since the past prior to it becomes inaccessible for
historical continuation, restoration, and mourning." He also writes of
Sokurov's film that "the Soviet period represents an absent cause of The
Russian Ark, its catastrophic effects on the building generate the
repressed or invisible origin that makes this movie possible." Thus, the
film "could mark the beginning of the assessment of the Petrine
tradition as the site of melancholic desire for Russian identificatory
aspirations." This association of Nazism with Stalinism reiterates,
however obliquely, the German historian Ernst Nolte's revisionist thesis
that the world wars were a class struggle civil war disguised as
inter-imperialist conflicts. The third point remembers Bertolt Brecht's
and Walter Benjamin's ideas about the heightened unreality of the
cinema: "The legitimation of bourgeois ideology begins with the very
same 'unreality' in cinema that Brecht saw but uses it to strengthen,
rather than reveal, the power of its novelistic representations of
imaginary social relations" (Byg 237).

language
of power.  There's no point in asking whether they are sincere or
hypocritical,
whether they want peace of whether they calculate the risks.  The dominating
impression as such a moment is that something that may pass for a prescribed
good; information addresses and captures impotent crowds to whom it is poured

forth like a liquor that leaves them dazed as they move toward the slaughter
house.
One might even ask if one would allow the cataclysm to occur without first
giving
free reign to this hubbub of voices...."

9:15 am - SMALL PRESS COMMUNITIES. Moderator, Mike Kelleher, Artistic =
Director, Just Buffalo Literary Center, and Editor of ELEVATOR.=20
Partly due to chance, partly to choice, the history of small press =
activity in America is one of active production of communities: of =
writers, of readers and of other publishers, all acting outside the =
mainstream of publishing houses and distribution networks. What has =
resulted is an entire alternate universe of publication and =
distribution, one in which publishers, largely freed from profit =
concerns actively participate in the production of various esthetic and =
ideological communities centered on writing. This panel, consisting of a =
group of contemporary independent publishers, will discuss the =
challenges of creating communities through small press publication and =
distribution.=20

Rousseau's Boat by Lisa Robertson. 40 pp. ISBN 0-9735337-1-4 $12.00 plus
$2.50 for p&p.

                The ebb and flow of this water, its ongoing soiund swelling
with vibration that set adrift my outer senses, rhythmically took the place
of the strong emotions my dreaminess had calmed, and I felt in myself so
pleasurably and effortlessly the sensation of existing, without troubling to
think.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau

Good Egg Bad Seed by Susan Holbrook 16pp. ISBN 0-9735337-0-6 $10.00 plus
$2.50 for p&p.
                Starting with the premise "There are two kinds of people,"
Susan Holbrook drives supermarket existentialism through its own vortex and
gives it a nifty orgasmic twist into hyperspace. Here's a ping pong game
you'll never forget - where the tables keep flipping and the players' ironic
bats spin the banal into deadly mischievous curves.

Subject:      Logic of the Long Take 4
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

[Spoken at Tomsk State University's Faculty of Philosophy, IX.17.2004,
4th of 4 parts]:

After the same war that the drone of planes and the starving carpenter
evoke in Russian Ark, Brecht established the Berliner Ensemble in East
Germany. Antigone, Galileo and Mother Courage were among the plays
staged at this time, and for these productions a Model Book was
conceived for the purpose of documenting the original performance in
view of the problem of interpretation by future directors. These Model
Books consisted largely of photography, and the photographer for them
was a member of the Berliner Ensemble, an acknowledged co-author of The
Caucasian Chalk Circle, Ruth Berlau. Her photography confirms the
comment by Louis Althusser in an review of the original production of
Mother Courage, where he mentions the ashen black and grey stage, and
the idea of a stage of ashen black and grey rising out of a world in
ashes is also projected by the Mutter Courage Modell, the photography
for which was determined by the demands of the stage lighting, shots
taken at low exposure with a Leica 35mm camera, the minimal light
leaking into shutter set at the threshold where the image begins to
blur. Apart from their documentary function, which as Brecht recorded in
his diary was how he thought of them, Berlau's photography for the Model
Books might also be viewed as representing the first interpretation of
the post-war Brechtian theater, a visual re-mix reinscribed with the
same muteness that afflicts Kattrin in Mother Courage. In the
photographer's interpretation the real-time continuum of the performance
is seized, halted and isolated into a series of frames, reconstructing
from the performance an analytical montage in which cut and frame are
foregrounded as necessary devices of the cinematic image.

The cinema is being thought about by Berlau in this late-1940s
photography, and in a significant way the lessons of Sergei Eisenstein
and Dziga Vertov, perhaps filtered through the Workers Photography
Movement in pre-war Germany, are being appropriated and applied by an
artist so marginalized that it is difficult to claim for her any
intention beyond Brecht's own. Bringing the marginal figure of a
photographer like Berlau into the discussion of Russian Ark follows the
direction of Benjamin's reference to Atget in his essay, The Little
History of Photography, and including both Berlau and Atget in reference
to Sokurov's film provides another frame for viewing the technical work
of Tilman Buettner, despite the changes in the cameras themselves. The
speed of the lenses was an issue already in the 1880s, and for Benjamin,
the darkness surrounding the first subjects was disappearing. Kujundzic
writes of the spectrality of Russian Ark, though in contrast with the
early years of photography the darkness of the digital cinema looks
artificial, pure simulacra, a copy of a copy, or appearance of the
appearance. The darkness of the Berliner Ensemble's stage in post-war
East Germany is uncanny for its representation of history (the Thirty
Years War and its allegorical overlay with World War II) and the aura of
ash. "What is aura, actually? A strange weave of space and time: the
unique appearance or semblance of distance, no matter how close it may
be" ("The Little History of Photography" 518). From the analysis of the
1948 staging of Mother Courage accomplished by Berlau's cutting into the
time of the production and developing the visual sign of duration, the
recent war is distanced and made visible to the mind's eye, which is to
say that the thought of the recent war, the war that was still too close
to be seen, in 1948, begins to approach the perception of the intellect
in that theater.

Does Russian Ark do just the opposite by trying to bring near what is
inviolably distant, deploying the single take, the long shot and its
documentary frisson of unedited time, manufacturing darkness where there
is none, that darkness which for Benjamin held "the tiny spark of
contingency, of the here and now, with which reality has (so to speak)
seared the subject"? ("The Little History of Photography" 510). It is
too easy to dismiss montage when such imposing figures as Eisenstein and
Vertov, not to mention Malevich, are mentioned in the Art Margins
roundtable as post-revolutionary influences whose tradition is being
suppressed, or erased, in Russian Ark. For Benjamin, writing in 1931,
"the Russian feature film was the first opportunity in decades to put
before the camera people who had no use for their photographs. And
immediately the human face appeared on film with new and immeasurable
significance. But it was no longer a portrait. What was it?" ("The
Little History of Photography" 519-20). This is precisely the question
incited by the shock of the new and its multiple exposures, or long
takes, all that the physiognomy of anonymity and collectivity cannot
answer with a single word or date in time, like 1913.

The following is from Giles Scott, director of "A"-21 at the Zukofsky
conference. The production is a must-see for anyone interested in Zukofsky
and/or the possibilities of poets' theater--not to be missed!

*****

Fresh from NY city and Columbia University's LZ/100 conference, the
backyard players will perform Louis Zukofsky's "A"-21, directed by Giles
Scott, for the last time this coming weekend in San Francisco. Two shows
only and then put in mothballs probably for another 100 years.

A tale of ne'er do wells, mistaken identity, girls down on their luck,
pimps and almost prostitutes--Zukofsky's incredible madcap translation is
one for the ages.

When: Friday October 1 and Saturday October 2 at 8pm
Where: Xenodrome, 1320 Potrero (at 25th)
Cost: Sliding scale $15-20
To reserve tickets please e-mail gilesscott@hotmail.com and say how many
tickets and for which night.

TWO WORKSHOPS BEGIN THIS WEEK:

Writing For Children and Teenagers, with Harriet K. Feder
4 Saturdays Oct 2, 9, 23, 30, 12 p.m. - 2 p.m.
$135, $110 for members

Is that story for kids you long to write cowering inside your head? Is it
gasping for air beneath the clutter in your desk? Then it's time to come out
of the drawer. Learn to capture your readers with an intriguing "Hook;"
build Believable Characters; use a single Point Of View, Identify a
Conflict, Show Rather Than Tell and Market your work to an editor. Harriet
K. Feder, a former editor of Tom Thumb's Magazine and instructor for the
Institute of Children's Literature has published books for everyone from
toddlers to teens in the US and abroad.. Her most recent young adult novel,
Death On Sacred Ground was a 2002 nominee for both Edgar and Agatha awards;
a Sidney Taylor Notable Book; a Children's Literature Choice; and a New York
Public Library Teen Choice. Her writing has won her a Woman of
Accomplishment Legacy Project Award along with such other Western New York
notables as Lucille Ball, Joyce Carol Oates, Virginia Kroll, and Gerda
Klein. She is a member of the Society of Children's Book Writers and
Illustrators, Mystery Writers of America, Sisters in Crime, Author's Guild,
and Pennwriters of PA.

Playwriting Basics, with Kurt Schneiderman
6 Tuesdays, October 5-November 9, 7-9 p.m.
$175, $150 for members

A weekly workshop open to novice and experienced playwrights who want to
develop their playwriting abilities through actual writing and in-class feed
back. Bring in new or old work to be read aloud and critiqued by everyone
involved in the workshop. Course will include readings from various classic
theatre texts and discussion of playwriting structure and theory. You can
expect to emerge from this course with some written and workshopped
dialogue, and with an introduction to the overall theoretical framework for
dramatic writing. Kurt Schneiderman is currently Dramaturg for the Buffalo
Ensemble Theatre, the coordinator of the annual new play competition at the
Area Playwrights' Performance Series, and Director of the new play, forum
Play Readings & Stuff. Named one of "Buffalo's emerging young playwrights"
by Gusto Magazine and Buffalo's "next A.R. Gurney" by Artvoice Magazine,
Kurt was the winner of the Helen Mintz Award for Best New Play (2003) and
was nominated for the Artie Award for Outstanding New Play (2004). Most
recently, one of Kurt's plays was chosen for the 2004 Toronto Fringe
Festival.

IN THE MARGINS

This week's column in Artvoice is about the Indie Lit Luau at Medaille
college.  Also, a review of Mark Nowak's new book of poems, Shut Up, Shut
Down, by James Maynard

NEW WORKSHOP JUST ANNOUNCED:

The Art of Transformation
Instructors:  Jimmie Gilliam and Laurie Dean Torrell
3 Tuesdays, 11/16, 11/23, and 11/30 from 6:30-8:30
In The Hibiscus Room at Just Buffalo
$90, $75 for members

Transformations offer an opportunity to enlarge imagination and expand the
sense of what is possible in both life and artistic work.  Beginning again -
suspending judgement, re-framing the familiar, being willing to change
direction - these artistic practices can be employed to navigate times of
change, and can be used to create new work.  In this workshop we will mine
experience, and use the texts The Art of Possibility: Transforming
Professional and Personal Life by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander,
and Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go by Shaun McNiff.
Through discussion and writing exercises we will explore the subject of
transformation.  Participants will have the opportunity to create and share
original essays and poems, and within the three-week period, receive
individual critique if desired.

On Novel Writing, with Linda Lavid
6 Saturdays, September 25, October 2, 9, 23, 30, November 6 10 a.m.-12 p.m.
$175, $150 for members

Time to brush off that manuscript somewhere buried, take the plunge, and
make the commitment to write the great American novel. Yes, the brass ring
can be yours, but first you must write the story. For both veterans and
novices, this seminar will present the critical foundations necessary to
assist you in writing a novel. Topics include: developing plots, building
character, generating scenes and, finally, how to make it all make sense.

The Working Writer Seminar, with Kathryn Radeff
3 Sessions Left: October 16, November 13, December 11, 12 p.m.- 4 p.m.
Single Session: $50, $40 for members

Writing & Selling Short Stories, October 16
Writing Magazine & Newspaper Features: Learn the Methods & Markets, November
13
The Art & Craft of Creative Nonfiction, December 11

Poet As Architect, with Marj Hahne
One Saturday Session, November 20, 12-5 p.m.
$50, $40 for members

Li-Young Lee says that poetry has two mediums-language and silence-and that
language (the material) inflects silence (the immaterial) so that we can
experience (hear) our inner space. In this workshop, we will step outside
our familiar poetic homes and build new dwellings (temples and
taverns!),mutilizing such timber as sound patterns, found text, and invented
forms. We will explore the structural possibilities of language to
ultimately answer the question: How does form serve content? Both beginning
and practiced poets will generate lots of original writing from this full
day of language play and experimentation, and will bring home a fresh eye
with which to revisit old poems stuck in the draft stage.

Matthew 5.14  Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.

(King James version) At least I've always assumed it was an adaptation of that.

This 'poem' is I think  out of line-

is Anselm supposed to be ashamed of who his parents are? They were/are both
important poets and I for one have never felt anything but support from
Anselm he is a fine poet and person. I for one have loved Alice Notley's
workshops they have meant allot to me and I would pay for them again she is
a great poet and a fine teacher. If you have a problem with him or the
poetry project please do it in person- not on the Buffalo list.

I know for a fact that at least two Chicago poets are reading at the Poetry
Project this year. If it was a closed shop this would not be happening. I
know other poets from other cities that have been given this opportunity as
well. I don't think that it is fair or just to accuse people of ethical
lapses this borders on slander.

hey fellas  let's  not  get too out of hand  w/ this

you're both right and both wrong

since i was one of the folk in question in dr n's "poem"  i feel i should
say that
i'd love to read if invited  tho i've  made only a few grabs at trying to
be

despite what  ray might say there are still way too over the top many
political  ploys and hierarachy's involved  in this system  but in ny
it's  how you win while playing the game

i can name many  lesser known folk  who read at po-project who read there
because they
"deserve" to because they are "friends"    publishers of "friends"
newcomers  who came in thru the right door
but i should not say too much  i'm almost 60 now and a few folks know my
name
even tho i'm sure as it leaves their mouthes  and i leave their space
they wonder, if at all,  "who was that guy?"  "where'd he come from?"

from brooklyn     he/me says in me feeble little mind  brooklyn

 i got involved too late  its's not about how long you've been at it
how big your body of work is
but how well your body works  within the scene
i won't use the W word here
and your chicago friends  ( are they academics ) maybe they sent
proposals
and were the lucky ones

unlike someone like ira cohen  who is 70 kicked and been kicked around
this town/world way too long  poet/film maker/ photographer
a true part of history     see his "straw mats" film

ah fk this ranting  i got stuff to write for some small town  zine  that
nobody 'll ever see   but  they don't care

long live the chicago  2     is rosemont  still around?

 >>POV: black american in paris
=========================

   Black American in Paris
   by James Campbell

   In the spring of 1960, the year of his death, the novelist Richard
   Wright wrote from Paris to his friend and Dutch translator Margrit de
   Sabloni&egrave;re:

   You must not worry about my being in danger.... I am not exactly
   unknown here and I have personal friends in the de Gaulle cabinet
   itself. Of course, I don't want anything to happen to me, but if it
   does my friends will know exactly where it comes from.... So far as
   the Americans are concerned, I'm worse than a Communist, for my
   work falls like a shadow across their policy in Asia and Africa....
   They've asked me time and again to work for them: but I'd rather
   die first.

   This letter contains the essence of John A. Williams's roman &agrave;
   clef, The Man Who Cried I Am, first published in 1967. Wright, an
   ex-Communist who had turned his back on the party and moved to France
   in 1946 but had never succeeded in throwing off the attentions of the
   American government, died unexpectedly in a Paris clinic eight months
   after writing those words to Sabloni&egrave;re in Leiden, Holland,
   and their eerie prescience has kept speculation about his death
   smoldering ever since. The Man Who Cried I Am, which opens in Leiden,
   brings a heavy load to the fire. It charts the journey through the
   1940s and '50s of Max Reddick, a black novelist and journalist,
   leading up to the death of Reddick's friend and mentor, Harry Ames.
   Harry is an expatriate former Communist living in Paris with a white
   wife and a career on the slide. "I'm the way I am, the kind of writer
   I am, and you may be too," he tells Max early in the novel, which
   proceeds by way of flashbacks and a jigsaw structure, "because I'm a
   black man; therefore we're in rebellion; we've got to be. We have no
   other function as valid as that one."

   This repudiation of writing that is not politically committed sets
   the tone of The Man Who Cried I Am. In the parallel, real-life story
   that runs a few feet below the surface of Williams's novel, Harry's
   remark also serves as a dismissal of James Baldwin's famous attack on
   Richard Wright as the author of "protest fiction" in his precocious
   essay "Everybody's Protest Novel," published in Partisan Review in
   1949. Harry Ames is decisively committed, or as his French friends
   would have said, engag&eacute;. Harry has long been a thorn in the
   flesh of the American government, and Max suspects that someone--even
   someone from among their own cafe circle--was deputed to kill him.
   For Max, Harry's very existence was a challenge to white power; so
   his death is one more deferment of the dream of racial justice. The
   consequences, as set out here, are likely to be apocalyptic. Williams
   was surely in earnest in predicting a bloody reckoning, for he
   followed The Man Who Cried I Am with Sons of Darkness, Sons of Light,
   a story written in the late 1960s but set in the next decade, with
   the uprising about to begin.

   Wright was the pioneer and leader of a school of black writers who
   left behind the hazards of daily life in the United States in the
   late 1940s and early '50s for the comparative freedoms of France.
   Those who followed included not only Baldwin but also Chester Himes,
   William Gardner Smith and Richard Gibson. In his journal in January
   1945, a year before his migration, Wright described Paris as "a place
   where one could claim one's soul."

   That Harry Ames is a dead ringer for Richard Wright nobody would
   deny, least of all John A. Williams. In the 1990s, while researching
   a book about Anglophone literary life in Paris after the Second World
   War, I asked Williams if it was fair to make the connection between
   Ames and Wright. He said it was. When asked if Wright might have been
   been assassinated by the American security services, Williams
   replied, "I would say his death was highly suspicious" (he added, "I
   wouldn't put it any stronger than that"). His suspicions arose from
   conversations with people who were in France at the time of Wright's
   death, most notably the novelist Chester Himes, who had been close to
   Wright though the two were by then estranged. Asked why the
   government would risk murdering a writer who was no longer a force in
   the civil rights movement, Williams said, "I do believe there is such
   a thing as teaching people a lesson."

   The official cause of Wright's death on November 28, 1960, was the
   obstruction of a coronary artery--a heart attack. His body was
   cremated, without a post-mortem. Almost immediately, rumors began to
   circulate that he had been poisoned. A mystery woman was said to have
   visited his bedside an hour before he died. There was talk of an
   urgent telegram dispatched from the clinic. In his memoir, My Life of
   Absurdity, Himes named a "soul brother" by whom Wright felt he "was
   being persecuted." More than thirty years later, a friend of Wright
   from Paris days, the cartoonist Ollie Harrington, told me, "I know
   Richard Wright was assassinated" (despite promptings, he remained
   vague as to how he knew). Speaking on a BBC radio program about her
   father in October 1990, Julia Wright put it more subtly, giving
   credence to "a CIA plot to isolate him, in order to make him more
   vulnerable," thus fatally undermining his health. After a poorly
   attended service--Wright's wife, Ellen, had wished to keep it
   closed--the author's ashes were interred in P&egrave;re Lachaise
   cemetery. In The Man Who Cried I Am, Max attends Harry's funeral in
   Paris: "Charlotte, Harry's wife was there, a few Americans.... There
   were some Africans, a few Indians. And it was only twenty hours after
   Harry had died."

   The Man Who Cried I Am is the kind of novel that many novelists dream
   of writing--a bulging bag that seems to contain everything the author
   knows about life. It is a book that hums with sound and smell, and a
   good deal more hate than love. Its greatest strength is in making the
   reader feel the height and solidity of the oppressive wall that Max,
   Harry and others must negotiate daily, just to hoist themselves up to
   safety, to be able to say, "I am." In his introduction to the new
   edition, Walter Mosley compares it to The Odyssey and Max to
   Odysseus. "And the journey home is more dangerous than Odysseus could
   ever imagine," he writes with reckless abandon. The minutiae of Max's
   existence are crammed in, from his talent to his paranoia, down to
   his culinary skills. An odd touch of authenticity is added by the
   graphic descriptions of a rectal illness that plagues him throughout.
   The Man Who Cried I Am takes lungfuls of breath from the author's
   angry energy, and from his ability to convey to the reader his belief
   that he is uncovering hidden truths.

   While Williams succeeds in bringing Max Reddick to life, he fails to
   make him likable. Max is a bristling bundle of conspiracy theories,
   glued together with hatred for white men and desire for white women.
   The latter seems at times closer to sadism than affection. Nothing
   good happens to Max--a job at Pace magazine (for Pace, read Time), a
   White House speechwriting assignment--that is not the product of
   white men's cynical maneuvering. There is scarcely a white male
   character who isn't a creep, and hardly a white female character who
   is not the target of the "cocksman" Max fancies himself. From one
   point of view, it is a bravura depiction of a peculiar pathology.
   From another, it feels as if Williams, intending to create a hero,
   has brought into being an emotional Frankenstein.

   Williams emerged as the patience of the civil rights movement was
   hardening to anger, and he has always been an angry writer. His books
   are apt to take anger as a viable substitute for morality. His first
   novel was called The Angry Ones. In 1962 he edited a collection of
   writings called The Angry Black, to which he himself contributed a
   story about a writer, Wendell, who tries to seduce a white woman in
   her own home. She first welcomes his advances, then tries to
   disengage herself as her son is heard approaching, but Wendell holds
   her in a clinch just long enough for the 9-year-old to see them. By
   any standard of decency, Wendell's rationale is tantamount to child
   abuse: "no matter how his mother explains it away, the kid has the
   image for the rest of his life."

   It is a form of revenge that Max Reddick could as easily have taken.
   In Max's eyes, bad luck is a stranger to whites--"What have you got
   to be nervous about?" he teases an associate. "You're white"--whereas
   almost every misfortune in a black life is traceable to color. Such
   an apprehension is enough to drive someone mad, and at times,
   rereading this novel, I felt that Max had taken leave of his senses.
   "Dying violently was a European habit," he reflects at one point,
   thinking of a French friend:

   All other deaths were commonplace. A European learned by his
   condition to expect catastrophe and invariably that was exactly what
   he received. In Europe, a winner was one who bested those common
   deaths arbitrarily assigned to others. You crawled, kissed behinds,
   ate merde, and grinned like you loved it. Living was everything. The
   final act of death was of no consequence; it was the living while
   everyone around died that counted.

   Max's sexual politics are likely to seem equally unappetizing to a
   present-day readership (and probably did to many in 1967). Women are
   there for the taking. Max is the kind of fellow who passes the time
   in his office making lists of those he has slept with. He and Harry
   keep up a running joke about the unique delights of "redheads." The
   novel is shot through with reflections such as this, on Max's Dutch
   girlfriend, Margrit: "Time sped by. Now, she was almost thirty. In
   Europe that made you an old maid or a lesbian. Or a whore. Managing
   an art gallery hadn't helped. She had gone through a couple of
   painters, or more correctly, they had gone through her."

   To what extent the reader is expected to accommodate Max because, as
   he says, "it was bad when I was born" (i.e., "born black"), is
   unclear, but I suspect that Williams feels he should be indulged
   quite a bit. Max certainly does. He lacks the faculty of
   self-examination. For example, he is said to be unpopular at the
   houses that have published his novels because "he...liked white
   women." Presented this way, it sounds like blatant racism, but might
   not the publishers simply be collating the observation about his love
   life with an insight Max provides into his own character: "Max had
   already given himself a name; he was a pimp without briefcase.... you
   borrowed money from the girl and the girl knew you'd never pay it
   back, and chances were, every time you met you'd borrow more money"?
   In Max's endlessly self-justifying hatred of the outside world, his
   tireless generalizing, there is no need for self-scrutiny, for every
   personal criticism can be deflected by the countercharge of racism.

   Various figures who circled in Wright's orbit during his fourteen
   years in France are depicted under light disguise in The Man Who
   Cried I Am. A scene in a Left Bank cafe, involving Max, Harry Ames
   and a young disciple of Harry's called Marion Dawes, is a rough
   rendering of a meeting that took place in the spring of 1953 between
   Wright, Himes (the character of Max contains elements of Himes) and
   Baldwin. It was during this stormy encounter, recorded by all three
   principals, that Baldwin gave warning to Wright, "The sons must slay
   the fathers." In the first volume of his memoirs, The Quality of
   Hurt, Himes described the incident, adding that he thought at the
   time that Baldwin had gone crazy; "but in recent years I've come to
   better understand what he meant."

   No such empathy is extended to the Baldwin character, Marion Dawes,
   who is treated unkindly. Baldwin and Williams, almost exact
   contemporaries, were never close, and it's hard to imagine that
   Baldwin would have been amused to see himself as Marion Dawes, whose
   homosexuality makes him a target for Max's disgust and ridicule. (It
   is suggested that Dawes gained a fellowship by means of which he
   moved to France by sleeping with certain people; in real life,
   Baldwin got a Eugene F. Saxton award on the recommendation of
   Wright.) Crucially for Max and Harry, Dawes is not a "writer in
   rebellion." The young Baldwin's concerns were more aesthetic than
   political, and he spent his nine years in Paris coaching his heart to
   exorcise the outrage that he feared would kill him if left to fester.
   Max, on the other hand, is consumed by anger. He cannot pick up the
   telephone without seeing it as "another one of the white man's
   inventions," and reflecting that it was "ironic that one must
   inevitably come to use the tools of the destroyer in order to destroy
   him, or to save oneself."

   Near the end of the novel, Max is trying to relay to a Malcolm X
   figure, Minister Q, the contents of a file discovered among Harry's
   papers, which outlines the King Alfred Plan, an FBI- and CIA-designed
   scheme to "terminate, once and for all, the Minority threat" and to
   consolidate the league of nations known as the "Alliance blanc," or
   White Alliance. In his afterword, Williams compares the King Alfred
   Plan, his own invention, to intelligence programs devised by J. Edgar
   Hoover in the 1960s to monitor the movements of black militants,
   which did not become public until much later. Harry is already a
   victim of the King Alfred Plan, and Max fears that he is about to
   become another.

   The Man Who Cried I Am is an absorbing story about the way some
   people were thinking and acting in the 1950s. It is driven by a
   furious beat, and constantly illuminated by the real-life drama
   behind the fictional one. It is let down by loose writing and a lack
   of generous characterization. The latter may be ascribed to Max's
   solipsism, and no doubt there are powerful psychological reasons for
   that, but a solipsist is hardly a trustworthy guide. Walter Mosley's
   ingenious classical comparison must be tested against the objection
   that Max is not a tragic hero but a pathetic one, wounded as much by
   vanity and self-pity as by racism.

   Does the conspiracy theory about Wright's death have any basis in
   reality? No one has provided a shred of forensic evidence to support
   the notion that he was murdered. From another angle, however, it is
   possible to argue that Wright's premature death was willed by the
   state. In the early 1990s, I visited Wright's widow, Ellen, in her
   apartment in St-Germain des Pr&egrave;s. She spoke about Wright's
   quarrels with Baldwin and others, and said how futile it all seemed
   to her now that these great men were gone. "My husband lived with
   tension all his life," Mrs. Wright said. "Every day, awful tension."
   If there is an alternative cause of death to be inserted beside the
   official entry on Wright's records, then that is surely it.

Hi all,

Our new issue is going to press this coming Tuesday, and we're in need of 2-3
printed matter reviews. Anything released in 2004 is ok, it doesn't have to be
poetry, should only be a small press, and the review should be 250-400 words
max.

The hope here is that some of my fellow list members and bloggers might have
some reviews already in the can that we can print in our pages, crediting their
blogs if that's where they previously appeared.

Please backchannel reviews and queries to editor@boogcity.com

best,
david

just to alert anyone interested that a long-ish chapter from my
memoir has just been published in ~the iowa review~ (vol. 34, number
two):  "just produce:  a meditation on time & materials, past &

actually they are both not academics, I am also not an academic and I agree
that there is allot of Politics but this has been going on since at least
Dante's time.

I dont think that whining is the way to do it- in fact- most of us who do
not live in the New York area resent the fact that New York has what, 10
literary organization and 100 reading series and all the presses? The fact
that mediocre New York poets are published three times over and great and
good poets from the rest of the nation are ignored is a fact too... But
instead of whining we are building new institutions that is what we need to
do to make poetry a vibrant artform--

Seems to me it's actually quite difficult to keep a press going in New York
-- space and expense being primary reasons. I celebrate those that manage
it there. I'm all for building new institutions in all sorts of places, but
I don't see such work as in any way oppositional to what goes on in New
York. More often, I find that I work in partnership with people in New
York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, San Diego, Boulder, Albuquerque,
Milwaukee, Chicago, Phoenix, Tuscaloosa, Los Angeles, and all sorts of
places. And without the support of poets and others in New York, the work
would be more difficult. And if New York has 100 reading series, to the 12
or so reading series in Tucson, and 10 literary organizations (I think
there are at least 8 in Tucson), then that doesn't seem like too many, does
it? What's there to resent?

Haas,

excellent words. i back you up completely: baltimore is not exactly the shining light of the po' scene. it's been a very rough two years linking with the best and brightest of the packs (new lights press, mobtown writers, narrow house recordings, etc.) but the energy we put out is astounding: we've published folks from all over the nation, just to introduce the baltimore public, arts affiliated and general, to what's happening outside the city (baltimore, as some of you may know, may be cliquesque at times...) we're also introducing the nation to the fresh talent that may have well been overlooked if groups like furniture press and new lights press and narrow house recordings never existed.

i'm from NYC. i know just what happens in NYC. there is an abundance, and anyone with a press is usually gonna score some great talent; it's also going to (over)produce a lot of talent that is just beginning to ripe. it may be too focused on output rather than building a base of poetics. but i'm not at all disturbed: NYC is a huge fucking city and it more or less deserves to have 10 literary organizations and 100 reading series and let's add 1,000 presses. what's good, though, about the multitude of ideas and events, is that all groups have a voice in the life of the poetic world. why shut them down? even if they are mediocre? let the best and brightest and hardest working survive history!

we have an excellent reading series, the portable reading series, and it took heartache and stomach aches to make it happen: a crowd of 40 is unusual at literary events in baltimore.

location location location

or

loquation loquation loquation

it's all about attitude and spirit and energy and dialogue.

cliques don't count. they can't survive history. they'll be drowned out by the innovative.

i don't know. anything else.

my love to all small presses, disparate and not.

Here in West Lima Wisconsin there are no reading series & one literary

well,,,, surprise surprise -- only one poet on the MacArthur list this year
-- NY TIMES: Mr. Socolow, the director of the Fellows program, "said the
number of fellows in new areas this year reflects the foundation's search
for fresh talent by increasing the number of people nominating fellows
across a broad spectrum of fields."  So what name in poetry did this

this is actually an interesting question, this question of who's
in(side) and who's out(side), both in terms of perceptions and in
terms of, well, feelings... esp. interesting when it's clear that
those on the inside often don't perceive themselves to BE on the
inside...

(and i'm acutely aware of my own status here in such terms, as a
faltering academic...)

on the one hand one could certainly choose to imagine everyone, every
group as working in concert, as it were, and all collectives as
mutually reinforcing...

at the same time, i've often *felt* excluded, and not on the basis
simply of who i am, but on the basis of who i'm not... i don't think
we can wish away these feelings, and in fact i think they're often
justified...

it's not that every group, so defined, needs must welcome each and
all... this problem, or problematic, in fact is one that has haunted
this list, off and on, for years now, as many of you are aware...

the problem really has more to do with how each group, so defined,
handles its self-identity... if the group presumes to make an appeal
to (some form of) egalitarianism and is not so (to said extent), why
then that *is* sufficient cause for griping (of whatever sort)...
there will then be those who "play" to the non-egalitarian
(non-meritocratic, etc.) premises upon which said collective is
founded... we tend to call these people careerists...

one could say that we're all, to varying degrees, players and
careerists in respective our spheres of professional endeavor... but
i prefer myself to reserve such terms for those who would act
unethically and with abandon in the pursuit of their careers... and i
realize how loaded that last sentence is...

what further complicates this of course is that poets (esp. poets who
are not academics) often have a hard time thinking of what they do IN
TERMS OF career... i might object to the term myself... what makes it
useful, at some level (and here libbie rifkin's ~career moves~ comes
immediately to mind) is that the term foregrounds the possibility
that people might actually be acting for a reason, and that that
reason might be self-gain...

(witness my "self-promotion" post to this list of just an hour or two ago...)

i know it might be hard to accept in these quarters, but there's
little question that self-gain---whether cultural, or symbolic, or
what have you---motivates both poets of the avant-garde (and
post-avant) and poets of the mainstreams... both groups (and i am
quite aware there are not "two") have their share of careerists, and
both groups can be exclusive to an off-putting and self-absorbed
degree... though my loyalties do extend toward those tribes that i
perceive to be the underdog in [cough] fiscal terms (i.e., not the
mainstreams), i trust i don't have to detail the many times i've been
left in despair after having observed woefully careerist behavior
(and i'm sure you each have your own examples)... in all, i've met
creeps on both sides of the line (in the sand), and i don't tend to
presume quality of *character* based on what side of the line one
falls on...

:  i've always felt that any publicly responsible arts group has an
obligation to try to extend a handshake to those who are not part of
the group, but who yet exhibit an interest or ability that might
properly draw them within the group's articulated orbit (after all,
not everyone *wants* to be a _______ poet---no collective, so
defined, will likely be all things to all people)... the difficulty
here turns on maintaining a balance between the cohesion necessary
for a group to be a, well, group, and that quotient of openness and
capacity for self-critique that we ascribe to any healthy
institution... i'm not talking about expanding the capacity of a
finite (in terms of resources, funding, etc.) enterprise toward some
democratically unfeasible ideal... i'm talking about the simple
courtesy of extending a welcome to (say) a newbie... and trying to be
as receptive as possible to strangers... it's understandable, with
the arts under siege at present (or at least, this is what i'm
feeling, at least), for groups to turn inward, keep to their/our own
kind...

but this is a mistake...

now there are (at least) two further problems that surface here:
first, there's the threat of admitting provocateurs into one's
midst... i have in mind here the way certain anti-feminist feminists
have infiltrated online women's discussion groups... classrooms are
another example... it's not enough to say that feminism ought to be
able to hold its own against same... when the overarching mission is
learning, say, and there are people present whose objective is to
frustrate the terms of said learning, why then things can fall apart
rapidly, given the structures and strictures in place in a typical
institution of higher learning, which these people are only too happy
to exploit (i'm trying to speak from experience, ergo my choice of
examples)... so here i'm tempted to steal a line from c. hitchens and
offer something like, "let's not get too democratic"... by which i
simply mean, i wouldn't want the terms of interaction to overturn the
very possibility of democratic behavior (this has to do with my value
system, sure, and of course the fact that i really can be a prick if
you push me too hard)...

the second problem has to do with how, specifically, a group is to
meet its social obligations... it's surely the case that the way to
do so is not simply through membership drives... and the presence of
federal or state monies doesn't in itself automatically stipulate
that everyone must be invited to the party anyway, albeit there are
usually  conditions... to say simply that one's writing/reading
collective is contributing to a better planet by virtue of
facilitating the dissemination of good words may be a little too
easy, but at the same time, even to do this much, as we all (should)
know, is no small feat... so here we're really discussing what the
actual *mission* of such an enterprise ought to be, and we probably
ought to do so with the good graces to be appreciative of those who
are putting their time and energies into such efforts... and this can
be a dicey proposition, to be sure... for instance, i don't always
enjoy open mics---i believe that there's a time and a place for
same... so any collective/group worth its salt will probably have to
renegotiate the terms of its public engagement, on a regular basis...
what works now may not work five or ten years from now---or may...
but self-scrutiny is, from where i sit, a must...

just some quick thoughts... thanks for listening...

best,

joe

You're poo-pooing of the Project? C'mon.

St. Mark's has been a more vibrant & exciting space since Berrigan took
over. The thrust of the complaints is that it hasn't changed enough. That is
to say, who wants to see Alice Notley or Eileen Myles again?

Well, their readings are always well attended. As it's been mentioned- the
Project is PARTIALLY funded, & they've got to get asses in the seats. People
show up because they're dynamite poets. The former director of St. Mark's
had these poets read (as Harry mentioned) "innumerable times". This
contradicts the Berrigan "closed shop" theory.

In fact, the upcoming Project schedule has poets from Boston, Philadelphia,
San Francisco, Paris, etc. Some of these poets I've never heard of. Some of
them I don't like. So what. It's hardly a "closed shop".

This seems a misdirected argument about a larger issue of recognition (or
lack thereof.)

- Frank Sherlock

PS.- I'd love to have Alice Notley read at my series, & she's not my mom.

Here in West Lima Wisconsin there are no reading series & one literary
organization.  The local paper, the LaFarge Episcope publishes a weekly
limerick.  For some of us our experience of literary culture is 99%
online.

Here's a little thing I wrote during award season several years back. A=20
"casual," you might call it, and its title is

THE CALL

Baker Bladstone was in the middle of canning the entire Baker Bladstone=20
Dance Co. when The Call came to his mid-town studio.

Cissy de Hennaegis was reaching wearily for the thesaurus when she got The=
=20
Call in her converted garage.

It came to Sonia Stone Furlong in the form of a handed note, at the=20
dedication ceremony for the new wing.

=93Patches=94 McGillicuddy was greeted with the news by his fans outside=20
Walgreen=92s.

Shortly after The Call came to Archer Bledsoe, he began watering the house=
=20
plants with his finest single malt scotch. =93Chicken feed to me now =96=
 I=92ll=20
buy a case! Ten cases!=94

Damson Furpiece let her answering machine take The Call, and later blended=
=20
the recording into one of her ambient soundscapes.

The Call came too late to save Tucker Timpson Thomas, whose apartment was=20
already being dusted for fingerprints.

Gennady Overt, however, got The Call in the nick of time, just as he was=20
about to sell his prized Jaguar.

Patricia Matamoros de la Huerta regarded her husband silently as she took=20
The Call on her cell phone. =93He=92s not going to be able to keep up,=94=
 she=20
thought to herself, =93where I=92m going.=94

Dante Thrush surveyed the haggard face in his dressing-room mirror, not=20
sure the image reflected there was his own.

Lawrence Vestibule rose halfway out of his armchair with delight.

But it was R. Faith Hooper who summed it up for all recipients of The Call=
=20
when she slapped her forehead and groaned, =93Why did I have to go and blow=
=20
my first-time homeowners tax credit on this shit-box?=94

Where will YOU be when THE CALL comes?

Will you answer it?

Will it be for you?

pivotal three-poet weekly Sunday poetry group with Spicer and Blaser in

great sequences which now appear in print for the first time in Fulcrum

Something Bad Has Begun
(originally published Sep 28, 2004 by the Los Angeles Times)

by Yusuf Islam
=A0
I was flying to Nashville last week with my 21-year-old daughter to=20
explore some new musical ideas with a record label there. Ironically, I=20=

was trying to remain low-profile because of the speculation that it=20
might have raised in the music world about a return of "the Cat." Media=20=

attention was the last thing I wanted. But it seems God wanted=20
otherwise.

Toward the end of our journey from London to Washington, the plane was=20=

diverted. The captain announced something about "heavy traffic." After=20=

landing in Bangor, Maine, six tall, blue-uniformed officers boarded and=20=

surrounded me and my daughter.

"Is your name Yusuf Islam?" they asked.

"Yes," I confirmed.

"Do you mind coming with us and answering a few questions?"

At that point my heart stopped, and my daughter's face turned=20
aspirin-white. This was the start of the nightmare.

Three FBI agents escorted me away from my daughter and asked me=20
questions. At first, it sounded like they might have me mixed up with=20
somebody else, as they repeated the spelling of my name.

"No. Y-u-s-u-f," I carefully spelled out. The agents looked a bit=20
puzzled.

As they continued asking questions, some of their queries were=20
obviously not related to me, so I thought this must be a matter of=20
simple mistaken identity. Whether it was a mix-up or not remained=20
unclear because they weren't under any obligation to give me a reason;=20=

the green visa waiver form I had so neatly filled in earlier had=20
effectively denied me any right to appeal or answers. It was only when=20=

an immigration official read out to me a legal reference number that he=20=

mentioned some implication with "terrorism" =97 no further details=20
necessary.

The most upsetting thing was being separated from my daughter for 33=20
hours =97 not knowing how she was or when and where we might be united.=20=

Because my phone was confiscated, I couldn't contact my family.

God almighty! Is this the same planet I'd taken off from? I was=20
devastated. The unbelievable thing is that only two months earlier, I=20
had been having meetings in Washington with top officials from the=20
White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to talk=20
about my charity work. Even further back, one month after the attack on=20=

the World Trade Center, I was in New York meeting Peter Gabriel and=20
Hillary Rodham Clinton at the World Economic Forum!

Had I changed that much? No. Actually, it's the indiscriminate=20
procedure of profiling that's changed. I am a victim of an unjust and=20
arbitrary system, hastily imposed, that serves only to belittle=20
America's image as a defender of the civil liberties that so many=20
dearly struggled and died for over the centuries.

Need I say that any form of terrorism or violence is the antithesis of=20=

everything I love and stand for? Anyone who knows me will attest to=20
this. I have spent my life in the search for peace and understanding,=20
and that was mirrored clearly in my music. Since becoming a Muslim, I=20
have devoted my life to education, charity and helping children around=20=

the world.

Consistently I have condemned the attacks of 9/11, stating that the=20
slaughter of innocents, the taking of hostages and coldblooded killing=20=

of women and children have nothing do with the teachings of Islam. I've=20=

openly and publicly repudiated the actions of groups that resort to=20
such acts of inhumanity =97 whatever their names. Any allegations to the=20=

contrary are fabricated. The Koran equates the murder of one innocent=20
person with the murder of all of humanity.

Ever since I embraced Islam in 1977, people have regularly tried to=20
link me with things I have nothing to do with. Take the Salman Rushdie=20=

case as an example, or the regurgitating of the accusation that I=20
support groups like Hamas.

I am a man of peace, and I denounce all forms of terrorism and=20
injustice; it is simply outrageous for anyone to suggest otherwise. The=20=

fact that I have sympathy for ordinary people in the world who are=20
suffering from occupation, tyranny, poverty or war is human and has=20
nothing to do with politics or terrorism.

Thank God my daughter and I were relieved of our ordeal and delivered=20
home safely. I also thank all those who prayed for me and supported me=20=

through this dark episode; I have never harbored any ill will toward=20
people of God's great Earth anywhere =97 and wish the reverse was also=20=

true.

(Yusuf Islam, the singer formerly known as Cat Stevens, was deported to=20=

Britain last week after being refused entry into the United States.)=20=

Sketches of a Mystery White bwai


For erik and the the strange death of jeff Buckley


It the was lawnmowers over the sound of september grape leaves brushing
each other.
So september had swam across the river which flowed underground in
secret. Holding his back at a 1/2 cant he looked like an organic laptop.
You couldn’t find his ass under the baggy combats. That was about it it
ended somewhere near his suede sneakers. Single fisted typing to pound a
knuckle with an amigo. Seems like his length started at this head under
his toque; framing his glasses and it dropped over his face leaving all
neck and the slender was his own; which skittered across the rooms,
arcades and parking lots or stayed seated with likkle motion motioning
the emotion from the tempo which he felt in falsetto holy intros
connected to the downloads on the desktop he played like letters written
like art.

Cee him see the Asiatic blackened sideburned manic unpaniced by the emo
uncoo
So unrealized on couches watching inuyshai

He’skee…suki

She pulled back her bo

No yänki

…and cruise toward a gesture like her hands like fans. He’ski, to watch
him, he absorb the steamed noodles balanced in styrofoam cups emptying
packets of flavour for a lunch over footlong subs he woofed downed
between jobs and senses swayed to basses and drums played like croons.

¡Ya¡ kid
¡Ya¡ kid
¡Ya¡ kid
¡Ya¡ kid
¡Ya¡ kid

So the karaoke night was spent soaking up isa through mics. Did he love
her.
Did she really move. Does she rotate in 3/4 times to a riddim moon to
his sun, son.
What sleak eyes slants to the vision in his haze from the past down in
his fluidity she was feening for. Oh hurun plots a plot for the love his
dub baby. …and gaelic in black language.


¡Ya¡ kid
Come and nice up the cuss; ain’t nobody as tight as us. She stroked his
tongued. Le belle? …ah, you bet. His physical hyme born smooth as aqeeq
across a face. Your age set to affect the cantos of late night drives
homes. He’skee. What was the step of silent trip through parking lots.
Catch it to the dome when you got 8mins to blend the flava w/ the
Abyssinian come mix it up w/ Iranians. Using Alexandrians logic full
metal tactics, stomping Persian’skee and tyrants was, …when… what was
what was done …when… his …didn’t get too carried away over the dame…
come a coffee whispers come 4 pm. 4 or 4:30 language of war or visions
of chloe
What more do you want from…
Do you need
Do you want
Do know when



What can you not have

He kept a light sadness. ...post blues... a tiny tremble of war torn
trouser legs woren out
Desperation. Lord attendants wading in the lots cast to see who’d drown.

Disembodied hands to kiss in the mist surrounding his island

Do you dare

Can you

Care

What was it his life

…when she came into it sucking a on noodle deep in his throat …she
opened it and out swam a purity which he aimed away to form her. In a
letter carbon copied sent messages of intellect it collected his spirit
under his toque framing his thoughts into visuals of memos over long
distances. Read or be. Step into his square; read his flow real slow
He had become flexible with her like junkies on lowlows or what was
meant in the simile by Jeffery Lee.

Delussions of grand figure notes flats to lookin sharp in tones to semi
rational
Textures.

She moved …she moved to a tin drum struck with the caution of his steady
thumb.

My Math Me regained
In madness
Duking it out with Ellington
Eurasian Macluhan
Twistin my melanin
Calculate the african

Strike the Dawn let us holla another Anthem

My Math Me regained
In madness
Duking it out with Ellington
Eurasian Macluhan
Twistin my melanin
Calculate the african

Strike the Dawn let us holla another Anthem

She was not be removed so she moved in stability to the semitry of his
equations; that was her purpose proven in her rotation

Circumference
He got carried away

Power vs measure

sweet

His pleasure…

Step into his square dig his friendship with the listener.

She who must bee

To arkansa come jazzy hep hop. His prayer. A end destination to the bay
as to reach the top of an oak you tip toe over to track your opus. Bee
borns to bop this trip into a sketchy heart when he stayed drunk in his
sobriety. Like a dog warrior drinking from a water bowl loudly. Smooth
has water polished submerged cobblestones. He stroked his fingers along
tops and held one stone tightly briefly neatly and released it. His
fingers cold and stinging he touched his tongue and warmed them by
speaking into the cups of his hands. He ran his tips along the thought
her lashes.
His heart skipped a neat note to the writ he wrote to ghosts behind the
lense of his glasses pressed below the clay.
Tears and blood on the beat of his chin

She moved she moved to a tin drum struck with the caution of his steady
thumb.

She who must bee
She who must bee
She who must bee

He got carried away over her

This was his lost army
Memorials to the nominative

Decline

What’s tru of this
Science of the movement of his thought
Reverie Hallucination
Stay tough in sleepy eyes
Still sweet
How you feel
He asks

When she rests
In this death place
Todd
Sweet
Close your eyes tight
Tight
My brutha
He spoke a hyme like a plate patterned random with the stroke of waves.
Momotaro and peachboy whispers shaking up the mountains and chasing away
the ogres …from the dreams of our bruthas. Watch his tantric circles.
Armless standard barers; his
Visualz

some sort of phenomenology

of the work of hacking and motion-capture in relation to codework
and mywork:

. palimpsest and interweavings
. gatherings around subterranean tokens
. the Wager of the devolution of the natural
which does not hold; the natural excretes, oozes, destroyed by the
cleansed proper body. the worst mistake is the subsummation of the
natural beneath the belly of the technological and the efflorescence
of extinctions that results.
. code as Barrier throughout the world, the operative of code as
distancing, defoliation replacing Vietnam napalm-burn. code destroys
one world, opens another; one always has the attributes of negation
to ensure compliance. with what? with the subject, subjectivity-at-a-
distance.
.Hegel and the porosity of the world
as the physics of the word increasingly turn towards the porous; it's
not hacking by one in relation to the other, but the culture hacked
itself, self-hacked, hacking resonance and harmonics, the hacking of
the hacked (already opened up by O'Reilly's series); in other words,
no privacy, no security, the interweaving of infiltration and
filtration.
. the Plasma neutral
and the plasmatic world, world of the Plasmatics, plasma as standard
states of matter, (un)stated matter, hacking software hacked to soft
hacking, absolute loss of information, fast-forward thought and its
loss.
. momentary negations x^~x -> 0(x)
the null set relative to x-semantics, thus neither x nor not-x but
x-sememe, negation carried through to the other
as x and not-x are venn-separated by inscription relative to (x, not-x),
but x-semantics/sememe "has something to do with it" - so we consider
porosity as those state which "have something to do with things" or
with the configuration, constructibility of things or entities, see
http://www.asondheim.org/statepositive.png
http://www.asondheim.org/statenegative.jpg
. palimpsest and interweavings gatherings
beginning thinking about soft-weavings.
. around subterranean tokens the Wager of the devolution of the natural
code
which is also the waver of the world strewn with entities, in constant
states of withdrawal, maintenance and cleansing
. here against the waver-Wager is where words begin to fail, so does
perceptual organization, some sort of phenomenology (codework breaking,
or the slough of the symbol
. symbolic slough
organization of difference is the origin of institutionalization,
non-deferral

visited  wright's stone where  his ashes were laid     52 refers to his
age which is what i calculated from the headstone
the stone was neglected i brushed away the cobweb and "stole" (stold) a
paper flower from a nearby "plot" and placed it on his..

here's how i felt


richard wright

stuck in the
corner
by
the staircase
                        in black face & gold letters
with cobwebs
                           52 yrs.     an exiled native son

i thank you all for  your input and, believe it or not,  your support of
po-project
and in a broad sense of me - i think some of what i said in reaction to
ray and harry was misconstrued tho i'm not trying to, as harry would say
of me, "weasel" out of anything
yes  i'm am a bit under-recognized ( and maybe rightly so ) and have no
one to blame but myself ( no whining please ) i never participated
actively in the scene tho it was right under my nose
this was just not an option for me  because i never knew this let's call
it SYSTEM existed
some of the first  readings i've ever attended were at the project. i
don't feel, as a genuine whiner who has a rep for complaining, that i
whined or dissed,  just presented some facts as i see them.
and sure all oligarchical structures  operate democratically to some
extent ( the the good ole u.s. of a. for instance)

anselm is a great guy as is his brother and both are fine writers
he has tried to keep an open mind and stuck to both his ideals
to present new voices
and to bring back greatest  hits  to get audiences
for yes  money is needed  in order for any  organization to survive

we all work hard at our work and that we work at is  POETRY
or at least one of the things if not the main one is poetry
tho we feed ourselves by other means  &
in the long run after all, whether anyone sees it or hears it,
it's the work that counts
tho getting others to view it is always a fine thing
when a friend asked me long ago who i write for
i said me whoever i happen to be at that moment
and that means  YOU
he was shocked when i said we all have egos and even more so
want our work to be read for the sake of the work  whether it works or
not
almost everyone thinks what the do really "rocks" wow first time i've
used that word
i would also like you all to know as i previously stated,  harry wrote
his pc
w/out my knowledge and it was a (squirm squirm )  surprise to me too

anyway  since i/he provoked this  please don't get me wrong...

ny is both a great place for its many presses and venues
that's why so many folks move here   but tho
there's  never enough   there can also be too much  ( a glut)
and tho on the surface it seems pleasant to be a part of a scene on any
level
competetion is fierce  ( tho not so much on the overt due to the games
and how they are played )
and  "CAREER" is and has become  way to important to too many
they seem to forget it's about the work
but as i stated previously  the person (ality)  most times comes before
the person's work
hey  sure i want a piece of that pie       everyone does
but i want my work to get a bigger piece than i get  ( hopefully some of
it deserves a peak)

yes we are not mutually exclusive yet we are
after all didn't someone once say
i am not what i do    -
this applies to music to painting  to plumbing to astrology and astronomy


the stars                         the   stars                       the

when i was a kid i had the most romantic notions about
the Poetry Project.  having cut my teeth on Notley, Ceravolo,
and the like (thanks to a visit from Molly Russakoff to my
dirty little redneck town).  when i was in college a friend of
mine went to Warren Wilson for her MFA in creative writing,
and they had a reading at the Project, which i attended.  it
was the most depressing poetry reading of my life, just awful,
so awful that a rather drunk friend of mine who didn't want to
go in the first place said, "what the fuck is this, the housewives
from the Hamptons!"  it was one of those times where you want
to demand 2 hours of your life be returned.

it was so sad that it shattered my hopes of what the Project
was about.

until recently, that is.  since Anselm Berrigan has taken over
the Poetry Project has literally COME ALIVE, in every sense!
the best sense being the new blood injected.

the only thing "political" about him is to have poets like
Carol Mirakove read her political poems from her magnificent
new book Occupied.

poets like Peter Culley coming down from Canada to reissue
our sense that there are endless new frontiers in poetry to
be had.

poets like Greg Fuchs and Frank Sherlock, all this amazing
young talent we most likely would NOT have seen several
years before.

of course his mother read, why shouldn't she!?

if there's any elder poet MOST interested in recreating their
own work from book to book, it's her.  and she really, REALLY
listens to younger poets, welcomes our thoughts, our poems,
generous in her approach to encourage.  she's the real thing
as far as poets go!  and the Poetry Project should be treated
like her livingroom because of her generosity, whether her son
is in charge or not!  she's made it clear more than once that
there was a time she was made to feel unwelcome at the Project.

"We didn't feel welcome at the Poetry Project anymore. He writes
                        a lovely
poem about us as and watching Fred Astaire and Joan Leslie in
a less wellknown movie.  Can all this be to the point?"
     --Alice Notley, from Mysteries of Small Houses

all this said, it makes me very happy to go to readings at
the Project, something i didn't feel i'd ever feel after my first
visits some years ago.  Anselm Berrigan has brought an
electricity to the place that is undeniable, something you
experience and know how, among many things, it is the
spirit of Welcome you feel.

the sour grapes of the malcontent have no real gripe here.

I just remembered two other works of this kind.

Swedish writer and critic Peter Cornell, wrote a prose book in 1987
titled "Paradisets vagar" (Roads of Paradise), which consisted of
nothing but footnotes. The idea was that this was some sort of
treatise where the main text was lost.

as one of the older farts on this list ( I knw Anselm & Eddie B. since
they werelittle kids), the complaint about the PoProj exclusivity,
cronyism, etc. is not a new one. Actually, it was much fiercer a
generation ago, when some people thought there was an actual and real
inner circle that convened to decide who got what.

is there someplace out there that is a pure meritocracy? Certainly not
in academia, where I know of plenty of wandering adjuncts w/ strong
publishing, etc. who are considered damaged goods by folks w/ tenure
because they couldn't land a tenured
position atthe outset of their careers. And nothing at the Project
could the scandals a while back at the Academy of American Poetry,
where the chancellors seemed to psend their days handing out hugh
monetray awards to each other.

As a middle-aged, jersey-based poet, whose f/t job as a social worker
precludes much reading going/socializing, I'm well-aware that just
"being there" is sometimes just as valuable as "talent". However, the
project's history as fairly inclusive organization--perhaps the most
inclusive in NYC-- outweighs the natural outcome of normal social
interaction

peace

respects on the props and the pimps.

as for Wright, the amerikkkan propaganda is to play down the respect
offered to wright, outside of the plantation,  as a writer. Wright's
place in a tomb, only for great french literary figures, has been
dismissed infavour of it's location which is under the staires along
side with other famous french artists and genius exiles.

wright's mission did not fail:

wright achieved a goal, not usually experienced by black authors, even
in these days, he was not a novelty or a token or a typing monkey to be
placed in a (st)cage to do tricks for the collection of minstrel show
fanatics (come pimps calling themselves publishers) who don't share his
pigmentation and can't Cee the texture or feel the tone B.U.T. only tap
and clap along in ignorance...  a pigmentation aka a flava and texte
which the writing communities transform into a curse...richard wright
had become an author and in his death, despite the far reaching hands of
the haters of amerikkka who crack the whip in the publishing field he
escaped form from, he was honoured in "another country" for his work and
efforts.

...and to this day it is still played down in amerikkka

he will always be their boy...their black boy

to the world he is an author

Peace All,

I'd like to announce a few new Artist Showcase additions. Those into
poetry and experimental electronica will want to check "Unner Stated"
out. "Unner Stated" is by Hurricane Angel and features Lord Patch. Lord
Patch is a dub poet from Victoria, British Columbia,  Canada. He has
published respectable Literary works as well. "Soul Of Hip Hop" and
"Bluekron" have also posted a few new cuts. Remember the Artist Showcase
is self-published. So if you're an Artist, come shed some light on your
own work!!

While it may be true that the folks responding to your earlier
raising of issues about the Poetry Project misread your point, it's
nearly exactly NOT true that a non-profit arts organization receiving
public funding MUST present any work offered to them by the public. I
don't know specifically how the Poetry Project is organized and I
think I've only been to a reading there once. I don't live in NYC,
but I've worked for a lot of non-profit organizations & the system is
the same for all non-profits.

A non-profit organization has a mission statement approved by its
board of directors. It develops programming to serve that mission,
again approved by the board. It applies for public support for
specific programs by which it tries to serve this mission. If it
receives public funding for these programs and does what it says it
was going to do in the application for this support, then the
organization has fulfilled its obligations for the public funding.

The Poetry Project is no more or less of a public institution than
the reading series at the YMHA or for that matter, the Metropolitan
Museum of Art or the NY Philharmonic Orchestra, all of which receive
public funding.

Just because the Met receives public funding the curators don't have
to show visual art by

>rappers..academics...hamptons house wives...H.S.
>Eng Teachers...affirmative action babies...wandering
>jews...sons & mothers & husbands of famuz pos..
>infamuz & etc....haikuists... my aunt Lola...pageant
>press poets...& hollywood versifiers...to survive...

Just because the NY Phil receives public support they don't have to
perform music composed by

>rappers..academics...hamptons house wives...H.S.
>Eng Teachers...affirmative action babies...wandering
>jews...sons & mothers & husbands of famuz pos..
>infamuz & etc....haikuists... my aunt Lola...pageant
>press poets...& hollywood versifiers...to survive...

The Poetry Project may seem to be more public somehow because it's
folksier and downtown and has a particular history or whatever, but
the standards for public support are exactly the same as they are for
the Metropolitan Museum or the NY Philharmonic. It's got a mission,
it's got a board, and if the board approves the mission and approves
of how the organization is fulfilling the mission, and if the public
agencies approve applications for projects and are satisfied that the
projects are completed as initially described, then the organization
is doing what it should be doing.

No non-profit serves all constituencies. If the board and staff of
the Poetry Project don't have a problem with how they're implementing
the mission and policies of the organization, you can complain and
you can try to lobby the current board and/or try to get new members
on the board who agree with you. You can try to lobby public agencies
that support the organization, but if an organization is doing what
it says it will do in its application for support it is very, VERY
rare that a governmental entity will find any fault with the
organization.

Realistically, the best way to protest how you think an organization
is serving the public would be to start another organization that
does things differently.

But that'd be a lot harder than complaining.

Bests,

Herb

I disagree. Not every "public" project has to appeal to "all" of the
public. Locally, in Tucson, that would mean that mariachi festivals and
avant-garde music series and Kwanzaa projects and Native American youth
writing projects would all have to attract a widely inclusive public, even
the same widely inclusive public. It just doesn't work that way. Rather,
it's up to those who spend the public dollars to insure that all of the
public funding, in total, goes to projects that together have the kind of
wide appeal you are talking about. Niche organizations, serving the needs
of defined and limited communities, are perfectly fine as recipients of
public monies. This doesn't mean, of course, that they shouldn't always be
seeking ways of appealing to more people, but they really don't need to
reach "everyone" or anything close to that. If they did, every poetry
project would end up being alike. I'd rather have the Po Project define for
itself what it wants and needs to do, what it does best, and how to do
those things, and how to present their case for the merits of publicly
funding them -- and let the various funders decide if they are worthy of
such public funding.

(just after writing this I saw Herb Levy's excellent post about how
nonprofit organizations work -- thanks, Herb!)

Hi all,

The Poetry Project will be getting about ten percent of its income this year from public funds. Last year that figure was closer to twenty percent, twenty-two percent. The rest comes in through membership, admissions, workshop tuitions, donations, private foundations, fundraisers and occasional sales.

Total foundation money, public and private this year figures to cover about twenty-five-thirty percent of the Project's total costs, unless something unexpected comes through.

love,

the nepotist

hi CA and all,

i’ve been trying to steer clear of this thread, but I noticed in CA’s post the
following passage about going to a poproj reading in the past:

“it was so sad that it shattered my hopes of what the Project
was about.

”until recently, that is.  since Anselm Berrigan has taken over
the Poetry Project has literally COME ALIVE, in every sense!
the best sense being the new blood injected.”

now unless i’m wrong here, and if i am, apologies CA, the reading that
“shattered your hopes of what the Project was about” probably took place while
ed friedman was in charge of the poetry project. first off, when you disparage
any institution based upon one event it just isn't an accurate conclusion.

but to make it like anselm took a broken down arts organization and reinvented
it just isn’t the case. just off the top of my head, under ed the poproj over
the past decade saw curators like rachel levitsky, wanda phipps, tracie morris,
mitch highfill, regie cabico, and joanna fuhrman, to name just a few. hell,
anselm was a curator under ed, too. i think these are all people who’d feel as
welcome curating under the old project as under the new, don’t you?

as ever,
david

my blog, Tributary, ici: www.tribute-airy.blogspot.com. as an added
incentive to secure Poetics list members into my writing domain, I have
instituted a new and exciting program. in short, I plan to write about
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. and not just platitudinal creampuffs, but
discerning, useful commentary that will help (in my small way) to show
the world that you are every bit as intersting as you think you are.
it's true, isn't it? it is so with me. so keep checking out Tributary
often (I recommend three times a day, for that crucial comment centering
on you could happen at ANY TIME!!!).

my other blog is at www.Rocketsandsentries.blogspot.com. it is just
poetry and will not, alas, mention you. still...


yours terrifically, Allen Bramhall

The biggest thing we have to fear is four more years of George Bush 100%
publicly funded. Let's reduce it to Zero. Public Arts funding - given the
hellishly wonderful Bush led deficit - may or may not follow. But at least
something besides the increasingly sure prospects of a totally encompassing
Hell may follow. In either case poetry is going to have to do a lot of hard
work.

Fight the impending sense of sadness (outrage, etc.) Don't let suspect polls
pollute the public desire to vote. Encourage, insist that John Kerry put the
peddle to the metal.

Rob, Christophe, All:

There is also the fact that public monies exist for public usage. You don't
necessarily need non-profit status to procure public funds. Poets & Writers
(in NYC) provides funds to support readings, etc. NYFA (New York Foundation
for the Arts) provides funds directly to artists; poetry is one of the
funded categories this year and so-- if you live in NYS, consider applying.
The deadline is soon. Check the NYFA website for details.

The other piece about public funds that is worth considering is: at the
non-profit level, local funder level, most grant applications are reviewed
by a "panel review" process. While this process aims to be fair, in my
experience working with agencies funded by NYSCA (New York State Council on
the Arts) the grant apps are approved or denied by a panel  process hindered
by the totally subjective opinion of each individual panelist in regard tpo
how they read and "appreciate" work. The individual panelist comes complete
with their own aesthetic sensibilities (or lack thereof) and, in terms of
Lit., basically reads the entries and decides who they 'like' in relation to
the other applicants. The pile. Some work samples are 'stronger' than others
but some of this 'like' sits solely on the fulcrum of your particular
aesthetic bent.

If you want to be a part of this process, an agent of change, an advocate
for other than mainstream marketplace poetry, I encourage you to participate
in this process; entry into the game is pretty easy, feel free to b/c me for
specifics.

Long and short of it, I've sat upon many panels and was usually the lone
advocate for what I noticed 'going on' in someone's work. I.e., the lone
reader who got totally excited by some people's work and then had to listen
to it be sacked by the group. During one of these events, I was the lone
voice for poetry--another panelist argued that we should fund the fiction
entries over the poetry entries because poetry was  "so easy, I
mean..writing a novel is SO much WORK."  This is a direct quote. When I did
speak up, (since the panel process is built on consensus) some
people/panelists were able to at least see the strengths in an innovative or
experiemtal work sample even if it wasn't something they 'liked'. In several
cases, these people were funded or at least put into the 'maybe' pile
(instead of the 'NO WAY' pile) because works engaging new, alternate,
whatever formal choices had an advocate or someone to provide a context: me.

I think the grantmaking system is a joke in many instances, it has very
little to do with how "good" or "bad" your work is or you are--it can be
pretty arbitrary, this goes for foundation grantmaking, too. And there are
many many reasons for this, not just what I've outlined above. But if you
get involved....you can be part of making it more inclusive, not seriously
tilted toward pretty vanilla "popular verse culture" work. I'm sure panels
in NYC are more diverse, but in the great big rest of New York state (with
the exception of perhaps Buffalo), this was definitely not the case.

I've been part of the grantmaking (and getting) machine for years, in
different ways. If you want change--get involved! Speak up! We are
writers....no?

Finally, (I wasn't even going to speak up on this one because I found the
criticism to be so outrageous)---Anselm rocks. The Poetry Project rocks.
They, too, have to contend with fighting for funds in our Billy Collins
poetry culture. The situation in NYS was seriously sacked because of public
funds being severely slashed to clean up NYC after 9/11. Pataki raped the
already skinny arts coffer. Raped education funding too. Better for the Po
Project to hustle and persist than fold as many other arts organizations,
particularly in the field of arts projects for the public schools.

Sure, you can do it on your own, but you are also part of the "public." The
funds exist for everyone's potential use. Critique is easy. Guerrilla
cultural working is not. Mining the grantmakers cabinet for treasure is
everyone's right in our flimsy so-called 'democracy.'

Bravo to Anselm and everyone at the Poetry Project for the exteremely
difficult work of staying afloat, fiscally solvent, vital. It would be an
entirely different (and very sad) conversation in the past tense.
Fortunately for all of "us", including the great wide swath of public who
has yet to even hear of this work...fortunately for all of us the thing
still exists for scrutiny, celebration, or ridiculous complaints.

In light of this recent flap, I plan to send as big of a check as I am able
to the Poetry Project. Something others on this list might consider doing.
To tithe is a truly tangible thank you.

Ciao,

Jane

A sidetrack - does anyone remember a huge British CD-ROM released
some time in the late 80's or early 90's with all English poetry (or
at least all British poetry)? It was then sold - probably with
libraries as primary target, how they could afford it is a mystery -
for the unbelievable prize of something like 18 000 pounds ... I
wonder what happened to it. Could it be on sale for at least 17 000?

It=92s really sad to see ad hominem attacks surface again and again on this=
 list, especially when they=92re directed at someone like Anselm, who=92s o=
ne of best people I know on the poetry scene. And I say that solely as a ju=
dgment of his character, not of his literary pedigree, his position at the =
Poetry Project, or his abilities as a poet, all reasonable sources of jealo=
usy and easy targets for unreasonable and unreasoned attacks.

That said, this pointless rant reveals an alarming ignorance of what a job =
like Anselm=92s entails. Like most arts administrators, he spends the major=
ity of his working hours wondering how he is going to cover the next payrol=
l, the next electric bill, the next issue of the newsletter. He writes lett=
ers, he writes grants, he makes phone calls. He goes to board meetings and =
staff meetings. He writes more letters, more grants, and makes more phone c=
alls. He worries. A lot.

If he thinks at all about who=92s reading on a given night, it=92s only bec=
ause he takes pleasure in going to readings and wonders whether or not he c=
an make it, and weighs that against his desire to go home and not think abo=
ut the Poetry Project for a few hours.  It's not his job to cater to the de=
sires of every poet who wants to read to an audience. It's his job to make =
sure the money is there to have a reading series in the first place.

To make being at the center of the poetry scene even more enviable, every p=
oet in town analyzes his every move. Each one he -- or, most likely, the cu=
rrent curator of the reading series -- includes in the schedule is seen by =
a hundred other poets as an exclusion of them or worse, as a malicious publ=
ic denial of their genius. Or, in this case, as nepotism.

Then he goes home and tries to pursue his real career as a poet, which, he =
discovers, has little if anything to do with his day job, despite their pro=
ximity.

Meantime, all of his funders, public and private, annually reconsider wheth=
er or not the city even needs another literary organization.

I am sure he=92s losing more sleep about that than he is about this thread.=


Kudos, Anselm.

Let's face it...anyone who reads the Buff po list is an academic in a
certain sense, right...meaning you're not of the street and use a
computer fairly regularly...easy to forget that the majority of the
population of this planet is living in a ditch...but wait a minute even
the 'nonacademic' heroes of yesteryear became academic in later years,
right? you have to pay those bills...the fact of the matter...most all
art in the U.S. is forced to feed at the green trough to survive (and
someone told me the other day that NEA now falls under the umbrella of
Homeland Security, is that even true?)...the real nonacademics in my
mind were those that burnt out and died for it...Japanese surrealists
were locked up by 'thought police' ...the mere act of creating absurd
images was suspect and decadent...but even that enfant terrible image
of the stereotypical loner poet...has been tainted by the pop culture
machine...who are the nonconformists now? an organic farmer from a
family of accountants? vice versa?...the question itself is faulty, I
guess..the unacknowledged legislators of the world seem fairly
acknowledged now...some do anyway...can't fault New York City for
being...can't compare it to San Francisco, Chicago or any other
city...I agree that folks need to generate their own readings series,
publications, sites, tho...somebody overheard in convo..."my whole
goddamned life is a poetry project"

what's to stop anyone from publishing anything? the Po Project is an
icon, but I don't have some romantic idea of it...I've read thousands
of submissions and have mainly sustained my publishing venture via the
Internet...in that sense it doesn't matter anymore where you hail
from...re: submissions I do admit that the quality level, of course,
isn't always there, but it'd be the same if I read the slush pile for
the Paris Review...it is funny though how those certain addresses have
that luster, right? somebody from fairborn, ohio versus somebody from
NYC...I'm personally glad to see people such as Dana Ward reading
alongside others who may be more recognizable regulars to that
scene...bravo...at some point bring on the next generation...they have
to make their own mistakes...Chicago has a vibrant reading scene and
publications with writing as good to be found anywhere...as Mr. Bianchi
will attest

OK. I'm facing it, but I don't see what you see

that's stretching the meaning of "academic" beyond the limit

classifying people as "academic" because they read the Buff po list and then
using the word "academc" when you mean "readers of the Buff po list" is a
bit off

I am put in mind of market surveys where saying "I don't accept the terms of
your question" gets you classified "don't know"

(disacademic)

not of the street? i'm a bit confused as to what you're getting at...

do we have to start flashing our 'street cred' in order to not be considered
an 'academic'? if so, i've got a laundry list of 'of the street' things i
can show you...

Lawrence Sawyer, i can only speak for myself here, but
we're not all academics on this list.

i have a computer because a friend didn't need it.
i'm working for $8 an hour and my fucking feet are killing
me and i can't afford to get fucking sick or die!  i have
no insurance, none!  i was the first person in my family
to go to college and i was thrown out long before i could
complete my degree.  i'm always on the verge of not
being able to pay my rent and electric.

i HATE being poor!
there's probably NOTHING worse!
i lived in a car for half a year with my mother as a kid
and it was awful!  these are facts, and i'm only sharing
them because i'm not interested in becoming invisible
for you so you can make your point!

i love poetry and i don't have to be anyone but who i am
in order to love it!

and if you're an academic and love poetry, well hello,
glad to meet you!  whatever!  we're all in this together!
i'm not angry at anyone for opportunities i didn't have.
poetry helped me find that.

CAConrad!

Lawrence,

I agree with the recent posts that you are stretching the definition of
"academic" to the point of absurdity. I hope that everyone continued to
read past that, because the rest of your post was spot-on.

Hello:

Enjoying the list as an observer up to this point. Hopefully, I can
add something to the future conversation. In the meanwhile, I continue
to build up my stamina...

I assemble "Wieldy," accepting modern poetry submissions in all forms,
which is a on-going collection of poetry. Send your poetry in the body
of an e-mail to: <bmarcacci@gmail.com>. No attachments, please.

Recently moved to Beijing, I believe most of my internet problems are
behind me for the time being. Did you know that blogs are not entirely
popular in China? *coughs* Nevertheless, I would like to display more
than one new poem a month...

Thank you and I look forward to reading your work!

nice but sorry to burst that bubble  not an academic in any sense
not saying i'm proud of that
more endemic but not like a disease i hope tho most of the time very ill
at ease
oh if a bit of night college in brooklyn counts
then hey i'm your man

& sure i've read a few books
& yes i steal my knowledge like everyone else

beg borrow  learn  teach   self- auto didact crumble
bldings
falling  saw them from my corner
where'd that come from oh the second mind
the 3rd ear
spontaneous bop prosody
heart  words spelled backwards
pigeons that look like hawks
& yes
the street

dr n now he's an academic
but he practically lives on the street
i envy him his brains
but tell him constantly that he's stupid
& that a mind is a terrible thing to waste

oh and he and i have a terrible relationship
sort of like the occupied territories
or pinter's servant
or  geez  what am i saying  i gotta get to work on my nyfa grant

To All and To Anselm Berrigan,

This weird back handed dissing has to cease y disist, including the word
"pedigree."  A person is not a dog.  Anselm Berrigan is the right person for
the job, and it's not a pleasant job right now, scrounging more than ever for
money in the rare mushroom forest of grants.  Those who have made inuuendos
might sit for five minutes silently and conjure empathy for the incredibly
awful job of trying to extract funds to keep our work going publically in a
political environment that is antagonistic to language.

Thanks for the shout out, Charles, but you deserve equal credit for
making it clear why a public agency can justify funding organizations
that serve subsets of a community if they support a variety of
organizations that serve diverse constituencies.

Hi Jonathan

Thanks for yours. I thought our personal pronouns are taking some strain
with 2 of us having the same first name,,,

I read to the end of Laurence Sawyer's post... How spot on he is re USA, and
a large part of the post is specifically about USA, it is not my place to
judge. I can only look at the words and the argument as argument.

We, you and I anyway, are agreed that the meaning of "academic" has been
stretched... When LS goes on to say that _even the 'nonacademic' heroes of
yesteryear became academic in later years, right?_, I am inclined to say
_maybe_ because I am not sure how "academic" is being used. I suspect the
meaning is being stretched still, but perhaps in new directions

Of whom are we speaking? Whose heroes? When the meaning of "academic" has
been stretched, we can hardly connotatively label anyone with it just
because they took a college job.

Paying bills is always a problem; but there are many other ways of
achieiving that, most of them demeaning and corrosive in some way, sooner or
later, at least over here.

Being burnt out seems to be a high price to deserve the label _real
non-academic_. Not every society has a thought police, not all the time; and
those who live in temporarily freer societies are fortunate. I don't think
that they are rendered less authentic by the freedom of their political
regimes.

I am not entirely sure what is meant by _that enfant terrible image of the
stereotypical loner poet_; but if it has been _tainted by the pop culture
machine_ then that is part of the process of the pop culture machine. A real
poet is not necessarily tainted thereby unless they knowingly go into it.

What is this taint? Is it in the original image or the original person? Or
in a superimposition upon an image?

I think that noncomformity follows from the poetry, not the other way
around. Using nonconformity as a test of poetry leads astray unless one is
only interested in behaviour style

("There is no audience, only social classes")
        --parenthetical remark by Straub

It's inadequate to the problem to state: If you try to speak to the
Americans in their own language, in their own space, they will beat you
up. Nobody has said that, not exactly. There's even the threat of
violence, perhaps, by superimposing an allusion to the Fight Club onto
the verbal exchange one may well imagine developing if a foreign guest
spoke to an audience standing in for the national poetry about Lowell
and Pound. What reading is that which would be capable of locating
Lowell anywhere near the fate of the artist in America etc. today? All
the pressure and prestige of the orthodoxy of the new and its immense
cultural capital militates against leaving the least space open for any
return to this toppled monument of the old order.

But what happens to poetry, anyone's poetry, when it moves across
borders, languages? That early Catholicism of Lowell's, for example,
would it reverberate differently, read through another language
saturated with the signage of Rome? Once across borders, which tradition
does a poetry enter, whose national poetry does it belong to? For this
kind of question to be able to be posed, there would have to be some
form of sensitivity along the lines of Bourdieu's 1991 remark at the
Institute of Contemporary Arts, London: "Through the concept of symbolic
violence I try to make visible an unperceived form of everyday violence.
For example, here in this auditorium now I feel very shy; I am anxious
and have difficulty formulating my thoughts. I am under a strong form of
symbolic violence which is related to the fact that the language is not
mine and I don't feel at ease in front of this audience."

At the toleration conference in Tomsk the organizers imposed as a
condition of participation that everyone speak in English even though
the conference papers were published and translated into Russian. This
requirement of speaking in the language of the foreign guests resulted
in the broken English of Galina Petrova, a senior member on the
philosophy faculty whose elegant Russian I'd heard two years before in
Yurga and whose paper in a session the following morning ended with a
quotation from Jean Luc Nancy, submitting to the domination of the
academic from Lancaster's Center for European Thought, who answered her
question about the alternatives to toleration this way: "I don't
understand you. Can you repeat the question?" In the obvious sense, such
incidents remind one of the global prestige of English and the
willingness of speakers of other languages to submit to it, but there's
another more difficult perception that, for intellectuals that have
undergone the experience of institutional domination and situations of
real violence, called to account by extremely determinate
responsibilities before socio-political and ideological bodies of a
Zhadovian type, there may as well be a willingness to suspend one's
ability to articulate one's ideas in recognition of the necessity of
exchange with the foreigner, so that, no matter how poorly you speak his
or her language, you do not humiliate them by imposing the condition
that they speak your own.

A further question wonders at the violence of the reaction, if there was
such a reaction, against the gesture towards including Lowell in the
cultural history of the national poetry (the French academic Chenetier
mentioning last week in Lodz someone's dissertation on Howe and Plath at
whatever university in Paris he is). What closure would such violence of
disagreement and, even, censure, as one might imagine, be substituting
for? Without entirely re-opening Benjamin's essay on Goethe, remembering
for now only one of the arguments there, that Goethe so completely
embedded himself within the patronage system that the work was
compromised, historically compromised, and it could not intervene in a
time of social and cultural crisis (though one would have to include in
consideration of this problem, "The Need to Take the Mediating Character
of Bourgeois Writing Seriously)", could the figure of Goethe be
proposed, in analogy, for a contemporary configuration in the U.S. that
calls itself New or new enough at least to provoke contestatory violence
towards the foreign guest ("Note: In the upper half of the card, on the
front, in each box, the fingers should be rotated. In the lower half--in
the boxes under the title 'Check Print'--the nonrotated prints of the
four fingers of each hand without the thumbs are placed...") committing
the sin of ignorance by confusing the old order with the new?

Hi,

As someone who's tried to help run a (localised)poetry body this side of
the pond, I sympathise with Anselm.  Even worse, Anselm seems to be at the
helm of a vessel with a *large* visibility. One cannot please all the
people all the time, as I found to my cost.

Big up, Anselm. Don't let them grind you down...

Roger

Difficult Loves
        by John Palattella

It wasn't until 1996, when President Bill Clinton declared April to be National
Poetry Month, that the eminent translator and poet Richard Howard truly grasped
the significance of the opening words of T.S. Eliot's *The Waste Land*, "April is the
cruelest month." "At last we have succeeded in wreaking on poetry what the worst
excesses of Progressive Education and the Palmer Method were helpless to effect:
We have ghettoized a millennial human expression previously conceived as a pervasive
part of conscious life," Howard declared at a PEN awards ceremony that May. "If
we are to save poetry," he insisted, we must restore it "to that status of seclusion and
even secrecy that characterizes only our authentic pleasures and identifies only our
intimately valued actions." Robert Pinsky, then the poet laureate of the United States,
disagreed. "Poetry is part of our shared communal life, as surely as is the Internet,"
Pinsky wrote in a defense of National Poetry Month published in the *New York Times*.
Pinsky's observation is true, although with the adjective "shared" he seemed to want to
draw a veil over some pesky questions. If poetry is integral to communal life, why must
we be reminded of that fact every April, with all the labored cheerleading and hectic
marketing of a big church holiday? Is poetry meaningfully involved in cultural life only
if it preoccupies us in the same way as the Internet? Pinsky's genial tone of
accommodation softened Howard's abrasiveness, but not the force of Howard's point.

Dana Gioia, the chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), has pitched
his tent in Pinsky's camp. In *Disappearing Ink*, Gioia laments that no American poet
today has achieved the kind of fame and influence with a popular audience that Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow enjoyed in the nineteenth century. The work of most contemporary
poets is culturally marginal, and for Gioia marginality is an artistic dead end. But poets
can return to public prominence and revitalize their art, Gioia claims in his book's title essay,
if they follow the lead of rappers, cowboy poets and poetry slammers. The emergence of
electronic media like television and the Internet, he says, borrowing heavily from Marshall
McLuhan's theories about media, has "slightly readjust[ed] the contemporary sensibility in
favor of sound and orality." Rappers and slammers embody this readjusted sensibility
because they compose for the ear and transmit their verse through performance. Roland
Barthes reveled in the death of the author; Gioia rejoices in the death of the text. "American
culture conditioned by electronic media and a celebrity culture based on personalities has
given birth to a new kind of author," he proclaims: "the amplified bard."

In July the NEA released "Reading at Risk," a report lamenting the precipitate decline of
literary reading in the face of electronic media over the past two decades. Why, then, in
*Disappearing Ink* would its chairman extol poets and audiences who forgo the book for
the amp? Equally perplexing is Gioia's claim that the popularity of poetry readings among
"literary" poets who still compose for the page signals the emergence of a vibrant oral culture.
There's a more persuasive claim to be made about such literary readings: They are less an
oral alternative to print culture than a commercial adjunct of it, a way for poets to promote
new books in a marketplace where reviews and advertisements of poetry are rare. Nor is
there a lock-and-key fit between the Internet and orality, as Gioia implies. For the past few
years some poets have approached Google as a *détournement* machine, using the search
function as a phrase generator and assembling the results into cut-up poems. (In some circles
the method and poems go by the name of "flarf.") As bewildering or irritating as spam, this
work is defiantly typographic and can be downright impossible to read aloud, amplified or
not.

But what do I know? I'm the kind of critic who Gioia complains is ill equipped to assess
innovations in contemporary poetry because my tastes are based in part on the "antiquarian
assumptions" of Modernism, which "reflect a culture without radio, talking films, television,
videocassettes, computers, cell phones, satellite dishes, and the Internet." If media harmony
between a critic's era and that of his subject is the basis of critical judgment, then Gioia's
enthusiasm in *Disappearing Ink* for Robert Frost, Elizabeth Bishop and Jack Spicer, all of
whom made do with pens or typewriters, is peculiar indeed.

Such contradictions pile up in Gioia's essays because Gioia is a critic who needs antagonisms
to justify his enthusiasms. His preferred approach is the American *Kulturkampf* of the people
clashing with a treacherous elite. In *Disappearing Ink*, Gioia worries that because of the
lingering influence of literary poetry's elite and antiquated conventions, which favor composition
the page instead of the stage, poetry risks being crushed by more popular media like the Internet.
Similarly, more than ten years ago in the title piece of *Can Poetry Matter?* Gioia claimed that
poetry was no longer part of the mainstream of artistic and intellectual life, a state of affairs he
attributed to the elitism of creative writing programs. In that same book, however, he recycled
the argument of Edmund Wilson's 1934 essay "Is Verse a Dying Technique?," in which Wilson
contends that since the late eighteenth century the refinement of the lyric has led poets to forsake
history and satire as suitable subjects, thereby diminishing poetry's popular appeal. If that's true,
then those elite creative writing programs are not the cause but merely the most recent symptom
of a rot that set in more than two centuries ago. In both *Can Poetry Matter?* and *Disappearing
Ink*, a tendency to offer foregone conclusions instead of genuine arguments makes it easier for
Gioia to reassure readers that poetry can regain its cultural prominence if it escapes the clutches
of writing programs or absorbs the oral characteristics of electronic media. This style of
argumentation is aided by Gioia's polite but pushy essayistic style, one that, for all its apparent
specificity, is essentially general and vague.

Such are the tricks critics contrive when they try to exaggerate poetry's cultural prominence. In his
intelligent, elegant and valuable defense of poetry, James Longenbach emphasizes what poets gain
by not being subject to the pressures of a high-stakes market or mediascape. "It's difficult to
complain about poetry's expanding audience," Longenbach says, taking up Richard Howard's
argument without his caustic tone, "but it's more difficult to ask what a culture that wants poetry to
be popular wants poetry to be. The audience has by and large been purchased at the cost of poetry's
inwardness: its strangeness, its propensity to defeat its own expectations." In Gioia's eyes, a poet
who avoids a mass audience is almost by definition arrogant, but for Longenbach such avoidance
"could also be liberating--the creation of a space in which a poem may be pushed to extremes the
culture wouldn't know how to purchase or ignore." After all, it is because Emily Dickinson refused
to cleanse her poems of their unorthodox rhythms and rhymes, thereby preserving a "status of
seclusion and secrecy," that she and her poems are now so well-known. Poems claim our
attention, Longenbach argues, inasmuch as they effectively resist it.

In nine lucid chapters written in a style often as supple as the poems discussed, Longenbach
examines what he calls techniques of poetic self-resistance: the formal tool kit (line, syntax, metaphor,
voice, disjunction) that poets use to question their own convictions, working by glimmers and glints
instead of tidy sums. Longenbach's approach is deceptively simple. He scrutinizes poetry's formal
qualities, but he is not a formalist in the conventional sense of being ahistorical. Discussing a wide
range of work but focusing mostly on modern poems, Longenbach is careful to explain how a
poem's omission of historical content is not necessarily a repression of historical knowledge. The
historical texture of a poem may be measured by its formal dynamics more than the weight
of its content, as in Michael Palmer's "Seven Poems Within a Matrix of War," a sequence of poems
concerning the first Gulf War, or Wallace Stevens's "Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction," written
during the early years of the Second World War.

Equally provocative is Longenbach's defense of poetic language. In order to promote poetry in an
indifferent culture, champions of poetry often try to define the mystical difference of poetic language
from ordinary language. Longenbach does the opposite, stressing what the two languages have in
common. Poems exploit rather than suppress the slippages of ordinary language, he explains,
and what demands our attention is how a poet makes the ineradicable ambiguities of ordinary
language uniquely adequate to the subject a poem must express. Or, to borrow a notion from Peter
Gizzi's "Ding Repair," what demands our attention is how poetic language unfolds into meaning,
ordinary and rare each time:

                        A hummingbird at the scarlet bell works the vine.
                        Even as adults we hope to witness ordinary spectacle
                        evolve into meaning, ordinary and rare each time
                        the ribbon, the wave--all bent.
                        For if those memos, phone calls, holidays
                        were to accrue then where would we be?

Longenbach says that the resistance to poetry is the wonder of poetry, "the reinvention of humility,"
a formulation that calls to mind the romantic poet John Keats's description of negative capability as
the ability of a poet to be "in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact
& reason." But Longenbach's wonder more closely resembles Adam Zagajewski's notion of ardor.
The fourth essay collection by Zagajewski to be translated into English, *A Defense of Ardor* contains
appreciations of and quarrels with writers, painters and philosophers. Written with his characteristic
delicacy, gravity and wit, the book is notable for the acute, thoughtful way that the Polish poet frames
and examines literary and intellectual issues. Zagajewski craves ardor after reading Tzvetan Todorov's
essay on Dutch still-life painting, "In Praise of the Quotidian," which Zagajewski attacks for suggesting
that artists must become "deft miniaturists" immune to moments of experience that are "incomprehensible
and piercing, both extravagant and absolutely fundamental." Yet Zagajewski also craves ardor after
reading E.M. Cioran's *Notebooks*, an "uncommonly irritating" work in which Cioran's extreme
narcissism fuels scabrous rants against quotidian life. Zagajewski finds the residue of ardor in Plato's
concept of metaxu, the state of being "incurably en route," and he finds ardor flourishing in the climate
of thought cultivated by the painter Jozef Czapski and the poets Czeslaw Milosz and Zbigniew Herbert,
who "answered history's menace in universal, not provincial ways. And they touched profound hopes
while shunning easy consolations."

Longenbach also thinks wonder arises from shunning easy consolations, but the roots of his notion of
wonder stretch deeply into a uniquely American and pragmatic source, one running from Emily
Dickinson ("In insecurity to lie/is Joy's insuring quality") through Wallace Stevens and George Oppen to
John Ashbery. These are poets who love flux, who build elaborate metaphors while simultaneously
warning of their collapse, whose poems ride on linguistic sliding, whose voices speak because they are
shattered. They are playfully serious poets who work hard to foreground the infinitely repeatable work
of interpretation and knowing. And their work isn't without hazards. "If the resistance to poetry is the
wonder of poetry," Longenbach asks, "how do we prevent resistance from becoming a fetish, something
with which we are merely fascinated?" By reminding ourselves constantly that "the power of a poem
inheres in the realization that we cannot count on it." No matter how graceful its language, no matter how
resourcefully it mines the ambiguities of ordinary language, a poem can never obviate the pressures of the
ordinary world because a poem's consolation, knitted from figurative language, will unravel and slip away.
Or not.

Early in his book Longenbach invokes the example of Callimachus, the ancient Greek poet who refused
the Homeric challenge of writing an epic, preferring instead to write love poems and elegies. Callimachus
was scorned by his peers for ignoring his civic duties and thereby diminishing the possibilities for poetry.
Longenbach draws a different lesson from Callimachus's choice: It was only because Callimachus was
acutely suspicious about the nature of poetic ambition that he could force his best discoveries against the
walls of his own ambition's limitations. That example informs the most incisive essays of Carl Phillips's
*Coin of the Realm* as well, although the straw men that shamble through the book sometimes elbow
Callimachus aside. Phillips has a tendency to carp about younger poets' suspicions about exercising
authority without explaining exactly what he means, and his single-mindedness about this issue cuts
deeply against the poetics he elaborates in his book.

The ghost of Callimachus enters the picture when Phillips discusses the poetry of the seventeenth-century
Protestant pastor George Herbert, who chose to wrestle with an epic subject, the perplexing ways of
God to man ("why affliction?--why, inevitably, our suffering?"), in the narrow confines of the intricate
lyric poems of *The Temple*. "Herbert persuades by the very thing with which his poems are so
frequently ill at ease: his flawed self," Phillips claims. "It is not so much that he admits to flaw...but that he
brings flaw into view as instructive example." Phillips is a poet with seven books to his name, and the
relentless deliberation he finds in Herbert's lyrics quickens his own work too. "Phillips is not discouraged
but enthralled by this state of perpetually suspended rediscovery," Longenbach writes in *The Resistance
to Poetry*. "He wants the world to be difficult to see because our understanding leaps too quickly from
the *choice* to the *chosen*, from what is *findable* to what is *found*." But what's different about
Phillips's portrait of Herbert's deliberation is its spiritual hue. Without relentless deliberation, Phillips
implies, there can be no desire and surrender; without desire and surrender there can be no faith; and
without faith there can be no relentless deliberation.

The poems of Herbert's that Phillips discusses were composed as a private confession of the desire for
an incomprehensible and piercing kind of knowledge. That gesture of inwardness is about as far as one can
get from the very public arena of the Internet--or, to use Gioia's lingo, from today's auditory avant-garde.
Not unlike Herbert's poems, Longenbach's and Zagajewski's defenses of poetry, along with Phillips's best
essays, are rich and rewarding proof that the will to believe passionately in the fictions of poetry is not
always hostage to the salvation schemes of the overchurched and the intellectually naïve.

Byron on Keats:

who was invited or not and why? poets have been
pissing about being left out of this or that
"scene" probably since homer sat down on a rock a
few yards closer to Sparta than Delos, or some
such bullshit. come on!

while it's undeniable that anyone living in NYC is
bound to get more attention and have more
opportunity (to publish, to read, and to have
those publications read and readings attended)
than someone living in Tubuka, Kansas, it's not
going to matter one whit in the long run where you
read or didn't read and who was there to hear it.
ego, ego, ego. get over it. if you love poetry and
are doing good work it will be found and read, by
someone, eventually.

I live in san francisco partially because there is
such a large community here and so much
opportunity to study and learn and exchange with
my peers. I'm not going to lie and say that it's
all been a positive experience in that respect or
that there aren't cliques and etc. but in that
time I've gotten to study with some fantastic
poets and befriended many more. the worst
side-effect of trying to be a poet or any kind of
artist though is this paranoia that has absolutely
nothing to do with the actual work. "stand whoso
list on slipper-top" and so on...

And please don't let's go there with the academic
vs. nonacademic poet argument again! It didn't do
keats or byron any good 200 years ago and it holds
no more water now.

Subject: Re: a little offensive about the poetry
project

when i was a kid i had the most romantic notions
about the Poetry Project.  having cut my teeth on
Notley, Ceravolo, and the like (thanks to a visit
from Molly Russakoff to my dirty little redneck
town).  when i was in college a friend of mine
went to Warren Wilson for her MFA in creative
writing, and they had a reading at the Project,
which i attended.  it was the most depressing
poetry reading of my life, just awful, so awful
that a rather drunk friend of mine who didn't want
to go in the first place said, "what the fuck is
this, the housewives from the Hamptons!"  it was
one of those times where you want to demand 2
hours of your life be returned.

it was so sad that it shattered my hopes of what
the Project was about.

until recently, that is.  since Anselm Berrigan
has taken over the Poetry Project has literally
COME ALIVE, in every sense!
the best sense being the new blood injected.

the only thing "political" about him is to have
poets like Carol Mirakove read her political poems
from her magnificent new book Occupied.

poets like Peter Culley coming down from Canada to
reissue our sense that there are endless new
frontiers in poetry to be had.

poets like Greg Fuchs and Frank Sherlock, all this
amazing young talent we most likely would NOT have
seen several years before.

of course his mother read, why shouldn't she!?

if there's any elder poet MOST interested in
recreating their own work from book to book, it's
her.  and she really, REALLY listens to younger
poets, welcomes our thoughts, our poems, generous
in her approach to encourage.  she's the real
thing as far as poets go!  and the Poetry Project
should be treated like her livingroom because of
her generosity, whether her son is in charge or
not!  she's made it clear more than once that
there was a time she was made to feel unwelcome at
the Project.

"We didn't feel welcome at the Poetry Project
anymore. He writes
                        a lovely
poem about us as and watching Fred Astaire and
Joan Leslie in a less wellknown movie.  Can all
this be to the point?"
     --Alice Notley, from Mysteries of Small
Houses

all this said, it makes me very happy to go to
readings at the Project, something i didn't feel
i'd ever feel after my first visits some years
ago.  Anselm Berrigan has brought an electricity
to the place that is undeniable, something you
experience and know how, among many things, it is
the spirit of Welcome you feel.

the sour grapes of the malcontent have no real
gripe here.

Dear Buffaloes,

Instead of "academic" why don't people try other words.  How about
"intellectual" or "writer."  There are all sorts of "intellectuals," and
Gramsci even coined the term "organic intellectuals" for people tightly
bound to the working class.

I work at a university.  That makes me an academic.  Most people who teach
at universities are "intellectuals," but not all.  A few are even "organic
intellectuals," despite working in higher education.  Many are "writers,"
and even the engineers need to write.  Few write poetry or fiction
(although some start late in life: Renaldo Rosaldo, anthropologist, started
up after having a stroke and just received an American Book Award, an
"organic poet").  I steer away from teaching "Creative Writing," so I teach
anything else -- which I call "Uncreative Writing."  Once you cross over to
"Uncreative Writing," the possibilities are endless.

Don't disparage academics.  We will get arrested and taken to the camps
with the other intellectuals.

I suggest that you leave Anselm and the Poetry Project alone as well.  Many
of us will flee into St. Marks Church and cry for sanctuary.  Many of us
have been doing that for decades.  Send money to the Poetry Project!

Make your own sanctuary.  Do your own work.  Expand the definitions or
discard them.  Critique ideas and the products of art with energy.  But
keep working and helping others to do their work.

I'm not chiming in about the Poetry Project.

I am chiming in about the word "academic."  It is applied in slam / open
reading circles to poets who've graduated from college.

Interesting. It used to apply (and still does in my brain) to descendants
of Auden and Ransom, and to the likes of Lowell, Bishop, Merrill and their
children, as opposed to the New American Poetry and its offspring.
Regardless of who worked in universities.

That's funny. Where I come from, slammers fall all over themselves to prove
how underground they are, regardless of their education level. I'm not sure
I'd apply the word to graduates, but to teachers, certainly, regardless of
style or philosophy.

The word "academic" does not convey a single institution, any sort of
clique, or even a mindset. The word's usefulness as a symbol of oppression
is long-since past. In short, the only people sillier than poets who still
append the letters "PhD" to their name when off campus are those poets who
judge their worth as authors by how much boozin' and whorin' they've done.

Subject:      Bush on loving women (with apologies to King David)
Comments: cc: L-Poconater@lists.psu.edu

it was only a few weeks back that President Bush, during a campaign appearance
in Missouri, complained that Ob/Gyn doctors aren't being allowed to "practice
their love of women."

Now, in tonight's debate (the most memorable moment for me, though evidently not
for the good folk at the TV networks), Bush, while talking about the widow of a
US soldier who'd been killed in Iraq, said (and this IS FROM THE TAPE people):

"You know, it's hard work to try to love her as best as I can knowing full well
that the decision I made caused her husband to be in harm's way."

well, I guess maybe it would be easier work to love her under different
circumstances.  we'll have to ask Laura to explain.
