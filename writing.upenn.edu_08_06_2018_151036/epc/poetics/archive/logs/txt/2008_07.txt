Are you talking about me, or just projecting here? I try to have a discussi=
on about the art of poetry, and I get accusations (often false), mere rheto=
ric, attempts at pissing matches, superficial claptrap, etc. Not from every=
one, to be sure. There are a few who have actually carried on an intellectu=
al discussion on poetry. Those who suspect I may be right, but find that po=
ssibility to be inconvenient to whatever it is they are producing end up wi=
th this kind of dribble. =0A=0AI've been accused of wanting to go back to t=
he "stink of the 19th century." I've never talked about the 19th century. H=
owever, I have not seen any kind of argument for why it stinks. Is it becau=
se so many were bestsellers and were better poets on their worst days than =
most of us have ever been on our best? Still, it's not the 19th century I'v=
e talked about. In fact, I have only mentioned, a few discussion threads ag=
o, one poet from the last 400 years, and that was Frederick Turner, who is =
very much alive and a poet of the late 20th and now early 21st century. Spe=
aking of contemporary poets, one could also mention Frederick Fierstein, Pa=
ul Lake, and R. S. Gwynn. Of the Modernists, I love Robert Frost and especi=
ally Wallace Stevens. The intellectual in me loves the French surrealists a=
nd Apollinaire. It is certainly that I don't like much of what the Modernis=
ts especially have done -- I just recognize too that much of what they did =
worked to marginalize
 poetry. Part of that marginalization was in direct response to movies and,=
 later, T.V. -- to modern culture. One of the consequences of this was the =
audience for poetry shrunk. But, then, so did the audience for operas, play=
s, and symphonies -- especially the Modern and Postmodern works that came a=
bout. =0A=0ANow, while I did say that beauty reproduces itself, I should ha=
ve also said that so do viruses. What our English teachers and professors h=
ave done to the students in this country have made them susceptible to infe=
ction.=0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=0A=0A----- Original Message ----=0AFrom: Paul N=

=0ASo if you're after LOGIC in poetry, you can swing back to the stink of t=
he 19th century, as Michael Ford put it. Fortunately, there are those (the =
vast majority on this list) who want a DEEPER gesture than what certain Doc=
tors from Texas are capable of appreciating and that's why this list exists=
..=0A=0AThere have been a couple of movements since the romantic era that so=
ught to make art more relevant to the times. We see where intellect gets us=
 and the Doctor from Texas exemplifies it to perfection. The hastily-writte=
n put down. The intellectual pissing match. The desire to prove one's self =
right at the expense of another. It is a clear demonstration of the competi=
tion/domination cosmology, one whose time passed long ago, but still clings=
 on   and on. =0A=0AJack Spicer said =0A=0A=0A=85Prose invents -=0Apoetry d=

ut Spicer's is, of course an ethos based in 1950's consciousness, albeit wa=

nce 1850, in poetry anyway, so these kinds of notions will be attacked by s=

The moderators have asked me to justify sending the monthly link to my =
one-year blog to the Poetics list, which is understandable. The =
explanation is in the introduction:

This is a one-year log of thoughts pondered, dreams exposed, of books, =
essays, poems, with photographs, whole or collaged, carried forth by =
conjoining what's happening in my life with the life of the planet. In =
essence, it is what neo-Jungian theorist Susan Rowland calls, "reading =
reality aesthetically." It is also a form of travel writing rarely =
leaving home, in the sense of Peter Bishop's, "Travel writing creates =
worlds, not simply discovers them."

The project's central purpose is to relocate the literary tradition in a =
medium that craves flashy images, pop-ups, etc., as a phase in the =
development of Digital Literary Art, linking new transmissions to old =
libraries, inside and out.

I'm wondering if Logan has gotten tired iof wiping the floor with C.K.
Williams, Adrienne Rich, Franz Wright and Jorie Graham and is now turning
his blunderbuss against poets held dear by the alternative communities
(Crane and O'Hara). His tone is not unlike that of Yvor Winters when he took
on poets like Edna St. Vincent Millay and Robinson Jeffers (Winters so
disliked Jeffers that he he came back for seconds in another review) during
the heyday of High Modernism.Winters was at least of his time, Logan just
comes off as critic sent forward from the past in the Wayback Machine

Yes, especially in regards to your argument for poetry of/for the
masses and for the past glories of lyrical poetry. I strongly suggest
you become aware of the connection :)

I think a discussion of poetics should be towards innovation and
further subjectivity, to encourage art by and for the individual. The
individual is far more suited, even when educated, to chose from a
rich and diverse offering, especially on this newfangled "internets."

"First of all, an insistent reference to the West and to "Western
Civilization," a theme or lexicon whose careless manipulation has
often slid over into rather undemocratic theses, as we know now from
experience, especially when it is a question of a "decadence" of the
said Western Civilization. As soon as anyone talks about "decadence of
Western Civilization," I am on my guard. We know that this kind of
talk can sometimes (not always) lead to restorations or installations
of an authoritarian, even totalitarian order." (Jacques Derrida, "Like
the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell: Paul de Man's
War")http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/joris/heideggerfascism.html

an essay on JH Prynne in both written and mp3 format by David Caddy, British
poet, editor and critic.

http://davidcaddy.blogspot.com/2008/06/letter-14.html

(re Caddy's comments on exile--
something stumbled on the other day referenced by some one else--
and old note sent to this list five years ago--
writing of how since 9/11 esp the sense of answering the forms which ask for
"occupation"--
one writes "writer/artist"
"occupation" as working "under occupation"
in the "Homeland"--
a place ever more Occupied by forces both stridently and subtly antithetical
to "freedom," "free speech," "difference" and "questioning authorities"--
so it is that in this very good article the ideas of "exile" i think are far
too narrow and need to be extended throughout the world--
to include writers of exiles from genocides and ethnic cleansings in Africa,
Latin America, Palestine, former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Armenia,
Cambodia--
and inside the USA--the "internal refugees" of Katrina and the reservations,
ghettos, rural poverty--
"internal exiles" of America's Holocaust living in "Occupied Territories"--
here in Milwaukee is the US' only Black Holocaust Museum to bring greater
awareness to this extension and inclusiveness of the questions and meanings
of exiles,exterminations, enslavements--
otherwise the vanishings of peoples in itself is vanished and even their
bones and ghosts disappeared into the "Heart of Darkness"--
for example in Conrad's time, over ten million people were killed by the
Belgians in the Congo in less than fifteen years--and millions more
permanently crippled, tortured, died of disease and hunger--and in the first
years of the 21st Century, 4.5 million persons in the Congo  have been
slaughtered--
in a daily increasingly Panopticonic and Internet World Wide Web planet--
the Cinema of catharsis is heavily edited, and the areas which are exposed
to lighs, camera, action--selected and controlled--
those in the areas not so well lit, not so well filmed, not so well
"acted"--,
out of electronic range, behind Walls, hidden away in the thousands of
torture chambers and prisons, the new globalization slave trades--
all these persons,--exiled to the "Heart of Darkness"--
where it is supposed that history, writing, poetry,"civilization" do not
exist--
while in the heavily gated "Free Zones" "poetry" and "civilization" are also
carefully controlled and manicured--so that the hands of the poets will be
kept clean--
in handling the delicate surgeries of form--
far from those filthy freezing asylums where Artaud is still howling in the
Plague infested winds

"And if there is still is one hellish, truly accursed thing in our time, it
is our artistic dallying with forms, instead of being like victims burnt at
the stake, signalling through the flames."

Or has it been realized perhaps that the "solution" to this is simply to
"let" others be the victims burning in ever more places--Iraq, Afghanistan,
Palestine and soon enough Iran--so that the dallying with forms may continue
unabated and uninterrupted---

For after all, those signalling through the flames--
are they not enemies, terrorists, making uncivilized gestures one can well
live without?--)

Excellent comments. My point has always been that 1) we need to learn how t=
o write poetry "right" in the same way that painters first have to learn ho=
w to draw and musicians have to first learn how to play a musical instrumen=
t by playing things we recognize before we move on to experiment and push t=
he boundaries (you have to learn the rules before you can break the rules),=
 and 2) too many are trying to over-intellectualize the writing of poetry t=
o such an extend that it alienates readers. Part of 2) is rooted in the pro=
blem of 1), where too many poets think that understanding the history of po=
etry only means paying attention to what happened in their own lifetimes. T=
his myopic view too often creates elitist verse that all sounds the same. O=
ftentimes it creates what is essentially prose with line breaks. What is th=
e difference between poetry and prose? One is rhythmic, the other unrhythmi=
c. To say poetry is rhythmic is not to say that it must be iambic or
 some other "standard" rhythm. Good free verse is also rhythmic, though tha=
t rhythm may not be as regular as a poem written in iambic may be. Poetry i=
s the dance of language; prose is language at a walk (though of course, som=
e people are awkward dancers, and some people have walks that seem to appro=
ach dance). =0A=0AI know that too many people are afraid that rules will ge=
t in the way of creativity -- but this is because of a misunderstanding of =
how rules work. Good rules give you more, not less, freedom. (I refer you t=
o my article, "Literature as a Game": http://blackboard.lincoln.ac.uk/bbcsw=
ebdav/users/dmeyerdinkgrafe/archive/camplin.html) Also, once you learn the =
rules, you internalize them, meaning you are able to use them without them =
"getting in the way." I've noticed too that using rhythm and rhyme have for=
ced me to come up with much more interesting words, metaphors, turns of phr=
ases, and even directions in my poetry. At the same time, the finished poem=
 may not have any sort of rhyme in it -- or the same rhythm. Forcing the po=
em into several boxes can force you to express yourself better, and even cl=
arify to yourself what you're really thinking. More, form tends to work lik=
e a car engine, controlling the explosion of words, emotions, thoughts, etc=
.. and
 turning it into productive work. =0A=0AFor those who are interested, I pro=
vide a poetic explanation of what I have been trying to say here at: http:/=
/themetaphorgroup.blogspot.com/2008/02/introduction_11.html=0A=0AAlso, I de=
monstrate the importance of form to content by writing the same topic in tw=
o different poetic forms here: http://evolutionaryaesthetics.blogspot.com/2=

I'm a little confused about the reading of Shakespeare that could
support a bash of postmodernist use of source, translation, intent,
and interaction.  Version?  Authorial identity?

I'm also a little confused about the bash on English teachers.  Mine
taught me how to read.  It has proven pretty helpful to me, reading.

I don't understand how logic and lyric are opposites.

check this out. the mag itself is very interesting and substantial at 94 =
pages. additionally, those who publish in print and look for some sort =
of workable online version of magazine format will find this quite an =
eye-opener, i would think. rachel has used a web service called =
issuu.com which obviously excels in porting magazine format to the net. =
issuu.com offers one of the most powerful print-online syntheses i've =
seen.

PALM PRESS is pleased to announce the publication of:

LANDSCAPES OF DISSENT: Guerrilla Poetry and Public Space by
Jules Boykoff and Kaia Sand
***

Imagine - and witness - public space that is produced by us. In =
Landscapes of Dissent, Sand and Boykoff remind us that there is a long =
history and ripe presence of intersections between poetry and politics. =
Don Mitchell is quoted in these pages as saying that public space is =
"decisive." In an age in which alienation is among our most prevalent =
health hazards, Landscapes of Dissent demonstrates that poetry may be =
newly, again, good for you. This book is a gift. Take the power. -Carol =
Mirakove

Landscapes of Dissent is a prolegomenon toward a new topoiesis--the =
creation of a new topos, a new place. This book brings forth not only =
the discussion of several practices of disensual use of consensual =
("public") space, but also gives away ideas & insights about what takes =
place thanks to a poetry that makes space in a polis made diapolis. =
Reading this book I found myself feeling an unknown political emotion =
that prompts my passive reader to become a reader ready to engage =
(again) the streets--energized by this discussion in which writing is =
hope & hope is action. Make it public! --Heriberto Yepez

This timely book pushes poetry more firmly into public space at a =
vibrant historical moment when both the public potential of poetry & the =
possibilities of public space are being refigured. In Landscapes of =
Dissent, Boykoff and Sand engage a crucial shift in the relationship of =
poetry & public space: they do not merely insert poetry into an existing =
public sphere imagined as a platform, but rather that show us how both =
poetry & public space take on alternative forms of publicness. These =
acts of publicness join other creative reclamations to assert politics =
in a space the neoliberalism frames as seamless & accessible--& =
therefore post-political. Landscapes of Dissent is expansive & sharp--an =
important book of political-aesthetic scholarship.--Jeff Derksen

THANK GOD William Logan HATES O'Hara!

When I was in fourth grade I saw my enemy eating my favorite, my BELOVED Red
Hots candy!  AND NEVER AGAIN WOULD I EAT THEM!  Well, not for a few years
until I forgot about my enemy.

But I'm happy to have not changed.  Although I wouldn't HATE O'Hara if Logan
LOVED him, but it would turn my stomach a bit.

THIS EVIL REVIEW OF O'HARA SHOULD BE CELEBRATED!

SPREAD THE WORD:  EVIL WILLIAM LOGAN HATES O'HARA, BUY YOUR O'HARA TODAY!

But I'm not a big fan of that new selected I must admit.  Some of my
FAVORITE O'Hara poems not there.  And the cover photo choice irritated me as
well, going for the young, suave O'Hara.  I prefer the Alice Neel portrait
of him with green WEIRD teeth!  He's fucking CREEPY AND BEAUTIFUL all at
once!  I'm SO SICK of poets acting like FASHION MODELS, like those stupid
Sharon Olds photos where she could be selling shampoo or yogurt.  (I'm NO
fan of her poems, but would buy her shampoo)

OH, and I'm also GLAD, VERY GLAD William Logan is homophobic, I MUCH PREFER
the heterosexuals have to deal with him frankly!  If he was a fag I would
CONVERT!

OH FRANK O'HARA GET UP, GET UP, WE LOVE YOU!  GODDAMM-IT POETRY IS FUN!

Troy,

Your post:

"we need to learn how to write poetry "right" in the same way that
painters first have to learn how to draw and musicians have to first
learn how to play a musical instrument by playing things we recognize
before we move on to experiment and push the boundaries (you have to
learn the rules before you can break the rules),"

reminds me of William Logan's review:

"'The poets of the New York School, as they were eventually known,
were long on spontaneity and short on traditional literary effect."

Did you guys meet before these writings? Who are some examples of
poets who are writing "wrongly"?

-Ryan

Beatman explains that in 2001 she was hired to teach basic skills to work=
ers at=20
a paper and printing company. For those of us who teach at-risk students,=
 we=20
know their hardships and sympathize, but Beatman goes one step further th=
an=20
just sympathizing. Chronicling her students' stories, Beatman, in quick p=
oetic=20
glimpses, records their past lives in other countries, their current stru=
ggles,=20
and even their possible futures.=20
=20=20
As anyone can imagine, the stories found in this slim book are varied. In=
=20
Rainbow we see the past of Juan, a fisherman who "cast his net/ on a rain=
bow=20
lake, testing the patched weave" and we see the present: his life in a fa=
ctory=20
with "calloused hands, tattooed with paper cuts." We see Nina in First Sh=
ift=20
who "puts her face/ back on at 5:00 am" her makeup routine complete=20
with "mascara on thick" and "watermelon/ tint to her lips." And we see th=
e=20
maneuvering of family routines in Swing Shift, where "Alicia leaves the h=
ouse=20
at 2:00/ Guillermo gets home at 4:00/ Gracias a Dios / his mama can watch=
/=20
Manuelito in between." These, of course, are only a few stories found in =
this=20
collection; as with real life populations of blue collar workers in the U=
nited=20
States, their stories and memories are as diverse as the population itsel=
f.=20
=20=20
As with any good book (poetry or otherwise), I turned the last page still=
=20
hoping for more. In such collections as this one, there are always openin=
gs,=20
always voices still to be heard, always stories still to be told, but it'=
s been a=20
long time since I have felt such a gap. Beatman's book leaves many questi=
ons=20
unanswered, which is perhaps why I felt such a loss. For example, in Park=
ing,=20
we experience a suggested worker layoff with opening lines "The lucky one=
s=20
punched in on Monday/ one by one, all on time." This poem also depicts th=
e=20
cafeteria and parking lot on that same day:

Maria sat in the cafeteria=20
next to an empty chair.=20
She finally got a shady spot=20
where her '96 Chevy wouldn't cook.=20

Then, there are the closed factories depicted in GoodBones: "The condos o=
n=20
the river side/ will go for what, half mil?/ Wonder what they used to mak=
e here-
/ car parts, blue jeans, envelopes." Certainly, the parking lot spaces, t=
he=20
empty spots in the cafeteria, the decay of urban factories are all strong=
=20
images that leave us wondering about portraits not recorded, the life sto=
ries=20
not being told.=20
=20=20
But finally, there is the question directed towards the poet herself, in =
the=20
haunting Copyright, a poem that depicts the burden of telling another's s=
tory:=20

Leyla Chang invades my dreams=20
strips the white sheet=20

my twitching fingers=20
What's this she says=20
about you writing my life?=20
since when did I=20
become a page number=20
in your table of contents?

And this is why, ultimately, Beatman's work is such a success. Certainly,=
 she=20
has not presented a collection that is "groundbreaking"--other poets have=
=20
written about the physical and emotional struggles of the blue collar wor=
ld. But=20
Beatman's book is very much a reflection of the factory world today. As s=
he=20
herself notes, "Sadly, manufacturing is dying in America. Owners, seeking=
 lower=20
labor costs and fewer regulations, are relocating plants, ironically, to =
many of=20
the developing countries their workers came from." With both the recorded=
=20
stories and the unanswered questions, Beatman echoes the uncertainly of h=
er=20
students' futures, and perhaps, all of our futures as well.=20

I read this review and didn't get this from it at all. The reviewer said there was a lot of good stuff in the collection. He also said (like you did) that there were things left out of the collection he thought should have been left in. What is it you want? A review that is so mindless in its approval and praise of everything O'Hara did that it turns into a kitschy form of worship? Why can't a person say " well, this is better than that . . . ?" Logan doesn't hate O'Hara -- but he doesn't think everything O'Hara touched was golden, either. How can you be a good poet or even understand good poetry if you can't even pick up on the subtilties of a review?

THANK GOD William Logan HATES O'Hara!

When I was in fourth grade I saw my enemy eating my favorite, my BELOVED Red
Hots candy!  AND NEVER AGAIN WOULD I EAT THEM!  Well, not for a few years
until I forgot about my enemy.

But I'm happy to have not changed.  Although I wouldn't HATE O'Hara if Logan
LOVED him, but it would turn my stomach a bit.

THIS EVIL REVIEW OF O'HARA SHOULD BE CELEBRATED!

SPREAD THE WORD:  EVIL WILLIAM LOGAN HATES O'HARA, BUY YOUR O'HARA TODAY!

But I'm not a big fan of that new selected I must admit.  Some of my
FAVORITE O'Hara poems not there.  And the cover photo choice irritated me as
well, going for the young, suave O'Hara.  I prefer the Alice Neel portrait
of him with green WEIRD teeth!  He's fucking CREEPY AND BEAUTIFUL all at
once!  I'm SO SICK of poets acting like FASHION MODELS, like those stupid
Sharon Olds photos where she could be selling shampoo or yogurt.  (I'm NO
fan of her poems, but would buy her shampoo)

OH, and I'm also GLAD, VERY GLAD William Logan is homophobic, I MUCH PREFER
the heterosexuals have to deal with him frankly!  If he was a fag I would
CONVERT!

OH FRANK O'HARA GET UP, GET UP, WE LOVE YOU!  GODDAMM-IT POETRY IS FUN!

I would have to know the literary histories of individual writers to know t=
hat for certain. But I did encounter it en masse among students and even te=
achers of poetry. We see it too in Robert Bly's attitude toward translation=
, where he shows a complete lack of understanding of the importance of the =
needs to translate rhythms and patterns into English and instead in his tra=
nslations created little more than trots. As a consequences, his translatio=
ns are awful. Worse, he influenced an entire generation of translators. He =
could do so because of the general lack of understanding of basic poetics. =
Fortunately, some of the most recent translations I have seen do not reflec=
t his theory of translation. =0A=0AIn fact, it seems that I"m not the only =
one to not the problems of the anti-poetics attitude among too many poets: =

I'm a bookseller myself, and I do know the numbers.  I sell more poetry
books than history books, though I have an excellent selection of both =
and
devote roughly equal shelf space to each.  And I know that most poetry
circulation occurs outside of bookstores, and is not adequately =
represented
by the commercial book trade (nor, for that matter, by the Buffalo =
Poetics
List). My impression is that there are more than a thousand poetry
microcommunities in NYC alone -- people who write poetry, read each =
other's
work and take it seriously -- and all of them read, at least =
occasionally,
work from outside their little group.  Obviously the readership for any =
one
particular book isn't very large, but taken as a whole the poetry =
network
reaches a lot of people -- maybe a fraction of one percent of the total
population of the world: but that's a lot of people!  It's certainly not
nobody, and it's probably more people than read poetry in Ralph Waldo
Emerson's time.

Fun fact: There are approximately 5,000 poetry books published every =
year in
the US alone.  If each book has 10 unique readers (say, the friends and
family of the poet who do not otherwise read poetry), then we're talking
about 50,000 people as a theoretical minimum...

For what it's worth, currently on my blog:http://stephenvincent.net/blog/

 AGGRESSION: A CONFERENCE ON CONTEMPORARY POETICS AND POLITICAL ANTAGONISM: sponsored by Small Press Traffic (May 30 - 31)  - A Haptic Response:                             This is a much belated Haptic response to the Saturday afternoon (May 30 - 31) part of a Conference that I never quite got ‘my arms around’ - tho it gathered together many interesting poets - both as speakers and audience. At its core, its subject was the violence or sense of violation - that poets and (poetry) communities can visit upon each other (in person, publications and/or blogs )- is a good one to address. I suspect the meta-question is whether or not it’s possible any poet(s), and/or new aesthetic proposition (such as say Language Poetry ‘back then’) can assert and position itself without doing personal and/or collective damage? (As well as bring damage on to itself?)  Does a new group formation require knocking out perceived opponents, etc. A kind of exclusive ‘our way or no way’ approach to
 all those ‘others.’ ?? Or are there group processes that might ‘civilize’ the process? (Clearly, on many issues, this country has taken, to put it mildly, a repressive approach).

I think the big problem with Logan's review is that he expected EVERY POEM
to be as brilliant as, say, "Why I am Not A Painter".  And that's simply
foolish.  Perhaps, had O'Hara lived, he would never have issued a collected
poems.  I don't think any poet I know would want every single completed poem
published, for the reason that we all would like to present our best work.
That's why CDs are only 12-17 songs--they're the strongest of the bunch.

The other problem with Logan is that the poets he holds as the zenith of
poetic talent and virtue seem less exciting, talented, etc. to the majority
of people who "care" about poetry, so it becomes difficult for some to take
him seriously.

At any rate, when was the last time a poet was the cover story of the NYT
Books section?

For poetry, any press is good press.

While I think the review is rot, I tend to agree with Angela's last
statement: When was the last time poetry (or a book of poetry) got
anywhere near a cover story? In other words, when was the last time my
relatives asked me if I knew so-and-so's (poet's) work?

The answer? Never.

Troy,

Well, I can safely say that regarding my translations, I'm not
influenced by Robert Bly. And since I find many translations to err on
the level of just WHAT to select (I'm amazed that the stuff I've read
in Spanish, with about 10 exceptions, has been fingered as "needed
translation"), I don't think translation influences me as much as
reading other writers in English. My translation then becomes a dialog
that a foreign text is having with my contemporaries, and
interestingly, this seems to justify translation of the work in the
first place.

But, to respond to your second statement, I don't think you're alone
in your belief; though I do think things are changing. Punk
application to poetry aside, some of the best writers now are some of
the most learned and well read. These, I can cite.

Dear Poets and Poet-Tasters,

We, The Stain of Poetry gatherers, have now finished organizing our smorgasboard of wholesome poets for the rest of the year here:  http://thestainofpoetry.wordpress.com/.  Please prepare to dine upon the lot, starting:

  July 25th @ 7 p.m. - Stain Bar - Williamsburg, Brooklyn

  ** Baker, Cordelli, Field, Need, Newton, and Tonelli**

  ~~~

  Andrea Baker is the author of like wind loves a window (Slope Editions, 2005) and the chapbooks gilda (Poetry Society of America, 2004) and true poems about the river go like this (Cannibal Books, 2008).

  ~~~~

  Phil Cordelli cleans lawns, carries on a love affair with the tuliptrees of Upper Manhattan that may not be carrying on for much longer now, and acts as a conduit for poetic impulses from the plant
  world. More on this as it develops.

  ~~~~

  Farrah Field’s first book, Rising, is forthcoming in early 2009 by Four Way Books. Her poems have appeared in many publications such as the Mississippi Review, Margie, Chelsea, The Massachusetts Review, Typo, Harp & Altar, and are forthcoming in Pebble Lake Review, Another Chicago Magazine, Fulcrum, and 42Opus. She lives in Brooklyn.

   ~~~~

  Originally from Massachusetts, David Need lives in Durham,  NC and works as an instructor in the Religion Department at Duke, teaching classes on Buddhism, South Asian Religions, and Religion and Poetry. Recent and upcoming publications include several suites published in Fascicle 2 & 3, a translation/essay series on Rg Veda poetry in Talisman, an excerpt from “Places I’ve Lived” upcoming in Minor American, and excerpts from “St. John’s Rose Slumber” upcoming in Effing and Hambone. Several years ago Mipoesis ran a series of essays by David on Rilke and three short memoir pieces, and Ocho ran yet another sonnet suite. Current projects include a long poem written alongside the Gospel of Mark, “Places I’ve Lived”, which is evolving into an open ended project, finalizing a collection of translations of Rilke’s French poetry, and yet another Rg Veda essay, this one on the theme of twins there and in the poetry of Nate Mackey. David is associated with the NC lucipo poets, and
 lives with his scholar wife and four cats.

  ~~~~

  Keith Newton edits the online magazine Harp & Altar. His poems and translations have appeared in Harvard Review, Cannibal, Typo, and Circumference, among other journals, and a chapbook of his work is forthcoming in 2008 from Cannibal Books. He lives in Brooklyn.

  ~~~

  Chris Tonelli lives in the Boston area where he runs The So and So Series. He has work forthcoming in Saltgrass, Salt Hill, Absent, and Good Foot, and is the author of three chapbooks: For People Who Like Gravity and Other People (Rope-A-Dope Press, forthcoming), A Mule-Shaped Cloud (w/ Sarah Bartlett, horse less press, 2008), and WIDE TREE: Short Poems (Kitchen Press, 2006).

yes ny po-communities are
totally scattered and biased communtities

but hey sometimes tho only the poet keeps score or as saint-poets try not
to act like they care
we do sell books  tho most seem to only do it at their readings
and hope that the stores  and  SPD will do the rest and that maybe we'll
occasionally get a review
tho they don't help much  /  notr in many cases do awrds  as i so
recently found out
but
i've sold on my own hundreds of my books to folks
whether that even counts can't really be determined because only i and
they know this fact
tho the stores have sold some as well  - i sold almost 400 copies of my
last book on my own
bravo  but who cares  and who's counting other than me -
like bowling a perfect game with no one there to witness it
so sure folks read em
but most folks who bought em are interested in my work
because they know me as part of the music community i've been involved in

and the rest are usually poets
but the music folk are important because some have limited po-experience
and hopefully i help em open up a bit

i expect that's false. if you look at the work of significant abstract
painters, you see it has almost nothing to do with 'drawing' and one would
expect these artists not to be particularly competent at 'drawing', ie,
drawing representations of things in the world.

being able to draw representations of things in the world is simply not a
necessity anymore to being able to create interesting, significant art.
which isn't to say that one can't produce interesting, significant art with
drawing. just that there are large realms of image production where it
simply isn't in the picture.

similarly, in writing, well, writing is a much larger thing now than it once
was.

I would say, however, that every significant abstract painter was good at

It's not false. The abstract expressionists could all draw (though some of their pretenders, who were all failures, could not), and none of them were just throwing paint around, as is commonly misunderstood. Why would you take anyone seriously who claimed to be an artist when all they could do was sling paint. That might just indicate that that is all they are capable of -- which is anything but creative. My brother is a painter, and has a BA, an MA and is currently working on his MFA -- at 3 different universities, and at each one, drawing was emphasized. Every visual artist I know has talked about how drawing was emphasized as a foundation. Every visual artist I know has said that nobody is going to take you seriously if you can't draw. The bottom line is, if you don't have the basics down, and if you don't have a wide variety of techniques available to you, you are extremely limited in what you can do as any kind of artist. If you are a painter who is
 incapable of drawing, you are limited to the extreme -- and most people are going to judge that you are doing the work you are doing only because you can't do anything else. You are right that there is a lot of art work which can be made without drawing, but the underlying skill is still necessary, as a part of understanding how images are made, and their underlying structure.

"and remember to die" is from Jonathan Williams's MARVELOUS poem "POEM
BEGINNING WITH FIVE WORDS BY GERARD MANLEY HOPKINS" for Jesse Helms.

OOOOO!  I WISH JONATHAN WAS ALIVE to READ this poem in honor of Jesse's
death yesterday!  And I'm sure Jonathan would have hooted and hollered with
us here in Philly over Jesse dying on the 4th of July!  THAT INDEPENDENCE
DAY DEATH IS POETRY!

For those unfamiliar with Jonathan's poem, CELEBRATE Jesse's DEATH with us
in reading it OUT LOUD wherever you happen to be right now!  Click here:
http://chax.org/eoagh/issue3/issuethree/williams.html

When I asked Jonathan for permission to reprint the poem in this issue
of EOAGH (published by Tim Peterson), that I was co-editing with others
(kari edwards, Paul Foster Johnson, Erica Kaufman, Jack Kimball, and Stacy
Szymaszek), Jonathan said on the phone, "ONLY IF IT'S THE LEAD POEM!"  And I
said, "YOU BETCHA JONATHAN!"  HEHEHE!  That was a fun and sometimes
disturbing phone conversation, Jonathan talking about Jesse's reign of
terror against Southern queers, African Americans, and ANY OTHER minorities,
as you can imagine.  He would tell horror stories of Jesse's EXTREME
bigotry, then pepper the conversation with talking about greasing his
asshole for the corn poke, and such.  "JUST KEEPING IT REAL, AS THEY SAY,"
he said!

DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD!  I'm NOW LISTENING to the Klaus Nomi version of
DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD, a fitting tribute!

Glad Jesse FINALLY remembered to die!

you pose an interesting point that i've always supported  but sadly say
in my case i ask
what does it mean "to be able to write"
what we learn beiyond the act of recognizing writing and spelling?
ie sonnet structure sesina (which once abandoned me in 2 lines)
i'm one of those hypocrites (sp)
who can't write but does because it's easier than playing music or
drawing
because i learned it first then forgot what i learned
cecil taylor picasso learned and went their own way pollock
then some just went their own way because they couldn't learn so they
improvised
but i still think tho not a necessity i wish we all who created could
DRAW what we see
then take off from there

i've looked at quite a bit of the work of kandinsky, and i don't recall
anything that indicates he had much ability to draw. even his landscapes are
not very  'well drawn'. their interest has nothing to do with drawing
ability.

it's bad criticism to judge writing, say, by what it isn't. you look at what
it is. that is more important. why would you require an artist be able to do
something that they don't practice in their own work before respecting them
as an artist? look at their work. that should tell you all you need to know.

but of course that is precisely what most people cannot do: look at the work
itself and know whether it is any good. instead, they ask if you can draw a
cat. sad, very sad.

the serious visual artists i've talked with seem to feel it isn't necessary
to be able to draw to do interesting work. and that is obvious to me.
drawing does not underlie all painting. particularly today, as the computer
enters into painting, in the work of some artists, as strongly as the brush
and the paint and the canvas. into an art as much focussed on algorithms as
anything else.

your essentialism, troy, is misguided. the arts have exploded into a
multiplicity that defies essentialism.

Dear All

Kaurab Online's Translation Archive has just published its second update.
http://www.kaurab.com/english

This update covers, among Bengali poets, Buddhadeb Bose, Malay Roy Choudhury
and Barin Ghosal.

The Buddhadev Bose page is authored by Pat Clifford.
Constant advice and encouragement from Jyotirmoy Dutta and Damayanti Basu
Singh has helped enrich this entry.

Malay Roy Choudhury's page includes his much mythified poem Stark Electric
Jesus, which in the past 40 years has been the most anthologized
contemporary Bengali poem in English and is included in Poems for the
Millenium, Vol. 1 ed. by Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris (1995), Stark
Electric was first published by Lawrence Ferlinghetti in City Lights, later
by Howard McCord (several editions). Stark Electric Jesus is a
transcomposition made from the original Bengali poem titled "prachanda
boidyutik chhutaar".

Malay's page also links a rare vignette on the Hungryalist Movement only to
be found in Kaurab. This can be
directly viewed here -
http://www.kaurab.com/english/bengali_poetry/Hungry-Generation/
All poems of Malay Roy Choudhury are translated by the poet.

Likewise, Barin Ghosal translated his poems.

The interview section includes the following -
a. Joseph Parisi, ex-editor of POETRY, interviewed by Ankur Saha
b. Turkish poet Lale Muldur interviewed by me.

We also re-launched the Book Opener section which is an international poetry
book review series, edited by Dana Ward and me.
This update includes reviews by David Baptiste Chirot (Poems from
Guantánamo) and William Allegrezza (The Grimoire of Grimalkin).

Happy Reading !

I'm really troubled by this drawing = basics argument.  Is this
actually an argument about representation; representational drawing?
Objects?  Portraiture?  Design?  Use of Space / the page?   Is it one
about drawing with paint, pencil, ink, crayon, on canvas, on linen, on
cotton paper, on... wet plaster?  Is it about shading, cross hatching,
different weights and hardnesses/softnesses of lead?

All best,

"Learn the rules, then break them" ???

Charkes Olson (who happily has come up a lot in all this Summer of Troy comment & commotion) believed in this in regard to *grammar*.

I remember from memoirs & histories of Olson & Black Mountain that O. was frustrated by the grammatical ineptitude of some of the students he was trying to teach.

"How can I teach them to write American, when they can't even write English?" he was known to lament.

Most MFAs in Creative Writing Stress Language

I have to say I learned a lot about language
getting an MFA in Written
Language; I had to know
what I was talking about
what they were putting down
I was picking up. Formulas
geese migration
ways of the written language stress
Creative Writing is good at bringing
el Payno no Gayno good at bringing
flexible muscle tissue to writing
your nose creative nothing to laugh about
Creative writing MFAs are confident in language
where most undergrads shake and question
MFAs are SURE! Self-Unimportant Righter Elves

the holiday season...Graduamication!

Bruce Connor, esteemed & brilliant assemblage innovator in sculpture, painting and film, passed away in San Francisco yesterday. Dark portrayer of the 'under-soul' and luminous, angelic portrayer of the 'over-soul' his alchemic seeming transformations of detritus were mesmeric -  in Edgar Alan Poe needed a lazer beam transmssion into the substance of the contemporary, or if 30's surrealism needed un autre enfant terrible,  Connor was an extraordinary agent.   Not an 'easy dude' by all accounts -  particularly by many foiled curators - he leaves an assured legacy. When the measuring of mid-Century American art is done, I suspect Connor will be viewed as Raushenberg's dark brother.  Suggest Minimally honor the day, if you can find his short movies composed of found footage, "A Movie", for one.   Not to over-do the dark imprint, Connor ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors circa 1966 in a long comic City tradition of unelectable musicans and artists, including Joel
 Biafra, lead singer of the Dead Kennedys.

 I am sure there will be many 'real' Connor orbits, Look to them for more facts.

 The other day I found myself dropping into see David Highsmith, poet and entrepreneur of bookshelves in a store that includes lots of fresh raw wood constructions. David smartly tapped into the San Francisco/Castro neighborhood serial appartment dweller need for new shelves,
 Sweetly, however, he's created a wonderful bookstore for poetry books - not just poetry books, but volumes of 'old' and new 'avant' presses (whatever that means for whatever era.) He also shops ebay and finds out of print volumes that he resells without upping the price. I stumbled into an English pirate edition of Spicer's After Lorca - a genuine piece of simulacra of Duncan's original typesetting for $20 - if you are interested.  Just a lot of stuff - beautifully displayed &  presented on fresh bookshelves. (No longer do interesting books remain a critique on Ron Silliman's blook - 'the book made flesh'.  The whole place has an attractive, no-pressure retail feel. You can enjoy a book while the occaisonal clientele is talking to David about wood, sizes, and so forth.

 In addition, he has a regular reading series, and omens of a new chapbook series.  Not to take anything away from City Lights and Green Apple and Bird & Beckett's substantial poetry book sections, as Independent stores become more and more fragile, Books & Bookshelves is a treat.

 I suspect David is on the top wave edge of the future. An Independent bookstore that wants to survive will offer a substantial line of bookshelves!  Or, as a friend who has a relatively successful and good gallery told me, "It's the framers who make the real money in this business, not the gallery."

 So if you live or are in the City for a visit...

These Supplements are a small way of saying Thanks to the staff and spirit
of Kaurab for their inspirational work in bringing Bengali Poetry to the
World and in presenting new examples of writings, interviews, reviews from
poets ever more countries.

Poet and editor Aryanil Mukherjee yesterday announced the appearance of the
latest large collection of  work to appear:

Kaurab Online's Translation Archive has just published its second update.
http://www.kaurab.com/english



The Supplement with the Ginsberg Introduction to "A Few Bengali Poets" (City
Lights Journal 2, 1963) is one of the reasons, as is pointed out in the new
Kaurab Translation Update, that though the Hungry Poets had been in
existence already for some years, the arrival of Ginsberg and his
involvement with them has led to a mistaken "myth" that these poets were
influenced by the Beats.

(an example of the persistence of this myth may be found in the 1994 Note by
Bruno Sourdin to the French translations of poems by Pradip Choudhuri, which
appears in Supplement 2.)

This latest Update from Kaurab presents an astonishing History of the Hungry
Poets, with galleries of photos and intensive and extensive information,
insights and commentaries regarding the Hungry Movement and its influences
in Bengali poetry and steadily through time in many parts of the world.

(Bruno Sourdin notes the international character of the appearances of the
works of Pradip Choudhuri, for example.)

Kaurab Translation Update "Hungryalist" issue is an immensely exciting event
for Poetry--

I can't recommend it highly enough--

 I am very sad to pass on the news that Chicano poet and essayist, Alfred Arteaga, has passed away.  Alfred was an extraordinary multi-lingual poet, often writing poems through in English, Spanish, French, German and Nahua.  He was the author of several books of poetry (Cantos, Red, Love in the Time of Aftershocks) and of cultural studies (Chicano Poetics and An Other Tongue). His latest book of poetry, Frozen Accident, came out in fall 2006 from Tia Chucha's Press. He was Professor of Chicano Studies at UC Berkeley, an institution he somehow managed to survive as a poet and a human being. He remains online at alfredarteaga.com.

Catherine,

Thanks for that, specifics, details, are the spice of life, something to get
your teeth into, too much 'byting' and you are left toothlessly skimming
over the surface of life.  Drawing used to be perceived as merely a
preparation for a painting or other 'finished' artwork, but of course it is
now a genre in its own right, even animated video works often rely heavily
on drawn forms and drawing was well represented in all the London degree
shows this summer. Line-drawn portraits such as those by Matisse, Schiele
Calder or Giacometti, stark, spare but sublime contrast sharply with the
emotively charged, richly textured, 'Autobiographical' self-portraits of
such as Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Munch or Beckmann, all equally
compelling, but somehow the drawings have a greater immediacy, a dynamic
spontaneity. The spare, accomplished line drawing deceptively simple might
be compared to the complexity of the haiku without its formulaic strictures.
To draw what we can't see is also quite important - to exercise our
imagination and sponsor our dreams, to express unique and individual
contributions to the world.

Roy Exley.

Hello ~ for those of you in or near Providence, I hope you won't miss this:


---------- Forwarded message ----------
From: Justin Katko <justin.katko@gmail.com>

Subject: "unfolding king lear a model"


Dear friends:

You are invited to a performance of "unfolding king lear a model", a solo
theatre production by Jeremy Hardingham. The event will take place at 7pm on
*this* Friday, July 11th, at 50 Agnes Street in Providence (Olneyville).
There will be wine and some opening music. The main act will run just under
one hour. The event is free.

Directions: (Take Westminster or Broadway west, after Broadway and
Westminster converge take a left on Stokes Street, then left on Dike Street,
then a quick right onto Agnes. 50 Agnes is on the left with a grand
entrance, above the door a sign reads "Indestructible Pearls" -> it was a
19th century pearl manufacturer of some sort).

Jeremy Hardingham is the Judith E. Wilson Drama Studio Manager at the
Faculty of English, Cambridge University (England). He is the author of
_Incarnate's / And yet but still just this_ (Barque Press). Praise of
Hardingham's work follows below. Please forward this on to interested
parties.

Regards,
Justin Katko

Chris Goode (beescope.blogspot.com) has this to say about "unfolding king
lear a model":

'unfolding king lear a model' is a solo in which Hardingham seems to be, at
one and the same time, chewing and regurgitating King Lear, in a sort of
terrible parody of circular breathing techniques. Some of the text is
retained, and external fragments interpolated, as if spoken from a redacted
transcript in which some stray papers have become mixed up and almost
everything explicit has been obliterated by an oversolicitous and weirdly
erratic censor. At one point I have the odd experience of recognizing a
fragment of text from one of the pieces Jeremy and I made together some
years ago as a duo called COAT: and I realise I don't know where that
particular phrase came from in the first place -- I had always assumed he
wrote it, but now I'm not sure. Is it perhaps even in King Lear somewhere?
There is a sense in Jeremy, not only in this piece but between all his works
and across whatever membrane he or I might in a moment of weakness visualize
separating his life and his writing, of a huge, unceasing, autophagous
intertextual churn, in which individual voice and authority are
disassembled: not indiscriminately, in some callow mulching of 'high' and
'low' culture, but so as to mimic the ways in which information within those
cultures is transmitted, sometimes preserved, sometimes lost entirely or at
best lost in translation. In this turbulent field -- one might almost say
minefield -- Jeremy skips and tumbles and flees his own shadow, negotiating
its pitfalls and overleaping its ha-has and feigning the occasional stumble:
it's the Z-Boys mix of precision and (real, not simulated) spontaneity, but
also a kind of convulsive ingenuity that seems far from recreational and
resembles more nearly a hypertextual restyling of the flight-or-fight
impulse, a nervously contemporary survival tactic.

As ever with Jeremy's work there is an odd sense of danger -- the
intermixing on his crowded props table of sheet glass and hammers, of water
and electricity -- which persists despite my certain knowledge that, at his
best, his work always feels like that, and in over a decade I've never known
him actually put himself or his audience in anything like the danger that he
evokes. The visual styling of his presence is a rough-and-ready mix of
world-war aviator and cyberpunk: in this, as in his language, there are
obvious traces of Beckett and Beuys and Artaud, and possibly Kantor (I
wonder). Visually and aurally there is an awesomely deft choreography of
layers, particularly striking in this instance in his use of music and
sound, which is more sophisticated here than I've identified in his work
before. Again it is the complexity, not as styling but as argument, that
ultimately is moving and impressive and jags in the mind: for all the
ferociousness of his inquiry into language and object and abstraction and
absence, as ever his work is alive with the essentially theatrical discovery
of how the individual, buffeted (as Lear is) by what seem to be malign
extraneities, contains and embodies all the graces and desolations of
properly collective response, and spells out in poetry and grunting the
massed chorus of aloneness. It's the best work I've seen Jeremy do in many
years; at the time, there's no way of saying so. Finally this blog has a
purpose.

There is a big catalogue from a retrospective - started at the Whitney - just a few years back. Conner (right spelling!) was very involved with poets of his time - he came to San Francisco from Kansas along with Michael McClure. His film and art work of the late fifties and early sixties are implictly animated by the nuclear terror/jitters of the time.
 In addition to A Movie - which is composed totally of 'found' speeded up film footage  of crashes (trains, planes, etc.) (the real psychic underbelly of Dr. Strangelove, aka General Curtis LeMay) Another Conner classic accounts the moving of Jay DeFeo's massive Rose from her studio to the San Francisco Art Institute.
 Minimally,  I believe, the work is distributed by Canyon Cinema.

 Yes, Miekal, I think it's time to put the 'r' back into o(r)bits - it suggests recycling, spiraling and all that, I mean, let the dead take wing! Enough of this 'deep six' stuff after a paragraph in the local news.

 By the way I hear there is a Conner orbit in today's NY Times.

 * Art:  Rockwell Re-enlisted for a Nation's Darker Mood
<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/arts/design/09rock.html?ex=1216267200&en=47ca8621fc3d96d0&ei=5070&emc=eta1>
*
 By DAMIEN CAVE
 A new exhibition in Florida features 60 artists' responses to Norman
Rockwell's wartime "Four Freedoms" series.


Senate bows to Bush, approves surveillance bill - Yahoo! News

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080709/ap_on_bi_ge/terrorist_surveillance
*


The interest of the Times review is that journalist Damien Cave had spent 18
months ("off and on") in Iraq; this "frames" his view of the exhibit and the
passersby almost completely ignoring it as a "reflection" of the "Darker
Mood" that the contemporary artists bring to Rockwell's vision, which itself
darkened during the Vietnam War.

The "Four Freedoms" that Rockwell depicted and are re-invisioned in the
Exhiibtion, today took another heavy blow to the "heart and mind"as the
Glorious, Courageous Senate once agin rubberstamped the Bush
administration's Assaul on the Constitution.

In years gone by, only Probation or Parole could mean a change in one's
Fourth Amendment Rights, and that was strictly controlled by the Law.

Now the Fourth Amendment is becoming a fading anachronism as far as the
Lawmakers of Today are concerned.

In order to defend the Nation--the citizen must be ever more deprioved of
their Freedoms, which are being ever more "defended" by the by the ever more
strengthened "Homeland Security" in the "War on Terror."

The more Freedoms you lose at home, the more you know they are being
defended abroad.  And here at home, too--with al that surveillance going on
of one's fellow citizens--

President FD Roosevelt famously said--"We have nothing to Fear but Fear
itself."

A "War on Terror" means that one needs to be always & ever more Terrified--

And in the name of Terror--the State requires citizens to give up as many
Rights is possible so that they can rest safel;y in knowing that they
thmselves are wel protected from Terror.

History has proved Dr Goebbels right when he stated that the only thing
needed to do to ever more tightly control a soceity is to say--that it is
Threatened From Outside--

so that the Threats from Inside grow worse all the time, yet pass by
unnoticed, much as passersby pass the art exhibtion by almost unnoticed.

Who, after all, wants to look at things which offer any critique too
closely?

Senator Obama like the two thirds majority voted for this increase in
Surveillance and immunity for the telecoms.  Who can afford to look "weak on
Terror" when running for Office?

In Wisconsin one may feel glad that once again "our" Senator Feingold--the
only Senator who voted NO to the Patriot Act--louldy opposed this.

In the last two weeks the Senate approved 170 million dollars more military
aide for Israel (which already receives 3 billion annuully already)--yet did
not pass a single bill for any program for American citizens.

The reason of course is in the name of the "War on Terror."

The greater the Terror after all--the more things have to be taken care of
somewhere else--
sacrificing Rights and Freedoms here--why be concerned about Rights and
Freedoms of others ?
Who cares if the State and its allies are War Criminals?

Robespierre  said that the two arms of the State are "Terror and Purity."

"Terrorism" itself came later in history--in the second half of the 19th
Century.

The State discovered that by crying "terrorism!!!"--it could unlesh Terror
and Purity with impunity--in fact, by "voting" as it has  today, to give
itself and its cronies Immunity as it were.  No matter how great the horrors
and Terror and the ethnic and other cleaning operations undertaken by the
State--that which is done by "terrorists" is always of a far more Evil
nature.

No one remembers when the Americans themselves were the "terrorists" against
the Birtish State and King--

Read the Declaration of Independence and discover that the State of today
must be overthrown by the citizens.   Everything it and its allies stands
for and does daily is what the Declaration was against, and declared its
Independence from.

It is any wonder then that the State of today carries on a continaul assault
agsint the Declaration and the Constitution?  If anyone really took them
seriously --why the State would all be locked up, lock stock and barrel--or
executed as traitors.

You see right away why these documents need to be revised so badly. If one
lived by them, one would be a "terrorist" in the eyes of all that is held
so dearly today as the "people's" deepest desire and greatest necessity"--,
in the name of the War on Terrorism.

During the Reign of Terror in France, which last week over a year--about the
same number of persons were killed as were in 1871 during the Bloody Week in
which the Sate suppressed the Commune.  Then, a much more efficient State,
heavily aremd with the support of world wide media and opinion outraged by
al those "terrorists" in charge of the City of Paris--slaughtered 20--25,000
people in full view of the patrons of cafes, who, now feeling ever more
Secure, could sit at again at their sidewalk "spots" and enjoy a cozy drink,
enjoying whole heartedly their ringside seats at the murder  going on all
about them.

After all, Terror and Purity were making sure that "terrorism" would no
longer live in their midst for at least a long generation, if not for
several.

With every new law enacted, evry new bill passed, inexorbaly, the State is
making sure that there really will be no "terrorists" in the society's
midst.  not only "terrorists" from elsewhere, but in the citizens' midst,
homegrown terrorists of all kinds. To help further the laready ever
lengthening "arm of the Law" of the Sate, there is now a vevival of programs
outof use since WW2, only thenew ones are to be even more stringent.  These
recruit and train ordianry citizens as well as ploice, fire fighters ,
postal wrokers, etc--in the daily War at Home--that is, persons tarined to
be neighbor "outlook posts" as it were--keping their eyes and ears open 24/7
fror the slightest signs of "persons acting suspiciously" or "taking
photgrphas of uninteresting sites."
If developed successfully, why, the State could be the proud creators of a
form of "undercover secret police" not unlike that in China today.

Are you good and tired of your neighbor's penchant for mowing the lawn
during your "qulity time" with your poetry writing--hek, the guy seems very
suspicious deosn't he.  Look at al the mail that he gets that comes in brown
paper wrapping--
or al those late night phone calls when you can hear him speaking in a
foreign language--

Yes, turn in him and by God, no more interruptions in the Poetry!!

Think how much more Creative oneself and one's colleagues could be, once
freed from al these "suspicious foreign influences"--or simply noisy
neighbors--

Haven't you noticed how much more Creative a nation we are becoming daily--?
The incredible increase in the number of poeple writing and reading Poetry
for example--?

"Don't drop the ball--make the Call!!"

Yes, Miekal, I think it's time to put the 'r' back into o(r)bits -
it suggests recycling, spiraling and all that, I mean, let the dead take wi=

Enough of this 'deep six' stuff after a paragraph in the local news.

By the way I hear there is a Conner orbit in today's NY Times.=20

Hello,

As poetry editor of WSQ (Women's Studies Quarterly), a journal published by
the Feminist Press, I'm currently reading submissions for our next issue, which
will have the theme of Technology. Please consider sending unpublished poems
that you feel fit this theme (including poems generated by technology and
hypertexts which could be posted on WSQ's website). Send to me at ossipk@aol.com
by August 1.

WSQ has a wide readership of academics and is adopted for classroom use. I've
been delighted to include poems by Rebecca Wolff, Maxine Chernoff, Christina
Davis, Nicole Cooley, and Annie Finch, among others, in past issues.

Thanks!
Kathy Ossip

Theater Oobleck presents
THE STRANGERER

One of the books on President Bush's 2006 vacation reading list was Albert Camus' absurdist tale of senseless murder, The Stranger.

In hopes that the French philosopher might shed some light on the recent political clime - or vice versa - Mickle Maher's new play The Strangerer collides several of Camus' works with the first Bush/Kerry presidential debate in 2004.

A murder mystery with the murderers in plain view, it asks one of the most important questions of our day:

Why does our president want to kill a lot of innocent people?

Performances July 9 - August 20
Tues thru Sat @ 7:30PM
Sunday @ 2:30PM & 7PM
Running time: 90 minutes

at the Barrow Street Theatre
27 Barrow Street -- New York City
(at 7th Avenue, South of Christopher Street)

Theater Oobleck has no Managing Director, no Artistic Director, no Technical Director, no Musical Director, no production directors.

A limited number of hotel rooms are available at the Homewood Suites
by Hilton Chicago-Downtown, 40 East Grand Avenue, Chicago.  This hotel
is a very short cab or subway ride from the Columbia campus.  The
Homewood Suites prepared a special link for us to book online.  Just
click below and you'll find directions for reserving a room:

It's important that you book your room as soon as possible, as the
Chicago Marathon is taking place October 12.  (We only discovered this
convergence recently, after we'd already booked the featured
readers.)

A Visitor's Guide for the Beat Symposium is pasted below, with a list
of nearby hotels.  Columbia College Chicago is located downtown, in
the heart of the city's South Loop neighborhood, and is easily
accessible from these hotels by foot or cab.  All major subway/El
trains come into the South Loop, too, so it's possible to book hotels
in other parts of the city and make it to the Symposium without
difficulty.

Mention that you're a Columbia College Chicago visitor to receive
discounted rates at some of these hotels.  It's crucial to book as
soon as possible because of the marathon.

For more information, contact Tony Trigilio at ttrigilio@colum.edu
(312-344-8138).


VISITOR'S GUIDE:  THE BEAT GENERATION SYMPOSIUM

Airports:
O'Hare Airport (western suburbs) and Midway Airport (southern suburbs)
are the two airports servicing the Chicgao area.  They are
approximately equidistant from Columbia College.

Transportation:
 >From Midway Airport, take the Orange Line elevated train to Adams
Street. From there, walk south on Wabash until you reach Congress
Parkway. From O'Hare Airport, take the Blue Line to La Salle. Walk
East on Congress (away from the Chicago Stock Exchange Building, which
you'll see upon emerging from the subway) until you reach Wabash
(about 5 short blocks).

Use www.transitchicago.com's<http://www.transitchicago.com's/> free
Trip Planner service to plan the rest of your trips while you're here.
 Simply enter your starting point and destination, and Trip Planner
gives you detailed directions. As of 2008, fares are $2.00 one-way
with a $0.25 transfer. Each train station has kiosks where you can buy
transit cards and reload them (cash only). The Blue Line and Red Line
run 24/7; the other lines stop running for a few hours late at night.

Taxis are available throughout the city. From Midway Airport to the
English Department, cab fare would be approximately $25 and from
O'Hare Airport cab fare would be approximately $50. If you need to
call a cab, call (773) or (312) TAXICAB.

in just a few days the uc santa cruz workforce is going on strike and
i'm trying to think about what to do with my students for the three
days that we will be meeting on the picket lines.

has anyone run into any ideas about how to do good political writing?
and for this small moment, what small practical exercises students of
varying engagements might engage in in order to connect with what they
see and do there?

there have been some good discussions amongst organizers and activists
about what it feels good to shout: short truths. simple ones,
sometimes with rhythm, but not necessarily so. bilingual shouting
feels good somehow.

but what ele?

i want so much for all to go well

here at this small strange universitiy with an illustrious history,
and rapidly overtaking decline.

Used to be, but in fact Bruce's film have been out of
distribution for a year or so.  If i were to make an
educated guess, however, i would say that Canyon would
be the place to look for them in the not too distant
future.

Canyon Cinema: http://www.canyoncinema.com/
[nothing of Conner's there now]

You can click on something unauthorized on YouTube or
UbuWeb i'm sure.  You can also call me a film snob,
but i hope that people get to see the work in a
theater with good sound and picture.  If you see them
all compressed on your computer, it's like listening
to Bach on a transistor radio at the beach.  Easy to
think, "so what?"

Call for Poetry Submissions
"Spiraled Connections: 40 years of Indigenous Journeys at UCLA"

The American Indian Studies Center at UCLA is seeking poetry
submissions for a fortieth-anniversary anthology commemorating its
forty years of publishing books by and about Native peoples. We
envision this anthology as a collection of materials by Indigenous
poets directly connected to UCLA in the past forty years and those
they have mentored or influenced.
Our aim is to illustrate and celebrate the ways that Native people
present at the core of the American Indian educational movement have
radiated their innovation and empowerment out to the community in all
directions. Submissions do not have to be education-oriented.

Deadline: February 1, 2009

WHO CAN SUBMIT: Indigenous poets (having origin in any of the original
peoples of North America and who
maintain cultural identification through tribal affiliation or
community recognition) connected in some way to
UCLA (alumni, former/current professor/undergraduate/graduate/staff,
folks previously published in AICRJ or
other American Indian Studies Center publications) and those they have
mentored or influenced.

WHAT TO SUBMIT: Up to five poems (single spaced), not to exceed a
total of ten typed pages. We are open to
all poetic styles and forms. Poems in your Indigenous language will be
considered but you must also provide
English translation with your submission. What have we become in these
past forty years of American Indian
scholarship, education, community, intellectual, creative and academic
adventure? Who have we become, who
have we touched, how have we grown, transformed, helped each other,
learned to negotiate the academy, our
multiple roles and lives? How can we, as poets, express this Indigenous journey?

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES: Please include name, email, phone, address, and
a brief bio along with your submissions.
While unpublished pieces are preferred, previously published material
will be considered. If something
has been previously published, please let us know where and when it
was published, and whether you have the
rights to your own material.

HOW TO SUBMIT: Inquiries can be directed to Deborah Miranda:
mirandad@wlu.edu. Deadline: February 1,
2009. Please send submissions with an SASE for response to:

Deborah Miranda
English Department
Washington and Lee University
204 W. Washington St.
Lexington, VA 24450

ABOUT THE EDITOR: Deborah Miranda is an Esselen/Chumash poet and
scholar, currently an associate
professor of English at Washington and Lee University in Lexington,
Virginia, where she teaches creative writing,
literature, and composition. She has published two poetry collections,
Indian Cartography and The Zen of La
Llorona; projects forthcoming are The Light from Carrisa Plains: A
Tribal Memoir, and Written on the Bark of
Trees: Praise Poems.

Introducing myself before inviting you to visit www.carolberge.com would be a travesty. After all, Carol Berge (add an accent over the "e" please) was a forerunner in the rush to assemble and expand The Scene during the 1960s in Manhattan, as well as a recognized poet and author. Her awards include NEA and NYSCA fellowships and a Pushcart Prize for a story she published by Ed Sanders in her literary magazine CENTER. She also taught writing at universities nationwide. Over her lifetime she published 22 books of poetry, fiction and nonfiction, edited handsful of publications, and had her stuff published in over 200 little magazines. Info on her final short story collection, ANTICS, as well as the forthcoming Light Years anthology, can be found at her site.

As for me, I'm a journalist and editor, and have 11 yet-to-be unpublished works copywritten with the LOC. My poetry is rough and I prefer doing fiction or essays. All of it's maybe too rough or avant-garde or far-reaching or ego-centric... I keep writing, as a compulsion and a therapy and an art form. Feel free to write, say hi, etc. My interest in your group stems from a mention of Carol Berge, alongside other notable poets, electronically preserved on your listserv from 1999. If only we could keep e-versions of ourselves! But that's further off than cryogenics, if scientists are correct. And if perception is objective, as a concept. Anyway, thanks for the group and long live poetics.

James Beach, editor

From Disaster Suites by Rob Halpern:

This war
Of want
Says what

I want
To say
To you

Of dreams
Or need
We need

Not speak
To speak
Of wars

Of want
I come
To love

So late
To you
My lost

- marine.

from O Coevals by Thom Donovan

We witness bells that this was theirs
That shade equals sun in exquisiteness

Non-identities piling up like pylons
A physics without cars beings without

Impact move to what here to what
Their equated it I feel so much pressure

Around you to burn a discourse and not
Touch any time we were or event

Living us so live my life will never finish
What my death leaves unfinished this

Town never seems to work those sovereign
Stumps sing us into battle effects

Of power fires hymns even the sun
Forgot to burn so sing patiency which

Organs won't be consumed what ex
change won't always be sung for being

Too far from off-shore what bodies we
Haven't won't account for limbs little

Substances Nature complicit with who
Gets to live grieves its contrivance.

***
from Amanda Ackerman:

Here on fire we remove the husk of the seed with the aching to peel back
with the aching to hear; to touch is to look, the seed looks like and =
says
this:
It is spring, but my corn does not want to sell her rooster. If I wait
another year, the rooster will be considered old, quite old, very old.  =
And
having been an upright and tireless citizen his whole life, always =
dressed
in devoted red, always smelling like humid, dank gems and unbottled =
musk,
the rooster will start to make up stories about how he fought in the =
war,
welded the sides of tanker ships, wore a shattered, sandy green army =
helmet.
Then no one will want to buy him, it's just a matter of timing.   Let =
him
stay and my lips will keep moving, turn the shapes of fortified roots, =
and I
can stay forever awake in the dark folds of nucleotides, always siding =
with
what is right, always siding.

Some want to hear more good stuff on Bruce Conner - maker of films, photographer, sculptor, painter, printmaker, occasional San Francisco politician, well, today in Leah Garchik's collumn:

 http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2008/07/11/DDI511LPR7.DTL

 In 1967, Conner ran for the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco. He described his business or occupation as "Nothing. My qualifications for said office are as follows: The light of the body is the eye; therefore when thine eye is single, they whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is dark, they body is full of darkness. Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness. If thy whole body be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light. For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known."

 Followed by a lovely conversational  account by Michael McClure of going from Kansas to NYC with Bruce Conner in their teens to up with Robert Motherwell in the summer of 1951, as well as accounts of his runs for the Board of Supervisors.

 Kenneth Baker's good piece on Connor the person(s), also  in today's Chron.

 Of course, for additional stuff, one can always Google!

Carol died? I  have some wonderful memories of that woman. This is a
postcard I received from Judson Crews, July 9, 1988:

"Back in US. I was suddenly reduced to nothing more than a 'local
poet.'Carol Bergé said to me, 'You ass-hole, what do you think? Do you think
the word does not get around?' I was so stunned it never occurred to me to
wonder 'what word'? But how stunningly true it seems more and more. My work,
absolutely is
better than it has ever been). But it is, almost, as if I were Rimbaud,
crawling back to Paris to die."

Best,
Joel

Thanks, Konrad. In fact, yesterday, I heard Conner had withdrawn his films over three different times in the course of his relationship with Canyon Cinema. Apparently a flip-flop tradition among a few others at Canyon Cinema, as well, including the long now disappeared Ben VanMeter who made such great stuff in the Sixties,

 And right, Good screen, good sound = best. Recently I heard Maurice Subotnik say the IPod has become the ultimate diminishment of an original, recorded perfomance. What seems like ultimate democracy (Ipod, Netflix, etc.) = pale horse, pale rider.

Used to be, but in fact Bruce's film have been out of
distribution for a year or so.  If i were to make an
educated guess, however, i would say that Canyon would
be the place to look for them in the not too distant
future.

Canyon Cinema: http://www.canyoncinema.com/
[nothing of Conner's there now]

You can click on something unauthorized on YouTube or
UbuWeb i'm sure.  You can also call me a film snob,
but i hope that people get to see the work in a
theater with good sound and picture.  If you see them
all compressed on your computer, it's like listening
to Bach on a transistor radio at the beach.  Easy to
think, "so what?"

have your students read this:

http://www.bookforum.com/inprint/015_02/2458

Then have them convey what literature they consider political.
Then ask them what elements give said literature a political nature.
What differentiates a political novel from an introspective one?
Private v. Public?

Just a thought

Passing the time with Boston Poet Laureate Sam Cornish.

Doug Holder

Sam Cornish, the Boston Poet Laureate, invited me to his office to chat b=
efore=20
participating in another meeting we were involved with later in the day w=
ith=20
Boston-area poetry activists. On the subway, on the way to the meeting, I=
=20
read through a collection of Cornish=92s that I picked up at the Grolier =
Poetry=20
Book Shop some time ago: =93Cross A Parted Sea.=94 Cornish writes about=20=

everything from Pullman Porters, sharecroppers, Jackie Robinson, Martin L=
uther=20
King, his father, etc. He does it with just the right amount of raw energ=
y and=20
the Blues, and his choice of words packs a wallop, or at times a well-
appointed sucker punch: Case in point:


Dog Town Slim

Our grandfathers
were=20

writers=20
that drank

of Mississippi

or to Spain

and the Krauts

that women

a music
called the blues.


Sam Cornish=92s office is in the back of the audiovisual department in th=
e=20
basement of the Copley Square Branch of the Boston Public Library. Cornis=
h is=20
an affable, warm, and modest man, making him an easy person to talk to an=
d=20
open up to. Cornish, like the former U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky, is=
 all=20
about community and outreach. From talking with Cornish I got the impress=
ion=20
he is not interested in getting more PR for the mandarins of the poetry w=
orld.=20
He wants to reach what he calls the =93Boston Underground,=94 which he de=
fines=20
as the community of poets and writers outside the academy. This is a=20
population who publishes little magazines and books, writes for the love =
of it=20
and are not careerists. He feels that these =93holy fools=94 should get s=
ome=20
recognition as well. Cornish wants to address the larger question =93Why =
does=20
poetry matter?=94 He wants show that poetry is an essential element of so=
ciety.=20
It is more than foundation grants, book contracts, and plum teaching posi=
tions.

Later Dales Patterson (Boston Library Foundation), Harris Gardner (Tapest=
ry of=20
Voices), Lo Galluccio (Poet Activist, Ibbetson Update Book Reviewer, and=20=

author),
Joe Bergin (Carpenter Poets), and Kate Finnegan (Kaji Aso Studios) came t=
o=20
discuss the process of getting grants for pet projects of Cornish=92s, an=
d other=20
proposed projects by group members. Some interesting ideas were thrown ou=
t=20
like: poetry performances at the old Strand Theatre in Dorchester, a smal=
l=20
press book fair, readings in coffee shops across the city, thematic cross=
-
cultural readings, paid visiting poets conducting workshops for neighborh=
ood=20
youth, you name it=85 Dale Patterson, a well-seasoned grant writer, plans=
 to=20
work up a draft proposal that hopefully will wind up in the willing hands=
 of a=20
number of foundations.

It was great to be with these enthusiastic folks who took time out of the=
ir=20
very busy lives to volunteer their respective talents in promotion of the=
 word.=20
Like Robert Pinsky, Sam Cornish is a great laureate, a man of the people,=
 and=20
his hands are on the pulse of the city. When I lived in Brighton years ag=
o I=20
used to see him walking the streets, his inquisitive, searching eyes scan=
ning=20
the city behind thick glasses. Cornish mentioned the book =93Walker in th=
e City,=94=20
by Alfred Kazin. Kazin was a keen observer, a lover of the ebb and flow o=
f the=20
eclectic, teeming city streets. This is exactly what Cornish is, and what=
 I=20
admire about the man. Cornish has walked the walk and he has earned the=20=

right to talk the talk.

I think Boston had the right idea supporting and funding this position. I=
 can=20
only hope that my hometown of Somerville will be infused with the same=20=

wisdom and fund a position such as this.

Now out from Salt Publishing: THEATRE by Alison Croggon

Alison Croggon's bold new collection, Theatre, uses a range of narratives,
fables, monologues and compressed lyrics to examine female identity and the
idea of divine experience. Stepping confidently between different registers
and a wide range of forms, Croggon's poetry shows a writer at the height of
her powers narrating a female world of folk tales, trials, challenges,
transgressions, and mythologies, where rites of passage are both linguistic=
,
spiritual and political, and where persona is stripped back to an essential
humility always journeying into fragile and impossibly beautiful worlds.

Available online at
http://www.saltpublishing.com/shop/proddetail.php?prod=3D9781844714186

Alison Croggon's poetry is distinguished by passion, intelligence and an
intense moral honesty that does not consist of statements about things, or =
a
drawing up of attitudes to this or that, but of a commitment to
understanding the ways poetry - the language of poetry - enables us to
understand. We have, as she says, "perfected the technologies of harm" and
will most likely carry on doing so. But the same prose poem, History, goes
on: "In unguarded moments I found myself longing for the dazzling conceits
of civilisation to be actual, for the profound and bloody pleasures which
underlay them." The marvellous sequence that ends the book, Translations
from Nowhere, itself ends with "an eyelid / snapping open, dazzled, full".
That fullness and that dazzling characterise all work.
- George Szirtes

Theatre is the apt title for such poems. Alison Croggon is gifted with a
rare capacity, negative capability: not so much, as for Keats, one that
allows the poet into the life of the sparrow on the gravel, but a capacity
to feel her way into the voices of others, from Iseult or Sor Juana to the
uncanny, unhomed voices of Translations from Nowhere. But as with the best
theatre, it is Croggon's care for language, its singularities and its
musics, that makes these poems inimitable. Through it all, an ummistakeable
note is sounded, wrapping through the many voices the tones of joy and
desolation, water and wind on stone.
- David Lloyd

To the mere spectator, it might appear that in this Theatre the poet is
delivering her lines. She is not! This is a theatre in which there is no
script, no actors, no representation. It is a place of first principles,
born from, and belonging to, the poet. From her stage there come no answers=
,
indeed, no questions. The latter are for you to ask yourself when you
realize and understand the complete lack of pretence in her words =96 "if I
have been asleep" =96

And like Alison Croggon, responsibly, I also want to wake up, remove my
masks, my costumes, and step out into the generative presence of real life.
Clearly, it is the poet's language that allows this. She knows that the
spotlight is never on the stage but, rather, on the audience: Her art's onl=
y
illumination is what it illuminates in you.
- MTC Cronin

 By MANOHLA DARGIS
 Bruce Conner's ecstatic films were at once salvage projects and assertions
of individuality in an increasingly anonymous age.


 in memory/memorium Bruce Connor--

I had the good fortune to meet Bruce Connors a number of times.  We talked
about the use of found materials and Assemblage, which are effective ways to
take very serious things such as atomic blasts and other "iconic images of
history" and turn them into comedy. ("Some things are so serious all one
can do about them is laugh"--Werner Heisenberg. This was also the time
period of Dr Strangelove, after all.)

The article notes Connor's citing the influence of the Marx Brothers, but
one may go much further back into the silent era--to the Lumiere Brothers
and Melies' uses of "trick effects"-- and later on, Buster Keaton.   For
example with his deadpan style (a "mock obectivity" in a sense)- would use
"documentary" materials to create "comic effects." In Keaton, the fictional
is simultaneously documentary as he designed the stunts and performed them,
which are "documented" as his passing through many levels of film,
projection, reality/documentary and fiction and dream.  ( In The Cameraman,
and Sherlock Jr especially, which has sequences rivalling any of the later
Surrealist classics.)

Joseph Cornell had worked much earlier in the use of assemblage &/found
materials in film, and Connor's films reminded me of a kind of very speeded
up approach to the dream-like associations which Cornell creates in his
boxes and movies.

The review notes Connor as a precursor to MTV--actually I think that TV had
a lot of influence on Connor's films, in the way that Richard Lester, who
made the Beatles' Hard Day's Night, came out of television and brought with
him the speeded up collision of action, images, comedy and a "documentary
feel" by filming on sight in an an unadorned, off the cuff manner,   At the
time, this was "slumming" in a sense was new to the movies, though a staple
of TV--and was fitting that it arrived in film with the Pop sensibilities of
the times,which one sees in the early Connor films.

I remember talking with Bruce Connor about the influence of advertising from
TV and film in his work.  My parents never had a TV (i didn't have one until
almost thirty, an old junker found on the street) so TV when  I saw it made
quite an impression.  The use of the strobe effects --which Dr Harold
Edgerton at MIT had been working on for a long time, his own documentary
fotos becoming considered as "Art"--(the famous drop of milk, or bullet
crashing through a board etc)--was a big thing--Brion Gysin and Burroughs
worked with something similar with flicker Dream Machines, and the police
had them already long in use, though for an effect quite opposite to what
filmmakers, writers, artists and psychedelians were after.

I think because he worked with Assemblage, writing about Connor, and
thinking back to talking with him--is like opening an immense trunk of
associations with other time periods in cinema, TV, photography and art,
"high," "low" and kitsch.

In a sense the films become launching pads for the viewer's own associations
of series of images, allusions, references, which like the flicker effect,
are both "there' and "not there<" yet also "there" in the sense of "after
images, after effects."  It sets up a Dream and Time Machine effect in the
vast storehouses of the Museum in the Mind so to speak, the Cinematheque of
the Photographic memory so to speak, the Archeology of the Vast Junkyards of
celluloid, IMAGE and reproductions that accumulates with such incredible
speed and in the process begins to create its own "memory movies" or what
Jack Kerouac, who wrote obsessively of Memory and Time, called in terms of
writing--"Book Movie, the original American form."

In a sense, watching a film like some of Connor's is actually being the
screen onto which the film is projected as one is watching it.  That is, the
film begins taking place "before one's very eyes" and starts to trigger
other images, ghostly, "after images," things there and not there, glimpsed
and then lost, a hide and seek flickering in the stroboscopes of the
viewer's own Cinema of Found Footages and Dusty Old Memories Dusted Off.

Some of the earliest film criticism made much of the going to the movies
experience as a way in which a large number of persons entered into a
darkness like sleep--and when the curtain went up so to speak, it was the
opening of the eyes of the consciousness present at the playing out of a
dream.

Using found footage and methods from Assemblage, Connor's films take
"popular images, icons of the culture" and play at once on their
"documentary" and "dream" qualities. This is a quality which has Haunted so
to speak Photography and Cinema since they each made their first appearances
before human eyes.  The range of effects from the Comic to the Tragic is
very vast indeed, and at the same time that distance can be "speeded up" by
the collisions of juxtapositions, montage, Assemblage and the kind of Pop
feeling that is already present in the Cubist paintings making use of chair
canings and newspaper ads, which themselves made use of the "documentary"
and "advertising" qualities of the photographic image.  In the Cinema of
Assemblage, as in Connor's films, one can see and learn how al these
elements  can be unpacked, repackaged and unpacked , deconstructed, all very
fast, "right before one's very eyes" and thus creating so often the Comic
effect.  The Newsreel turns into the old one reelers of Silent Comedy and
images perform a fast "action packed"   series of slapstick routines.

Like a Cornell box, a Connor film is a journey into an what I call the
Anarkeyology of Images, the Strata of Allusions and Associations which
"immediately recognizable" images and effects can trigger in the viewer's
consciousness, a Journey into the "Photographic Memory" of the Age of  Image
Saturation which makes use of a new language of Visual Shorthand,

The Visual Shorthand--greatly expanded by International Signs without Words
used in buildings, buses, trains, planes, bathrooms, elevator, just about
everywhere one looks--by its "pointing" to a word in a myriad different
languages--returns one to times before mass or common literacy, n which the
gigantic, incredibly complex Cosmologies of different spiritual traditions
are conveyed for the "instruction and delight" of the illiterate, who are
made in these way extremely literate in terms of the understanding of
communication-via-images, icons, signs, which, pre-Cinema and TV, creating
their own form of Conceptual Cinema in the mind of the viewer.  That is,
"reading" the visual signs, the visual shorthand, the viewer is taking
"still" images and galvanizing them --and at the same time, is galvanized by
these images-- into speeding trains of associations, allusions, concepts,
memories  The "illiterate" mind  itself becomes that Cinema into which the
spectator of the early essays on the Cinema-as- Dream- Theater walks. Since
the images and icons are collectively known, this proto-Cinematic viewer
experiences simultaneously a "personal" viewing and a collective one, just
as the cinema audience attends both a personal and a public cinema.

In Bruce Connor's films one finds articulated very clearly this combing of
the individual viewing of the images, icons, visual shorthand, and the
public, collective "attendance" of the spectator in the cinema.  The Cinema
of the individual mind and the Cinema of the "movie going public" are
"brought together" via his work with the art of Assemblage.  And they
gesture also to what is "built into" Assemblage--that is, in taking note of
the various objects, images, time periods, allusions which go into creating
the Assemblage, one begins while viewing to already anticipate if not
already beginning, to unpack the Assemblage and with each element find that
it is triggering a myriad new Assemblages in the memory, imagination and
thoughts.

An Assemblage as Film both "comes together" and "comes part"," while it is
"taking place," much as the strobe effect alternates between presenting an
image, and presenting its disappearance, in high speed succession. so that
even a completely "still image," when viewed by Assemblage or strobe,
becomes galvanized into a "Movie," a "Moving Picture," which in turn
produces the "moving effects" of emotions triggered into their own "actions
on and in the spectator, who becomes both a screen and an actor, and
eventually, via the galvanized associations of "Photographic Memory," a form
of Conceptual Director in the Cinema of the Mind.  (Which Andre Malraux
called "the Museum without Walls," that repository of images and image-junk
in the brain of the viewer/director/Assembler.)

To me what is part of the magic (which is also another early metaphor for
Cinema) of Connor's films is the way in which the Assemblage is such an
incredibly well packed and unpacking (like the Toni Basil film of her
mentioned in the review, dressed and undressed)--putting together//taking
apart of not only the Connor film itself that is "before one," but also of
the Cinema that is "within one."

 In this Assemblage,disassemblage/re-assemblage both on screen and in the
viewer's mind, there is an Assemblage of the experiences, memories,
concepts, history of the Movies and Movie-Going, and how these are
continually presenting an Anarkeyology of the "development" so to speak of
the Art of Looking.   Connor's films are often at  the same time teaching
one more about the History of Looking in terms of
photographic/cinematic/advertising/TV/art images and the inner history of
one's own many lives among these.

All these Assemblages "come together" and then--"depart" as a part of and
apart from the films.
And that ongoing Assemblage is the "legacy of Bruce Connor," an Assemblage
ongoing in his works and their effects in the Cinemas of the Mind of the
myriads of their viewers.
And that's how he is ongoing in the mind of memory also, in thinking of
him--not as a "stilled image," but as an ever ongoing "one," Assembled in
the remembered by myriads person of Bruce Connor and his "body of work."

Dear Eireene--

I keep thinking of Eisenstein's classic film STRIKE--
Eisenstein was very interested in/influenced by literature, including the
study of Chinese ideograms.
A study of a film like STRIKE is a guide to many forms of Modernist ways of
presenting a strike in its various stages of development.
Another useful guide from Eisenstein are his essays --among them for
example, in FILM ESSAYS "The Method of Making Workers' Films, " "Lessons
from Literature," "More thoughts on Structure" and esp "Perspectives."

All of these are concerned with a dialectics of presenting the political
clearly and at the same time not neglecting his very deep concerns with
form.

He uses often examples drawn from political life- such as orators and their
differing uses of language, rhetorics, volumes  and tones of voice, the uses
of face and gesture to convey meanings and emotions, and how this is to be
conveyed via the medium of film, which for him is drawn in many ways from
writing and song.

Mayakovsky's "How are Verses Made" is also excellent in this  regard--

(the drawback of especially the latter for students might be Mayakovsky's
Communism--though Mayakovsky is every bit as flamboyant and fascinating
charismatic a figure as Che--as you know--and so that might mitigate the
circumstances of the ideology--who knows?

Actually there's some excellent reportage and writing on strikes and picket
lines, which makes use of real and  fictional persons, documentary materials
in "News Reels" and subjective viewpoints in the "Camera Eye" sections-- and
the first hand experience of the author--in an American context--John Dos
Passos' USA trilogy.

In the "Newsreels" Dos Passos combines popular songs of the time, newspaper
headlines, faits divers, strange weather, a multitude of simultaneous "news
items" in order to give a "movie" "take" on the events in which the
characters are involved--among the most focused on being organizing and
strikes, writing of reports and propaganda leaflets, and pamphlets
explaining reasons for actions, as well as he provides many bios of Labor
leaders and agitators which are very inspiring--people like Big Bill
Heywood, etc--

The picketing and protests by millions around the world during the Sacco and
Vanzetti Trials also plays a big part.

There are also a lot of Labor newspapers from various points of view that
are easy to find and the Catholic Worker which often has very good reporter
on picketing and strikes.

These give a kind of shorthand of how to present the reasons for the strike,
the unions and companies involved, the major issue at stake for that
immediate community and the wider scope often brought in today of
Globalization and Global Warming and how these are related to a specific
place, event, population and the environment socially, economically and
ecologically.

Another factor to bring up is the psychological morale of strikers--what
their emotions and hopes or despairs are in the current situation, what they
look forward to being "happier about" if they win some ground, and what they
risk "feeling alot worse about" if their demands are not meant, or only
minimally.

Once you establish this "setting" s to speak, it becomes a series of
decsisions on the writer's part which aspects they choose to handle in
"close up"--how they want to frame within the frame individuals of groups of
persons, how to show the interplay of conflicting forces--how a strike is
also a form of street theater--with its own given rhetoric's, uses of signs,
costumes, music, marches or standings--

Any form of strike or picketing today requires a discussion or presentation,
even if very brief, of the issues at stake both in the specific site, and
how this fits into a series of "pictures" national and international, since
the globalized economy, as well the workers, are trying to balance a
simultaneous fragmentation with an overwhelming force that tries to draw
everything into tighter and tighter concentrated centralization's of funding
and power.

Speaking of funding--what funds do the picketers draw on while on
strike--how does this play into the length of time they have the ability to
strike without hardships beginning?  How does this effect the bargaining and
negotiations?

A lot of strikes also got turned into songs and some into poems--so labor
songs and union and protest songs are a another way of studying how to write
of the events.

Since what is being undertaken is a collective event made up of many
individual decisions, just going around interviewing people with the
information one has is a good way to intermix the personal, subjective
"human interest" aspects against the "greater picture and background" of the
effort as a whole.

A lot of really good ways to get some ideas are to look for articles or
books which have to do with strikes also in terms of issues which are both
about the work place and larger issue--for example from Feminist history,
Civil rights history, student protests and strikes, any kind of specific
demography oriented action to see how a strike is handled in being written
about when it is involving more than one issue--any strike may have several
issues involved, of which the one in the workplace is but a way to focus al
of them and set them all into movement as --a Movement.

The "street theater" aspect means that in writing of events such as
picketing, one wants to, as do the strikers and their opponents, dramatize
the issues and person, the sights, sounds, smells, situations.  Since a
strike and picketting are literally part of a sturggle for power and wages,
for a future better than the present, drama practically leaps out as a
method of approaching the writing.  This doesn't mean necessarily
"heightening" in a purple prose way, but the making use of even facts and
figures as "characters" "playing apart in the action."

In that way, every sign, sound, interview, notation of how the time spent on
the lines is spent and what is being discussed on site in terms of the
"progress" or 'standstill" of the Movement's movements--al of these things
became "players" on the stage, and one can use them in a wide variety of
ways--

On the one hand, one is making a documentary, on the other, a dramatized
version from one's subjective point of view.  Finding  the ways to have
these work together and play them off each other is where the 'drama," the
struggle of the writer" goes on.

The piece then is the drama combined of the writer's struggle to give the
writing a form that the writer finds effective, and of the strike and
pickets' struggle to find the most effective form for their expressions of
their desires and demands to  most effectively and completley as possible
realize these.

The writer's struggle are one way of gving a sense of the drama of the
street theater struggle as a dialectics, a point couterpoint, a contrapuntal
compostion so to speak.

I hope soehwere here there's something a bituseful at least to start more
ideas of your own and your students--

Oh--there's Dickens novel also about a strike--i read long ago, but pretty
sure is called Hard Times.

It's very good as i recall, and not in the sentimental Dickensian style at
all--until the very end,when it resorts to his proto-"Hollywood ending"
tendency, which was also dictated by the nature in which the book
appeared--as a serial, again if i recall correctly.

But then in a strike and picketing--one is after all hoping for a form of
"living happily after" much older than a "Hollywood ending."

(And consider the effect that the writers' strikes have had on Hollywood--!)

My BARGE project BURIED TREASURE ISLAND opens this Saturday at YBCA as part=
 of the Ground Scores exhibition, an off-site section of the Bay Area Now 5=

Buried Treasure Island - BARGE (the Bay Area Research Group in Enviro-aesth=
etics)
Given Treasure Island's long and complex history as an artificial staging g=
round for world's fairs, military bases, television shoots, and real estate=
 speculation, as well as being an enormous landfill of dangerous and toxic =
substances, "Buried Treasure Island" attempts to unearth the secret histori=
es of the site, and explore how the landscape is transformed not only by it=
s usage, but also by what is elided from public view. Home to some of the m=
ost stunning views in the bay (but only if you turn your back on the island=
 itself), Treasure Island remains a site full of hidden histories, presents=
, and possible futures. The work is presented in several overlapping iterat=
ions: installation, guidebook, self-guided tour, audio podcast, songs, perf=
ormative bus tour, staged actions and photographs, and online. That some po=
ssible Treasure Island =E2=80=9Citself=E2=80=9D may be buried somewhere wit=
hin the constellation of these versionings, between site and non-site, real=
ities and representations, is a question that the work attempts to confront=
.

writer of American miniatures, artful distillations of our humor and
humanity."
The New York Times

"Hawkins is keenly aware of the complicated vastness of even just one
little human universe. Her writing participates in a tradition of
American modernism in prose that achieves an almost hallucinatory
precision.'

Virgin are out to destroy the World Wide Web. Virgin Media have recently announced that they don't care about net neutrality and are going to start controlling the quality of their users internet service, depending on whether the websites they are trying to access are paying Virgin a high premium or not.
This means that if you say, went to the Virgin Media website, you would get a very fast speeds like any normal time you spend on the World Wide Web. But if you tried to access a website like YouTube that are not paying Virgin a fee, the website will load very slowly. So slow that you won't even feel like using that site, and may prefer to use another.
Traffic Shaping like this is wrong. It gives Virgin the power to stop people accessing websites that they don't believe in. People may never be able to speak their mind on the internet again if the corporations that fund Virgin don't see fit.
How does this effect me? Right now, the only people that will be effected by these money making tactics are Virgin Media customers. If we don't stop Virgin Now though, all other Internet Providers will see that they can get away with privatising their services too.
The World Wide Web as it is now, is almost like a giant social network. People meet and share experiences on websites every day, but if Virgin have their way this will not be the case anymore. The World Wide Web as we know it will be gone forever. Will you be part of the generation that let the Web die?

David,

The sad fact is that since Ronald Reagan's busting of airline operators
union, striking is dead in The United States. If a group strikes, most of
the population will not even know what it is. Of course, globalization, the
strategic weakness for labor it represents, also has something to do with
it.

Of course, in the 19th century Europe, and also in the Algerian liberation
movement, for instance, strikes had a different function from wresting
specific concessions from the management. General strikes were strategic
moves to bring a crisis to a boiling point, a destructive/creative function
to achieve revolutionary change. There are very interesting movies inwhich
the idea of strike in this second sense hovers over the whole action and
takes place *after* the movie ends -or about to end- as a prophetic action.
*The Battle of Algiers* is a great example of it in which, ironically, the
commander of the French forces by his paramilitary methods is successful in
eradicating the Algerian revolutionary cells, while the Algerian populace,
in the ululating voices of its women, is developing a revolutionary
consciousness. The epilogue of the movie refers to a general strike in the
country which occurs "out of nowhere" a few years later and ends the French
rule. A similar movie is Godard's *La Chinoise *where the humorless and
slightly silly antiques of a Maoist cell composed mostly French teen age
student intellectuals discussing (two of them practicing) general strikes,
assasinations and political suicides anticipate the Paris student revolt of
the following (?) year. Throughout the movie, the statement (I am
paraphrasing) "Politics is the art of seeing clearly" is visible, written on
the wall in the background.

Walter Benjamin's *The Arcades Project* has long sections on barricades and
Husmann's efforts to fight them.

The United States puts this idea of strike on its head by an equally
striking idea, "What is good for General Motors is good for the country."
Consequently, today, the Midwest and General Motors are going together down
the drain.

Ciao,

Murat

Please Forward.  Thanks!

Recruiting Student Teachers for June Jordan's Poetry for the People

The Poetry for the People Program (P4P) at UC Berkeley, founded by the
late poet/essayist June Jordan, is in its seventeenth year. June Jordan
founded the program with a vision of artistic and personal empowerment for
students.

Our an annual large class is offered in the Spring semester. The program
has two main components:

1.teaching the work of poets of color in their historical political
contexts, both in and outside the US

2.workshopping student poems weekly, according to a rigorous set of
guidelines developed by June, herself.

The course is taught by Student Teacher Poets or STPs. This group is
generally made up mostly of undergraduates, but has often included some
graduates, graduate students and non-students. The majority of STPs
have taken the large P4P class, but others begin with an interest in
teaching and go directly to the STP class. The STPs take a practicum
class that begins in the Fall and continues throughout the year.

In addition to leading or co-leading a section of 7-12 students in the
Spring, the STPs are responsible for choosing the majority of the
readings for the large Spring class, developing the bulk of the
lectures, and coordinating the final student recital, editing an
anthology, and doing outreach visits to schools and community centers
throughout the year. STPs also workshop each other's poetry.

The director facilitates the STP group throughout the year, and
supervises their work, and the program coordinator takes care of program
logistics. The director also sets the tone of the large class, delivers
several lectures, and supports the STPs in their teaching and
leadership.

The political and aesthetic groundings of the course come from June
Jordan's own work--reflecting the tradition of women writers of color
needing to bear witness to oppression, to speak what has been silenced,
to speak truth to power, and to offer alternative visions of what the
world can be. In this tradition, the personal is political, students
are encouraged to give voice in their poetry to the most painful and
difficult places in their lives, and to speak about the most difficult
challenges in the world around us.

Due to the personally, politically, and academically intense nature of
the course, the experience of P4P is powerful for all, and can be
consuming for some, particularly younger students who are finding their
poetic voice for the first time. Among the STP group, every year is
different, depending on the personalities involved, but there is a
tradition of healthy (and sometimes unhealthy!) conflict, as the group
of STPs endeavor to take political and artistic leadership in the
course. STPs have the opportunity for profound personal growth as they
confront the power dynamics, leadership challenges and significant
responsibilities of teaching.

P4P director Aya de Leon is recruiting additional STPs. These
individuals may be undergraduate or graduate students at other campuses,
or anyone with a strong commitment to writing and teaching poetry.

The STP course meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4-6PM throughout the
year, and the P4P "big class" meets from 3-7PM in the Spring. STPs need
to be available for all three classes, for registered students, this is
a 12-unit load over two semesters.
STUDENT TEACHING TIME COMMITMENT:

The STP course meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 4-6PM throughout the
year, and the P4P "big class" meets from 3-7PM in the Spring. STPs need
to be available for all three classes, plus homework and occasional
outside meetings. For registered students, this is a 12-unit load over
two semesters.

These positions are not paid, but we can offer college credit to everyone.

How to get college credit for these classes:

*enroll via UC Berkeley in the courses (both undergraduate & grad programs)

*cross register from Mills College (both undergraduate & MFA)

*enroll via Berkeley City College (open to all & affordable!)

*enroll via UCB extension (open to all; a bit more costly)

*Student teach as an independent study at your college or university (grad
or undergrad)

*Student teach as an independent study or field study placement with your
low residency MFA program

All are invited to apply!

P4P Program History

After a decade of teaching at the university level and after a few years
of joining the faculty at UC Berkeley, Professor June Jordan, one of the
most published African American writers in history, founded, designed,
cultivated and directed an unprecedented academic course and artistic
movement: Poetry for the People.

Professor Jordan wrote, however, that "I did not wake up one morning
ablaze with a coherent vision of Poetry for the People! The natural
intermingling of my ideas and my observations as an educator, a poet, and
the African-American daughter of poorly documented immigrants did not lead
me to any limiting ideological perspectives or resolve. Poetry for the
People is the arduous and happy outcome of practical, day-by-day,
classroom failure and success."

In 1989, June Jordan began teaching in the African American Studies and
Women's Studies Departments. She soon undertook the presentation of
African American Poetry and Contemporary Women's Poetry. With both
courses, she ensured that student writings occupied equal space and time,
along with established poets, such as James Weldon Johnson or Adrienne
Rich.
Eventually, she decided to offer something called "Poetry for the People."
So she raised funds from the African American Studies Department, the Dean
of Interdisciplinary Studies, and the Department of English.

Her dream and vision was realized in 1991 when Professor Jordan officially
established Poetry for the People. During its first semester, and every
semester thereafter, the course attracted students from Freshmen to
graduate students in their last year at Boalt Law School, men, women,
African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, Arab Americans,
Anglo Americans, gay, lesbian, straight, abled, disabled who could take
this course in poetry without any prior writing experience.

June Jordan crafted Poetry for the People with three guiding principles in
mind:

1.That students will not take themselves seriously unless we who teach
them, honor and respect them in every practical way that we can.

2.That words can change the world and save our lives.

3.That poetry is the highest art and the most exacting service devoted to
our most serious, and our most imaginative, deployment of verbs and nouns
on behalf of whatever and whoever we cherish.

Professor Jordan's vision for the reading and writing of poetry stands out
from other university poetry courses. In an interview with the Daily
Californian on November 19, 1998, Professor Jordan stated that the goal of
Poetry for the People "is to make audible the inaudible, and visible the
invisible."

Then, after the success of the third semester of the program, a core of
young poets wanted to make P4P a way of life. As a result, Professor
Jordan decided to try and institute a course called "The Teaching and
Writing of Poetry." Interested students would work closely with her and
then they, in turn, would become teachers of other students. This practice
continues today as undergraduates and graduate students are trained by the
director to facilitate groups, lecture on various topics, and assume
positions of leadership.

African American Studies 158A (fall) and 158B (spring) serve as this
teaching practicum for STPs in the process of preparing to student teach
the main introductory spring class, African American Studies 156AC, known
as "The Big Class." The students in these courses conduct extensive
research into the poetic traditions under consideration for the Big Class.
Each student is required to give an in-class presentation on an assigned
poetic tradition, in addition to an intensive examination of pedagogical
issues. Much of the time in the spring is spent discussing teaching
strategies, exploring solutions to pedagogical issues, and coordinating
projects. The STPs also form and facilitate a poetry-writing group under
the Director's leadership and complete all the assignments the students in
the general class are given, in addition to certain specific exercises in
poetic craftsmanship. This group of STPs also provides personnel for the
various outreach programs and is encouraged to perform at community events
and readings in the Bay Area.

The success of P4P is evidenced by the dozens of poetry programs across
the country that are led by former P4P students and whose designs are
based on the program. In 1995, after Professor Jordan and several of her
students published June Jordan's Poetry for the People: A Revolutionary
Blueprint through Routledge Press, hundreds of organizations throughout
the country have adopted this blueprint not only as a reference but a
guiding principle in their own poetry workshops and programs. Moreover,
numerous former P4P students have been anthologized, published, and
celebrated with prizes.

Thus, from its humble beginnings of around 15-20 students in 1991, to its
height of over 130 student enrollment, the once-tenuous experiment of
Poetry for the People has emerged a cultural institution on the UC
Berkeley campus that has engendered dialogue and created connections
across every conceivable line.

Professor Jordan has said, "Poetry has been falsely viewed as a province
for privileged folks and for the extremely gifted. [But] poetry derives
from an oral tradition throughout the world. It comes from the people and
needs to be given back to the people."

Today, Poetry for the People is a fully accredited, three course sequence
of classes wherein students present their work in an on-campus public
poetry reading every semester and self-produce and then publish a
professional anthology of their poems. In keeping with the university's
goal of public education, Professor June Jordan expanded this program to
many different Bay Area locations: Berkeley High School, Dublin Women's
Prison, Glide Memorial Church, Mission Cultural Center, and Yerba Buena
Center for the Arts.

Every poetry reading she helped organize was a standing room only affair =
=97
in mammoth campus spaces such as the Life Valley Science Building Lecture
Halls, Lewis Hall, and Wheeler Auditorium.

In 2001, Professor June Jordan went on leave. However, given the student
demand for the course and the popularity of the program, she was asked to
name a successor. Selected by Professor Jordan, Junichi P. Semitsu
directed the program until 2005. In 2005-06 P4P alum, Maiana Minahal was
director. In fall 2006, the African American Studies department appointed
community artist and activist Aya de Leon as director, and her appointment
continues into its third year.

Aya de Leon continues in Jordan's tradition of reaching beyond university
walls, developing programming at Berkeley High, B-Tech (Berkeley High's
alternative/ continuation school), Oakland Unified, Berkeley City College,
Epic Arts, La Pena Cultural Center, and Richmond's Leadership Public
School, as well as reaching out to Mills College, SF State, Foothill
College, and other Bay Area schools to recruit students.

The Program has continued to bring countless "hot shot poets" to campus
for readings to P4P students and the general public: Adrienne Rich,
Ntozake Shange, Jimmy Santiago Baca, Joy Harjo, Sandra Cisneros, Juan
Felipe Herrera, Bei Dao, Janice Mirikitani, Ruth Forman (a former P4P
student), Marilyn Chin, Haas Mroue, Martin Espada, Cornelius Eady, Lorna
Dee Cervantes, E. Ethelbert Miller, Sekou Sundiata, Kevin Young, Dennis
Kim, Leroy Quintana, Li-Young Lee, Naomi Shihab Nye, Francisco Alarcon,
Sara Miles, Donna Masini, Luis Rodriguez, Tyehimba Jess, Mohja Khaf =97 to
name a few.

The current ever-evolving syllabus continues to extend to new cultural
areas for further, broadening research and eventual curricular inclusion.
Designed to constitute a one-semester crash course of world literacy in
poems, the syllabus typically focuses on three distinct American cultures,
which often rotate year after year. Our Spring 2008 semester focused on
the poetry of African Americans, Arab and Arab Americans, Latina/os,
Xicana/os, and the intersecting trajectories of these three groups in the
United States and the Americas.

Professor Jordan passed away in June 2002. Thanks to her vision and the
commitments of the African American Studies Department, UC Berkeley's
Dean's office, and the sustained efforts of subsequent directors and
student teachers to continue her legacy, the African American Studies
156AC course remains strong and alive. Indeed, the class continues to
build a legacy as one of the most visible, vibrant, and energetic
communities on the Berkeley campus, in continuing Dr. Martin Luther King's

Second Nature: Call for Papers and projects

Second Nature: The International Journal of Creative Media is an open
access, peer-reviewed online journal auspiced by RMIT's School of
Creative Media. Second Nature explores the distinctive particulars of
and interconnections between textual, visual, aural and interactive
creative research and practices.

The journal's editorial board seeks papers and online projects for its
first issue.

As the journal is multiple-media in focus we welcome contributions from
across the field of creative media including creative writers, media and
art historians, media practitioners and fine artists, architects and
architectural theorists and historians, curators, museum professionals,
scientists, cultural and media theorists, archivists, technologists,
software developers, educationalists, philosophers and any others who
have a stake in the understanding and future developments of creative
media. Projects might include web-based interactives, net-art, games,
suites of 2D imagery, video and sound works, fiction, critical and
non-fiction writing. Both projects and papers will be peer-reviewed.

Deadline:
30th August, 2008: Papers and projects

Issue 1.
Role Models
The inaugural issue of Second Nature will examine creative practice as a
contested site of inscription. It will contest traditional concepts of
the creator's role as one of  'writing' the world that, despite
continual challenges to its hegemony, persists in the popular
imagination. Whilst past challenges from cultural theorists have
remained largely theoretical in approach, new developments in
technologies and communications are rapidly changing the creative
landscape. 'Creativity' and 'innovation' are seen as the drivers of
future First World economies and the 'cultural industries' account for a
substantial proportion of First World GNP. Ironically, less and less
Government and corporate support seems to be available for independent,
creative research.

Papers and projects addressing, but not limited to, some or all of the
following questions are invited:

*	Can traditional views of 'the creator' withstand these new
developments? What role/s will the creative practitioner play in this
changing cultural, economic, social and environmental landscape?

*	What kinds of creative spaces and practices are available in an
increasingly corporatised brand-driven world?

*	How has the globalization of labour and markets affected the
cultural and geographical specificity of creative output.

*	What role will the academy play as a site of creative research?

*	How will the romantic notion of the artist be redefined in the
new globalism of the 21st century?

*	Is it all about the market? Are other values driving the
development of media and practices?

*	How are new distribution channels affecting what becomes public,
how it is consumed and how it is understood?

*	What is the affect of user-generated media on traditional
practices and distribution?

*	Can crowd-sourcing, folksonomies and the wisdom of crowds
replace the roles of gatekeeper, editor, curator, director etc?

*	What affect has rise of intellectual protectionism and
particularly the extension of copyright, trademarking and patenting
opportunities had on practitioners and practice?

*	How do the ambitions of 'research' apply to creative practice?
Can practice be said to generate 'new' information (with its material
overtones of quantifiability and universality), or is the information
and understanding generated through producing, consuming and/or
interacting with creative works of a completely different order?

*	What are the problems of a 'too useful art'? In the rush to
claim a use value for art (research questions based on empirical models;
claims of art's/creativity's economic benefits), is there a risk of
denigrating the idea of culture for culture's sake and of stifling
necessary uncertainty within the creative process.

*	Does a culture of user-generated content and democratic
dissemination of cultural products weaken traditional institutions such
as universities and museums? Or can it lead to a justification for
'high' or 'elite' cultures?

*	Creativity and innovation are being touted as future drivers of
First World economies, but what difference (if any) exists between the
two? Can innovation be seen as the commodification of creative
expression? And if so, does this spell danger for creative outcomes that
don't have a pre-defined purpose?

*	How has the hegemony and globalisation of culture affected
creative expression within developing or politically 'weak' economies?

*	Is the global market itself distorting the intentions as well as
the outcomes of creative expression?

Completed papers should be no more than 10,000 words. Short articles
(1500-3000 words) are warmly encouraged. Any images included must have
Copyright clearance or be the intellectual property of the author/s.
Deadline: August 30, 2008

Abstracts and papers should be submitted as Microsoft Word documents
saved as .doc or .rtf.

Submitted projects must be formatted for viewing and interaction in a
web browser. In exceptional cases projects may be presented to download
(e.g as executable applications). Please contact the editor at the email
address below if you would like to discuss suitable formats and file
sizes.

Submissions and inquiries should be made to the editor Shiralee Saul
shiralee.saul@rmit.edu.au
Forthcoming issues for 2009 include:
Amnesiac Culture will examine the complex issues surrounding personal
and cultural memory.
Code Makers will examine contemporary understandings of reality as
embodied information structures.

(Hard to believe he actually won the case, I still keep thinking the =20

miserable.  ~mIEKAL)

July 12, 2008


Dear Supporters,

After four long, difficult years I have been released from my legal =20
ordeal. I want to thank everyone who supported me through this=97the =20
greatest challenge I=92ve ever had to face. I feel vindicated today =20
because I am innocent, but today I am also humbled by a legal and =20
political victory that is not mine alone. Everyone who contributed =20
their support to this case can lay claim to a victory against the =20
forces aiming to abridge our fundamental rights. I am mindful that my =20=

case was just one of many examples where fear and irrationality gained =20=

the upper hand after 9/11. I am aware that my vindication is an =20
exception. I continue to have anxiety about the outcome of many =20
pending cases still awaiting justice.

Although it seems that my case has come to a conclusion, it is only =20
now that I can fully comprehend the immensity of what happened. The =20
tragic death of Hope was a profound loss. The unfortunate events =20
following Hope=92s death occurred at a moment of intense pain and =20
sadness for all of us. Neither my life nor the work of Critical Art =20
Ensemble has been the same without her. If she were here today, I know =20=

she would be proud of everything that has been done by all the people =20=

involved. Collectively, we stood without flinching, and defeated a =20
monster of social injustice. Hope always said that we should =93never =20=

surrender=94 to authoritarian power, and we didn=92t.

I was extremely fortunate to have a team of people immediately form a =20=

defense group at the very beginning, when I was still in shock. I want =20=

to thank the members of the CAE Defense Fund for coming to my defense =20=

from the beginning of the ordeal.

Throughout the past four years, so many people raised their voices in =20=

my defense, and that of my friend and co-defendant, Robert Ferrell. So =20=

many contributed time, energy, and resources. We could not have =20
adequately defended ourselves without the labor and activism of =20
thousands=97individuals, groups, artists and activists. I am grateful to =
=20
everyone who donated their work and talent to fundraisers for our =20
legal defense. And although I cannot thank everyone by name, to all of =20=

you worldwide who helped organize fundraisers, letter writing =20
campaigns, conferences, teach-ins, protests and other events, your =20
actions made a real difference in this case.

To all my friends, thank you for helping me through my darkest hours.

To everyone, please accept my humble offer of thanks. I am grateful. I =20=

owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to all of you for seeing me through =20=

this terrible period.

Please remember also that this case was about so much more than just =20
keeping me out of jail. This is a great legal and political victory =20
that will affect many cases to come. Through its prosecution of this =20
case, the Department of Justice was hoping to expand the most broadly =20=

written law on the books (mail fraud) into an all-encompassing =20
Leviathan that could be used at its discretion against any citizen at =20=

any time. Not only did we prevent this dangerous expansion of the law, =20=

the precedent we set has narrowed it. Because of our collective =20
effort, a bogus charge like the one targeting Bob and me is unlikely =20
ever to happen again=97and if it were to happen, any competent attorney =20=

could easily shoot it down.

What have I learned from my ordeal? I=92ve learned that with tens of =20
thousands of supporters, with hundreds of thousands of dollars, with =20
one of the best legal teams in the US, with a crack media team, with a =20=

group of experienced fundraisers, with four years of one=92s life, and =20=

with total innocence, sometimes one can slice off a piece of American =20=

justice. Which in the end means: The overwhelming majority of people =20
ain=92t gettin=92 justice, and we have to keep fighting until they do.


With Sincerity, Gratitude, and Appreciation,



Steven Kurtz=

Featuring the works of Micah Ballard, Jeffrey Schrader, and Chad Sweeney

WHAT:
How does where you are from influence your body of work? Please join us as
poets Micah Ballard, Jeffrey Schrader, and Chad Sweeney ponder the meaning
of "home" and bring the house down in this new edition of the Canessa
Gallery reading series.

Micah Ballard is co-editor, with Sunnylyn Thibodeaux, of Auguste Press.
Recent books include: Bettina Coffin (Red Ant), Emblematic (Old Gold),

MFA in Writing program at the University of San Francisco.

Jeffrey Schrader has been involved in the Uglyman Collective, Another
Publishing, Cricket Online Review & many other do-it-yourself failures &
experiments. To date, the finest job he ever held was as a bicycle messenger
for an urban ecology non-profit that successfully reduced the number of
single-passenger vehicles driven in various Bay Area communities. He lives
with Sherri and Milena at the edge of downtown Oakland's current
gentrification project. Chapbooks include Speak at Every Hazard and The Man
at the Other End of the Bench; grid/pattern is forthcoming from Erg. He's
currently working on a window garden of carnivorous plants and the regular
mechanics of 1970s era single-speed bicycles.

Chad Sweeney is co-editor of Parthenon West Review and is the author of An
Architecture (BlazeVOX, 2007), Arranging the Blaze (Anhinga, 2009), and A

 The latest brouhaha involving cultural property is unfolding in Lisbon =97
and not, for a change, over stolen vases or precious war booty, but a poet'=
s
correspondence.

An amazing fact emerges--that there are 30 trunks of Pessoa's writings to b=
e
gone through, poured over, in search of Treasure.

How many more heteronyms may yet emerge from these receptacles of "as yet
unknown writings"?

Are families related to the heteronyms of a writer?  Is a culture?

SEE THE VOICE:  Visible Verse 2008 call for videopoems

Pacific Cin=E9math=E8que and curator Heather Haley are seeking videopoem su=
bmissions from around the world for the annual Visible Verse screening and =
performance poetry celebration, Nov. 6, 2008.  Visible Verse is North Ameri=
ca's sustaining venue for the presentation of new and artistically signific=
ant videopoetry.

Official guidelines:

*Visible Verse seeks videopoems, with a 15 minutes maximum duration.

*Either official language of Canada is acceptable, though if the video is i=
n French, an English-dubbed or-subtitled version is required for considerat=
ion. Videos may originate in any part of the world, however.

*Pieces will be judged on true literary merit. The ideal videopoem is a wed=
ding of word and image, the voice seen as well as heard.

*Please, do not send documentaries, as they are outside the featured genre.

*Videopoem producers should provide a brief bio, full name, and contact inf=
ormation in a cover letter. There is no official application form nor entry=

Because I think we (working or once working poets) are surrounded by stuff (archives), I am wondering about the art of either keeping or killing portions of it and (if it goes anywhere) what may be appropriate ways to either draw attention or limit its use.

 Fundamentally my question is who determines - or who is in the best postion to determine what may be the ultimate critical/biographical etc. value of a poet's stuff. Are poets in a position to say what in their entire archive (books, correspondence (from love or hate letters, to critcial discussions with peers. distant relatives), manuscripts and revisions, desks, tennis shoes,  etc.  Do we or our executors, for example, have the right to make correspondence from otthers part of a library's public record.

 Why is it worth while to see Ginsberg's tennis shoes. Or, does it become worthwhile if there is diary entry in which Corso or Burroughs advises G to buy X brand of shoe and why. This info may feed the person who is writing an anecdote filled biography, perhaps, so the shoe is essential, perhaps, as a way of getting to use, aesthetic and a tangible sense of comraderie.

 Is there any written 'code of established, ethical, etc. conduct here. Or, like the art world, are literary archives a wilderness unto themselves. The way they get organized (or don't), the ways they are acquired, or the ways in which they are assembled and sold quite various, depending on a mix of  interests/values of the acquiring institution and those of the  author or his heirs.

 On one extreme some folks will give everything up (valuable to potentially embarassing) and let future 'scholarly' hands shape history out of the dispersal. While others will do everything they can to carefully how they are received by the  critics of the future.

 The way a poet (and/or his executors) provide an archive to a library strikes me as potentially as artful as the construction of the original work and shape of the career.   Somewhat similarly, a Library can take that archive and organize and present its contents according to a value system that may be totally at odds with  poet. (Will Ginsberg's ever look at home at Stanford - that Protestant mecca of the West. Columbia U or NY Public Library's eternal loss??)

 I used to watch Ed Dorn sit in The Pub (corner of Masonic and Geary in San Francisco) as he would take out his pen and make drawings, or jot down a phrase or two on a partially wet napkin. He could do a pretty good caricature of a parody of a cowboy. (He was finishing up the Gunslinger at the time. (1975 or so).
 I forget if he kept those sketches. I hope they remain in his archive. Definitely good 'period pieces'.

 Some summer thinking here,

Subject:      New from Cuneiform: 3 by Ted Greenwald
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Cuneiform is pleased to announce the publication of 3, Ted Greenwald's
latest masterpiece.

Poet Ron Padgett writes: Ted Greenwald's 3 takes the mind in at least three
different directions simultaneously, in hardboiled, richly detailed,
well-made poems whose giddy wordplay, pantoum-like interweavings, and nimble
jumpcuts create a sort of 21st-century Poet in New York. An inspired
challenge and a delight.

Filmmaker Nathanial Dorsky writes: Within this selection of three works, we
come upon the most unusual, if not revolutionary moment in the universe
called Ted Greenwald. Suddenly the risk of self as such takes place. Though
his poetry always bares the honest song of a fragmented accumulation, the
float of our existence, here Ted reveals an exposition of tender, romantic
suchness amidst rhythmic refrains classically structured and filled with
sunlight and place, the vulnerable underbelly of his Arcadian being is
unveiled.

And poet Tom Raworth reminds us to "Just read the fucking book."

The cover was designed by typographic aficionado Rich Kegler of P22. Trade
paperbacks are $15 (plus $2.50 domestic shipping) and the lettered and
signed hardcovers are available for $50 (plus $2.50 domestic shipping). Both
editions are distributed by our friends at Small Press Distribution
www.spdbooks.org or direct from www.cuneiformpress.com.

Other recent books from Cuneiform include: Bill Berkson's Sudden Address;
Ron Silliman's Woundwood; Gregg Biglieri's Sleepy with Democracy; Dan
Featherston's Clockmaker's Memoir; and Ted Greenwald and Hal Saulson's
collaboration Two Wrongs. All are available from SPD www.spdbooks.org or
direct from Cuneiform at www.cuneiformpress.com.

Dear Poet,
=20
As you may have heard, the Colrain Poetry Manuscript Conference,
designed for poets with a book-length manuscript, has been a tremendous
success, drawing accomplished poets from all over the country and
overseas. This conference has been created for poets who are either
ready to publish a book-length (or chapbook-length) manuscript or who
feel they need a reality check on their current manuscript-in-progress.
Since our first conference, in March of 2006, over 20 poets have had
their manuscripts accepted for publication. Colrain publication news is
found here <http://www.colrainpoetry.com/omnis-news.htm> .=20
=20
On August  22, 2008, the thirteenth group of poets will meet in Colrain,
Massachusetts. The conference will last three days and includes Jeffrey
Levine, editor and publisher of Tupelo Press, Jeffrey Shotts, poetry
editor of Graywolf Press, Frederick Marchant, Director of the Suffolk
University Creative Writing Program and Joan Houlihan, conference
founder and Director of Concord Poetry Center.=20
=20
Complete information and application can be found here:=20
=20
http://www.colrainpoetry.com/August
=20
The Colrain Poetry Manuscript conference is designed to place poets on a
realistic path toward book publication. If you feel you have a
manuscript ready for publication, if you have received a rejection and
don't know why, if your manuscript has achieved finalist or
semi-finalist standing in a contest, or if you simply want to gain an
understanding of how publishers and editors work behind the scenes
before submitting your manuscript, then this conference is for you.=20

I hope you will join us!=20

up by a publisher."
Steve Fellner, Brockport, NY

"...It was a goldmine for me especially, removed as I am from the
academic world and from a community of serious poets."
LouAnn Muhm, Park Rapids, MN, Teacher, Creative Writing

"...extremely helpful to hear responses to the other manuscripts. I
learned as much or more from the critiques of others' manuscripts as I
did from the critique of mine."

Eating Chocolate Ice Cream: Reading Mayakovsky


Since I've decided to revolutionize my life

How early it is! It is eight o'clock in the morning.
Well, the pigeons were up earlier
Did you eat all your eggs?
Now we shall go for a long walk.
Now? There is too much winter.
I am going to admire the snow on your coat.
Time for hot soup, already?
You have worked for three solid hours.
I have written forty-eight, no forty-nine,
no fifty-one poems.
How many states are there?
I cannot remember what is uniting America.
It is then time for your nap.
What a lovely, pleasant dream I just had.
But I like waking up better.
I do admire reality like snow on my coat.
Would you take cream or lemon in your tea?
No sugar?
And no cigarettes.
Daytime is good, but evening is better.
I do like our evening discussions.
Yesterday we talked about Kant.
Today let's think about Hegel.
In another week we shall have reached Marx.
Goody.
Life is a joy if one has industrious hands.
Supper? Stew and well-cooked. Delicious.
Well, perhaps just one more glass of milk.
Nine o'clock! Bath time!
Soap and a clean rough towel.
Bedtime!
The Red Army is marching tonight.
They shall march through my dreams
in their new shiny leather boots,
their freshly laundered shirts.
All those ugly stains of caviar and champagne
and kisses
have been rubbed away.
They are going to the barracks.
They are answering hundreds of pink
and yellow and blue and white telephones.
How happy and contented and well-fed they look
lounging on their fur divans,
chanting "Russia how kind you are to us.
How kind you are to everybody.
We want to live forever."
Before I wake up they will throw away
their pistols, and magically
factories will spring up where once
there was rifle fire, a roulette factory,
where once a body fell from an open window.
Hurry dear dream
I am waiting for you
under the eiderdown.
And tomorrow will be more real, perhaps,
than yesterday.

*ARTS / ART & DESIGN *   | July 13, 2008
 * Art:  The Image Is Familiar; the Pitch Isn't
<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/arts/design/13fine.html?ex=1216872000&en=1b778806477a19e6&ei=5070&emc=eta1>
*
 By MIA FINEMAN
 Artists have appropriated images from advertising for decades. What happens
when the tables are turned?

Conceptually, the artist's appropriation of an already existing image is, in
theory at least, seen as "a critique of originality."

Yet when a corporation--or another artist--appropriates the "non-original"
art of appropriation--
the "death of the author" turns out to have been instead a playing at
possum,  playing possum, as the  "Non-original artist" wakes from her
slumber and claims the appropriated "non-original" work as being, in fact, a
work of originality that needs to be protected from the marauding of
"corporate raiders."

In a potentially endless series of art-advertising-art-advertising
appropriations and  re-appropriations begetting unto the indefinite,
open-ended generation repetitions of the same as a difference which becomes
another difference which is at the same time "apparently" the same--
what is produced, ironically, is undying desire for originality, to be
"original," and to have created the "original work," to have had "the
original  idea."

A Conceptual advertisement and promotion of "non-originality" when
confronted with advertising's use of one's advertisements of
"non-originality" reveals "the fear of death, of an anonymous, unmarked
grave" that "re-animates" the "dead author" of "non-originality" into a
desperate assertion of being, after all, both very alive and very original.

The "critique of the self" and of "originality," it turns out, are
acceptable conceptually, but not at the level of "property relations."

A Conceptual "non-self non-original  artist//writer" literally
"materializes" in the claim to a property which is "mine."  A property it
turns out, that  possesses  an "originality" "belonging to ME."

In Emerson's Nature, the poet sees "a property in the landscape which does
not belong to this or that farmer.  The "property" that the poet sees is not
an object or a concept-as-object which can be owned, like Robert Smithson's
Art of Looking, in which the artist''s glance creates works which are real
as any object, yet refuse to be locked into the prison of being a
"property," and object, which can be owned,
The "originality" of a poet, an artist, is an activity in time which cannot
be embodied in time, as in an object that can be owned.

The paradoxical situation of the non-original appropriating artist/writer
faced with the appropriation of her non-original object, discovers that
their conceptions and identity have become imprisoned in the object.  Having
dispensed with an "original self," the artist of appropriation is faced with
being an appropriated "non-original self," which is threatened with the
"death of the author" indeed when its "objectification" in the work is in
danger of being appropriated into an advertisement for products belonging to
someone else.

Instead of being an Artist/Poet of Looking who sees that property in the
landscape belonging to no one, , the "non-original" artist/writer has become
a property in the landscape which can be owned by anyone else, and so has to
fight to be recognized as in themselves being a property, and indeed, an
"original and living Artist, Poet, " with a claim to those objects which are
not so much simply "belonging to ME,""made by ME," but are in a sense
actually "Me," "Me" as a piece of property.

And paradoxically finding "Me" locked in a court case or media battle to
prove that after all, one DOES exist, that one does "posses" the "property
of originality" as a "being Me, an Original and Living Me,"
instead of simply an object which "doesn't belong to anyone" and so can be
claimed by anyone as their "personal property."

Thanks you guys for all of this.

i ended up using lots of stuff, baraka and dickens, dos passos too
although not so much time to digest it

hardest as always: the human moments just trying to get students to
get over their shyness (and prejudices but shyness too--the two go
together) why am i defending white suburbanites? well, i think they
need a lot of help. just think how horrifying that must be: the
suburbs. so i felt like i had to run around and personally introduce
everyone to everyone, quite the politician. connections about love,
about baseball stats. a little start in those human connections
amongst the two percent who cared. (there was another 4% who didn't
show up and some even arrived and looked around and walked off. plus
another frightened 80% who huddled somewhere nearby, too afraid to
not-attend, too affraid to participate, maybe next year). but how
grateful i was for that two percent who talked.

and art will have to come afterwards. sometimes that human connection.
(how could we have forgotten about this part of writing: about life
and later then art, technique and all that. ideally they come together
but real heart generalliy finds a way to real skill.)

oh sappiness.

David,

As you perceptive analysis shows, the underlying question is, "who owns a
work of art," more specifically a work of literature (but, in our world, one
can apply the same question to images). My view is "no one." I am completely
with Emerson here (and Thoreau and Spicer and Walter Benjamin). The
work/image belongs to a movement of language/images which consittutes our
thought/cultural/economic matrix (Emerson's landscape). If a corporation
wants to use one of my phrases, I would be pleased because it implies that
what I am doing as an individual -in Spicer's term, medium- has the ability
to open to a wider world. Spicer's claim, "No one listens to poetry" and
Benjamin's, "one writes for no one," are closed related to this. This
radical isolation is liberating; if no one listens or one writes to no one,
then no one owns what is written. The social contract of the author with the
world becomes of a peculiar sort: between the writer and cultural,
linguistic movements which are at the moment invisible, below the surface,
in a sense "unneeded," the way Cassandra's admonitions were "unneeded,"
therefore, unheard. Of course, all this does not prevent Spicer from hoping
to pick up boys through his poetry or Benjamin from hoping to get a
university position. That desire -a version of payment- has little to do
with how the writing occurs.

I think "the death of the author" is a more specific and quite different
concept. Initially, it applies to the lyric "I," asserting that this "I" has
little to do with personal feelings or biography; but the "I" becomes a
mark, a "moving zero," an elusive, transforming target, which registers the
linguistic motion I have been pointing to above. "The death of the author,"
in that sense, it transforms the lyric; *but It does not kill it* or make it
obsolete, as many suggested. Rather, it transforms it into a metaphysical
medium, a medium of motion rather than personal expression.

"The death of the author" is also at the heart of hypertext, which, as a
form, is the literal expression of the idea of non-ownership. But I think it
is different in a significant way from the process I described earlier. In
my view, it overlooks the radical isolation with which writing responding,
opening to "hidden" movements requires. In one sense, all writing
constitutes a hypertexts which other writers respond to, misread, alter,
expand, etc. That is what Benjamin's "ideal language" is. But hypetext, as a
conscious for of writing, assumes a present community. I am not sure if this
presence helps or inhibits the process; maybe it does both.

Ciao,

Murat

misery?  "The Stonewall Diversity Champions" has listed as its 400th member
the British Army for their open inclusion of gays and lesbians into the
armed forces.  WOW!  I'm not even sure how to react with anything but anger.

The fight to NOT BE OPPRESSED does not mean to be included into the
oppressor's world.  WHY WOULD the oppressor think they're SO GREAT that we
would even WANT to be them!?  I would want to BE like the person
who has kept me from my life?

It's more the problem of course of gays and lesbians who do not share my
view here, who DO think that the ULTIMATE GOAL should be to meld and
disappear into the machine with all of its sharp tools carving the world
into one grand, obedient, nameless, worker-consumer, killing all who defy.
The British Army is the 400th member of "The Stonewall Diversity Champions,"
I just need to WRITE THIS AGAIN, and SAY IT OUT LOUD AGAIN, because it's SO
HARD TO BELIEVE!

The worst thing is NOT being able to stop this kind of ABUSE to the lives we
lead, and how we want to lead, away from such brutality.  The committee for
this BOGUS award will represent who they want to represent.  GAYS IN THE
MILITARY IS NOT A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE!
http://tenbyfour.blogspot.com/2006/05/why-gays-in-military-is-not-civil.html

To honor the war machine through Stonewall is so infuriating I feel like I
blew a fuse.  I mean, I can't even FEEL angry, but I know I'm SO ANGRY, and
that's why I'm numb.

To honor war is to not honor the LOVE Marsha P. Johnson used to strike the
police with, her need to be left to her life, and to protect her family who
were other fringe, mistreated, neglected souls like herself.

I'm not even sure where I send my hate mail today.  England or New York?

Murat,
I just wanted to send my thanks for what you wrote below and to say that
"this radical isolation is liberating" is the truest
thing for me. There is such a sense of "difficulty" and "ambition" in the
writer who makes writing a "career"--the
writers who simply enjoy writing/ who do not buy into the illusion of the
artist's self-importance are a joy to know and to read. It is the process itself
as far as I'm concerned. Perhaps my life experience has taught me to examine
the idea of "audience" very closely--we speak to ourselves is my conclusion
and any "audience" does the same --and it is absurd for me to worry about
an audience--once we no longer have consciousness and self-consciousness
the world vanishes for us is my conclusion--our suffering comes from trying
to control and wanting to control beyond the grave sounds like serious
suffering to me as does all other ideas of artistic control as in
"audience"--anyway, I am moving off topic as per usual so I will end here with
Thanks,
Bobbi
P.S. I wrote a story about "audience" when I left the visual art world or at
least tried to--it is a true story--it is about how I boxed hundreds of drawings
and canvases and etchings and etching plates--I found it a ceremonial
way to say "good-bye" to my destroyed "art career" (partially self-induced)
-- I put my visual images downstairs for the garbagemen (garbage people?/
sanitational engineers? p.c. lurks everywhere) in New York--but hours
later I walked outside again only to find my work exhibited on the sidewalk
in front of my apartment bldg.--people taking the drawings/ paintings they
wanted. In this story I write about "audience" and how contracted are ideas
of fame and who is an audience to our work (such an artifical concept--ie;
these people wanted my work but the "setting" is what mattered according
to everyone /not the acutal appreciation
or whatever is exemplified when people rifle through the garbage of others
(in my case: years of accumulated pieces of art made by me)--
and the complex way work is presented...i could go on forever but will
stop here

"appropriation" of appropriation-originality--NY Times article

David,

As you perceptive analysis shows, the underlying question is, "who owns a
work of art," more specifically a work of literature (but, in our world, one
can apply the same question to images). My view is "no one." I am completely
with Emerson here (and Thoreau and Spicer and Walter Benjamin). The
work/image belongs to a movement of language/images which consittutes our
thought/cultural/economic matrix (Emerson's landscape). If a corporation
wants to use one of my phrases, I would be pleased because it implies that
what I am doing as an individual -in Spicer's term, medium- has the ability
to open to a wider world. Spicer's claim, "No one listens to poetry" and
Benjamin's, "one writes for no one," are closed related to this. This
radical isolation is liberating; if no one listens or one writes to no one,
then no one owns what is written. The social contract of the author with the
world becomes of a peculiar sort: between the writer and cultural,
linguistic movements which are at the moment invisible, below the surface,
in a sense "unneeded," the way Cassandra's admonitions were "unneeded,"
therefore, unheard. Of course, all this does not prevent Spicer from hoping
to pick up boys through his poetry or Benjamin from hoping to get a
university position. That desire -a version of payment- has little to do
with how the writing occurs.

I think "the death of the author" is a more specific and quite different
concept. Initially, it applies to the lyric "I," asserting that this "I" has
little to do with personal feelings or biography; but the "I" becomes a
mark, a "moving zero," an elusive, transforming target, which registers the
linguistic motion I have been pointing to above. "The death of the author,"
in that sense, it transforms the lyric; *but It does not kill it* or make it
obsolete
, as many suggested. Rather, it transforms it into a metaphysical
medium, a medium of motion rather than personal expression.

"The death of the author" is also at the heart of hypertext, which, as a
form, is the literal expression of the idea of non-ownership. But I think it
is different in a significant way from the process I described earlier. In
my view, it overlooks the radical isolation with which writing responding,
opening to "hidden" movements requires. In one sense, all writing
constitutes a hypertexts which other writers respond to, misread, alter,
expand, etc. That is what Benjamin's "ideal language" is. But hypetext, as a
conscious for of writing, assumes a present community. I am not sure if this
presence helps or inhibits the process; maybe it does both.

Ciao,

Murat

Thanks for the words of wisdom, Murat. In some ways you are very correct, a=
nd likeable, and thanks for reminding me about Benjamin and Spicer. But Eve=
rything Zen? I don't think so. Warhol made history by reinterpreting rubbis=
h-as-art. To flip that once more is to spin a coin two ways at once. Or, ma=
ybe this IS what makes the world go round... Everything Zen? I DO think so.=
 How many of us can avoid touching the Polo attire of a magnetic David? And=
 who could say No to any product being pushed by the enigmatic charm of a M=
ona Lisa? The distinction between art and artifact is already blurred, as w=
e perpetuate the myth of education among the masses... And So It Goes, as p=
er (not Vonnegut Jr., but) the copywriter facing a deadline on his ad campa=
ign for, say, halitosis relief.

Here's to the DNA on Ginsberg's tennies (and that he might wear them once m=
ore).

Yeats Meets the Digital Age=2C Full of Passionate Intensity







By JIM DWYER




A digital resurrection allows Yeats to stride again along the hinge of the =
19th and 20th centuries.

Mary Baker has a telephone in her vault in Cambridge 'MA's Mt Auburn Cemete=
ry--

the number was (and hopefully still is) in he phonebook--
she never answered in al the times I tried calling--

but with ever advancing Media as Mediums=2C one may soon find oneself with =
the ability to accompany Raymond Chandler "down these mean streets=2C"
or join Rimbaud for 'A Season in Hell"--

Attempts to lengthen one's stay among simulated "literary/artistic people=
=2C places & times"--

may have to be carefully controlled by guardians against new forms of "esca=
pism"--

and=2C perhaps=2C "border patrols" will have to be employed to contain all =
those from "other times" attempting to crash into the present as "illegal a=
liens"--

Hello, I'm new here. I don't know the local introduction behaviours, so I'll
just extend my hand and gabble.

I've been writing poetry since the 1960s, firstly under the influence of
Milton et al, but then influenced by the Beats and jazz liner notes, Zen
(Beat to Square), and folk songs. By the time I was 18 and leaving school, I
was ready to hit the road and escape my conservative surburban upbringing.
So I hitched from Perth to Sydney, west coast to east coast Australia - safe
back then, not so safe now.

At this time I was published in a university literary quarterly - a short
Saroyanesque story about a boy staring at ants, yet somehow the reader knows
he is damaged in some way. I've lost it, thankfully, because it remains
'beautiful' in my memory, and was probably more awkward on the page.  Much
of my teenage poetry has gone the same way. Yet that early publishing
encouragement set me on the path to being a lifelong writer.
But I go on too long ... This is a similar start to many. Let's just say I
have written a mess of poems over the last forty plus years, some of which
has appeared in print (many mags, six books) and some of which has appeared
disguised as plays, tiny films, stories and one novel.

After quarter of a century in advertising (my anti-intellectual years), I
changed careers and taught writing and literature at various universities,
including a recent stint at Shanxi Normal University in Linfen, China.
During these, my intellectual years, I received a PhD from Edith Cowan
University three years ago.

But my main interest is my next poem, and my curiosity has lead me to
investigate many poetics from around the world. On this list, I hope to gain
more insights and share some of my passion for poetry.

My day to day interests are well exposed on my blog (address below).

Thank you for reading.

Andrew

The Atlanta Poets Group is seeking proposals for work for the third issue o=
f its magazine Spaltung. =C2=A0This issue will be packaged in the form of a=
 box. =C2=A0We are looking for poem-objects. =C2=A0Pieces that address/embo=
dy the concept or experience of multiplicity/heterogeneity are encouraged. =
=C2=A0*Please do not send work at this time.* =C2=A0Instead please send a *=
proposal* for the piece you propose to include to: =C2=A0spaltung@comcast.n=
et. =C2=A0Deadline for proposal submissions is September 31. =C2=A0Some par=
ameters you should consider in preparing your proposal:

--100 units of the magazine issue will be produced.
--We have not yet decided on the size of the box; =C2=A0in cubic inches it =
will likely be larger than a breadbox and significantly smaller than a movi=
ng crate.
--If your piece(s) require anything beyond mindless, cheap reporduction/ass=
embly, we will likely look to you to provide us with 100 units, fully assem=
bled.
--We are mostly looking for work that is beyond what can be accomplished on=
 8.5 x 11 inch paper and beyond what can be included on a CD-ROM.
--Proposals should include exact dimensions of the object(s) to be submitte=
d.

HELLO FRIENDS!!!

I hope this note finds you all well in body and mind!
Logan Ryan Smith of Transmission Press was kind enough to publish a
collected edition of my Open Night Poems, love poems of the open night!

It's here, people! This is a book that rivals records and makes you

realize that it's not round-- but it sure does GROOVE, baby! Oh yeah!
You want you some poetry that makes yr heart sizzle all the way to yr
tongue, baby? Oh yeah, this is the book for you! You know how people
call certain bands "Music to Make-Out To"? Well, baby, sweet sunshine
of my life, this here is "POETRY TO MAKE-OUT TO". Yes, that's right,
this is the book that makes things go ba-bump in the night! It'll make
yr legs shake, yr liver quake, and yr brain bake, baby, oh yeah! So
come on now and get 'em like a sweet piece of hot cakes! Oh yeah! Take
this book to yr insomnia and call it FRIEND. It's the book that keeps

If you're going to be in Halifax on Tuesday, July 29, please come to my =
reading for the Shoestring Reading Series. I'm doing a week-long tour of =
Nova Scotia, including an archeological dig at Beaubassin, where some of =
my Acadian ancestors lived before making their way to Louisiana. My =
visit will culminate in the Halifax reading - thanks to David Rimmington =
for arranging it. I'm looking forward to seeing Nova Scotia and meeting =
some poets!

You can check out some of my poems, collage art, etc., at my website:

Camille Martin, a Toronto poet and collage artist, is the author of =
Codes of Public Sleep (BookThug, 2007) in addition to several earlier =
chapbooks. Recent work is published or forthcoming in The Literary =
Review of Canada, PRECIPICe, The Walrus, West Coast Line, This Magazine, =
White Wall Review, Rampike, W Magazine, and Chicago Review.  Recently =
she received a grant from the Ontario Arts Council to complete a book of =
sonnets. She earned an MFA in Poetry at the University of New Orleans =
and a Ph.D. in English at Louisiana State University. Currently she =
teaches writing and literature at Ryerson University.

=20

* * * * * * * * * *

Codes of Public Sleep breaks open the code of private thought to modes =
of knowing catastrophe that defy insufficient isolating sagas. Camille =
Martin's poetry is the shattering signal from a laudably wild tongue =
that will not keep still for our death-drive culture. This is a =
remarkable collection.   - Carla Harryman

i thought that was an interesting post, murat. i don't agree with lots of
it, but you get at some things that are important that not too many people
seem able to write about at all, even if you're wrong about them.

the interesting part, i felt, was the stuff on ownership. very writerly. not
so much anti-capitalist as yawning at capitalism in a poetry context. which
is right, i feel. capitalism in a poetry context is just more or less
irrelevant.

contrast that, however, with visual art. if you hang out with new york
visual artists online or anywhere else, you see just how little sense any
art makes to them that *doesn't* work within capitalism. galleries,
products, and so on. if it doesn't make it monetarily, it just doesn't
count. it can't survive. in the 'market of ideas' in which new york artists
are immersed.

which is too bad for new york art, it seems to me. but i guess it makes
sense there.

whereas the 'market of ideas' you allude to is less about a capitalistic
market as something different. which is important. and expensive, in a
sense.

the danger of poetry resides, in part, in its being able to operate, to some
extent (more than visual art) in other dimensions than the genuinely boring
capitalistic market of ideas.

genuinely boring. deeply. terminally. genuine stuff of the forces of
dullness. witness the art it promulgates in mass media, which is little more
than a provisional business proposition.

which is one of the reasons i remain optimistic about the internet. as
medium for something else.

Bobbie,

What happened to your art work reminds me of david Chirot's "RubEings." They
could have been picked by him and used in some form.

Ciao,

In case your summer has begun to fall into the gray, very flat tire mode - and you are stuck in Immobile without out a sunny beach on a clear lake or such (& any way it's currently rotten foggy cold in San Francisco), you may want to try out the last several weeks on John Latta's blog in which several mostly friendly, and smart combattants play 'button, button, who's got the button" in search of a genuine authentication of two of Frank O'Hara's poems. Go to:
 http://isola-di-rifiuti.blogspot.com/

 Otherwise, or, as well, if you are in this City, to warm, chill and variously charm your ears, eyes, brains & hearts, and, maybe, the whole body, this evening you are welcome to hear me and George Albon read from our works at Books & Bookshelves at 7:30, the corner of 14th & Sanchez, San Francisco.

(whew! what a relief...)

Court rules lesbians are not just from Lesbos

ATHENS (Reuters) - A Greek court has dismissed a request by residents
of the Aegean island of Lesbos to ban the use of the word lesbian to
describe gay women, according to a court ruling made public on Tuesday.

Three residents of Lesbos, the birthplace of the ancient Greek poetess
Sappho whose love poems inspired the term lesbian, brought a case last
month arguing the use of the term in reference to gay women insulted
their identity.

In a July 18 decision, the Athens court said the word did not define
the identity of the residents of the island, and so it could be
validly used by gay groups in Greece and abroad.

The ruling ordered the plaintiffs to pay court expenses of 230 euros
($366.2).

"This is a good decision for lesbians everywhere," Vassilis Chirdaris,
lawyer for the Gay and Lesbian Union of Greece, told Reuters. "A court
in Athens could not stop people around the world from using it. It was
ridiculous."

He said the plaintiffs were free to appeal the decision in a higher
court.

Lesbos, which lies just off the Turkish Coast, has become a gathering
spot for gay women from around the world, especially at the village of
Eressos which is regarded as the birthplace of the poet in the 7th
century B.C.

Several residents testified during the trial that the use of the word
lesbian had brought recognition to the island and boosted its tourist
trade.

  Dimitris Lambrou, proud Lesbian and leader of this inane court case, can just get in a long line of folks who have longed to rid the Isle of Lesbos of its pro-woman sentiment and history, mostly through efforts to "cleanse" Sappho’s verse, as noted here: http://www.glbtq.com/literature/sappho,5.html --

  Attempts to Heterosexualize Sappho

  Despite the strong evidence to the contrary, serious attempts have been made to heterosexualize Sappho. In antiquity, a legend was created that, in the end, Sappho renounced the love of women and fell in love with the ferryman Phaeon. Too ugly to get her man, she leapt off of the Leucadian Cliff to her death.

  This legend is so incongruous with the authorial voice in Sappho's verse that the ancient biographers themselves were confused: They list two Sapphos of Lesbos. The second Sappho is described as either a lyre-player or courtesan, but specifically not the poetess. It is this second Sappho who committed suicide for love of Phaeon.

  Ovid, in his Epistles, conflates the two Sapphos: It is the great poet Sappho who renounces girls and longs for Phaeon. It is this Sappho that writers, artists, and composers have focused on ever after.

  Sappho's Marriage as Proof of her Heterosexuality

  Some commentators cite as proof of Sappho's heterosexuality the fact that she was married and had a daughter. Curiously, her husband is cited as Kerkylas from Andros. The name Kerkylas is based on the word for "penis." Andros comes from the word for "men." If we translate, then, we find that the most famous lesbian of all was married to Penis of the city of Men.

  Too good to be true? In any event, it is likely that she was married, but this has no bearing on her sexual orientation. Greek society was very different from our own: Marriage was seen as a civic responsibility and familial obligation. It was not designed--nor expected--to fulfill one's erotic or romantic needs. For that, men looked elsewhere. And marriage did not interfere with their homosexual affairs.

  Marital relations were known as a ponos or "labor," ergon "work," or kamnos, "toil." In contrast, erotic affairs were called paidia or "play." Men were so unenthusiastic about participating in sexual intercourse with their wives that they had to be reminded.

  Plutarch in his life of Solon suggests that a man should make love to his wife three times a month in order to ease marital tensions. Foreplay was actively discouraged: Too much pleasure might give a woman power over her husband and, thus, undermine his authority.

  Clearly, women could not expect sexual fulfillment within marriage. But for a woman to remain unmarried in this society was unthinkable. According to Eva Cantarella in her book Pandora's Daughters, girls were betrothed as young as five years old and, by thirteen or fourteen, they were subjected to arranged marriages to men who were aged thirty or older.

  Before and after marriage, women were completely segregated in the internal part of the house to which men had no access. Women did not come into contact with men outside their immediate family except occasionally at public festivals and funerals.

  On Lesbos, aristocratic women like Sappho got an education, albeit a "female" one emphasizing music, singing, and dancing. But as Cantarella points out, at least this education helped form their individual personalities and offered them a means to express it.

  If we take Sappho as a model teacher, it would appear that an appreciation of sensual expression, including lesbian affairs, was part of a girl's education. When a girl moved from maiden to married woman (at about fourteen), her time for play was over. She would have only memories of what must have been the happiest time of her life. It is no wonder that she wept on graduation.

  Women were segregated with other women, and socialized and trained by them. What would be more natural than for romantic attractions and rivalries to occur among them, as occurred among their menfolk? Who is to say if Greek women had homosexual affairs of their own?

  Sappho does, but, unfortunately, she is our only direct source for love between women; as Cantarella states, "Unlike male homosexuality, female homosexuality was not an instrument for the training of citizens. It therefore by definition interested only women."

The Debate over Sappho's Sexual Identity

  In the face of her erotic poetry, it is hard to believe that scholars continue to argue that Sappho was not a lesbian in the modern sense of the word. From the first extant comments on Sappho's erotic relations with young women in the Hellenistic period to the present day, critics (predominantly male), appalled at the thought of women engaging in lesbian sexual activity, have tried to deny Sappho's homosexuality.

  Their attempts range from deliberately mistranslating words that indicate that the beloved is female to forcing a heterosexual context on poems depicting lesbian desire.

  For example, the famous Fragment 31 has been described as a marriage-song in which Sappho relates the girl's desirability for the groom's benefit. Her feelings in the poem continue to be hotly disputed. They have been described as anything ranging from jealousy, love, fear, wonder, and terror to an anxiety attack brought on by penis-envy.

  Had this poem been written by a man, there would be little dispute. Nor has there been in the many translations penned by men. Of course, the gender dynamics of the poem are significantly altered when it becomes a male voice describing his response to a woman. Such translations are an insidious (if unintentional) way of heterosexualizing Sappho.

  In the poem, Sappho watches a man's reaction to her beloved and marvels at his composure, so different from her own response. To anyone who has ever been a lover, the symptoms of infatuation are unmistakable:

      Fragment 31
           To me, he seems like a God, that man,
      Who can sit at ease in your presence
           Who can hear your melodic voice
      Strumming close in his ear,
           Your provocative laughter:

      Ample cause for cardiac arrest.
           You spied, I swallow all voice
           And my tongue lies crippled.
      A lyric fire sweeps my flesh
           And my eyes stare blindly.
      Rhombs crash close in my ear,
           A chilling sweat fingers my spine,
      Trembling invades my every part
           And I am greener than grass.
      To myself, I seem like a corpse, or near....

  There is a whole tradition of "defenders" of Sappho. David Robinson is typical: "Villainous stories arose about her and gathered vileness till they reached a climax in the licentious Latin of Ovid."

  The most famous of Sappho's "defenders" was the German Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff who in his classic Sappho und Simonides depicted Sappho as a chaste Hausfrau, a virtuous pillar of the community and moral instructor of young girls. As Page describes it, Wilamowitz "gave new and lasting dignity to the old theory that Sappho was a paragon of moral and social virtues and that her poetry was grossly misunderstood in antiquity."

  Wilamovitz explained Sappho's relationship with her charges by depicting her as a cult priestess in the service of an "honest" (that is, nonsexual) Aphrodite. As Page points out, there is absolutely no evidence for this theory. Nevertheless, much scholarly ink has been spilled trying to prove that despite her professed love of women, despite her poetic genius, Sappho was still a "good" woman.

Biographical Information Little is known about Sappho's life and the information that is available cannot be viewed as trustworthy because accounts of the poet's life have become thoroughly interwoven with legend and myth. The only standard, but unreliable, source of information about Sappho's life is the Suda, a Greek lexicon compiled about the end of the tenth century. It records that Sappho was a native of Lesbos, an island in Asia Minor, and that she was probably born in either Eresus or Mytilene. Her father's name is given as Scamandronymus, and her mother's as Cleis. Evidence also suggests that Sappho had three brothers, and that her family belonged to the upper class. She is believed to have married a wealthy man named Cercylas—they had a daughter named Cleis together. Sappho apparently spent the majority of her life in the city of Mytilene, and most of her time there was occupied in organizing and running a thiasos, or academy for unmarried young women. As was the
 custom of the age, wealthy families from Lesbos and neighboring states would send their daughters to live for a period of time in these informal institutions in order to be instructed in the proper social graces, as well as in composition, singing, and the recitation of poetry. Ancient commentary attests to the fact that Sappho's thiasos ranked as one of the best and most prestigious in that part of Greece, and as its dedicated teacher and spiritual leader, she enjoyed great renown. Some legends of Sappho's life indicate that she lived to old age, but several others contend that she fell hopelessly in love with a young boatman, Phaon, and, disappointed by their failed love affair, leaped to her death from a high cliff—a story made famous by the Roman poet Ovid in his Heroides, but one which has been largely discredited by scholars.

Dear Murat:

Many thanks for your reply in ongoing conversation--

i spent some days in writing in return--
i keep trying to write responses & they all begin to turn into essays or
parts of the "annals of the new extreme experimental poetry"--

i think that in light of the proliferations of torture, of prisons, of web
censorship's and controls, surveillance and altering daily of sites, along
with massive dissemination of disinformation, the question of "radical
isolation" is being reframed in a great number of new ways and at an ever
greater pace--
as well as the question of who has access to the Internet, to electricity,
to cables. to education,  in the first place--
these are questions i find too little addressed as yet, though an awreness
of them is growing probably by the minute--

these issues present new challenges & questions--related to the directions
societies are taking in all aspects of "freedoms of speech, the press"--and
ones on line have been having anincreasing effect on publishing in the prin=
t
worlds--

in the following I mention these as pieces which are directly related to
many of the issues being discussed--

I think that before ownership there is definition--
the boundary lines, the extents and depths, of an idea, a person, a place a=
n
event--have to be mapped and defined in order for them to be "owned," for
there to be the act of "naming and claiming"--

One of the components of mapping and defining in this sense is that is made
with reference to some authority--
as in writing that "one writes for no one," the authority of Benjamin was
invoked (by yourself), and that of Spicer for "no one listens to poetry."

Hypertext, rather than being "the death of the author" and lacking in
ownership, is simply a reinscription of the author "under another guise,"
and is owned very much indeed by a series of "utilities," corporations,
program designers and producers of soft ware, etc.  Without electricity
there is no hypertext at all, let alone a web, an Internet.  Electricity is
owned and controlled and is not available to all,  It can be  shut off and
on as an instrument of death and disease as in Gaza, or for non payment of
the bill,  ever more common right here in Milwaukee. Libraries, public
computers--all these are  diminishing in number and amount of time allowed
on line to the individual otherwise without access.  Electricity, the
Internet,  can also be be bombed out of existence as power grids, as in
Serbia and Iraq, or entirely severed, line line, cable by cable, as in
Rwanda, in preparation for the  Genocides.

Access to the web is controlled also, and is a control which is being given
new methods with which  to deny, to restrict and alter access in terms of
"profiles," "suspicious activities," "alien contacts," or simply having "a
suspicious looking name."

Daily on the web, there are linkages which vanish, removed for a wide
variety of reasons, or, being contacted, have been altered substantially by
hackers, as individuals or as members of groups dedicated to various
projects of "revisionism," "redacting," rewriting and remapping landscapes,
histories, peoples and events.

 Hypertext does involve authorship as well as ownership in that the linkage=
s
themselves that are selected to create the Hypertext evidence an "author" i=
n
charge of the programming which controls the selections of links, the means
by which they are connected, and the over all point which is made, which is
arrived at. And the idea that "one writes for no one" on the web has been
pretty much made impossible by the passage into law of al the formerly
illegal eavesdropping, let alone the addition of even more "freedoms" in th=
e
"freedom" to make "unfree" the web by corporations and governments, secret
agencies and the military.

There is a great difference between a "radical isolation" which is chosen,
and one which is enforced.
And beyond "radical isolation," there is something more radical yet--the
refusal by writers to write in writing, and the means by which writings may
exist in writing yet be read as non writing, and so become non writings for
non readers.

Another form of writing that creates its own readers by making them non
readers of a writing it has taken possession of, and made into a form of
"radically isolated" writing rapidly becoming a non read  non writing, , is
"Benjamin's Baudelaire."  This fictional figure for a great many readers in
the English speaking world, has come to replace the actual Baudelaire, whos=
e
writings become non writings for non readers who have turned their entire
reading in Baudelaire's regard to that of Benjamin's writings of Benjamin's
Baudelaire.

Surrounded by the heavy weight of documentations, of quotations, invested
with the authority of a philosopher/critic far more acceptable to many
readers than the actual Baudelaire and his actual poetry, "Benjamin's
Baudelaire is a "fictional" "philosophical" construct who becomes "more
real" than the ever dimmer receding "image" of the poet.

The "radical isolation" of "one who writes for no one," paradoxically makes
of Baudelaire this figure, while Benjamin becomes the one who readers turn
to for "Benjamin's Baudelaire," a figure far more acceptable and
"comprehensible" than Baudelaire as a person and poet.

Of course, Benjamin did not intend this--"Benjamin's Baudelaire" is the
creation of a great number of persons, who are at the same time in a sense
also also reinscribing Benjamin from one position to another in ways which
can be at variance with the writings and thought of Benjamin himself.

Jack Spicer, with After Lorca, writes a much different form of encounter
with the writing of an other poet.  "Benjamin's Baudelaire" indicates an
ownership of the figure that the philosopher/critic's readers/critics have
created, while "After Lorca" means that Spicer is finding ways to respond
with the poetry of Lorca, not only in terms of Baudelairean
"Correspondances"," but also as letters in a written "correspondence" with =
a
dead poet who is also for a summer a lover and a ghost.

 "After Lorca" is a way of writing "after effects," of the "ending of an
affair," and the ending of the correspondence.  These "after effects " of
the dead poet/departed lover create the introductory note to the book penne=
d
by Lorca.  Already in an "uncertain terrain," the reader is unmoored from
being able to ascertain "with certainty" where "After Lorca" "ends" and
Spicer begins--that is, are the poems "After Lorca," simply that, and in no
way at all "actual translations of actual poems?"

After Lorca is extended from this "realm of uncertainty" by the Yasusada
writings, in which the fictional Yasusada determines to write works "After
Spicer."  These works will, like After Lorca, contain the correspondences o=
f
Yasusada with Spicer, and inact "After" effects of Spicer's writings in
those of the fictional Japanese poet.  Where Spicer eschews the use of
"supporting documentation," the Yasusada poet is supplied with a bevy of
"scholarly and critical notes," as though to create a much smaller version
of those documentations and allusions which surround the figure of
"Benjamin's Baudelaire."

From "Benjamin's Baudelaire" to Spicer's After Lorca to Yasusada's After
Spicer, one moves through an ever expanding series of the "After effects" o=
f
"dead authors" (Baudelaire, Lorca, Spicer, Yasusada is "already dead"
himself at the "discovery and opening" of his texts, and learns of Spicer's
death right after having written to him the first time.)

Rather than a "death of the author," dead authors find themselves
experiencing the "posthumous existences," "After Lives," in their "After
effects" among the writings of others.
These reverbereations of Melville's "shock of recognition" that travels the
world round, create rippling effects that travel, like those from a stone
thrown in a pond--outwards from their continually shifting "centers,"
creating "spheres" not unlike that of Pascal's image of God:  a sphere whos=
e
center is everywhere and circumference nowhere. These rippling "After
effects" know no "bounds of sentient existence," and so do not experience
"death," but continually appear, disappear, reappear as ghosts, as fictions=
,
as "impersonations," and as actors playing their "part" in re-stagings of
the "drama of their lives and works."

One finds the presences of lost, forgotten, hidden, "dead" beings , events
and writings via an awareness of these "After effects" which are found all
around one, as Whitman found in the Leaves of Grass the tongues of the
"sleepers."

There are writers and writings which announce that they are giving voice to
those silenced within history.  A different way is to find among things in
the world those evidences of the actions expressed as "After effects," and
by working with them, begin to hear, read, write with these the emergence o=
f
the words of the "dead," the ghosts, the fictional ones.  Generated by the
"shock of recognition," the collaborations of "the living and the dead" fin=
d
among the unread non-writings "Correspondances" and correspondences creatin=
g
linkages in which it is neither one singly that speaks and writes, but this
Other.

(This is what the rubBEings i have been working with for almost a decade no=
w
are.  This found non writings hidden in plain site/sight/cite i have worked
with when confined in cramped and controlled "non interesting" places, whil=
e
homeless and sleeping among them, inside of every structure, and outside,
all around.  As "overlooked" "Unseen" non writings, one begins with working
with things which are themselves in a kind of "radical isolation" and in
turn, the things one makes with them--as far as one had any thought of it,
one doubted there would ever be an audience other than passersby and police
officers, property owners and viewers who expressed delight and moved on.
 To work in full view and be at the same time working in a sense with an
"unknown non art form" --known when known at all as an ancient method of
copying, indeed  the very first "copier machine!"--one realizes often that
"who an audience might be" is "unthinkable" in a sense, as what one is
finding is more than likely not of any interest to anyone, except to onesel=
f
and these collaborators one is working with.  One is working with--the
excitement of finding--as where it is going, one has no idea other than
places of "an outside," where there is a sense of freedom in being in an
area without any DEFINITIONS.)

There's a paradox at the heart of quoting well known writers to the effect
that "one writes for no one," and that  "no one listens to poetry," in that
these words are in fact "speaking to a great many, and especially oneself."
The words in turn are a sign that one is not writing for "no one," but
rather for that as yet "unknown reader."  "No one" can in effect also mean
"no particular one," which is to say "many" rather than simply a "one" as a
specific and limited "one."

Taking these words to heart as a writer means one is using as examples
persons who, though writing for no one or saying that no one listens to
poetry, are themselves the proof of the contrary.  This enables one to
believe that though one is writing for no one and/or no one listens to
poetry, there will be persons for whom one writes, and ones who do listen t=
o
poetry.

For are not these writers quoted the very proof of this?
And, quoting them, does not one lay bare one's belief in this same thing
being possible for one's self and one's writings?  That is, by virtue of
these examples, one takes hope--

The very setting of words to a surface--rock, paper, wood, glass, plastic,
anything in short including sands which are washed away--indicates a writin=
g
for some one to at some point find it.

After all, person who really did write for no one--would have left no quote=
s
to this effect behind them.  There would be no writing at all there to find=
.

Of course, there exist incredible tonnages of unread writings and unheard
poetries in the world, whose unreadabilities and unheard poetries are so
because they do not fit into the defined boundaries and tastes of what is
readable, what is poetry.  Some are those in the long parades of writings
and poetries discovered only later on,, when the definitions are more
welcoming to them, or, are poetries and writings once considered fabulously
readable and poetic which have fallen out of fashion or interest and so
taken up residence among the archives of the forgotten.

There are also a great many writings existing at al times which are unread
or considered non poetries, not listened to, which are so because of the
readers and readings who may on the one hand have yet to learn how to read
them, or, on the other hand, because the writings and poetries do not want
to be read or heard yet to walk among the non readers and no listeners as a
sign of refusal of them in their state of non reading and non listening.

And yet again, are those writings and poetries which are never committed to
writing in the first place, and among which may be some of the greatest
works ever created, yet, having been created by those forbidden through
thousands of years from learning to read or write, they have existed only i=
n
the minds of their creators, and perhaps, here and there, as spoken to
others who have gone on to forget them, or recalled but small bits and
pieces.

There are also writers like one in a series of stories I am writing and
others in essays which are interested in this, which participate in the
refusal of writing so that it does not fall into the hands of others.  Or
simply as a refusal of writing, while al the while writing elsewhere--in th=
e
mind or in other forms which are not recognized as writing.

In an essay written for the recent Symposium conceptual Poetry and its
Others, one of the figures noted in this regard is that of Bartleby the
Scrivener whose job it is to be a copy clerk yet faced with his task, "woul=
d
prefer not to" write down a single mark.  This conception of writing has
interested me for along time, hence the thinking of the untold number of
writings through history written by humans which were never in writing due
to all manner of reasons preventing them from knowing how to write at all,
as well as all sorts of writings by writers who were not allowed to write,
leading to another group, those writers ho write a writing which is meant t=
o
be unread, even when a person is actually reading it.

These ideas lead one to to strange areas where the fictional and the factua=
l
exist alongside each other as a paradoxical writing re unwritings and
nonwritings and unread and unreadable writings.  Moving along in these
areas, one's hope is to find others who are interested in these questions.
I had read in an Introduction to a book by Cesar Aira written by Roberto
Bolano of an author named Enrique Vila-Matas.

Ever on the lookout for something by this author besides what found on line=
,
one day I came across an old issue of Grand street in a dollar bin, and in
it were excerpts from Bolano's Distant Star, a great favorite of mine, and
one from a book by Vila-Matas--which turned out to be from Bartleby and
Company--taking Bartleby as I had done as a figure of a writer who does not
write, who refuses to write. .  In this way a fictional non writing writer
leads one to a writer ho shares the same interests and starting point for
similar meditations, and who also mixes the fictional with the factual in
the  study of writing to do with the unwritten --and the unreadable--as a
form of writing.

If one writes with a sense that known and even very well known writers have
written that they write for no one, and of  poets who write that no one
listens to poetry, then one is beginning really from the premise that one
actually is writing for someone, somewhere, sometime.

 That hope which is thrown out into the oceans as the "message in a bottle"
is implied in the very act of the writing which entertains this premise.  I=
n
this sense, one is working with writing which is recognized at the start as
being one which has enough in it of what is recognized as writing to be
found, possibly, someday, as indeed writing that is readable and so becomes
classified among the world's writings.

In a sense then, one is still imprisoned in objects which can be recognized
by the definitions of writing that are acceptable, or, being close enough t=
o
these, will at some point hopefully be so.

Rather than being "a writing for no one" written in "radical isolation," it
is a writing which is written within a writing that one acknowledges being
part of,and so hopes that with the passage of time, maybe very short, maybe
a bit longer, being carried in the flows of this writing, its 'message in a
bottle" will be found, and found to be acceptable and easily read.


"Acceptance," to have one's writing be "accepted,"  even if one was thinkin=
g
that one was writing for "no one," is this not a paradox which the question
of unwritten writings begins to open?  What begins to take place once one
thinks not of acceptance, but of refusal, to consider unwritten writings as
a refusal to write at al, or, if forced to write, to write in such a way
that it is a refusal of readability according to the definitions of those
who are forcing one to write?

A Russian artist notes that "Language is a fascism not because it silences,
but because it forces one to speak."

The rejection of silence and forcing of speech--is the function of
torture.   Even though it has long been well known that torture rarely
forces a speaking which "tells the truth," torture remains very much in
use.  So what is the purpose then?  As the earliest of torturers could tell
the current ones, it is not what the speaker is forced to speak, it is
simply that the speaker is forced to speak that accomplishes the mission of
torture.

Where once one might speak of a "tortured prose," there is now the
availability of "torture's prose or poetry."  The latter is considered a
form of "false speech" or writing as it is produced under duress, is
forced--even if truly confessional, unlike "confessional poetry," it is
denied the possibility of being a truth which is a readily given one, and s=
o
distanced from a "Truth value."  Yet, being unreadable in such terms, hence
being a kind of non-writing, may there not be even here a non written
writing which is going on that is being created, not as a code to elude the
conceptions of readability of the torturers, of which they are continually
in fear, but of a non writing of a different kind, a non writing in writing
which is a refusal of readability, a non writing which is a writing outside
of codes which can always be suppressed or deciphered?

Forced to write, how then does writing refuse to be "in" the  writing that
results, and at the same time refuse to be in codes which may be readable b=
y
someone?

In a time in which the Internet and all communications are transparent,
spied on, listened to and read, and in which prisons fill with unprecedente=
d
numbers of people and of unprecedented size are proliferating--(with Americ=
a
leading the way in numbers and percentage of population in the prisons
system, and Gaza leading in size and numbers of a single prison)--and in
which the uses of torture, disinformation, faked footage, planted evidences
and tampered witnesses expands daily--an examination of these  writings of
refusal, these refusals of writing in terms defined by the Security and
Police forces of the cultures of varying societies, is needed.

In a world in which writing is continually "under observation" and more and
more forms of language turn into doublespeak--the need to find other ways o=
f
writing and reading the simplest words and phrases opens--while around it s=
o
much else is closing and being closed off.

Jim:

I agree with all you say here.

Another problem with the contemporary visual arts is that the artists are
usually trained in a university art department that are tilted toward
training future professors. These departments graduate would-be artists out
of whom taking risks has been conditioned. Some have even taken courses in
business. Even the talented ones are not taught how to live their lives
creatively, which is what's most important. So that, eventually, their work
dries into the usual market decoration. Possibly, then, artists who attend
college should minor in art, and major in philosophy, comparative religion,
psychology, poetry, anthropology, et al.

Poets don't fair any better. What could be a plus: they cannot look forward
to living on the proceeds of their work, is usually a minus, as they see
little options but to teach, apply for the usual grants, and write the poems
that are expected of them. A friend of mine talks about the virtue of being
an "intellectual janitor." But, especially with an expensive degree in hand,
who has the dedication to their art to walk such a noble path?

Unlike the art market, and the publishing market, the slice of the internet
where artists function is, so far, non-judgmental. The problem is who one
brings to it.

BookThug is a Canadian independent literary publishing house that grew =20
up with Apollinaire?s Bookshoppe, an online bookshoppe that =20
specializes in the books that no one wants to buy. BookThug chooses to =20
publish no particular stream of poetry or literary content; rather the =20
goal is to loosely follow Eliot?s credo that there are only two kinds =20
of poetry: Good and Bad. BookThug could be said to represent either =20
depending on your point of view. BookThug resists being hegemonic =20
about borders, including those between languages, between genders, =20
between countries, and between genres. Above all, it seeks to promote =20
aMUSEment to the citizens of BookThug Nation through the publication =20
of unexpected literature. BookThug is as BookThug does.

http://www.myspace.com/apostleofhustle
http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/Apostle-Of-Hustle/6700162382

It?s a long Hitchcockian zoom-in, the omniscient clouds part, the =20
sleazy waterfront scene is set. Like Steve Zissou?s Belafonte =20
cross-section, we can see a number of little hives of activity: a =20
young man loiters behind a cramped bar; faces light by low lights, =20
listens intently while one speaks, gesturing wildly; a captain barks =20
orders at his crew to hurry the fuck up; someone throws flowers into =20
the sea; a vintage jukebox amuses the hipsters on a crawl. Welcome to =20
the borough of a possible nowhere.

Apostle of Hustle first took shape after a two-month sojourn in El =20
Barrio Santo Suarez, in Havana, in 2001. This experience was mind =20
blowing for Apostle of Hustle?s lead (Andrew Whiteman) from the ground =20
up: the community, the fashion, the speed, and the music. Whiteman =20
returned to Toronto invigorated about a possible music that did not =20
yet exist. Knowing he wanted to create it, Whiteman took up residency =20
at a local dive as Apostle Of Hustle, a quartet. The band played =20
Brazilian and Cuban folk songs, as well as Tom Waits, PJ Harvey, and =20
Marc Ribot covers. Whiteman played guitar and tres; plus he recruited =20
Dean Stone on drums and Julian Brown, an old buddy from the mid-?90s =20
indie scene, on upright bass. The fourth position was a kind of ?open =20
door? to whomever might show up on their nights, anyone from Bryden =20
Baird (Feist) on flugel horn to Daniel Stone (cache) on percussion.

Apostle of Hustle?s first endeavor, Folkloric Feel, was released in =20
July of 2004. It was a Frankenstein of a record, recorded in over four =20
different locations at different times. By this point, Whiteman was =20
almost completely consumed with recording and touring with Broken =20
Social Scene and finishing the Apostle of Hustle record could only =20
happen in between tours. A collection of tracks and mixes and ideas =20
was brought to BSS producer David Newfeld?s door and he somehow was =20
able to create the psychedelic debut that came out on the Arts & =20
Crafts label.

National Anthem of Nowhere was recorded in Montreal at Studio =20
Masterkut in March of 2006. This time around the band sought the =20
production talents of Martin Davis Kinack (BSS/Sam Roberts =20
front-of-house man, as well as Sarah Harmer producer). National Anthem =20
of Nowhere was finished in Whiteman?s bedroom in September and mixed =20
in the woods at Marty's secret studio locale. The vibe was almost =20
completely vin rouge, even after the Montreal stint. A few guests =20
lurked?Liam O?Neil from the Stills, Evan Cranley and Chris Seligman =20
from Stars, and Lisa Lobsinger who sang with BSS on their 2006 tours. =20
Daniel Stone is present on almost all the tracks playing conga, bongo, =20
and especially caja. The record sounds so good, he even decided to =20
skip part of the salsa season to tour with Apostle of Hustle in 2007. =20
Nice one, compa=F1ero.

written with Stephen Cain. His most recent publication, Lack Lyrics, =20

Jim,

While writing my original post, I thought of making it only about poetry,
being completely aware of what you are saying about the world of painting,
particularly in New York, which has been the center of the art market for
years. I decided against it because what I am saying applies to art in
general, representing one end of a spectrum. One can see this tension most
clearly in film, even the most stripped down version of which requires a
significant capital investment. The issue of means of production (studio,
independent, video, etc.) is an integral part of discussing an art of film.
What is peculiar about poetry is that it both requires very little capital
investment and it has almost as small audience. The investment poetry
requires is the poet's time (poetry is an art which consumes time; time is
at the heart of it). This makes the poet his or her audience. This condition
so clear in poetry exists in all arts, only blurred by the exigencies of
money in other arts. I wrote about this in my essay, "Is Poetry a Job, Is a
Poem a Product?"

Jim, you do not mention where you disagree with me. I would like to know.

Ciao,

Murat


Jim

Jim, having been in both worlds, I disagree with you. The poetry world may not run on money but it runs on ego--and only ego and ego to me is more dangerous
than capitalism in terms of art--and the art world in New York, where yes,
one can actually make some (little bit of) money is really a more open world,
at least as I experienced it. There are so many factions and enmities in the
poetry world--but there was a lot of support between visual artists I felt and I
actually felt part of that had to do with the fact of making some small amt.
of money from our work--but then I am also familiar with dealings with
"Hollywood" and of course Hollywood is the epitomy of corruption but
the fact that money is an obvious part of it makes it less corrupt in the sense
that it is all on the table and everyone knows and nothing is hidden.
I just find that ego is the enemy more than capitalism.--bobbi

i thought that was an interesting post, murat. i don't agree with lots of
it, but you get at some things that are important that not too many people
seem able to write about at all, even if you're wrong about them.

the interesting part, i felt, was the stuff on ownership. very writerly. not
so much anti-capitalist as yawning at capitalism in a poetry context. which
is right, i feel. capitalism in a poetry context is just more or less
irrelevant.

contrast that, however, with visual art. if you hang out with new york
visual artists online or anywhere else, you see just how little sense any
art makes to them that *doesn't* work within capitalism. galleries,
products, and so on. if it doesn't make it monetarily, it just doesn't
count. it can't survive. in the 'market of ideas' in which new york artists
are immersed.

which is too bad for new york art, it seems to me. but i guess it makes
sense there.

whereas the 'market of ideas' you allude to is less about a capitalistic
market as something different. which is important. and expensive, in a
sense.

the danger of poetry resides, in part, in its being able to operate, to some
extent (more than visual art) in other dimensions than the genuinely boring
capitalistic market of ideas.

genuinely boring. deeply. terminally. genuine stuff of the forces of
dullness. witness the art it promulgates in mass media, which is little more
than a provisional business proposition.

which is one of the reasons i remain optimistic about the internet. as

Murat, no my story is nothing like David Chirot's work with found objects--these
were finished art works that could have hung in a gallery and, under the right
lighting and with the right reviewers, might have been deemed whatever--I am
writing of context only--my attempt was to destroy these works. They were not
found objects but finished "art objects" taken out of the context which would
have "legitimized" them according to the "art world"-- No one made art work
out of these (I doubt--they were already finished pieces)--I have no idea
what was done with them but they were being picked up and taken by a lot
of people when I had wrapped them like caskets wanting them to be dumped and
buried--and "context is everything" in the art world--because while a
visual artist will say they want their work seen and owned and appreciated by
others the truth is visual artists want their work seen within the gallery
system with a review attached and then seen and owned and appreciated etc. If
my desire was "pure" (as in David's work) I would have been happy to see people
taking my work but I wanted "control" as in "the control to destroy" that which
I had no intention of trying to "sell" within the gallery system. David Chirot
is making art from what he finds I believe but I doubt (I'd have to ask David)
if David would use finished art pieces thrown away by an artist tired of her
images. my intention was just to say "it is all seen according
to context" and that, for me, is the artificiality of it--thank you, Murat--Bobbi

Bobbie,

What happened to your art work reminds me of david Chirot's "RubEings." They
could have been picked by him and used in some form.

Dear List,

SATELLITE TELEPHONE is a little magazine of poetry and fictocriticism,
handmade and small-run in the tradition of mimeos and fanzines.  Issue
#2 is out now and features new writing from:

CLAIRE BECKER, LYNN BEHRENDT, ROBERT DEWHURST, FANNY HOWE, KEVIN
KILLIAN, RODNEY KOENEKE, CHRIS KRAUS, DOROTHEA LASKY, SAM LOHMANN,

HANNAH SAYLE, KYLE SCHLESINGER, FRANK SHERLOCK, and SUSIE TIMMONS.

My friend the artist GOODY-B. WISEMAN drew a wonderful cover.  Xeroxed
and staple-bound, silkscreened covers.  $7 postage paid.

Will trade for mail art or other zines.

Sincerely,
Robert Dewhurst

CAConrad, thanks for the manifesto. I'm hoping that by now you realize that=
 Gays in the Military is-- if not a Civil Rights Issue-- a Human Rights Iss=
ue. Think about it. If someone really wants to get maimed or die or fall in=
to a trauma-induced psychosis while (ostensibly) defending our country, the=
n why stop them?=20

Armies of yesteryear denied females the glory of battle and the chance to e=
xperience serving in a military hierarchy; obnoxiously bisexual or homosexu=
al men were simply shot under the guise friendly fire. Lately it's been the=
 overt and sexually active guys who receive the discharge, and the flaming =
queens who get denied initial entry. It's only fair that everyone has the r=
ight to enlist or be drafted into an army, worldwide.=20

The objective of Ms. Johnson and other "gay" activists, it seems to me, is =
to equalize, not moralize over, any and every life path available, so that =
all of us get the feeling that we share the same slew of options and opport=
unities. To rage against new laws that permit a person to live a life from =
the classic vantage point of Soldier is, um, outrageous. But thanks much fo=
r the newsbrief, and sharing your thoughts.=20

Dear Friends of Tinfish Press:

I am writing to ask for your support for several upcoming projects by
Tinfish Press. I'd like to describe them to you so that you'll feel
enthusiastic about supporting our publications of experimental poetry
from the Pacific region. All gifts are tax deductible. Please open the
two attachments, which display designs for two of our new projects.

Already this year, we've published two full-length books, Meg Withers's
A Communion of Saints, a prose poetic elegy for men who died of AIDS in
1980s Honolulu, and Hazel Smith's The Erotics of Geography (with cd-r),
a selection of that British-Australian poet's page and performance
poems. We printed a new corrected edition of Lisa Kanae's important
work, Sista Tongue, which is widely taught in universities and schools
here and on the mainland. We are in the process of having Barbara Jane
Reyes's book, Poeta en San Francisco, reprinted. This book won a James
Laughlin award and has been near the top of the SPD best-seller lists
for a couple of years now. The New York Times indie list this past
Sunday showed the book at #2. Even my dean noticed! Many of our
publications have been taught at the university and high school levels;
please consider “adopting” our books for your courses, if you teach.

We will publish four more Tinfish products this summer and fall. Tinfish
18 features long poems by poets such as Mani Rao, Lyn Xu, Alysha Wood,
Norman Fischer, and Endi Hartigan. Tinfish 18 ½ will be a perfect bound
book of word games and poems designed by our Art Director, Gaye Chan,
curated by MFA student Lian Litvin, and featuring work by recent stellar
M.A. graduates of the UH English department and students in the art
department, as well as more established artists. This book will be fun
and interactive. Craig Santos Perez's full-length volume, from
unincorporated poetry, engages colonial histories, family, and
language(s); it's a marvelous first book for him, and fits our mission
to a T. Finally, we are working on a chapbook by Norman Fischer, zen
priest and poet.

With all of these projects coming together at once, our coffers are
emptying quickly. Please give through our website (www.tinfishpress.com)
or send a check to the above address. We will acknowledge you on our
website, if you give us permission to do so. Tinfish Press is a
non-profit organization, so your gifts will be tax-deductible.

Aloha,



Susan M. Schultz
Editor, Tinfish Press

for those in LA, I am gallery sitting the portion of the LA Art Girls
show at Phantom Galleries at the corner of 6th and Main (PE Lofts)
Friday 12-3 and Sunday 12-6; I would love to discuss this set of
issues within this context

my works are largely unsalable, as "reading" them makes a poem (in the
case of my work in the show); I find my fellow MFAs -- but in studio
art -- better prepared to live an art-focussed life, including
curating & studio visits & critical theory / historical background,
than I was by my MFA.  Unsalability makes gallery owners, who show to
earn commission, really confused about my things -- and, frankly,
there's a show on current tv that would normally be perfect for me/my
stuff, but it is for cheap objects, not free interactive objects

there's some popular recognition of LA as where international art gets made...

All best,
Catherine Daly

 James, I guess if queers want to join the KKK they should be allowed?

We are a country at war, let us NOT forget.  OVER A MILLION DEAD AND
COUNTING.

The military machine is NOT something I will ever get behind, ever!  Because
of who WE ARE, and who the British are (they helped us invade Iraq), there
is NO WAY to negotiate being in favor of gays in the military without ALSO
being in favor of the military.

a queer man who joined the military after 911.  He was outraged by what had
happened, of course, as we all were.  BUT, where does he wind up when they
ship his DUMB gay ass out?  IRAQ!  And he NEVER, not once does he EVER
QUESTION why he is in Iraq.  His ENTIRE purpose (according to his own
opening statement) was to go after the people who were responsible for 911.
THEN OF COURSE he's discovered as being QUEER and sent home, which was the
purpose of interviewing him.  We were supposed to FEEL TERRIBLE for him.
Boo hoo, poor guy, he doesn't get to carry a machine gun and prove he's a
REAL man!

Getting to put a rainbow sticker on a machine gun is what this is all
about.  GAY PRIDE IN KILLING!?

YES THIS IS TIME TO TAKE A STAND!  How many people have you known who HOLD
THE GERMAN CITIZENS responsible for Nazi atrocities?  We are already as
complicit in the eyes of the world.

The original people who risked their lives at the Stonewall riots were ALSO
VEHEMENTLY opposed to the war in Vietnam.  Marsha P. Johnson is someone I
met in person, and I can tell you right now that she was NOT SOMEONE who
would be in favor of giving the LOVE up to the British Army!

Gays in the military is NOT a civil rights issue!  THERE'S NOTHING CIVIL
ABOUT INVADING, KILLING, TERRORIZING, MAIMING, MAKING ORPHANS, ETC., ETC.,
ETC.!

YES IT IS TIME TO TAKE A STAND AND SPEAK UP, REGARDLESS OF HOW IT MAY SOUND!

QUEERS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED IN THE ARMED SERVICES BECAUSE OUR ARMED
SERVICES HAVE PROVEN TO BE DANGEROUS, AND RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR CRIMES!

We're supposed to be GRATEFUL that the British Army has "accepted" queers?
Well I DON'T ACCEPT THE BRITISH ARMY!  FUCK THE BRITISH ARMY!

NO QUEERS ALLOWED!  Anyone, and I mean ANYONE we can prevent from joining an
army like our army and the British army should be prevented!  NO FAGS OR
DYKES ALLOWED IN UNIFORM!  KICK THEM ALL OUT!  SEND THEM HOME!

I agree that capitalism is largely irrelevant to poetry.=A0 I think about t=
his a bit as a new full-length book of mine, Brainlifts, has just been publ=
ished by a relatively new small press called Straw Gate Books.=A0 I'm glad =
to say that the pressures of capitalism have little or nothing to do with h=
ow this book was produced or how it will fare.=A0 As for capitalism in the =
art world, I mostly agree.=A0 There is however a small part of the Chelsea =
art scene that is less influenced by the pressures of capitalism than the r=
est of it.=A0 I refer to the co-op galleries where I work sometimes.=A0 The=
y are membership galleries but they show many invited artists in one format=
 or another.=A0 Also, the quality of the work in these galleries has improv=
ed lately.=A0 Of course they are a small portion of an otherwise capitalist=
ic and greed driven plateau of art in NYC.=A0 But I just thought I should m=
ention that these other places still exist and have existed for a long
 time.=A0 Regards, Tom Savage

Jim,

While writing my original post, I thought of making it only about poetry,
being completely aware of what you are saying about the world of painting,
particularly in New York, which has been the center of the art market for
years. I decided against it because what I am saying applies to art in
general, representing one end of a spectrum. One can see this tension most
clearly in film, even the most stripped down version of which requires a
significant capital investment. The issue of means of production (studio,
independent, video, etc.) is an integral part of discussing an art of film.
What is peculiar about poetry is that it both requires very little capital
investment and it has almost as small audience. The investment poetry
requires is the poet's time (poetry is an art which consumes time; time is
at the heart of it). This makes the poet his or her audience. This conditio=
n
so clear in poetry exists in all arts, only blurred by the exigencies of
money in other arts. I wrote about this in my essay, "Is Poetry a Job, Is
a
Poem a Product?"

Jim, you do not mention where you disagree with me. I would like to know.

 Barack Obama's Poem Now a Videofrom Margery Snyder and Bob Holman's About
Poetry blog:

Wednesday July 23, 2008
Last March, we posted about two poems the youthful Barack Obama published i=
n
the Occidental College literary magazine in 1981:

   - The Intersection of Politics and Autobiography in
Poetry<http://poetry.about.com/b/2007/03/28/the-intersection-of-politics-an=
d-autobiography-in-poetry.htm>

The poems are "Pop," a portrait of his maternal grandfather, and
"Underground," a naturalistic description of "apes / That eat figs" in
subterranean water grottoes. A couple of months after the two poems came to
light, *The New Yorker* asked prominent critic and professor Harold Bloom
his opinion of them:

   - Harold Bloom comments on Barack Obama's
poems<http://poetry.about.com/b/2007/06/25/harold-bloom-comments-on-barack-=
obamas-poems.htm>

Bloom pronounced "Underground" the better of the two poems: "It gave me the
oddest feeling that he might have been reading the poems of D. H.
Lawrence=97it reminded me of the poem 'Snake'.... I think it is about some
sense of chthonic forces, just as Lawrence frequently is=97some sense, not
wholly articulated, of something below, trying to break through." Now the
Blue Rose Arts Collective has transformed "Underground" into a poetry video
on YouTube <http://youtube.com/watch?v=3DLRBl4QJC9GU>, combining footage of
Japanese snow monkeys with Indonesian music by the Nyoman Jayus Bamboo
Ensemble. I wonder what Obama thinks of their treatment of his poem. What d=
o
*you* think of it, as a poem and as a film? Come back after you've looked a=
t
the video and post your comments below.

*
*
The Iraq War, ignited by the use of the forged "Italian Letter" and the
Internet-found "secret information and images" provided by Curveball, which
were "proved" by being on the Internet, in terms of writing, becomes like
Fellini's saying of his Satyricon  that "it is a science-fiction film set i=
n
the past."  Iraq, site of the first known writing, is also home to the firs=
t
known forgeries, undertaken to "prove" the "historical" precedence of one
ruler over others.
       A  War based on forgeries and "plagiarisms" destroys, loots and
erases the site of precedence of writing and forgeries, in order to "forge"
its own Imperialist Textual Domination.  The writing and rewriting of
"histories" becomes an ever more unwieldy heap of palimpsests, in which the
voids and chasms of erasure are always yielding fragments that still remain
as evidences of once Dominant languages and writings.  To "fill in the gaps=
"
of these blank spaces, written over by more "dominant" and "bold" scripts,
hypotheses invite not only "actual remains," but a horde of forgeries as
well, each laying claim to some "link with the past," and many of them
claiming also "ownership" or residence in these near buried nooks and
crannies littering  the refuse and ruin strewn landscapes and lacerated
hulks of looted libraries and archives.

 Fictions, hypotheses, theories, speculations, forgeries, clog the arteries
of a "traffic in relics and information."  The "documentary history" of the
world, its peoples and cultures, opens into dizzying labyrinthine descents
into the depths of what become "newly discovered caches" and "revelations o=
f
forgeries," further mystified by the choosing of which such "evidences" are
used in simulations of "the cultural past."  Science-fiction does indeed
invade the "sands of time" flowing in the deserts below which flows oil and
ancient cuneiform writings.
           The massive "reconstruction projects" which are handed out
without open bids to favored corporations become involved in the selection
of what will be "reconstructed," what will be "never completed, promised
projects," and what are in the end the erection of tall and mighty
fortifications, ever larger and ever more "secure."
            One of the "amazing" things about these new fortifications is
that for al their immensity, many of them are evidences of new forms of
disappearances, as visions of those "mirages" that deserts are famous for.
Solid Walls take on the effects of invisibility, become the palimpsests
of"erased and written over" absented layers of texts in the "reconstruction=
s
of Ancient Texts" of the dominant histories and cultures.
            In the midst of a an apparent "flood" of faked memoirs, what
could be more "refreshing" than the appearance of purportedly truthful
memoir about the creation of faked literary celebrities' autographs?  The
faked memoir cause a "directed, controlled in many ways) "outrage" which fa=
r
exceeds that towards the outright forging of reasons for War.  The dangerou=
s
idea that fiction is awash in every "truthful account" of a person's life
needs to be allayed by a "truthful account" of the forging of author's
signatures.
         Ironically, the "truth" regarding forgeries is considered far less
"horrifying" than their appearnces as fictions taken to be truths.
         Perhaps this is why the forging of history is often presented as a
noble endeavor, undertaken as a "low means to a high end."  After all, as D=
r
Goebbels, Propaganda Minister of the Third Reich pointed out, repeat a lie
enough times and it becomes truth.  Historical documents that are forged,
used long enough, become indeed the "originary documents of Empire."
             Senator Obama's two college poems are being given the
"originary documents" treatment by none other than a leading literary and
Biblical critic, Dr Harold Bloom.  The "weight and stamp of Authority" is
given to these documents in such a way as to turn them into a form of "palm
reading," in whose lines may be glimsped signs of the promise, brightness
and "Hope" of the Future.
               The creation of the Candidate for President as a new kind of
"Poet Philosopher Warrior" prepared to extend and intensify the "Right War"
in Afghanistan is greatly  enhanced and "substantiated" by the famous
critic's comments.
                   Karl Rove famously said that the power and  work of
Empire is not so much in "changing reality," as simply in "creating
Reality." "Creation" opens the door to the "creation of documents," ot the
"creations of Authorized texts, versions, visibilities and invisibilities."
In trying to change reality, one is endlessly encountering obstacles,
struggles, the actual presence of peoples who do not want to accept the
"gift" of Occupation and the occupiers' ideas of "Freedom" and "well being.=
"
To "Create Reality" in effect erases and obviates any such "trivial"
considerations.
              To "create reality" allows one full reign to overstep all
bounds, and simply direct the attention of Vision to those things which
cooraborate and substantiate it, while all else is "rendered" invisble or
"suspect," and shipped off to the Gulags and Camps of the Living Dead.
               Amidst a series of images showing Senator Obama at the
Wailing Wall, the commentators prepare one for the Global, Historic Speech
to be delivered today in Berlin, the site of the Wall which JFK and Ronald
Reagan used  so effectively in their campaigns and Presidencies.
              In this latest stage in the Creation of Reality, the presence
of the now absent Berlin Wall will loom very large indeed, so large that it
will obscure the Apartheid Wall which Obama "overlooked" as well as the
Walls built in Baghdad and the so far failed attempts by Israeli firms to
construct an "Invisible Virtual Wall" for the American border with Mexico.
              As "The End of History," the Fall of the Berlin Wall remains
as an image of jubilation, of Triumph, of Freedom, of the Unity of a
Separated People.  Its very absence  has become such an immensely  potent
text in the Creation of Reality, that it makes nearly invisible the actual
Walls which will someday find their ultimate expression in the "Invisible
Virtual Wall" necessary in the "sci-fi" sounding "Defense Against Illegal
Aliens."
             Fellini's cinematic conception of Science Fiction set in the
Past  has become, "after the End of History," the Guiding Light of the New
Reality as expressed in such forms as the New Extreme Experimental American
Poetry and Arts.  A famous and respected literary and especially Biblical
critic commenting on the Next President's poetry reassures one that the
Candidate is indeed one who is worthy of being entrusted with a Biblical
Mission & Biblical Vision as part of the Creation of Reality.
        After all, in their own form of Science Fiction Set in the Past tha=
t
is to be the Future, the American settlers many of them saw in the
Wilderness the site of the New Jerusalem.  A Biblical message and vision wa=
s
was found to be "already inscribed" as the Manifest Destiny of the
continent.  To Enact the Word which formed them, these settlers had no
problems at all with the extermination of indigenous peoples and consigning
them, "savages" "terrorists," soulless and thus nonhuman," to live out the
rest of their wretched "Stateless"  existences locked up, confined to camps
from which water was diverted, hunting and trade denied,  their cultures
expunged, and a Living Death provided in the form of "Government Aid."
         Even in the most sophisticatedly high tech environments, the
Science Fiction of the Past sets all machines in the direction still of the
Authenticity and Authority of the Written Word.  The "Truth" about
"Forgeries," and the "forging of the Truth," the Authority figure
Authenticating as it were the poems of the Next President of the United
States as indeed poetry, all these Ancient methods, far older than Biblical
writings, are being disappeared from their "Homeland' in Iraq.
         Perhaps in the existence of writing itself, it is "already written=
"
that a War based on a Forged Letter and Imaginary and plagiarized
"evidences" would some day come to as much as possible obliterate and erase
from existence, from readability, the "original sites" of writing and
forgeries, so that these may be taken possession of and moved elsewhere,
firmly established as part of the Creation of Reality, and so consigning
these "insurgents," "enemy commbatants," "terrorists," "heathen," to their
"liberated" existences behind Walls dividing their cities, in refugee camps=
,
innumerable secret prisons and torture chambers,  and a landscape without
any but minimal utltilities, water, safety, education, health care, peace.
A place of the ceaseless restlessness of millions of dead and dsiplaced
persons, condemned and flung into the Living Hells of the Living Dead.
         And, one is told, instead of the debacle and defeat of Iraq, this
is the "Right War," which still lies ahead in the never ending centuries of
wars in Afghanistan, as well as the looming attacks on Iran.
           All of these things, one is often told, explained to,
dissertated  and expatiated on at lengths worthy of provoking Jeremiads, (
also receivers the critical attentions of Dr Bloom), by passersby, bus
riders, persons met here and there--all of these things after all, prove
indeed that they are  "already written" in the "Book of John" and the "End
Times" are at hand.
          Who knows,-as one of these characters might say, a further "proof=
"
is that a forger of letters is writing a book in which she "comes clean" in
time for the Last Judgement?!
          "Who's that writing?
                John the Revelator--
                     Tell me now, who's that writing?
                                John the Revelator
                                    Somebody say, say----who's that writing=
?
                                          John the Revelator wrote the Book
of the Seven Seals"

Hypertext is about 'links'. That doesn't always relate to 'ownership',
Murat. To put it another way, I don't think that hypertext, as a form,
implies anything about ownership. Ideas of ownership are as additional
axioms in the unetverse.

One may link to a page and, instead of the page coming up when the link is
clicked, a dialog box may come up asking for one's username and password.

Someone said something like "information wants to be free". I expect what
underlies that sentiment is what motivates your statement. One has to give
to get. Give good information to get any sort of possibility of making money
in conjunction with the giving. Or something like that. But that is less a
specifically hypertext-related phenomenon as something more general, I
think.

Jim,

I always thought hypertext was a text with multiple authors, created by the
addition of multiple, different texts? Was I wrong?

Tim Peterson, or Trace, enjoys electronic interaction as much as the next
poet, but WHERE IS ALL THE FUCKING? It's taking place in a hidden room
somewhere behind and within language as the vehicle of power, engendering
two ships passing, feeling toward the next dumb syllable or limb. For
further information, see SINCE I MOVED IN (which received the Gil Ott Award
from Chax Press) and EOAGH: A Journal of the Arts.

The son of white trash asphyxiation, CAConrad is the author of *Deviant
Propulsion* (Soft Skull Press) and *(Soma)tic Midge* (FAUX Press).
Forthcoming books include *The Book of Frank* (Chax Press), and a
collaboration with poet Frank Sherlock titled *THE CITY REAL & IMAGINED:
Philadelphia Poems *(Factory School Press).  He's at

Laura Goldstein recently graduated with an MFA from the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago. Her performances and installations have been exhibited
in Philadelphia, Ireland, Chicago and Michigan. She's been published online
in The Little Magazine, Great Works and MPRSND and in print in Combo,
Dorothy's Elbow and XConnect. Her new Chapbook, out from Hex Press, is
titled "Ice In Intervals".

What if the center of art were in between the ears?

I live near 'The Centre of the Universe' (so it is called), an observatory
in Saanich. Which is nearby Victoria. Which is near the south of Vancouver
Island. Which is in Canada, in British Columbia. Which is the north of north
america but south enough for sunshine in the seventies for weeks on end this
summer. and the smell of womens' skin on the beach in the sun.

Lest I appear too absolutely me-centric... the idea that the centre is
everywhere and nowhere is quite old. Pascal, I believe, was the originator.

Centres of art have different properties such as their 'market value' and
the 'market value of their artists'. Can it be made to sell enough to
justify its existence, plus whatever other existences must be justified via
its debts and proceeds? Art succeeds in a gallery on this basis or it won't
be there for long--the art and the gallery.

Let's make that an axiom of the unotverse, shall we? The unotverse being
inverse to the unetverse both of which are contained within the universe. I
was transferred to the unitverse but on the journey spent many nights in the
unytverse. by that i mean the unyt and its verse. not the uny tverse. though
it could be a class, a verse class of type uny, which could be a verse
program from uny. darn. we're there again. i suddenly feel broacast to the
unutverse. the unut verse chides me in the obvious manner plus ones it took
time to learn.

all in all, however, the combinatorium of universes is part us, we each are
the makers of our synthesis of the shared and the personal and inject that
serum into the dna of the mosquitoe.

toward the bottom of the turtles that were turtles all the way down, is
there a way things are? yes, well. things are the way they are independent
of us or with our action or influence. those we do not act on or influence
are just about everything. yes many ways things are, including often
unknown.

centres of art can be art marketing centres without being centres of the
production of art. marketing centres can be prohibitively expensive for art
production. except on thursdays in the studio.

Is that on the net? What is the URL, if so? Sounds interesting.

Not the spirit and direction of it, Murat--just the odd thing like
hypertext, as noted in my previous post. Your post seems to have inspired
some correspondence--usually a very good sign. Of what? Well, generative
capacity. Generative capacity is equal to the quality of the post * its
connection with peoples' hearts minds eyes ears experience conflicts ...
programming deprogramming
houses of high binary trees
forests of hashed lists
their object members
the objects' data
the objects' methods
the objects' constructors
the objects' destructors
the objects' world view
the objects' universe
the objects' unetverse
the objects' unytverse
the objects' unitverse
the objects' unotverse

the unatverse is under construction. is it the universe of ankle biters?

ah well poetry has been known to live there also. the ankle biters are
vicious and sometimes lethal, but they have to bite hard.

the bigger they are the harder they fall. from poets to presidents. from the
centre to the outer rings of hell. in come the universe unetverse unytverse
unitverse unotverse unatverse for all. or not, as the universe and reader
decrees.

by the way, the unitverse is one verse wide, one verse high, one unetverse
verse in connectivity, one unotverse as inverse of the unetverse (each
connection in the unetverse is present where before it was not, and is
absent when it was present); the unitverse is one unytverse verse in
darkness and neon; is one unatverse verse in ankle biters at work at the
critical and exposed levels of the art communi[ca]t[ion]y and political
int[erv]ention.

in short, i enjoyed your post. thanks, Murat.

Cervena Barva Press is pleased to announce the publication of
"The Season Of Love" by Flavia Cosma

Flavia Cosma is an award winning Romanian-born Canadian poet, author
and translator. She has published thirteen books of poetry, a novel,
a travel memoir and three books for children. Her book, 47 Poems,
(Texas Tech Press) received the ALTA Richard Wilbur Poetry in
Translation Prize. Èervená Barva Press published her chapbook,
Gothic Calligraphy and will be publishing her newest collection,
Songs at the Aegean Sea.

"Once again in The Season of Love, Flavia Cosma offers us those
momentary glimpses and sensations briefly felt and viewed which hide
and yet reveal the testament of life. Through the transient
sensations of reality, the poet lures her readership deep into the
mystic world of her eternity. Each poem serves to lead the reader
through the pain, suffering and loneliness of life while searching
for truth's hidden mysteries which serve to make life meaningful and
beautiful, yet remain to be discovered in that continual renewal and
rebirth of life."
David Mills, poet and critic
Toronto, Canada

"One of prevailing themes in Flavia Cosma's poetry is love, but not
as a banal, run-of-the mill experience. Instead, it has the
elemental intensity of natural phenomena, which best picture both
the breakdown of feelings and the undying hope. And that's where the
poet places her wise optimism."
Dr. Irena Harasimowicz-Zarzecka
PHD Philology, University of Bucharest, Romania
Toronto, Canada

 For all of you fellow domestic summer weekend slackers(!), you might be interested in a new "City Psyche" blog series I have started - camera and journal in hand - exploring San Francisco streets again. To get some some sense, the opening passage goes:


 A current challenge is to look for signs (text, image, etc.) that work as collective epiphanies of life in this City, if not across the nation, globe, etc. That is to explore the ways in which individual and collective psyche emerge in an identifiable configuration. The process is probably most taken from some combination of Jersey Grotowski’s, Towards a Poor Theatre, and the principles of Arte Povera.   The brief sum of which is to work the streets and - not ruling out the complex - to find texts and images within simple and/or found materials. The additional task is not to belabor a critical definition of any discovery. In fact, the primary impulse is to use eyes and ears - or any of the other senses - reveal what makes for awe. I don’t mean awe in a shallow, romantic sense. But to find those situations in which the senses are penetrated in such a way as to make you stop in your own tracks, either for a second or an enduring space of time.
    For example, I am walking across Guerrero at 19th Street at dusk on a Friday evening. A young woman on a cell-phone is in the cross-walk just ahead of my step. “Don’t be fashionably late, sucker,” she says, her voice at full volume.
 Your comments always appreciated.

This has been an interesting ongoing dialogue regarding capitalism and its role in the art world and purported lack of relevance in the poetry world.

"Capitalism is largely irrelevant to poetry," as a statement / generalization gave me great pause.  I realize the context of the coversation has been production and mass deployment so to speak of art/poetry as products/ commodities.

However, the world is largely relevant to poetry and the world, let's face it, is run by multinational late capitalism (a la Jameson).

I agree that one needs less money to write poetry vs. to produce a film or even large paintings (supplies and a space to paint and the luxury of time), etc.

However, the production, publication, and dissemination of poetry is still connected to capitalist-dominated contemporary culture.  How many children/people out there do not have a computer, do not have access to the internet global highway and its information, have not had a proper education . . .

Even the "avante garde" or experimental poets have to admit, sadly, that most of us have had some access and priviledge.  I know we're not paid for our work--there's not a large market for poetry-- although tons of people seem to be reading Billy Collins and Maya Angelou--

I may have taken this conversation on a tangent but felt compelled to comment on the relationship of capitalism to poetry.

Thanks for those of you who have read to the end during these busy times : )

Hi Murat,

If this is what you think hypertext is, then I can see why you might say
that "hypertext, as a form, is the literal expression of the idea of
non-ownership." Makes sense. But your def of hypertext is wrong.

Hypertexts usually do link to other texts by other authors, and the links do
erm sort of make them all into one text, in some sense, but the crucial
thing in the definition of hypertext is the link. Whether it's to a
different part of the same document or to a different document or image or
program or whatever. See, for instance, the defs of hypertext at
http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hypertext ,
http://www.w3.org/WhatIs.html and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext

Part of what's been going on is that so many post-Reagan gays, like so many
of their straight counterparts, indignantly assert their right not to be
associated with the kind of fiery agitators and revolutionists who made
things happen in the sixties and seventies. Fine, if that's what you want.
The problem is, those of us not interested in taking that
God-Country-and-Family route become subject to such majoritarian bullying as
"If you don't join the fight to allow gays to serve in the military, you are
an obstacle in the path toward full equality." It's tribal.
It's also somehow creepily related to earlier posts here suggesting that any
poetry not immediately accessible to "ordinary people" is elitist.

CAConrad, it's evident to me that your concern is over the war, and not the=
 basic human rights of anyone who wishes to fight for or against the war, e=
ither from within the military or from outside its ranks. Gays and bis can =
kill people as easily as straights can kill people. (Is accidentally or int=
entionally infecting someone with HIV a murder, or a mistake, or a write-of=
f? Sex is dangerous too...) But I digress...=20

Did the KKK disband? I'm not sure. But there are plenty of minorities who g=
ravitate toward things that can harm them. For example, any queers who belo=
ng to the Log Cabin Republicans may at first seem to be doing a disservice =
to  homosexuals by actively participating in a party that continues to ban =
gay marriage and condone bigotry and discrimination in lieu of adopting an =
egalitarian stance regarding sexual preferences and sexual acts. Yet, the p=
eople who join that faction have some vested interest in and attraction to =
the (perhaps oxymoronic) tenet that it tries to uphold.=20

Same thing with those who delight in joining the military. By banning a gro=
up--any group--from enlisting, we are promoting prejudice and therefore sen=
ding signals that anyone who identifies as a part of that group is unworthy=
, unlikeable, unfit, and less than human... It seems only fair that if a bi=
sexual or homosexual person wishes to bear arms and engage in battle as san=
ctioned by the United States or any other country, then they should be allo=
wed to enlist. Is a guy who chooses to breed a better fighter than one who =
lusts after his own sex? That is the argument brewing. To that, we need to =
say: "No, a person's sexual appetite has no bearing on how good of a soldie=
r he is." (Otherwise, we'd amass an army of man-hating lesbians to fight an=
 all male "enermy" army.) Police officers, too, fall into this dilemma. Any=
 profession, actually, can be reduced to whether or not a man will fuck or =
fight an enemy of the same, or opposite, sex... A homo on Wall Street? no w=
ay! he'd want to take the competition to bed! etc.

On the flip side, your "FUCK THE BRITISH ARMY" does have historical merit, =
as immigrants to what became the United States said much the same thing bef=
ore the country got its footing. Our ancestors' guerilla tactics and snipin=
g at the red coats, and throwing all that tea into the Atlantic, was a logi=
cal inevitability after the Mayflower folk and others expatriated in droves=
 to the "unsettled land". (Ignorning, of course, the fact that there were m=
illions of people already living here.) Yes, it's too bad that war and host=
ility exist. But to berate a law intended to dismiss an egregious human rig=
hts error seems more like misplaced anger than productive action.=20=20=20

James

BTW: From what I know about the Stonewall riot, it consisted of a few drag =
queens throwing pumps at police after the legendary Judy Garland passed out=
 and died in a pool of drug and alcohol-induced puke. Nobody "risked their =
lives" to continue with the drag show and the cocktail banter.=20

Dreams of Better Worlds Concrete

| http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22

| Images from intractive avatar game in The Accidental Artist exhibition,
| SL; avatar movement deconstructs architecture, frees the space. No
| score, no wins or losses; continuous play produces continuous
| deconstruction. The video is in black and white; color from the site
| refuses to compress properly.

Think of it: Second Life (or similar virtual spaces) as a simulacrum of
humanity's dream of flying, of malleable space and time; think of SL as a
laboratory for the practical/theoretical phenomenology of space and time.
What occurs in human flight, in the presence of strangers, in weight=
lessness, in sudden weight, in anonymity, in exposure, in agoraphobia or
clausterphobia? I work daily and nightly in the exhibition space, trying
things out, not primarily for the aesthetics, but for the cog-sci, psycho-
logical, psi-a comprehension that may or may not occur. Lacan or Minsky
might not be at home in these spaces, but they exist on the periphery of
theory. It's far too easy to dismiss virtual spaces in relation to what
might be considered the other, in terms of community, politics, political
economy, information economy, religion, etc. But first there is community
in SL, ideological struggle, etc., although not played out against the
scarcity of necessary resources; bandwidth and prim number are irrelevant
compared to lack of food or sleep. On the other hand it's the very absence
of noise that makes SL more like a savanna than an urban center, and a
savanna that at times allows one to speak and perceive with a clarity
bordering on the uncanny. While it may be slightly difficult learning to
move smoothly through SL, it's no more difficult than learning a sport or
board-game, and the results are equally enriching.

I don't want to sound like an advertisement for SL or virtual worlds in
general - but I do want to indicate their potential for psychological and
phenomenological experimentation. What one sees can be seen from one's
home; there's an established intimacy that the heavy cultural institut-
ionalization of museums and galleries doesn't have. The economy is on a
far smaller scale as well; over the years I've been on SL for example,,
I've paid eight dollars and eighty cents in real money for uploads to the
SL server - a small price, given the potential. Most of what I construct -
animations, textures, sounds, texts, prims, are created with open source
software outside SL.

To fly, to make objects disappear and appear at will, to revolve or
otherwise motivate them, to ignore or stress gravity, to move among the
problematic of things, to move through them, to court invisibility, to
view oneself from one's body or alterity, to speak or write (courting both
phoneme and grapheme), to operate within or beneath erasure, to create or
annihilate, send objects into or out of the world - to do any of these
things, and more, in any combination - within the limits of the computer -
limits which are perhaps far too often emphasized (instead of seeing
potential and the potential for expansion) - this is what, for the moment
while the net is up and running - this is what we can work with, in how-
ever limited our physical off-world conditions might be - and this is the
promise, holding for the slightest while - for the premise of communica-
tion or its lack, analogic inert and digital coded and their intermingled
limits. It continues to surprise me, how many complaints there are about
these worlds, from lambda-moo and earlier, and how little joy is expressed
over their current possibilities - what they can do _now._ Forget the
holodeck; there are already (what would have passed for) miracles afoot.
This isn't arguing against the need for deconstruction and critique of
SL's and other virtual worlds' political economy - just that one can
proceed in addition from the bottom up, seeing for example what happens
when a prim is grounded or sent elsewhere, say, into another physics, with
a shape-rider upon it, another shape-rider perhaps desperately controlling
the action, such as it is.

Then again, what constitutes a prim, a thing, a thing-in-itself, a proto-
col, a code, an atom, a table of elements or fundamental particles, a
resonance or plasma sending material worlds askew, exhausted, towards the
defuge of potential (but never complete) annihilation? And what better way
to think these things through, than to try them, on however distorted or
miniscule a scale. -

Dearest anyone in the Las Vegas area,

I'm in the process of moving to the Las Vegas area. Do good bookstores
exist out here? Please let me know what I might be able to find, as
far as independent bookstores or any interesting reading series--a few
word about art galleries and music would be great as well.

Hi Krysia,

money talks, certainly. but it doesn't write very well and apparently is not
particularly discerning concerning poetry.

whatever one may say about the state of poetry, at least it is not dominated
by the rich. there is very little money to be made at it, in it, through it.

i remember attending a talk by a prominent canadian art curator. he said "an
artist without a gallery is nothing". i can't see a publisher, say, having
the presumption to feel that a poet without a traditional publisher is
'nothing'. well, they *might* feel that way, but the reality is different.
the internet has opened possibilities for poetry that have decreased the
power traditional publishers--and the whole apparatus of print--have over
what gets disseminated and put before the public.

there actually has been the decentralization in matters of poetry that
theory posited more or less across the board--which hasn't happened.

Hello, listservians!

I've just started PROJECT SPICER, a blog meant as a repository for notes, essays, thoughts, discussions, facts and factoids about Jack Spicer's magnificent poetry. Anyone who'd like to is welcome to join as a member (in which case you can post past or present text), to comment, to correspond or just read. I'll also be cultivating a set of links to Spicer-related pages; if you've got one you think I should put in the sidebar, let me know.

It's at
http://projectspicer.blogspot.com

And I'm at
agricevich@gmail.com

all the best to all,

Andy G.

Jim,

I always thought hypertext was a text with multiple authors, created by the
addition of multiple, different texts? Was I wrong?

Jim,
If links were only within one's own text -or within one single text- that
would not be particularly interesting. What makes the concept of hypertext
radical is the joining of multiple authors into a single, meta-text.

Honestly, it does not matter to me how others may define hypertext. The
ability to link, by itself, is a technical advance. It is in the concept of
authortship that linkage becomes a conceptual jump. Also, of course, links
may alter our senses of time and space and linear continuity, relating to
the idea of worm holes. But that is a subject to discuss another day.

Ciao,

Murat

Synesthesic Cell Structures

a performance event with music, film, and poetry



Monday, August 18 (8 p.m.)

at The Cell



The sonic flavors of brushstrokes, the smells of musical improvisation, the
tactile textures of poetic images, synesthesia. Over centuries artists
working in a range of media have been inspired by other art forms, and they
have drawn on expressions in other art forms to explain and map out creative
forays along spectrums of genres. Hunches about these connections can lead
to investigations into parallel processes and new angles. During this event
we explore correspondences among and interstices between art forms-focusing
on music, film, and poetry. The following films will be shown while music
and poetry is performed: Ginta Gets His Car Washed, by Rona Mark;
Tumbleweed, by Brian Fitzhugh; Sumi-e, by Jayve Montgomery; Becoming
Formless and Love in Outer Space and Under Water, by Annie Heckman; Reflect
and Cityscape #1 by Mikey Peterson; and several others.



Performers:

Bruce Eisenbeil -- guitar

Tara Betts -- poetry

Tom Abbs -- upright bass, violin, didgeridoo, & tuba

Reed Robins -- keyboards

Dan Godston -- trumpet & poetry

Josh Sinton -- baritone saxophone & bass clarinet

Ravish Momin -- percussion

very interesting, Murat. my reflections on your post have tended to go in
various directions.

i think it's true that the act of creating a site or a blog and how it links
out to other sites, blogs, and specific texts within those is more
significant than we often realize. google and other technologies do not
create that web. google merely maps it, as it were, provides a way to
navigate it. if one has a site or a blog, it's good to keep the links
working, when possible, and to delete them if they're not going to work
anymore. tools like Xenu ( http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html ) make
this manageable; it tells you what links on your site are not working. i use
it several times per year and do the work to fix the links on vispo.com that
aren't working. sometimes the pages have moved. sometimes they don't exist
anymore. one comes to see which of the projects one has linked to have
authors that are serious about some sort of long-term committment to what
they have created.

the definition of hypertext. the literary significance of hypertext. the
formal significance of hypertext. the technical significance of hypertext.
different but related things. and also in relation to many other things.
such as the notion of a network. one may have hypertext without a network,
on a single computer. and of course hypertext is in relation to html
(hypertext markup language) and http (hypertext transport protocol). and the
browsers that read html and negotiate http requests.

and hyptertext is also in relation to, say, javascript, a programming
language that browsers (and other programs) can execute.

here is a "joining of multiple authors into a single, meta-text", Murat:
http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts/1.html . You can click the colophon to cycle
between the three texts (by Jerome McGann, Joseph Weizenbaum, and Leo Marx)
or mouseover the texts to have them intermingle. There are no 'links' here
in the conventional sense, but the piece can be conceptualized as involving
links, nonetheless.

James, let me say first that your p.s. (or BTW) about Stonewall diminished
the importance, as well as the received blow of the night.  It was not some
silly drag throng screeching at police, it was FIERCE drag queens,
transgender folks, AND BUTCH lesbians who took the cops on.  Marsha P.
Johnson was the first.  And upon meeting her shortly before her murder she
pointed out to me that she was homeless, living in Tompkins Square Park, and
organizing homeless people for Homeless Theater.

But my point further is, that NOT only was this RIOT initiated by drag
queens and butch lesbians, BUT BY AFRICAN AMERICAN drag queens and butch
lesbians.  The famous Martin Duberman book STONEWALL has a photograph on the
cover which doesn't begin to make clear that STONEWALL was a black gay bar.

Point further is that YES these people risked their lives.  You think
FIGHTING with cops, especially 1969 cops who KNEW JUST HOW sanctioned gay
bashing was, was not risking your life?

And whether or not we want to discuss HOW BRUTAL that night was, THAT NIGHT
led to a revolution, one which I for one am most grateful for!  Was Marsha
P. Johnson a revolutionary?  YOU  BET SHE WAS!

To the point of gays in the military, how can I make myself any clearer than
I already have?  My biggest problem (not with you or what you say so much as
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IN GENERAL WITH) with this idea of "equal rights" is that
I'm more interested in NOT BEING KILLED or harassed, first and foremost.

To sound utterly paranoid, though I do not believe I am, I FIRMLY BELIEVE
that Bill Clinton had every intention of bringing queers to the Right of
politics by giving focus to the military.

I heard with my OWN EARS during his first campaign for the presidency Bill
Clinton give a speech in DC at a gay pride function where he told us YES of
course you should be allowed to marry and have the same rights, blah blah
blah, to which he did nothing.

Gays in the military was BENT (so to speak) on making the queer community
forego it's radical ends, because the radical ends, such as ACT UP, were
bridging to other activist groups, and IF HE COULD GET US TO get on the same
page as the military, THEN HE HAD US RIGHT WHERE HE WANTED US.

The idea of ASKING to fight FOR a country in battle when that very country's
governmental body disallows marriage, disallows work in some states,
disallows adoption, etc. etc., is ludicrous!  It's like when African
Americans were asked to fight in war when they had to drink out of separate
water fountains, not vote, sit on the back of the bus.

But I say NO to the military.  We need to get THE FUCK OUT of Iraq and start
making room for ALL AND ANY Iraqi citizen who needs shelter and help HERE in
the states!  There's no way we can EVER repay the people of that nation for
what we have done, and the VERY LEAST we can do is make room for them here.
It's impossible for us to imagine what life is like over there.

I said this to someone recently, about allowing Iraqis into the states for
assistance, and he said, "But our economy is already in shambles!"  OUR
ECONOMY?  THAT'S what we should worry about?  NOT helping suffering people
whose suffering OUR TAX DOLLARS paid for?  I OWN the bullets I paid for by
saying we need to help these people!  The president has no trouble sleeping
at night but I do!

Oh, and the so-called Stonewall Diversity Committee is going to hear from me
because I'm going to attend a fricken meeting and tell them all to FUCK OFF
with their honoring an army guilty of war crimes!  That award is a disgrace
waiting to be called what it is!

And no James, I actually don't think it's separate issues.  I'm all for gays
being thrown out of the military.  Yes, discriminate at will if it means
depriving the war machine its fodder!

Gabrielle, not sure where you live, but YOU, and everyone and ANYONE is
welcome to read Mina Loy's poems at the URCHIN reading event in
Philadelphia.

I'm hoping someone wants to read her manifesto for women's rights.  If not I
WILL, BECAUSE I LOVE IT!

Where she asks IS THIS ALL YOU WANT TO HAVE WHAT MEN HAVE, I ask the same
for queers about what heterosexuals have.

MINA LOY WILL NOT STOP INSPIRING THE WORLD!

In the two months that I've been using the blog as a medium, I've been =
thinking how much it reinforces my need to assemble and anthologize or =
to use the anthology as such as a kind of manifesto.  The process before =
this has occupied much of my energy over the last forty years, but the =
difference here is that I can work on my own time and move almost =
instantly from private idea to public appearance.  I don't know how far =
this takes either me or it, and for the moment I don't really care - the =
great pleasure coming in the act itself.  I also welcome the chance to =
honor poets who have been close to me and to preview - for myself and =
anyone who watches - work in its slow progression to publication in =
paper or book form (or work, for that matter, that will never find any =
other format).  I assume that this matches the experience of others =
working in this medium.

surely this qualifies as poetics...


Trails


I can see if someone has come into the exhibition space in Second Life;
they leave a trail behind them, objects and spews that slowly disappear -
in the meantime, the space is oddly denuded.

I want to explain why the space looks like an acid trip, why it's so
crowded, so preposterous. And the reason has to do with anti-art, or
non-art, making something that construes an environment instead of
presenting an object or installation for contemplation. The objects in the
SL exhibition have depth; they're not pieces or scatter pieces or process
work - they're environment, an environmental space close to useless,
replete, fecund. What appears to be actions are trajectories, complex
interactive fields that mimic sentience.

Objects and spews head toward the depths; Julu is down there among them,
moving in and out of the way, looking for the teleport sphere to return
her to the surface. The teleport sphere is a phallic object, contained,
curtailed; it is the only sculpture in the neighborhood.

http://www.alansondheim.org/inthepit.mp4

Think of the space, spacings, as an ensemble of interrelated ecological
niches; there are local customs, nestings, vectors, behaviors and behavior
collisions. The space is utterly transformed through participatory move-
ment that environmental resonates.

It's only this way that complex and alien phenomenologies assert them-
selves - there's no piece or artwork presenting one or another problema-
tic, only a skein or membrane simultaneously tending towards thought and
its absence.

CAConrad, it's evident to me that your concern is over the war, and not the=
 basic human rights of anyone who wishes to fight for or against the war, e=
ither from within the military or from outside its ranks. Gays and bis can =
kill people as easily as straights can kill people. (Is accidentally or int=
entionally infecting someone with HIV a murder, or a mistake, or a write-of=
f? Sex is dangerous too...) But I digress...=20

Did the KKK disband? I'm not sure. But there are plenty of minorities who g=
ravitate toward things that can harm them. For example, any queers who belo=
ng to the Log Cabin Republicans may at first seem to be doing a disservice =
to  homosexuals by actively participating in a party that continues to ban =
gay marriage and condone bigotry and discrimination in lieu of adopting an =
egalitarian stance regarding sexual preferences and sexual acts. Yet, the p=
eople who join that faction have some vested interest in and attraction to =
the (perhaps oxymoronic) tenet that it tries to uphold.=20

Same thing with those who delight in joining the military. By banning a gro=
up--any group--from enlisting, we are promoting prejudice and therefore sen=
ding signals that anyone who identifies as a part of that group is unworthy=
, unlikeable, unfit, and less than human... It seems only fair that if a bi=
sexual or homosexual person wishes to bear arms and engage in battle as san=
ctioned by the United States or any other country, then they should be allo=
wed to enlist. Is a guy who chooses to breed a better fighter than one who =
lusts after his own sex? That is the argument brewing. To that, we need to =
say: "No, a person's sexual appetite has no bearing on how good of a soldie=
r he is." (Otherwise, we'd amass an army of man-hating lesbians to fight an=
 all male "enermy" army.) Police officers, too, fall into this dilemma. Any=
 profession, actually, can be reduced to whether or not a man will fuck or =
fight an enemy of the same, or opposite, sex... A homo on Wall Street? no w=
ay! he'd want to take the competition to bed! etc.

On the flip side, your "FUCK THE BRITISH ARMY" does have historical merit, =
as immigrants to what became the United States said much the same thing bef=
ore the country got its footing. Our ancestors' guerilla tactics and snipin=
g at the red coats, and throwing all that tea into the Atlantic, was an ine=
vitability after the Mayflower folk and others expatriated in droves to the=
 "unsettled land". (Ignorning, of course, the fact that there were millions=
 of people already living here.) Yes, it's too bad that war and hostility e=
xist. But to berate a law intended to dismiss an egregious human rights err=
or seems more like misplaced anger than productive action.=20=20=20

James

BTW: From what I know about the Stonewall riot, it consisted of a few drag =
queens throwing pumps at police after the legendary Judy Garland passed out=
 and died in a pool of drug and alcohol-induced puke. Nobody "risked their =
lives" to continue with the drag show and the cocktail banter.=20

Good luck, Cheryl. I've taught in China and it is a rich experience. I would
suggest two things: keep a blog going of photos and notes and messages to
'the outside world' while you are there, and a daily journal, either
handwritten or computerised. Throw in everything you can - the simplest
things in such a change of environment are quickly accepted, so you should
capture their novelty in the first place.

I am certain others who have done like trips would say the same.

CHERYL:

Brother Anthony, a member of the Catholic order of Taize, lives in Seoul & is quite generous re introducing people to Korean poetry and poets. you can contact him through his website, which is itself an _amazing_ resource for Korean poetry:

http://hompi.sogang.ac.kr/anthony/

also, poet Kevin Thurston is preparing to move to Korea. you can contact him through his blog:

http://fuckinglies.blogspot.com

Kevin also pointed out to me that Francis at Redfox Press, although he was previously located in Ireland, is now located in Seoul. he's an _excellent_ book artist. his blog:

http://franticham.blogspot.com/

Taegu is a wonderful city, tho I'm not familiar with any poets currently living there. the train ride from Taegu to Seoul however is about 2.5 hrs -- & every train has a vendor that sells beer, which makes the an incredibly scenic ride _much_ more pleasant!

Does anyone know of any poets in S. Korea? I'll be teaching for the year at
Keimyung University in Daegu, 200 miles south of Seoul. I'd love to meet
some poetry kin.

Bench of Memory at Slavery=92s Gateway

By FELICIA R. LEE
SULLIVAN=92S ISLAND, S.C. =97 Toni Morrison has said that her acclaimed =20=

novel =93Beloved,=94 which features the ghost of a baby killed by her =20=

enslaved black mother, came out of the need for a literature to =20
commemorate slaves and their history. =93There is no suitable memorial, =20=

or plaque, or wreath or wall, or park or skyscraper lobby,=94 Ms. =20
Morrison said in a 1989 magazine interview. =93There=92s no 300-foot =20
tower, there=92s no small bench by the road.=94
This weekend, on Sullivan=92s Island, off the South Carolina coast, Ms. =20=

Morrison, the Nobel laureate, and some 300 people held a memorial =20
ceremony to dedicate her long-awaited =93bench by the road.=94 The crowd =
=20
included members of the Toni Morrison Society, National Park Service =20
rangers, Ms. Morrison=92s friends and family, and people from Charleston =
=20
and nearby areas. They gathered Saturday afternoon under a blazing =20
sun, accompanied by the rhythms of African drums, for a service that =20
included the pouring of libations and a daisy wreath cast into the =20
water to remember their ancestors.
=93It=92s never too late to honor the dead,=94 said Ms. Morrison, 77, =
the =20
author of eight novels, as she sat down on the 6-foot-long, 26-inch-=20
deep black steel bench facing the Intracoastal Waterway. =93It=92s never =
=20
too late to applaud the living who do them honor,=94 she said. =93This =
is =20
extremely moving to me.=94
Sullivan=92s Island, home to Fort Moultrie, was a point of entry into =20=

North America for about 40 percent of the millions of Africans who =20
were enslaved in this country. Carlin Timmons, a park ranger, said =20
that all the estimates were rough, but that historians believe 12 =20
million to 15 million Africans came to the Americas and the Caribbean. =20=

Of those 4 to 10 percent were brought to North America.
The bench was secured by the National Park Service, which laid the =20
foundation that included a bronze plaque explaining its significance. =20=

It was the first entry in the =93Bench by the Road=94 project, created =
by =20
the Toni Morrison Society, a nonprofit group of scholars and readers =20
dedicated to examining Ms. Morrison=92s work. The society, which was =20
also holding a conference in nearby Charleston, plans in the next five =20=

years to call on individuals, corporations and community groups to =20
help them place benches at 10 sites.
The spots under consideration have significance in Ms. Morrison=92s =20
novels and in black history. They include Fifth Avenue in Harlem, =20
where the Silent Parade protesting the East St. Louis, Ill., riots was =20=

held in 1917 (featured in the novel =93Jazz=94) and the site of Emmett =20=

Till=92s 1955 murder in Mississippi, which helped galvanize the civil =20=

rights movement.
=93We have come back to the place we started from,=94 Carolyn C. Denard, =
a =20
founder and the board chairwoman of the Toni Morrison Society, told =20
the audience sitting under a big white tent, some furiously fanning =20
themselves. Dr. Denard, a dean at Brown University, said groups like =20
the Carolina Committee on Remembrance helped with the project.
At its founding in 1993 the society adopted as its motto =93a bench by =20=

the road,=94 based on Ms. Morrison=92s comments in the 1989 article in =20=

World, the magazine of the Unitarian Universalist Association. On =20
Saturday part of that interview was read, along with a passage from =20
=93Beloved,=94 which calls on black people to love one another in the =
face =20
of oppression and brutality.
=93When I wrote those words that they read, I was just reminiscing about =
=20
the necessity for literature, the necessity for African-Americans to =20
make their own art in their own words,=94 Ms. Morrison said in an =20
interview after the ceremony.
One of her favorite sites for a bench would be in Oberlin, Ohio, a =20
stop on the Underground Railroad near her hometown of Lorain, she =20
said. While a number of museums dedicated to black history have sprung =20=

up around the country since 1989, as well as much new scholarship =20
about black history Ms. Morrison said she liked the idea of an =20
=93unpretentious=94 bench for its simplicity and accessibility.
=93Well, the bench is welcoming, open,=94 she said. =93You can be =
illiterate =20
and sit on the bench, you can be a wanderer or you can be on a search.=94
And that search is for anyone, not just black people, she added. If =20
anything, with all the talk about race in this year of Senator Barack =20=

Obama=92s historic candidacy, Ms. Morrison said, she would like to see =20=

white people hold a conversation among themselves about the legacy of =20=

slavery.
=93African-Americans don=92t own slavery,=94 Ms. Morrison said. =93It=92s =
not a =20
brand because there were slave masters and there were abolitionists =20
and there were other people who died to see to it that justice was =20
done.=94
But before there is reconciliation or healing, there needs to be a =20
better acknowledgment of the past, said many of the participants in =20
Saturday=92s ceremony and the society=92s conference. That meeting=92s =
theme =20
was =93Modernism,=94 with scholarly sessions like =93 =91Tar Baby=92 and =
Global =20
Capitalism=94 and =93A Modernist Look at Milkman and Hagar in Morrison=92s=
 =20
=91Song of Solomon.=92 =94
Thomalind Polite, a 34-year-old speech therapist from Charleston who =20
helped Ms. Morrison throw the wreath into the water, said she came to =20=

honor her seventh-generation ancestor Mrs. Polite=92s distant relative, =20=

whose name was Priscilla, was 10 when she was stolen from Sierra Leone =20=

in 1756 and brought to Sullivan=92s Island, Mrs. Polite said. She wiped =20=

away a tear as she held the hand of her 6-year-old daughter, Faith.
=93I feel like a circle closed,=94 Mrs. Polite said of the ceremony to =20=

honor Priscilla and the mostly nameless, faceless people who came to =20
the island, surviving the Middle Passage, the brutal trans-Atlantic =20
journey from West Africa. =93She=92s finally getting the honor she =20
deserves.=94
By next summer an exhibition on the African presence is planned for =20
the visitors=92 center in Fort Moultrie, said Michael Allen, an =20
education specialist with the National Park Service. He noted that the =20=

first plaque commemorating Africans like Priscilla was placed in 1999, =20=

the money raised by, among others, graduates of black high schools in =20=

Charleston.
Mr. Allen spoke to the audience about the lives of those Africans. =20
They were quarantined in so-called =93pest houses=94 on Sullivan=92s =
Island =20
=97 long torn down =97 before they were sold into slavery. Many in the =20=

crowd wept as they read the plaque on the ground, which says that the =20=

bench honors the memory of enslaved Africans who arrived on Sullivan=92s =
=20
Island and of those who died during the Middle Passage. It concludes, =20=

=93Nearly half of all African-Americans have ancestors who passed =20
through Sullivan=92s Island.=94
On Friday night Ms. Morrison treated conference attendees to a reading =20=

from her ninth novel, =93A Mercy,=94 to be published in November by =
Alfred =20
A. Knopf. In the late 17th century a slave mother has given up her =20
daughter Florens to an Anglo-Dutch trader as partial payment for a =20
debt from a Maryland plantation owner.
Ms. Morrison said in the interview that the novel was her chance to =20
uncouple notions about race from the experience of slavery. Many white =20=

indentured servants had an experience that was not so different from =20
that of the enslaved Africans, she said.
=93There is a certain history that the historians know about and =20
artists, I think, know less about,=94 Ms. Morrison said.
=93There is no topic on anybody=92s table which does not involve black =20=

people,=94 she continued, mentioning education and health care. =93And =20=

when that disappears in time, then they have to do what they have been =20=

avoiding, which is talk about poor people.=94

I'm doing a video project where actors will say a line on camera about why they read.

?

It would great if list members could give me their one line reason why they read, concurrent with permission to use the line in my project.? There won't be any explicit credit for your contribution and the only consideration will be my gratitude for the assistance.

Compression's terrible. Emptiness lasts thirty seconds, up from twenty;
I'm not sure how many meters define the zone of influence. The stills
indicate the layout. This is a plateau of sorts. There's nothing beyond
this, only another direction. In the full video, Julu touches the sphere,
heads beneath the water. There she searches, finds another sphere, rises
once again to the surface or ground floor of the exhibition. What's in the
basement is debris from movement, i.e. debris tracking Julu's movement on
the surface or beneath the surface. What's above is the absence of debris
tracking Julu's movement on the surface or beneath the surface. There's no
way to adequately compress the enormous detail involved in the exhibition.
You can move or fly through the exhibition, experience emptiness, clarity,
in untoward terms. You can forget the terms. You can do all sorts of
things but you can do better than this.

Subject:      Ted Greenwald's 3 back at SPD
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"

Apologies to anyone who tried to order Ted Greenwald=B9s new book 3 from Smal=
l
Press Distribution a few weeks ago. They sold out almost instantly, but mor=
e
hardcover and paperbacks are now in stock.

Poet Ron Padgett writes: =B3Ted Greenwald's 3 takes the mind in at least thre=
e
different directions simultaneously, in hardboiled, richly detailed,
well-made poems whose giddy wordplay, pantoum-like interweavings, and nimbl=
e
jumpcuts create a sort of 21st-century Poet in New York. An inspired
challenge and a delight.=B2
=20
Filmmaker Nathanial Dorsky writes: =B3Within this selection of three works, w=
e
come upon the most unusual, if not revolutionary moment in the universe
called Ted Greenwald. Suddenly the risk of self as such takes place. Though
his poetry always bares the honest song of a fragmented accumulation, the
float of our existence, here Ted reveals an exposition of tender, romantic
suchness amidst rhythmic refrains classically structured and filled with
sunlight and place, the vulnerable underbelly of his Arcadian being is
unveiled.=B2
=20
While poet Tom Raworth reminds us to "Just read the fucking book."
=20
And Charles Bernstein wrote on his blog (07.24.08) =B33 brings together three
structurally related long poems, featuring Greenwald=B9s characteristic
vernacular insistence: =8CGoing into School that Day=B9 (1986), =8CAnyway=B9 (2001)=
,
and =8CDawn On=B9 (2002). =B3Going into School that Day,=B2 a love poem, alternates
between twenty-five sonnets and twenty-five quatrains in which every line
but the sixth appears twice (A B C A / C E A B). =8CAnyway=B9 consists of 33
double tercets, each line having mostly two but occasionally three phrases,
with two to four phrases from the first tercet repeated in the second. The
syntactically denser final poem, =8CDawn On,=B9 is 1521 lines; it=B9s the closest
Greenwald comes to a poem like Zukofsky=B9s =B3A=B2-23 (though Greenwald style is
much looser). =8CDawn On=B9 repeats only sporadic phrases or word pairs, in
unexpected sequences; but the overall effect, as with the other poems in th=
e
trilogy, is a modular static/dynamic line structure, in which lines delink
from their linear order to create a moir=E9-like effect, something Greenwald
has called =8Cjumping the line.=B9=B2

The cover was designed by typographic aficionado Rich Kegler of P22

Anna:

You can't do this; but of course you can, and I've done it myself: making a
recommendation without saying why. It's a protocol of e-mail that defeats
discussion, which is what lists such as this are for. You made me see the
error, thank you, and that I am interested in knowing your reasons for
recommending Susan Howe's "Pierce-Arrow."

Best,
Joel

Again, not poetry, but Rebecca Comay's massive Lost in the Archives is an

ah, alas, i cannot come (i truly wish i could...) because:

On August 2 at 6:30 pm at Redwood Gardens Senior Living Center in Berkeley
(and Aug. 3 at Ashkenaz), members of Ka Lei Maile Alii, a Native Hawaiian
Civic Club from Honolulu, will offer a program which includes a powerpoint
presentation about Hawaiian history, sovereignty and nationhood by David
Keanu Sai, and a re-enactment play, "The Queen's Women" or "Ka lei maile
alii" (the affectionate name--the maile lei of the alii-- given by Queen
Liliu'okalani to her closest friends). There will be a display table and
refreshments before and a feedback session after the play.  Hope some of
you can come to the Aug. 3 performance.

Written in 2001, the play is based on an article which you can read at
http://www.hawaii-nation.org/sfcall.html.  It was written in 1897 by a San
Francisco journalist, Miriam Michelson (played by yours truly) and covers
a meeting at Hilo Salvation Army Hall, where 300 people came together to
sign petitions against annexation of Hawai'i by the U.S.  Michelson took
down word for word the speeches and the audience's responses, and these
are transmitted in the play.

The Queen's women gathered 21,000 signatures in a few months, and the men
gathered another 20,000.  The petition was successful.  Annexationists
were unable to push through a legal treaty annexing the islands.  They had
to take Hawai'i by sleight of hand, which has significance today.  Keanu
Sai gives his presentation about sovereignty and nationhood, its meaning
then and today.  He also talks about the Akaka Bill's attempt to make
Native Hawaiians a tribe under jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of the
Interior, and what that means for present-day Hawaiians.

A KPFA radio interview with Keanu Sai can be accessed by going to
www.kpfa.org.  You click on programs, click on Thursday, July 17, click
on APEX Express at 7:00 p.m.  It's very informative.

Visual AIDS was founded in 1988 by arts professionals as a response to
the effects of AIDS on the arts community and as a way of organizing
artists, arts institutions, and arts audiences towards direct action,
Visual AIDS has evolved into an arts organization with a two-pronged
mission. 1) Through the Frank Moore Archive Project, the largest slide
library of work by artists living with HIV and the estates of artists
who have died of AIDS, Visual AIDS historicizes the contributions of
visual artists with HIV while supporting their ability to continue
making art and furthering their professional careers. 2) In
collaboration with museums, galleries, artists, schools, and AIDS
service organizations, Visual AIDS produces exhibitions, publications,
and events utilizing visual art to spread the message "AIDS IS NOT
OVER."

Brother Anthony Teague has given his days to translating South Korean
poets.  He was the head of the English dept. at Sogang University when I
last saw him years back and if he's still there, it would be well worth
a trip to see him.  He's a wonderful man and a fine poet in his own
right.

Check out his translations of Ko Un The Sound of My Waves (Cornell
University East Asia Program), and Beyond Self--108 Korean Zen Poems of
Ko Un.  He's done many more than these, though.  Jesse

Points noted, CAConrad. Although, if I may be so bold, I will reiterate my =
original point: sexual identity/orientation/preference is no grounds for di=
smissal from any military. In fact, throughout history, men (and a few wome=
n) in armies far and wide have actively engaged in homosexual behavior. Who=
 are you, or anyone else, to say that this group or that group should be ba=
rred from enlisting? What next, a return to denial of blacks and other "col=
oreds" to fight in an "American" army? By using the queer politics as a way=
 to diminish the scope of our armed forces, you seem to be a bigot using a =
law to further an anarchistic, hazy agenda.
=20=20
Resisting arrest and public intoxication, which were the actual crimes comm=
itted at Stonewall, are a far cry from a fed-up Rosa Parks calmly asserting=
 herself via passive resistence on a city bus. Sure, it was time for change=
, but peaceful marches and ploys to congressmen would've been a far better =
choice than dressing up and acting out-- The "riot" was all about the drink=
ing establishment being raided and shut down, rather than gay rights and eq=
uality-- Bars and coffeeshops catering to a variety of types were being shu=
t down all over the city. Gays were as much a target as other minorities, b=
ut we don't hear about their sequined stomps.

Further more, CAConrad, by labeling someone "fierce" or "butch" you are sur=
ely being glib and stereotypical. (And I, for one, detest Jerry Springer an=
d its colorful characters taken from real life; these sorts of role models =
can't be a good thing.) This is not the swingin' 70s, and many facets of re=
centy history are being rethought. Presenting an obnoxious behavior, as I'v=
e learned the hard way, is no longer celebrated. And congratulating someone=
 for being drunk and disorderly is way way way out of date.

Joe, that's a terrific suggestion. Though I've not read the entire work, I =
have proofread a portion of it, which is to be included in the forthcoming =
"Light Years: An Anthology on Sociocultural Happenings (Multimedia in the E=
ast Village, 1960-66)," edited by Carol Berge and published by AWAREing Pre=
ss and Spuyten Duyvil. Schwerner's chapter admits to a portion of the table=
ts being either lost or untranslatable, which is as comical as it is profou=
nd, and an elegant stab at finding an epitome of the 1960s.

Carol spent 20 years assembling this anthology of memoirs and ephemera. For=
 more info, including an excerpt from the introduction, visit www.awareingi=
nc.net and click on the AWAREing Press page.

Jerome, the blog is maybe a high-tech evolving of what was known as the Mim=
eograph Revolution in the 1960s, in which artists, writers, poets and print=
ers joined forces to disseminate new work as quickly as possible. Expeditin=
g innovations to the masses! And so, another boon, and another blow, to the=
 artist... My concern is that a copyright date, affixed by the creator of a=
n original piece, can be easily overwritten by a villainous plagiarist or a=
rt image thief... Am I crazy to worry? My MySpace page, which I tore down a=
fter about a month, had 147 hits on the blog page, but less than 100 on the=
 main page, after the first week. Disconcerting, those numbers-- especially=
 when most of the people offering friendship weren't people at all, but 'bo=
ts, advertising pay-for-smut links. To provide an open forum, a peek at an =
artist-at-work, is a way to approach the blog, though I remain skeptical of=
 too many unknown apprentices.=20=20=20=20

Brother Anthony is an excellent translator. I have several books of Korean poetry which he has translated, including those by Ko Eun ("The Sound of My Waves"), Chon Sang Pyong ("Back to Heaven"), and several others.

"The Book of Korean Shijo" (Harvard East Asian Monographs, trans. by Kevin O'Rourke) is a great book.

Brother Anthony, a member of the Catholic order of Taize, lives in Seoul & is quite generous re introducing people to Korean poetry and poets. you can contact him through his website, which is itself an _amazing_ resource for Korean poetry:

http://hompi.sogang.ac.kr/anthony/

also, poet Kevin Thurston is preparing to move to Korea. you can contact him through his blog:

http://fuckinglies.blogspot.com

Kevin also pointed out to me that Francis at Redfox Press, although he was previously located in Ireland, is now located in Seoul. he's an _excellent_ book artist. his blog:

http://franticham.blogspot.com/

Taegu is a wonderful city, tho I'm not familiar with any poets currently living there. the train ride from Taegu to Seoul however is about 2.5 hrs -- & every train has a vendor that sells beer, which makes the an incredibly scenic ride _much_ more pleasant!

Does anyone know of any poets in S. Korea? I'll be teaching for the year at
Keimyung University in Daegu, 200 miles south of Seoul. I'd love to meet
some poetry kin.

Isn't it the time of year that Brits pretend to be nice to each other in Nice!
 Get out of town, Girl, and shrink your antennae! Nobody is to be heard from, sighted or otherwise. & the language is dead,too.

 So, if you have to,  crawl in bed with a crook called 'sleep' and enjoy the robbery.

Sara Phillips,

You might investigate the work of John M. Bennett.  He is a
scholar-poet, a multi-lingual poet, a poet and visual-artist, a
concrete poet, etc., AND he is an archivist and librarian.  Several of
his books are "archives" in several senses of the word, PLUS he has
developed actual institutional Archives (more than one, of his own
work or the work of others) that are detailed and amazing and
dimensional.

I give his contact information below ...

tohttp://www.blogtalkradio.com/listenandbeheard/2008/08/20/Listen-Be-=20
Heard-Open-Mic.

The first portion of the show will feature poets who signed the open =20
mic list ahead of time at Listen & Be Heard Poetry Cafe Blog (http://=20
www.listenandbeheard.net/home). This will allow me to collect a bio, =20
a picture and a poem if you wish that I can feature on the web page =20
about the show ahead of time.

You will have a chance to participate in two rounds of open mic. The =20
first round will be the traditional Listen & Be Heard lightning =20
round. You will have thirty seconds or less to read a poem. This =20
allows all the poets to be heard right at the beginning. I will then =20
go to the second round when each of the featured poets will have five =20=

minutes to read a poem or selection of poems, and make an =20
announcement about your book, cd, upcoming appearances or whatever.

If you want to be a featured poet in the open mic please sign the =20
open mic list and I will get in touch with you by e-mail.

After each of the featured open mic poets have read, I will open it =20
up to listeners who have just tuned in to read one poem.
