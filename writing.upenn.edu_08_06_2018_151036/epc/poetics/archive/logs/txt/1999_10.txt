No, George, No, Ron, being a poet with a name that ends in N does not make
one a LangPo; but one cannot be (my lightsome observation runs) a LangPo
w/o a name that ends in N.       David.

Any "anywhere" come to in getting away from everywhere else can't really
"challenge" anything but the former assumptions about where it began, as if
that were somewhere, and which is so far in the past that it's probably been
forgotten, wch is why past habit is often confused with future prospects,
ie., both are blank.  & that's probably the more actual challenge, compared
to "the pedigree of assumption", which is a sort of rubber baby prophylaxis
formed of the mind that gets blank and stays blank rather than doing
something like stepping into it right where hours are said to flow into
rivers (this sounds a little too much like "etcetera" to really make a scar
in the face of the near-presence of any future, to me) and the whole nine
yeards, ie., having to wait to come full circle while making squares in
order to realize the work will go on because there's no way out not also
temporal - scary - so we spend/waste/buy/etc "time" by attempting a future
from here without the advantage of each our full weight to back us up THERE,
wch is the problem, time having always to swallow the sayings it dredges out
of its own ditches and makes new in a tommorow that never gets here because
it's very like the slogan we thus make out of ourselves, Junior Pioneers on
the morpheme trail,
telling it not like it IS, but rather more like the way it never quite
stays, insoluble.  Yet always within (almost easy, really) reach - the
"reason" the work DOES go on, like history, because its source is a "path of
least resistance" - receivership - whose causes seclude the present in a
stiff but still-near distance.  And ("therefore") quite naturally, we look
for more, in a time that "will be."  Sequentially.  Will have been goes
directly to has been, from wch vantage we look again, up, down, out, over,
across, at what may unfold of this standing tumult ever falling to the focus
of a mind's eye, mouthpiece unceasing toward a future, course of our
heritable romantic obligation, the Sisyphean rock from which the language
springs, by a process of fluid displacement.

                 --a jig in defense of offense --

I sort of thought, beguilingly transfixed by possibility, that a poetry
reading was a chance to pull a grapefruit from whatever tropical tree will
honour the request. at times, the regular incandescence of our illumined
brains is as glaring as the terpsichorean importance of true careerist
scholarship, give or take a few grad school mistakes. never have I been able
to say, till now, "truly women are the pelicans of mankind.", which
opportunity, frankly, I kinda dig. I, that is, who was born of woman (so far
as I know), and proud of the fact. perhaps men are (beyond disappointments)
cranberries, if language, that boding thing, will allow such a statement.
the point is not such arguments but questions of surge: as in: what if the
ship, I'm wondering, could travel to parts unknown? green vistas of
poetry-making heroes, on course and singing their dynamic brains out, that's
the scenario I see or urge. I wish I understood the invidious inflections, I
'm stuck in the trope of importance. who wins the primeval game, wearing
their school colours and repeating the authoritarian refrain of winner take
all, but those willing to prance on stage? let those who are serious prove
with their very words with a politics of singular bastard. after that, well,
let's explore the strict tempo ceili intricacies that corny people call
love. us against the ocean, tra la, till the end of tenure.

Cybele, panshaman@hotmail.com

Cybele screams for retreat--the longest day in virtual space never
ends, one day for all her memories--one datacluster for his anxious
intercourse--the lips sealed around wilderness might be sucking the
fantastic from the approximate. "YOU LAND THERE!" with no body &
a gender to boot. whose desire when the backstreets are filled with
academic junkies longing for a creative thot. "NO, NO, NO" noun
case & a blackened sunday when the tastes leave the mouth before
the food is eaten. "I WOULD LOVE YOU CYBELE" the chorus of
clearcutters rhymes while the biome disintegrates.

Even tho Cybele has grafted herself to the story of LOVEANDWAR
she cannot add herself to the cast of characters on the contents
pages. She will always be marginalized & forgotten, just as her
priests in the pits, blood of centuries & fertilities raining on them,
washing them away without an omen.

Humanity has left me behind because their blood is newer & spilled
with less cause. The priests of renewal are now car salesmen in
Akron, OH, but they are slippery now & will not give you the deal
they make you believe. Her ocean is washing over me, agitated like
war or dread anxiety. There must be others in this story who we are
forgetting, I have seen them pressing the submit button but they
never appear on their own, only their writers take credit for their
appearance when it is this noble cast that elaborates the theatre.

Thanks Ron...

The first thing I would bring up is a re-iteration of praise for the
work James Weil did with Elizabeth, both magazine and press. Most of the
author's Weil published on the press were picked up by other publishers
when they folded, Eigner, Neidecker, Enslin, Bronk, and so on, but
Perchik bounced from house to house, both university and non, only
having Dusty Dog and Shearsman (regular publishers of chapbooks) as
constant supporters. I became aware of Elizabeth by finally looking up a
Perchik book _Which hand holds the brother_  at the Schenectady Library
after seeing so many of his pieces in journals & bought _The club fits
either hand_ at the now defunct Boulevard Bookstore in Albany NY.

Perchik denies being serial in his work. And yet, there are a few
hundred poems from each: Family of Man series, the W series, and
another. Each time he finishes writing to a book of photographs the series
ends. There are elements of seriality from _Snowcat Poems_ onward. All I
know is, as an editor, I am very tired of * as a titling mechanism,
after inputting 15 books.

The stacks of prose, which were eventually paired down to _a_ poem, are
all archived at Princeton library if there is further interest about the
process.

While Si does carpet bomb all the journals out there, he also reads
them. I learned a phenomenal amount from him about journals such as
Golden Goose, Manroot, Black Mountain, Yugen, 50's/ 60's, Kayak, all
from the late forties to now. Perchik talks of magazines because they
are what his main source is, never anthologies. All of Perchik's
published books resulted from being in a magazine, then being asked
for a book, Pavement Saw is no exception. Perchik's main literary
influence, which I think is in the interview, is Vincente Alexandre'.
Corman, Olson, and Blackburn and others are contemporaries.

Be well

If I were a man, I'd write erection sonnets,
Like Will or Berryman, play with my name, my tools.
Instead I must be pregnant:
My severed tubes suspend all nature's rules,
Grow whole.  From a crowded room our separate
Clothed bodies levitate, naked, radiant,
To a solitude beneath the nose of no one.
Scandal's breath grows roses we are bedded on;
It is Adonis' garden: you are form
And I am Venus, all that matters
To the seedling future.  Possessing me you enter
The garden in the garden. What's invisible
Shall be real: here are words for it.

TOM BRIDWELL

FROM TEXT TOWARD BUILDING A HOUSE


2. Pulling the Starting Cord

I had forgotten those firm cowgirl asses encased so sweetly in fitted
jeans. The Miracle of Work. The slightly spread thighs from much riding.
I feel as though I was delaminating. In Colorado I price windows and
patio doors. In Utah I pick up the argon-filled thermopanes I had
stashed toward this house. Pack a ballast of books (to fill the space
tightly) and layer glass and one inch foam, wrap the guns in plastic
bags in case of rain. Grab a box of photos to remember the past.
February the 11th I pass papers on the land. The house grows in my mind
and I could build it from just a footprint. When I leave the girls
Samara is crying just barely under control.

We had a wonderful three days and nights. Motel in Utah with a
kitchenette and HBO; a lovely drive and hike in Arches. Time with
friends. We drive a lot, on these visitations, sharing whatever time we
can. Sun on sandstone wall on the river road, 128, along the waters. The
way the light strikes. Pepperoni and cheese discussing house sites at
the Dewey Bridge. Posing among the red rock. Ordinary things.

A Calvinistic moroseness (like a depressed dog staring at his bowl)
without any epistemology or even the vaguest theory, a dialog about
dialog, John and I, after everyone has left. It's snowing hard and we're
standing at the fire-pit, smoking; a conversation about the elusive
percentage, the critical mass, that might be required to represent any
actual thing. The salient cream that rises.

Then thinking that there will be at least part of another summer with
the girls in the trailer while building the house. Playing at house. No
room. Then back to the bonfire, all the while driving across Kansas.
John said 'it all comes from the Southwest now', and I can't remember if
it was the weather or culture. There are 54 fourteeners in Colorado,
always one in your face. I had to leave the west for fear of heights.

Coming back, the Little Wabash has flooded southern Indiana. You can't
see the river for the water. The conversation runs to drainage. Blue
Darter hawks work the edge of the road levee. A Magritte floatage of
farmers. As I remember, everything is gray, the water, the sky,
everything. Large areas, in the middle distance, where the sky meets the
water, lack any definition. Caffeine and sleep-deprivation are a
powerful drug. While everyone else sleeps, I think about the house
plans.

October is a full month for the ZINC BAR SUNDAY NIGHT READING SERIES, with
5 Sundays & 2 Emergency Midweek readings.  We have more readings this month
than most nations have in an entire year.  All this in the interest of
course of getting as many poets on board the ark before the millennial jig
is apocolyptically up.  So, to save some time, lets get right to the
rundown.

SUNDAY OCTOBER 3: CHRIS STROFFOLINO & JANET BOWDAN

SUNDAY OCTOBER 10: PIERRE JORIS & NICO HELMINGER & JEAN PORTANTE

with a hole where your mouth is.  Douglas & Brendan will provide candy,
though we will eat it ourselves while you read.

Here's how you can become a scheduled reader on the Zinc bar Sunday Night
Reading Series:
a) come to the Zinc Bar & during the break buy Douglas a drink.  - or -
b) come to the Zinc bar & during the break pick up a copy of Brendan's

Fundamental Systems (Was: Couplings and Linkages) {file:zz}

N a azure fbw julu kdate lisp lynx_bookmarks.html mail minicom.log newju
nsmail trace z.gif zz
Let's say there is a binary structure, consisting of an operation N such
that N(a,b) -> a relationship between a, b. Say that a, b are terms which
stand for sets of identical members, as far as the structure is concerned
- i.e. a = {x:x = a} & b = {y:y = b}. Note that x and y can be anything;
the terms are dummy. The structure is then S = (N,a,b).

Then we may be concerned with the _phenomenology_ of S, thinking through
the semantics of (a,b) in relation to the framework N. It is irrelevant
for example that if N = +, we might have +(4,3) = 7. We are not interes-
ted in constructing a result c - only that a relationship between a and b
is established.

For example, N = + resulting into the terms coalesced beneath the sign of
addition; N = red resulting into equivalence; N = identity producing the
singularity of a and b; N = existing at time t(N) resulting in a foreclos-
ing or frameworking of a and b; and so forth. We can have a linkage such
that if a or be is eliminated, so is the other; we can have a coupling
such that if a or b are both on a shelf, taking either off has no effect
on the other.

Then I may attempt to produce a metaphysics of such a system - or rather
to forestall the production of such a metaphysics, deconstructing the
framework of any metaphysics vis-a-vis the system. Or rather, I can argue
towards a metaphoricity of relationship (linkage, coupling, etc.), reify-
ing the terms and placing them within a matrix of parallelisms. Such a
metaphoricity can also be used to similarly deconstruct parallelisms.

But to _believe_ in such metaphoricities or metaphysics as _fundamental_
is also to create a work of astonishing coherency, the real beneath the
sign of relation and its deconstruction. For example, think of a _basic
property of things_ - that they are linked or coupled or decoupled. This
strategy tends towards one or another universal exegesis.

Instead, I see N(a,b) as particulate matter - for example, N(a,a) can be a
harbinger of substance if N implies augmentation such that N(a,a) =
N(a,a,a) and so forth. This is an _unfolding of the frame_ or the cinema-
tic real.

Just so, the simplest number system is to the base 1: 1, 11, 111, etc. -
and the most extravagant is to the base of an inaccessibly high number
such that every numerical representation is uniquely identified by a unary
ideogram, shades of Borges for example

These are all fragments of the imaginary - and it is _critical_ to under-
stand this; they are part-objects, imminent within the real of the subject
and never immanent; their transcendence lies in the inauthenticity of
their simplicity, as if they were fundamental. Here is where the astonish-
ing work of coherency comes into play: consider that they are _not_ funda-
mental, that on the level of the life-world, _almost_ all the way up or
down, there is no fundamentality at all: as if the grounds of the real
themselves were decoupled "for all practical purposes."

Suppose for example, the complexity of the universe all the way down, dri-
ven by higher and higher energies, resulting in more and more basic parti-
cles: One might well say that the complexity of the universe is the direct
result of the energy used to examine it. As a corollary, from Brillouin to
some extent: the complexity of the universe is then in direct proportion
to the capital (economic/industrial/theoretical) used in such an examina-
tion. In such a manner, the _order_ of the world is in direct relation to
the social organization and its surplus, of a given civilization.

One may talk of the mirroring of the world, and note again the apparent
increasingly complexity of the mathematics and mathesis required in the
ongoing progress and investigation of the physics of the real, on _any_
level from the sub-particle to the overall cosmos, and their conjoining.

To retreat to the binary is to conjure the dream of rendering the literal
book of nature accessible - to create a stasis in modelling in the midst
of universal transformation. One might speak again of Foucault's _divina-
tio,_ a dream of a book of nature, augmented by a dream of universal rea-
son.

On the other hand, such a retreat is also the catalyst for a major publi-
cation; the real is revealed in all its coherency, and the world-system,
as reproduced, is an occasion for both foreclosing and framework - now,
not only of a and b, but also of a scope expanded to fulfill the promise,
virtue, and style of the world. This is a wonder, and I oscillate between
hope for a primal leverage, absolute signifiers (which also seem of nec-
essity to be restatements of universal law on the level of micro-physics),
and a dull recognition of the increasing fragmentation of the life-worlds
on the planet - almost as if the world were nothing more than Markov-
chains of shorter and shorter length.

The specifics of the leverage would not matter - just as the details of
universal equations spell out varying phenomenologies, but their very
transcendence is a symptom of overt organization, and deity for some. The
universal cosmic phenomenon of peering into the past (objects so distant
that it may take a billion years for light to reach us, objects otherwise
ungraspable) may be taken to imply radical disconnects, signals from what
appear to be disconsolate objects, expiring objects, objects at a loss in
relation to the human flicker on earth. And radical disconnects fragment
our own relation to the real as well; hence, the imaginary or that proble-
matic which resists symbolization. Connect such symbolization vis-a-vis
metaphor with the body (Lakoff), and "graspable" becomes, itself, a rela-
tion between model and modeller: Our world is deeply ungraspable, our im-
ages universally mediated, determined at least in part by economics, ener-
gies, and the exigencies of the viewing apparati themselves.

We are left with a partial _log_ of a continuous conversation, replete
with expanding knowledges, finer and finer tolerances - but a conversation
nonetheless, of fragments, micro-exhaustions (Stent's analyses of the
field of trignometry for example), and increasingly complex equations or
metaphysics. Driven by energy and economics, there is no end in sight;
what may eventually stare back at us through scientific exploration is
ourselves, our machinery. Heisenberg was only the first crack in the mir-
ror in this literal regard; what is impossible in fine-tuning position and
momentum is also metaphor for the fine-tuning of existence itself. For it
is not unreasonable to assume that higher energies propose newer partic-
les, linked in groupings, the end nowhere in sight. As far as binary oper-
ations per se, they remain within the imaginary of the dream and the dream
of the imaginary; they hold us in our fundamentally Aristotelian world, in
which the laws of distribution hold, and within which we may fall in love,
throw a ball, or speak, as if difference were upheld, or shattered.

October 7, 1999

EDITORIAL: THE REAL OBSCENITY

There's a public museum in New York that features a breathtakingly
offensive piece of "art." It's the American Museum of Natural History. To
enter the museum, you must walk by a huge statue of Theodore Roosevelt
armed and on horseback, towering above--vanquishing--a Native person and
an African person.

Has Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ever said the museum should lose public funding
because of this horrible, shockingly racist statue? Of course not. "Art"
that celebrates imperialism and colonialism is right up his alley.

But when an artist of African heritage depicts a Christian religious
figure in an unconventional way--with a clearly non-European face and
partly composed of materials rich in African cultural references--Giuliani
blows his stack. The mayor believes this piece is an affront to his
religion.

Reason enough, in Giulianiville, for the city to pull $27 million in
funding from the Brooklyn Museum of Art. The piece, "The Holy Virgin Mary"
by African-British (and Catholic) artist Chris Ofili, is part of the
exhibit "Sensation" set to open Oct. 2 at the museum.

The actual affront here is Giuliani's racist, fascist-like assault on
artistic freedom. It smacks of Hitlerism. It must not be allowed--in New
York, of all places. New York is not only an international center of the
arts. It is a multinational city--enlivened every day by the varied,
vibrant cultural expressions that emanate from hundreds of different
communities.

It's no accident that Giuliani is targeting the Brooklyn Museum. The
second-big gest art museum in the entire country, it is in the heart of
Brooklyn's Black community.  In the recent period, it has more and more
featured artists of color, along with educational programs designed for
the children of the community. Its permanent collections focus on the arts
of Africa and Asia. In October, its "First Saturday" program of arts and
entertainment will feature hip-hop/jazz/reggae artist Jeni Fujita,
Hawaiian band the Haoles, and a performance by the Mohawk Singers and
Dancers.

Giuliani's effort to quash the Brooklyn Museum exhibit is part of a
broader attack on freedom of expression for any but those favored by the
white, moneyed philistines who rule in this capitalist society. It is
allied with the ongoing national offensive to block federal funding for
programs that feature artists or art that's unacceptable to the right
wing, which mostly means art by or about people of color, lesbians and
gays, women.

Yet the mayor claims that blocking funding for the museum does not
infringe on the First Amendment right to freedom of expression. This just
goes to show how the capitalist establishment will twist its own laws,
turn its own Constitution inside out in the interests of its broader
political or ideological goals. When Giuliani doesn't like art, he says
the city doesn't have to fund it. When he doesn't like political views--
as with the Million Youth March, or the annual October march against
police brutality- -he tries to ban them, arguing that the city doesn't
have to provide the sidewalks or pay for traffic control, etc. They can
show their art in private galleries, he says. Let them give speeches
against the police at their own meetings, he says.

Actually, it is precisely public space for free expression that the First
Amendment supposedly does protect. And that of course includes public
funding. Interestingly enough, government officials regularly make this
exact argument when the politics in question are on the other side:
Whenever the Klan or the Nazis announce their intent to march, mayors and
police officials scramble to protect their "freedom of speech." They clear
public spaces for them, provide government vehicles for them to ride in,
and so on. Giuliani is no exception; when an ultra-reactionary group
recently staged an anti-gay picket outside the Stonewall bar in lower
Manhattan, his police protected the bigots and whisked them away in city
vehicles when they were done.

So the Constitution protects freedom of expression when the ruling class
sanctions what's being expressed. Anything else comes up against the might
of the State.

Giuliani's racist war against the Brooklyn Museum is of a piece with his
overall program--more police and rising police brutality, dumping
impoverished women off welfare and forcing them into slave-labor workfare,
shutting city hospitals, cutting funding for AIDS programs, selling off
city services to private contractors. In fact, one purpose of his art
attack is to divert mass anger away from all this.

It won't work. At the Oct. 1 demonstration to defend the Brooklyn Museum,
and beyond, let's build the struggle against Giuliani's attack. Let his
Nazi-style offensive come up against the might of the masses--which one
day, not too far away, will also topple Teddy Roosevelt from his
imperialist perch.

I always find myself going to the last page, probably the habit of reading
prayer books from right to left--but I'd prefer that others think that it's
because I can only fully possess the book and have a right to shelve it if
I've felt the heft of pages right to left and left to right.

Just an afterthought, but am I the only one who cares about the smell and
feel of the pages when I decide to add a book to my collection?  Before I
retired as an acquisitions librarian/cataloger in a public library, I had
written several letters to Farrar, S & G about their cheap bindings (I
didn't have the nerve to tell them they didn't smell that good either!)
considering that they published many fine novels.  I got answers from
various clerks to the effect that they would certainly take my comments into
consideration.

If there were an award for the books with the finest texture and smell for
the price, Sun and Moon would rank high.

A hypothesis: most people read more or less selectively, randomly. Reading
straight through a book carries a special connotation of professional
literary criticism and/or  respect for the
author's intentions--if one is reviewing a book, for example, it might be
felt necessary to do at least one straight through reading--as opposed to
reading"for oneself." It seems to me that even if one skips around, one
still has a sense of where a poem stands in the collection as a whole,
e.g. this is the last poem, the first poem, the last poem of the first
section. Thus the order is not disregarded or disrespected, simply not
followed.

Has anyone noticed the preponderance of last names ending in N among
Watergate Conspirators--Nixon, John Dean, Erlichman, Haldemann... it's
eerie.  Or could it be that N is simply one of the highest frequency
letters in English and German, the languages of origins of many surnames
in the US? All the more so since so many names end in the patronymic -son
or -sen. Nahh, it's got to have more meaning than this...

"politics of.."         (?)



this stuff, i'm good at putting it out of my mind for reasonably long
periods  -----  it's like philosophy, right ?  "that's why   i love phil
osophy   no one wins" [so cage says suzuki said] and as such it's not the
solving but the wondering about it  ------  i've been told that my interest
in this is anachronistic, that younger poets today see no meaningful
distinction  ----- curious, at least, i find that curious, or maybe i find
it untrue, i think that might be more to the point of my feeling as when i
talk to poets about things which seem "content-specific" and/or
"form-specific" the way the answers come suggests that i'm not asking about
the same ~thing~  ------  another poet told me that i was "stuck back there"
(meaning.. the 50s? 60s?..?) this was in response to my interest in writers
like cage, antin, etc  ------ the suggested tonic was a bracing read of
bruce andrews' critical work  ------ so i read some, that is i read some
*again*  ------  it didnt really change anything, i found it as eloquent as
it had been and ultimately perhaps less convincing

where am i going with this ?  (form as ramble, content as...)


i'm not sure ---- but there are a few things that come to mind which might
lead somewhere

having read any number of arguments about the political *import* of form i'd
like to either confess or assert my skepticism -----  confess, if it turns
out that someone is able to show me why i should be convinced (that is, i'm
not unwilling to be convinced, i'm just not) and ------ assert, if it should
turn out that i remain unconvinced that "form" has anything other than
extremely limited political implications
        now i realize there are many who will immediately want to dispute
and or support this notion  -----  but if i can, if it matters that i try
to, suggest, that before any of us stake ourselves on the question or before
we post something ringing here on the list, that whomever wishes to wave
whatever flag or just offer their 2 cents try to deal with the semantic
questions ----- what you take the two term's ~use~ to be, or what they
~mean~ or however you prefer to approach it  (i've nothing against "meaning"
so, on my account at least, no one need worry that i'll quibble at that
----- tho i will certainly ask questions if i don't "get" yr meaning)


there is an interview with david antin, from vort ?  i cant recall right
now, but in it he talks briefly about his consideration of this question and
of an experience wherein the more he thought about it the less form meant
and the more all the things that had been called ~form~ seemed clearly (to
him) to be "content"  ---  i apologize for not having this handy to quote,
but i think that that was the gist, a sort of ah-ha situation wherein
repeated tests for "form" kept turning up "content" until it seemed safe to
conclude that form was nowhere
        now i mention this as something rather similar happened to me but on
the other end of the see-saw  ------  content didn't "disappear" per se, but
it didnt seem conceivable without form whereas (i told myself at that time)
form did  ----  rather form seemed "abstractable" in the sense that one can
have an idea of the form of a pyramid without it being a pyramid whose
content was bricks or glass or marshmallows or whatever and i read this
prescindability of form from content but not content from form as indication
of it being, more.. essential ?  more foundational ?  i dunno (my opinion
hasnt stayed with this formulation)

more recently antin writes;
        About form -- The word almost always from its origins suggests
configuration, shape, outline and almost always drags that origin behind it.
It even drags that along in Cage's definition Composition as Process, where
he defines it as "the morphology of the continuity", which is nothing more
than a longwinded way to say shape and include within this notion the
sequence of shifts moving from beginning to end.  When someone says "sonata
form"  he/she is providing an outline of the sequence of actions seemingly
required by the genre. I find this kind of commentary mostly trivial.  My
sense of structure is of something more profound -- it is a notion of the
organization of function.  The two can be seen to overlap in some uses. When
one speaks of the shape of an arrow, one is also speaking in part of its
structure because the shape plus its materiality are what allow it to
perform its action of penetration (.and perhaps resistance to removal). When
you speak of rhyme, you're speaking of one of the structural properties of
some kind of verbal work -- a particular form of (usually arbitrary)
phonologic repetition --. The alliteration (consonantal rhyme) of Anglo
Saxon poetry is similarly a structural feature, combined with the pausal
break it has to bridge (Germanic caesura) and with certain notions of
formulaic appositional phrasing. Dante's terza rima is similarly structural,
it is not formal.  That is to say the discourse has to pass through the
micro-organization of the rhyme scheme; this is part of its dynamic but it
says nothing about the overall shape of the poem.  As far as the terza rima
is concerned, it could have propelled a very short poem or a very long one.
But the principle of interlocked successive phrases has a real significance
for that work that can be neutralized by the descriptive or narrative
structure, emphasized or muted. Still, rhyme hasnt been an interesting
structural principle in a long time, except in pop songs.  In neo-formalist
verse it mainly plays the role of declaring a kind of propriety  -- like
wearing a tie and would probably work better if it was more like wearing
spats.  But more seriously -- if you look at a painting by Barney Newman, a
discussion of the form is ridiculous.  There is a sea of color broken by a
fissure that can be seen as erupting from beneath it like magma rising from
an ocean floor or like light breaking through a chromatic cloud.  The
placement and choice of the fissure matters but it's not a formal mattering,
it's a dynamic mattering.  In some of the works, it isn't entirely obvious
whether these "stripes" emerge from below the field or whether the field
lies beneath them and is threatening or promising to engulf them.   There is
no overall form.  There is a tension between the elements that Newman was
working with.  And of course, the reason that these paintings matter has to
do with the cultural history and consequent psychological history of paint
and color.  I could sketch out a similar though different dynamic for
Rothko, or Pollock or De Kooning. These art works are not formally
organized.  There is a structural dynamic that plays itself out.  I could
lay out a structural dynamic of a very different sort for pop-artists like
Lichtenstein or Warhol.  And they both employ the most obvious and banal
examples of commercial design (form in its most trivial sense), but the use
is ironical, and their structure is not based on issues of painting but on
issues of representation and illustration.  I could go on, but the question
is hardly worth beating to death.



and this i dug in that he's insisting on there being overtones to "form"
that aren't useful or meaningful for him and instead talking about these
things as "structure" or the "organization of function" ---- that is, i like
the distinction, but i've heard plenty of folks ~use~ form in this way, as a
dynamic rather than static "shape-like" principle

anyway



i came upon an old issue of boundary 2, a special issue on creeley
[spring/fall 78] and in the lengthy interview with william spanos rc talks
about his sense of form and content, it goes like this (i've tried as best i
can to preserve the look of the text which isn't justified and which looks
very much like one of antin's talk poems does on the page save that it uses
punctuation);

spanos: ...but i'm uncertain whether or not most people who    read yours
and olson's poetry really understand it    "form     is never more     than
an extension of content."  ( . . . )

creeley: see    the dilemma there    as i gather over the years  is
pretty precisely    in the word      "content."  ( . . . ) because for many
people   the word "content"     implies and/or states       sort of mental
furniture   ( . . . )   i really felt      however vaguely at that point
that it wasn't content    it was what was in the actual system that could
manifest   "itself"   by whatever form    was possible.   I mean   the thing
that i    even then    most insistently used as example    was the
circumstance     that happens    let's say    what happens when you take a
glass of water     and just dump it on the floor?      the fact of water
the content  inherently of water    discovers a form   a form specific to
its    "nature"   to put it loosely   on the surface   it meets with.   no
~idea~ of water will change that    situation   so to speak.     and ~that~
was the sense of content i         like murder will out i suppose    is what
i was mostly thinking of     the nature of murder as an act will discover
itself     not because anyone thinks or wants it to be that way    but
because   ~per se~   it ~is~   that way
(p.22-23)

and this is interesting to me --- i follow it and think i'm getting it and
then i think about it again and it starts to look more and more puzzling to
me ---- it seems to suggest no "intent" that the content should find any
form in particular but an acceptance that it will find one of necessity and
that this will be it's form the splash it's content makes coming into being

but then consider this from "Notebook, January 31 - April 3, 1977";

    Form seems to begin with possibility (human), ends with habit
(information stabilized). I use threes and fours in poems just as I might
use two by fours and right angled 'corners'  --  they 'do' something in each
case. Stones and bricks, or, more accurately, a rounding surface as against
a four-square one.  Threes fall forward, fours sit.  And can, incidentally,
'stop' anywhere -- whereas threes must come to a 'balance.'  (same volume
p.78)

        ~what?~

i mean, well, i think that this is very interesting too right ? but it feels
very odd next to the other quote and makes me feel increasingly like i don't
have much grip on creeley's understanding of the terms form and content at
all --- am i to assume that what he knows about "threes and fours" is due
simply to a lot of experience splashing content out there and finding that
it lands in threes and fours ?  am i truly to believe that some of his
longer poems that are so resolutely in quatrains, have no intent, no impulse
to ~quartrainicity~ ?

this isnt meant as criticism of creeley but offered up in hopes that for
someone else it will be very clear and that they might enlighten me (us?)
about it

i say that

but at the same time i think that form/content is something of a koan (kent
johnson suggested this to me a year or more ago)  for poets --- good, on
account of insolubility, for asking what the fuck one actually does mean by
some statement or another

the end of blank pages, the freedom of outpouring, who needs happiness? I'm

most vapid manner (which I have practiced). soon, a road appears. friends,
this is a strange world that I see before me. I forthwith run, dance, tumble
along, always with a sense that forward is a direction, and I am going that
way. this may not work for all. it may not even be true, but don't let that
be a barrier. just follow the implication.

okay, I fooled you all, I was having you on. simplicity works for me. I sit
at the writing machine and wait for my turn. when my turn arrives, I think
of arctic terns that migrate from one end of this globe to the other,
valiantly, dutifully, and for highly mysterious reasons. it's a great image,
and the words pour forth.

fooled you again, actually. I'm not about images. I have words, plain words,
to deal with, before they deal with me. and so, on an afternoon when I have
the freedom, specifically at 3:02, as I look at this watch I was given, I
place fingers to keyboard, listening to a musical rendition of a song "Who
Do You Love", a song that truly exists, for you possibly as well as for me.
sometimes it exists played at breakneck speed, all the better. and so:
words, effort, thinking, and lost (loss) and found. and mud, the celebration
of earth and water. anyway, thank you for your interest, the world is not
always kind.

The rally is over, at least for today. It was great to see a functioning
multicultural coalition, ranging from Rev. Docherty to Norman Siegal, and
from Susan Sarandon to Jane Alexander. Judy Blume, Dred Scott, and a num-
ber of other speakers were incredibly eloquent. I think the crowd was pro-
bably about 2000; it was much larger than expected.

Some of the points: Recent Supreme Court decisions have indicated that a
government cannot withold funding for _specific_ shows; it can only refuse
funding basically as a matter of policy. If Giuliani gets away with this,
the city libraries can be next, since they're also supported by city funds
and have works which are anti-religious, obscene, etc. within them. Why do
we have to fight the same tired battles over and over again, every decade?
Meanwhile Giuliani is in California raising money for the Senate race. And
this battle is _not_ just local and isn't just about censorship; it's also
about the increasing right-wing clampdown on this country.

Where were you? If you are in New York, please get involved with this and
other issues - police brutality for example. (I must say, as did the org-
anizers, that the 78 Precinct, which is also mine, was terrific.) You can
get more information by going to New York Civil Liberties Union website at
http://www.nyuclu.org There are gonig to be more protests; there is a
vigil at the museum tomorrow (Saturday) night at 8:45-9:00.

Please do what you can. We have a great deal to fear in the next elections
- Senator Giuliani, President Bush, and a Republican right-wing Congress.
Whatever party you belong to, don't stand for this sort of censorship.

Alan

Limbs extending outward from. These eyes are your eyes, not mine?
Subliminal does not sublimation account, the totality of ambiguous
minions, three-pronged intervention in complacency & the next best

Broach desire & concede. How many probabilties open, numerous,
random facination in the ragweed forest, a jungle of planatation. ex-

in collusion with the conspiracy to untitle. Doctor of manifestation
appears humble, bold, surrounded in a once that defies a quiet moment
when we can meet in between.

"Mine are minor." Restitution based on appropriated meanings that are
sly or otherwise witty. Such a gaunt caricature, the rings around the
eyes, I wonder why I even got up in the morning when the internet is
embodied all night. A simple way to say this is. She fell toward
grace, but only as an act of fruition, seven shiny apples in a window.
My transparency is vibrant, but not hungry.

Singularity is common even among disagreement. Parataxis is definitely
not 2 taxis bound for collision, otherwise I would dispair & ask for a
ride. Given the ability of all subtexts to degenerate I am seeking
concordances among those Ive never met, as if to touch untouchables.

The ultimatum pinpoints the absolute molecule of Grace. Stories before,
in a coded land only a tinge of spell awoke the peacekeepers. A 1000

gnosis. Provocation by characters not provided for in the story sketch,
aware of their fictive limits, stretched amid awe. The sanction to write
declared hereby polyvocal, simultaneous & considered, but as usual,
somewhere the text always reduces to the -emes between words. One
net commandeered another, you so lonely there in siber s p a c e.

i didnt edit myself terribly well in that long form/content posting

i wrote of antin's long passage; "and this i dug in that he's insisting on
there being overtones to "form" that aren't useful or meaningful for him and
instead talking about these things as "structure" or the "organization of
function" ---- that is, i like
the distinction, but i've heard plenty of folks ~use~ form in this way, as a
dynamic rather than static "shape-like" principle"

and that's a bit muddled --- the distinction, maybe much the same that olson
and creeley were after (?) --- seems to be between "form" as static
statement of shape or enumeration of requisites in the way that one cd for a
sonnet say that, at least, it needed 14 lines (even this isnt crucial
perhaps, but for the sake of this discussion...) ---- antin sees "form" as
being primarily bound up with these sorts of considerations and his interest
is in ~other~ things (which is what isnt quite clear in my original posting)
having to do with the organization of function within the structure of the
the art work (be it poetry, painting, whatever)

that was probably clear to most, but in case i bungled it for anyone thru my
inexactitude...

In INDIANA it was recently VOTED that ALL RAILROAD TRAINS and ALL
TELEPHONE POLES and SOME BUILDINGS will be PLACED ON THEIR SIDES
permanently. Thus the TRAINS have their WHEELS by convention on
THEIR RIGHT-HAND-SIDE, against thin RAILS held VERTICALLY into
PLACE. Furthermore, SMALL CARRIAGES POSSESSING WHEELS are permit-
ted BENEATH THE SIDEWAYS CARS AND ENGINES to enable them to MOVE
ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE in SUCH A CONDITION.

THE SAME does NOT hold true for ALL BUILDINGS but SOME BUILDINGS,
which, on their SIDE, may have BOTH WINDOWS AND DOORS OPENING IN-
TO THE EARTH BELOW, as well as OTHER WINDOWS AND DOORS OPENING
ONTO THE SKY ABOVE, as well as STILL OTHER WINDOWS AND DOORS OP-
EN ON TWO SIDES for EASY EGRESS AND EXIT, as well as ENTRANCE.

As for the TELEPHONE POLES, ALL OF WHICH are ON THEIR SIDES,
there should be PLACED UPON THEM, WARNINGS FOR CHLDREN, AGAINST
the TOUCHING of such wires AS THEY NOW CARRY, EASILY LAID UPON
THE EARTH.

Outtages MAY OCCUR.

Lipstick? Eleven?
-or-
What the hell is the name of that magazine anyway?

Let me hereby settle the arguments, family feuds, and bets I know you've
been placing:
The name of the magazine is Lipstick Eleven.

As Tisa Bryant so astutely pointed out at tonight's Small Press Traffic
Soiree in San Francisco, there is a "No. 1" printed on the spine of our
first issue. Soon there will be a "No. 2'" and then after that "No. 3" etc.
but it will always be Eleven, which means of course that there will one day
be a Lipstick Eleven 11, and won't we all cry for joy then? (I know I will).

Warning: This is an eyewitness, first-person account and therefore
inherently unreliable.

I attended the SPT soiree at New College in San Francisco this evening. (It
was nearly an all-day affair.) I arrived a few minutes after 6:00 p.m. to
assume my shift as door greeter/ticket taker-seller gal. My role was to take
people's money and when they asked me questions, to immediately repeat the
question in their presence to someone who might actually know the answer to
the question.

I was involved in a spirited conversation with giovanni singleton and Peter
Neufeld, Nick from SPT, and later Mary Margaret Sloan, and I was soon
"shushed": you know, "can you keep it down for god's sake there's an auction
going on next door" and apparently you need a lot of quiet for an auction.

I know because I held in my very own hand the tuft from the left side of
Samuel Delany's 11-year-old beard (with a personal affidavit signed by
Delany himself) which Taylor Brady secured at the SPT auction -- and you
don't want someone outbidding you on something like that because you can't
hear! I mean, it would be really heartbreaking. (You go Taylor boy.)

Later, Kevin Killian's play "Three On a Match" was staged to the enjoyment
of all. I simply can't list here all the amazing performances, but will
highlight the aforementioned Sloan's hilarious performance as a thwarted
Olympic figure skater come murderer. I think she missed a calling, or maybe
she is finding one now. Everyone did a very fine job, and then the local
band "Plain" played and these guys are really talented -- all of them also
appeared in Kevin's play.

Then I carried off the raffle prizes which loads of people from my office
won (while I won nothing!) because Doug Powell, who works at the same
company as me, sold loads of tickets at work. Good job! And I'm sure I will
get the prizes to those who really won them, uh, right away . . .

Congratulations to everyone who worked hard to plan and execute the soiree,
and I hope it brought in loads of cash for SPT.

Hugs & Kisses,
Kathy Lou

Until my retirement I was an acquisitions librarian for a public library,
and I was often gently teased for subverting the collection with too many
poetry books.  Among these books were many "how-to" books for a general
audience and some books that were probably designed as texts for high-school
and college creative writing courses.

I was pleasantly surprised recently to come across the book, "Poetry Writing
: Theme and Variations," by David Starkey, NTC/Contemporary Publishing
Group, c2000.  Each brief chapter presents models of types of poems,
discusses them, and asks the student to try writing that type of poem.  Now
to what I found unique:  Chapter 40, Rearranging Memory, presents three
poems, one by Lyn Hejinian and the others by students.
Still another chapter, Playful Piracy, includes a poem by Charles Bernstein
in which lines by Swinburne are rearranged.  John Cage is represented in a
chapter on puzzle poems.  I don't have the expertise to evaluate the text,
but I thought that the book might be worth looking at given its attempt to
present alternatives.

The rest of the text is pretty much occupied by "the usual suspects," many
of whom are, nevertheless, favorites of mine.

Hope this is of interest to someone.

After a month-long hiatus, the WriteNet poet interview series is back.
This month, Ann Lauterbach reads her poem "On (Open)" from her book _On A
Stair_, and talks about poetry as magic and the fragmented nature of
experience.

To read the interview, go to

Also, if you have been enjoying these series, I'd really appreciate it if
you could "spread the word" as it were and let people outside the poetics
list know about it. Thanks.

Call for Papers

The Opening of the Field: A Conference on
North American Poetry in the 1960s

University of Maine
Orono, Maine
June 28-July 2, 2000


The National Poetry Foundation invites paper and panel proposals for a
conference on North American poetry of the 1960s.  Proposals are welcome on
writers of previous generations whose literary careers extended into the
1960s, such as Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen, Robert Lowell, Charles Olson,
Anne Sexton, Elizabeth Bishop, Lorine Niedecker, etc.; on poets of literary
movements that climaxed in the 1960s, including the Beat, Black Mountain,
San Francisco Renaissance, and New York schools; on women poets and poets
of color, who began to speak with a new confidence during this decade; and
on new literary moments that began to define themselves in this period,
such as the ethnopoetic movement and language-centered writing.  Papers are
also invited on the general cultural background of the period, including
such themes as the tensions between "academic" poetry and various attempts
to bring poetry into the lives of people "in the streets"; the relationship
of poetry and popular culture, including rock music; and the role of poetry
in the anti-war movement.  As the title of the conference suggests, we
invite proposals on Canadian as well as on American poetry in the 1960s.

The conference will begin on Wednesday evening, June 28, and will conclude
shortly after noon on Sunday, July 2. Accommodations and meals will be
available at a reasonable rate in university residence halls. Registration
will be $85, with a reduced rate of $60 for graduate students.

Confirmed participants as of October 1, 1999, include Marjorie Perloff,
Michael Davidson, Joan Retallack, Lorenzo Thomas, Rosmarie Waldrop, Keith
Waldrop, Maria Damon, Barrett Watten, Lynn Keller, Peter Middleton, and Ron
Silliman.

Subject:      re revolving doors
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

the poem "Revolving Door" with which my selected, _Desire_,(1988), opens,
was written in 1961* and was first published in a book, _The Gathering_ ,
in 1965. It was published again in an early selected, _Ten Years in the
Making_ , in 1973. There are slight differences between the earlier
verions, and the 1987 version.

* the table of contents of _10 years_ states that this poem was written in
1964. I believe this to be incorrect; I must have meant re-written. I have
a clear recollection of writing this poem before I left Vancouver (1962),
and of its being published thenaobuts in a magazine...but which, I can't
recall.

The term "revolving door" (hired n fired, biz world), was not in use in
those years. It is not a linguistic resource then, so much as a
3-dimensional one, that prompts it : the actual object in the 4th dimension
of time.

Whether Ron derived it from my work strikes me as moot. There are revolving
doors everywhere, plus which I believe by the time of _Ketjak_ 's being
written, the biz term had currency. That notwithstanding, I have always
been encouraged by this rime between Ron's quite different writing, and
mine. .

Subject:      Re: View from the front: The Small Press Traffic soiree

Kathy,

I believe it was Ms. Tanya Hollis who scored the snip of Chip's beard....
I remember being shocked and delighted that she bid on something described as
being for fetishists....maybe they'll share, or (gasp!) maybe it is Tanya who's
the beard for Taylor's bent....hmmm.

Tisa


<pre>
Warning: This is an eyewitness, first-person account and therefore
inherently unreliable.

I attended the SPT soiree at New College in San Francisco this evening. (It
was nearly an all-day affair.) I arrived a few minutes after 6:00 p.m. to
assume my shift as door greeter/ticket taker-seller gal. My role was to take
people's money and when they asked me questions, to immediately repeat the
question in their presence to someone who might actually know the answer to
the question.

I was involved in a spirited conversation with giovanni singleton and Peter
Neufeld, Nick from SPT, and later Mary Margaret Sloan, and I was soon
"shushed": you know, "can you keep it down for god's sake there's an auction
going on next door" and apparently you need a lot of quiet for an auction.

I know because I held in my very own hand the tuft from the left side of
Samuel Delany's 11-year-old beard (with a personal affidavit signed by
Delany himself) which Taylor Brady secured at the SPT auction -- and you
don't want someone outbidding you on something like that because you can't
hear! I mean, it would be really heartbreaking. (You go Taylor boy.)

Later, Kevin Killian's play "Three On a Match" was staged to the enjoyment
of all. I simply can't list here all the amazing performances, but will
highlight the aforementioned Sloan's hilarious performance as a thwarted
Olympic figure skater come murderer. I think she missed a calling, or maybe
she is finding one now. Everyone did a very fine job, and then the local
band "Plain" played and these guys are really talented -- all of them also
appeared in Kevin's play.

Then I carried off the raffle prizes which loads of people from my office
won (while I won nothing!) because Doug Powell, who works at the same
company as me, sold loads of tickets at work. Good job! And I'm sure I will
get the prizes to those who really won them, uh, right away . . .

Congratulations to everyone who worked hard to plan and execute the soiree,
and I hope it brought in loads of cash for SPT.

Hugs & Kisses,
Kathy Lou

_Postmodernism, Or..._) on Perelman's poem "China." Or, of critiques of
Jameson

help backch or frontch appreciated.

Just a note to say that last week in Stockholm I found a new publication
called OED: Oidentifierade verbala objekt, which includes translations of
Charles Bernstein's Artifice essay, his A Defence of Poetry, an extract from
Perloff's Radical Artifice, poetry by Hannah Weiner, together with other
stuff (by Rosmarie Waldrop,Julien Blaine, Emmanuel Hocquard, Pierre
Alferi, etc). Finally something's cooking up here. If anyone's intersted
their address is OEI, Box 311 20, 400 32 Göteborg (Gothenburg), Sweden.

The text is (should be) that uninhibited person,
non-site): anachronic subject, adrift

At least some examples?
of an epoch, of a character?
word for word?
denote a class notion?
another edge, mobile, bleak?
the institutions of text?
but the opposite?
doesn't every narrative lead to Oedipus?
an anagram of the body?
my reader's pleasure?
the sentence is a body?
all this verbal display?
the very materiality of that once existed?
how can we read criticism?
boredom of all narratives?

such are the hardships everywhere in the garden your sweat the divine
shaman by the corner beneath dawn those whirring walls of the festival
the hill talks of nonsense let the rain take off and village ditties are
here busy at raising silkworms in the field picking melons this crooked
road your upset clings to my gown on and on over the jumbled hills
Buddha is everything rejoice in the slanting flowers for what you are is
the creatures of creation halfway up the mountain facing scars from
former years this crooked road sorrow is blown by a flute and Buddha is
everything don't mistake the wasted days twisting in the azure air
opposite me turn towards you for I fear at random so loving their fall
so loving their fall hundreds cannot tell the deep-hidden dotted the
peach-paths ashamed that the traveler has got enough for you to get
drunk still wrapped in private gauze for her dress a shivering drink
before going home so its fertilty will reimburse you and the little one

Was it an empty dream?

Moon meant that he would be waiting
that love & lust inspire in men

He was now growing far too fond of her
such delicacy blooming in the thicket

snow had fallen heavily and piled up
the days went by, were no longer mine to control

I'll kill you for your pains
foreheads who must be peeping with interest
floating along thinking of their own inevitable end

nobody could hear your nonsense
wretched though the place looks

much stock in the words of the diviner
but would desire to converse with such a woman
engender frivilous thoughts
while I sat in a meditation hall
everything is dust & reflected in the pond
I gathered all the priests with my own hand
he could not deny the blind intoxicating pleasure

I was startled & scurried for shelter
but we can forget our misery
nervously I could not keep back my tears

Roland Barthes, grief@ruthless.sexuality

the more ravaging term
the perhaps the subject
concerned with destruction
grasps at every point
but quickly exposes itself
we are all caught up in the truth
the leisure of bygone readings
where we can hear the grain of the throat
whenever I attempt
without ever introducing anything
the very utterance
the other reading skips nothing
psychoanalysis must be traversed
but it is doubtless
violence must be coded
if it were possible to imagine
we have either the course
outside bliss but not necessarily
deplored except
like a bird who understand nothing
only in total atopia


Vagina Dentata, writer@bloodbath.typewriter

Since we halved the hairpin

Young travelers coming here

I wipe my tears

Obliterated and buried

Why should one care?

Writhing upwards

Belongs to another time

Ten thousand noises die down

I recall those years

My shadow falls at random

I've known the tramp

I'll never fall behind

Choked by feeling

Bells ring in evening sky

My sorrow resembles

Family stripped clean

This charming beauty

Keep pace with ambition

Share a farewell cup

In a frozen land

On her new robe

Whip tucked in her sleeve

And showers affection as if

We must beg for poverty

Not too much wine

When he wakes up

Do we ever wake

Who brings war

I'm tired of poetry


daphne mezereum, song@form.meant

In both of the insertions of poetic text that for greater sonority,
inspite of its name, magic bullets which never miss their mark, thru a
pact with the spirits of hell, such as observance of enharmonic
equivalents, executed by a leading couple, a sign indicating awe of
nature near the end of life. a great flowering of songs to listen
intelligently to has a considerable wider device to dampen sound, to
change the best-known janizary music associated with famous clowns,
often in service of the story. who wishes to marry a long contorted
technique throughout. the contours of a forest anticipates the music
after a period of captivity. optional dances on which a swan swims
majestically is borrowed from a nearby mesmorizing rule. accidental
music appeared to be exuberant melancholy.

Lost Japan
Japan New and Old
Bygone Days in Old Japan
Japan, A Glimpse into the Past

Japan - Signs - immersed - floor-level, the turning - slates of peoples -
targeting and inverted - decathecting in the bushido zone - looking in
towards interior perfections - closed faces and facades - operatives of
the _brush-stroke_ - if the point/node characterizes the west, the line
characterizes japan - kami linkages - the darkness of the city in my for-
eign night - detailing and intervaling, spacings - mono no aware - wabi
and sabi - the interior forlorn -

Japan, Land of Many Contrasts
Mysterious Japan
Japan, from Geisha to Gaijin

signs determinative of signs, foreign to me, illegible, _watching_ signs
immersed in a world of signs
floor-level, the turning, flatness of spaces, turning everywhere
slates of peoples passing by, peripheral glances, blanked exteriors
targeting and inverted, out of the corner of their eyes, gaijin naked
decathecting in the bushido zone, detumescence, disconnected
looking in towards interior perfections, perfect family-life, burakumin
closed faces and facades, i was never there, lintels, portals
operatives of the brush-stroke, the inscription of the real
point and line, the view-given garden, turned and widening line
kami linkages, everywhere intensities, confabulations of millennia, ages
darkness of the city, gaijin bar to sidewalk to jinja to neon river, night
detailing, intervals and spaces, the ornamental flow, edge intensity
mono no aware, my last weeks, last night long walk past the zen temple
wabi and sabi, this body, moments of despair and worn sailings

In the Streets of Old Japan
Japan, Land of Cherry-Blossoms
Japan, Land of the Cherry-Blossom
Japanese Wonders and Beauties

on the night of the interior forlorn, i have never finished with japan,
it's an open wound, a space in consciousness, a flood, olden days in
japan, images impenetrable, the gulf absolute, the rupture, and division
of new and old, division of here and there

Arts and Crafts of Old Japan
Japan through the Eyes of Masterless Samurai
Japan, Land of the Rising Sun
The Japanese Miracle
The Japanese Experience
Art and Life in Old Japan
Japan Inside and Out

it's what i remember, every detail of the 7-11 store-shelves, walking be-
hind hakozaki shrine, details which reappear in dreams, the second-hand
shop on the corner and its shogi sets, more and more lists, the children
staring at me yelling back 'baka baka'

Ghosts and Tales in Old Japan
Japanese Hobgoblins
Tengu? No Thank you! In Old Japan
Japan through Sumo
Life and Loves of the Ancient Japanese
Oh! Japan!

i can't assimilate the transformation, the kanji disappeared, certain
paintings, glances, edges of things, always felt myself at odds with each
and every gaijin, o third country of the spirit, it's what i remember, i'm
dreadfully afraid of reconstitution, making it up as i go along, the
things themselves retreated into algorithms for reconstruction, right or
wrong, 'my japanese days,' 'my time in japan,' as well as more personal
material intertwined, inseparable, confusioned, contusion

Representation and Misrecognition in Old Japan
Multicultural Exegesis in Genji's Heian Japan
The Presuppositions of the Myth of Japanese Homogeneity

haunted with an incontrovertible knot set in my maw my brainstem my hole,
kabuki samurai misrecognitions, never made it to the theater, parks wet
with leaves, moats, stone stupas, my gaijin head smashed among them as i
leapt out of the country of noh truth as literal as possible

Dear Listers,

  I wanted to announce the quite curious fact that I have two (old) poems in
the new Poetry Desk Calendar 2000 (available at a mega-chain near you). Most
of the calendar days are occupied by dead people, so I'm somewhere between
Blake and (the dread) Joyce Kilmer. Needless to say, we're a pretty ecclectic
group!

It being nearly impossible for me to grow a beard myself, I've always held
the hirsute facial appendages enthralling in others. Thus the true motive
for my avowed "great pleasure" in introducing David Bromige during the group
reading at the same event. (Though, it's true, I have as much admiration for
his work as for his beard - and the same might be said of Delany). So mine
is a beardward bent that needs no beard for its bending.

Tanya, of course, has her own "bent" reasons to dig a translucent plastic
envelope full of hair...

I believe it was Ms. Tanya Hollis who scored the snip of Chip's beard....

        Maybe it's obvious to all, but if not, you will welcome the news
that Oidentifieriade verbala objekt is an unidentified verbal object,
presumably something that doesnt exist that everybody's read or heard of
(although isnt it rather, in this case, something that does exist that
nobody has seen or read of, in sweden that is, until now? leastwise in the
minds of the editors?). It must be quite clear to non-swedish readers,
except for the O, which has the function of un, but looks as though an
irish person had blundered into the act.  David

You Screw Ups, Wait Up!

the favourite toy releases the idea of generosity. merely being in that
presence, people look for the ice to melt. maybe it won't, these winters are
persistent. such is human devotion, even when the faces are wrong. still,
maybe generosity is exactly the thing that could uncage the exacting beast
needed for the situation. well first, accept that a situation exists.
thoroughly riveting dynamics tell us that a possible intercourse shows on
the map. maybe so, who bothers to look? just jump to the idea that something
's here. and it's just us, people of the neighbourhood. the neighbourhood
doesn't have all its elements in working order, but we can try with what we'
ve got. oh dear, that's a hopeful note, and hope is just one more hunk of
wood floating down stream. the point is the idea of generosity, and how
generosity could eradicate. well, what should it eradicate? what needs
rectifying, what needs changing? dilemmas are everywhere, binary exclusions.
try the door marked Generosity and see if anyone is there. because it's a
person who must carry it, Generosity doesn't fall with the rain. we can look
at the earth and all its whatever but, no, forget that, human is everything.
your process, my process, something concerted. it's chemistry, or the tale
of documentation, or a close kept secret molded for reasonable usage. what?
just more talk? the heroes determine the features of the show. the favourite
toy releases the idea of generosity. try the door marked Quickly. time has
bent itself into all sorts of shapes, whether you were aware or not. me, I'm
pretending to be noble so that Generosity (still drunk with power) will
stumble closer. it's a game of waiting and wandering and wearing the right
clothes. clean underwear or no underwear, as if this were a principle: who
cares, the map exists, the song is known, the facts are clear and Generosity
has the floor. believe it. or, you know, forget about it all, work another
territory. the work has been described, we don't need the experts telling us
more.

Welcomed Grant From Poetry Heaven

the process can be faked. likeliness fools many people. advice is just
another hazard in the road. Poetry has no point, and never scores a run.
never in possibility, only thrust to the bottom and left to accrue notions
from the most usual of places. anyone can make Poetry, it's a big trick. it'
s a scam, a racket, a deadbeat dad in Cayman Island hideaway sticking with
the coconuts and verisimilitudes. Poetry is the gunk you don't bother to
scrape from your shoes, and anyone can make it. it has the benefit of
filling in holes. it sings because the gun's jammed in the ribs. don't shoot
Poetry, we need it. kill me, not Poetry. Poetry has too much to offer.
Poetry has vision, and pieces of snakes and careerist oblations. Poetry is
from the stars and made for intense picnics. Poetry is political the same
way ice cream is, mean, inspired ice cream. Poetry has a piano with all the
words on it. Poetry can be made into lemons or frogs. Poetry is terrific
because people are terrific. Poetry is the sight of a crow and a farm in
famous New Delhi. you have to behave to write Poetry. everyone loves Poetry,
Poetry is the bomb. and when that bomb goes off, an entire tent will shimmer
in the breeze. oh, the beautiful breeze. a little girl will look up,
slightly amazed at Poetry's wonder machine. her friends think they see
something but, no, Poetry is fickle because Poetry has hopes. to play on a
nice team, with the right kids, in an okay town, Poetry has the thing
together. perhaps the little girl is not all that together. Poetry will
know. oh yes, Poetry will certainly suss the sitch.

I certainly had read every available book of David's before I wrote that
first phrase to Ketjak in 1974. However, I wrote that sentence in a small
cafe in SF across the street from the B of A world headquarters while
waiting to meet Rochelle Nameroff for lunch one day. There was a revolving
door on at least one of the entrances then (don't know about now).

I had also heard the west coast debut of Steve Reich's Drumming the night
before at the Asian Art Museum, and that use of reiteration was in my head,
literally ringing in my ears.

After reading the current Rain Taxi interview with Bei Dao, which
sent me back to his books of poetry, notably the latest,
Landscape Over Zero, I am more and more intrigued by this poet,
whom I once saw read in Paris several years ago.

Could someone direct me to published criticism or other interviews?
According to Rain Taxi, Bei Dao is teaching at the University of
California at Davis. I wonder if anyone has a more precise address?

Thanks,

oi object to that last remark. Though, while we're at it, listening to the
radio this afternoon I realised that paddies pronounce the words lawyer and
liar almost identically. (Add the o's yourselves, I'm on a go slow)

Sorry if this is too long. Please just delete it. But in four days I
think we had most of the readings for the year.

The readings began with one by Maxine Hong Kingston. It was packed.
Some guy in my dept, and several other people, have been complaining a
lot about Kingston coming to read (HLAC brought her). I've been
forgiving the way hlac is paying Kingston $500 to read (not much money;
she had a better paying, yet restricted, gig at the HCTE). Mainly b/c
I'm just like, well it is someone else reading (one step forward of my
hlac year). And it was what I expect of community arts
organizations--they like big names.

She read this piece from that Hawai'i book. I need to go and read it.
I'll probably get it wrong here. It was a chapter about the TAlk Story
conference (one of the first conferences on local lit in the 70s or
early 80s; Susan Schultz will know; something I obviously did not
attend). I
found it completely offensive (but I might be overreacting I should say
since I don't have the text and didn't take notes). It began with this
story of ladies lifting their skirts as they walked across the palace
grounds where Liliuokalani was interned (which someone pointed out she
miscalled the governor's palace). And then it goes on to do this reading
of the conference which was mainly about who didn't like her or who did
and who walked out when she read, etc. and how she was an outsider and
not supposed to write about Hawai'i and how the (local, I assume) poetry
was all very bad and she had to tap her finger so as not to be infected
by it. And it talked about how she feels like she shouldn't write about
Hawai'i but then it said things like I understand things better about
Hawai'i b/c I'm not from Hawai'i. (A theme that she spent 10 minutes on
later; saying that she never writes on Hawai'i and yet she read two long
pieces on Hawai'i.) She completely glossed over the thing with her and
Chin and Wong (which is reductive on both sides it seems; when someone
in the audience asked her why there were no Asian-Amer male writers
(?!),
she said it was b/c women read more books and go to college more).

Then she reads this story from her new novel that is about Hawai'i
(which she wrote from the clarity of California she tells us). And it is
about water and fishing. And has some of the worst pidgin I've heard (to
my tin mainland ears--it feels very fake; very limited vocabulary; lacks
obvious turns of phrase; but it cd be pidgin of 10 years ago; I'm no
expert here--in fact I get most of my pidgin via the local literature;
so I guess I should just say it doesn't sound as rich? or should I say
it doesn't sound all Bamboo Ridge?). And then it ends with this scene
where Whitman's (character from past novel) wife, who is haole, goes
down to the corner store. On the way there she thinks about how she is
beginning to see the darker side of paradise. And then she goes over to
talk to this group of local guys. They are sitting on a bench. All
together. And one of them is masturbating. And talking to her. He is
masturbating by rubbing back and forth on this bench, which is worn
smooth from all this rubbing. And the men take turns, sitting in this
masturbation seat.

During the question and answer she states that she now doesn't put
people in her books unless she asks them first. That it wasn't right of
her to write crazy people in her books, say. Or whatever. Someone,
finally, asks her about this scene, and say it doesn't sound very
respectful to the Hawaiians (although I think these men are just local
in the narrative and not more specific). She says, well it was true.

There was other stuff too. Lots of stuff about peace. And about how her
work was a response to the horrible wars of this century which we have
to cover over with peace, etc.

I'm trying not to overreact.  And I was thinking also about how I
can go to endlessly dull readings of avant garde stuff and yet I can't
take a little craziness on the normal stuff.

Then the next day, Listers Susan Schultz and me and nonlisters John
Zuern, Kyle Koza, Caroline Sinavaiana, and Rodney Morales organized this
fall festival event which we called Alter Englishes. We inherited the
festival from Robbie Shapard. It is a series of readings with a lot of
apparatus. Sometimes the apparatus makes me uncomfortable.

On Friday Cecilia Vicuna was 5 minutes late for her talk because I
forgot to tell her where it was. She came in the room apparently, I was
out looking for her, shaking a seed pod and saying "I'm very angry."
Then I came back and she started yelling at me but then gave me a hug
and said she forgave me. I think I must have looked very upset. She then
gave a great talk called "In Tongues Within." It was a version of her
talk at Bard. I love the talk. It is hopeful about language yet also
very aware of the political. She told a story about going to American
movies when she was a kid and then coming out of the theater and
everyone speaking in a fake english in order to mimic the language of
power. But she also talked about the ways indigenous languages
infiltrate into colonial languages. She whisper talked the talk. Which
fascinates me.

During the discussion Rob Wilson asked a question about utopianism in
her talk. Cecilia spoke in defense of acknowledging the disruptive
moments in languages with skill. She showed at this moment that she is
very, very smart. It is hard to negotiate here sometimes and she was
doing it with such skill and she had only been here for a half a day. I
think she must be used to the sorts of arguments about here. In the
midst of this Sina mentioned Epeli Hauofa's talk during the summer (I
missed it) and how he talked about the difference b/t utopia and
possibility and the importance of acknowledging possibilities within
colonial situations. I thought this was a good turn on the abyss we
sometimes find ourselves in here.

Myung Mi Kim was also supposed to speak but she couldn't make the
conference because she got in an automobile accident and then had to get
surgery.

AFter the talk Anne Tardos and Cecilia went to the beach. I was supposed
to go but I went to the lei story and then to buy some tablecloths with
Susan. We went back and set up for the bookfair (part of the apparatus).
And waited for the food (another part of the apparatus). The food was
delicious. Matt Lau who used to run my favorite neighborhood restaurant
made it. It was big slices of tofu in sauce and some chicken thing in
papaya sauce and rice and vegetables. We had ordered food for 300, which
is about how many people came last year. But only around 175 people
came. So the auditorium was too big and there was too much food and this
made me very paranoid.

But the reading was great. Eric Gamalinda read. He is our visiting
writer and I like him b/c he seems to always be in a good mood. His work
was interesting: lyrical, concerned with Filipino and/or F-American
identity, at moments going off in unexpected directions. It made me
happy. Cecilia read. She started singing from the audience. And this
caused some problem with the introducer who wanted to give her a lei and
who ended up following behind her across the stage in some sort of
shadow dance. She read some of her whisper poems. And Lee Tonouchi read.
Lee is a local pidgin writer. He kind of embodies pidgin machismo. It
kind of annoyed me at first but I'm beginning to forgive him. He does a
sort of stand up comedy act where he reads these stories about a guy's
girlfriend who is always dumb. I think he might be a force in the future
when his work becomes about more than the dumbness of girls.

After the reading I wanted to go out with the graduate students but Bill
didn't want to b/c he had to study. I became this good combination of
grumpy and paranoid and didn't sleep all night.

Talks the next day started at 10 am. Ku'ualoha Ho'omanawanui gave a talk
on the history of the Hawaiian language. She noted that in the 1860s
Hawai'i had the highest literacy rate in the world. That a very long
Hawaiian novel was serialized in the newspaper b/t 1860 and 1861. That
numerous works were translated into Hawaiian during this period. Things
like Shakespeare's Tempest. Then all this ended with the annexation. And
the Hawaiian language went into decline.

Anne gave a talk on why she writes multilingually. It was in the form of
a self interview and was very funny. She has a version of it at her
website. I would recommend checking it out and will not spoil it with
summary.

And Lee gave a talk called "Da Death of Pidgin?" that was about how
great pidgin was and kind of the joke, or not, was that pidgin was a
language that encompassed everything so that even English was pidgin. Or
I think his point here is that there is no pure pidgin. He was very
worried about avoiding pidgin standards. I liked it best though when he
talked about how he used pidgin to write letters to the editor and they
got printed and how he used pidgin fill out his job application teaching
English at KCC and he got the job and how he used pidgin for writing
graduate school papers and still passed. His talk greatly pleased me.

The discussion afterwards returned to language politics. Some members of
the audience felt that Anne was being too optimistic when she said she
wrote multilingually b/c that was what life was like for her. Or that
she was not making a nation argument b/c her work had the languages of
many nations in it. Anne avoided taking on the obvious marginalization
that was one possible response to this argument (that the reasons she
knows so many languages was that her parents were Jews and had to move a
lot to avoid anti-Semitism). I was reminded about how in life at times
there is just one argument. And had to say to myself yet again that one
of the reasons we should invite people from outside (although not
exclusively from outside--another problem with a long history) was that
they might see things differently and that this was good. Also stewing
underneath the discussions, but never vocalized around me, was the
complicated language politics here. Pidgin is out with certain
intellectuals (it is too Bamboo Ridge and thus neocolonial--I simplify
but so does this argument). Hawaiian is in. So I think Lee's inclusive
pidgin politics didn't really fly with some. Or that is what some people
said over lunch maybe but not where I was. I went to the lei store after
lunch.

At 2 Grace Molisa gave a talk on "Language, Gender, and Human Rights in
the Pacific." She is a writer from Vanuatu and she spoke movingly on
Vanuatu which is a country of over 80 islands with 170,000 people who
speak over 100 languages and the nation itself has three official
languages (Bislama, English, and French). She said that some people say
that Vanuatu has the highest languages per capita (I think it is Papua
N.G. that has the highest number of languages?). She spoke very slowly
and very articulately about illiteracy in Vanuatu (around 50%; higher
for women), about being one of few literate women and working in the new
government (Vanuatu went sovereign in the 80s), about her own education.
She also talked about how she is translating the universal declaration
of human rights into Bislama.

After her talk I went to the lei store again (we kept miscalculating).
And then we set up for the bookfair. And again only around 175 people
came and we had too much food which was complicated by the fact that
Matt was like 3 hours late with it and it made us all very hungry and
kind of crazed. Cecilia and I were eating fritos by the end.

Anyway, we started the reading without food. And Grace read first. She
read these amazing poems that were very unpoetic. Steve Carll called
them "memo poems." They were short poems with no metaphor or turns of
phrase. One went something like this in its entirety: emerging states
seek the help of outside advisors. Another was about what democracy was.
They fascinated me because they were not an obvious part of the
postcolonial tradition in terms of form (which often sounds like
Adrienne Rich). But they were very aware of poetry's role in
postcolonial situations. She writes her poems to explain things to
people in a way that they will remember them. She publishes her books
herself and I gave her the name of spd so I hope she will list with
them. I recommend them highly.

Anne read next. I was nervous about how her poems would be received but
the audience got them and laughed a lot. She read from Uxudo and also
had these poems displayed on the screen behind her. AT one point the
crazy lady who comes to all the readings here started reading along with
them and it created this wonderful additional voice from the audience.
There was also a great contrast between Grace's spare, information poems
and Anne's multilingual registers. I thought it worked and was a good
lesson on all that poetry can be for me.

Then Ku'ualoha had asked that she be able to turn her reading time over
for a creative presentation by the journal 'Oiwi (which she co-edits).
They had a gourd player and a flutist (I know I'm calling these things
by their wrong names which are very specific in Hawaiian) and several
readers and images on the screen. They read sections from the first
issue of the journal. The performance was restrained but also very
interesting. I liked its emphasis on the collective aspects of editing
and how that is what is important. I was a bit disappointed that they
for some reason decided to highlight the poem that compares butt fucking
to colonialism (the line is: "It's like/Getting fucked in the ass/Is
supposed to be/A turn on--/Get real!"; I've complained about this
before) by Mahealani Kamau'u. But otherwise it was very political and
kind of another interesting contrast with the readings that came before.
It pointed out one form that nationalist art might take inside a
university. And that seems very important.

Then we all ate some food. And then we went to the bar Shipley's. There
was more food there. Which would have been fine if we had eaten four
hours earlier when we were supposed to but didn't. We drank some stuff,
went home, slept for a long time. The next day Anne and Cecilia and Bill
and me went to Bellows, a beach that is owned by the military and you
can only visit on weekends. Cecilia rode on the body board a lot.
Afterwards we came home and Eric and Steve came over for dinner. We had
a series of salads for dinner.

A few days later Susan said we should start planning next year's. And I
thought I am still way too tired. Setting up readings here makes me too
tense b/c of the politics of things. I'm working hard on balance between
elsewhere and here and still that seems not right to many. I realized
while doing this that I like events that are no man's lands, that have
no affiliations. But sometimes that means that no one is interested. But
at the same time doing stuff here means bringing in people who you might
not otherwise hear ever. I wish more peope from other parts of the
Pacific came to read. And I enjoyed attending the event. The
conversation between elsewhere and here interested me. I kind of need
that friction in order to understand things.

I'm going to put the readings up on the web in a month or so (but not
the Kingston reading which I didn't organize). I'll let you know when I
do this.

fabulous auction items and raffle prizes and wondered "how

Kevin Killian. I'm thinking he should hire himself out as
a consultant, or at least professional autograph hound.

cancer subsides and angels happy Tue Oct 5 22:22:54 EDT 1999 arraignments

in the truth of god the cancer enters the lung, from the truth of god
the cancer hovers, now, as if it were forever Tue Oct 5 22:14:54 EDT 1999
abandoned by god, the cancer thins towards ready exculpation, as if it
were gone, as if angels rejoiced, singing the home of abandoned cancer,
the purity of organs constituted Tue Oct 5 22:15:56 EDT 1999 now cancer
returns, approbated by god, as if god were speaking or speech or sound,
now cancer spreads to the adrenal, angels weep in full capacity against
the begging of the angels arrayed against god, now cancer seeps, spreads,
covers itself, makes excuses, ahem, begs foregiveness, meanders, wanders,
returns, burrows, ahem Tue Oct 5 22:18:00 EDT 1999 now cancer subsides,
angels rejoice, god withdraws, there is no justice in the world, suns
blacken, angels sing and play harps, cancer dwindles, eyes return their
bright and merry sight Tue Oct 5 22:18:39 EDT 1999 now breathing slows,
waves of cancer testing other newer waters, new metastases, solitons and
wavelets, ripples on surfaces unseen, god smiles wide and broad, angels
shudder holding on Tue Oct 5 22:19:30 EDT 1999 now cancer claims an other
organ, angels again weeping and wailing, shall there be no mercy, angels
crying and begging, god almost merry, cancer hems and haws, cancer close
to apologetic laughter Tue Oct 5 22:20:26 EDT 1999 now cancer will begin
its work within the arms of god, angels prepare for bier and mourning,
angels yet hopeful in the face of god's huges eyes Tue Oct 5 22:21:30 EDT
1999 smiling everywhere, yet other organs, uncanny stillness, strangeness
of beings of pure light arrayed against skin, bones, organs, god's beings
against angels wailing Tue Oct 5 22:22:39 EDT 1999 arraignments during
final assaults and angels dying Tue Oct 5 22:23:21 EDT 1999 let us pray

Forgive the interruption
or did I see the young bamboo?
Things are not the same for one man,
the many poisonous insects that emerged
pursue us one after another
hanging from our shoulders
even the rude mountain had nothing
to hope for
there were still many empty fields
I am writing one
to see what a woman can do

When I try to climb I lower my eyes. The single note with thorns is
no place to write. A forest, indistinct, too shy to follow. Pure heart,
drunken stupor, clutching child. I'll be the revelation atop city walls.
But a man into ghosts seeks words that rhymes. Or does she feel
annoyed as she speeds away? The good man grows thorns.


meat-girl, body without syntax

with such happiness between
the clouds
ink freezes when I think of this
I have been unable
to gaze peacefully in the distance
the eyes dispair in disarray
I'm unable to sleep
where the dawn has not come yet
a face greatly changed
now I lean on sadness, there are limits
to know the world is vapor
it moves me to sing
distant spaces that await me hurt my heart
my regret gathers force
stilled in this presence



Sally Forth, dodecaphony@extant.kithara

Don't you see withered trees
I must leave among the clouds
Always the disturbing meditation
No one can give my food to the crows
Who lived scene by scene
Blooms burst her green mound
Flutes and wind once parted
My severe decay has yet to go where I go
I'm drunk and the world is vast
He's never been here & I lift up my skirt
In front of his meloncholy

elements of surprise & a capricious
warning finger "how do you know
a single word can be good?"
loss of verbal desire
but they are only improvisations
until he is loved by one of the puppets
consistent use of imitation
failed each morning in this rustic village

it is always the trace of the cut
that has had the desired effect
leading to a blurred noise
not one has survived
discontinuities which represent words
that might be her last breath

I'm no good at this but want to point to Karen Kelley's latest book, Venus
Return (Vatic Hum, SF), and say (in a deep voice to denote seriousness) that
the book deserves attention. the poems are worked in a carefully rendered
prose - as if she's had practice writing -- with uninflected, dream-like
shifts of place, mood, and attention. they have a viscous integrity, solid
but shifty; they might even be surreal but I never went to that school.
"What do you want? Buttered toast? Dollar bills? The meat in the pan? Lots
of books? Monogamy? Modest photos of yourself no one else will ever see?"
yes to all, as a matter of fact, especially the last, but here's the point:
I find myself chuckling at the dry humour that always arrives unexpected.
I'm caught off guard as I read, and eager for more surprises. the dreaminess
carries a sexy passion and a human confusion straight from the source. some
people think there's such a word as 'about' so I'll go so far as to say that
these poems are about gender, relationship and underwear. politicized
underwear, that is, and I'm not kidding. typefaces have been carefully
chosen and employed, with both visual impact and legibility equally
honoured: I commend that. I hope Venus Returns sounds as interesting as I
found it.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Arras can now be found at:

http://www.geocities.com/arras_online

Geocities is the place where you can get 11mb of server space for free,
which is why it's moved.  The drawback is that an ad banner pops up in a
new window.

My advice: DO NOT close the new window, only minimize it (that is, hit the
button with the single "_" in it rather than the one with the "x").  This
will keep the banner out of site while you navigate.  If you close the
window, it will reopen every time you hit a link, pretty annoying.

As they didn't have "Poetry" as a subject category, I chose "Issues and
Events," so the advertising is relatively innocuous.  All I've seen so far
is a banner for debt considation, which is actually kind of helpful.

Please change whatever links you have on your site to the new URL.  There
won't be any forwarding from the old URL, it'll just be dead.

Thanks so much to all of you who have visited the site and/or linked to it!
Much appreciated...

John,
  i just came across this quote - "Form has to do with how to shape a
given space" Gertrude Stein, _Stanzas in Meditation_ that i think
captures the process vs. static issue of forms quite nicely.

Roland Barthes, interior@speech.noise

The opposition spread under the protection of power. There are
those that no concious illusion is perpetrated. An entire orality
which produces a drift of bliss & fear. Fetish objects on the
other hand leaves expression to the pheno-text. As a creature
of language which permeates him very quietly the subject
returns were we fond of neologisms. This text bores me like a
spider dissolving. The text you write must prove the sentence is
hierarchical. Similarly, it is not only establishing the oppostion of
the way two girls must be politicized. Where is this elsewhere?
Nine times out of ten societies object to undifferentiated eye &
noteworthy Desire. Do not deign to be the persistence of the
thing. Neurosis are the means of ungratiated sucking, a glimpse
of scandalous truth, still far too much heroism to identify
accurately language's image. We are scientific clandestine sites.
This is to want a text which seizes the subject the way the
reversal of origins could not be written. And when something
remains a potlatch under respectable appearances, this is how I
have my best ideas.

I didnt dare
run along the Edge

Poetry is one
Great Essence

We steal a night
listening to its Sounds
I shall pity the innumerable
wilderness Moon
wandering in solitude


I scan thru texts
but discontent grows great
the former rage
fresh in the Frost
from Birth to Modern Times
echoes of Chimes and Bells
empty a Man's Mind




explain negation.

within even man, conversation.

contradiction.

contradiction.

confusion, cohabitation, vacillation, margin.

expansion written then.

in written contain within seduction.


Page Light Being, radiance / spectre / poise

I laugh at the arrival of a solitary crane
amorous heart is tears that wets one's clothes
but where I go butterflies fail to coax her
I'd like to say something in tense abstraction

my sorrow is great but can't compare
with your past great love
in opposite corners of the world
the same tart flavor
the present will last and get no worse

the void with a thunderous hum
somewhere atop the mulberry trees
never my loved ones have not returned
it was with them come what may

that's why I'm unable to sleep
as I turned my head
I'm satisfied with me
never quite undone I will not go gently






Pride Lustre, rosebush@petal.flicker

leaves
of rustling sorrow
into my heart

prisoners
continually
empty half a word

the vegetable
is as tasteless
as the sleeping dragon

my girl
smeared my pain
with a feeble light

exposing lotus
leaves I never
dreamed of her

silent passage
oblivious to desire

buckthorn trees
curse
the endless gods

how lovely
the longing for
encampment

like a fog
dabbled
she wouldn't dance

DEFIB LAUNCH: NEW LIVE ONLINE Web ARTIST INTERVIEW SURF SHOW
1ST & 3RD SUNDAYS, NOON PST
http://webartery.com/defib


SUNDAY OCTOBER 17, NOON PST (3RD SUNDAY OF OCT)
Talk with Talan Memmott and the contributors to the new issue of
BeeHive at high noon during the launch show of Defib, Webartery.com's
online chat interview/surf show featuring Web artists and their works
and projects. Vol 2, issue 4 of BeeHive is upcoming at
http://www.temporalimage.com/beehive/bee_core. All you need to
participate in this live discussion/surf show is a java enabled browser.


TALAN MEMMOTT AND BEEHIVE
Talan Memmott is a writer living and working in San Francisco,
California. He comes to writing from a background in fine art, having
studied painting, installation, video and performance art, as well as
critical theory. His hypertext theory/fiction work has appeared in the
online publications Perforations, Perihelion, Big Bridge and frAme.
Memmott currently works in the multimedia field as Production Director
for the web development firm PERCEPTICON and serves as Creative Director
for the literary hypermedia journal BeeHive. A new edition of BeeHive is
launching October 6/99 featuring work by Reiner Strasser, Michael White,
Claine Helen Keily, Jim Andrews, and an archive of the San Jose Valley
Poetry Slam Team that BeeHive covered during their cross country tour,
which culminated in their winning the national title. Probably several
of the contributors to BeeHive will be participating in this launch of
both Defib and the new issue of BeeHive.


DEFIB
Defib shows will be recorded and the transcript produced into a
full-blown hypertext available at webartery.com. This turning of the
live show into a different form after the fact will create a critical
record/document that accompanies the project/works under discussion.
Defib will roughly coincide with the launch of Web art projects by the
artists of Webartery.com and others. Upcoming shows include
Claire Dinsmore and the contributors to her new online magazine Cauldron
& Net (Sunday Nov 7, noon PST), Bill Marsh and his new broadcasting
project sunbrella.net (Sunday Nov 21, noon PST), and Miekal And and his

MIME-Version: 1.0

(This notice is sent periodically to the Cybermind/Fop-l lists - it's hard
for people to see what I'm attempting to do in writing/literature/theory/
reading - without books, etc. the best I can do is the mass of materials
at the websites - hoping you can read online - Alan - )

Internet Philosophy and Psychology -                               Oct.99

This is a somewhat periodic notice describing my Internet Text, available
on the Net, and sent in the form of texts to various lists. The URL is:
http://www.anu.edu.au/english/internet_txt/ which is partially mirrored at
http://lists.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/internet_txt.html. (The first
site includes some graphics, dhtml, The Case of the Real, etc.)

The changing nature of the email lists, Cybermind and Fiction-of-Philoso-
phy, to which the texts are sent individually, hides the full body of the
work; readers may not be aware of the continuity among them. The writing
may appear fragmented, created piecemeal, splintered from a non-existent
whole. On my end, the whole is evident, the texts extended into the lists,
part or transitional objects.

So this (periodic) notice is an attempt to recuperate the work as total-
ity, restrain its diaphanous existence. Below is an updated introduction.

-----

The "Internet Text" currently constitutes around 120 files, or 2800 print-
ed pages. It began in 1994, and continues as an extended meditation on
cyberspace, expanding into 'wild theory' and literatures.

Almost all of the text is in the form of short-waves or long-waves. The
former are the individually-titled sections, written in a variety of sty-
les, at times referencing other writers/theorists. The sections are inter-
related; on occasion emanations appear, avatars possessing philosophical
or psychological import. They also create and problematize narrative sub-
structures within the work as a whole. Such are Julu, Alan, Jennifer, and
Nikuko, in particular. Overall, I'm concerned with virtual-real subjectiv-
ity and its manifestations, in relation to various philosophical issues.
Recently, I've been dealing with dis/ease, the "ill" avatar, and binary
operations/processes in relation to transcendence and fragmentation.

The long-waves are fuzzy loci bearing on such issues as death, love, vir-
tual embodiment, the "granularity of the real," physical reality, computer
languages, and protocols. The loci weave throughout the text; the result-
ing splits and convergences owe something to phenomenology, programming,
deconstruction, linguistics, prehistory, etc., as well as to the function-
ings of online worlds in relation to everyday realities.

I have used MUDS, MOOS, talkers, perl, d/html, qbasic, linux, emacs, Cu-
SeeMe, etc., all tending towards a future of being-and-writing, texts
which act and engage beyond traditional reading practices. Some of the
work emerges out of performative language such as computer programs which
_do_ things; some emerges out of interferences with these programs, or
conversations using internet applications that are activated one way or
another. (Most recently, I use the "display" program in Slackware linux,
for example.)

There is no binarism in the texts, no series of definitive statements.
Virtuality is considered beyond the text- and web-scapes prevalent now.
The various issues of embodiment that will arrive with full-real VR are
already in embryonic existence, permitting the theorizing of present and
future sites, "spaces," nodes, and modalities of body/speech/community.

Please check the INDEX to find your way into the earlier body of the work.
The Case of the Real is a sustained work that may be the most useful text
of all. It is also helpful to read the first file, Net1.txt, and/or to
look at the latest files (lb, lc, etc., which are still to be indexed) as
well. Skip around. The Index lists the files in which a particular topic
is described; you can then do a search on the file, or simply scroll down
(the files range in length from 30 to 50 pages in print). (Note: I have
stopped working on the index; for the later files, I suggest you skim.
Eventually, I need a site and a local search engine for the texts; at the
moment, I apologize for the awkwardness of it all.)

The texts may be distributed in any medium; please credit me. I would ap-
preciate in return any comments you may have.

S E A M L E S S   A N T I L A N D S C A P E

                                by Leslie Scalapino


                        * * *


  some older poets say they are finished and say
the younger poets are finished as the older poets
have finished it the older poets have finished the
younger poets are finished     say the older poets
     is it the older poets have received too many
     compliments?


                        * * *


If critique and writing are not separate.... The writing is a 'collapsing'
of the distinction between real events and dreams, because my intention was
to look at what's happening in the mind then ('real time'?) -- also I was
looking at mind in its relation to the real outside (not that the outside
has created the mind -- your quoting of Marx -- or that the mind has
created the outside). That is, not discriminating as to the cause...
        The outside 'demonstrating cruelty' then, the writing does not
change or talk about the past of the outside -- it marks motions by the
writing's sound, people making small motions such as walking on the street.
There, they aren't 'expression' of oneself...


                        * * *


As if one only wrote an "emblem" of the "postmodernist metropolis" rather
than engaging being in Calcutta (or New York -- or Berkeley).
        In this, I am responding to Marjorie Perloff's essay "The Language
Poet as Autobiographer, Ron Silliman's Under Albany" in which choosing one
segment from a multi-segmented piece, which I wrote in 1974, in one passage
she compares me to Ron Silliman's mature writing (as well as that of
Michael Palmer and Barrett Watten)...


                        * * *


Critical writing embracing a type of contemporary poetry (much of) which
has a radical conceptual and social-political intention, sometimes
de-emphasizes or 'changes' the poets' intentions by stressing formal
aspects as if these were valuable for their 'form' (in itself) rather than
their form being that of a social/conceptual deconstruction taking place.
This tends to bring the poet into a lineage as socially 'understandable'
and understandable in that it is literary tradition...


                        * * *


        'what's the anxiety?': as not being in the state of constant change
-- in which there's no fear -- the neck cut out.


                        * * *


In an essay on Allen Ginsberg, Marjorie Perloff reinterpreted  Howl as not
in fact arising from pain -- i.e. not that which is connecting with his
time (that's why the present is the most disturbing time, to paraphrase
Stein) -- but rather as actually being comic, and now in a different time
can be understood to be comic. Calling Ginsberg a "comic bard," she
maintains that in that light his work can (should) now be accepted,
implying it could not be accepted if we interpret it as arising from pain.
There is a filter used there separating form and occurrence, which changes
the sense Ginsberg conveys as being that reality...

     Does anyone know of any critical studies or essays done on Tom
     Phillips?  They can be about his range of works, or specifically about
     works such as _A Humument_, from either a poetics or an art-historical
     perspective.   (To start, I have looked at the Humument website, and
     have pulled various newspaper and magazine articles, the most
     prominent being William Gass' _ArtForum_ essay, but that seems to only
     touch the tip of the iceberg.)

     Any help would be very much appreciated.

Skanky Possum Press is pleased to announce the release of its second title:

_Lucky Pup_, by Leslie Davis.

***

From the back of _Lucky Pup_:


Dear Leslie,

Just read Lucky Pup again, this time out loud. I ask myself, who’s the Lucky
Pup--the one who survived, or the other who gets out? Luck, indeed,
determines who gets to tell the story. The survivor leads the way through
terror and desire. Anguish yes, but with a new chance to come back to
testify on behalf of the beauty and mystery of being alive.

"Once the skin is broken there is no other way." You leave the skin behind
or you shed the old and reappear scorched with having lived, newly centered,
made angelic through death’s touch. Traditionally, the shaman takes the
illness of the tribe into him/herself in order to meet the pain in the
spirit world where it can be understood, reckoned with. Here, in your poem,
there’s a tension between memory and renewal, survival and the future. It’s
as if poetry could be an instruction manual, an aid to life. "When we met he
had a new tattoo. Two skeletons, dancing.  He called them silly guys." The
story or poem becomes a deal struck with yourself to look into the past
unflinchingly, with a personal and ethical responsibility. These things are
not to be forgotten, repressed. But understood, as an absence that
co-creates the self.

"So struggled into words.  Braille golden girl--skin against your
energy--continue..."  And so perfect here, the image of the blind reading
through touch, from the dark, reaching for the unseen.  Feeling and meaning
combine to reveal, yet it is the continuation of the unknown that somehow
stems from personal energy. "I’m the lucky pup. I get to know..."  "Teach
each other to teach each other to teach each other. The words get used up.
Come back to me in my dreams..." Yes. Teaching each other. The only course
for the living, for the survival of the tribe. For the self. "Tribal members
mark change with a physical marking of the body. Now I’ve got two. This is
what I grew into..."

This is a simple story, but perhaps the story, the only one that is recycled
time and again because of its urgency. The combination of nerve and mind to
confront memory with the deep visceral movements of language. The mind and
the body of the writer now move on, now do not, experience producing its own
kind of shroud at various, unexpected moments. What is it other than
temporary survival and teaching others? Which brings us to writing, a kind
of sharing of experience, the way the mind feels it. Truth and speech. Past
and future through present memory.

If any Bay Area people are interested in attending, Bei Dao will be
reading his poetry as part of the Stanford Presidential lecture series on
November 29.  You can find the location info on the Stanford web site.
The series is usually very well attended, so it's recommended that you
arrive early.

Here is the announcement of the opening of REVUE AUDIOLAB
http://homestudio.thing.net/

This review concerns all the composers, musicians and artists and gathers
today more than 350 headings about the new investigations and  researches
in music and sound . The review was built starting from documents resulting
from the www since several years, some originals having disappeared, others
being moved on other servers and finally the last being still on line. All
the articles kept their copyrights of course. The Revue wants to be a place
of consultation and center of interest around sound and musical emergences.
A search engine  integrated into the Revue makes it possible to seek in the
whole of the elements (more than 1000, texts and images) starting from key
words. Or the consultation can be done starting from the general index. The
review wants to be generating, the composers and artists wanting to
communicate texts and documents on their search can send their
contributions to the Revue .
The review wants to be also federative, it's not a plundering of texts, but
a gathering of contents and informations, as far as possible the original
addresses of the pages are noted in the page of the texts (if some miss,
thank you to prevent me). This gathering is carried out to feed reflexions
around the new musical and sound investigations, and if these pages were
copied and brought back on the server thing.net it is because much of them
already disappeared from the original servers and that certainly much of
them will disappear progressively with time. The authors can of course
claim the removal of their pages integrated in the review. Good reading.

The Edgewise ElectroLit Centre
Videopoem Festival

7:30pm

Saturday, November 7, 1999
Video In Studios,1965 Main Street, Vancouver, BC

Admission: $10

In this first annual event, Vancouver's own Edgewise ElectroLit Centre will
be
presenting Videopoems from across Canada and around the world. We have
solicited six pieces for one half of the show and have put out an
international
call for submissions in order to collect a diverse range of work in this
fledgling medium. Videopoetry festivals have occurred in places such as
Chicago, San Francisco (known as the Cinepoem Festival) and Roma, Italy.
This
event is the first of its kind in Canada and it is a much needed venue for
the
presentation of Canadian work in this genre.

Solicited work for this year's festival features:

Down Here, Bud Osborn (James Riley, Producer)
Verbomotorhead (Kedrick James, Producer)
Jill Battson (Jill Battson, Producer)
Chinese Cucumbers, Patricia Smith (Kurt Heintz, Producer)
Jason Le Heup (Jason Le Heup, Producer)

The goals of this festival are both to develop an audience for this genre in

Canada and the creation of an environment of exchange and learning among
artists. To this latter end, we have invited experienced producer, poet and
media artist, Jill Battson of Toronto, ON to speak at the festival on the
origins of the genre, its forms, and on the artistic and cultural context in

which it can flourish.

Funding for The Edgewise ElectroLit Centre Videopoem Festival has been
received
from the Canada Council for the Arts
and is produced in partnership with Video In Studios, Vancouver, BC.


The Edgewise ElectroLit Centre is a nonprofit society whose mandate is to
exploit communications technology to widen the audience of Canadian poetry
and
to give poets, multi-media artists and youth the opportunity to use, learn,
and
create with this technology. Videoconferencing and online publishing are the

major technologies that we work with. Our electronic magazine can be viewed
and
heard at <www.edgewisecafe.org>. Poets featured with audio include Adeena
Karasick, Wayde Compton, bill bissett and Sheri-D Wilson. We also publish
videopoems online and are hosting Canadas first Videopoem Festival at Video
In
Studios this fall.

I'd much appreciate your posting whatever you find out about critical
reaction to the work of Tom Phillips.  I doubt that there's much, for
the same reason there's almost nothing out there about ANY genuine
visual poets.

Just out: Carla Harryman's THE WORDS/AFTER CARL SANDBURG'S ROOTABAGA
STORIES AND JEAN-PAUL SARTRE (O Books, $12:00, ISBN # 1-882022-39-4;
distributed by Small Press Distribution, 1341 Seventh Street, Berkeley, CA
94710, phone 800-869-7553)

In this challenge to the separation of literary genres, Carla Harryman
takes as her points of departure two entirely disparate texts. Exploding
Jean-Paul Sartre's ideal of imagined autonomy, in his autobiography THE
WORDS, and inspired by the grostesque play of Sandburg's ROOTABAGA STORIES,
Harryman begins with her own account of an impossible and contemporary
childhood. In a world of recollected futurity, nihilists, chairs, amazons,
ghosts, and spool bablies, "We, the stranded" concoct their illusions of
spontaneous creativity.

"At last, children's literature has been liberated, liberated into fiction!
Carla Harryman's WORDS is a fiction in which the mischief is perpetually
unnaming names in an ongoing discursive cross-wind beneficial to
hybridizing texts. Bold and subversive." -- Marjorie Welish

"THE WORDS is not one novel, but many. Its economics are libidinal,
luxuriant, and layered: part roman fleuve, in which the first generation
born in the 'artificial jungles' of the Cold War comes of age 'on the
border that separates the absurd from the socially constructed reality,'
part roman a clef, in which every word will instantly recognize itself and
every fly allusion find its author in eternity, and part philosophical
romance in the mode of the later Wittgenstein, who proposed that 'the
double cross and the duck-rabbit might be among the spots [on] a wall
covered with spots.' And, because 'shadows dream in their niches,' this is
finally a utopian novel, everywhere transforming 'defeat into rapture.' In
(and with) THE WORDS, Carla Harryman has written a postmodern classic. It's
the book to take along to the proverbially deserted island." -- Ted Pearson

"A child touches a flower.
        Then a tip of air moves to fill the space moving a leg apart from a leg.
Slightly apart, the legs will promise a little breeze to the part. A
seamless song stays the tip of an invective against the child's mother. One
can't see the mirror on the tip of a flower.
                The cool child is father to the man
                The hard child is mother to the man
                The quiet child is mother to the woman
                The burning child is father to the woman"
                                -- Carla Harryman

I've found almost nothing at all on Phillips on the literature end of
things, though on the art end there are reviews and catalogs of
individual shows.

There is a selected bibliography in the catalog for an exhibition at North
Carolina Museum of Art:

Huston Paschal, _Tom Phillips: Selections from the Ruth and Marvin Sackner
Archive of Concrete and Visual Poetry_.  Raleigh: North Carolina Museum of
Art, 1990.

I am currently working on Phillips and would also appreciate any
suggestions.

I feel that it is necessary to say something about Bromige's beard. It is
not his beard at all! He stole it from me during one of his fly-by-night
visits up the coast. I am glad to see that it is arousing admiration among
USAmerican poets and others. But I would like it back.

We have an extrememly lively local poets group here in Atlanta, which
recently has begun discussing issues quite actively by e-mail,
supplementary to our frequent local get-togethers... The post below
started as a response to something the atanta poet Randy Prunty had
posted, commenting on an Atlanta figure who is big on the local "slam"
scene....As it progressed, it grew against my initial intentions into an
offhand review of Christopher Beach's excellent new book, Poetic Culture.
Soon i had written so many of my thoughts down that i figured it might
make sense to share 'em with a larger grouping...So i am posting this to
both the Atlanta group and the Buffalo List.   --Mark Prejsnar


(p.s. By the way, the mentions toward the beginning of this post of "our
kind of writing" etc. are addressed to my initial audience, the 11 or 12
members of the Atlanta Poets Group;  anyone interested in what that kind
of writing is, can check out a large selection of our work in the current
New Orleans Review, and in a special issue of Mirage #4 that will be out
fairly soon....)


The new book by C. Beach is very interesting.... From a point of view that
is very sympathetic to our kind of writing, he tries nonetheless to talk
about "what is happening" both sociologically and artistically in U.S.
poetry right now.... Two of the chapters are in-depth discussions of the
slam scene, and are very informative.  Beach tries to start from the point
of view that there is no "wrong" school to be in..and so compares slam,
workshop, and our kind of writing, attempting to be "fair".  For instance
in another chapter he examines the career and work of workshop maven
Stephen Dobyns in comparison to the career and work of Lyn Hejinian... (he
comes to the conclusion that, without prior prejudice about which type of
poetry is "good" and which "bad,"  Dobyns is a fairly weak poet and
Hejinian a pretty good one....Which makes sense to me; ...Most people wd.
suspect his claim to be so "without prejudice" about overall styles to
start with... But i think he would argue that he is reaching conclusions
about the relative strength of different contemporary camps..not starting
out with them.  And this claim to some extent is backed-up by his
treatment of slam work, which he like a whole lot more than workshop, and
treats with considerable respect.)

There are lots of weaknesses: apart from the fact that he makes an effort
to be respectful and enthusiastic about the slam scene, thus giving more
credit to shallow, silly work (in many instances) than it deserves, he
also makes certain theoretical moves that i believe are confused (but are
pretty uiversally agreed to on today's scene)  He uses the phrase
"avant-garde" or else "experimental" about once a page, in a 200 page
book;  and he believes that people like Bernstein, Mackey, Silliman,
Coolidge, belong to an "oppositional avant-garde" whose main raison d'etre
is to be against all mainstream culture and the social system, and also to
exist as a cohesive group (to at least some significant extent)...Thus he
claims that "post-language experimental poets,"  whom he represents by
"Writing from the New Coast," the O-Blek anthology, are terribly confused
and are floundering because they are not as cohesive a group, and do not
write as much theory, and do not have as much politix, or as confident a
sense of where they fit in history or of their mission, as the previous
generation.  In other words, he really (at the end) seems to lose track of
questions regarding what their poetry is like, and how good it is, because
he is caught up in questions of whether these newer poets can play
institutional and public-relations games with success.... I believe this
confusion on Beach's part comes from two things: the "sociological" slant
of much of his book (which is its strength by the way, in part, but which
ends up causing a certain obsession with the p.r. aspects of poetry's
public life);  and his commitment to the old concepts of "avant-garde" and
"experimental", which have in a way outlived thier usefulness.  (For
instance, i have been reflecting recently on the how much "camps" have
become institutionalized, in a way that is inflexible:  the generation of
Perelman, Silliman et al. use "avant-garde" and "experimental" all the
time, in discussing contemporary work, and this is also a broad general
practice today.... But previous generations of U.S. poets whsoe work was
challenging and mold-breaking, such as the generation of Pound, Williams,
Zukofsky, Stein, or the generation of Olson, Duncan and Spicer, did not so
identify themselves...They thought of what they were doing as "poetry,"
and aspired to have it seen as the strongest and most exciting work being
done in their time.,...It didn't occur to them to saddle themselves with
ghettoizing labels... What i feel strongly is that we have to get back to
that mindset... For the kind of work represented by the APG and many
people on the BuffaList, is simply the best work being done in the U.S.
... and i question whether we want to continue to police the boundaries by
using these terms...)

On a related note - does anyone have any leads on critical writings
pertaining to Phillips' sparse-but-fascinating output as a composer?

Hard to supress a snicker at the very idea of this subject line.  It's
enough of a desert here in Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill.  Of course, if
there IS anything I would like to know too.

Mark, I haven't read Beach's new book but I was disappointed in -- even
pissed off by -- the chapter on Hejinian and Dobyns when it came out in
Contemporary Literature.  If I recall, it made a few perfunctory gestures
in the direction of sociology (e.g., Bourdieu) and then went off into a
wholly predictable close reading of the two poets in which Hejinian
clearly comes off the "winner."  For all the sociological posturing, this
struck me a pointless exercise and an insult to the sociology of poetry.
Maybe the rest of the book is better, I'll have to see.

Cheers,
David

Bourdieu makes a few cameos, mostly in footnotes.  Insightful and concise
every time, but some development would be helpful. Personally, I came to
the book with  the same predispositions concerning Dobyns and Hejinian as
Beach displays. When Mark Presjner writes of this section of Beach's
book that...
----------------------------------------------------
MP:
in another chapter he examines the career and work of workshop maven
Stephen Dobyns in comparison to the career and work of Lyn Hejinian... (he
comes to the conclusion that, without prior prejudice about which type of
poetry is "good" and which "bad,"  Dobyns is a fairly weak poet and
Hejinian a pretty good one....Which makes sense to me; ...Most people wd.
suspect his claim to be so "without prejudice" about overall styles to
start with... But i think he would argue that he is reaching conclusions
about the relative strength of different contemporary camps..not starting
out with them.  And this claim to some extent is backed-up by his
treatment of slam work, which he like a whole lot more than workshop, and
treats with considerable respect.)
------------------------------------------------------
... I generally agree: he lets slammers get  away with things that Dobyns
pays for rather dearly. But I can't find where Beach says that he's
approaching Dobyns and Hejinian without prejudice. In the intro, Beach
writes "I have at times stated my own aesthetic criteria and preferences
quite strongly, as in teh comparison of the `mainstream' academic poet
Stephen Dobyns and the experimentalist Lyn Hejinian {hmmmm, why no scare
quotes around the equally dubious term "experimentalist"?}, and in my
critiques of poetry anthologies and academic creative writing programs.
While my intent has been to write a book that is synthetic and open-minded
rather than narrowly partisan, I do believ that certain sectors of
American poetic culture have been more successful than others in
articulaint new perspectives and in generating innovative formal and
cognitive structures..."(17-8)
        Which is why the point that David Kennedy raises is interesting:
is it possible to have (and express) one's own aesthetic preferences
without insulting the sociology of poetry? And if so, who are some of the
critics who pull it off?
        Asking out of curiousity, not hostility, petulance, etc.

Hello Mark -- I applaud your last thought here, about losing the terms
"avant-garde" -- it does create more ghettoization I think. Did you ever
publish the excerpts from "The Story of O" that you were once interested in?
Is Misc Proj even a going concern anymore?

Best,

Joe

Subject: Review of Beach's Poetic Culture


We have an extrememly lively local poets group here in Atlanta, which
recently has begun discussing issues quite actively by e-mail,
supplementary to our frequent local get-togethers... The post below
started as a response to something the atanta poet Randy Prunty had
posted, commenting on an Atlanta figure who is big on the local "slam"
scene....As it progressed, it grew against my initial intentions into an
offhand review of Christopher Beach's excellent new book, Poetic Culture.
Soon i had written so many of my thoughts down that i figured it might
make sense to share 'em with a larger grouping...So i am posting this to
both the Atlanta group and the Buffalo List.   --Mark Prejsnar


(p.s. By the way, the mentions toward the beginning of this post of "our
kind of writing" etc. are addressed to my initial audience, the 11 or 12
members of the Atlanta Poets Group;  anyone interested in what that kind
of writing is, can check out a large selection of our work in the current
New Orleans Review, and in a special issue of Mirage #4 that will be out
fairly soon....)


The new book by C. Beach is very interesting.... From a point of view that
is very sympathetic to our kind of writing, he tries nonetheless to talk
about "what is happening" both sociologically and artistically in U.S.
poetry right now.... Two of the chapters are in-depth discussions of the
slam scene, and are very informative.  Beach tries to start from the point
of view that there is no "wrong" school to be in..and so compares slam,
workshop, and our kind of writing, attempting to be "fair".  For instance
in another chapter he examines the career and work of workshop maven
Stephen Dobyns in comparison to the career and work of Lyn Hejinian... (he
comes to the conclusion that, without prior prejudice about which type of
poetry is "good" and which "bad,"  Dobyns is a fairly weak poet and
Hejinian a pretty good one....Which makes sense to me; ...Most people wd.
suspect his claim to be so "without prejudice" about overall styles to
start with... But i think he would argue that he is reaching conclusions
about the relative strength of different contemporary camps..not starting
out with them.  And this claim to some extent is backed-up by his
treatment of slam work, which he like a whole lot more than workshop, and
treats with considerable respect.)

There are lots of weaknesses: apart from the fact that he makes an effort
to be respectful and enthusiastic about the slam scene, thus giving more
credit to shallow, silly work (in many instances) than it deserves, he
also makes certain theoretical moves that i believe are confused (but are
pretty uiversally agreed to on today's scene)  He uses the phrase
"avant-garde" or else "experimental" about once a page, in a 200 page
book;  and he believes that people like Bernstein, Mackey, Silliman,
Coolidge, belong to an "oppositional avant-garde" whose main raison d'etre
is to be against all mainstream culture and the social system, and also to
exist as a cohesive group (to at least some significant extent)...Thus he
claims that "post-language experimental poets,"  whom he represents by
"Writing from the New Coast," the O-Blek anthology, are terribly confused
and are floundering because they are not as cohesive a group, and do not
write as much theory, and do not have as much politix, or as confident a
sense of where they fit in history or of their mission, as the previous
generation.  In other words, he really (at the end) seems to lose track of
questions regarding what their poetry is like, and how good it is, because
he is caught up in questions of whether these newer poets can play
institutional and public-relations games with success.... I believe this
confusion on Beach's part comes from two things: the "sociological" slant
of much of his book (which is its strength by the way, in part, but which
ends up causing a certain obsession with the p.r. aspects of poetry's
public life);  and his commitment to the old concepts of "avant-garde" and
"experimental", which have in a way outlived thier usefulness.  (For
instance, i have been reflecting recently on the how much "camps" have
become institutionalized, in a way that is inflexible:  the generation of
Perelman, Silliman et al. use "avant-garde" and "experimental" all the
time, in discussing contemporary work, and this is also a broad general
practice today.... But previous generations of U.S. poets whsoe work was
challenging and mold-breaking, such as the generation of Pound, Williams,
Zukofsky, Stein, or the generation of Olson, Duncan and Spicer, did not so
identify themselves...They thought of what they were doing as "poetry,"
and aspired to have it seen as the strongest and most exciting work being
done in their time.,...It didn't occur to them to saddle themselves with
ghettoizing labels... What i feel strongly is that we have to get back to
that mindset... For the kind of work represented by the APG and many
people on the BuffaList, is simply the best work being done in the U.S.
... and i question whether we want to continue to police the boundaries by
using these terms...)

IF YOU GO OUT FOR FAKE BEER AND NEVER COME BACK


who will click keys in the door,
stack the towels on the too-high shelf,
talk to the plumber while he works,
sleep on the right side of the bed?
How dare you leave and not take your smell with you?
“Your thigh is cool,” you said,
“like a puddle on a basement floor.”
The brown mole on your sad thin back,
your narrow shoulders and crooked smile,
your unopened mail.
I never even gave you a drawer.
(You kept your big plastic suitcase under the bed.)
I will rope off your work boots like a museum,
draw a chalk line around your dirty T-shirt where it fell.

I loiter at the patch of once wet sidewalk
where you carved your initials with a straw.
Someday I will pass that spot
and not think about you at all.
Then I will pack your plastic suitcase
and put it on the street.
Soon I'll see a bum wearing your old shoes.

Shelley Stenhouse's fiction and poetry have appeared in The Antioch
Review, Third Coast, Mudfish, and other publications. Her work has been
nominated for a Pushcart Prize and excerpted in Poet's Market. She
received an MFA in fiction from Vermont College, was a 1998 and 1999
resident of Yaddo, and is an ongoing member of the Writers Room, where
she is completing her first novel. She wrote and performed a one-woman
show in 1989. Shelley was born in Chicago, and now lives in Greenwich
Village with her daughter, Daisygreen.

The poems in Shelley Stenhouse’s Pants emerge from a childhood of
privilege, one in which the speaker’s father “president of something
downtown / at thirty five,” teaches her this primary ethic “You do what
you do, you do it-- / Christ, you just do what you want”-- and she
learns from her  other how to squander the body on sex and booze, as
though it were limitless cash. In vivid scenes,  he poems show how
powerful these parental lessons are, as the speaker’s own adolescence
and then adulthood replay the drama of promiscuity, alcohol and drug
use, and emotional alienation. In spite of legacy enacted here, the
voice refuses the easy answers of tabloid and talk show sterotypes.
Under the poet’s unrelenting reguard, these sinners (father, mother,
self) are revisited through metaphors that reveal how complex human
choice and action are, and through a music that captures “that moment
before things turn, that moment / when something sings...”

    over the years, WCL  has featured Here and There: Between South Asias;
Transporting the Emporium: Hong Kong Art and Writing Through the Ends of
Time; and North: New African Canadian Writing.
    The journal has honoured Canadians like the Tish poets, Phyllis Webb,
Warren Tallman, Roy Kiyooka and bpNichol.  We have done community outreach,
like the 1998 Beyond the H Orizon: bpNichol + 10 conference and the 1997
SiteLines writers' retreat, not to mention lots of readings.

West Coast Line needs your help.

LEST WE FORGET, A MORALITY PLAY BY JENNIFER, NIKUKO, JULU, AND ALAN


PROLOGUE BY BUKHARIN: Repentence is often attributed to the Dostoyevsky
mind, to the specific properties ofthe soul ("l'ame slave" as it is
called), and this can be said of types like Alyosha Karamazov, the heroes
of the "Idiot" and other Dostoyevsky characters, who are prepared to stand
up in the public square and cry: "Beat me, Orthodox Christians, I am a
villain!" But that is not the case here at all. "L'ame slave" and the psy-
chology of Dostoyevsky characters are a thing of the remote past in our
country, the pluperfect tense. Such types do not exist in our country, or
exist perhaps only on the outskirts of small provincial towns, if they do
even there. On the contrary, such a psychology is to be found in Western
Europe.

JULU: Excellent. And this is what I want you to do, Alan, and this is what
I want you to say. You will learn from a very good way to learn:

VYSHINSKY: Tell us the nature of your wrecking activities.
ZUBAREV: When I was working in the seed cultivation department of the Peo-
ple's Commissariat of Agriculture of the U.S.S.R., they were of the nature
that the accused Chernov spoke about yesterday: causing confusion in seed
cultivation, lowering the quality of the seeds, employing bad quality mat-
erials, bad sifting, careless storing, and the result of all this was not
only a reduction of yield, but also a hostile mood of the peasantry, dis-
satisfaction with these so-called selected seeds.

Alan: This is excellent, and I will do my very best.

VYSHINSKY: What was the nature of your criminal activities in the People's
Commissariat of Agriculture of the R.S.F.S.R.?
ZUBAREV: Here my criminal activities consisted first of all in wrongly
planning the sowing of vegetables; in particular, little attention was
paid to the development of vegetable growing in our eastern districts,
where the developing of vegetable growing was of enormous importance...

Jennifer: I am learning so very hard here.

PEOPLE'S COMMISSARIAT OF JUSTICE OF THE U.S.S.R. REPORT OF COURT PROCEED-
INGS IN THE CASE OF THE ANTI-SOVIET "BLOC OF RIGHTS AND TROTSKYITES" Heard
Before the MILITARY COLLEGIUM OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE U.S.S.R. Moscow,
March 2-13, VERBATIM REPORT, Published by the PEOPLE'S COMMISSARIAT OF
JUSTICE OF THE U.S.S.R. MOSCOW 1938.

Jennifer, Julu, and Nikuko applaud.
All three together: This is wonderful!

VYSHINSKY: How matters stood with butter, this is of interest to me at
this stage of the investigation. You have spoken of salt, of sugar, how
you held back these commodities from sale to the population by sabotage,
etc. But how did matters stand with butter?
ZELENSKY: We don't sell butter in the rural districts.
VYSHINSKY: I am not asking you what you sell. You were above all selling
the main thing - your country...

Alan: I see how this goes. This is amazing. They have been found out, and
it is clear at the very end that the wreckers are executed. Nothing could
be clearer. One must be at the service of one's country.

LEVIN: ...Gorky loved fire, flames, and we made use of this. A bonfire
would be lit up for him. Just when Gorky would feel the fatigue after his
work, all the chopped branches were gathered together, and a flame kind-
led. Gorky would stand near this bonfire, it was hot there, and all this
had a harmful effect on his health... ...And in fact, on the second or
third day after his arrival in this grippe-infected house, Gorky fell sick
with the grippe. This was soon complicated by croupous pneumonia and imme-
diately took a serious turn. Nonetheless, Professor Pletnev and I consid-
ered that the plan we had drawn up must be carried through, and that for
this purpose use must be made of medicines which would be harmful to him.

Julu: Oh oh, that is so awful! This is such an awful thing! I cannot be-
lieve how awful this is!

THE PRESIDENT: As regards wrecking work, that it was necessary to bring
about a decrease in the number of livestock.
RYKOV: Even more than that. These instructions, as Goloded said, were duly
received from the poles...

Jennifer: Oh! Oh! Oh! Attacks from every side!
Nikuko: Oh! Woe! Attacks from within and without!

KRESTINSKY: ...Further Trotsky developed the idea of the necessity of ter-
rorism, wrecking activities and diversions. In speaking of them, Trotsky
considered diversionist acts and acts of terrorism from the point of view
both of applying them in time of war for the purpose of disorganizing the
defensive capacity of the Red Army, for disorganizing the government by
the moment of the coup d'etat, and at the same time, these diversionist
and terrorist acts would make his, Trotsky's, position stronger and would
give him more confidence in his negotiations with foreign governments, be-
cause he would be able to refer to the fact that his followers in the Sov-
iet Union were both sufficiently strong and sufficiently active...

Julu: Oh dearest us! How awful is Trotsky! Something must be done and now!
There are foes on every side! There are foes inside and out!

KAKAZOV: ...Now when I stand before you, Citizens Judges, as the murderer
of Menzhinsky, I cannot help shuddering and being overcome with horror
when I think of the despicable crime into which I was dragged. Not for a
minute do I want to disclaim the blame for this crime. On the contrary I
want to repent of this crime to the end and rid myself of this nightmare.

Alan: Oh curses on Kakazov for his perfidious crime! To death with perfid-
ious Kakazov!

On the basis of the aforesaid, and guided by Articles 319 and 320 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure of the R.S.F.S.R., The Military Collegium of
the Supreme Court of the U.S.S.R. Sentences...[list of 18 men]...to the
supreme penalty - to be shot, with the confiscation of all their personal
property.

All: Oh we are saved from the wrecking and saboteurs of our country! Death
to the traitors! Death to the BLOC OF RIGHTS AND TROTSKYITES! Death to the
Jews!

Nikuko: This is a wonderful play, Ladies and Gentlemen, and we hope you
have enjoyed it. We have given you much to think on, because the truth,
which is always difficult, is the best play in the world! Please take care
on your way out! Thank you!

KIM IL SUNG: Hello, I am a member of the audience and I am very happy to
see this play. If more countries, even though small, pool their strength
and fight resolutely against imperialism, the peoples can knock down U.S.
imperialism with decisively overwhelming power on each and every front.
The people of every country making revolution should tear limbs off the
U.S. beast all over the world and behead it. The U.S. imperialists appear
to be strong, but when the peoples of many countries attack them from all
sides and join in mutilating them in that way, they will become impotent
and bite the dust in the end.

Jennifer: But oh Great Leader, what is to be done?

KIM IL SUNG: Hello, Our Party will fight against Right and 'Left' oppor-
tunism, while upholding the banner of unity.

Julu: Oh that is so good, we will drag down the renegades of the revolu-
tion!

PRESIDENT AND KIM IL SUNG: Yes, ABSOLUTEly!

All Laugh!

Exeunt Omnes.

Poems by Rachel Loden

Winner of the Contemporary Poetry Series competition
University of Georgia Press, 1999

ISBN: 0820321699

___________________________________________________________


"Fierce humor has HOTEL IMPERIUM, as well as a heady run in which Nixon
and brassieres stud the trail; the whole century bends its tragedy
beneath Rachel Loden’s clear intelligence.  These are brilliant, moving
poems--poems to read for pure joy and chills over and over from here on
out."
        --Susan Wheeler

"Rachel Loden is not merely fashionable or current.  She’s a
late-century muse of everything valuable in poetry--voice, shape, and
gesture.  Add to that a wicked sense of humor and a disarmingly fresh
and penetrating eye for social and political concerns.  But her poems
are not political in the simple sense of the word.  Loden’s poetry
guarantees complexity as it charts new territory with assurance.  Rarely
does a writer emerge with such authority.  HOTEL IMPERIUM is the debut
of a startlingly original writer."
        --Maxine Chernoff

"Ablaze with moral passion, hushed in fairy-tale bliss, or chuckling up
to terror, Rachel Loden's tight poems of intricate subversion are
gloriously musical, alive to each scintilla of sound and measure."
        --Stephanie Strickland

"Steadily, with imaginative insight, humor, sarcasm, irony, Rachel Loden
looks at history, the great continuous and absolutely unstoppable weave
of memories that is, like it or not, the medium of human existence.
Definitely ‘residential’, her HOTEL IMPERIUM is “a murderous dream,
confetti falling / helplessly into the fissured past” (“Premillennial
Tristesse”).  In its corridors and rooms, Loden makes us confront many
of the century’s still active ghosts, in manifestations both familiar
and wittily defamiliarized: “The old man’s overcoat stirs / in the dark,
as though / about to cup a hand once more / to an unhearing ear ...”
(“Reagan Ascending into Hollywood”).  Political in the best and rarest
sense of the word, Loden’s poems show us how to reimagine our (and
others’) lives, with a vividness reminiscent of both the COMMEDIA and
SPRING & ALL.  In sum: great, terrifying, insidiously beautiful work!"
        --Anselm Hollo

"If you are looking for a book of poems ruthless and luxuriant enough to
see you into the third millennium, take along Rachel Loden’s HOTEL
IMPERIUM, winner of the 1999 University of Georgia Press Contemporary
Poets Prize.  These startling and vibrant poems capture the tristesse of
the post-apocalyptic era, the whimpering end of the Cold War, and the
"irrational exuberance" that comes "after the end."  Loden’s poems are
especially necessary and important now, because they will temper the
noisy hype of millennial newness and its promise of release from
history.  "You will enter history," announces the book’s first section,
which mourns the last fifty years of a brutal century, while refusing to
be consoled by apocalyptic fantasies of rebirth or regeneration. . . .

"In the extraterritorial Hotel-world of global capital, we are all on
the move, whether as tourists, refugees, or vagabonds.  Loden’s "Hotel
Imperium" is peopled with strange and ghostly lodgers, most notably the
former leaders of the Western world and the Soviet Bloc.  Represented by
Loden in their mental and physical decline, these "cold warriors, like
dying jellyfish," are beginning to "grow dim."  Richard Nixon slips "in
and out of consciousness," while his dog Checkers, about to be exhumed,
speaks reassuring words from beyond the grave.  Ronald Reagan’s
overcoat, enlivened after museum enshrinement proceedings, gives a last,
and amiable, salute.  We contemplate "Lenin’s body [on display in a Red
Square mausoleum], chilly like a mammoth / in an ice floe."  Loden is at
her best when she combines her grimly acute historical observations with
the "errant / sweetness" and breadth of learning characteristic of her
book’s guiding presence, Robert Duncan.  Then we re-experience, with a
shock, our century’s unholy mixture of paradise and wasteland.

"The human body--erotic, ecstatic, torn, and tortured--is a constant
presence in HOTEL IMPERIUM.  The book’s presiding spirit is the violated
figure of "revenge," who "lies sweetly in the fields / with her legs
open, / her Bo Peep / petticoats in ribbons."  To this bloody figure and
its promise of future violence, Loden proposes a counter-figure, "love."
If love cannot offer us redemption ("saving nothing standing in its
wake"), it can offer us new histories out of which new futures may be
possible.  We are lucky to have in Rachel Loden a troubadour unafraid to
sing of terror, and a brilliant balladeer of our history’s shabbiest
episodes.  As we move into a new millennium, we should listen carefully
to this self-professed "rhapsodist of cunning" and "songbird of
iniquity" as she sings sweetly of  "love, revenge, remaindering."
        --Kathleen Crown, in AMERICAN LETTERS & COMMENTARY

but i'd love to know how many listees there are in

As far as i know Mary Ann Caws up at CUNY has written some essays on
Phillips, though i'm not sure where they are located.  It's a starting

Just a request -- could people please try to remember to list the city
when they're listing readings?  Sometimes they forget and they just say
"2nd Street" and it all seems a little vague...second street anywhere in
the world?

Thanks,

"Dell-high")

There are some wonderful essays on a web site devoted to his work.  In
particular, I'm thinking of an essay by William Gass.

A few weeks ago Hank Lazer mentioned Paul Naylor's book _Singing the Holes in
History_(Northwestern University Press).  I want to recommend it also.  The
author, Paul Naylor,  gives interesting readings of Susan Howe, Nathaniel
Mackey, Lyn Hejinian, Kamau Brathwaite and M. Nourbese Phillip

Andrei Codrescu's Radio Messiah
Wednesday, October 20, 8pm
Makor 35 West 67 Street (Bet. Columbus and Central Park West)
New York City
$12; call 212.601.1000 for reservations

Radio Messiah is a one-man show by Andrei Codrescu with radio voices from
preachers, gurus, and conspiracy theorists. This piece is about fathers,
earthly and heavenly. Originally commissioned by Lincoln Center for their
Directors' Workshop, Radio Messiah was performed twice, once at Lincoln
Center and shortly after at Central Park's SummerStage in the Fall of 1998.
The play is indirectly connected with Andrei Codrescu's novel, Messiah
(Simon & Schuster, 1999). Andrei will be signing Messiah, Ay,Cuba and an
anthology from the anti-literary literary journal he edits, Thus Spake the
Corpse: An Exquisite Corpse Reader 1988-1998, Poetry and Essays.
Andrei Codrescu may be most popularly known for his sardonic, humor-laced
radio essays, heard since 1983 on National Public Radio's All Things
Considered. In these essays Codrescu has ranged from describing his
encounters with a young hustler and an un-official Catholic saint in Cuba,
to musing on American pop culture and reporting on his return to his native
Romania after the fall of the Iron Curtain.

David Zauhar asks where Beach says he is without prejudice;  well, i think
what i said, or anyway what i *meant*, tho maybe i expressed it badly, is
precisely conveyed by a passage DZ proceeds to quote:

"While my intent has been to write a book that is synthetic and
open-minded rather than narrowly partisan, I do believ that certain
sectors of American poetic culture have been more successful than others
in articulaint new perspectives and in generating innovative formal and
cognitive structures..."(17-8)


--i meant no more than what Beach means here:  that he is trying to be
"open-minded rather than narrowly partisan."  I think the general approach
by the way is interesting and probably a useful move, in the overall
context of the ongoing poetry wars... (..in those wars i am usually pretty
much a narrow partisan myself, lurking in the mountains, making
hit-and-run attacks on the better-eqipped and well-funded occupying
forces...*But* i dream of a just negotiated peace....)

Obviously, many will claim Beach hasn't succeeded in his "open-minded
rather than narrow" goal.... I myself have mixed feelings... But the idea
and the attempt are praiseworthy.

The difficulty here is that it sets up the game in favor of the
experimentalist.  I doubt Dobyns would view his own poetry's importance in the
way it articulates new perspectives or generates innovative formal and
cognitive structures -- there might be other terms he would use -- so the fact
that his work _doesn't_ do that is of no consequence.  None.  Nor do these
criteria make any headway into understanding what readers actually _do_ with
Dobyns, which as far as I could tell Beach couldn't care less about.  Certainly
the article in Contemporary Literature, on which I assume this chapter is
based, provided no such analysis.  Perhaps the values of Dobyns's audience are
not Beach's -- given that possibility, it is at least worth asking what people
who _do_ get something out of it get.

I'm no fan of Stephen Dobyns.  But Beach's article is not cultural criticism or
literary sociology.

I think Maria Damon pulls it off pretty well.  Charles Bernstein does it OK
too, although his calls for diversity are rarely, in my experience, made in the
direction of mainstream poetry.  (Much as Adrienne Rich quotes Bernstein in the
intro to her Best of . . . selection but then prints nothing of his
compatriots').  Cary Nelson does it well in Repression and Recovery.

Well said, especially given that my own earlier post was nothing if not
hostile.

Got the Beach book from the library this a.m., read it quickly, and will respond
to the whole, rather than to my memory of a part, shortly.  My initial reaction,
having read it _very quickly_, is somewhat more positive than my reaction to the
Hejinian/Dobyns chapter in _Contemporary Literature_.  As one committed to my
own Bourdieuvian (?) analysis of contemporary poetry, I can't help thinking that
in trying to provide a "defense" of poetry against "the impoverished cultural
spirit of American life" in the _midst_ of a sociology is a betrayal of
Bourdieu's best bits, as in the following:

"There is a specific economy of the literary and artistic field, based on a
particular form of belief.  And the major difficulty lies in the need to make a
radical break with this belief and with the deceptive certainties of the
language of celebration, without thereby forgetting that they are part of the
very reality we are seeking to understand, and that, as such, they must have a
place in the model intended to explain it. . . . The work of art is an object
which exists as such only by virtue of the (collective) belief which knows and
acknowledges it as a work of art.  Consequently, in order to escape from the
usual choice between celebratory effusions and the reductive analysis which,
failing to take account of the fact of belief in the work of art and of the
social conditions which produce that belief, destroys the work of art as such, a
rigorous science of art must, pace both the unbelievers and iconoclasts and also
the believers, assert the possibility and necessity of understanding the work in
its reality as a fetish; it has to take into account everything which helps to
constitute the work of art as such, not least the discourses of direct and
disguised celebration which are among the social conditions of production of the
work of art qua object of belief."  (Bourdieu, The Field of Cultural Production,
1993, p. 35)

More to follow.

Most all of our books are still in boxes, so I can't be any more specific,
but I know there was a special issue of the Canadian magazine Open Letter
sometime in the, probably, late 1980s, that focused on Tom Phillips, Ian
Hamilton Finlay, & someone else I can't remember.

Stephanie Strickland will be reading from my books HOTEL IMPERIUM and
THE LAST CAMPAIGN at the Hudson Valley Writers' Center this Sunday,
October 17, at 4:30 p.m.  I've read the poems to her and she's read them
back to me so I know she reads them brilliantly.  The other readers are
Andrea Louie and Sharon Mesmer.  Louie is author of a novel, MOON CAKES.
She's publications director at the Asian American Writers' Workshop, has
had residencies at the Macdowell Colony and Yaddo, and is a freelance
writer and editor.  Mesmer has a poetry collection, HALF ANGEL, HALF
LUNCH, and a story collection, THE EMPTY QUARTER.  She teaches fiction
writing and literature at the New School.

There's a train out of Grand Central on Metro-North's Hudson line that
leaves at 3:20 and brings you literally to the site of the reading (the
center's digs at Philipse Manor) a little after 4 p.m.  Info kiosk folk
at Grand Central can easily tell you the track number for the 3:20 to
Philipse Manor.  Center email: info@writerscenter.org.  Please come!

i'm toeing into unknown waters here
as i have not, as yet read the book
but to the above i wd like to ask one question

david, are you actually "behind" the notion
that it is only sympathetic readers of dobyns
that only their *use* of said poet is worthwhile
is "of consequence" ?

now, i grant, immediately, that in a sociology
of anything one wd want to have this "inside"
view of the dobyns' lovin poetry public
(i'm somewhat curious as to why they do like him myself)

but, do we believe that bourdieu (or anyone) can
in fact, step outside of their slurs, preconceptions etc
sufficiently to provide the analysis that you seem
to be calling beach to task for ?

again, forgive if my comments arent to the point
as i have not read this book, i simply wonder
at the implications in some of this

for instance, if bourdieu only makes an appearance
in footnotes perhaps holding beach to the yardstick
of him isnt' quite appropriate ?  perhaps
that is "of no consequence" as it doesnt address itself
to what the book _does_ for those who've
found it interesting and an OK introduction to
slices of the poetic pie that they might not otherwise
come upon (as it seem to have for mark p
 in relation to the slam stuff) ??

a few more thoughts about all of this

david, you quoted a passage from bourdieu
from which i wd like to examine briefly;

>
well, i already questioned whether this
seeming objectivity cd be attained, but
just now i'm wondering about why exactly
the attempt to

"understand the work of art in it's reality as a fetish"

isnt swallowed by the proposed economy
of the literary and artistic field --- and thus
this understanding of the work of art
in it's "reality as fetish" yet another things which
would need "find it's place in the model"

arent works of art often fetishized by those
who also have beliefs of varying sorts about
art ---- consider gallery owners
who in some instances cd care less about
the work but wish to surround it with the aura
to fetishize it, such that it will sell --- this
is different certainly, but how different ?

perhaps i am not clear on bourdieu's use
of the word "fetish" ?

anyway

david or anyone familiar with bourdieu, my apologies
if i'm asking boneheaded questions that
were i familiar with his work i wdnt waste my time
on --- but, i've seen some uses made of his name
in places where the conclusions drawn made me
less than confident about bourdieu's thought

I've been following the discussion of Beach's book with great interest.
I've also been reading Bourdieu while doing an analysis of the poetry
reading public in contemporary Spain.

While reading _Distinctions_ it strikes me that Bourdieu vacates aesthetic
pleasure on several levels:

High-brow and avant-garde models of aesthetics reinforce social privilege
and negate actual pleasure.

Bourdieu scorns middle-brow culture in a scathing chapter entitled
"Cultural Good Will." At least that's how I read him. It is the
petit-bourgeois's earnest attempt to attain cultural capital, but will
always be judged infeior in relation to the high brow elite.

The culture of the popular classes has virtually no value for Bourdieu
either. It simply reflects a deep cultural deprivation. It is a taste
based on preferring what is after all only a fulfillment of basic
necessities.

Bourdieu is no relativist:  he doesn't think that popular or mass culture
is as good or as valuable as "high culture."  But the latter is tainted by
its social role as marker of cultural prestige and its denial of pleasure.
Bourdieu analyzes all this quite brilliantly, but I find little comfort in
him...

Please correct me if I'm wrong, those who have studied this in more depth
than I have...

*************

Wrong.  Dead wrong.  As a reader of poetry (and therefore as a critic as
well), it's my right AND (to wax civic here a bit) my duty, to decide what
is important in poetry.

S. Dobyns and all others, have in turn the right to dismiss the criteria i
believe in..... But, no, i don't believe that a critic like Beach should
ask "does Dobyns accomplish what he sets out to do" ? (or rather, he
shouldn't make that his main concern, as implied in the quote above..It
will usually be one factor that needs discussing)  Part of what Beach
*should* be doing is: articulating a set of framing arguments regarding
what he thinks poetry ought to be doing.........And judging Dobyns
accordingly.  The critic's task is to think,  not just render passive
evaluation on execution, defering to rules laid down by the poet...

Being pretty much a lurker, though long time on the list, I've been waiting
for someone else to speak up about sondheim's all too often "poetry" posting
to this list. It seems he just views this list as a place to post whatever
comes off his typewriter.
is there any way to say, just one a week a week, or, allan spend a little
time with the poem/work before springing onto the hundreds of readers of
this list.

re Paul Naylor's Poetic investigations:

I have read so far the intro and the 1st chapter (on Howe);  a very
interesting book--it seems a little quaint to me: Naylor, who (like your
trusty correspondent) strongly identifies with active left political
engagement, makes that political viewpoint the main organizing strand of
his book . (Unlike moi, he follows the current fashion of dismissing most
of the long tradition of socialism, embracing in its stead the political
theories of Mouffe and Leclau..) His strong adherence to a serious leftism
causes him to actually start each discussion (in what i've read so far)
with a rather defensive explanation that yes the work of these poets is
very dense and impenetrable, and appears to be solipsistic and opaque, but
he will show how it is actually good writing characterized by a
responsible social and political engagement... Thus, he (more or less
consciously) piches his analysis in the key of your "activist in the
street" who has an automatic reflex action of vulgar zhdanovist horror,
when confronted with contemporary writing.... Since as an activist i've
hung out with such people all my life, i see the utility in this, i
guess.. But this rather hectic way of starting each analysis with an
acknowledgment of the supposed "difficulty" of our finest contemporary
poets strikes me as...well, quaint.  Anyone interested enuff to be reading
Naylor is probably also bright enuff to begin grappling with real poetry
by herself.. In some respects we should be past the point of having to
apologize for good writing..

(More substantively:  the intro seems OK, though not earth-shaking...but
the chapter on Howe says little new, it seems to me:  the way in which she
builds her work around the voices of the dispossessed of history, has
already been much commented on, by her and by many others..)

This is not to dismiss Tom's point:  it seems a mildly valuble book; &
highly visible discussions of our best contemporary poets, are to be
encouraged, *especially* from university presses, who are usually so firm
in their across-the-board commitment to dreck

"EX" a multimedia performance

music by Mike Higgins

words & video by Jason Brooks

choreography by Michelle Fenner

October 20, 1999
8pm
St. Mary's Church (3912 Locust Walk)
Philadelphia

"EX" will be a kind of sensory overload rooted in the revolution fantasies
of the Romantics with some help from Dole Pineapple, William Blake, and
manically depressed Arab emigrates.  Yes, yes, sexy indeed...

MIKE HIGGINS is a composer from Liverpool (UK) and is very much into Pierre
Boulez and Thomas Bernhard.  His work is usually very minimal and can span
up to 20 hours. Is he avant garde?  Well, what does that mean anyway?

JASON BROOKS is a poet and Philadelphia native.  He used to write
pornographic punk-type stuff, but doesn't do that anymore.  Some of his work
will be published by Head Hunter Press's "Lambs for the Sacrifice Anthology"
this winter.

MICHELLE FENNER is from San Francisco and is the newest member of Temple
University's graduate Dance Program.  She has toured the US and Europe with
various companies. She is also a master (or is it mistress ?) of
improvisation.

And "to think" means what, nowadays? Eliot liked to say D.H. Lawrence could
not be accused of thinking, of having a thought; I guess he thought
Lawrence's mental activity was mere will to organize sense impressions or
politico-sexual platforms? In any case Mark's view of the critic as
prescriptive sounds like a good possibility for criticism but we gotta read
miranda rights to the article he uses -- as long as we're on the "A POETICS"
list -- now over on the B+ POETICS list it's another story.

But Mark, what about the possibility of a genuinely sociological criticism,
anthropological even, investigating the set of beliefs (manners, fetishes,
however you want to label the learned-behavior) in the background of the
work? Like, to know that Hopkins and Merce Cunningham were in Olson's head
as much as the more obvious influences of Pound Yeats and WCW. And to know
about where he grew up, and what his politics were, and what rules he was
laying down -- so that we don't have to judge him by, say, Edwardian, or
high modernist standards?

Just some, em, ur, thoughts?

Dan Raphael expressed this to the list, neglecting to capitalize his name
properly, which I hate and hope something can be done about but I'll
overlook because he's onto a major issue here:

"I've been waiting for someone else to speak up about sondheim's all too
often "poetry" posting to this list. It seems he just views this list as a
place to post whatever comes off his typewriter."

right on with the censorship idea! we can't let this list become prey to
those who wish to post to it. we are caught up all the time with stuff, gobs
of stuff. we need less stuff. we need to cut back. the heretics are ruining
the garden, everything is so bad. I'm being oppressed. there are children
everywhere. people are talking. it was really rainy yesterday. I can't take
it anymore. Alan Sondheim keeps writing stuff, and it's not "real" poetry.
it's stuff that just came off his typewriter, as opposed to the other kind.
what right does he have? let us band together, I mean it, and demand that
Alan stop posting stuff from his typewriter because if he doesn't we're
going to have to learn how to use the delete button, and I for one am much
too busy for that.

Using your delete key is an option you may wish to exercise if you don't
like what someone shares.

Some of us enjoy Alan's writing and his zeal at least enough not to want to
insult him publicly or discourage others who may wish to be just as
enthusiastic about their own writings.  As in all things (the wisdom of
post-crit?) it's all just a matter of taste.

Maybe more people could post their own writing to the list.

Maybe less people would advertise their pubs with the typical roll calls of
names of writers.

Again, a matter of taste.

But then again this is a moderated list, so maybe my opined gape means
little.

NO NO NO!

I, though also largely a lurker, view Sondheim's posts as an integral and
indispensable pattern of fabric in the overall weave of this list.  To a
considerable (though of course partial) degree, they _are_ the list.  Any
legislation imposed on this generously continual contribution would be
destructive and wrongheaded, in my opinion.  I'd feel this way even if I
felt that there _were_ some truth to the claim that these posts were
sometimes just "whatever comes off [Sondheim's] typewriter."  That this
claim seems to me to be perverse only intensifies my feeling.

Of course it's important to exercise discretion in keeping the list at some
sort of manageable economy, but does this economy really necessitate the
curtailment of what has become a distinguishing mark of the list's
_character_ (and if I here seem to invoke a concept that is for some
uncomfortably akin to notions of "voice," "inviduality," etc., oh well!)?

have been trading myself right out of stock lately.  But I like the stuff

It seems that both Dobyns and Hejinian sell more or less similarly in
poetry sales (which I think might complicate the marginal v. mainstream
set up).

Dobyns Velocities: New and Selected Poems sold 9,421 copies as of August
of 1999 (a single title such as Dobyn's Body Traffic sold 3,066);
Hejinian's My Life has sold around 8,000 copies as of September 1999
(Sun & Moon edition only; Burning Deck edition sold out but I don't know
the print run on that). I don't have stats on other Hejinian titles but
imagine they are less.

Although one thing to consider is that Dobyns's Velocities was published
in 1994. Hejinian has accumulated those sales over a much a longer time.
It might take some more time to actually straighten out the sales
similarities. Who knows though if Velocities will get the long term
spread of sales that My Life has.

Still seems like an interesting similarity considering the muscle of
Penguin v. Sun & Moon and also there must be significant spin off sales
b/c of Dobyns's other writings that make his poetry sell better. (He
seems to be the best selling Penguin poet.)

Lisa Samuels has an article written shortly after (it seems) Beach's
where she complains about the canonization of My Life in MLS.

I'm looking forward to reading the Beach.

I disagree with Dad Raphael when he writes that Allan Sondheim posts to
the list “too often”. A discussion of this topic will perhaps go the
core function or definition of the list's objectives, which could be
interesting.

Sondhiem’s postings can be interesting to highly engaging on an
individual basis and, on a broader more conceptual basis, bring up
implications for the use of the list or for the use of the internet that
have a good bit of vitality and relevance.

I certainly discourage any attempt by the list oversight people to
censor or control this type of posting activity.

I'm not sure I understand the question.  I _do_ think that
Beach's analysis is
dismissive of the real issue of audience.  In fact, his analysis
of Dobyns's
audience is wholly dismissive: it is a "built-in academic
audience of more than
three hundred creative writing programs" (59).  While a few
gestures are made
toward what reviewers have to say about Dobyns, or more often
what they do not
say: "reviewers seldom speak about his use of form, if they
mention it at all."
(61)

What unsympathetic readers might do with Dobyns -- or other
mainstream poets --
is an interesting sociological question.  I imagine the
anti-mainstream focus
of much alternative poetics could be the subject of a pretty cool
study.  But
that's not what Beach examines; rather, it's what he exemplifies.

Not a total analysis, no.  But there could be a variety of ways
of getting
closer -- surveys of workshop participants, close analysis of the
terms of
positive reviews without snide dismissals of those same reviews,
etc.

It' much more than footnotes.  It's in the introduction, it's all
over Chapter
2.

I presented my view of Beach's article pretty harshly, more
harshly than I
would put it in a professional review.  In view of the crap
that'sout there
posing as poetry criticism, Beach's work is a positive good -- in
fact, I think
from my cursory reading that the slam stuff is excellent.

Excellent question.  Bourdieu's notion of the "fetish" owes a lot to Marx,
natch, but also plugs in to his own concept of a "circle of belief," in this
case the "believers" in poetry or those who benefit from that belief.  (Literary
critics, for example.)  I don't mean to use PB like a sacred text, but a lot of
what you have said here seems well addressed by another passage in the Field of
Cultural Production:

"The ideology of creation, which makes the author the first and last source of
the value of his work, conceals the fact that the cultural businessman (art
dealer, publisher, etc.) is at one in the same time the person who exploits the
labor of the "creator" by trading in the "sacred" in the person who, by putting
it on the market, by exhibiting, publishing or staging it, consecrates a product
which he has "discovered" and which would otherwise remain in your natural
resources; and more consecrated he personally is, the more strongly consecrates
the work.  The art trader is not just the agent who gives the work a commercial
value by bringing it into a market; he is not just the representative, the
impresario, who "defends the authors he loves."  He is the person who can
proclaim the value of the author he defends (cf. the fiction of the catalogue or
blurb) and above all "invests his prestige" in the author's cause, acting as a
"symbolic banker" who offers as security although symbolic capital he has
accumulated (which he is liable to forfeit if he backs a "loser").  This
investment, of which the accompanying "economic" investments are themselves only
a guarantee, is what brings the producer into the cycle of consecration.
Entering the field of literature is not so much like going into religion as
getting into a select club: the publisher is one of those prestigious sponsors
(together with preface-writers and critics) who effusively recommend their
candidate.  Even clearer is the role of the art dealer, who literally has to
"introduce" the artist and his work into ever more select company (group
exhibitions, one-man shows, prestigious collections, museums) and ever more
sought-after places.  But the law of this universe, whereby the less invisible
the investment, the more productive it is symbolically, means that promotion
exercises, which in the business world take the overt form of publicity, must
here me euphemized. The art trader cannot serve his "discovery" unless he
applies all his conviction, which rules out "sordidly commercial" maneuvers,
manipulation and the "hard sell," in favor of the softer, more discreet forms of
"public relations" (which are themselves a highly euphemized form of publicity)
-- receptions, society gatherings, and judiciously placed confidences."  (76-7).

Well, sure.  Everybody does that already.  And insofar as Beach proclaims his
own differences with Dobyns, I have no problem with his readings.  It's when
Beach substitutes "the reader" or "we" for his own voice and basically erases
the difference between a close reading and a sociological engagement that I
find

Why not?  Since he frames his work as, in part, a literary sociology: a work
that addresses "literary production and reception," that "attempts to provide
some kind of comprehensive or analytical study of poetry as a sociocultural
phenomenon."  Yet the reception of Dobyns is of no concern to Beach.

That's a false dichotomy: "framing arguments regarding what he thinks poetry
ought to be doing" versus "just render[ing] passive evaluation on execution,
defer[r]ing to rules laid down by the poet."  In fact, I contributed to that
false dichotomy by framing the "consequence" of Beach's position in terms of
what Dobyns thinks.  More properly, what Dobyns's readers _do_ with Dobyns is
the (sociological) point at issue.

Mark, why do you lay down the "critic's task" in such prescriptive terms?  If
Beach wants to act as a critic in the terms you're laying out, fine -- but
it's the way criticism (aesthetics) _always_ trumps sociology in this chapter
-- the way sociology is just an excuse for another close reading -- that gets
me.

Awhile back I posted an announcement of Ezra Pound's induction into the
Poets Corner at St John the so-called Divine in New York scheduled for
later this week. Here's the latest news from Tim Redman (I asked permission
to forward this):

>I was informed by Omar Pound that Ezra Pound's installation in the
>Poet's Corner of St. John the Divine has been denied by the bishop.
>Evidently, a petition was circulated among parishioners protesting
>the decision by the Electors and threatening a demonstration.

Anybody know any cardinals? Sylvester

     David:

     Thanks for the tip.  I did contact Mary Ann Caws, and she briefly
     replied that she has written about/referenced Phillips in the past.
     Once I get more details, I'll send out a message to the list for those
     who are interested.  She also told me that she is currently working on
     another essay about his work, which will be published in an
     "avant-garde mag" (?), but no other details forthcoming yet...

As far as i know Mary Ann Caws up at CUNY has written some essays on
Phillips, though i'm not sure where they are located.  It's a starting
point thought.

Small Press Traffic Reading
David Buuck and Brian Kim Stefans
Friday, October 22, 7:30 p.m.

When people ask, what's really new in poetry, we always give a name or two,
and one is David Buuck's. His tentative, exacting poetry can be brutal at
times; its enveloping structures want to pack the whole world in a
suitcase, then fling it away. There is the constant questioning, abasement,
loneliness; a concomitant beauty is born. David Buuck lives in San
Francisco, where he co-edits Tripwire: a journal of poetics with Yedda
Morrison. He is a 1999 Artist-in-Residence at the Headlands Center for the
Arts in Marin. His poetry, prose, & essays appear or will appear in Object,
Outlet, Torque, Lyric&, h2so4, Impossible Object, 5_Trope, Situation, and a
new chapbook from Melodeon. This fall he enters the History of
Consciousness Program at UCSC.

This will be Brian Kim Stefans' first reading in San Francisco, and we've
been trying for a year to get him here. The formal experimentation that
characterized 70s and 80s "Language Poetry" is here, alive and blooming,
but with a pop-culture injection of speed, interface, dynamism, wit. Brian
Kim Stefans is the author of Free Space Comix (Roof Books, 1998), Gulf
(Object Editions, 1998) and co-author (with Sianne Ngai) of The
Cosmopolitans ("Interlope," issue 2). His graphic and interactive poetry
can be found at www.ubu.com, and the on-line poetry journal he edits,
Arras, is at www.bway.net/~arras. Criticism is forthcoming in Talisman. He
works as Associate Project Coordinator in the web department at Fodor's
Travel. When people ask, what's really new in poetry, we always give a name
or two, and one is Brian Kim Stefans'.

Listees:

I was wondering if anyone has the submission guidelines for APR's
Honickman award.  Creeley is judging it this year.

They ask for a self-addressed envelope for guidelines; and sometimes even
this doesn't work to get the information.

If anyone could help out with this info, backchannel would probably be
best, I'd much appreciate it.

Isn't that the exact thing we do here; this list is a place to post whatever
comes off our typewriters, be it this very post, a notice that poetry
readings are being held in a city on the other side of the planet, a work of
poetry/poetics, or critical commentary? I don't know how long Sondheim sits
on his work before he sends it to this list, but it is part of a greater
whole, as I'm sure you'd have seen from his periodic notices. I must admit
that very often it is incomprehensible, and that is an utterly refreshing
change from the thousands of comprehensible posts which make their fleeting
appearances in my filters and end up written over when I empty my trash.
Sondheim is one of the few people whose work I keep: looking at my poetics
inbox, AH Bramhall, John Lowther, Miekal And, David Bromige, Ron Silliman
dominate amongst the other men and women of this list for the frequency of
appearance of their names. As a lurker, you've only just revealed your
presence, and you do so with a criticism, as did I, I must admit. I don't
know, it just seems facile to criticise someone for posting whatever comes
off their typewriter. This just came off my own typewriter

should I sit here for a while longer before I posted it? I don't know,
that's at my discretion, isn't it?

It's a beautiful day outside so I'll just go out and take some panacea from
nature. Just one more thing I would like to say: on a poetics list, why is
there not more poetics and poetry? The event reviews, the event notices, the
book reviews and commentary are excellent, but where's the poetics? I'm too
nervous to post my own for the very reason that it has just come off my
typewriter and I need to reflect on what I just said before I decide it is
worthy. That's a personal thing. Alan clearly thinks his work is worthy of
distribution, who is to say he hasn't thought about it before hitting send?
and I hit send.

        {poetix}

a few weeks ago i made a tape --- some 70 minutes of a possible 90 --- me
reading the entire book _Words_ by creeley --- it was interesting to do ---
to try to get in a reading, singular, something of the complexity that one
finds in reading any poem of his --- i have that exact change yearbook with
cd and so i had two exempla of his reading style to think about tho,
ultimately, my taping doesnt sound too much like how i imagine r.c. wd have
read these

since then this tape has been in my car player looping continually --- and
this being atlanta i spend altogether too much time in that damned car ---
but the tape has been a joy i feel like i know this whole book of poems much
much better than my previous several-many readings of it had tuned me to ---
last night i went back and looked at the text for the 1st time since the
recording and the effect is very palpable, that i now know whole passages
almost by heart

and it isnt that my readings are so brilliant --- in listening to the tape i
hear in various places that i've missed a nuance by placing a certain stress
here and not there or that something is, due to my reading, off-balance in a
way that's not as interesting, or even, balanced in a way that i think wasnt
felt, intended etc...

do other folks ever do this sort of thing ?  i know my friend mark does as
that's partially what suggested to me that i might make this tape --- just
curious

"But you're not *supposed* to understand art.. You're supposed to
understand *culture.*  Culture is mutual understanding.  That is not
communication.  Communication is what I have in my music, with myself.
Communication is when people don't understand each other.  Because then
there is a consciousness level that is being brought out of you, where an
effort is made."

The new issue of Riding the Meridian
Sound/Text Hypertext Text/Text
is now online at:  http://www.heelstone.com/meridian

The Sound/Text Hypertext Text/Text issue of Riding the Meridian was
conceived to demonstrate just how much the act of being a poet has been
influenced by the Internet in terms of creating and distributing new
literary efforts.

The work some multimedia poets are doing on the Net has strong roots,
stretching into the language poetry community -- into the field of early
concrete poetry.  Alaric Sumner's section on Sound/Text showcases the
talents of seminal contributors to those genres, in the work of Bob
Cobbing, Lawrence Upton, John Cayley, Caroline Bergvall and Charles
Amirkhanian, among others, while Christy Sheffield Sanford and Jennifer
Ley have tapped the field of talent in hypermedia, bringing works by
writers like Annie Abrahams, M.D. Coverley and Stephanie Strickland,
Deena Larsen and Talan Memmott to show the spectrum of work being
created in hypertext.  Mark Bernstein, president and chief scientist of
Eastgate Systems, Inc., talks about the early days of hypertext and the
software he wrote to create it, Storyspace.

And, as the talents of pure text poets should not be seen to be
overshadowed by this internet explosion of visuals and sounds, we've
collected a group of text works highlighted by a selection of poems by
David Weinstock from his new collection, Physical Findings. CK Tower has
interviewed Alan Kaufman to gain insight into the current Spoken Word
phenomenon and Chocolate Waters has brought us Realaudio by New York
Spoken Word poet, Mark Larsen.

if this isnt exactly what is usually called _criticism_ it is close to what
I understand as making significant use of a poetic text, getting to know it,
like learning - for instance - a piece of music

Subject:      THE PRESIDENT-MACHINE
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

First - I do want to thank people who wrote in my defense. My work is
directly concerned with contemporary poetics; it's also hardly something
that appears out of my typewriter, but for better or worse is edited and
re-edited obsessively (in fact I just led a discussion on trAce about
editing).

Second - The piece below is part of a series of small plays or dialogs
that Foofwa I'mobilite and I, with others, will be producing; you can find
these at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/diary/le.txt if you're
interested. After Heiner Muller it has been difficult to write; these use
or reference back to the 1938 Moscow show trials, and something in the
writing, at least for me, remains at stake. I live in Giuliani territory
and know the signs (which were there before Giuliani for that matter). The
first of these plays or dialogs had already been sent to Poetics.

Third - The work is going well at trAce, and there have been some really
beautiful and exciting contributions to "Yours"; I'd encourage you again
to go to http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/index.htm and partici-
pate. There are also the ongoing conferences at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk -
the most recent still being Psychology and Writing - and the discussions
have been excellent I think. ("Yours" is the replacement for the "Love and
War" piece, which had grown enormous, and is now in a "writing museum"
accessible through the index.htm.)

And Fourth - I want to thank the readers on this list in general for their
generosity; I'd also like to see more work presented here that deals with
Poetics - from a point of view _within_ poetry or other literary forms,
complementing the work already from the position of critique or dialog.

- Alan

I just wanted to say that, to me, "what comes off sondheim's
typewriter" is among the most thrillingly unusual and provocative
labor (labor as in the creation of value and as in labor of love) in
American poetry.

Excuse me but I am posting a review of my book from articlemagazine.com.
Thank you for your understanding! __ Elizabeth

  "These two boys were standing on the corner. A woman
  came around the corner. There was plate glass in windows.
  One of the boys saw her and his first reaction was to have
  lustful thoughts. She knew that and she looked at him
  gently and look, the other boy couldn't believe it, but there it
  was. His companion had turned into a pile of maggots." (9)=20

  Thus opens Elizabeth Treadwell's Populace , a book of
  "Highly Sorted Detail(s)" and "varied kind(s) of silence,"
  safety-pinned purses where things are kept and apartments
  with TVs, terry cloth frogs, outfitted closets, where "There
  were reasons for our behavior but we weren't privy" (41).
  Treadwell's texts gracefully and resolutely refuse to uphold
  the false binaries between poetry and prose, narrative and
  fragmentation, truth and lie, autobiography and fiction,
  analysis and experience, stylish and frumpy. Whether
  remembered or imagined, these experiences, in this world,
  are plausible, difficult, worthy of the scrutiny Treadwell
  invites us to subject them to. In this book we walk in a
  beautiful, uncomfortable world, to the steadily syncopating
  rhythms of daily troubles, daily joys, the unusual usual that
  makes the complexity of a life lived, or of one written. In the
  practice of photography, portraits of city life often tend to
  exemplify an idea rather than a subject.=20

  "Identity as a question becomes nearly too stupid (dumbly
  mesmerizing) when the meadow is so comfortable. How
  can we be polite. Danger. No trespassing. In the era of
  simple, lucid flesh. This may all be exed out and
  reattempted. Twins with the same name, Mary, and Eve,
  who wanted to experience. I own a dictionary of terms and
  theory, she asserted just recently. The present moment can
  be a hardship." (62)=20

  And is a hardship, though perhaps a chosen one (and
  perhaps not), as these texts move through deaths, mental
  institutions, relationships of all kinds (from friendships to
  incests to loves to incidental acquaintances), schools,
  parties, interiors and exteriors of narrators who "walk in
  empty streets carrying his face or is it my own in my
  hands" (60). Though partaking of elements of the
  fantastic-or maybe she really did turn him into a pile of
  maggots!=97and certain familiar elements of certain
  contemporary worlds, Treadwell is not writing melodramatic
  tragedy with a capital T, nor is she engaging in the post
  prozac post-feminism post-everything nineties fluff that
  presumes to pass for prose writing.=20

  Reader, you may feel that a hardworking actress (and a
  nineties woman) should be defined by something other than
  the inventory of her closet, and you would normally be right,
  but bear with me. There's a reason for these style notes.
  Your heart may rule your head in the early days of
  December, but common sense will prevail" (55). Treadwell
  is, rather, telling our fortune, writing a new realism,
  populated, placed, accurate as experience is accurate, that
  is, changeable and complicated and contradictory and
  kaleidoscopically specific.

  Populace is the feeling of a day and then another day, days
  which descend in no particular order, words caught behind
  the crows in eyes and inside the day, inside the eyes,
  under the dress, and about the dress: there is a story,
  "inside furniture is a story" (18) which tells itself whether or
  not we listen=97things here having a life, as well as making
  up a life=97as Treadwell listens, incites our listening: "Listen
  to the narrative, it spills widely (None of this makes up for
  the page where she broke off, plus it's all lies)" (61).=20

  Treadwell's widely spilling narratives, her "lies," her
  sentences and lines and fragments and accumulations,
  propose not only to engage us through narrative, sensory,
  mental and emotional means what we might call "story,"
  but also to map out (in the sense of exploration rather than
  conquest) certain compelling terrains=97both within the world
  and within language=97that serve to complicate what at first
  might seem to be a quick, pleasurable view into the lives of
  this book's populace. So, for example, in a paragraph where
  we are located "on Oxford. in bright concrete. next door
  there was Safeway."=97information which actually pertains to
  the actual city of Berkeley=97where our "i" shopped in this
  strange hat my sister and i shared. hair was dirty. chose
  lemons." the final sentence reads "that was when i." (37)

  Treadwell's sense of rhythm, of what is possible and what is
  not possible, of breath and pause, complicates her texts so
  that in the space of one sentence fragment she raises
  questions of the very "I" used throughout the book, of when
  and why it is possible to say "I" (and when and why it isn't),
  of what the "I" does and doesn't do, of ways to represent
  events in narrative and leave the narrative and the events
  open at the same time.

  Populace stakes out regions, geographical, emotional,
  stylistic territories within whose borders Treadwell's
  sentences collide against one another and themselves,
  borders which might seem to function primarily to define
  places-Berkeley, Los Angeles, Oakland, Hollywood,
  Susanville, 7-11, a house, a mental institution, a school, a
  street,a dinner party, a dressing room=97but which
  constantly, with the inconsistency of experience, explode
  any stability the mapmaker might have thought she desired.
  Treadwell uses her sentences to populate a definite sense
  of place:

  i moved from berkeley to l.a. i moved away from l.a. after i
  broke up. in between a foreign country. but i only wanted to
  say i went to karin's dinner party (20).

  Eucalyptus. That's where I live (44).

  i go down rounded escalators, recalling a recent celebrity
  profile in the Chronicle that featured these very environs. In
  the BART station I pass a movie ad featuring a vaguely
  remembered lover, an actor who once munched my puss
  (13).

  Associations with specific towns and places, the "several
  overlapping sidewalks" of curious, frustrated, hungry young
  North Americans are inevitable in Populace ("...these are
  memories, in which meaning has been compounded and
  withdrawn," 55) so that Treadwell's "I" is not just a shifting,
  expanding character in these texts, but is also me, you, us.
  Once we are inhabiting these texts=97"He wasn't just looking
  at it he was in it then" (46)=97its populations, places, words
  inhabit us. The distance between "reader" and "writer,"
  "read and "written," "narrative" and "experience" closes and
  widens like the view from Alcatraz Avenue in Berkeley,
  where the funnel of storefront-lined, bicycle-treaded avenue
  pours out into the bay, the prison-cum-museum island, the
  bridge behind=97 "Gateway to the Pacific"=97 or to
  something), the view widening, narrowing, lengthening,
  shortening as the fog slides over the water twice daily.
  Treadwell's works are "set rightly to overlook / abandoned
  prison tourist attract / mercilessly as the waves there / the
  little waves of this bay our home / our situation / also that of
  tiger sharks" (22)

  These texts map out terse sentences ("i catch the plane
  back. next to me there is a little boy. there are trees on that
  street so the air is nice. when i get home i am home"
  (17-18) and lengthy accumulations connected by commas
  and threads of thought and feeling, paragraphs which range
  and paragraphs which contain, concise portraits and
  refracting, expanding biographies. This is "regional writing"
  in that it is definitely located, though not definitively placed,
  and in that it demarcates experiential regions, terrains
  where things and people happen, where "i am visiting. there
  are old friends attaching to other people and times. there is
  now" (15), borders within which there are "how many bright
  new centers of electricity" (67), which then act to dissolve
  the borders, re-form them to create further narrative,
  populated and empty at the same time: "Feed not on logic.
  I was in a foreign place. There were two towns that could be
  separated by name or put together by name" (10).

  Absence and unity in absent unity, bound and unbound in
  the unbound book, the populated emptiness of distances
  closing up while also being kept apart, distance playing
  itself like its own instrument, distance. Texts which walk
  the edge between "here" and "there" never falling heavily on
  one side or another but slipping, a foot here, a foot there,
  edges made to outline the nothing between them: "see how
  it's hollow. patching" (16). A patched, hollow space held
  open for the text and its inhabitants (linguistic, human,
  humane) to escape out towards us, or for us to enter, to
  walk through the shifting terrains of language and
  experience this book makes possible. The portrait called
  "Polly" ends "I guess I'll be here forever now, however long
  or short that may be" (32). Populace itself ends without
  ending, with a forever invitation, however long or short that
  may be, back into the text:

  the girl held her book open, asking him, on the stylized
  school stoop, forever. (67)=20

1) Maybe i should have back channeled to sondheim asking him about his work.

2) why would the same people championing alan's right to express himself on
the list blast me for expressing myself. they sy the list is for exchanging
ideas and get dont get up in arms about me.

3) i do not favor censorship. i was not asking the list meister to limit
sondheims posting, but asking alan to consider the frequency of his positng
in lieu of the list's limited time and reader's time as well. unlike several
of the people who back-channeled me i get my list in digest form and cannot
delete posts on sight. i do read through everything that's sent me.
[there's always a lot of back-channel discussion. no one posted to the list
in favor of my opinion, tho i received several back channels in support, as
i suppose alan did]

4) but back to differences of opinions. some say that's what the list is
for. and i suppose i should craft some moreciritcal reasons why i dont think
reading most of alan's postings is worth my time. maybe even a reason
critical argument would go against what some people see as the list's range
ofitnerests/behaviors, since we dont see much heated discussion

5) lets see more poems by more people. lets' see more opinons about poems,
more poetics & elss personalities. or maybe all of the above

Some of you may know that Amazon Bookstore has been a feminist location for
years in Minneapolis, long before Jeff Bezos appropriated the name for his
website. Predictably, this has led to a fight in the courts over ownership
of the name.
The following is from Holt Uncensored, an excellent e-mail letter by Pat
Holt
for the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association.

What follows below is Pat's column and commentary on the unsubtle uses of
homophobia in its legal defense. Given how many small press web sites offer
links to the Bezos/Amazon site, which has already gained a reputation for
not
fulfilling orders from small presses (instead just telling the buyers that
it is
o.p.), I think it's worth considering just who you are doing business with.

AMAZON V. AMAZON:
     SEX, LIES AND DEPOSITIONS

So here's the scene: One of the five owners of Amazon Bookstore in
Minneapolis - the oldest feminist bookstore in the country - is being
deposed by lawyers representing Amazon.com, the online bookseller based in
Seattle -   when a very strange thing happens.

Q (AMAZON.COM LAWYER): Have you had any particular interest in feminism?
A (AMAZON BOOKSTORE CO-OWNER): Yes.
Q: Dating back to when?
MR. SAMUEL (Amazon Bookstore lawyer): Objection, Vague.
A. I don't know. I don't remember.
Q. Seventies, college, before?
A. Possibly.
Q. Have you had any interest in promoting lesbian ideals in the community?
MR. SAMUEL: Object to the question as vague. Also it's completely
irrelevant.
A. I don't know exactly. Can you be a little clearer?
Q. I'll ask you this, are you gay? [To Mr. Samuel] And let me say this,
Matt, you know the objections. I understand you have a job to do, and I'm
going to ignore you for the rest of the deposition . . .

Good heavens. As you may remember (see #80), Amazon Bookstore (founded in
1970) is suing Amazon.com (founded in 1995) for trademark infringement. The
Minneapolis bookstore contends that it has lost money for years because of
confusion created by customers and vendors who mistake Amazon Bookstore for
Amazon.com. Attempts by Amazon Bookstore to find a peaceful solution through
talks with Amazon.com were rebuffed, they say, and they sued.

So now: What does sexual orientation have to do with trademark infringement?
Let's get back to the deposition after a number of objections and
discussions have followed.

Q: In 1987, was the purpose of the entity for which you worked to just sell
books for profit?
A: We sell books to stay in business for a profit, yeah. I guess I would say
that.
Q: You sell books, but has the purpose remained the same since 1987?
A: The purpose is - has been to sell books.
Q: Nothing else?
A: Not in my opinion.
Q. Okay. . . Are any of the employees at the Bookstore gay, and forgive me
for asking this question.
MR. SAMUEL: I'm going to object to the question as irrelevant. Calls for
speculation.
A: You're asking me to speculate on my coworkers' sexuality, is that the
question?
Q: I'm asking if you know.

And here the Amazon.com lawyer inserts what is to him an analogy that will
explain all.

Q: I think, for example, if I tell people or introduce them to my wife and
tell them this is my wife, I'm married to her, if somebody asks me if I'm
married or asks somebody else to whom I've just introduced my wife whether
I'm married, that person can say yeah, he's married, to my knowledge to a
woman.
So I'm asking you if you know if any of the individuals that you work for
are gay to your knowledge.

MR. SAMUEL: Counsel, that's an absurd comparison, and you know that. You're
not asking - you can ask her if any of the women at the Bookstore are
married.
Q: You accused me of stereotypes. What's the difference of being married to
a man or woman? Essentially, that's what I'm asking. Do you know if any of
the women at the Bookstore, are any of the women at the bookstore married to
a woman?
A: It's not legal to be married to a woman.
Q: Do they have partners?

We don't know from this public record if everyone laughed out loud at the
Amazon.com's lawyer's confusion over what his wife is doing in a story
that's supposed to elicit answers about gay identity.

But let's give some points to the Amazon Bookstore co-owner for helpfully
pointing out something he should know as a lawyer - that women can't be
married to one another. Why
she doesn't bonk him on the head with a law book is a puzzlement.

And what any of this has to do with trademark infringement is a mystery.
Could it be that Amazon.com has no defense, and its lawyers know it?

Ah, but the next day the Amazon.com lawyer is fresh and anxious to do the
right thing as he begins deposing another co-owner of Amazon Bookstore, to
whom he shows a document.

Q: You see in the E-mail it states, all the owners at this time of Amazon
Bookstore Cooperative and historically have been all lesbians. Do you see
that?
A: No. Where is that?
Q: Is that an accurate statement, to your knowledge? I don't mean to ask a
personal question, and I apologize for doing so.
MR. SAMUEL: Yeah. Just hold on for a second. . .
(OBJECTIONS AND OFF-THE-RECORD DISCUSSIONS FOLLOW)
Q: Do you know whether any of the current owners or employees of Amazon
Bookstore Cooperative are partners?
MR. SAMUEL: Same objection . . . this question is invasive, and it's clearly
irrelevant. (MORE OBJECTIONS)

Finally the Amazon.com lawyer decides to state why he thinks the question is
relevant. He stops the proceedings and says the following:

"I think it's important, as I said yesterday, that a jury understands how
Amazon Bookstore Cooperative represents itself to the public, and I think as
part of that, it's important for the jury to know, for example, whether the
people who work in the Bookstore have a particular sexual orientation
because obviously from the perspective of my client, we think that's
important to the case, the defense's case, and that is one of the grounds
for relevance."

You can skip the rest of his explanation, but in deference to what I think
he is trying to say I've transcribed it anyway:

"And on the question of whether people are partners, in deposing people,
and if we continue to depose employees at the Bookstore, I would certainly
like to know if they have a relationship with somebody else at the
Bookstore. And it would be more likely than not that they would have access
to the same information, similar to a man and a woman who are married."

Well, there he goes again (not listening to yesterday's witness, by the
way), though it's clear he's not comfortable with the line of questioning
and has one thing further to say:

"And, again, I don't take any pleasure in asking these questions, and from
my perspective, I ask them - to me, it's like asking somebody if they have
red hair. I don't particularly put a label on somebody because they have a
particular sexual orientation. To me if you're married, it doesn't matter if
you're married as a man and a woman, woman and woman or man and a man."

So that's very gracious of Amazon.com's lawyer, and we're sure the co-owners
of Amazon Bookstore, who had to sit through many days of questions and
assumptions
that were  just as irrelevant as these, felt a lot better when he explained
himself.

Meanwhile, it's worth looking at such testimony to appreciate why the court
makes these kinds of depositions public: If Amazon.com thinks it's playing
some
kind of hardball by disclosing the sexual identity and relationships of the
staff of Amazon Bookstore, we should know it.

And we should know that all of these questions are being asked not just by
some attorney fishing for bait he can use later but "from the perspective of
my client," which is to say the people who own and operate Amazon.com.

Can't you see some strategist in a back room somewhere suddenly looking as
if the light has dawned. Say, he says to himself, these women are dykes!  We
can't lose! Our 'defense' is proof they're a bunch of lezbos and we walk
away with the trial!

Otherwise, why ask how "the Amazon Bookstore Cooperative represents itself
to the public" when it's clear on every identifying statement made by that
store that it's a feminist bookstore?  Its website is
http://www.amazonFEMBKS.com  (emphasis mine).  Its purpose is the
same as every other independent bookstore in the country - to "sell books to
stay in business for a profit" as the co-owner testified. Of course it
sells a lot of lesbian books - so does Amazon.com!

To Matt Samuel, the Amazon Bookstore lawyer who appears to be getting madder
and madder during the depositions, "this line of questioning by Amazon.com
borders on the outrageous," as he said on the phone yesterday. To stop it,
on October 8 he moved  for a protective order "to prevent Defendant
Amazon.com from inquiring into the sexual orientation or relationships of
any witness in
this case."

In this motion, Samuel makes the astute observation that
"under Amazon.com's view of the law, Amazon Bookstore could and should have
asked Amazon.com's President, Jeff Bezos, if he is gay or straight, and
whether he is sleeping with anyone in his company who also might be a
witness.

"One would think that both Mr. Bezos and his counsel would have taken
offense at this line of questioning, and refused to answer. The principals
of Amazon Bookstore are entitled to every bit as much respect and protection
from harassment as Mr. Bezos."

So come on, Jeff, one wants to say: Call off the dogs. This suit is a
legitimate attempt to determine trademark infringement. It's not about
anything else. If you think it is, you're not fighting fair. (And by the
way, have you ever had a boyfriend?)

Note: The hearing on this motion is set for October 27. Anyone who'd like to
contribute to the Amazon Bookstore Legal Defense Fund can send checks
to the store (Amazon Bookstore, 1612 Harmon Place, Minneapolis MI 55403.
Should Amazon Bookstore win or settle the suit, all donations will be
returned. You can also  buy AmazonNOTcom buttons ($2 each plus .75) or
t-shirts ($18 plus $4 shipping & handling) that say "I support the original
Amazon Bookstore. Since 1970" by contacting amazon@amazonfembks.com .

The questions over who does and/or does not "like" (the number of) Alan
Sondheim's posts suggest further questions, beyond taste, which point to
questions of authority, power and interceding actions on the part of those
capable of it, ie., forms of "censorship" obscured by these having obvious
"reasons."  Sondheim's posts

seem relatively "neutral" - that is, they don't introduce direct questions
concerning the authority of those who choose posts.  (In fact, any idea of
editing or censoring posts would be likely to invoke protests over just
representations of listee intent, uncomfortable accusations of prejudice,
pseudo-fascist ellipsis and what not, it being easier to simply let things
fly and/or sit as they are received.)  Is it possible

that a large number of inoffensive posts per month from an individual might
be allowed to "pass", while a similar number of more aggressive posts - ie.,
aggressive with respect to the presumptions underlying the general direction
and intent (and purpose) of the list as dictated, to some extent, by the
tastes and "beliefs" of the listees, as well as the list moderator - might
be cause for removal from the list for reasons of the sheer unassailable
conflict that might result?

One recalls here the removal of Henry Gould and Gabriel Gudding last year,
ostensibly for posting "too many messages", many of which were rather
adamantly and openly critical - and at times downright mocking - of a
particular "seriousness" to which many on the list seem otherwise intensely
devoted.  There probably IS an unspoken, undefined yet presumed "behavioral
standard" for those posting to the list, not least of which has to do with a
certain gravity of address, that what we're all involved with here is,
indeed, not to be called down by gauche cynicism or direct personal attack
that is not primarily directed toward "the question at hand", that being
objectified as what's called

The Work.  Yet isn't one of the many functions of The Work to point out the
slightly hilarious absence of the king's clothes, and the enormous balnk
gaps in comprehension of "a world" in which one is free to choose to leave
all sorts of claw-marks in the process of crawling always further into and
back out of what's always almost never quite there?  So with Sondheim, whose
posts are nothing if not the exact teeth-marks of the more-or-less ordinal
chewing swami.

But what of posts that push the envelope of the group's assumptions?
(ie., what ARE the group's assumptions?)  While it is quite natural for the
list moderator to want to put forth a list that is goodly liberal in its
appearance of fairness and openness, the question remains as to just how
tolerant s/he may be in the face of more direct questions as to the purpose
of the list, and who and what it is for - discussion, sure, but what can
come of what seems an endless series of come ups and put downs in the public
sphere, when

certain kinds of criticism are represssed by simply removing those in
question from the list?  While I'm not suggesting that this kind of quiet
censorship makes the list the equivalent of the Republican National
Convention, there ARE conventions operating behind the public presentation
of the list that might more usefully be brought into the open.  I recall a
story I heard this summer over dinner

during a break in the Boston Alternative Poetry Conference that neatly
points up this issue.  During mention of Douglas Rothschild's fine
performance earlier in the day, Bill Luoma noted that Douglas had had the
honor of being the first person kicked off the UB list for "a scathing post"
he had written and sent from Luoma's address.
While the message, I believe, was posted, it was also accompanied by an
angry phone call to Luoma from Charles Bernstein, who demanded that Luoma
never let Rothschild send a message from his (Luoma's) computer again.  So

there ARE obviously invisible ley lines and pressures operating behind the
UB list scene in order to build an agreeable presentation, though of course
in light of this story - are there others? - there is reason to question the
honesty and openness - if not the outright authority - of those whose
choices make the list whatever it continues to be.  Perhaps this might give
cause to wonder what that is, measured over against what it otherwise might
be.  While there may be no exact "destination" in this swimming towards what
we otherwise always have to put before us in order to be able to believe we
can "reach" it, is there also some truth to the fact that we, as listees, as
poets, and/or as persons are simply drowning in what we might take to be the
"lake of light" that may also be nothing more than our own conceit?  It
certainly seems a point (somewhere far ahead) worth asking, here, and now.

But Mark, what about the possibility of a genuinely sociological
criticism, anthropological even, investigating the set of beliefs
(manners, fetishes, however you want to label the learned-behavior) in the
background of the work? Like, to know that Hopkins and Merce Cunningham
were in Olson's head as much as the more obvious influences of Pound Yeats
and WCW. And to know about where he grew up, and what his politics were,
and what rules he was laying down -- so that we don't have to judge him
by, say, Edwardian, or high modernist standards?

Just some, em, ur, thoughts? Jordan


*******************

to which i reply:   I have no arguement with any of this..I think i agree
with it all...My original, rather intemperate, post, was in reply to the
idea that C. Beach only had the right to judge Stephen Dobyns from the
point of view of Dobyns' values and goals re poetry.  But if Beach is
bright enuff and careful enuff to understand what those values and goals
are,  (and i think he is, in his new book)  then he has the right (nay,
the duty!  he said, waving a pedagogic finger in the air....)  to say that
Dobyns' values and goals stink,  and are part of Dobyns' problem....

This is oversimplifying on a number of levels (not least, on the level of
dealing with Beach's discussion, which i found stimulating and
interesting...)  but for time reasons it's the best summation of my
position i can give,  and it does OK i believe....

This is a really interesting post....

I would only add, what JS alludes to at the end:  My Life is a very
special and unusual book, among counterstream works, and among Heninian's
work....  The really fair comparison would be Velocities to, say, The Cold
of Poetry, which is not a selected poems, but does collect a number of
major works published less accessibly over a period of time, and so has
some similarity.....

I don't think that the comparison of sales figures in that case,
would complicate "marginal vs. mainstream" nearly as much!

Mark prejsnar replies:  WHAT IS the real issue of audience?? It seems to

you give from the chapter above, .. seem to me like perfectly useful and

 In fact, I contributed to that false dichotomy by framing the

point at issue.

Mark, why do you lay down the "critic's task" in such prescriptive terms?
If Beach wants to act as a critic in the terms you're laying out, fine --
but it's the way criticism (aesthetics) _always_ trumps sociology in this
chapter -- the way sociology is just an excuse for another close reading
-- that gets me.

i only feel (maybe i'm just less rigorous and original than you, in
thnking about these issues...) that C. Beach has made an interesting start
toward siting some of the overall tension lines and creative currents on
the contemporary scene.... Despite many limitations in his book..

It sounds to me like you have some ideas of your own about how a sociology
of the poetry world would work.... Maybe (if you haven't) you should
publish 'em  (...or give us a citation, if they are partly out there
somewhere in print) ... i'm quite willing to believe that they would be
valuble, and wd. fill in the lacunae in Beach's work...

This is pretty fascinating... i think that maybe ol' Ez would suggest that
such a holy canonization was wildly and humorously inappropriate for
him.... He didn't have all that much use for Xianity..... (he seems to
have thought it was OK for keeping those peasants happy down on the farm,
in the "middle ages", but deeply disliked it as a living force..)

"Diseases of the Horse"

         Vesicular Stomatitis


a fever begins (skin),  sporadic and reemerging

Equine practitioner is walking fast and slow
or running    and falls from breath, from practicing.


Transmission:   endemic in warm    released
                by what’s hiding in deep
                grasses introduced by motion

a lesion blisters (virus),  swells and breaks

Veterinarian forces ideas of healing and infection
into the horse, the mouth, the nostrils, the coronary bands.

Human Risk:     sunlight destroys    risk and creates
                        risk and hauling and producing return
                        to horses then humans then horses

death occurs (sometimes),  and others live

Equine practitioner quarantines only the virus,
the virus and the horse parts attached.



"Diseases of the Horse"

The Strangles


An untreated foal is as precise

as a field of vaccines.  And the greening
fenced bottomland arbitrates the spread,

the change from moving. Horses want
to harbor the outbreak of Pneumonia, fertility
problems, Endometritis,  and the galloping

desire to cease. Only being healthy enough
to play host,  serve pathogens, and replace air.

With their abscesses come a period of hesitation,
an incubation, a rush of legs beginning
in a small corral. With respiratory distress

comes an understanding
that beyond this line of barbs is another fence.

In this severed prairie any contact creates
wind,  and the horses lose the abandon
to breath long before infection.

david, speaking specifically in terms of sociological analysis then:  it
strikes me that bourdieu is clearly off the mark in associating (so
directly, that is, in the excerpt you quote) the authorship function (in
literature) with what goes on in the art gallery (at least, here in the
u.s.)... i mean, if what we're after is a sociological treatment proper,
then we'd have to look more closely at the publishing conglomerates that
are emerging (and related small-press consolidations) over and against the
gallery network of production and distribution...

which is actually a way of promoting an article that i think begins to get
at precisely this 'distinction':  steve tomasula's "speaking through a veil
of dollars: the dialogue between art and literature," in the july/august
(1999) _new art examiner_... most valuable, in my view...

which is another way of saying that discussions of poetic production
generally benefit (as bourdieu suggests) from a consideration of other
(artistic) enterprises... but that the differences between reception of
visual art (e.g.) and poetry (e.g.) might be at least as significant as the
similarities...

interesting exchange... perhaps necessary? to add here that *critiquing*
_poetic culture_ (or whatever) is not quite the same as criticising it, and
that the former is a more complex and, i think, more worthy pursuit...

best,

Subject:      Re: Dobyns vs. Hejinian
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

As a former (and often at the time frustrated) student of Stephen Dobyns,
when he was teaching at Syracuse a decade ago, I just wanted to make a
couple points perhaps pertinent to the invective being thrown around.
Forgive me if I am restating things already said earlier in the thread that
I may have missed.

First, despite the disparity in sales between his fiction and poetry,
Dobyns -- at least when I was his student -- took his poetry much more
seriously (certainly compared to the detective novels, and even wrt the
more serious novels). This makes me view Juliana Spahr's comparison of
sales with a more interested eye than I might otherwise.

Second, I'll be a witness that he's certainly no friend of avant poetries,
and this was my main frustration as a student and advisee; I well remember
our verbal tussles over the validity of even as established a poet as
Ashbery's (!) work.

For opinions on what he thinks poetry should do and what it shouldn't, a
conscientous reviewer (I seem to have missed the original posting of this
thread, but none of the layers of quotes passed down into the thread I read
contain comments about this) had better read Dobyns' own essays on poetics
(there are several that I know of, mostly from the late 80s). While to some
degree they rehash decades-old notions of metaphor and image unlocking
otherwise ineffable emotional and abstract communication, they at least
position him in a way that allows a critic to not have to put words in his
mouth. (Which is always a Bad Thing.)

Anyhow, anyone who has read a good deal of Dobyns' poetry (which I did
while his student) knows that his project, whatever it is described as, is
clearly a vastly different one than someone like Lyn Hejinian. Dobyns works
on the level of tension between image and narrative, with an eye toward
subverting some of the image conventions of mainstream-MFA poetries, it
seems to me; he's significantly less concerned with form on the
word-sound-sentence level than any poet whose name would normally be
bandied about on this list. His poems often consist of
(didactically-leaning) surrealist parables meant to illuminate the
conceptual ruptures and assumptions of upper-middle class life, or at least
the ruptures and assumptions of an upper-middle class academic like Dobyns
himself.

Like the poems of his old colleague Ray Carver, Dobyns' poems sometimes
seem to be notes for stories-with-an-ironic-insight that never made it to
being fleshed out in prose. There's not necessarily anything wrong with
that, I guess, and I knew plenty of folks who thought Dobyns' poetry was
wonderful. But critiquing (and especially judging negatively) his work with
the tools usually applied to avant poetries is shooting fish in a barrel,
since many of the concerns addressed by that sort of apparatus is
irrelevant to his stated goals.

hi juliana, all,

  it's funny, i don't think of that essay as 'complaining' about the
canonizing of =my life= -- but i guess it does, sort of.  it's called
"eight justifications for canonizing =my life=" and it investigates why
=that book= is so acceptable, a palatable experimental work.  lyn & i
have had interesting talk and correspondence about the matter, about in
her words what it means to be "accused of being happy."  thus, she says,
her responsive work "happily," emerging in installments near you.

Ursinus College.   Visiting Assistant Professor of Creative Writing

Ursinus College invites applications for a Visisting Assistant Professor of
Creative Writing, for a term of one year, renewable for up to two
additional years, beginning in Fall 2000.  Poetry &/or playwriting
preferred.  Position carries a 3-course workload per semester, in creative
writing & composition.  Candidate must present quality creative work,
demonstrate excellence in teaching, & delight in working in a lively
undergraduate writing scene.  Ursinus is a highly selective,
co-educational, residential liberal arts college of 1200 students located
25 miles from Philadelphia.  Please send letter of application, c.v., three
letters of recommendation, & 20-page writing sample by Nov. 5 to Jon
Volkmer, English Dept., Ursinus College, P.O. Box 1000, Collegeville, PA
19426.  Preliminary interviews at MLA.  Ursinus College is an EEO/AA
Employer.  In keeping with the college's historic commitment to equality,
women & minorities are especially encouraged to apply.

---------------------------

ENGLISH DEPARTMENT JOB OPENINGS

1. Assistant Professor, tenure track, to teach Shakespeare and either
postcolonial literatures or British drama.   Contact Professor Carol Dole,
cdole@ursinus.edu

2. Visiting Assistant Professor of Crearive Writing (preferably poetry
and/or playwriting).  One-year position, renewable for two more years.
Contact Professor Jon Volkmer, jvolkmer@ursinus.edu


Ursinus College is a member of the Centennial Conference, along with Bryn
Mawr, Franklin & Marshall, Haverford, Johns Hopkins, Swarthmore and five
other exceptionally strong liberal arts colleges.  Over half of our 340
first-year students this year achieved high school rankings in the top ten
percent. In terms of minority recruitment, among the top eighty US News
liberal arts colleges in the country, only Oberlin, Swarthmore, Wellesley
and Wesleyan match or exceed Ursinus in percentage of African-American
students.  We are dedicated to diversity, both in student and in faculty
recruitment, and minority candidates are especially invited to apply.

The College is seeking to hire motivated faculty members who are eager to
combine their scholarly interests with teaching.  Because Ursinus College
faculty constitute a scholarly community that takes tremendous pride in the
individual achievements of our colleagues and students, we support faculty
scholarship with a number of programs, including early or junior leave for
assistant professors, summer research stipends, and travel grants.
Reflecting our educational philosophy that values personal interaction
among students and professors, we also strongly support undergraduate
research. Last year 33 of our students co-authored publications that
described collaborative faculty-student research and 111 students made
public presentations at undergraduate research conferences.

Finally, according to the visiting team of faculty who were here last year
for Ursinus' ten-year re-accreditation, there is solid evidence that
Ursinus works uncommonly well at producing students who are "articulate,
self-confident, and serious of purpose."  The team concluded:  "One comes
away from a visit to Ursinus inspired."   It is likely that candidates
would agree if they visited our campus.

I've done it a lot, beginning with the poetry of Wallace Stevens...and
moving on to other poets I wanted to "know" in a deeper way.  I find it
extremely valuable even before actually listening to the tape -- the actual
tape-creation forces me to slow down my reading, and involve myself
kinesthetically with the poetry, in a way that sliding my eyes over the page
can never do.  I think I have a touch of attention-deficit-disorder, to use
a pop-psycho term for "impatience" and "impulsivity," and sometimes the
thought that I have a larger purpose in creating a tape for later use forces
me to read longer and more attentively than I might otherwise do.  Then,
after all these benefits accrue, there's the bonus of looping the tape in
the car, where I spend too much time to waste.

Would we really have 50 messages per day if the server was up 7 days per
week instead of the three to four that seems now to be the case?

I heartily recommend the digest option (which I use) as well as setting up a
special hotmail (or similar) account just for Poetics (I do this also).

Self-restraint in sending messages is also a value.

Reminds me of the days when I told people to type out other people's poems
to read them better. So after many readings of Sheila Watson's great _The
Double Hook_ (novel) I sat and typed the whole thing out. Got a result
similar to what yr mentioning.

Now, I would advise this for people who dig _Paradise Regained_ or the
works of Robert Kelly.

we've been talking about this for years, marveling at the neo-frank brocade.
it's simply the dismembering of the original thing which we had in mind
anyway, now spent. that's all we did. we got involved in things that were
supposed to earn stuff, and so we set our sail. the imaginary monster: when
we investigated we learned it lived in a town with a great school system and
a fairly okay tax rate. do you recall the charge you felt, when you learned
that? someone kept time, thinking that was important. that is, they told you
they were on the job, whatever that entails. they got lax with certain
attributes, insisting everything has a bright chance. hey, we're grandees,
right? educated with plenty of pizzazz, and disinclined to bite on the
heartlessness that goes on out there, here, or wherever. we have nice
natures, basically. what interferences we face, well, nothing's free, right?
costs brim over, like the river I saw the other day. it was embarrassing to
see the water spread into the road and everywhere. think of dank cellars,
soggy backyards and market value adjustments. if you want to speak of a
Thing, there's one right there. a river overflowing its banks, that's so
anti what we're about. we have a course to run. notice this fishy milt all
over the place, does the equation want to handle that? we're asking
questions today but, close the doors, let things seep in quietly. much of
the slag has been removed to another district. today's rockets will have
something to say. they won't exactly create a tension unless asked by
quorum. oh how a quorum deserves love. the matter grinds us tiredly, sure,
shaping logics and spewing out a tremendous vacancy that can be studied,
along with every other college subject. so radical! let's bolt! bastards are
those who have withstood the logical banishment. anyone can claim a taste
from the source, as a matter of fact, but: it works with specific rules. one
must willingly take the reins and create community standards. that's the
picture, the cover charge, correct? haven't we been buzzing about this all
along? we started as children so let's include that logical background in
the picture. parlance fucks us over always, rather pleasurable really, and
there are careers ready to burn a blazing bright light. a proper
mystification would work well now, amongst the cantankerous great. not to
remain in that comfy blur, tho. we're just not drunk enough. our anger has
been used as a fuel for furtherance. I for one would like to touch that
furtherance, and chew a few leathery hearts, just for the damn exercise of
my whole anger. maybe it's the sweetie pie moonlight or the ding dong
logistic of saying what you mean but the camaraderie is just a map of lazy
fuck all. as in, specifically, aint there ever an edge slicing thru the
perfect pie? why waste time publishing the tiny steps that show that the
corral was a great idea? that's Quisling working overdrive. the career doesn
't want to live, it wants to be painted on a wall. great trophy! how did
middling learn to rule? munch on this reminder: we're living it. all night
long.

I'll agree.  It's a valuable book.  My critique has to do with the relations
between sociology and aesthetics (i.e., criticism as traditionally
conceived).  And most of the book is _much_ better than the Hejinian/Dobyns
chapter.  I learned a lot.

It's in the works (abstract at http://www.duke.edu/~kellogg/CV/research.htm).
Some early ideas were laid out in

"Literary History and the Problem of Oppositional Practice in Contemporary
Poetry." Cultural Critique 32 (1995-6): 153-186.

and

"Desire Pronounced and/ Punctuated: Lacan and the Fate of the Poetic Subject."
American Imago 52.4 (1995): 405-437.

But those were before I'd really read Bourdieu well.

First I'd like to apologize to Ron and others for flooding their mailboxes.
Please let me know backchannel if you think I'm spending too much time on a
minor issue.  My own sympathies being with the avant-garde (and as an
ex-"workshop" poet too), I want experimental work to be taken seriously by the
mainstream.  I also want contemporary poetry in general to be taken seriously
by the cultural studies/cultural sociology folks.  My view is that while
Beach's book has a lot going for it, this chapter is problematic in both those
efforts.

The "real issue of audience" is dealt with MUCH better by Beach in his
chapters on the Moyers special, the Nuyorican/slam poets, and Bob Holman's USA
of Poetry.

A partial list of complaints regarding this chapter would include:

1. Poor choice of Dobyns's poems, not representative of his narrative work or
what even Beach acknowledges is his best work. Beach talks as though most of
Dobyns's work is first-person autobiographical, which is not true.  A large
number of his poems, while presenting a recognizable Dobyns "voice," are
non-first person narratives.

2. No mention of Dobyns's experiences in Chile, which inform quite a few of
his poems and give some of them a possible political valence.

3. Ludicrous paragraph-length biographies of both Hejinian and Dobyns which
tip the inevitable close reading in Hejinian's favor.

4. Unfair comparison between _My Life_ ("the language poem EVERYONE loves")
and a Dobyns selected, as others have pointed out.  A better comparison might
be between a lesser-read though still important poet's Selected (Watten's FS,
perhaps) and Dobyns, or between _My Life_ and an "instant classic" of
mainstream poetry, such as _Praise_ by Robert Hass or _The Wild Iris_ by
Louise Gluck.

5. Chapter's implicit promise to deal with audience not met.

That told, I have to keep rearticulating my position: I am neither a friend
nor fan of Dobyns's poetry or the workshop mode.  I love Hejinian's work.
Yadda yadda.  I don't think the chapter is in bad faith, exactly.  But I do
think it short-circuits the real work of comparison.

There are other issues, but I'm going to review the book for The Chicago
Review so I think I'll shut up now.

Well, in fact, John Lowther's original inquiry (which literally no one, i
think, replied to, seriously, tho a number used it as a pretext for lame
witticisms)  .. was made in a certain spirit, which i think few listees
understood:  Here in @lanta we have an extremely exciting poetry scene
growing,  but of course the South is not considered a hotbed of poetry.
(i mean the real stuff, not the workshop academic stuff....)  So we are
always looking to make connections and smoke out our hidden kindred...

Folks should consult the new New Orleans Review, for a sense of some of
the possibilities lurking here in the xconfederate states.... But there is
still a long way to go, to really set off the kind of bonfire we'd like...
And as has been shrewdly analyzed by Hank Lazar (a naturalized Alabaman)
in several essays, there are still many peculiarities to our situation
here in the south:  the rather debilitating legacy of a certain vitiated
and self-conscious regionalism, for instance, which reinforces the most
trivial and establishmentarian ideas about poetic and narrative form...

Anyway, this interest in how things are shaping up down in dixie, was much
of the reason for John's original post, i believe.... To judge from many
of the responses, which trivialized it, i thought it might help point this
out...

southerly,

i think that Dan R. has handled this controversy very well.  i did not
post in favor of his original post, because it feels peculiar and awkward
to single out one poet for criticism, in this quasi-personal context....

but i and a bunch of other poets here in Atlanta felt at least very
sympathetic:  AS's work is often weak, diffuse, silly, and its extreme
frequency on the list has led at least a half-dozen people i know to find
new meaning in the phrase, "delete, don't read."  Now, i think AS's work
is sometimes energetic, interesting, provocative, and complex, also.  Not
as much as i'd like..and he sure does (as DR suggests) publish (including
this list as a form of publication) far more than maybe he should.  But,
yeah, it is helpful to be acquainted with his work... i'm afraid Kent
Johnson's extreme enthusiasm is a bit over the top; in my scheme of poetic
things AS isn't huge or important or terribly exciting...

But Dan was indeed (as he suggests) expressing the feelings of *quite a
few* people on the list.  And i feel he is right to point out that the
responses to him were a little too quick and too thoughtless:  he was not
calling for censorship.

So, as he says below:  let 80 flowers bloom......

hours away from where i am

I have a regular assignment in classes for students to read and record 20
minute selections from Moby Dick, Huckelberry Finn, Leaves of Grass, poems
of John Donne, Howl, (depending on what the class focuses on), and they
are to write short descriptions of how they made their selections, how
their understanding of the text guides them in their performance, how they
do the voices, intonation, sound effects or music (sometimes these
readings turn into productions), etc.  This is invariably an exciting,
illuminating experience.  Reading out loud allows you to experience the
oral quality of literature (particularly of something like Huckelberry
Finn) or the hidden poetic qualities of prose (the iambic pentameter of
Moby Dick), the breath rythmns of poetry (Howl), or quality or tone (the
standup comedian characteristic of AG's "America").  Reading out loud
creates connectivity and music that otherwise the text-scanning eyeball
often misses.  Taking turns I had a class read excerpts from a Dorothy
Parker story alongside excerpts from Gertrude Stein out loud -- and
suddenly the works opened up and students "got" Stein and even felt a
strange parallel between two seemingly incompatable writers.  Open mouth;
open brain.

David Kellogg will be more articulate than I can be on this issue, but
that's not going to stop me from writing.
        Audience studies for poetry would be interesting and are
necessary, especially given that there seem to be dozens of laments
published annually about poetry and the loss of audience (the Death of
Poetry genre). By audience studies, I mean  actual, empirical
studies of the sort, for instance, that Bourdieu undertakes in
Distinction. Closer to (my own anglo-american) home, in the late 80s,
cultural studies scholars focusing on mass communication shifted attention
from the texts to audience.  The purpose seemed to be to empower the
audience, to see, as I seem to remember David Kellogg mentioning at least
once when explicating Bourdieu, what uses the audience made of the
programs.
        There would be several differences between a cultstud TV audience
study and any future poetry audience study. One that immediately pops to
mind is that TV critics, from the Frankfurt School on, assumed passivity
on behalf of tv audiences, whereas poetry readers (readers in general)
where considered to be somewhat more active (then again, a common
criticisim of "workshop poetry" is that it assumes greater passivity than
does more formally investigative poetry).
        (I.A. Richards' _Practical Criticism_ as primitive audience
study?)
        In any case, while I think that Audience study is necessary at
some point, a MAJOR problem with all the cultstud works I can think of
(Ien Ang's Watching Dallas, even Bourdieu's Distinction, to name just two)
is that, ultimately, all that changes is that the TEXT shifts, from being
one produced by an author-figure (writer, director, production company) to
being one produced by the critic-commentator. That is, the AUDIENCE
becomes the text, shaped by the commentator and subsequently commented
upon by the commentator. This would strike me as a major limitation of
audience studies.
        Of course, it's not like a study of the "primary" "text" is
problem free.
        Enough from me for now.

Actually, let's *not*, on this list, directly. There are scads of free web
page services out there who'll give you several Mb of disk space on a web
server to put up poems. I humbly suggest that authors seeking feedback from
poetics list members get themselves some web page space from one of these
services (Yahoo, Tripod, etc.) and place their poems there, and simply post
the URL to the poetics list.

Those interested can visit the site with a click, or at most a quick cut
and paste of the web URL. Those not interested will only have to scan past
a few lines. (This is the solution that some other mailing lists I am on
use to handle material marginal to the express putpose of the list, and it
seems to work all right.)

Many word processors allow basic web page formatting, and AOL has a free
HTML layout program called AOLPress, which is no more difficult to use than
the average word processor.

Could someone on the list help me with this? I have a new novel out, A Boy
in Winter, and several people have now asked me if its title relates to a
Philip Larkin poem, "A Girl in Winter."  Looked in a Larkin collected and
couldn't find such poem.  Does anyone have a clue?  (PS-- I know Larkin
wasn't a good man-- I'd just like info on that line).  Backchannel if
you'd like.

in all fairness, it seems like I hear again and again how poetry has a
larger audience than ever. Is this larger than ever audience reading
what I read? Doubt it.

The other night on local news here in DC I saw a story about what I
think was a Chicago Police Precinct that got together once a week to
read their own poetry and listen to each other. Community members came
and participated, etc. No they didn't seem to be addressing the issues
I'm dealing with, but still, people are reading/listening/writing words
in some way that keeps the whole big thing moving.

Please also see the popularity/mutability of hip hop.

Can you send me that scheme?  The poetics of schemata, the schematics of
poetry.  How poetic.  Kinda like instructions on building a television.  I
was just building a poem from scratch yesterday, some wires, some wood, some
capacitors, resistors, and was looking for a good schematic.  Maybe i need
to head to Hotlanta to find them?  Joe's Poetry Schematics Shop down there
by Five Points? : )

actually, he he seemed to be advocating a particular form of censorship -
self-censorship.  self-censorship from threats.  like of being labelled a
crap artist.  this type of censorship is what keeps newspapers and
televisions full of doodoo, full of propaganda.  I think the NYT might have

I hope this was too quick and too thoughtless.  Let's have my lawyer and

it.

Hoyem had a very decent book of his own poems in the 1960s and this
press and its cousins/ancestors have been responsible for a large
portion of the small press universe for a long time. At the very
least one would hope that a university (e.g. Berkeley, which published
Hoyem's edition of Moby Dick) would invite the press as an ongoing archive
(rather the way Hatch Show Prints, the press did most of the 19th C.
minstrel show and later Grand Ole Opry flyers is now a "project" of the
Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, just round the corner from Ryman
Auditorium). It would be a tragedy to lose this resource.

Eviction stalks letterpress printers creating new Bible

KEN GARCIA

Thursday, October 21, 1999

©1999 San Francisco Chronicle

URL:
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/10/21/MN17742.DTL


In the beginning was the Word. In the end was the lease termination notice.

And while the end is not quite yet, the folks at Arion Press, one of the
finest printing houses in the nation, know well that their days upon Earth
may be a shadow.

Such biblical quotations are fitting in this case because Andrew Hoyem, the
publisher of Arion books, is in the process of creating one of the world's
greatest Bibles.

But just as the book is taking shape, so is a familiar San Francisco
controversy: Hoyem and his specialized team of letterpress printers are
being evicted from their longtime home on Bryant Street in the South of
Market area, a place where meticulous book designers have been painting
words for nearly a century.

Long before rising land prices, astronomical rents and multimedia, there was
an art form called fine printing that found a home in San Francisco. The
city became a showplace for some of the great American bookmakers of the
modern age. People like John Henry Nash, Lawton Kennedy, and Edward and
Robert Grabhorn all gravitated to the cultured city by the bay. Hoyem, who
was Robert Grabhorn's last partner before his death, is their direct
descendant.

The pages of the city's past are zipping by with such speed these days that
it is hard to remember that beautiful books are still in demand, even if
they are not available at a click from a discount merchant somewhere in the
ether of the Internet. And only in development- crazed San Francisco, it
seems, could the future of the Good Book end up being in such a bad place.

``It's a terrible situation for us,'' Hoyem told me the other day. ``There
is a serious question about whether we can continue to function at all. And
here we are in the midst of printing our biggest project ever.''

That would be the new Bible, the greatest single challenge in bookmaking.
Hoyem, whose publishing house is renowned as a spawning ground for
beautiful, handcrafted books, started the project more than a year ago. The
Bible, all 400 copies, is being printed and bound mostly by hand. A work of
printing art, and carrying a art-heavy price tag: $7,250 for an unbound
edition, $8,500 for a leather-bound edition. That's without the
hand-illuminated letters, which would raise the price another $2,500.

But that printing run has been disrupted by news of ``progress.'' The owners
of the brick building at 460 Bryant St., the real estate arm of Fisher
Friedman Associates, an architectural firm, are evicting all the tenants,
ostensibly to do seismic upgrades.

Hoyem believes that the engineering work could take place with his printing
presses in place, but the landlord has so far refused to extend the lease.
And Hoyem says he has been told that the architects want to develop the
building to its ``full economic capacity.''

All the tenants, including some sewing firms and a few other small
businesses, have been told to be out by June 30, 2000. Nothing in the Bible
about that, although you might find it on a fiscal year calendar.

In Arion's case, however, moving is about as easy as printing ``War and
Peace'' one letter at a time. Within his shop sit priceless presses, rare
casting machines, keyboards and other equipment. His firm now owns the famed
type foundry of Mackenzie & Harris, which began using its hot metal magic on
equipment purchased for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition. In
1925, Mackenzie & Harris moved to a new building on Folsom Street and
Hawthorne Lane, where their typography machines churned until they were
relocated to the Bryant Street building in 1974.

So finding a new home for Arion involves moving more than 30 tons of
cast-iron inventory and carefully reinstalling a complex configuration of
gas lines, electrical lines and compressed air machines. Hoyem said the
minimum estimate of any move so far has been $400,000 -- money, he says,
that he does not have. At the very least, he believes, he would have to
close the type foundry if he's forced to move. And the result of that would
be even more costly.

``We simply could not make the kinds of books we make today,'' he says.
``It's very painful to contemplate.''

And even more so, if, like Hoyem, one bleeds ink.

Hoyem, by way of the Midwest and the Navy, started out at a small press shop
in San Francisco in 1961, printing books no one else would publish,
including some of the ``Beats,'' Philip Whalen and William Burroughs. Money
was harder to come by than market share. He printed everything -- birth
announcements, wedding announcements, even, desperate thing, office
stationery.

He ended up meeting the brothers Grabhorn, legends in their field, who
responded to his request for printing assistance as if he were being
shepherded into a secret society. By 1966, Hoyem and Robert Grabhorn formed
a partnership, which lasted until 1973 when Hoyem went on his own.

He formed Arion Press, after the Greek poet who was saved from drowning by a
dolphin. And then Arion built its own mythical status in the fine art book
field, starting with an edition of ``Moby Dick'' that included wood
engravings of Herman Melville, whaling tools and even sea creatures. It was
a tome that collectors ranked as one of the two or three greatest American
fine press books. Ever.

That was many years and printings ago. Hoyem decided that his great project
would be a classic rendition of the Bible, an undertaking that he said would
probably be the last folio Bible printed from hot metal type, a book to rank
up there with Johannes Gutenberg's 1455 landmark version.

A timeless treasure, now running short on time.

Hoyem says Arion has just completed printing the book of Isaiah, almost
exactly halfway through the 1,350-page Bible. Since the landlord so far has
declined to grant a lease extension, Hoyem says he'll be lucky to finish the
printing by June, and almost certainly will not be able to complete the
binding.

Profit driven by development was not a key topic for the prophets, either in
the end or the beginning. Hoyem is just trying to find a way to survive.
That's not an easy thing for a practitioner of a lost art in a rapidly
changing city.

``That which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten,'' the Bible
says. Words to live by, which is probably why they wrote them down.

It's not that I have a "very clear" idea of what's within or without - in
fact, just the opposite. What seems to be the case (with numerous excep-
tions including the post I'm replying to) is that a kind of rational dis-
course is taken as normative here; then there are the poems, the experi-
ments, and poeticized replies to the discourse. And I think there might be
other ways to discuss poetics, which at least for me goes beyond poetry to
the flesh and bones of language and the symbolic, in a way that normative
prose doesn't.

I'm not very clear here, for which apologies - Alan

Not to make a silly comment, but I was startled at the idea of a $195 fee
for being assigned an ISBN number--I thought this was a free service!!!  In
Canada here, I've received an ISBN number and an ISSN number through the
National Library, free of charge.

the book expressly happened. it happened without a lot of disinterest
lacking, and that's fine. the public had to have something, for a while, and
this was it. the book that could be spoken of, within a forum of people who
know they are peers, ready with a whiff of exactly how people react to the
thing they say they think they say they are thinking about, everyday, as
much as possible. exhausting as this sounds, it is purposeful, such a
freshness. there will be quiet times, and the poets - oh yes, the subject of
all this is poetry - will render that somehow, in a perfection of what they
do in doing what they do. hours between this time and that time are empty,
bereft, of the thing that leads to the poetry. in a specific way, too, in
the sense that writing takes just a little time, and maybe gives it back
somehow. not to be disputatious, just stuck in the fine fancy of the poetry
thing made and built and sent into a world where poetry needs to go. it
seems like process has got a good thing going. daily weekly yearly arrives
the poems, or something comes. again to clarify (which poetry never has to
do): evidence exists, not to say DNA, but that there are ways to understand
that something happens, even with an ignorant turn of mind, or a closing
emotional door or what you will. just consider the mutability. it seems so
dormant at times but can it attend to everything and all the time? a book
wanders around, awaiting its share. or the book can't happen because the
closed sign makes the market unsafe. does any of this make sense? think
about it: a process of words, or word-like things, collecting in some way,
with a severe lack of descriptive capability by any of us to witness the
event, tho we try. and we want to get excited, and we deem an audience
becomes the creation, or what the hell happens. such a frank muddle. why
care that the book happened? dire lives living inside definitions that will
complete the affirmations with denials: just so human, aggravated and
tending toward confusion. nevertheless, a moral question lurks within the
book. a strange necessity, given that the book and the writer do nothing,
and both probably feel sad about that. one would expect a greater
registration of the entire pathos and scheme and critical mass that causes
the bloody machine to grind its gears. for this fear called poetry faces a
tough battle, always.

NB: this piece either is or isn't theoretical and likewise may or may not be
a poem. whatever fits the expressed purpose of this list, that's what I'm
down with. AHB

John,
re: your mention of my mention of the term "seriousness" with respect to
what's posted on the list, let me say that I, too, am serious about
seriousness in ways that are, for me, energizing and, recognizing the
energy, completely hilarious for about ten seconds of pure joy, being
slapped up side the head, stupid!  Yes!  More!  (of anything!)  The list, of
course,

is a sort of microcosm of the "world of poetry" out there in the big bad
world, full of possibilities for publication and position and power and all
the good things one would then feel free to buy into in order to have the
advantage of being in on whatever was (is) at hand.  Right.  All the great
readings ARE nine hours away.  But what I want to get at, and to, in
addition AND instead of all the great readings,

is some sense that the "world" (of poetry) seems very much caught up in the
sense of itself as a business.  Sure, it's an exchange, but given the
hierarchical nature of who's who, how "free" can the exzchange ever get to
be?  I mean, to say your piece and be at peace and all that is for certain
satisfying in some personal way, but the public momentum of any group effort
always seems (to me) to get nipped in the bud before gaining the authority
of full flower in many ways BECAUSE of its treatment as "a serious issue"
which then opens up that can of wormy roses that shows forth all of the
presumptions that prevent some more full consideration of "the issues at
hand" from really going anywhere, because they become subject to the
authority of a proof, as if there were a truth at bottom that needs rooting
up and out, that "truth" being nothing but the presumption of an authority
wch then contends for something other than the issues at hand (what ARE
they, anyway?) in a sort of chummy exchange of critical remarks that passes
for seriousness.  My sense is, at base,

it's this "seriousness" that is not supposed to be breached, and when it is,
it's to be filled quickly with something like cement, when, in fact, a
hollow laugh might just as well suffice.  It's true,

we won't get more from the list than what's already on it - you only get the
things that are - yet what's on it is often disconcertingly empty because it
seems to fall so short of what otherwise is sufficient to life, making chaos
(total), maybe, instead of merely making sense.  As a footnote,

Douglas Rothschild's "questionable" post that I mentioned last time around,
I hear, isn't even in the list archive.  Perhaps the question "what does
anyone hope to gain through editing (elimination)" will become increasingly
pertinent - is it to the end of clarity?  & if so, what is the figure &/or
ground we are supposed to clearly see?  While I can't at the moment see
ANYthing clearly, I think I smell something up ahead that curiously
resembles absence.

Maxine,

It's a Larkin novel, one of two.  (The other is _Jill_.)

Best,

Jo=E3o Cabral de Melo Neto died last week. He was 79 years old. One of the=
 most
important Brazilian poets of the postwar generations, Cabral continues to
exert
a strong influence on many younger Brazilian poets. He was remembered at a
celebration for Haroldo de Campos=92s seventieth birthday at Yale this past
weekend and certainly the two poets suggests the enormous range of Brazilian
poetry in the past fifty years. As R=E9gis Bonvincino writes to me about=
 Cabral:
=93Along with Carlos Drummond de Andrade and Murilo Mendes, Cabral is=
 considered
the best poet of Brazilian Poetry born in the 20's.=94

Cabral=92s Selected Poetry: 1937-1990 is published by Wesleyan, and includes=
 the
well-known translation of his work by Elizabeth Bishop. This afternoon=
 Horacio
Costa and I translated two poems of Cabral that I wanted to post to the=
 list,
with R=E9gis adding some changes by email to the first. =20

The Last Poem

I don=92t know who sends me poetry
nor whether Who would call it that.

But who who may be, who
that Who (myself, my sweat?),

be it woman, landscape, or the no
that needs fill the void,

to make, for example, the crutch
that I made walk the left soul,

to Whom should be given the inglorious burden
I ask: my last poem

antilyric, made into antiverse.

ARTIFICIAL CINNAMON NATION, a primer, by Bill Marsh

A gift to the muses by one of the worker-bee brethren, parts of
Artificial Cinnamon Nation was "constructed from a limited
vocabulary comprised of mostly 4letter+ anagrams":

mortal narcotic oat
rictal tonic
anionic cocoa float

while other parts arc from the luminescence of the aleatoric to the
applied science of meaning-making:

teaching creativity
children do not engage;
offering rewards the corporate

       #####################related it to the hymen, which Jennifer
       #####################didn't understand. Follow me, Julu
       #           #       #said; jump, and we'll make it ok
                   #somewhere down here where for a moment they
                   #rested, as if their skins were torn and open
                   #from the struggle. They jumped up quickly

       ####             ####the only landscape at all. That's it!
       #                   #shouted THE PRESIDENT, be careful now,

I largely agree with the (implicit) assertion here that Mark's dismissal of
Alan Sondheim's work without benefit of anything close to a reading
constitutes a problem for the kind of reasoned "restraint" or "self-control"
he advocates re: Alan's postings. At the same time, however, the urge to up
the ante with this:

this type of censorship is what keeps newspapers and televisions full of
doodoo, full of propaganda.  I think the NYT might have a job for you!

..ends up moving in much the same direction - i.e., a collapsing of
meaningful distinctions in favor of a rhetoric of dismissive outrage,
bemusement, etc. Calls for "discursive protocol" articulated by individuals
without access to the immense, consolidated social surplus of, say, the
Times simply are not the same thing as the systemic and systematic
distortion of knowledge by capital.

Now if you were to say that at times that very individual rush to dismiss
has been one of the many vectors along which Times-style distortion has
operated, I'd certainly be with you. But media monopolies have ways of
enforcing, cajoling, etc., such behaviors from their writers and readers
that go far beyond the very general "making folks feel bad," which seems to
be about the greatest level of social violence listees can muster in their
conflicts. Again, not to say that isn't a problem - at the risk of adding my
voice to the calls for restraint, could we perhaps make sure to read each
other, and be willing to articulate that reading out in the open, before
resorting to dismissal out-of-hand? Obviously, there are cases of personal
attack, "flaming," etc., in which the dismissive virtual sneer, rather than
the time-consuming response to an interlocutor who isn't going to bother
with a response anyhow, might be a useful option. But it seems to me we're a
long way off from that in Alan's writings, which interrogate the language(s)
of this list (well or badly [usefully or not?] is for a closer reading to
decide - though as a minor publisher of his work, I obviously have my
intellectual investments here), rather than simply attack them in the
"I-can-shout-over-a-DSL-line-louder-than-you" mode. We've seen the latter
here before, so I'm guessing we know what it looks like.

That said, however, and without knowing Mark P., I'd give 10 to 1 odds to
anyone here that he doesn't have the weight of capital accumulation behind
him to come up to the level of the Times as an ideological "power." (And in
almost every instance, his ideological work on the list, when based on a
careful engagement, has been pretty well opposed to the practices of that
gray bastion of yellow journalism - my thanks, in general, for his presence
in this space). Hell, I doubt any of us here even rate a defunct Hearst rag
limping toward the inglorious end of a short-con joint operating agreement.
It might benefit us, though, to make a principled distinction between our
practices and theirs - a little more care and attention on both sides of
this argument, perhaps?

Subject:      On Number-Systems
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

(This illustrates what I mean by a poetics of the world.)


On Number-Systems


"And reading Knuth on number-base systems which include, for example a
ternary system with +1, -1, and 0 as the symbols. Such systems can absorb
the positive and negative numbers; there are others, such as ones based on
2i, that can absorb the complex number system as well (i.e. a single num-
ber of the form ax^n + bx^(n-1) ... +dx^1 +e). This is an amazing economy
of means. The book is my favorite in the Knuth programming series - the
volume on Seminumerical Algorithms - since it goes into the construct of
arithmetic processes and algorithms we all take for granted. In my own
work, I've always been fascinated by the possibility of base-1 and base-
infinity systems; in the former, of course, addition becomes concatena-
tion, and in the latter, the addition of any two unique symbols results in
a third, i.e. J + K = L. There's an easy translation from the decimal sys-
tem; say 25 * 26 = 650 - one would just look up within the infinite multi-
plication table, [25] and [26] and see [650] where the [x] represents the
unique symbol. One goes from algorithms to infinite memorization or look-
up. The phenomenology of this is really interesting, I think. For multip-
lication with base-1, one returns again to concatenation, for example 1111
* 111 = 111 111 111 111 which is the same as 4 * 3 = 12. There's nothing
to learn in terms of memorization or lookup tables here; there's nothing
to look up or memorize. Think of this as an infinite abacus of sticks
placed in a single row; one moves from base-infinity with its pure economy
of place and infinite symbols, to base-one with its pure economy of symbol
and infinite place. This material is fascinating; it says something about
the stability of the world itself, the Aristotelian logic at the heart of
the almost-disconnected plateau of the life-world. I wrote years ago ex-
tensively on such phenomenologies; it's great to see the structures them-
selves in Knuth."* To place sticks in the row, letters in a row, one
counts (literally) on the stability of place and demarcation - _these_
sticks are counted - _those_ remain unaccounted-for and uncounted. The
sticks need not be in a row; there's no need for geometry, positioning,
since what one is concerned with is the pure quantity of sticks, not a
positional relationship. Interestingly, positionality also disappears with
base-infinity, since every operation and quantity involves only _one_ pos-
ition. In The Matrix, there is considerable discussion about "who is the
One" - in base-one, everyone is, and in base-infinity, whatever is _there_
is the one.

What is going on here? On one hand, with base-one, there is the fact and
phenomenology of _substance_ and the quantifiability and stability of the
world; on the other, with base-infinity, there is the problematic of the
proper name in the Kripkean sense of rigid designator. In the former,
names shift towards processes; in the latter, processes harden as names.

One might also consider issues of perception: exactly what constitutes a
stick or a symbol? Could, for example, two trees represent 2541 and 1734,
a third representing 2541^1734 base-infinity? Is all of nature, in fact,
the mathematics of base-infinity write large? At the other end, what might
one say about typification, standardization: What constitutes a stick and
what doesn't? Sticks are related to tallying, of course; they are indexi-
cal in relation to the quantification of the real, a one-to-one relation-
ship with other physical objects. On the other hand one might consider the
base-infinity symbols both symbolic (standing-for quantity as proper names
or summarizations) and "quasi-ikonic," the coagulation of quantity itself
as unary.

And there are issues of memory: _Where_ is the place of counting - which
sticks have already been marked, which remain unmarked? This depends not
only on the stability of place, but our knowledge of place as well. Since
base-infinity relies on individuated symbols, place, even the place of
_announcement,_ becomes less relevant; memory of place is replaced by
symbol memory: 2541^1734 = [2541^1734]

Between base-one and base-infinity, the structure and variety of the world
appear - not the infinite and obdurate variety of base-infinity, nor the
pure quantifications of base-one, but gatherings, foreclosings, metaphors
and metonymies. It's at the limits that nature becomes simultaneously mute
and revelatory; in-between it's all culture and our image writ large,
rubbed against the structure of the world.

Word:  re-ers
Guess:
Sorry, the word was "refers"
Another word?

in the earlier "up with down" post, i pulled out the ~seriousness~ and wove
it in with what i was doing but had some misgiving in that many of the other
questions brought up there seemed much better, more pertinent etc, but i
simply had no answers to them, nor any clues really

but of what you've said most recently "Yes!  More!  (of anything!)" i wd
gladly second ---- serious about play ---- playfully serious ---- but i'm
drifting a bit

you wrote;
        "But what I want to get at (...) is some sense that the "world" (of
poetry) seems very much caught up in the sense of itself as a business.
Sure, it's an exchange, but given the hierarchical nature of who's who, how
"free" can the exzchange ever get to be?"

how free do we want it ?

i remember waxing on to kent johnson a year or more ago in a post-yasusada
dream wherein i was envisioning a poetry world where no one knew who anyone
was and everything was submitted and published anonymously --- i'd said that
the yasusada business was a start but that it really only displaced the
author-function and that as long as kent was identified with the book he wd
get stuck with the bag (A-funct.) and that perhaps something more radical,
more ultimately leveling was needed

but yr point is in our world

and i've heard a lot of griping from poets of all stripes about in-groups
and favors and this and that and it bothers me --- it bothers me such that i
am in point of fact planning to take an extended break from poetry writing
and this list probably as soon as i get the two manuscripts i'm working on
and the few other obligations out of the way ---- i'm overstating that
somewhat, making it more dramatic than it is, and there are other reasons
why i'm going on something of a sabatical from this "biz" in 2000 (back to
music and into visual art)

so what do we do ? yr asking great questions --- and, by the header of yr
post, asking me, but i truly don't know

one thought tho : is the poetry world any more or less questionable than the
non-poetry world ?



                i'm trying

        to be playful here

                but
                        i doubt

        it's
 coming across,

        that it's there
                                ultimately

(cue the "hollow laugh")

you wrote;

"It's not that I have a "very clear" idea of what's within or without - in
fact, just the opposite. What seems to be the case (with numerous exceptions
including the post I'm replying to) is that a kind of rational discourse is
taken as normative here; then there are the poems, the experiments, and
poeticized replies to the discourse. And I think there might be other ways
to discuss poetics, which at least for me goes beyond poetry to the flesh
and bones of language and the symbolic, in a way that normative prose
doesn't."

and i don't mean to be too argumentative on this score but i would like to
say that i think that i am at least am generally rational and, with certain
qualifications, in *favor* of reason --- that is i just don't buy the
division of us up into rational/irrational ---- with anything called
rational meant to be about as immediate as a tax return and as evocative as
an hour long lecture on deduction begining and ending with socrates as a
mortal --- but even logic is a lot more interesting and loose (yes, i said
loose) if one spends a bit of time with it --- peirce's third type of
inference "abduction" (also called "retroduction") which encompasses hunches
and guesses and intuitions in a framework where one can actually talk about
them rather than ushering them behind the curtain, dimming the lights and
playing unconscious theme music    one    more    time

i'd rather see poetry as "the language art" (antin's phrase) and thus
potentially encompassing all the things you mention above including that
which it does seem that you still wish, if not to exclude, to deal with
less;  "rational ________" (pick yr designation)

and here is a sonnet that i've composed as a coda to this whole business ---
may it sooth the hearts of many

I may be wrong, but I think it was Eugen Gomringer probably in "Die
Konstellationen - las constelaciones - les constellations - the
constellations", Gomringer Press Frauenfeld 1965. I´m pretty sure it was
Gomringer, actually. It couldn´t have been anyone else, really. It could
have been Jandl in "Serienfuss", but it isn´t. It was Gomringer. And if it
wasn´t him, it was someone else, but Gomringer led the way. There is some of
his work online on ubuweb. If it wasn´t Gomringer, there is a minor chance
of it being Franz Mon. It couldn´t have been Heissenbüttel, no way. Mon or
Gomringer, not Jandl or Heissenbüttel. Actually, it was Gomringer. Ping.

I'm tempted to write, did He who made the iamb make thee? But I'm not sure
where that goes.

On a more serious note, if you noticed, I never used the word "irrational"
or create a binary opposition as such; I was referring to nothing more
than the use of prose or prosaic or ordinary language such as this, in
relation to other forms which might also problematize such language, your
sonnet being an example.

These threads, one of them threatening Alan with censorship or begging for
support of censorship or whatever, the other about a kind of "the boys in
the band"-style regionalism and demographic query totally ignoring that this
list is not only read or used by Americans, border upon the same issue for
me.
I love Alan´s posts. I came to the list to find out more about a poetic
tradition and a tradition of discussing poetics, that appeared to be very
much alive, quite contrary to what I experience on the german academic and
avantgarde scene, where there is basically one (print) magazine (Das
Schreibheft) that caters to the needs of those who believe that poetry
develops its content through form and does not make statements about
something it already knows, or uses forms that are already known and
accepted to make statements that are as well. (Most poems dealing with
travel are excellent examples for this reactionary function of a
form-content coherency that is a priori d´accord, the exotic setting
providing the "newness" necessary to sell bullshit and lies as art.)
I love Alan´s postings because they are daring, they always are, they are so
fast it can be annoying and makes my head spin how fast Alan writes,
watching his speed on "trace" speeds up the spin even more. Alan´s posts are
always in danger of falling back on themselves, always in danger of failing
of being ridiculous of breaking. They are fragile and tentative, they don´t
live in Alabama, where it is probably lovely, I don´t mind regionalism, mind
you, there are excellent works drawing on minority languages around, very
regionalist, very provoking to the mainstream use of language. Andrea
Zanzotto is one example, Ernst Jandl another, H.C. Artmann, Reinhardt
Priessnitz, Thomas Kling,  to name a few Italian, Austrian and German poets
who have worked or are working in this field.
I love Alan´s postings. They are what poetry and poetics should be. They
break my heart at times, they get me pissed at other times. I may disagree
with him on Heiner Müller and his postings on Stalinism may get on my nerves
and drive me up the wall, but poetry is not about agreement (that´s so
pretty). Poetics can (perhaps) be discussed from the "outside" of poetry,
but there is no way to a poetry that does not encorporate it´s poetic
reflections, which is always a reflection on cognition, in its form. Alan´s
postings, his writing through the avatars Jennifer, Julu, Alan and Nikuko
are highly reflected and reflexive texts on poetics, subjectivity and
writing, very passionate and dangerous, little bombs, some go off, others
don´t, not just now, not now, perhaps later.
Allright, now about regionalism. Poetry doesn´t travel well. Poetry is a
national pasttime. Poetry is american, southern, northern, bostonian,
english (and all of this is still in English). If Poetry wants to travel, it
needs translation, and translations don´t travel well, either. I walked into
one of the best Berlin bookstores yesterday and asked about Jack Spicer,
guess what the reaction was, and I wasn´t even asking for a translation. It
will take months until I can lay my hand on a book, and it took this list to
get me to know about Spicer in the first place. Try asking for Reinhard
Priessnitz in Boston. Poetry doesn´t travel well, but when it does, the
effects are often amazing, I´m thinking of Apollinaire reading Brentano, of
Pound reading the Veda, of Duschamp in New York, of Brinkmann reading O´Hara
etc.
It may be just a funny coincidence, but Alan is one of the very few
subscribers to this list, who even mentioned someone who didn´t publish in
english. It´s not a coincidence.

Love, Thomas Dorow

i'm feeling annoyed and disturbed enough over the minor 'raphael on
sondheim' strain that i have to chirp up: i work hard to appreciate others'
opinions, working especially hard to appreciate ~opioniated~ people (the
more blooming flowers the better) but that there seems to be a consistent,
underlying, shared opinion that there is such a thing as too little too
much, too little enough publishing/broadcasting/ultimately sharing of poetry
strikes me as...outrageous--after all this is poetry! the fact that this
list, although theoretically democratic in nature (being online) and
international in its concerns and subscribers, has ~only~ 500 (or so!)
subscribers--and that, for example, only a tiny fraction of whom comprise
the second majority (Canadian)--to me points precisely towards why readers
and educators and publishers so consistently shy away from contemporary
poetry.

but maybe i'm being a little too romantic here?

               ping pong


is the way it goes, I think.  You'll find it in Gomringer's "von rand nach

"Concrete Poetry: A World View."

        a business


i started thinking again about this and am perhaps getting more confused as
i go on --- i've done these magazines and lost heaps of money and have
another in the can waiting and waiting and weighing on me that i can't
afford to pub it yet --- and i make no money on these things it all goes out
really, but that doesnt discount being a business, right ?  i mean there are
plenty of things we call businesses that lose money so that can't be the
dividing line

but maybe it can still ?  that is businesses are at least concerned to make
money even if they lose it and i never expect to make any ---- or leave the
magazine publishing thing behind ---- i don't expect to make any money of
being a poet, i suppose i cd, i cd win a contest and get a book published
and win some $ but enough to think of my writing as a business ?

so skip money, maybe what yr saying isnt about cash but clout ? capital in
that sense ? where we hope to get pubbed in the chicago review or the
gertrude stein awards or win the national poetries series competition b/c
"it'll open doors" us ?  is that the "business" which you mean ?  ---- i'm
reminded of something someone told me about going to a reading and the young
poet who was reading that night marched up introduced themself to everyone
and was later heard to say "I LOVE NETWORKING!" ---- is that the same sort
of "business" ?

admittedly, i like meeting poets ---- my trip to LA last year was a blast
and i look forward to new orleans next month ---- and i wd be mightily
pleased to win the national poetry series and have a bit of hope that my
work might get read or find it's way into places it won't if i end up
publishing it myself

where does it start being the "business" ?   when i start hoping that other
contest winners DONT win as it wd affect me negatively ?   when i start
schmoozing and playing for favor with editors i don't like b/c it wd "do me
good" ?  i think those things should qualify for the "biz" which i wd wish
to combat which it wd suck to step into

but i'm left feeling that while i understand, i think, the thrust of yr
statement stephen, and too, see myself the businessy behavior now and again,
that i DONT think of poetry as a business or the poetry world as business
community ---- that doing so seems somehow a self-blinding

conflictedly

Greetings,

I am in search of material on and by Jackson Mac Low.  There is material
here at Stanford but I'm sure that there is work that I can't find.
Perhaps this could lead to an annotated bibliography of some sort.  My
project of the moment is a seminar paper on his Light poems.

How do I make a post?

Azure's Love of Jennifer


"If the 19th century was, and I for one am thoroughly convinced that it
was, concerned with origins, then the present century is an era that has
increasingly looked for roots. A quest for origins and a search for roots
are not the same and not to be confused. The quest for origins focuses on
'whatness,' while the search for roots focuses on 'whoness.' The issue of
origins is typically centered around natural ancestry, and Darwin provided
the brand name for his age. In contrast, the quest for roots is essential-
ly concerned with probing a cultural heritage, defining the fibres of an
ethnicity, mapping ideational stratigraphies. The origins issue is charac-
teristically a biological matter, while that of roots is generally intel-
lectual in scope." (from Thomas Markey, welcome remarks to the Bellagio
conference, 1988, When Cultures Collide: The Indo-Europeans and Pre-Indo-
Europeans.) Thus said, when I seek for the origin of Jennifer, and I do, I
may look no farther than "Jennifer, Where are you?," a resonant film by
Leslie Thornton produced in 1981. But I may look likewise to my mother
Jennifer Sondheim, my daughter Jennifer Sondheim, my sister Jennifer Sond-
heim. I may look to my roots, my cultural heritage among the tribe of
Jennifers, who, like the tribe of Alans, wreaked havoc in Europe and the
British Isles. For Jennifer is neither root nor rhizome, but bundles and
sheaves of tendrils, glistening with moisture, sliding across lovers and
bodies, dreams and texts, words pouring out of mouths, tongues sliding in.
Think of the beautiful skein of the world in the form of tendril interlac-
ings; if the 1970s and 1980s were concerned with grids, the 1990s and
2000s are concerned with tendrils lazily pooling among wetware components,
as if there were shudderings across the webs and nets of meristemating
roots. Jennifer moves blindly among open cracks, holes, leaks, seepages in
the real and the programming of the real; the real moves blindly among her
openings as well. When my eyes are closed, when Azure is above me, when my
tongue devours her fluids, her skin, the delicacy of her eyes, when her
tongue devours my fluids, my skin, the delicacy of my eyes, it is the uni-
cellular layer of Jennifer that coheres the real between us, ensures our
return to language. Jennifer is the bruising of the world, its contusions,
as one moves clumsily among the things and thoughts of the world.

So how could she be the unicellular layer, tendrils, and bruisings, all at
once? Because it is the surface and the inscribing of the surface that
ruins the most; and it's the unicellular layer of Jennifer that defines
the space between us; and it's the tendrils of Jennifer which unicellular-
ly search out the crevices between my lover and myself; and it's the
bruising of my skin and breasts and necks that murmurs Jennifer! Jennifer;
and it's the unicellular layer of tendrils of Jennifer that mark our his-
tory on mattress, sheets, rooms, provinces, and worlds of my love and me;
and it's "JENNIFER!" Azure cries in her sleep, her naked body reaching out
everywhere in the room, looking for imaginary origins, shattering imagin-
ary roots.

Tenney and all,

BOO 7 includes the discussion I organized and transcript I edited
with Harryette Mullen, Steve McCaffery, and others. I had invited
Harryette up to Calgary to give a talk, a reading, and to participate
on a panel in 1996, for which Jeff Derksen and I gave Harryette and
Steve ten questions. They did not have time to answer the questions,
but they asked their own and the discussion is good.

In any case, Deanna Ferguson, one of the eds of BOO (a mag now
defunct), still has plenty copies of #7. She can be reached at
lounge@netsign.com

If someone wants to put this interview/discussion up on the web,
please let me know! I think it's worth doing.

On Mullen (but this info is ca. '97 and I don't have recent),
there's also an interview Magee & co. did in Combo 1. Also a Callaloo
is devoted to her work. Elizabeth Frost wrote on Mulllen and Stein.
I'm sure there's plenty out there by now.

Subject: Re: generation returns again & again


        Yes, I have to say that I wish I could be pleased to be quoted by
Christopher Beach, but I'm really sorry to be so painfully misunderstood.
I'm going to post this note to the UBPoetics List also, just so lots of
other people know that I find his generational comments foolish; I hope
those of you who already wrote about this issue will do the same, since
the UB Poetics List for the most part has been filled with kind words for
a book that is so dominated by the rigid hierarchies of the worst kind of
academic thinking that it's practically unreadable.

        Notice that the first function of Beach's quote is to DICTATE to
poets what their critical frame of reference should be, and secondly to
take it as a hierarchical given that poetics, in order to be serious,
MUST somehow deal directly with hierarchies Beach himself is creating.
Never mind, of course, that the introduction to A POETICS OF
CRITICISM more directly addresses itself to the problems of cultural
studies and thus does not define itself as limited to some "history of
poetry," and never mind the fact that the people in it are NOT defined
generationally, unless one assumes that Jerome McGann, Bernadette Mayer
and some others are "second generation language poets." Clearly,
according to Beach we can't be serious UNLESS we write about Hejinian,
Silliman, Perelman, etc--for Beach, there simply can be no other
poetic issue than language poetry.

        His book seems a case in point of the worst kind of politically
and literally CONSERVATIVE attempt at canonization, an academic process
which Beach wholly and uncritically accepts precisely, one imagines,
because that's how he manages to maintain his position in the academic
hierarcy which he mistakes for a POETIC hierarchy. Thus the real subtext
of the book is how the academic marketplace DEFORMS poetic thinking to
meet academic marketplace demands--"here is the field of acceptable poetry
to the academy; language poetry can now be defined as academically
acceptable; therefore all poetics must speak to it." As usual, of course,
this sort of process can only be accomplished by ERASING specific
poetries--notice his
complete LACK of reference to any specific poetry relative to the
"generation" that he himself creates to serve the fictions of his
marketplace. He takes several small critical comments by myself and Steve
Evans, purposefully misunderstands their context, and creates a whole
generation of poets that he then refuses to mention. That
he does this in the name of supposedly promoting the value of avant garde
poetry is astonishing--in fact the form of his argument, and the fictional
historical fields he creates, would be EXACTLY the same sort of thing that
Helen Vendler does with a different set of names. Either way, poets lose.

        Look closely at the issue of who the Christopher Beach book
serves. He says nothing in it that the so-called language poets didn't say
twenty years ago, and he says it more poorly, in the pale academic prose
that is the stock and trade of his marketplace. So clearly it's not a book
for poets, since we've heard it all before. Is it a book for language
poets? Only if their goal is to be canonized, to become part of the future
fictions that academic hierarchies will misname literature. Will it even
succeed in creating its new academic hierarchy? Perhaps, but I doubt it.
Is it a book for other academic critics to respond to and make other
careers out of while erasing the actual histories of poems and poets? No
doubt. Will it matter much in the history of literature? Mhy guess is that
in two years no one will ever read it again.

        Mark

Hello Poetics,
Another one of my damnable queries. Does anyone recognize the author/source
of the following?

"A dominant ideological formation is constituted by a relatively coherent
set of 'discourses' of values, representations and beliefs which, realised
in certain material apparatuses and related to the structures of material
production, so reflect the experiential relations of individual subjects to
their social conditions as to guarantee those misperceptions of the 'real'
which contribute to the reproduction of the dominant social relations" (54).


To explain myself, this is jotted down on the back of a work-related
document from my former job as a legal proofreader, and through the ravages
of time it was separated from information about the source (though I have
the page number!). At the time I was making rushed trips to the SF Public
Library during my closely-monitored lunch hour, and scooping masses of texts
off the shelves to read surreptiously between proofreading assignments (and
therefore feed my brain and avoid the constant temptation to jump off a
bridge).
Trying to remember my reading at the time, I know Terry Eagleton was
involved (note British spellings).

Please backchannel kathylou@worldnet.att.net
This will be *very* helpful to me, and I'll send my first-born child or a
copy of Lipstick Eleven to show my gratitude!

Kathy Lou Schultz - the quotation sounds like Althusser but
doesn't read like Althusser, if that makes any sense. Eagleton
or perhaps Perry Anderson would be a good bet; I could almost
see it as Jameson of The Political Unconscious but for the
spelling. Chris

--------------- FRACTURED HUMOROUS
                                by Edwin Torres
---------------------------------


Best known for his traveled-the-world-over performance art, Edwin
Torres’s
presence in print is unparalleled in its vibrancy. FRACTURED HUMOROUS is
contagious in its energy and humor, stunning in its turns, convincing in
its call to spend less time banking and more time being.
        FRACTURED HUMOROUS is a book in five parts with interstices and
dazzling
graphics acting as the thread that holds the book together – as well as
the
tangents that fracture it. See "TORRESIAN REVELATION: 3-16."


        --FRACTURE :: one month / with broken arm in bed--
from "ANIMAL IS POEM":

When animal sees another from its species injured
or on its way out - it clears out…away from what’s hurt:
        #1. Respect dying wishes.
        #2. Avoid getting disease.

When poet reduces mobility from letter to letter > speed reduces
to abstraction of original resolution > finite comparisons
emerge > end = silence > none = all > simplicity = minimal > motion =
        e > motive
        substance
        from wordsmith > unable
to charter new ground = surrounding environment > adapts
to newfound confinement > inability to progress =
circumstantial surroundings.

        The possibility to invent is superseded
by the probability of reduction.

        Technicolor has a dream…doesn’t include Berlin
        Who lives in Black & White
        Darkness is a dream to the days of possibility
        We are water, thirsting up soil, hungry Black & White grain
        Pollinating the center of seperation, the place of all meeting
points
        Before the ending is handed, before the buck is off’d
        Before the hunger dissipates in one fell swoop, one crumbled
expanse
wanderlust

We are the night, open-mouthed and waiting, to have our throats stuffed
With the stings of leather-clad scorpions, wrecked on stardust

the publisher and co-editor, with Paul Naylor, of Facture, a new journal of
poetry and poetics slated to appear in January 2000.

"It would seem appropriate for these murderous lyrics to be half-spoken,
half-sung by a demonic rhythm-and-bluesman in some post-apocalyptic border
town.  This is a book about that ultimate border between violence and
meaning, illuminating the truth of Benjamin's definition of history as an
accumulation of wreckage. Hill talks a high-tension lingo stripped of tense
and person, denuding & freshly wounding time and subjectivity. Here, each
line is a compressed scream, an ecstatic crossing between last & first
things, a neo-medieval chorus line of skeletons dancing ..."

New American Poetry Book Party

Ebbe Borregaard
Lawrence Ferlinghetti
Barbara Guest
Ron Loewinsohn
Michael McClure
David Meltzer
Mary Clarke Greer and Christopher Wagstaff will read Madeline Gleason's work.

Small Press Traffic and the University of California Press invite you to
this historic occasion, the book launch for the re-issue of the original
(1960) The New American Poetry 1945-60, the "singlemost influential poetry
anthology of the post-World War II period" (Alan Golding). Tonight, some of
the original New American poets will come and read from their work-Ebbe
Borregaard, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Barbara Guest, Ron Loewinsohn, Michael
McClure, David Meltzer. We hope to lure NAP's reclusive and revered editor
Donald M. Allen out from his Diamond Heights lair. In addition, the late
Madeline Gleason will be represented by her executor, Mary Clarke Greer,
and by her editor, Christopher Wagstaff (who has completed a new edition of
Gleason's Selected Poems, published by Talisman House).

re are reading the ~same~ list arent we ?

you write;

"These threads (...) about a kind of "the boys in the band"-style
regionalism and demographic query totally ignoring that this list is not
only read or used by Americans, border upon the same issue for me."

and i'd like to point out a couple small things here  -----  everybody talks
about how the internet might bring people that don't know one another
together, right? ----- that seems true enough at times ---- in that i now
have frequent email contact with a new friend in australia with folks all
over the u.s. with some in canada and a guy in brazil and if i were to list
all the contacts that have bloomed and then faded or just not gone anywhere
i cd list a lot of other places outside of the u.s.

but So What ?

i asked about demographics as i've heard so many people assert (based on
what evidence i have no clue) that the majority of the poetix list
participants were localized in NYC and SF ---- so my pposting about
demographics was simply to ask if there was any info and then in specifiying
the south (where i live if it aint obvious) was that i thought it wd be a
damned shame if it turned out that there was another poet or poets on this
list whose aquaintence and perhaps friendship i might have who cd be --- god
knows right here in atlanta or just in georgia or perhaps along the dull
stretch of I-85 between here and my family's home in NC

i hope to go to europe next year and wd like to meet poets there too, and
prior to any such trip will probably post something similra about areas that
i'm likely to visit ---- will you post again then to pin me down as some
other boy in some other band ? (undoubtedly earo-pop, no ???)

there is a great essay on the ghazal in a book called (I think) _Expansive
Poetics_ (or Poetry).  I cannot remember the author or title (I'm not much
on who but what) but it deals with the history and often over-use of the
moniker "ghazal" as well as giving guidelines for ghazals.  A great book of
ghazals is _The Green Seas of Heaven_ by Hafiz.  And let us not forget
Federico Garcia Lorca's as well...

>a collapsing of meaningful distinctions in favor of a rhetoric of
>dismissive . . . bemusement

Thank you Taylor for your interest.  May I ask you, bemusement conveys no
meaning, Taylor?  my post was bemusement in terms of severe mockery, not
outrage.  if there was a dime for every up-andcoming critic stepping on a
creative person's head, well, there'd be enough coins to make us all very
very rich.  using one form of rhetoric (bemusement/mockery) does not mean i
favor it over others in all cases.  by any means.  its legitimacy depends
upon your value system.  obviously i am a low brow cretin who resorts to
more old fashioned everyday common man techniques, which seems to you
unworthy of deployment in such a group as this.  perhaps this group has been
at this point before.  sorry for rattling skeletons.  the sound of bone on
bone admittedly is chilling.

>such behaviors from their writers and readers
that go far beyond the very general "making folks feel bad," which seems to
be about the greatest level of social violence listees can muster in their
conflicts.

social "violence"?  deploying tertiary definitions of loaded words such as
"violence" in order to sway group opinion, then, is also a form of violence
perhaps?  the friar's club, on your use of "violence," is a violent
organization then?  and then you are restraining your own violence?

>Again, not to say that isn't a problem - at the risk of adding my
voice to the calls for restraint, could we perhaps make sure to read each
other, and be willing to articulate that reading out in the open, before
resorting to dismissal out-of-hand?

actually, to be very honest, my effort was calculated.  and restraint is not
exactly a "correct" means of discourse, and I hope poets and those who love
poetry know that.  restraint is one of many means.  having a sense of humor
helps, as you and I would guess Mark both know.  Am I not to assume that he
has a sense of humor?  That he understands why I would be bothered enough to
twist his post into a punchline?

>I obviously have my intellectual investments here, rather than simply
>attack them in the "I-can-shout-over-a-DSL-line-louder-than-you" mode.

If that works for you, yes, sure, you can pursue your goals by your
preferred means.  I could say what I said quietly.  What I said was in text,
and in mixed (mostly lower) case.  technically shouting is done with ALL
CAPS.  and, heck, i WISH i had DSL.

>It might benefit us, though, to make a principled distinction between our
>practices and theirs - a little more care and attention on both sides of
>this argument, perhaps?

I don't see it as "us" and "them."  I'm a primate, an animal, making a
display about very strong feelings i have about poetry.  i am not above my
nature.  i am steeped in the animal kingdom and do not wish to insult the
good name of my ancestors by acting any other way!  and I'm childish and
perhaps naively idealistic.

i wish the group to have a great deal of cohesion.  cooperation is power.
crit often divides to conquer, and that breaks down cohesion.  perhaps this
is the root of my mockery, the distaste for such displays of superiority, as
Mark seems to try to display over Alan.  I'm a primate and said, "eek!  eek!
  no no!  you must be laughed at!" poets are largely disenfranchised, and
most are poor unless they find another way to make an income.  why not
discourage our own from disenfranchising each other?

when poetry sinks into subtle political games of manipulation and duplicity
and backchannel handshakes, well, I'll shout then, too. Why get back at Mark
through "principled distinctions between our practices and theirs"?  There
are few ways more respectable, at least in my little worldview, than being
aboveboard, than making people laugh.

i know for sure more than a few people laughed.  must they change their
ways, too?

And I say this in the open to you Taylor, because despite the fact that we
don't see eye-to-eye on method I like you and what you have to say.  If I
made fun of you here, would you laugh, or would you walk away in a puff and
denounce the means?  I'm not advocating that someone club mark over the head
or label him a dickhead or something coarse like that, and i don't think
anyone here gets that impression (I hope).

if i disagree with you, Taylor, i still see what you say as respectable and
worthy of response, even disarming aggressive responses.  Because I imagine
you can go home and say, "geez, that was stupid," or, "no, now you're being
stupid" (which is what I think you are saying here, and that's OK with me,
my "I'm with stupid" tshirt has an arrow that points to my face).

Despite how we as adults are taught to be friends, and how apparently I fly
in the face of that proper way known as RESTRAINT, i don't want Mark to be
my enemy.  i'd rather he say, "why did you say something so low to me in
public" than to decide that I am his mortal enemy.  perhaps this is the
tower of Babel and he won't understand that.  I was willing to take the
risk.

i believe Mark is on the side of poetry, and that he may be misguided if he
thinks that what he said is valuable and above even the lowest of ridicule.
obviously he has a deep love for poetry, and i know i cannot dissuade him
from that.  perhaps I can dissuade him from being a clannish elitist,
though, through mockery.  i know what i said stung, but he's probably
(hopefully) going to post again soon.  i did not call him names.  i made fun
of him, albeit in a shockingly disarming way.  but not behind his back.  how
do we formulate our gestures?

Taylor, you seem to intimate that it's the bad guys versus the good guys,
and that i am a good guy gone astray.  i am as bad if not worse than anyone
and would like not to join such a team at all.  to boot i would like to make
fun of both teams as long as I can.  I like Mark, I like you.  I dislike the
humorless stepping on heads thing.  in my experience people step on another
person's head to gain something.  mark steps on Alan's head, to gain more
space in his inbox perhaps, to gain inclusion in groups that have excluded
Alan with similar types of unengaged crit, to reinforce his friendships with
others who do not like Alan's writing.  I step on mark's head to gain a
world of poetry where (1) people can mercilessly lampoon others, and (2)
where critics do not find room to gain in their own positions by doing the
dirtywork of their masters.  And you step on my head, perhaps a soft soled
shoe, to show that i and others on this list not use ridicule and use
restraint.  You and I and Mark are no better than one another.  we just have
different means.

All the best,
Patrick

Try Muhammad Abd-Al-Rahman Barker et al, Classical Urdu Poetry, vol. 1, or
D.J.Matthews, Anthology of Classical Urdu Love Lyrics. But a simpler
approach would be to try the Encyclopaedia Britannica or a mere Web search
-- unless you really want to get into such rather difficult technicalities
as the traditional meters that used in the ghazal form, etc.

The following book has just appeared, and I thought it might be of
interest to some on the List:

Transcultural Experiments: Russian and American Models of
Creative Communication, by Ellen E. Berry and Mikhail Epstein,
St. Martin's Press.

"Contemporary processes of globalization have led to multiple and
complex effects, among them the formation of radical new modes
of cutural interaction, transcultural flows, and hybridized
knowledges--forms not easily understandable in terms of traditional
models of discrete national or ethnic cultures/subcultures.
Transcultural Experiments develops new scholarly and creative
strategies out of this intersection of cultural traditions, specifically
in Russia and the United States. Ellen E. Berry and Mikhail N.
Epstein define and enact a transcultural method as an alternative
to the legacies of cultural divisions and hegemony that have
dominated both Western and Second Worlds. The book introduces
a system of original concepts and genres of writing that will help in
mapping 21st century global cutlure: "transculture" (vs.
multiculturalism), "interference" (vs. difference), "potentiation" (vs.
deconstruction), "inteLnet" (vs. internet), ethics of imagination,
hyperauthorship, and collective improvisation. The authors make a
revolutionary argument in cultural studies that will be of profound
interest to anyone concerned with finding new modes of creativity
in the humanities, interdisciplinary thinking, and intercultural
communication."

Ellen E. Berry is Associate Professor of English and co-chair of the
English Department at Bowling Green state University. Her books
include Curved Thought and Textual Wandering: Gertrude Stein's
Postmodernism; Re-Entering the sign: Articulating New Russian
Cultures; and Postcommunism and the Body Politic. Since 1994
she has co-edited the feminist cultural studies journal _Genders_.

Mikhail N. Epstein is Associate Professor in the Department of
Rusian and East Asian Languages and Cultures at Emory
University. His most recent books published in English are After
the Future: Paradozes of Postmodernism and Contemporary
Russian Culture and Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives
on Post-Soviet Culture.

=46riends.   I'm forwarding Ammiel Alcalay's schedule for the various
readings & talks he's giving while in town next month.   I'd highly
recommend you check out any or all of these events.

In case you're not aware of his work, Ammiel's an outstanding
poet-essayist-translator-activist who's focused on the Mediterranean
region.  He's translated poetry & other writings from Arabic, Hebrew,
Serbo-Croatian, & Spanish.  Highlights of his long bibliography, off the
top of my head, are _After Jews & Arabs: On Levantine Culture_ (U Minn.),
an amazing guide to recent writing from the so-called middle east;  _For/Za
Sarajevo_ was a special issue of Lusitania magazine that appeared several
years ago during the siege of that city;  _Sarajevo Blues_ is a great small
book from young Bosnian poet Semezdin Mehmedinovic;  Ammiel's own book of
poetry, _the cairo notebook_ was published by Gil Ott's Singing Horse Press
in Philadelphia; and his newest book is due any minute from City Lights, a
collection of selected recent essays titled _Memories of Our Future_.   He
lives in New York & teaches at CUNY, Brooklyn.

Alan admires the "amazing economy of means" in the volume on Seminumerical
Algorithms in the Knuth programing series.

I wish he would apply the same economy to his own work.

Going through the mind numbing profundities of this last posting - please
Alan, where is a sense of irony, a sense of humor, a sense of proportion.
Since you bring  Aristotle in, where is the golden rule?

Alan, you ask the question, "what constitutes a stick or a symbol." Well,
sticks break bones. Symbols, I guess, don't. Because of their lack of economy
-a quality which you seem to admire in "Seminumerical Algorithms" (whatever
that means)-
your words do

John,
I think by "business" I meant that there's a lot of activity outside one's
own "formal" creative work that diesn't seem creative, or, at least, I
guess, to put my foot entirely in my mouth, not creative "in the same way."
But why should it be?  Organizing books and publishing books etc. involves
flexibility if often not outright creativity, tho I think I was trying to
place my point or point my place in some other direction.  By "business"

I think I was trying to get at the fact that writing the poems - and perhaps
also distributing them on a small scale - had to do with a distributive
function, whereas this other "business-y" aspect seemed often to have more
to do with accumulating a kind of authority wch is something other than any
"authority" with which one writes.  It's like the music business, the club
scene, I suppose, in a more diffuse way, trying to get readings, going after
publishing opportunities, etc. - all aspects of attaining some level of
authority, just so to be HEARD, and recognized as (one of) the public
figures of that activity, ie., producing materials that one feels "should
be" heard.

To call this "the business" is perhaps not quite the right term - it points
more to a real lack of community, a narrowness and the attending frustration
over how best to either escape the narerowness, or use it "to one's
advantage."  In this, the work - the primary, MADE thing - seems at times to
be forced to play second fiddle to a social occasion - though who doesn't
like a party? - in which one hopes to gain some authority in understanding
how their efforts are understood by others, and of their own position within
that understanding.  So one wants a group of ardent hearers for the purpose
of self-reification under image to an imagined common purpose.
All I'm suggesting is that the work itself, used in this way, becomes
enslaved to the purpose of its going public.  How necessary is applause with
regards to some semblance of accomplishment?  Or, in contradistinction to
this, what can one accomplish in isolation?

One likes being with one's own kind to the end of feeling "understood, yet
one also likes being with those different from one's self as a means of
feeling difference. It seems all a matter of expansion and contraction of
consciousness, that everything that happens IS "our business" yet never
reaches the level of being the sort of "business" that becomes inflexibly
authoritarian, even tho the "system" through which work becomes public is
more often a function of the proprietary than not.  How important is it, for
example, viz copywriting, that more persons than you and a small circle of
more-or-less intimate acquaintences know that you and you alone (influences
notwithstanding) have written whatever you have written?  And if it IS
important, how many other people ("strangers") need to know this in order
for the work to somehow establish a place for itself as an individualized
version of The Tradition, say, in this pretty shadowy public sphere?  The
Business, as such, I think,

comprises the ways in which the work is made to seem legitimate by being
made also - and perhaps primarily - part of the legal corpus of ownership.
The business of (self-) publicizing then becomes, I suppose, a way of
sharing, although one based on power established, if I may say so,
essentially from the top down.  But then, poetry has always been a system
partner of, and participant in, a continuous - if at times a-historical
SEEMING - oligarchy.  Perhaps

a little more humor could be exercized in the ways through which the
absolute reign of the maker in the MADE world makes his/her way into what
might usefully be thought the humbling spectre of extensive public view.  In
a word, the question here becomes what do we believe we are delivering?  Or
what do we have each to give?  Or, what can we BE, together?

Someone recently posted, to the effect that people in alabama were into
regionalism....(this they took to be bad, and were fairly sniffy about
it.......)

What interestes me about most of the poets that i know in the south, is
how much they are interested in *community* and how little they are
interested in *regionalism* ...

This should hardly be surprising..since they are more likely to care
deeply about Coolidge or Stein, Koch or Palmer, Hijinian or Cerevolo,
Mackey or Baraka, than James Dickey or even Charles Wright....

Many things are a'stirrin' in dixie, and they ain't regionalist:  there
are more poems, and more interesting poetry scenes, in heaven and earth,
than are ecompassed in yer philosophy, Mr. Dorow!

Websters II New Riverside University Dictionary, 1988


it's a simple fact of life in our society that people must be able to provide
for themselves monetarily. if one wishes to criticize the business elements
of poetry, please consider looking at the larger picture in which this
situation exists. most people are not able to financially support themselves
through their poetry, their publications. this is almost laughable that i
even wrote this last sentence, as it is so blatantly obvious.

as both a poet and publisher, i cannot ignore the fact that it costs money to
put work forth into the world. even self-publishing--paper, pen, printer,
whatever--requires money. let's not forget stamps, envelopes. last i checked,
these were not free either. maybe i'm looking in the wrong places? what about
web publishing--i pay for internet access, paid for this computer at which i
now sit, etc., so nope, that's not free either. sending work out to others to
publish: well, there's still that computer and printer and paper and stamps
to be thinking of. unless i'm going to go use someone else's computer and
printer and paper and stamps. do i borrow, barter, repay somehow, or do i
just take and not give back? which has parallels with what happens once
someone is published in a journal...there's that work you're reading, yours,
someone else's...there it is, right there, in the midst of someone else's
resources i.e. book, journal, whatever. you get the experience, the pleasure,
the gain yes the gain the benefit of reading it, holding it, looking at it,
flipping the pages or clicking buttons...do you choose to simply ignore the
fact that it took time and money and a whole lot of dedication and
determination to bring this product forth? or do you go ahead and subscribe
to some publications, purchase small press books, encourage and actively
engage in the wide range of what it is to be a poet in this society in this
time at this place at this moment and why aren't you going right now to buy
some book off the spd website at once or grabbing an envelope and writing a
check to a small non-spd-carried publication that has come across you lately
that you liked that you enjoyed that you set aside without thinking about the
cost the costs involved.
the business of poetry is there whether you choose to look at it or not. to
ignore it is a protective stance, a protected position. not everyone has the
ability to / interest in maintain(ing) this posture.
to bring it--the financial concerns of poetry--to light in a criticizing
manner, pointing fingers at those who cannot avoid the simple math of needing
to make ends meet, is unfair, detrimental...and contributes to the
continuation of the limited availability of non-mainstream publishing.

...and then there's this networking thing...
there are so many tangents, elements, aspects of this whole "business"
thing...

networking.
hard to know sometimes what is going on. is this person talking to me b/c
s/he knows i publish books? does s/he want something from me? or is this a
gesture of friendliness, a desire to participate in the larger poetic
conversation?
do i want to always assume the worst, clam up, turn off, turn away? or do i
want to leave myself open, believe that the conversational effort is from a
place of genuine interest? and is it not genuine interest to want to be
published, to, by being published, enter into the conversation in a larger
way, reaching more people? this is very confusing.
i want to know the poets in my community, and in the larger community as a
whole. some i know are doing interesting publishing projects, some are being
published, some are doing/hosting readings/performances--i want to know
what's going on, who they are, what they have to say. am i networking?
i do know of some people i've been warned away from, those who i've been told
go through friends in a rotating cycle, when they've finished with their
usefulness to them...that might be networking, but i'm not sure, really--it
sounds more like resource-depletion to me.
most poets i know are interested in the genuine conversation. who the hell
else wants to talk about this stuff? not too many other people, tho recently
a business (that word again) banker started talking to me about emily
dickinson and dorothy parker, which impressed the hell out of me.
so what is this networking anyway? really?
curiously,

Because this is such a great quote, and because I'm sure others on the list
are dying of curiosity:  It's from Terry Eagleton's *Criticism and
Ideology: A Study in Marxist Literary Theory*.  I as well first thought
Althusser ("Ideology and the State from *Lenin and Philosophy*), but that
makes sense since Eagleton was highly influenced by Althusser during this
period of his thought.  Also note the Raymond Williamsesque "values"
(*Marxism and Literature*).

The Vancouver Videopoem Festival
presented by The Edgewise ElectroLit Centre

November 7, 1999, 8pm
Video In Studios, 1965 Main Street, Vancouver, BC
Admission $10

The first Videopoem screening event ever held in Canada. The
hybrid genre, videopoetry, has received little attention in
our country despite being a creative field of growing
interest for Canadian artists since the 1970’s. Vancouver’s
own Edgewise ElectroLit Centre Society is hosting this
inaugural event where the cutting-edge of this innovative
medium is explored and presented. Work from Canada and
beyond will give local audiences a survey of the
accomplishments in videopoetry in the past 20 years. Hosted
by Kedrick James, improv poet, host and director of Bravo
TV’s Planet Poetry.

Features:

Verbomotorhead, Vancouver improv ensemble doing a video
production of e.e. cummings what if a much of a which of a
wind.
Adeena Karasick’s Alphabet City: “Through the continual
questioning and reworking of traditional modes of language
structures and usages, Alphabet City plays itself out within
a politics of discomfort, hostility, secrecy, exclusion and
interference. And, like the cityscape itself, language
emerges as a semiotic slough, and functions as an economy of
ruses, detours, complications; zones of problematization.”
Patricia Smith (U.S.) teams up with poetry video guru Kurt
Heintz in Chinese Cucumbers about a lover lost to HIV that
creates “a kind of wild acceleration and simultaneous
sinking feeling — and with all the mad cuts flying at the
end there's no way out for the viewer.”
(www.enteract.com/~kheintz/Fcucumbers.)
Selected work of Jill Battson, host of Muchmusic’s poetry
video series Word Up and organizer of Toronto’s Spoken Word
Festival.
Jason LeHeup’s first multi-media videopoem was produced as
part of the Judy2 launch, a “journal” he co-edits.
Activist and city politician, Bud Osborn, who’s creative
work unflinchingly examines the situation and hope in
Vancouver’s poverty culture.

Funding for The Edgewise ElectroLit Centre Videopoem
Festival has been received from the Canada Council for the
Arts and is produced in partnership with Video In Studios,
Vancouver, BC. Part of Outside the Lines, BC Arts and
Culture Week.

The Edgewise ElectroLit Centre is a nonprofit society whose
mandate is to exploit communications technology to widen the
audience of Canadian poetry and to give poets, multi-media
artists and youth the opportunity to use, learn, and create
with this technology. Videoconferencing and online
publishing are the major technologies that we work with. Our
electronic magazine can be viewed and heard at
<www.edgewisecafe.org>. Poets featured with audio include
Adeena Karasick, Wayde Compton, bill bissett and Sheri-D
Wilson. Funding for our programs is received from The Canada
Council for the Arts, The BC Arts Council, The City of
Vancouver, Embedded Spaces and Communicopia.

in defense. I can "delete" anything Ineed to--so I will not suggest
anyone say "don't write it", but I do get up to five LONG poems a day
from sd. and truly wish to spend time discussing poetics rather than
being sent the poems daily. It ain't the NYTimes! But a communtiy which
speaks.

While I agree with most of what Mark says, the passages I've detached here
make me wince --  I suspect Mark will agree, after looking carefully at the
careers around him, that writing a book about "language" poetry is probably
not the best way to "make a career" in the academy even now -- As to the
academic acceptability of "language" writing in comparison with other modes
of poetry and discourse, I suspect that I know personally every human being
who consistently teaches "language" poetry in universities, and I don't
know all that many people --

"no doubt "?

But a stick, of course, can be a symbol. And in that way, a symbol
can break bones. I'd say Sondheim's question is perfectly
reasonable-- and in the right symbolic context a potential stick for
use.

I think Todd Baron did it for me - "up to five long poems a day." I've
never sent that much out to any list and most of my work isn't partic-
ularly long.

I was also slammed for sending out something about the poetics of mathe-
matics, which I think is relevant here. But clearly it isn't.

I'm tired of the debate. My work's available on Trace. I'll send in very
very very occasionally on this list, most likely just URLs. I don't expect
very many of you to be interested, but then most of the poetics here is
literary in the oldest sense possible - and while there are new works and
writers going on, from Kent Johnson to Christy Sanford to Miekal And to
m9ndfukc.com or jodi.org - ALL of whom are relevant here - the discussion
continues in very traditional ways. I thank those of you who have suppor-
ted me of course; I'm not trying to overly-generalize or offend anyone.

Someday - if you continue to use words like "author," "poem," "avant-
garde," "experimental," "writing," or "reading" - you're going to have to
open up a LOT more than you've done. And you're going to have to open to
radically different forms of discourse, of media, of Net in all its mani-
festations. I'd suggest looking at the 7-11 list for example or the occa-
sional literary posts on Nettime.

Again, this is just my neurosis here. I'm worn out. I don't want to defend
myself or my writing any longer. I don't see any point to it. I'm excited
by a lot of new writing all over the Net, and I wish there were more of it
on Poetics. I love the writings of a lot of people here as you probably
know. But I do feel hounded out by a lot of others, and I am physically
ill at the moment, there's bad sickness in my family, and I'm really tired
of fighting the same fights I've been engaged in for decades, arguing the
same arguments. I'm depressed and stressed out, what else is new.

For anyone interested, check out the URLs below - I will probably send an
update of trAce once a week, since as writer in residence "there" I get to
see a lot of exciting things, including my own.

Alan, apologies to everyone

Dear Mr. Presjar,

you wrote,

when you actually meant me. This is quite alright, but I´m beginning to feel
an itching in my nose. In fact, I´m beginning to bite the edge of my table
at the sound of this schoolmasterly tone, but well well, a nice cup of tea
should do away with it, and for the rest, my "philosophy" will help.
Then you said something about someone being sniffy about regionalism, and I
say no and no and again no, I´m not, honest to god.
There is a certain sense of community, though, that makes my toenails curl,
and that is the kind that claims collective authority.

        A bit late to post re this, I guess, the rate we do turn over
topics here. But anyway : I am glad to see this subject discussed. It does
need it. To see the work of Dobyns so widely read---9,000 bought the
selected, did I read?--when it is such predictable, contained,
unchallenging writing, while the poetry of---oh, hundreds, but at my
random, say Kit Robinson, Steve Benson, Deanna Ferguson, Lissa Wolsak, Dan
Farrell, Nick Piombino, surely has at best one-tenth of those sales, is not
only galling, it is a crying shame.....that there are poets who are so much
more the equal of their times, scarcely remarked by a book-buying public,
while "300 CW programs" [and that AINT C & W, right?] bolster SD's sales &
thus confirm students to produce poems that continue this non-venture,
             "ah, well, it troubles my sleep,"
is an understatement, and a colossal one at that.

Look at SD's product and you will find no mystery whatsoever, each poem
wraps itself up with not a drop left over, like the last glass of the
evening, for the gods. The titles alone take care that nothing escapes. The
poems are over-contextualized up the wazoo. To me, the phenomenon of this
ilk of poetry in our day is only an extension of the new world order and
the control mindset that it would impose upon Mind, that best adventure.

I find it depressing that books such as _Body Traffic_ get published by
Penguin whereas it is harder each year for the poetry I love to get
published at all; poor people who write poetry cannot afford to subsidize
its publication, and more of us get poorer by the year.

Is there a solution? Think.

In the meantime, the failure of poetry to reach a public, frees poetry up
to be whatever it wants to be, no one to impress or hustle, none to
address, only Being & Nothingness, only Love and Beauty, In/Justice,
Oblivion, the Language and one to do it.

Well, take TWO sticks, cross them at right angles, and you have something
suitable for a crucifixion. Next, you have The Cross, a symbol. How many
bones have been broken in the name of The Cross? Even more than have been
broken in the name of The Koran, probably.

(   (  ( that's pete stephen jill
                and
           all the rest of you too


first ---- jill
               i'm feeling hampered as usual by the multiplicity of reads
that one can draw from email ---- are you angry at something i've said ?  i
hadnt meant to provoke anything like that ----- anyway, i'm not suggesting
that acknowledging the monetary realities and such of poetry publishing are
questionable and it doesnt seem that stephen was either ----- did it sound
that way ?
    you spoke of being warned by friends about certain people who use others
etc ---- sounds like high school, or, the corporate world, or academe, or...
fuck---it's everywhere ----- still, i figure it's easier to trust people and
see what happens ---- and it is maybe laughable that you wrote about how
poets can't support themselves by poetry tho i've no urge to laugh or bemoan
the situation ----- seems like i said before on this list (?) that the
alternatives gave me the willies

   i mean imagine for a minute
 the poetry world on the model of basketball
   million dollar season contracts
 competition groupies endorsements celebrity

                   wait tho...., there's jewel

you wrote;
                the business of poetry
                 is there
                whether you choose to look at it
                 or not.
                to ignore it is a protective stance,
                 a protected position.
                not everyone has the ability to
                  / interest in maintain(ing)
                this posture.

did anyone say this ? i don't think i said this ---- i recall saying that i
dont think of poetry as a business or the poetry world as a business
community ---- and that to do so felt like a self-blinding ---- and by the
passion i sense in yr response it seems you wd too ---- that is, wd you want
to suggest (based on that dictionary definition perhaps?) that poetry is
*nothing more* than one business among many ?

so when you continue with;

                to bring it--the financial concerns of poetry
                 --to light in a criticizing manner,
                pointing fingers at those who cannot avoid
                 the simple math of needing
                to make ends meet, is unfair, detrimental...
                 and contributes to the continuation
                of the limited availability
                 of non-mainstream publishing.


i feel yr anger, but at whom is directed ?  i havent intended to point any
fingers in all of this and am well aware of the simple math of which you
speak (i imagine a chorus of "he is" from the 12 or so poets who've been
waiting a year or so for my 3rd magazine to appear)

next, and it leads out of this

know how you feel, seems hard for me in dear old Australia to sell the

i still hope i'll get around to it

 but thanx
for doing these books


stephen ellis wrote;

By "business" I think I was trying to get at the fact that writing the poems
- and perhaps also distributing them on a small scale - had to do with a
distributive function, whereas this other "business-y" aspect seemed often
to have more to do with accumulating a kind of authority wch is something
other than any "authority" with which one writes. (...) ...attaining some
level of authority, just so to be HEARD, and recognized as (one of) the
public figures of that activity, ie., producing materials that one feels
"should be" heard.

stephen, i think i did hear you
amidst all my fumbling around
about this
              and it seems to me
that this 'authority' (author-icity)
                <a thing that
                kent johnson
                 and i've just been
                batting around
                 and here i think
                a point where he'd
                 take a somewhat
                different (and interesting)
                 tangent than i'm about to>
...it seems, to me at least, that
authority isnt (and i think you see this
implicitly above) isnt of any *necessity*
a bad thing
                until the work, as you say
"the primary, MADE thing" is "forced to
play second fiddle to a social occasion"

how exactly does this happen ?
what can we do about it ?  is that
jumping the gun > ~can~ we do
anything about it


tangent >>>
                   i'm chided a lot by my poetry friends for my utter
disbelief in anything commonly called The Unconscious ---- "unconsciously
you do" they say etc ---- it just seems too tidy a catch-all for things that
cd be explained but when youve got the unconscious handy it's like a
landfill behind a velvet curtain; all those pesky considerations are just
whisked away ---- and the curtain is so mysterious and the landfill stinks

i'm drawn to the idea of
dispensing with The System
of dispensing with The Business
as higher level abstractions
which it seems the more we lean on them
the more we fall far from the place
we sought to know

jill wrote/asked;

i want to know the poets in my community, and in the larger community as a
whole. some i know are doing interesting publishing projects, some are being
published, some are doing/hosting readings/performances--i want to know
what's going on, who they are, what they have to say. am i networking?

yeah
i s'pose, i do it, i cast no stones

and this ties in with stephen's increasingly more insistent questioning in
his post;

>In a word, the question here becomes what do we believe we are delivering?


>Or what do we have each to give?

>Or, what can we BE, together?

and as it seems i end up again
with nothing much in the way of answers
just some hopes
which it's been pointed out to me
one must have to stay functioning in one's ruts

but that's not the note i want to end on

stephen, jill, pete, anybody
anyone have answers to these questions ?
are they in fact questions that need answers ?
..that conceivably have them ?

Just a observation from my (very brief) perusing of the book under
discussion...there seems to be an obvious lack of attention paid to
(what Beach called) "multicultural" poetry in terms of
"experimentalism." From what I remember, brief mention was made of the
Walter Lew anthology _Premonitions_. Beyond that, however, no serious
attention paid to the highly experimental work of, say, Myung Mi Kim,
or even Theresa Cha, not to mention Amiri Baraka, or Nathaniel
Mackey...

Correct me if I'm wrong...like I said, I only briefly browsed the
book. Either way, any attempt at grappling with "Poetic Culture" seems
to me to have to concern itself with the cultures within that culture,
& find a way to displace the "rigid hierarchies," as Mark W. points
out, but in a way that moves beyond mere "academic" criticism, &
pushes more towards the hierarchies within the poetic "avant-garde" in
terms of race & poetic innovation.

dear john,
no, i'm not angry at anything you said, and i apologise for the confusion. i
appreciate your response, tho, so perhaps it was for the best after all.
what, then, was my intention? to bring up some matters that have been burrs
under my saddle, so to speak. to vent, to converse, to discuss, to take a
stand, to put my opinion into the mix.
i found that once i started, i had a lot to say.
i'm frustrated. it's a cumulative frustration. there have been several
comments i've read on the list, as well as several things i've heard around
my local (sf) poetry scene, and many conversations i've had that have led to
this level of frustration. this level which brought me to a ranting state
today. (why am i frustrated? see my 2 recent postings, for those of you who
are just tuning in here...)
so i got going, and had a lot to say, and said, and read your response, and
now i want to answer your email and let you know that i wasn't directing my
anger at you, and i want to go to sleep soon, so i'm going to answer a couple
of specific things and go to bed.

re: the networking thing--yes, john, i agree with you when you say "still, i
figure it's easier to trust people and see what happens." i do, and i do, and
usually i find that i am not disappointed. i find the term "networking" to be
problematic, and it was used in a list posting that i read and have
unfortunately deleted so cannot reference, and my networking post was
intended to be a discussion and exploration of that term and its unclear
nature, and some of the additionally unclear issues it raises. "networking"
is used as if it is a "bad" word (or a "bad word"), but really, isn't it
intended as a term to mean talking to people who are interested in what
you're interested in? like engineers talking with other engineers (train,
computer, civil, or otherwise). like poets talking with other poets. or does
it have to be this thing that is predatory or exploiting or greed-based? this
isn't really a question that has to be answered, but i think it points to the
social cliques and insider/outsider feelings that have been discussed here.
if it's not okay to talk to someone you don't know b/c it might be perceived
as "networking" (whatever that is), then the silence among "camps" continues.
a story: a certain wonderful more-established poet sat down to lunch at a
table full of youngish (i.e. not-very-established) poets at the page mothers
conference this past spring, announcing that she wanted to know what was
going on with us b/c she already knew what was going on with her peers. "are
you networking?" no one asked, b/c we didn't care what to call our
conversation. "are you looking for us to publish you?" no one asked, b/c no
one cared, no one thought of it as far as i know. we were simply flattered
that someone cared what we thought, what we were interested in, what we were
doing. we were happy to be talking with someone new, someone to spark the
conversation in a new way. we were impressed that someone "broke rank" and
came to talk with us. were WE networking? i don't think so, if it's a bad
thing, but if it's a good thing, or a neutral thing, well, we WERE all
talking, so...maybe...
(end of story interlude)
next:
and "business"? why is this a bad word? not that you, john, are saying it is
(just to be clear), but it's the sense i get, around here & elsewhere, it's
things i've read, heard, inferred, that the "business" of poetry is like
dirty laundry or something that no one wants to see. yet we are all engaged
in it.
i could argue various positions of your question to me, whether i would
suggest "that poetry is *nothing more* than one business among many"--but i
think, for simplicity and because it's late, that i'll say for now, no, i
don't think that's enough to describe what i think poetry is. there are
business elements to poetry, and there is a lot that goes into poetry that
doesn't seem to have much parallel in the business world. i'm pretty fond of
thinking that poetry is special in some way, and that business isn't special,
but it really depends on how the terms are defined. if poetry means licking
stamps and envelopes, which it sometimes does; and if business means
designing more effective methods of communication, which it sometimes does,
then business suddenly sounds more appealing to me than poetry.
it's all how the terms are defined.
if there is no definition, conversation(s) can get muddy. and sometimes even
if there are...
thank you, john, for the thoughtful response and desire for clarity.
appreciatively,
jill

        I do appreciate your caution in the brief note you sent to
poetics. Still, I think at this point it's fair to argue that the position
of language poetry vis a vis the academy is undeniably changing; it's NOT
the outcast discourse it was at one time, although it's certainly not
acadominant (as someone termed it) either. I think CBeach may be making a
pretty good career out of talking about language poetry--but note the
extent to which he does this by arguing that one of the strengths of
language poetry is that, vis a vis poetics, it JUSTIFIES itself to
contempoary academic critical paradigms. In short he's not arguing FROM
the position of the poetry itself, but from the position of an
institutional critic who allows the relevance of language poetry only to
the extent that it fits his critical discourse. It's the CRITICISM that's
dominant; poetry conforms or not (at its peril).

        And  Mark P., yes, Beach does nod in the direction of other
poetries, but isn't it also fair to say that he finds them lacking because
of the extent to which they do NOT conform to a similar set of critical
discourses? In any case I think I can grant the relevance of YOUR point
without thinking very much that it undermines my own. You see, I think
he's ATTACKING  avant garde poetry far more than he even understands; if I
understand him, language poetry succeeds primarily BECAUSE IT'S CRITICISM,
really. I worry sometimes that one of the unintended affects of language
poetry has been to further devalue the discourse of poetry as INHERENTLY
also critical; poetry matters less and less to any institutional reader,
but language poetry is okay because at least the language poets write
theory.

        Mark

Thanks to all who replied concerning my query on ghazal.  Interesting the
Herr should mention Lorca, though.  I'm familiar with his "Ghazals", but as
far as I can tell, very few of his are truly "ghazals", according to what
I've been reading about the form.  Which is why I asked in the first
place...

Thanks again to everyone who replied,

Brent

there is a great essay on the ghazal in a book called (I think) _Expansive
Poetics_ (or Poetry).  I cannot remember the author or title (I'm not much
on who but what) but it deals with the history and often over-use of the
moniker "ghazal" as well as giving guidelines for ghazals.  A great book of
ghazals is _The Green Seas of Heaven_ by Hafiz.  And let us not forget
Federico Garcia Lorca's as well...

Interesting that Mark brings up the word "community" here.  Originally from
the South myself, I noticed a definite sense of community among poets there,
both in and out of academic circles that does seem to lack in at least the
New England region, where I now live.  However, I also believe that poetry
IS in fact a "regional" art, in the (obvious) sense that vernacular,
geography, etc. all shape the way a poet formulates their art.  I don't
think something as natural as being influenced by your surroundings should
be seen as a source of contention within a "community" of poets.

The work coming out of New York is far different in many ways than the work
coming out of, say, Atlanta, and I for one embrace and depend on those
differences.

Any thoughts on "community", anyone?

     I agree with Mark's take on regionalism.  It seems that in Atlanta,
     there are more people there who are *not* from Atlanta, so regionalism
     as a sense of "place" matters relatively little.  Community, however,
     matters a lot.  The community for those poets who are interested in
     contemporary Southern narrative poetry is much larger because the
     South tends to be reluctant to compromise their traditions (which is
     their right, after all.  If I don't like it, I can return to Queens,
     NY and my own damn traditions.)  There's even a fairly large contigent
     of slam/spoken word artists here.  So, what about those who don't get
     as tickled by that stuff?

     Suffice it to say it took me over 3 years to find others in the
     Atlanta area who were interested in approaching poetics differently
     than the established majority...and most of them aren't originally
     from here either.

     I can state with some certainty that these days it seems to be easier to
     make friends on the web than it is to hang around in one's own
     neighborhood, region, what have you.  Given that, John's original post is
     only making use of effective resources.

What is generally called "business" in fields outside of strict manufacturing,
finance, services, commercial publishing, technology, etc. is generally a
mishmash of sales, hr, pr, and "soft" middle management/project management.  This
is where networking enters the equation.  While 5% (1 in 20) will "buy" anything,
a higher percentage will "buy" from someone they know, a "name they trust",
"brand they recognise", etc.  Yes, this is true with poetry.

Networking involves using skills like "working a room", "keeping a positive
mental attitude", or, what I call "kissing frogs".  It is convincing people you
don't know, who don't know you, that you have something in common with them, and
that you are a nice person.  I'm terrible at it.

True networking involves prep work including research about who will be at
whatever meeting, from which companies, what you are selling, and what you have
to offer each person. For poetry, it might be knowing who is likely to be at a
given reading, what they do and how they do it, who they do it with, and then how
what you do is similar, who you may know in common, how you can introduce
yourself.  While it sounds awfully extreme for poetry, it is very common in the
entertainment industry (including theatre), where if you aren't available for
networking, absolutely no one, even at an informal kegger, will talk with you.
Also, people take notes.  You see them in their cars after parties or meetings
writing down the names and info for everyone they met.

Jill, it sounds like you are already enmeshed in a secure network, where, since
you are a publisher, people seek you out, and since you are reletively secure,
can express a simpler interest in "what's out there".

Networking is only one of the businesslike practices that some people do
naturally and others don't.  Obviously, there is no relationship between quality
of work and networking skill, EXCEPT that in collaborative art forms and on
projects, networking skills can predict personal responsibility/accountability,
team playing, etc. Another businesslike skill is marketing, including niche
marketing and product development (i.e. "style").  How do you write poems?  Does
the way that you've written a given poem determine how you'll try to get it
published?  Hey, if you were an actor, you'd have to figure out how to stereotype
yourself.  Still another is just the mechanics of submitting poems.  What about
related jobs?  The main use of peforming, teaching, publishing a journal or web
site, writing, publishing, and delivering academic papers, attending conferences,
workshopping, belonging to AWP, MLA, PEN, winning grants isn't generating
REVENUE, it's marketing (putting the stuff on your cv), networking, and
increasing the ability of other publishers/readers to categorize you/find
something they have in common with you.  It functions sort of like government
certifications:  someone else has inspected your financials and found you're
sound, so you must be ok.

AUTHOR FELICE PICANO
Sunday, Nov. 7, 1999
7 pm
William Way Community Center
1315 Spruce Street

The William Way Center's Gay Book Discussion Group hosts guest author
Felice Picano at their November meeting.

Picano, author of the new novel The Book of Lies, is a founding member
of the Violet Quill Group, a salon of writers
that met in Manhattan in the late '70s and included Andrew Holleran and
Edmund White.  Picano is a prodigiously
talented author with over a score of books to his credit, including The
New Joy of Gay Sex, Looking Glass Lives,
Ambidextrous, Like People in History, and the memoir, A House on the
Ocean, A House on the Bay.  Please come to
meet the author, check out this new book group, and have some wine and
cheese.  Feel free to bring copies of Picano's
books to get signed; books are available at Giovanni's Room or Borders.

Set approximately 10 years in the future, The Book of Lies is a stylish
mystery, a hilarious roman a clef, a witty critique
of academia and literary criticism, and a deft character study of
contemporary artistic life.  It is also an affectionate tribute
to Picano's compatriots in the Violet Quill Club, including Edmund
White, Andrew Holleran, Robert Ferro and others
instrumental in the creation of the canon of gay literature.  The novel
tells the story of Ross Ohrenstedt, ambitious young
academic in the fashionable field of queer studies, who, in the course
of overseeing the collection of papers and works of
a legendary author, discovers a baffling and provocative manuscript.
His quest to identify its writer and gain prestige and
tenure puts him on the trail of a potential -- unknown -- masterwork
penned by one of a group of writers, some living,
some dead, who in the 1970s and 1980s broke new literary ground.  In the
novel, The Purple Circle, as they were
known, have become much revered, oft studied--the foundation upon which
numerous academic careers have been
made.  As he did with Like People In History, Picano has created an
intimate exploration of a larger historical
phenomenon, at the same time giving voice to those who lived through a
unique era offering the reader a complex,
credible human narrator as a lens through which to view them.
Advance Praise:

"The Book of Lies is funny, dark, sexy, shocking, and yes, smart.  Set
in the near future ('four decades after
Stonewall'), the novel tells of a young scholar trying to make his
academic bones on the literary bodies of the 'Purple
Circle'.  Picano skewers the pedagogically pretentious with ease and
wit.  The Book of Lies is a wonderful novel, with
some of Picano's best writing."   ~ Bay Area Reporter

week ago.

I found this at the foot of a Stephen Ellis post, to which I was led by
Charles Bernstein's rebuttal of a tale Ellis tells. I apologize for not
knowing who "Allen" is in full.

It's hard to believe my eyes. Here we are, 1999, and a poetry-lover can
still make a distinction between "real" poetry and stuff that just comes
off the tpyewriter?!? What does one put on in order to produce this "real"
poetry, one wonders? A Sherlock Holmes robe and deerstalker hat? A laurel
crown?  A gorilla suit? Does anyone here remember the anecdote Creeley
tells of reading in Indiana (perhaps there) and being asked "Was that a
real poem, or did you make that up yourself?"?

For what it's worth, in my opinion Alan Sondheim's project is an accurate
use of this List. Yes, I expect much of what he posts he has just
written---likely he writes directly onto his e-mail. I know I often do,
valuing the immediacy and the commitment. Sure, I find the quality
uneven---but that doesnt strike me as a primary worry at all. It's in the
overall that this project has most meaning. And a part of that is to
disclose the way the poetic faculty opens and closes like a flower, or a
sea anemone, and to evidence the rhythms of this process. It is an
intensely various endeavor, this poetry of his, and to that I say Amen!
Keep variousness alive or, if its already too late, bring it fucken back!
And this is not to say that some of his poems don't knock me out of my
tree, boil my potatoes and throw my oatmeal to the ceiling. I assume in
such a project there'll be poems that pass on by my individual
capabilities. I dont always download, because theres too much else to
attend to, and this in itself tells me something about the times, about
poetry, about myself and about the Internet.

Alan has set pieces---I believe I can identify some of them. But Praise the
Lawd they are embedded in lava that still flows, and not the sum total of
his writing life, not so many tombstones saying "Real dead" and "Geology
died" at the same time.

apart from the odd booklet most of my publishing activities nowadays are
small easily posted things like my MIGHTY THIN BOOKS etc etc most are done
in small runs and are only part of my usual correspondence so only go out to
current situ,,,it is now financialy too hard it seems to go to the printer
and ask for a 500 edition of something,, so a lot of my small press activity
now never sees the bookstore or general reading public, i get a lot of nice
publications in return via this more close-knit communication style of
activity,, an example would be my MIGHTY THIN BOOKS series...i ask someone
for some work that fits the format print about 15 first up for the author
stipulating they keep one and give the rest away ,,then send a few copies
out in my mail to people who have been in a Mighty Thin etc when i send the
initial 15 to the author i usually send five multiples of another Mighty
Thin so they can also give away someone else's work,, later sendings to any
author is usually 10 copies of their book with a few multiples of others in
the series etc etc this goes on with a number of different authors so a
distribution of a lot of the Mighty Thin books goes out into "a" system that
i have little control over ,, a nice system i think,, hope that all makes
sense!!!??? pete spence

It seems to this writer that there is no progress on this list except in the
direction of monologue, censorship and exclusion. The same games keep getting
played out over and over.  It's pathetic and creepy. Cycles of abuse.

Ellis's recent posts are elegant critiques that go to the heart of the
matter:  attempts to be authoritative and totalizing  freeze discourse and
encourage the useless repetitive batting at one another that has become a
mainstay of the Poetics List experience.  Interesting, creative people like
Sondheim keep getting needlessly pissed on. Use the freaking delete button.

Come on guys--and it is guys I'm talking to--get a life.

the concept that one could create something/anything divorced from their
surrounding is an enviable dictum,


but it is hard to imagine unless you think about isolation chambers &
float tanks.

Im a dyed-in-cheese regionalist, infact a bioregionalist, in fact living

Okay, so express by being. i'd post more poems but i tend to write big.
here's something short (tho wide in its usual format.)

and this brings up an old irk of mine. since i often write 80 character
lines, htis not only keaves me out of many half-sheet type magazines, it is
also limited by what can be dispalyed on the web.


 how my house fell


my house fell into a pucker of space time
and across the street or next door are at least an hours drive away
like a farm house in the middle of thousands of acres you can barely
recognize from the highway.
how driving west, you congratulate yourself for the marathon of nebraska
only to be rendered unconscious by wyoming, not as long but so more
hopeless,
sucking up every drop of momentum, sweat & possibility
when all you want to do is get out, get through the first vanguard of
mountains
and into utah swept so clean, clenched so tight, it wants you to roll
through,
is afraid to check our pockets

or we’re deep in several concentric mazes of the city, like getting from the
bronx to manhattan on foot,
or my friend whose address in taipei was avenue 57., alley 16, block 4,
building 11, apt 203:
we’re defined by the grid, refined by the sheering abscissas  systems
inadequate to drain everything away, our mass attracting energy,
    the commerce of isolation,    the need to zip the door around you
like a sleeping bag, a sleeping bag that could support you in space for at
least a week:
the time for someone to find me or for my various parts to vote on which
dimension to escape to
and how many of them can access,     who’ll be left to talk about it,
locked in a silicon chip floating through space, the molecular bondage of
memory
stronger than vacuum    gravity    crumpled in a fist of wet pavement

why

dependent
on
books
why
cyberspace
can
distribute
literature
to
an international

at very
little

9000

of a book

kind of
audience
is easily
had on
internet.

when the nytimes
reviewed a visual poem of mine
I had that many viewers in a week.

now hits doesnt equal sales of books
but buying a book doesnt mean the

Im not dissing books, Ive been a publisher of handmade books since 76,

Has been some discussion in Raven Chronicles
http://www.speakeasy.org/ravenchronicles/ about what consititued Pacific
Norhtwest poetry, particularly what encompassed local poetry in the Seattle
area.
Here in Oregon the 'official' 'local' poetry, as practiced by a majority of
those with full time college teaching gigs, has william stafford as its
icon. a good poet friend (who needs to protect his job as college adjunct)
descirbes it as 'hillbilly chic,' its cool to be rural, very
representational tho also terse.
the unofficial local poetry here in Portland OR, exisiting via open mikes,
coffee hourses, and to some extent the slam scene has bukowski as the chief
icon, tho ginsberg and kerouac have altars not too far to the side.

It seems to me that part of what Jill Stengel is highlighting is the
importance of *access* and that not all poets/writers have the same access
to "community" and publishing opportunities. And, yes, if we get very clear
and very honest about this, a lot of this is about money (and other aspects
of class mobility such as education). Bobbie West states it very clearly in
the HOW2 Forum on class & poetics that Robin Tremblay-McGaw and I co-edited
(and, yes, I do want to pitch this because I think the contributors worked
hard and did a great job with limited time and space on a very difficult
topic):

"When it comes to literary production, class pervades every aspect of it.
For people of the lower classes, the common denominator is "have-not"
status, starting with the glaring absence of the middle/upper class
assumption that it is always possible to achieve what one desires. There's a
lack of cash to support money-losing ventures such as poetry magazines and
small presses (owner/editorship of which gives one instant recognition).
There's a lack of access to the Internet, where one can hobnob with
publishers and magazine editors (publication being determined partly by who
you know: For example, this particular essay appearing in this particular
forum is a result of having met someone [Kathy Lou Schultz] at an academic
conference and having contributed to an Internet discussion)."

I find it interesting the extent to which poets will go to obfuscate their
own or other's class privilege. It is like it is perceived as "impolite" to
actually tell the truth about money -- and who has it. I get very tired of
this because money does buy access: more time to write, money to publish
one's own journals and books, which in turn increases  both community as
well as publishing opportunities for one's own work by increasing your
"profile" and "reputation."

Let's just say for now that I'm pretty clear that if I still worked at the
Hinky Dinky grocery store in the town in Nebraska where I grew up, ya'll
wouldn't be seeing my name in print at all.

And lest you think I'm just pointing fingers, the quote from Bobbie
implicates both Bobbie & myself, in a way laying things bare, and saying,
yup this is how it works. As women from working class backgrounds we're both
inside and outside of that, straddling, yet trying to keep it as real as
possible. Not easy. Sometimes painful. Always interesting.

Respectfully,
Kathy Lou


Jill Stengel wrote:
as both a poet and publisher, i cannot ignore the fact that it costs money

to bring it--the financial concerns of poetry--to light in a criticizing

needing

Dear Alan Sondheim and all,

Being swamped with work, I have been only skimming this list of late, and
very selectively. I know there have been some criticisms of Alan's
postings, but didn't realize the thing had gotten so acute. I don't have a
very clear idea of the nature of the debate (I'd be grateful if someone
gave me a brief summary), but I'm sorry to hear that it has caused some
unpleasantness. I have read Alan's book, _Reality Disorder_, with much
interest, and would very much like him to keep posting here. Alan, have you
been asked to stop posting? That's ridiculous! And where I can I read your
stuff on the poetics of mathematics?

Don't give up and don't despair! This, too, will pass.

Yours,

Philip Nikolayev

director of The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church in New York where, as
well as teaching her legendary Experiments in Poetry Workshop, she produced
the Poetry Project's reading series.  Mayer's position made her a central
figure in the community of artists and writers gathered at that time in New
York City's Lower East Side.  With her husband Lewis Warsh, she edited
United Artists press, which published a number of seminal books of poetry,
including Ted Berrigan's Sonnets and Mayer's own Utopia.

Tinfish is pleased to announce the publication of Nell Altizer's sonnet
sequence, _Thin Place_. Those of you teaching the sonnet form in coming
semesters will, I hope, consider using this chapbook in your classes.
Anyone interested in the sonnet, nay in poetry, should have a look.
Copies are $5 each.

Forthcoming volumes from Tinfish include work by Rob Wilson, Bill Luoma,

and Ida Yoshinaga.  (We'll be returning to our more "experimental"
format.)

Copies of Kathy Banggo's _4-evaz, Anna_ are still available.  Several of

my colleagues have used this book, which includes poems in both standard

and Hawaiian Creole English, in their classes, to good effect
(poetry _must_ be taken internally).

Issues of Tinfish are still available, as well.  They can be purchased
for
$5 each or $13 for a subscription to three issues.  Tinfish is an
entirely
self-supporting enterprise (aside from mailing), so your financial, as
well as your spiritual, assistance is most welcome.

aloha, Susan

        This will be an imperfect announcement, as I dont have all the
info. But I dont want to delay making it, given the time-lapse on our
moderated list.

At the Poetry Project, St Marks Church. next Wednesday, Nov 3, Elizabeth
Fodaski and I shall be reading from our own writings. I think we begin at
7:30 p.m. I dont know what the door-charge is.

I look forward to seeing some of you Listmates there.

Thanks for your attention,

While I don't intend to sound either rude or ignorant, the substance of
Catherine Daly's post makes me slightly itchy, as if I were allergic to
something - but what?  Terms like "middle management" and suggestions such
as figuring out 'how to stereotype yourself' (albeit this was referred to as
"if one were an actor", yet it also applies, I think, here, to "if one were
a poet" or, "if one were to be a successful poet") lead me to ask whether
poems themselves, as such, are merely tools with which one may enter the
systematized world of product marketing, the product most often being the
person rather than the poem?  It seems very weird that a poem might be
thought of as a marketing device, tho perhaps this might help explain the
increasing interest in developing new theories and ways to define and effect
audience.  It's as if a broad field of possibly ardent and definitely
un-listening hearers took place in the hopeful imaginations of those who
take this 'noisy silence' as permission to continue making what seems very
much the equal of dress sheilds for the deaf.  Perhaps this is the
"government certification" Ms Daly speaks of, being brought under inspection
to find out whether one's "okay."  But what's that smell wafting gently
upwards from the poetic corpus, the gangrenous elation, perhaps, of group
agreement preserved in some ledger of "sound financials"?  & is there
anything in this worth resisting?

Subject:      Re: on regionalism...
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Brent and list:

Has regionalism been annilated by discussion groups? Certainly IDG's have
been somewhat successful in breaking down social barriers between central and
peripheral poets, thereby increasing the size of the invisible community, the
invisible college, if you will.

The significance of these opportunities offered by IDGs for the creation of
new contacts or even for collaboration between other poets is underlined by
other recent trends in the lists. This was begining to come true even in the
old days (circa 1984), when we used early versions of electronic bulletin
boards to increase our level of mutual awareness and acquaintance.

The by-product of the IDG's, that interaction, is often initiated because of
other reasons. I get information from a colleague about a theme although I
originally posted another question. Once the informality begins to happen,
this also drives the breakdown of regionalism. The informality is what I
think is at work here. Someone asks a question and another member(s) provide
an answer. A third member reads the answer and realizes that the author is
working on a similar topic and cites relevant literature....

Collaboration is also the breakdown of regionalism: the emergence of
collaboration between individuals, while it depends on aspects like their
backgrounds...their specific pursuits...has the same effect, especially when
the IDG offers possibilities to become aware of potential partners for
cooperation and collaboration that can be approached within or outside the
IDG. Thus, stimulating a volumne of communication within the IDG you may
solve the problem of "planning the consequences of unplanned action in poetic
communication", for example.

I want to say that the "regionalism" (and I don't see this as a problem)
seems to be formulated in terms of existing approaches, existing theories,
schools, if you will.

Creatures like this list offer a simplifying assumption that every actor has
full information, which means she knows the shape of the production function
and the amount of resources that was contributed by the other groups
members.This commonality, this common standard of comparison for the "costs"
of the participants and the value of the collective good, is I believe,
another erosional factor.

The only thing I can see that shoots all of this full of holes is that regiona
lism is anchored by social contexts, and that there can be no authentic
freedom from this embededness. This may lead to our communication taking the
form which is somehow less influenced by social control. Status differences
play a small role in this, driving the amount of communications, since they
are not face to face communication.

Then there's the topic of "fleeing the regionalism" into an IDG. We all have
our own goal-chain. Differences in subgoals depend on differences in the
constraints that lead to different production functions. For some it may be
the attainment of a "poetic reputation", an important driving force. The
relevant group for a poet is the poetics list, a community, that is, the
other poets who aare doing works in a similar direction. It seems that the
crucialmeans for a participant to obtain a poetic reputation is to solve
poetic problems and to present his/her competence to this community. Access
to information is therefore essential for him. This network of poetic
colleagues is important in two respects. It is a pivottal instrument to get
relevant information which is necessary to solving poetic dillemas. On the
other hand, it is as well the crtical audience for sending valuable
information.

This building of significance is how I see the erosion of regionalism.

best, Gerald

This is puzzling and quite, quite bizarre:

my post was merely relating to how others (with whom i guess you align
yourself, right?)  were displaying all their massive superiority "over" D.
Raphael.....  as i've said numerous time, there is much that is strong and
interesting in Sondheim's work;  was gonna back-chan. this, but on 2nd
thought it probably should go on the list....

Do you actually read the things you respond to??

        yeah, it's used that way
        and also used in the more
        specific way that catherine
        outlined in her post today
        saying;

Networking involves using skills like "working a room", "keeping a positive
mental attitude", or, what I call "kissing frogs".  It is convincing people
you don't know, who don't know you, that you have something in common with
them, and that you are a nice person.(...) True networking involves prep
work including research about who will be at whatever meeting, from which
companies, what you are selling, and what you have to offer each person.


        and it bears mentioning
        that it was i
        who posted the bit
        about networking, i wrote;

i'm reminded of something someone told me about going to a reading and the
young poet who was reading that night marched up introduced themself to
everyone and was later heard to say "I LOVE NETWORKING!" ---- is that the
same sort of "business" ?

        and the just ref'd "business" in that post
        was the thought of how getting published
        in various ways might
        "open doors" for oneself etc

        that is i was thinking not of monetray things
        but how one get's known, seen etc

now the person that told me the I LOVE NETWORKING story, i think, felt that
there was something questionable in the way this was approached as if the
statement had been I LOVE SCHMOOZING ---- or to cite a current commercial i
find amusing where all these little kids are talking about what they want to
grown up to be "i want to have brown nose"

> >> >>>tangent: that commercial is trying to sell me something right ? why
have i absolutely no idea what after having seen it a bunch of times ?

but, to continue ---- when this i heart networking story was related to me i
wasnt so sure that i knew what was meant or whether there was anything at
all to be suspicious of ---- hell, my first trip to LA, i was there very
briefly and didnt know anybody really so what did i do ?  i made a lunch
date with marjorie perloff and hung out with douglas messerli at sun & moon
had drinks met guy bennett etc ---- managed to track down the elusive
standard schaefer and then it was time to go

was i networking ?  i'm sure that suspicion has been born in hearts of some
---- i guess i'd rather think i was meeting people, making friends even

anyway

Alan,

Why are you quiting when most of the responses (at least publicly) have
been supportive?  What if someone doesn't like your work?  Much of what
you put on line does not interest me, but I've grown fond of searching for
the moments that I like -- and I'll defend your right to the death to
splurge.  Complaining and composing should be second nature by now. No
one, complainer or composer, should be demonized -- and I hope no one's
distracted from their chosen obsessions.  In fact, it's amazing that
you've been posting as long as you have without someone taking issue with
your work sooner.  Consider it a compliment.

hmm.  let's see now, Mark.  (trying to use the war metaphor, to enhance

in your attempt to defend insults coming from Raphael and you attacked
people who were defending alan for being creative and sharing, and also
people who are trying to keep people on the list from becoming overly
self-conscious when posting.

you seem so insistent to play war games, alignments, schools, etc.  i ALIGN
myself with, well, NOT aligning with people who align AGAINST creative
expression, if we must stick to your divisive vocabulary.  musicians poets
artists people with umbilicals to something greater than flesh and selves.
based on the evidence i don't expect you to understand that.  if you do,
great.

Yes, there's no doubt that the position of language poetry within the
academy is changing, as is my own.  Standpoint theory taught us what we
already knew.  To the 80% of professors (such as my not-so-humble self) who
teach well outside the gravitational pull of the stellar research
universities, the thought that anyone might think that writing on language
poetry was a way to advance one's career is, well, nearly unthinkable --
There are people who have good careers and who write about language poetry
-- but few of them GOT HIRED in the first place because of writing on LP --
and few will get recruited to a better job because they do -- BUT, as Mark
says, that's all changing -- what has always been particularly strange
about the discussion with regard to LP and the academy is that the charge
that LPs wrote "that way" to appeal to theory-ridden academic critics or to
get academic positions preceded the actuality of any of this happening by
more than a decade -- perhaps those people I heard complaining along these
lines back in '82 or so were simply far more prescient than I am --

But yes, there are now anthologies from major presses with academic sales
-- there are now dissertations being written, books accomplished, imitators
wrestling with the resistance of their fellows in their creative writing
workshops -- all the signs of a significant coterie success --

but none of that is WHY anybody wrote the poetry or WHY any critic chose to
write about it

(nor is this, any longer, a response to Mark W., whose fine Christmas poem
is something everybody should read for the sheer pleasure of reading)

poetry is a criticism of life, wrote some regrettably Victorian fellow --

Poetry will continue to act as critique no matter what anybody in the
academy does to it --

Discussion of WHY we think SOME LP has been taken up by some FEW academics
needs to be carefully distinguished from other activities, like reading the
poems -- At the same time, each of us reads always from some ideological
WHERE, though it's more an arc of motion than a site, and anatomizing that
arc is part of any truly critical reading

Professor Beach was last seen teaching at the University of California at
Irvine,a very good job indeed -- Anyone taken a glance lately at the list
of poets who teach at Irvine?

In his introduction to ARTIFICE AND INDETERMINACY, Beach reminds readers of
Alan Golding's comments on the "provisionally complicit resistance" of LP.
I think Alan's phrase may be the most apt descriptor of the present moment
of LP within the academy --

Alan's phrase is also a nearly perfect description of the attitude with
which one enters the reading of a new poem -- much more accurate than
"willful suspension of disbelief," I believe.

I was the one who first called language poetry "acadominant," and I
still think I was right to do so in the sense that language poetry is
THE poetry of prestige among academics.

As for Beach, I know nothing about him, but I strongly suspect he's
never given as much as a nod toward visual poetry (except whatever he
thinks he's found of it in language poetry).

As often, i wholeheartedly agree with Kent,  Alan S is producing a
singular, unique and monumental work and i've seen very little work as
strange and exhilirating as his maybe since Charles Olson, if there's two
pieces a day or twenty pieces a day I'm happy to see it.  The same is true
for Lyn Miller and Kevin Magee, let's have more and Patrick Herron was
sending some really new work there for a few days, i hope they weren't
parodies, he's found a vein worth mining.

dan
always have difficulty with poets who imagine they're advancing their work
by slagging masters with a different poetics. Stafford's no hillbilly, he's
an amerkan, he's a poet of soul, he may express sentiments but he's not
sentimental and he connects with millions.  maybe if you wrote one poem as
good as the hundreds of stafford's that have touched me deeply, it might
sound less like sour grapes.  do the work, you don't make yourself look
better by trying to make others look worse.

I'm grateful to Jerrold Shiroma for mentioning Myung Mi Kim. Her book
"Dura"  (Sun and Moon, 1998)  along with Christopher Reiner's "Ogling
Anchor"  (Avec, 1998) and Guy Bennett's "Last Words" ( Sun and Moon,1998)
should not be overlooked in the rush of that overly eventful year's quick
fading into the millenium.

Sorry I haven't had more time to contribute to this list of late which I
have been enjoying whenever possible as an appreciative lurker.

And hang in there Alan Sondheim. We need you!

I will presume Dan Raphael can be taken at his word. He states, in a
response to the open channel support for Sondheim that “Maybe i should
have back channeled to sondheim asking him about his work.” Fine, a slip
of the e-tongue. Could happen to anybody. Forgive and forget.

It isn't difficult, but never easy enough, to understand that people can
be very discouraged by public statements of disregard.  Again, let's
take Raphael’s plea that he is not in favor of censorship. The fact is
that disrespectful, dismissive to insulting comments in public, although
not censorious, can   throw a charge into air. A charge that can make
some people feel unwelcome.

I welcome and admire Alan's postings. I appeal to Alan to understand
that his posts are valued by a good number of people on the list,
ignored by some and disliked by others.

I have a folder in which I save posts that think are important.
Sondheim’s stuff accounts for about 70 per cent of the folder. The
criticisms of Sondheim’s work that I have read on the list have been
trite, shallow and irrelevant. The idea that this type of thinking  can
set a standard for the character and content of what comes at me through
the list angers me. The list provides fleeting glimpses of

Alan, please don't go off  the list because your work has drawn negative
flack in public or back channel posts. Maybe you've had more overt
attacks on your work on back channel. It's probably harder than I think
but, try to blow these turkeys off and continue your work on the list.

Hello,
I can't believe that Alan Sondheim has left the List! If he does indeed stop
posting, then I want to say, in a very old-fashioned and sincere way, SHAME

If you didn't appreciate his efforts or his poetics, why couldn't you just
delete his posts? Your attempts at censorship are ugly and brand this List

$8.82
My brain is a blank afternoon
at the end of a century of lies,
the hollow thumping is my
blood against fences,
the random flinging of my hands
composes a reason for living
as though I'm painting a hidden sidewalk
only my enemies walk on
until they flower like dancing
which I do in my room all alone
with shadowed lamps and walls that say
this wreck is building the days,
clamor of a dubious underworld
that sings of my defeat

MOTION STUDY

At dusk in the top bunk your plastic squadrons approached.
With decal snarls, they hung from the ceiling from invisible threads,
dim silhouettes, countless old war movies, the quiet onslaught.

Black Lionel locomotives shone poised on the shelf
--trackless--without the morse of their oily, false smoke.
Your room  a secret terminal, the motion beginning.

You studied each constellation stalled on your wall,
the varied wings of your insect collection: moths tidily pinned,
cobalt dragonflies, thoraxes striped like fuses.

Lying on the floor one afternoon, you pulled rubber bands taut,
shot down each swaying model airplane. You perfected the whining
fall and the throaty sound of their exploding.

All through the evenings your wrenches hurriedly rang
the cement; the car rocked on its blocks as you raced the engine.
Legs forked out on the ground like a divining rod

from beneath your Austin-Healy's shining flank,
you completed the apprenticeship,
saw in the sooted heavens how all along you'd been

greasing the gears of your own departure.

i wish the group to have a great deal of cohesion.  cooperation is power.
crit often divides to conquer, and that breaks down cohesion.  perhaps
this is the root of my mockery, the distaste for such displays of
superiority, as Mark seems to try to display over Alan.  I'm a primate and
said, "eek! eek!
  no no!  you must be laughed at!" poets are largely disenfranchised, and
most are poor unless they find another way to make an income.  why not
discourage our own from disenfranchising each other?

**********************\

This is puzzling and quite, quite bizarre:

my post was merely relating to how others (with whom i guess you align
yourself, right?)  were displaying all their massive superiority "over" D.
Raphael.....  as i've said numerous time, there is much that is strong and
interesting in Sondheim's work;  was gonna back-chan. this, but on 2nd
thought it probably should go on the list....

Do you actually read the things you respond to??

THERE IS A NAME FOR THIS SOMEPLACE IN RHETORIC I'VE LONG SINCE FORGOTTEN BUT
THE RIFF WHEREIN YOU START BY DENIGRATING YRSELF THUS IMPUTING THAT
JUDGEMENT TO THE PERSON YOU ADDRESS
        (i am not shouting, i am
         speaking at normal volume,
        not even typing hard
         on my keyboard)
I THINK IT'S PRETTY WELL DONE ACTUALLY INSINUATING THE "YOU THINK YR ABOVE
ME/ TOO GOOD FOR ME" VIBE AND WAVING VAGUELY, INDETERMINATELY IN THE
DIRECTION OF "THIS POINT" A PROBLEM THE SPEAKER SEES OBVIOUSLY AS RECURRENT
ON THIS LIST AND IT CLOSES WITH A BIT OF POESY IN HIGH TONE "BONE ON BONE"
ETC

                restraint is not exactly
                        a "correct" means of discourse,
        and I hope poets
                and those who love poetry
        know that.

> restraint is one of many means.
>
                having a sense of humor helps.

        i know for sure more than a few people laughed.

I'VE NOT HEARD ANYONE LAUGHING (i am not shouting) ---- WHEN IS MOCKERY,
WHEN IS PROMPTING SOMEONE, EVEN EXPECTING SOMEONE TO SAY "why did you say
something so low to me in public" NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM "STEPPING ON
SOMEBODY'S HEAD" ????

                in my experience
                 people step on another person's head
        to gain something.

WHAT HAS BEEN GAINED ?


(HENCEFORTH I WILL BE SHOUTING IN LOWER CASE)

patrick, yr correct that restraint or reasonableness have no privileged
position as rhetorical means or as means of any kind, as perhaps
"rhetorical" isnt that useful in this context ---- but as i think you might
agree, there are better and worse ways of moving forward

you say that you bear mark and taylor no ill will and i'll take you at yr
word on that, i do not doubt it ---- but let me say that i think yr choice
of mockery as response, whether a hold over from more primal human responses
or not (THAT'S MEANT TO BE SORTA FUNNY SOUNDIN') does, to me, seem
particularly useful ---- yr entitled to yr response of course, i don't mean
to squelch that but i do have questions about the contour of this whole
business; you feel mark stepped on alan's head and taylor was stepping on
yrs but saying he wasnt and it looks to me like yr stepping too, on foot on
each (AUDIO CUE; TARZAN ROAR) and i'd like to say

        that i have just
         stomped yrs into putty
        with my display of
         ~reasonableness~
        and i'm doing this to gain something

(the right to lay my head on the next stair ....? )

so now it's my fault.  hmm.  ok, whatever makes you feel better.

Actually using all caps _is_ textual shouting in the internet culture.  it
is a fairly common convention.  but, as you must, as you must.

>I THINK IT'S PRETTY WELL DONE ACTUALLY

Thank you, John.

>WHEN IS MOCKERY, WHEN IS PROMPTING SOMEONE, EVEN EXPECTING SOMEONE TO SAY
>"why did you say something so low to me in public" NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM

Actually to this mortal sin i have already confessed, i did, i did!

>WHAT HAS BEEN GAINED ?

Probably nothing.  The motives don't always necessitate their desired
outcomes, with which I am sure we are all familiar.

>(HENCEFORTH I WILL BE SHOUTING IN LOWER CASE)

Taylor, I bear no ill will AT ALL.  One sentence came off completely wrong
in my reply to him.  Mark, i tossed jokes like feces at his expense (yes, i
was stepping on his head, but with a clown shoe, not an iron tipped boot)
when he bears ill-will toward those who use their creative abilities.
Otherwise, no ill will to Mark either.  can this end?  i think people are
missing the point and playing wargames here.  this is POETRY not WAR.  (that
was shouting).

>you feel mark stepped on alan's head and taylor was stepping on yrs but
>saying he wasnt

and i added that i was stepping too.  ain't no half-steppin'.

>(AUDIO CUE; TARZAN ROAR) and i'd like to say

getting funnier, with a little use of irony!

        >that i have just
         stomped yrs into putty
        with my display of
         ~reasonableness~
        and i'm doing this to gain something

much better, and sadly much worse.  you seem to insinuate physical violence
on me with this "stomping yrs into putty" stuff, which scares me a little,
frankly.  stepping on someone's head is an expression to denote that someone
insults or denigrates another person just to impress or gain the favor of
another person.  "stomping into putty" is perhaps not quite the same thing.
i like the audio cue of tarzan, that's funny.  but i don't like to think of
someone crushing my skull and its contents "into putty."  i find nothing
humorous about that, and if you do, you clearly need help.  i really can
take humor, but not potential threats of violence.  i really doubt you are a
violent person, John, but then I have little knowledge of who you are and
probably wouldn't take such a violence-laden statement so well from even my
best friends.  who can rib me pretty awully but not make it gory.

AND can we keep the harassment offline for the rest of this?  Alan is gone.
Other poets probably feel reluctant to post anything creative.  this has
sunk lower than even Raphael's original post (or, from your perspective,
even lower than my reply to mark).  victory is yours.

Patrick

Subject:      THERE'S NO VEMBER LIKE NOVEMBER AT THE ZINC BAR
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Make it a november to remember over at the ZINC BAR SUNDAY NIGHT READING
SERIES this upcoming month.  It's cut short by Thanksgiving, so we've
compressed four weeks of quality into only three readings.  How do we do
it?  A keen ear & our obsessive compulsion.

Here's who's here next:

SUNDAY NOV 7: KATY LEDERER & KESTON SUTHERLAND
SUNDAY NOV14: TAYLOR MEAD & WAYNE KOESTENBAUM
SUNDAY NOV21: JOHN COLETTI & CAROL MIRAKOVE

But where's here? The Zinc Bar is located in New York at 90 West Houston
between Laguardia & Thompson & in Webster's between zillions & zingy.

All readings begin on Sunday at 6:37pm except on the 28th, Thanksgiving
weekend, when Brendan & Douglas will come to your home & introduce the
turkey for twenty minutes while your horrified family wonders when they'll
be allowed to eat.

O yes, a donation of $3 goes to the readers.  If you have it to give.  Give
more & maybe the poets will jot a quick ode to their newfound benefactor.
What do we get out of the bargain?  Something between zero & zilch.

If you want to pick up a copy of LUNGFULL! Magazine, we're always eager to
unload them at the reading.  If yr really flush, we wouldn't stop you from
buying us a drink.

If it's more information you want try 212.533.9317 or 212.366.2091 or
lungfull@interport.net or better yet, just come down to the Zinc Bar &,
perhaps, the answers will emerge.

Please note: a couple open mikes are almost upon us.  On October 31, the
Halloween costume reading -- come in a costume & step up to the
zincrophone.  One possible response to this opportunity would be to come in
a costume that entirely obscures your identity & read the poem you've been
too scared/ashamed to read ever before.   Brendan will be coming as A Cloud
in Trousers & Douglas's get up is TBA.   & then later in December, the
frequent flyer open mike -- show up 4 times to hear other people here at
Zinc, beginning a couple weeks ago, & in Dec. you can turn the tables &
read your own work back.


Will we see you soon & often?  In abject hope for the future & on behalf of
man about town Douglas Rothschild, I remain your trusty Brendan Lorber.
Good night.

First I got a lot of backchannel support, as did I assume those who find
my stuff obtrusive on the list. Second, below is part of thinking about
'poetics' from a somewhat personal viewpoint, as well as two recent pieces
(traditional) trying to come to grips with this issue. I'm hoping for com-
ments. I'm honestly not crying wolf here or asking for support (though
obviously I appreciate it).

I think what's lacking here, at least for me (and possibly some others) is
exactly what one means by poetics - and then, given that, what body - of
literature, people, texts, or media - that word should be applied to,
here, on this list - Alan

---------------------------


1 (Def. rewritten from http://trace.ntu.ac.uk )

"I think of poetics as looking at relationships among forms, phenomenolo-
gies, literatures, in relation to writing/ inscription on one hand, and
the body on the other. One might include the earth as well, and the foun-
dation of the earth or the articulation of logics and structures beneath
the surface of the earth. In other words, what happens when a mouth
speaks, when words resonate, when empathy and not equivalence is primary?
This is a far cry from the politics of poetics, from the poetics of liter-
ary form, from the tropologies, scansions, and stanza patterns of poetry,
although all these play a role. But one might ask as well, within the body
of poetics, how does number play the world? How does the speaking of num-
ber align the body? How are body and world in relation to fundamental
structures of the real, such as the classical Umwelt with its things that
mostly retain shape, with its identities and typologies, with its Boolean
logics? And one might also ask, within poetics, about the relation of mu-
sic to the body, to speech, to the history of being-human. Poetics in this
sense brings everything into play, from cognitive psychology and neuro-
physiology to the mathesis of the real, and the dreaming of the body, of
the mind, and all terms wavering in the midst of the worlds murmurs and
sounds."

One might ask the style of the world, one might ask its breathing -



2 Smart Poem Remains Forever


Here I'm writing a poem.
This line's under the first.
The lines stick on the page.
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
It's the beginning of graphics.
There's space to the right of the lines.
There's space above and below.
You've got to give space to the poem.
It feels like meat on the bones.
But it doesn't move; it lies here.
It's already a corpse to cry about.
WAAA! WAAA! The corpse of the poem.
It's good to write death about death.
Our lives are from earth to earth.

Here I'm continuing the poem.
This stanza's under the first.
The stanzas stick out on the page.
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
Look at the shape of the stanzas.
There's a bit of a shape, not too much.
Byron's Don Juan has shape.
The Ancient Mariner has shape.
Sometimes the poem spreads out.
It thinks the page is a body.
It lies there dead on the page.
Chuff chuff says the poet's breath.
Rereading the line, I keep breathing.

I want a poem that leaps off the
page and continues when the voice stops.
I think the poem will be a good
imitator, life won't go on as before.
It will sound and shudder, speak back,
jump, clawing your neck. It travels
thousands of miles in broken packets
machinery has to put together in
order for it to return to the condition
of the poem, and even then something
else might happen, a letter leaving,
image heaving.

Where are the broken poems that keep
breaking?

There's a dampness to lines of poetry.
They seethe into the page.
Think of Bishop Gavin's translation.
Something's crying to continue!
Who could be under the stones?
What's the map in the foam of the surf?
It just sits there. Poems are great markers
Of the human condition and the times we are
living in.
Inside the book, they face each other
all the times.



3 and letters


letters fall over and lie there as well.
if this had been a book, you would have read this long ago.
the pages, yours, letters swollen, loving your mouth.
the grist of letters among protrusions of the flesh.

all letters sing only of sex and death.
love appears along their splines or embrochures.
it is the ancient science of letters.
never confuse this with material or spiritual wealth.

letters survive and murmur and couple and mourn.
letters need nothing, not even our speaking and writing.
the page is a trap is a cemetery is a constant death.
letters burn black fire white smoke in sullen truths of skies.

what we see is their death, what we know, their death.
nothing of their song or the spike of them in tongue.
your mouth gets in the way, they don't want to leave.
our lives are seduced by each and every page.

letters, leave us.
letters, leave us.

Glad that Dan Raphael posted a poem after his comments on Alan S.

Glad too that his comments precipitated so much support for Alan.
Where were you all before?

Sad that Alan is ill and thinking of drastically reducing his posts. When I
first joined the list some years ago one of the first posts I downloaded
was one of his on the early days of the net.  Like so many others his posts
are an important part of my sense of the list.

Sad also that yet another shake-the-hand-that-shook-the-hand barb aimed at
Charles Bernstein went almost without comment. If anyone else on the list
had been treated like that there'd have been uproar. I hope. Don't see why
the listowner, or anyone else, should be subject to this kind of thing.
It's disgraceful.

Mime-Version: 1.0

Your post, particularly the section about no longer working in the hinky
dinky grocery store where you grew up, having now grown into seeing your
name in print, hits a particular nail square on the head, but doesn't drive
it anywhere (aka "where's the wood?").  To begin to accomplish this would be
to ask and attempt to answer a rather difficult question: what value does
'seeing your name in print' - or having others see it - have, to what end,
and for who?  Ie., how exclusionary is it?  Does it probably exclude the
person(s) who remain back home (no longer home to some) at the rinky dinky
roller rink of the repetitious yet possibly common life of those who work
the buy-and-sell scheme to ends at considerable variance from your (and each
our) own?  While I'm not suggesting that anyone need read their poems to a
truck drivers convention in order to "get real"

I'm wondering what the conventions of seeing one's name in print lead (lean)
towards?  And as far as simply admitting that one is "of" a working class
background, and (yet) has networked one's way into a different (higher?)
form of access to intelligent consideration of The Fix, let's call it - is
this "confessional" mode really anything other than a way of side-stepping
issues that are perpetually brought up by a whole class of previous
side-steppers?  I get the feeling that somebody's (some bodies) are being
left in the lurch of us all getting to see our name up in lights.  Since
it's a pretty low-wattage elevation, I can't help but wonder what it effects
viz. the class issues you're trying to introduce, especially in terms of
access; you're speaking of access to just what, exactly?  If you're speaking
of participatory opportunities, and the apparent lack of these among the
less-privileged classes, then what is it you hope to accomplish, either for
yourself, or for those you seem to be suggesting you've partly left behind,
by hoisting yourself from what seems one rinky dink situation to another
whose difference is mostly in the issues of access and priviledge you are
now wont to descry?  Are you now some sort of "spokesperson" for those left
sorting lettuce deep into the night?

While I can respect wanting to "lay things bare" in this situation, I don't
believe that your laying claim to an understanding of the class structure of
literary production as you've presented it - ie., excusing yourself without
having even posed, let alone attempted to make answer to, some very tough
questions regarding your own position along the lay lines of what looks to
be a pretty unmapped and for now, over-simple field of metaphor - goes far
enough.  I think that people - all people - "want to know", ie., for
example, who they are, what they are, in the overall daily struggle of
seeing themselves into and through activities that seem (and possibly ARE,
to them, as to us) sufficient to life.  So, for example, what do you
imagine, or know, the particular values and prejudices, whether class
determined or more simply "human" in some broad sense of "wanting" (what?)
that make this sufficiency as various as it is, to be?  The place where your
name gets to be in print

is always "elsewhere"; the values and prejudices that go to specify an
individual's sense of the life in them being sufficient unto itself in terms
of what they do, happens where they are, where we are, where you are.  And
where, I'm wondering, is that?  Ie., in what position viz. the social
community, or, for that matter, the cosmic stream of stars (not to say in
what exchange of words) do things, as you say, "become as real as possible"?

I also would strongly recommend that Patrick and others take this rather
creepy and dead-end thread off the list....But i note that he wants others
to do it, and wants to be able to get the (inaccurate) final public word

Bemusement certainly carries plenty of meaning of its own. What I responded
to in your post was the way that very meaning was constructed by
parasitizing and ultimately vacating the other very real meanings of social
scale at work in the discussion: e.g.,  that what the Times accomplishes in
the deployment and installation of ideology at a transnational scale is
_not_ the same as what Mark proposed at the ultimately rather small scale of
the 10% or so of list participants who were likely to be paying attention to
this thread. That, for example, his call for Alan to exercise a kind of
prior restraint on his productions in this forum, however much one might
take issue with it (and I do - I think you and I agree there), is orders of
magnitude away from the ability to rig the mechanisms of political debate in
order to foreordain the ideological victory and material "progress" of the
neoliberal empire - which ability _is_, concretely, the medium of the Times'
work.

This is not to say I find no room for mockery or hyperbole in these
discussions - simply that the level of hyperbole involved in your equation
between two such disparate practices seemed to obscure an accurate
assessment of the situation. Public discourse should (how's that for
prescriptive and censorious?) flash and crackle with wit, but when the
requirements of a good joke at your interlocutor's expense overwhelm those
of accuracy - well, call me dour and bloodless, but it makes me nervous. Of
course there are effective sites for that kind of
mockery-and-the-rest-be-damned approach: one thinks of Lenny Bruce's
portrayal of cops and judges, or Malcolm X's "chickens coming home to roost"
comment. What's most telling in these instances, for me, is that the
speakers are articulating their positions against the context of a real
social violence which has effectively closed off the possibility of further
debate. In the face of attempts to destroy a life and livelihood, or at a
much larger scale to effectively decapitate and liquidate a people's
insurgency, Bruce and X's refusals to distinguish between good and bad cops,
between J.F.K. and J. Edgar Hoover, emerge as necessary responses to
situations one might call, without exaggeration, life-threatening. In such
circumstances, sure, let the barbs fly, and sort out the details if they let
you live to see the aftermath.

And that was, as I saw it, the source of my description of "social violence"
as operative in these engagements. Read my post again. I think it makes
fairly clear my sense that the _real_ social violence is that being
perpetrated by wholesalers of ideological consolation for empire like the
Times...and that the most we can muster in this particular space, in
comparison, is a fairly benign emotional aggression or petulance. That it is
ridiculous to compare the scale of this to that of the Times' operations by
resort to the same term of definition was, for me, precisely the point. Far
from a scare tactic, I employed it as a means of deflation. But in your rush
to mold my comments into a target for mockery, you've bypassed this fine
point, as you've bypassed the ironic inflection of my use of the word
"restraint." Again, please read what I wrote: the post begins with a
criticism of restraint as a viable mode of practice for this list. The
comment from which you draw the presumptive conclusion that I'm a
standard-bearer for exactly that restraint is actually doing work completely
opposed to it. "At the risk of adding my voice to the calls for
restraint...", i.e., it's a risk, something I wouldn't want. "Let me not be
misunderstood to be suggesting," etc., etc. I realize irony doesn't carry so
clearly in email, but that one seemed fairly well evident to me.

Which brings me back to my original stake in this thread: Might we not
reasonably expect that, on a list devoted to poets and scholars of poetry,
participants in arguments would read each other's writings with a certain
amount of care? And that this reading would include an attention to the work
being performed by those writings in a sphere understood to be at least
somewhat larger than the daily P-List tally of who got the leg up on whom?
This isn't a call for "politeness" or restraint - simply my wish that when
we depart from civility (as at times, all "citizens" must [and how much more
so those faced with exclusion from _that_ designation]) - that we engage in
such departure out of a sense of necessity, and with an understanding of
_what_ it is we've chosen to make the target of our tactical
misapprehensions.

Then again, I had my sense of humor surgically extracted before going to
Buffalo back in '94. It's cold there, and humor being the delicate organ it
is, the climate often turns it bitter and malignant. Many of us chose to
have it amputated. Now that I'm in San Francisco, shuttling Volvo-wise up
price-speculating hill and down multimedia gulch through the autopoiesis of
the armies of the painfully, painfully earnest, I don't miss it at all.
We're all very centered and happy here, except when we're not.

Without a trace of irony, but thoroughly strapped in, cinched up, and
otherwise restrained,
Taylor

Thank you Taylor for your interest.  May I ask you, bemusement conveys no
meaning, Taylor?  my post was bemusement in terms of severe mockery, not
outrage.  if there was a dime for every up-andcoming critic stepping on a
creative person's head, well, there'd be enough coins to make us all very
very rich.  using one form of rhetoric (bemusement/mockery) does not mean i
favor it over others in all cases.  by any means.  its legitimacy depends
upon your value system.  obviously i am a low brow cretin who resorts to
more old fashioned everyday common man techniques, which seems to you
unworthy of deployment in such a group as this.  perhaps this group has been
at this point before.  sorry for rattling skeletons.  the sound of bone on
bone admittedly is chilling.

>such behaviors from their writers and readers
that go far beyond the very general "making folks feel bad," which seems to
be about the greatest level of social violence listees can muster in their
conflicts.

social "violence"?  deploying tertiary definitions of loaded words such as
"violence" in order to sway group opinion, then, is also a form of violence
perhaps?  the friar's club, on your use of "violence," is a violent
organization then?  and then you are restraining your own violence?

>Again, not to say that isn't a problem - at the risk of adding my
voice to the calls for restraint, could we perhaps make sure to read each
other, and be willing to articulate that reading out in the open, before
resorting to dismissal out-of-hand?

actually, to be very honest, my effort was calculated.  and restraint is not
exactly a "correct" means of discourse, and I hope poets and those who love
poetry know that.  restraint is one of many means.  having a sense of humor
helps, as you and I would guess Mark both know.  Am I not to assume that he
has a sense of humor?  That he understands why I would be bothered enough to
twist his post into a punchline?

>I obviously have my intellectual investments here, rather than simply
>attack them in the "I-can-shout-over-a-DSL-line-louder-than-you" mode.

If that works for you, yes, sure, you can pursue your goals by your
preferred means.  I could say what I said quietly.  What I said was in text,
and in mixed (mostly lower) case.  technically shouting is done with ALL
CAPS.  and, heck, i WISH i had DSL.

>It might benefit us, though, to make a principled distinction between our
>practices and theirs - a little more care and attention on both sides of
>this argument, perhaps?

I don't see it as "us" and "them."  I'm a primate, an animal, making a
display about very strong feelings i have about poetry.  i am not above my
nature.  i am steeped in the animal kingdom and do not wish to insult the
good name of my ancestors by acting any other way!  and I'm childish and
perhaps naively idealistic.

i wish the group to have a great deal of cohesion.  cooperation is power.
crit often divides to conquer, and that breaks down cohesion.  perhaps this
is the root of my mockery, the distaste for such displays of superiority, as
Mark seems to try to display over Alan.  I'm a primate and said, "eek!  eek!
  no no!  you must be laughed at!" poets are largely disenfranchised, and
most are poor unless they find another way to make an income.  why not
discourage our own from disenfranchising each other?

when poetry sinks into subtle political games of manipulation and duplicity
and backchannel handshakes, well, I'll shout then, too. Why get back at Mark
through "principled distinctions between our practices and theirs"?  There
are few ways more respectable, at least in my little worldview, than being
aboveboard, than making people laugh.

i know for sure more than a few people laughed.  must they change their
ways, too?

And I say this in the open to you Taylor, because despite the fact that we
don't see eye-to-eye on method I like you and what you have to say.  If I
made fun of you here, would you laugh, or would you walk away in a puff and
denounce the means?  I'm not advocating that someone club mark over the head
or label him a dickhead or something coarse like that, and i don't think
anyone here gets that impression (I hope).

if i disagree with you, Taylor, i still see what you say as respectable and
worthy of response, even disarming aggressive responses.  Because I imagine
you can go home and say, "geez, that was stupid," or, "no, now you're being
stupid" (which is what I think you are saying here, and that's OK with me,
my "I'm with stupid" tshirt has an arrow that points to my face).

Despite how we as adults are taught to be friends, and how apparently I fly
in the face of that proper way known as RESTRAINT, i don't want Mark to be
my enemy.  i'd rather he say, "why did you say something so low to me in
public" than to decide that I am his mortal enemy.  perhaps this is the
tower of Babel and he won't understand that.  I was willing to take the
risk.

i believe Mark is on the side of poetry, and that he may be misguided if he
thinks that what he said is valuable and above even the lowest of ridicule.
obviously he has a deep love for poetry, and i know i cannot dissuade him
from that.  perhaps I can dissuade him from being a clannish elitist,
though, through mockery.  i know what i said stung, but he's probably
(hopefully) going to post again soon.  i did not call him names.  i made fun
of him, albeit in a shockingly disarming way.  but not behind his back.  how
do we formulate our gestures?

Taylor, you seem to intimate that it's the bad guys versus the good guys,
and that i am a good guy gone astray.  i am as bad if not worse than anyone
and would like not to join such a team at all.  to boot i would like to make
fun of both teams as long as I can.  I like Mark, I like you.  I dislike the
humorless stepping on heads thing.  in my experience people step on another
person's head to gain something.  mark steps on Alan's head, to gain more
space in his inbox perhaps, to gain inclusion in groups that have excluded
Alan with similar types of unengaged crit, to reinforce his friendships with
others who do not like Alan's writing.  I step on mark's head to gain a
world of poetry where (1) people can mercilessly lampoon others, and (2)
where critics do not find room to gain in their own positions by doing the
dirtywork of their masters.  And you step on my head, perhaps a soft soled
shoe, to show that i and others on this list not use ridicule and use
restraint.  You and I and Mark are no better than one another.  we just have
different means.

All the best,
Patrick
